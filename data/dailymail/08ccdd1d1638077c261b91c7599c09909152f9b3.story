An Oklahoma hospital in Garth Brooks' hometown must pay $1million to the country singer because it failed to build a women's health centre in honour of his late mother, jurors ruled Tuesday evening.

Jurors ruled that the hospital must return a $500,000 donation to Brooks plus pay him $500,000 in punitive damages in Brooks' breach-of-contract lawsuit against Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital in Yukon.

Brooks said he thought he'd reached a deal in 2005 with the hospital's president, James Moore, but sued after learning the hospital wanted to use the money for other construction projects.

The hospital argued that Brooks gave 
it unrestricted access to the $500,000 donation and only later asked 
that it build a women's centre and name it after his mother, Colleen 
Brooks, who died of cancer in 1999.

'Obviously we are disappointed, 
particularly with the jury's decision to award damages above and beyond 
the $500,000,' Integris spokesman Hardy Watkins said. 'We're just glad 
to see the case come to a resolution.'

Brooks called the jurors 'heroes' and said he felt vindicated by their verdict.

'I no longer feel like I'm crazy,' he said.

Jury member Beverly Lacy said she 
voted in favor of Brooks because she thought the hospital went back on 
its word. As far as the punitive damages, she said: 'We wanted to show 
them not to do that anymore to anyone else.'

During the trial, Brooks testified 
that he thought he had a solid agreement with Moore. Brooks said the 
hospital president initially suggested putting his mother's name on an 
intensive care unit, and when Brooks said that wouldn't fit her image, 
Moore suggested a women's centre.

'I jumped all over it,' Brooks told 
jurors in tearful testimony. 'It's my mom. My mom was pregnant as a 
teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out 
there.'

His attorney told the jury during closing arguments that Brooks kept his end of the agreement.

'This case is about promises: promises
made and promises broken," lawyer John Hickey told jurors shortly 
before they started deliberating. 'Mr Brooks kept his promise. Integris 
never intended to keep their promise and never built a new women's centre.'

But hospital attorney Terry Thomas 
said Brooks' gift initially came in anonymously and unrestricted in 
2005. He also noted that Brooks couldn't remember key details of 
negotiations with the hospital's president - including what he'd been 
promised - when questioned during a deposition after filing his lawsuit 
in 2009.

'At most, it was a misunderstanding 
between these two,' Thomas told jurors during his closing argument. 'Am I
calling Mr. Brooks a liar? Absolutely not. It's perfectly 
understandable that he does not remember these events.'

The jury began deliberating Tuesday 
afternoon in Rogers County District Court, and the judge told jurors she
wanted them to work as late as midnight to come to a decision.

Before the verdict was read, Brooks 
said the day had been emotional. The country music star said he was 
simply trying to honour his mother.

'This little pistol, she deserves nothing but good,' Brooks said.

‘I jumped 
all over it,’ Brooks said. ‘It's my mom. My mom was pregnant as a 
teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out 
there.’

Brooks said he gave $500,000 to the hospital anonymously, which he said was his custom when giving to charities.

The
singer said he, his family and the hospital wanted to keep things quiet
until a ribbon-cutting ceremony to announce the centre.

He
was shown architectural drawings of a proposed centre bearing his 
mother's name. ‘That's why I thought it was a win-win for everybody,’ he
said.
