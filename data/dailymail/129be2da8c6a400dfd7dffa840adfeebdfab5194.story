A mother of two was denied her right to breastfeed her seven-month-old son at a hospital childcare centre in Sydney on Monday.

Allison Smith was at The Children's Hospital at Westmead when a centre volunteer told her she couldn't feed Charlie in a public lunch area.

Instead, the 32-year-old claims she was forced into breastfeeding her son in a 'disgusting' storeroom strewn with toys.

'A staff member came up to me and said "you can't breastfeed there",' Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

'She said "you can feed your baby in the storeroom".

'So I went to the storeroom and fed, they peered through the window and retorted that I wasn't even feeding. I returned the next day and fed in the dining area and they made remarks to each other, one stating that her daughter used a cover.

'They were just being bullies.'

'I was distressed and embarrassed,' said Ms Smith. 'I thought I was allowed to breastfeed freely in Australia.'

This not only came as a shock to Ms Smith, a single mother of boys Charlie and two-year-old Henry who both have rare and complex medical conditions,Â but also to pro-breastfeeding group Lactivists Australia.

In light of the incident, the activist group will lead a 'nurse-in' peaceful protest at the hospital, also known as Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, on Friday afternoon in order to raise awareness about the kind of discrimination faced by breastfeeding mothers.

'Time and again we are seeing women made to feel ashamed simply for breastfeeding,' spokeswoman for the group Victoria Brookman said.

'For some reason, some people have it in their minds that they have a right to discriminate against a breastfeeding mother.'

Ms Brookman wants today's message to be plain and clear: 'it is illegal and unacceptable to ask a mother not to breastfeed, to cover up or to move elsewhere'.

'A woman's right to breastfeed her child is protected under The Sex Discrimination Act (1984) protects a woman's right to breastfeed anytime, anywhere.'

The hospital has since apologised to Ms Smith, stating that it was a 'misunderstanding'.

But Ms Smith said this wasn't the case.

'I value and respect the assistance of the care team at the hospital but there was no misunderstanding on Monday. It was directive and the rude remarks solidified my perception,' she said.

'The hospital said there are dedicated areas for feeding. I said my body is capable of and designed to feed anywhere.'

Ms Smith is currently raising funds for both her ill children.

Her youngest son Charlie survived a stroke within 24 hours of birth but now suffers from apnoea and seizures.

Her eldest, Henry, is hypertensive as he is missing the two crucial arteries - one to each kidney. As a result, he suffers from very high blood pressure.
