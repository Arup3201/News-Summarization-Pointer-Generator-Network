One of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history will be replayed in a Colorado courtroom — but only after an unprecedented jury pool of 9,000 people is winnowed to a handful to decide whether James Holmes was insane when he opened fire in a suburban movie theater.

Holmes is one of the few suspects to survive such an attack — many are killed by police or commit suicide. His survival has sparked an emotionally charged debate in which his parents have begged for a plea deal that would save his life, while many survivors and family members of victims have demanded that he stand trial and face the death penalty if convicted.

Jury selection begins Tuesday, and the trial could run until October. It could provide a look into the mind of Holmes, whose attorneys acknowledge was the gunman in the July 20, 2012, attack but say he was in the grip of a psychotic episode at the time.

'The public is going to get an insight into the mind of a killer who says he doesn't know right from wrong,' said Alan Tuerkheimer, a Chicago-based jury consultant. 'It is really rare. It just doesn't usually come to this.'

Holmes, 27, was arrested as he stripped off his combat gear in the parking lot of the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, where 12 people were killed and 70 injured during a midnight showing of a new Batman movie.

He later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder. If jurors find him guilty, they must then decide whether to recommend the death penalty. If Holmes is found not guilty, he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital.

Under Colorado law, defendants are not legally liable for their acts if their minds are so 'diseased' that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Part of the reason the case has dragged on so long is the battle over whether that standard applies to Holmes.

Few details on those arguments have been made public. Prosecutors and defense attorneys remain under a long-running gag order, and court documents detailing the issue have stayed under seal.

HOW THE JURY WILL BE CHOSEN: Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. called an unusually large number of people for jury duty, citing the difficulty in finding an unbiased panel. 

Samour expects it to take until May or June before he can find 12 jurors and 12 alternates. 

Prosecutors will try to ensure jurors have no reservations about the death penalty while defense attorneys will look for those sympathetic to mental illness and uneasy with the idea of executing a person.

WHAT JURY LIFE WILL BE LIKE: Jurors won't be sequestered — isolated in a hotel — but will be allowed to go home every night. 

Samour will tell them they may not discuss the case with anyone, do any independent research on it, or watch, read or listen to news reports about it. 

Their names won't be made public, and Samour has forbidden news organizations from taking their photos.

THREE PHASES IN JURY SELECTION

Holmes' sanity was evaluated by a state psychiatrist but the results were not made public. Prosecutors objected to the findings and persuaded a judge to order a second evaluation. Those results were contested by the defense.

Prosecutors previously rejected at least one proposed plea deal made by attorneys for Holmes, criticizing the lawyers for publicizing the offer and calling it a ploy to draw the public and judge into what should be private plea negotiations.

Survivors of the attack and family members of victims have had a long time to get ready for a trial.

'We've all been to therapists and have talked to our families and have our support groups, so we're prepared,' said Marcus Weaver, who was shot in the arm and whose friend, Rebecca Wingo, died in the attack. 'It's gonna be quite the journey.'

It could take until June to find 12 jurors and 12 alternates who were not biased by widespread news coverage of the shooting.

Insane? Jurors will have to decide both whether Holmes is guilty and if he's sane enough to answer for the crimes

Jurors will see the majority of the gruesome photographs and video taken at the crime scene, but a handful of images will be barred, the judge overseeing the case ruled on Tuesday.

Defense lawyers had argued the photos could prejudice the jury against Holmes, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

But prosecutors countered that they were necessary to make their case against the California native, and Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour rejected most of the defense's motion in his ruling, saying images which depict the aftermath of crimes charges are allowed.

'That many of the photographs will be difficult to view does not render them inadmissible,' Samour wrote, adding that the same logic applied to the disturbing video footage recorded inside the cinema following the rampage.

Prosecutors have charged Holmes with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder, and have said they will seek the death penalty for the one-time neuroscience doctoral candidate if he is convicted.

The judge said he was 'disinclined' to allow into evidence one photo showing a disemboweled woman, if the prosecution could provide a less graphic version.

Images of a bloody emergency room where victims were treated are likewise inadmissible, Samour ruled, because their value is 'substantially outweighed by the danger for unfair prejudice.'

Photos and video taken inside Holmes' car that show a skull-shaped gearshift, and which the defense wanted barred, will be allowed because they depict part of the crime scene, he said, but prosecutors cannot tell the jury the defendant's choice of gearshift reflects any criminal intent.

Samour did agree with defense lawyers who asked that a photo showing an undisclosed poster on the refrigerator in Holmes' apartment be cropped or blurred, saying the poster could offend some jurors.

Jury summonses were sent to 9,000 county residents this month, and jury selection is set to begin in January. Samour has told lawyers from both sides to prepare to make their opening statements in late May or early June.

Last week, Holmes' parents broke their silence over the killings, saying their son is mentally ill, 'not a monster,' and should be spared the death penalty.

Equally challenging will be finding jurors who were not personally affected by the attack that sent waves of grief and anger through the Arapahoe County suburbs of Denver.

Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. called nearly nine times as many prospective jurors as were summoned in the ongoing Boston marathon bombing trial. That meant the county's 600,000 residents had a nearly one-in-50 chance of being selected.

Among those summoned were at least 13 people who were either witnesses to the attack or have family members who work in the prosecutor's office. They were quickly excused.

Starting Tuesday, prospective jurors will report in groups of about 250 to fill out a long questionnaire that hasn't been made public. Those who aren't excluded because of their answers will be called back for individual questioning.

Potential jurors won't be allowed to read or talk about the case until they know they've been dismissed. That will be difficult in the era of social media, since they have no control over what pops up on their Facebook or Twitter feeds. The final panel won't be sequestered.

During the selection process, Holmes' attorneys will focus on picking jurors who are morally opposed to capital punishment, even as prosecutors fight to ensure those on the panel are 'death-penalty eligible,' meaning they would be open to executing Holmes.

'It is really stacked against the defense,' said Joseph Rice, managing partner of the Jury Research Institute, a California-based trial consulting firm. 'Here, you have a horrific crime occurring in a public setting where you think people would be safe. ... Because of the heinous nature of the crime and the number of victims, I can see people who would say, 'In most instances I could not support the death penalty, and in this case, I can.''

Enduring the trial from the jury box would seem more difficult than the selection process.

'This is going to be a life-changing event for every juror who sits on the trial,' Rice said. 'They are going to deal with life-and-death issues that will forever be part of their experience.'
