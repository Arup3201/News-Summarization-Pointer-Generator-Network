Grieving families who were unable to identify the remains of their loved ones who died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, may finally be able to lay them to rest with the help of DNA.

Scientists in New York are carrying out painstaking work on the last known fragments of people who died in the World Trade Center- hoping to use DNA to be identify those who remain missing.

Each day a dedicated team of forensic scientists sift through thousands of vacuum-sealed plastic pouches filled with bits of bone rest in a Manhattan laboratory.

On Saturday, the 7,930 pouches are due to 
be moved in a solemn procession from the city medical examiner's office 
to the new trade center site.

They will be kept in a bedrock repository 70 feet underground in the new September 11 Memorial Museum that opens May 21.

The museum will 
charge $24 for entrance but the remains will not be a part of the 
exhibit.

The move will mean that families who have effectively been living in limbo since their loved-ones were killed on that fateful day will have somewhere that they can go to be with the remains.

The
 remains will be accessible only to families of the dead and to the 
forensic scientists who are still trying to match the bone slivers to 
DNA from the more than 1,000 victims who never came home and have never 
been identified.

However, while the bereaved families have long endorsed the 
ongoing identification process, some have protested against this weekend's move of the remains.

They fear that the museum site could be prone 
to flooding after witnessing the aftermath of Super storm Sandy which swept through lower Manhattan in 2012, flooding buildings and causing widespread water damage.

Rosemary Cain, a mother who lost her firefighter son at the World Trade Center pleaded at a protest on Thursday: 'Don't put them [the remains] in the basement.'

'Give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in 
peace,' she said.

However, Mark
 Desire, who oversees the four-member World Trade Center team in the 
city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, is keen to stress that the 
remains will be treated with the utmost respect.

'Our commitment to return the remains to the families is as great today as it was in 2001,' he said.

Over
 2,753 people were reported missing at the World Trade Center after it was 
attacked on a sunny September morning in downtown Manhattan.

Of
 those victims, 1,115 victims - at least 41 percent - have not been 
identified through a DNA match to items provided by families — 
toothbrushes, combs, clothing or swabs from relatives.

But technological advances in DNA testing has given the families renewed hope as the process of identification has become far easier than it was a decade ago.

Families want to be able to formally find their lost loved
 ones by using the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone.

It
 is, in fact, the only hope for families waiting for anything tangible 
to officially confirm what they already know: their loved one died.

In
 some cases, scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or 
15 times, using new technology to attempt to extract DNA diminished by 
fire, sunlight, bacteria and even the jet fuel that poured through the 
towers.

Four new identifications were made this past year.

By
 December, the latest technology will have been applied to every remnant
 in the medical examiner's possession, exhausting the available methods,
 for now.

Beyond this year, 
families who still have not been given any hope of finding their family 
members, will face uncertainty about how long and at what cost the 
forensic team will keep working to identify these last 9/11 remains.

The team's annual budget is $230,000, plus costs for follow-up work by other scientists and staff.

However, Charles
 Strozier, founding director of the Center on Terrorism at the John Jay 
College of Criminal Justice, said that work must continue 'because our 
relationship to the September 11 disaster hinges on being able to 
identify and pay respects to those who died.'

He said: 'The World Trade Center attack was more cruel than death usually
 is, because some people were simply incinerated and those remains went 
into the air.'

For Mr Desire and those like him who work on the remains, it's not just a grim scientific task — it's  personal.

He
 said that Ms Cain's missing firefirghting son was under the 
still-standing towers minutes after the two hijacked planes hit them, 
having rushed down with the then-chief medical examiner, Dr. Charles 
Hirsch. As the towers toppled, the men were struck and bloodied by falling glass and debris.

Mr Desire sees it as his duty on behalf of his country to find them.

He said: It's a service and an honor, working on something that has transformed American history.'
