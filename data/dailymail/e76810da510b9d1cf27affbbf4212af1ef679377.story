Shopping addicts not yet bleary-eyed from Black Friday took to their computers, tablets, and SmartPhones Monday for what could turn out to be the heaviest day of online spending ever.

Online sales are expected to top $1.2billion, up 20 per cent from last year’s $1billion, showing American’s growing comfort with shopping for goods on the Internet.

Cyber Monday, which started in 2005, has continually grown in popularity, but this weekend, a record 226million Americans surfed the webs for bargains on electronics, toys, and clothes.

Growing trend: Last year, more than 100 million consumers shopped online on Cyber Monday, according to personal finance security service, BillGuard

Retailers such as Toys R Us, Amazon 
and Walmart were among those hoping to capitalise on the surge with 
sales starting as early as last night.

Sales from mobile devices were up 8.5 per cent from last year, according to data collected by IBM Benchmark. And a full 12 per cent of shopping enthusiasts used a mobile device to look for deals, the analytics firm said.

One web analyst called it a ‘banner year’ for Cyber Monday.

Online shopping was also massively 
popular on a shopping day traditionally dedicated to brick-and-mortar 
stores.

Black Friday boasted $816million in online sales this year, up 
from $648million in 2010.

Possible record: Sales were up 20 per cent from last year's Cyber Monday record of $1billion

Despite a stubbornly sluggish economy,
 comScore is reporting positive news for e-commerce and predicts a 15 
per cent growth for U.S. holiday spending this year.

Retailers are hoping to integrate 
Black Friday shopping with Cyber Monday deals. ‘We’re really starting to
 ingrain this as the ‘next big shopping day,’’ IBM’s John Squire told 
CNN.

Vendors took to social media as well, promoting online shopping deals with the hashtag #CyberMonday.

Cyber Monday is usually a hit with office workers who shop for bargains while at work. About half of today's sales are expected to be from shoppers at work, the Los Angeles Times says.

Amazon's offers included a discounted

offer was scheduled to end Monday.

Walmart expanded its Cyber Week offerings with more than 250 online-only specials, with savings of up to 40 per cent.

Walmart also offered free shipping on orders of $45 or more.

Even high-end stores like Saks Fifth Avenue jumped on the Cyber Monday bandwagon, offering up 
to 40 per cent off its online inventory.

ComScore reported online sales for 
Black Friday two days after researcher Coremetrics reported a smaller 
online spending gain for Black Friday.

Coremetrics reported a 20 per cent increase, compared with comScore's 26 per cent.

Gian Fulgoni, comScore chairman, said 
e-commerce enjoyed a banner day, despite some analysts' predictions that
 early store openings on Black Friday could hurt online sales.

Mr Fulgoni said: 'With 
brick-and-mortar retail also reporting strong gains on Black Friday, 
it's clear that the heavy promotional activity had a positive impact on 
both channels.'
