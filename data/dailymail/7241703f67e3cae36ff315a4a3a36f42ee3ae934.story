In 2001, then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Bernard Kerik was like a brother to him, at the police commissioner's NYPD retirement ceremony. 

But just five years later, as he was accused of ethics violations and conspiracy charges, Kerik learned that Giuliani's friendship was anything but as strong as blood. 

In his new memoir From Jailer to Jailed, due out Tuesday and excerpted in the New York Daily News, Kerik details his fall from grace and how Giuliani cut ties not only with him, but with his wife and daughters - one of whom is Giuliani's goddaughter.

From friends to strangers: Disgraced for New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik says ex-NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani abandoned him and his family once he was hit with legal woes in the mid-2000s.

Abandoning his own goddaughter: Kerik says Giuliani completely cut ties not only with him but with his family, including his daughter Celine who is Giuliani's goddaughter.

When the first accusations against Kerik were lodged in 2006, his old pal Giuliani was gearing up for the 2008 presidential election and the two appeared to still be close. 

But in June of that year, Kerik went from being a 9/11 hero to a corrupt city official on the cover of tabloids when the Bronx District Attorney's Office hit him with two ethics code violations - one for not disclosing a personal loan on his conflict-of-interest report and the other for accepting renovations on his home from a New Jersey company vying for city work. 

It was in November that Kerik first started to feel the cold shoulder from the Giuliani camp.

Kerik says he was sitting in his office one day when his then 6-year-old daughter Celine came in and asked to send her godfather a present - one befitting a possible future president of the United States. 

'Given that my daughter Celine was only six years old at the time, she had no idea of the difference between a Democrat and a Republican. All she knew was that people were saying that her godfather was going to be the next president of the United States. 

Disgraced: Kerik was sent to prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to felony tax and false statement charges. Pictured above at a press conference in November 2007 

'She was talking about it twenty-four hours a day, as if that were the only thing going on in her little world. She had no idea of what this really meant, of course, but she was convinced that Rudy was going to be president,' Kerik writes. 

Remembering a previous visit to the White House to meet President George W Bush, Celine asked to give her godfather a Bronco Buster statue - just like the one she saw in Oval Office during her visit. 

The two picked out a statuette and sent it to Giuliani with a handmade card from Celine ahead of Kerik's out-of-town trip to London. 

By the time he returned though, Kerik was having a hard time getting in contact with Giuliani. 

Kerik had promised his daughter that they could see her godfather during their annual holiday-time stay in New York City and when Giuliani didn't return his calls, Kerik 'didn't have the hard to tell Celine'. 

Kerik fully got the message when soon after he found a box containing the statue returned to his front step. 

'I just didn’t understand it. What bothered me more than anything was that whoever sent it back took the girls’ card and didn’t have the courtesy to send a note back with the box,' Kerik recalls. 

What's more - Giuliani failed to send his daughters birthday or Christmas cards like he did every year - and they haven't received one since. 

The next year, Kerik was hit with even more allegations - this time for conspiracy, tax fraud and making false statements during his Department of Homeland Security appointment. 

In 2009, he pleaded guilty to eight felony tax and false statement charges and was sent to the minimum-security prison camp in Cumberland, Maryland on May 17, 2010 - where he spent the next nearly three years. 

Kerik says what bothers him most about his sudden estrangement from Giuliani, is the fact that the former NYC mayor abandoned his wife and daughter when they needed his support the most. 

' During my time in Cumberland, Rudy never once called Hala [Kerik's wife] to speak with the girls. He never tried calling any mutual friend of ours to check up on them, ask how they were doing. There were no Christmas or birthday cards. 

'My safe guess is that as a former U.S. attorney Rudy had a sense of what the separation of incarceration does to families — yet not once did he call to help in any way,' Kerik writes.  

Before he was jailed, Kerik  held positions as the corrections commissioner of New York City, New York City police commissioner and interim Iraqi minister of the interior. 

Giuliani ran as a Republican in the 2008 presidential primary but lost the party nomination to Arizona Senator John McCain.
