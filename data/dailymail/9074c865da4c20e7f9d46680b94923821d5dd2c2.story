Jason Robinson admits that Wigan's World Cup Challenge victory in Brisbane 21 years ago took his own reputation to the next level. Now he believes the current crop of Super League stars can do the same this weekend.

Robinson was only 19 when his solo try helped Wigan to a 20-14 victory in front of 54,000 people at Lang Park – now the ANZ Stadium - in 1994. One of the Australian commentators suggested at the time: 'They will make him the Mayor of Wigan after that'.

Looking back this week, the former Wigan winger said: 'It's true that my reputation and standing in the game was different because of that match. If you can perform in a match like that then it immediately earns you respect.

Robinson was a huge hit in union and scored a superb try in England's 2003 World Cup final triumph 

'It was an incredible occasion back then, one of the highlights of my career. The fact that we won, did wonders for me and for the game over here.'

This year's World Club Challenge is being played as a series. Super League winners St Helens face NRL champions South Sydney Rabbitohs at Langtree Park on Sunday but, prior to that, on Friday night and Saturday, Warrington Wolves face St George-Illawarra and Wigan Warriors entertain Brisbane Broncos once again.

The new concept has attracted some scepticism but Robinson believes the three games offer the English game the opportunity to prove a point.

'This weekend is so important,' he added.

'Three games between some of the biggest clubs in the game. What's not to like about it? This is an enormous opportunity for Super League.

'Being a top player in Super League does not mean you are a big player in the world. But if you can put on a good show in games like this – especially if you win – than that changes.

'Will Brisbane fear Wigan, for example? No, they won't.

'But Wigan can give them a big surprise just like we did 20 years ago. That then begins to change things doesn't it?

'This is the opportunity for current Wigan players – and players at Warrington and St Helens – to write their own little bit of history.

'It would mean an awful lot to our game if we could do well this weekend. It generates immediate respect overseas.

'When you hear people talk, they all say that the NRL is the ultimate league. Maybe we can show them this weekend that the gulf isn't that big after all.

'As a player, in order to grow you have to be taken out of your comfort zone. Our teams will prepare this week maybe with a bit of fear factor. They will know they could get a hiding.

'But they also know they have a chance to come out the other side with their reputations enhanced. That is the one of the motivational factors for them.

'Personally, I think something good could happen for them this weekend. Rugby in this country will find out exactly where it stands this weekend and I am optimistic.'

Robinson played more than 300 times for Wigan before switching to Rugby Union. He won a Union World Cup in 2003 with England but still rates the 1994 World Club success as one of his career highlights.

Also in the Wigan team that night were legends such as Andy Farrell, Martin Offiah and Shaun Edwards. Current SKY analyst Phil Clarke and Widnes Vikings coach Denis Betts also played.

On Saturday at the DW Stadium, Robinson will be present with many of his team-mates from that night in Brisbane to see if Shaun Wane's current side can repeat the triumph.

'Back then, to even go to Australia at the age of 19 was quite a big thing for me,' he recalled.

'But playing in that stadium, the pressure that we were under, the difficult style of play, that all added to the occasion. It was incredible.

'It was funny really because when we got there, we were immediately told to kick back a bit and take it easy. So we had a couple of nights out and maybe we let our hair down a bit too much!

'But then the reality kicked in. We were a good team and had just had a great year at home.

'But this was still a huge test for us. They could have taken us to the cleaners and we knew it.

'That threat was always there. The Australians had always set the levels.

'The players they had in their team were exceptional. Wendell Sailor, Glenn Lazarus, Andrew Gee, for example. These guys were serious players.

'But they key to it was the fact we knew – we believed – we had great players too. We went out there with that attitude and that was really important.

Wigan will be without skipper Sean O'Loughlin (centre) for their clash against the Brisbane Broncos 

'We started well and got on the front foot and that was so important. We set our levels high in that game right from the start.

'I was lucky enough to score a try in the game and, for me, that was amazing.

'It's nearly 21 years ago but the memories are still there. They are still fresh. It remains a career highlight for me.'

This weekend Wigan will be without skipper Sean O'Loughlin, who has a knee injury. Wigan also have the memories of a disappointing defeat in their corresponding game against Sydney Roosters in Australia a year ago to contend with.

'That will have hurt Wigan a lot,' said Robinson, whose 20-year-old son Lewis Tierney is on Wigan's books.

'But Shaun Wane will have them fired up for this, no doubt about that.

'Missing O'Loughlin is big for Wigan but they have Dan Sarginson back so that's a boost for them.

'Lewis has his head down and is working hard. He has not played many games but that's because the standard is so high.

'Wigan have a lot of very good young players. It's tough to get in that team.'
