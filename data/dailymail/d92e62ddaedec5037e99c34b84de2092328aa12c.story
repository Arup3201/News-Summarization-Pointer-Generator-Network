A Chinese woman's attempt to visit her parents to show off her new car failed miserably after she mixed up the accelerator and brake pedal while parking – and demolished not just her car but part of her parents' house as well.

Ye Chia, 29, who had passed her test last December, had not bothered to drive again until buying a brand new car this summer and packing in her husband and two daughters, aged seven and three, for a trip back home to see her parents.

The trip to the house in Gaoli village in the city of Wenzhou in east China’s Zhejiang province had gone well, until the proud daughter drove into the front garden where instead of using the brake, in her excitement at being home again she pressed the accelerator.

Wrecked: A Chinese woman drove her brand new car into her parents' house 

Mistake: It's thought that the woman accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake

As a result the car drove at high speed into the house.

She told local TV: 'I felt the impact of the car hitting the house and the airbags went off, then I heard a cracking sound and tons of rubble fell on the car as well. I thought we were going to die.'

The woman's mother Jun Hsiao, 56, said: 'I know that it's a disaster that the house and the car were destroyed, but we are only happy that our daughter and family got out unharmed.'

Proud: The daughter had wanted to show off her new car, but ended up ruining it

Collapse: The rooms that had been destroyed were bedrooms belonging to the woman's mother and brother

Police spokesman On Chang said: 'The house was 40 years old and was not in the best condition but probably would have been good for a few more years if it hadn't been hit at speed by the car. The accident was caused by the woman's driving skills – after passing her test she hadn't bothered to practice again and got confused presumably in the excitement of arriving home. Fortunately nobody was in the house when it collapsed, so nobody was hurt.'

He said that the accident happened in the late afternoon, and the rooms that had been destroyed were bedrooms belonging to the woman's mother and brother.

Ye Chia is reportedly now arguing with the insurance company after they refused to provide her with a replacement hire car for the return journey.
