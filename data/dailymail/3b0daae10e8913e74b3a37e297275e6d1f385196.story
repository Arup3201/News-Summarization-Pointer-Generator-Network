On a day of drama and ultimate delight for Scotland’s rugby sevens team, they kept their hopes of a Commonwealth Games medal alive after qualifying from their group.

A controversial 17-14 opening defeat to New Zealand, who were reduced to five men after two yellow cards, was followed by an easy 56-0 win over Barbados which meant it all came down to their final group match against Canada.

Only a win would do to qualify and Scotland, roared on by a crowd of over 50,000 in the evening session, which equalled the morning attendance, didn’t disappoint running out 21-5 winners.

They will return to Ibrox today to play in front of a total audience of around 100,000 for the knock-out stages of the tournament hoping to pick up Scotland’s first ever rugby sevens medal.

They started their campaign with a spirited loss to the current Commonwealth Games champions New Zealand who were given a scare in a match that ended in real ill-feeling.

The All Blacks started superbly, racing to a 17-0 half-time lead but in the second half Scotland rallied, roared on by the home crowd.

Two New Zealanders picked up yellow cards for denying Scotland try-scoring opportunities that had the home fans booing them for their poor sportsmanship.

With a two-man advantage Scotland slowly cut the deficit and two converted tries from Lee Jones set up a thrilling finish.

With the Kiwis panicking, there was confusion on their bench which led to Tim Mikkleson, the second New Zealander to be yellow-carded, returning to the field around 10 seconds before his two minutes in the sin-bin was over.

That was illegal and, because of that, there were grounds for appeal by Scotland. After thinking about it, Scotland coach Stevie Gemmell saved referee Marius van der Westhuizen’s blushes by refusing to make an issue of his mistake.

‘An error was made that had no direct impact on the outcome,’ said Gemmell. ‘Just as we look at our errors, all referees analyse their performances.’

Scotland’s try scorer Jones was a bit more forthright, accusing New Zealand of using every trick in the book to stop them winning.

‘After giving them a 17-point halftime lead it was always going to be tough but we came back at them.

But they managed to break down a couple of our attacks that could have led to tries,’ said Jones.

‘Playing for Scotland in a stadium like this is phenomenal — our target is to medal and we ran New Zealand, who are the current champions, close so that is a very good sign.’

Scotland’s second match was easier as they strolled to a 56-0 win over whipping boys Barbados.

In an eight-try romp in the rain they set up the winners-take-all match in emphatic style with two tries from Jones and others from Mark Bennett, Scott Wight, Sean Lamont, James Johnstone, Stuart Hogg and Colin Shaw.

Man of the match Lamont believes their performances at the group stages showed they have the ability to secure a medal.

‘This squad is showing they can be contenders,’ he said. ‘We are playing good sevens rugby and we can’t wait for the rest of the tournament.’

In the final match of the day, Scotland went in 14-5 ahead at half-time thanks to tries from Jones and Richie Vernon which were converted by Colin Gregor.

The only reply from Canada was a try from Michael Fuailefau.

In the second half Scotland sealed the match with a try from Bennet converted again by Gregor.

Although Scotland were given the biggest cheers, the home crowd embraced the tournament with massive crowds at both sessions.
