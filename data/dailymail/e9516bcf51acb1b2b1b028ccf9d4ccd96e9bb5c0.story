Furious: Nigel Stern with the letter purporting to be from his missing cat Minx

Police officers are investigating after a thief stole a three-legged cat and wrote a letter taunting the animal's owner - boasting of how she loves her new home.

Nigel Stern spent weeks searching for his beloved companion Minx after she vanished from his home in Lostwithiel, Cornwall.

The 52-year-old covered walls in his neighbourhood with posters appealing for his pet's return but heard nothing until the typed letter was sent to a local antiques shop and florist.

The note, purporting to be from the missing moggy, thanked locals for their concern but told them she was happy with her new life in the countryside.

It said: 'I made friends with two very nice people who live in the country and when they invited me to come and live with them I said "yes please".

'I am well, very happy, love living in the countryside and can run up and down the stairs really fast now.

'I follow my friends into the bathroom, watch them shower, bounce on their bed and help type things on their computer.

'I miss you all, especially my Dad. Please let him know I am OK.'

The letter - signed Little Three Legs xxxx - was immediately passed on to devastated Mr Stern who contacted the police.

He said the initial sense of relief he felt knowing his treasured pet is still alive, quickly turned to anger.

Branding the letter 'sick', Mr Stern said: 'When I read the contents my relief quickly turned to anger. They must know it's my cat, she's so well known around town.

'She's a very independent, sociable cat that wanders around every day. Whoever did this is sick. Minx is my only companion.

Kidnapped: Missing Minx disappeared from her Cornwall home in September. The 'thief' responsible for her disappearance sent the letter taunting Mr Stern, telling him she 'loves her new life'

Desperate: Mr Stern put up posters appealing for help to find three-year-old Minx, his 'only companion'. He said his initial relief at knowing she is alive quickly turned to anger as he branded the letter 'sick'

'I
guess they didn't have the guts to post this letter through my door 
directly because they were worried I would have caught them.

To all my good friends in Lostwithiel.Thank you so much for taking care of me when I lived in Lostwithiel.I liked living in the town and visiting you all. You were so kind and fed me all sorts of treats. I had a bed in lots of the shops and houses.I made friends with two very nice people who live in the countryside and when they invited me to go and live with them I said 'yes please'.

Even though I didn't show it. I became a little frightened and nervous after my accident and Lostwithiel suddenly seemed a very busy place to me.I am well, very happy, love living in the countryside and can run up and down the stairs really fast now.

I follow my friends into the bathroom, watch them shower, bounce on their bed and help type things on the computer.I miss you all, especially my Dad. Please let him know I am ok.Lots and lots of love to everyone.Little Three Legs xxxx

'Minx hates being separated from me so there is no way she's happy. I can imagine she's very distressed.

'She's just been through the trauma of losing a leg and now she's been stolen. I just want her back safe and well.'

Unmarried Mr Stern said for the last three years Minx, who was six months old when he picked her up has been his 'only companion'.

She
lost her leg in August when he found her lying injured beside the road.

Vets weren't able to say what caused the wounds but said it was likely 
the cat's limb was crushed.

Minx had the leg amputated but was otherwise making a full recovery when she vanished weeks later.

The well-known feline was even made an honorary member of the Lostwithiel Social Committee after Mr Stern took her along to meetings.

Officers are yet to establish whether it was a genuine theft, a prank - or both.

But kitchen porter Mr Stern is convinced the black and white cat, who disappeared on September 8, was stolen.

He said: 'When I saw the letter my blood was boiling with anger; it's disgusting.

'Whoever took her knows who I am because the letter says, "I miss you all, especially my dad; please let him know I'm OK".

'She's a right little character around the town and everybody knows her. She was really happy where she was and had lots of friends.

'She was like a dog in the sense that she wagged her tail when she was happy. I miss her and just want her back.

'Whoever did it is probably keeping her locked in and she hates to be kept inside. I've asked window cleaners and postmen to keep an eye out as well.'

PC Andrew Barnicoat of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'It's obviously a very upsetting case and we're just looking to reunite the cat with its owner, so all information would be welcome.'
