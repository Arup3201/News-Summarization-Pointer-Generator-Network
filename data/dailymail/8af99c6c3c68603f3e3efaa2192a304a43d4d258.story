A man has appeared in court today charged with the murder of his neighbour who was stabbed to death on her way to work.

Trevor Gibbon, 48, of Harrow, north west London, was remanded in custody when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates' Court this morning.

He is accused of killing his neighbour, Alison Morrison, who died half a mile from her Harrow home as she made her way to work on Thursday morning.

Residents reported hearing piercing screams and police were called to the attack in Alexandra Avenue at 7.47am.

Mrs Morrison was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died from her injuries. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple stab wounds.

Gibbon, satellite TV engineer, held on to glass at the front of the dock and looked around the court during today's brief hearing.

Magistrate Caroline Whycer told him he was being remanded in custody to stand trial at the Old Bailey, where there will be a bail hearing on Tuesday, followed by a preliminary hearing on January 12.

Tributes have been pouring in for Mrs Morrision, who has been described as a 'wonderful and caring' mother and wife who worked hard to reduce crime in her community.

Her three sisters, Julie, Paula and Lorraine, have left from their homes in Waterlooville, Hampshire, to comfort her grieving husband Cedric and their 16-year-old son Kori in Harrow.

Her sister Julie had been due to stay at their £410,000 end-of-terrace house after visiting the Olympia Horse Show in London this weekend.

Mrs Morrison, a mother of one, grew up in Bedhampton, Hampshire, before moving to the capital after finishing university.

She was planning to return home to see her family to celebrate Christmas next week.

Her brother-in-law, Lee Richards, said her 46-year-old husband called the family to tell them the tragic news.

He said: 'We are in shock. It couldn't have happened to a nicer lady.

'You know what sisters are like - you can't separate them.

'They received a phone call from Cedric to say there had been a situation.

'They left what they were doing and went straight up there.'

Mrs Morrison's sister Paula received the news after stepping off the plane at London Heathrow airport following a 10-day holiday in Cuba.

Mr Richards said his wife Julie Brathwaite, a 52-year-old mother-of-two who runs a cleaning business, was inconsolable.

He said: 'She's in a mess. I have left the sisters together - that's the best way.

'Alison was here a couple of weeks ago. My family were due to go up this weekend to the Olympia horse show.

'They were going to stay at Alison's home.

'A couple of years ago they lost their dad.

'It's taken them this long to get over that and now this has happened.'

Her mother, Valerie Brathwaite, who still lives in the family home in Hampshire was too upset to speak yesterday.

But Mr Richards described Mrs Morrison as a 'wonderful, caring mother' to her teenage son Kori.

He said she died a lot of voluntary work for her community, and was the vice-chairwoman of her local Neighbourhood Watch scheme.

Tributes for the 'wonderful and caring' mother of one have been left at the scene of her death in Harrow

One tribute left at the scene, from one of her sisters, said: 'I'm so sorry you've been taken away from us all'

Her full-time job was as a senior manager at consumer organisation Which?, a position she moved to London for after studying a degree.

He said: 'She was fun-loving and happy. She was sensible and responsible - this is a disaster.'

Bianca Brathwaite, 24, Mrs Morrison's niece, added: 'She was everything you could ask for in a woman, she was strong and always stood up for herself and her family and is loved dearly.'

David Perry, leader of Harrow Council, described her as a 'key member of the board'.

He said: 'Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a community champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about.

'Alison's colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news, as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the board and a tireless advocate of its work.

'We will do whatever we can to help the police. In the meantime, our thoughts are with Alison's family.'

Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens, borough commander for Harrow, said: 'I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Alison in her role as the vice-chair of our borough's Safer Neighbourhood Board.

'She was held in high regard locally, and truly cared about the borough. Her friends within the local community will be devastated by her loss.'
