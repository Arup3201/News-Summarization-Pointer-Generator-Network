Everton could yet face action from the Football Association after a supporter appeared to shine a laser towards the eye of Stoke City’s Bojan Krkic during the Boxing Day defeat at Goodison Park.

Images emerged after the match that demonstrated a green light hovering over the Stoke forward’s eye as he stepped up to score the penalty kick that secured the three points for Mark Hughes’ side.

It is understood that the player was not aware of the light at the time and didn't appear to be distracted as he put the ball beyond Tim Howard into the bottom left corner.

Everton’s fate will be decided by the match report written by referee Lee Mason.

If Mason includes the information in his account, then the FA are highly likely to open an investigation. 

If he does not, then it will remain a club issue for Everton to look into internally.

The penalty was already a controversial one for Everton, with the Toffees players protesting to referee Lee Mason that Spaniard Bojan went down too easily under the challenge of James McCarthy. 

Everton's Boxing Day loss was their second in a row and the 3-2 defeat by Newcastle on Sunday made it three as they slipped four points behind 11th-placed Stoke, who beat West Brom.
