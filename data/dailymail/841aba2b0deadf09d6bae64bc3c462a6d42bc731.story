Carl Peterson, a level 3 sex offender, stood up before a crowd of 100 people at Belmont High School on Thursday and stated, ‘ My name is Carl Peterson. I'm the level 3 sex offender all of you have been talking about’

The 48-year-old moved to Bernard Road in Belmont,Ma. In late July and resides with his wife and his 14-year-old daughter. Peterson was jailed 12 years ago for the rape against his 14-year-old niece.

The Belmont Patch gave a detailed report of the meeting on Thursday.

The meeting organized by the Belmont Police Department to inform the public about the sexual offenders registry and safety concerns, became a heated discussion between Peterson and the crowd of worried residents.

‘It seems as though the big reason why we are here tonight is me,’ said Peterson who previously resided in Lexington, Ma.

‘The problem is all you know, all you get to know about my problem is what you read ... which says I'm the most dangerous and the most likely to re-offend of all sex offenders. It also says my offense was the rape against a child,’ said Peterson who was surrounded by law enforcement.

A woman cried, ‘I don’t want to hear this.' Another exclaimed,  ‘just go.’ One resident said,'You were charged with rape.'

Despite the crowd’s concerns, one community member stated, ‘Whoever is uncomfortable, we respect that. But we are being told that we need to be knowledgeable to protect our children.’ She said it was important to listen to what Peterson had to say.

'One of the scariest things while spending time in prison was wondering ... that it will not happen again," said Peterson. 'At this point, I know that it will never happen again'

Peterson has been in therapy for 8 years with Dr. Carol Ball a licensed psychologist in Arlington and a founder of New England Forensic Associates.

Peterson has also agreed to meet with Belmont High School Principal Dr. Dan Richards and his church's pastor (another long-time educator, former Watertown High Head Master Steve Watson) on 'the kind of things that scare people' about him.

Peterson said he was open to answering any questions people may have about the incident that occurred, 'over a weekend 12 years ago.'

"My crime was not against pre-school children or somebody I didn't know or lots of lots of children. It was against my niece," said Peterson.

Peterson says that he and his wife fear for the safety of their own daughter and intend no harm.

'I'm a parent. I have a 14-year-old daughter. On the first day of school, a white SUV showed up and approached a child. I'm a level 3 sex offender; it scared me to death. We talked about this to our daughter. I talked to this about my wife. What happened is the kid did not get picked up. He knew exactly what to do. The kid said 'This is not OK' and went away and told the police. There's not much else [parents] can do except [talk to them]," Peterson said.

After Peterson shared his words, a community member went up to him, shook his hand and thanked him for being 'brave.'
