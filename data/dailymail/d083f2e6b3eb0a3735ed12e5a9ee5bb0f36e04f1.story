Juventus striker Alvaro Morata has slammed Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti for leaving him on the bench without an explanation last season.

The Spaniard left Madrid last summer and joined Serie A champions Juventus in search of first team football, where he has scored seven goals in 22 appearances.

Speaking of his last few months in Madrid, Morata told Onda Cero: 'I do not understand what happened – I went from playing well to being sat on the bench. 

Alvaro Morata has claimed he had 'barely any relationship' with Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti

'I wasn't asking to be in every starting line-up, but I wanted better treatment.

'I barely had any relationship with Ancelotti. Massimiliano Allegri, for better or worse, is very aware of my presence within the squad.'

Morata, who is currently on international duty with Spain, is also hoping to take advantage of Diego Costa's absence from national squad.

Costa was forced to pull out of the squad after picking up a hamstring injury during Chelsea's 3-2 victory against Hull last Sunday.

'I will have to work very hard to get any playing time,' he told a news conference at Spain's training base outside Madrid on Tuesday.

'There are a lot of people who are in great shape and it will be tough to get into the side but I will give my all,' he added.

'I am playing well for my team. I am very happy with my season and I am coming here to enjoy myself, to try to perform and to learn.'

With four matches played, Spain are second in Euro 2016 qualification Group C on nine points, three behind leaders Slovakia, who beat them 2-1 in Zilina in October, and level with Ukraine.
