Jose Mourinho is confident he has captured Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona to replace Frank Lampard at Chelsea and is hoping a deal can be announced before Spain face Holland in their opening World Cup game on Friday.

He is convinced that Fabregas and Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa are both bound for Stamford Bridge this summer, as the Chelsea manager looks to spice up his attack ahead of a title challenge next season.

The Blues finished third in the Premier League last season, just four points behind winners Manchester City, despite Mourinho repeatedly claiming they were not title challengers.

It is hoped the signings of Fabregas and Costa, for £28million and £32m respectively, will help them win their first league title since the 2009-10 season. 

Despite Arsenal having a buy-back option on Fabregas, Arsene Wenger withdrew the Gunners from the race to sign the Barcelona midfielder, clearing the way for Chelsea.

The midfielder, 27, who qualifies as a homegrown player in the Premier League after spending eight years at Arsenal, expressed an interest in moving back to England after just three years in Spain, having being told he could leave the Nou Camp.

And Spain and Barcelona team-mate Gerard Pique appeared to confirm Fabregas’ move to Chelsea during a conversation with Spain boss Vicente del Bosque at a promotional event last week.

'Despite excitement surrounding Fabregas’ move, one Chelsea season-ticket holder of 40 years has described the signing as ‘the equivalent of hiring Rafa Benitez as manager’.'

The defender told Del Bosque: ‘He [Cesc] told me it’s all done. He’s going, €33m he told me.’

Fabregas' partner Daniella Semaan then posted an Instagram message with a picture of her and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi's partner Antonella Roccuzzo, saying: 'I miss this girl so so so so much' before using the hashtag #tevoyaextranar, translated as 'I'll miss you'.

Chelsea’s interest in Costa, meanwhile, has been long-standing, with the Brazil-born striker excelling for Atletico during a campaign that saw them beat Barcelona and Real Madrid to win La Liga, and finish runners-up in the Champions League after seeing off Mourinho's side in the semi-final.

Sportsmail revealed on Thursday how everything was in place for the 25-year-old to complete his move, with a fee and personal terms agreed.

A hamstring injury that blighted the end of his domestic season had delayed a medical, but a return to fitness has enabled him to complete that ahead of the World Cup.

And Costa took another step closer to joining Chelsea following a cameo performance for Spain against El Salvador on Saturday night.

Speaking after Spain's 2-0 friendly win, he told AS: 'Am I going to Chelsea? It looks like it.'
