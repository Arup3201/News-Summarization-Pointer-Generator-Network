The Mars bar is getting a slimmer sister with 20 per cent fewer calories.

The Mars Caramel, which does not have the original's thick layer of nougat, has already been a success in the US, Canada and Australia and will be available here next month.

It weighs 45g and contains 204 calories, compared with a regular Mars bar weighing 58g with 260 calories.

The introduction of the smaller caramel bar is expected to be followed by slimmed down versions of the traditional Mars and the company's other big brands, which include Snickers, Galaxy, Maltesers, Bounty, Twix and Topic.

The measures are part of a so-called Responsibility Deal Pledge where the company has promised that all its chocolate snacks will be cut to less than 250 calories by the end of 2013.

For some this will involve a change in the recipe by, for example, cutting the amount of fat, however in most cases it will mean smaller bars.

The company said Mars Caramel has already enjoyed success in the U.S., Canada and Australia, and would tap into growing consumer preference for caramel - now one of the top three flavours in the chocolate category.

In June, Mars UK managing director Fiona Dawson said reformulation might not be enough to hit the 250 calorie target and that some bars would have to shrink.

She told the trade magazine The Grocer: 'We're looking at the options and experimenting with a number of different sizes with customer groups.'

Chocolate maker Mars is planning to slim down famous brands like Mars, Snickers and Maltesers

Consumers may well question the health claims given by Mars for cutting the size of the bars. Historically, chocolate manufacturers have a record of shrinking their products without delivering a matching cut in price.

As a result, customers get less for their money, while the manufacturers are able to protect their profit margins.

The UK arm of the company cut the size of the Mars and Snickers bars by 7.5 per cent in 2009, bringing them down from 62.5g to 58g. However, there was no cut in price.

In 2010 the makers of the iconic Mars chocolate bar rejigged the recipe to contain 15 per cent less saturated fat following pressure from the Food Standards Agency to cut fat levels.

The healthier bars now contain less saturated palm fat than the old recipe after it was replaced by healthier sunflower oil.

Mars said the change will remove more than 600 tons of saturated fat a year from the UK diet - equalling seven million bags of sugar.

Snickers, Milky Way and Topic bars were also altered, and the company assured consumers that they would not notice any difference in the taste of the product.

A spokesman said: 'We believe that all of our products can be enjoyed as part of a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet - our commitment to making all our chocolate products no more than 250 calories per portion reflects this.

'These changes form part of our on-going efforts to encourage responsible consumption, and will come into effect globally by the end of next year.'

One of Mars biggest rivals, Cadbury, which is now part of the U.S. confectionary giant Kraft, has cut the size of a number of its products in recent years.

However, it has admitted this has been a financial decision, rather than any effort to tackle obesity.

Last year, it reduced the size of the 140g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk to 120g, so losing the equivalent of two chunks.

It then cut the size of its traditional circular Roses tins from 975g to 850g â€“ effectively snatching away 11 of the chocolate favourites.

At the time, the company blamed increases in the cost of commodities, such as cocoa.

Consumer groups have been sceptical about cuts in portion sizes on the pretext of supporting healthy living.

Which? and the official customer body Consumer Focus argue that firms should be up-front about any decision to shrink products and to match any reductions with a cut in the price.

Consumer Focus said: 'As a tactic, shrinking size but not price won't go down well among savvy customers who may become inclined to be less loyal to their favourite brands.'
