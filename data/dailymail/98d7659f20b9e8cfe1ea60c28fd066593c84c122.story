Savings: For the first time, more than half the country is now shopping at a discount retailer such as  Aldi or Lidl as the nation economises ahead of Christmas

If you have been searching for ways to save cash on your supermarket shopping, it seems you’re not alone.

For the first time, more than half the country is now shopping at a discount retailer such as Aldi or Lidl as the nation economises ahead of Christmas.

Some 50.1 per cent of us have bought groceries from one or both of the stores on at least one occasion in the past 12 weeks.

And the market share of these budget retailers is rising at the same time as the big four – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – are losing customers.

Aldi and Lidl’s success comes on the back of their concerted effort to target middle Britain with high-quality food, wine and spirits at discount prices.

Their efforts have been boosted by a clutch of awards in blind taste tests, which have seen budget options outdo products from high-end retailers such as Fortnum & Mason and Harrods.

The latest figures were compiled by analysts Kantar Worldpanel and cover the 12 weeks up to December 8.

Their report said: ‘Some 50.1 per cent of all British households stepped into a discount retailer compared with 46.1 per cent a year ago.’

Their analysis also revealed that Aldi’s sales are up by 30.6 per cent in a year, taking its national market share up 
from 3.2per cent to 4per cent. 

Sales at Lidl are up 15.5per cent, so 
increasing its market share from 2.8per cent to 3.1per cent.

By
 contrast, Tesco’s share of grocery sales is down from 30.6per cent to 
29.9per cent; Asda from 17.3per cent to 16.9per cent; Sainsbury’s from 
17per cent to 16.8per cent; and Morrisons from 11.9per cent to 11.6per 
cent.

Kantar’s Chris 
Longbottom said: ‘Both Aldi and Lidl have continued to record 
double-digit growth and are successfully broadening their shopper base 
with half of all British households visiting one of them during the 
latest period.’

At the 
other end of the market, Waitrose posted an annual sales growth of 
6.7per cent.

Mr Longbottom said: ‘Based on past patterns, it is likely to
 further boost its market share over the busy Christmas period, as is 
Iceland which traditionally performs well with its party food offering.'
