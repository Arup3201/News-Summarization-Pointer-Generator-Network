The number of executions carried out last year around the globe rose by 15 per cent with the increase down to 'killing sprees' in Iraq and Iran, according to Amnesty International.

Amnesty said there had been a 'sharp global spike' in the number of executions carried out in 2013, with almost 100 more people put to death than in the previous year.

Excluding China - where figures are a
 state secret - at least 778 executions were known to have been carried 
out in 2013, compared to 682 in 2012, a jump of 96, or nearly 15 per cent.

The
 figures were revealed today as Amnesty published its annual review of 
the death penalty worldwide, with the numbers of executions in Iran, 
where at least 369 people were put to death, and Iraq (169) were significantly higher than in 2012.

Saudi Arabia (79), the USA (39) and Somalia (34) also saw large numbers of people executed through the year.

In
 total, prisoners were executed in 22 countries in 2013, one more than 
in 2012, and Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria and Vietnam all resumed 
executions as a form of punishment.

Meanwhile, at least 1,927 people were 
known to have been sentenced to death in 57 countries in 2013, up from 
1,722 death sentences in 58 countries in 2012. This means that the 
global figure for people on death row stood at a minimum of 23,394 by 
the end of last year.

Methods of executions included 
beheading, electrocution, firing squad, hanging and lethal injection - 
with public executions taking place in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia 
and Somalia.

In 
addition to murder, individuals faced the death penalty for non-lethal 
crimes such as robbery, drugs offences and embezzlement, while in Gaza, 'collaboration with Israel' was punishable by death.

People also faced execution for the 
supposed 'offences' of adultery, sodomy, blasphemy, pornography, and, in
 North Korea, watching banned videos from South Korea.

Meanwhile, many countries used vaguely-worded political 'crimes' to put real or perceived dissidents to death.

'The killing sprees we saw in countries like Iran and Iraq were shameful,' said Amnesty International’s secretary general Salil Shetty.

'Only a small number of countries carried out the vast majority of these senseless state-sponsored killings.

'The
 long-term trend is clear - the death penalty is becoming a thing of the
 past. We urge all governments who still kill in the name of justice to 
impose a moratorium on the death penalty immediately, with a view to 
abolishing it.'

The new figures were released just days after more than 500 people were sentenced to death in Egypt.

On Monday 529 supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi were sentenced to death in a ruling by an Egyptian court.

The
 group, members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, were convicted of a 
number of charges, including killing a police officer and attempting to 
murder others and were sentenced by a court in Minya, south of the 
capital, Cairo.

The ruling is a sharp escalation of Egypt’s crackdown on supporters of Morsi, which has seen thousands arrested and hundreds killed so far.

The charity says that more than 109 death sentences were handed down in Egypt in 2013, although it was unable to confirm if judicial executions had taken place in the country during 2013.

'Little or no information was available in some countries - in particular Egypt, Eritrea, Malaysia, North Korea and Syria, due to restrictive state practice and/or political instability,' said the report.

'It is possible that judicial executions did in fact take place in Syria, but none could be confirmed for the present report.'

The
 charity says that the use of the death penalty by military and special 
courts and tribunals in Egypt, as well as in country's including the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, 
Palestinian Authority, and Somalia were of 'continuing concern'.

However, Amnesty said that despite the increase in the number executions, there has been a decline in the number of countries using the death penalty over the last 20 years.

Two decades ago, 37 countries carried out executions, compared to last year’s 22. Many countries who had carried out executions in 2012 did not implement death sentences last year - including Gambia, the UAE and Pakistan.

Belarus also refrained from carrying out executions, meaning Europe and Central Asia were execution-free for the first time since 2009.

At least 369 executions were officially acknowledged in Iran by the authorities, although Amnesty sources believe hundreds more took place in secret, bringing the actual total to more than 700.

In Iraq 
there was a stark rise in executions for the third year running, and the
 169 executions was an increase of almost one-third on the previous 
year, with the vast majority of those killed convicted under vague 
anti-terrorism laws.

Saudi Arabia’s 79 executions remained at the same 
high levels as the previous two years, although for the first time in 
three years Saudi Arabia executed three juvenile offenders, in breach of
 international law.

No-one was executed in the UAE for the first time in three 
years, and executions dropped in Yemen for the second year running.

Iran

During
 one weekend in October last year, the Iranian authorities carried out
 20 executions, including of the Kurdish political prisoner Habibollah 
Golparipour.

Golparipour was arrested in 2009 and sentenced to 
death in a five-minute trial in 2010 for 'enmity against God' through his alleged cooperation with a banned armed group, 
the 'Party For Free Life of Kurdistan'.

His family was not notified of 
his execution beforehand, and after his execution the authorities 
reportedly refused to hand over his body.

Africa

In
 Sub-Saharan Africa five countries carried out executions: Botswana, 
Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan, with reported executions in 
Somalia jumping from six in 2012 to at least 34 last year.

In Nigeria, 
four men were hanged in the country’s first executions in seven years, 
following statements from President Goodluck Jonathan which gave a green
 light to a resumption of executions in Nigeria.

Across the 
region, several countries - including Benin, Ghana and Sierra Leone - 
took significant steps towards ending the death penalty, either through 
reviewing constitutions or proposing amendments to penal codes.

Americas

The USA was the only country in the Americas to 
carry out executions, although four fewer people (39) were put to death 
in 2013 compared to 2012.

The state of Texas accounted for 41 per cent of all 
executions, while Maryland became the 18th US state to abolish the 
death penalty.

Three countries in the region - Grenada, Guatemala and 
Saint Lucia - reported empty death rows for the first time since Amnesty
 began keeping records in 1980.

Asia

Vietnam
 and Indonesia both resumed executions last year, with Indonesia using 
the death penalty for the first time in four years.

China continued to execute more people than the rest of the world put 
together, but with the death penalty treated as a state secret reliable 
data is impossible to obtain.

New legal protections were introduced in death penalty cases and China’s 
Supreme Court announced an end to the practice of organ harvesting from
 executed prisoners.

No executions were reported in Singapore and 
several death row prisoners had their sentences commuted.

Europe and Central Asia

For
 the first time since 2009, Europe and Central Asia was an 
execution-free zone. The only country still using the death penalty is 
Belarus, although it did not execute anyone in 2013.
