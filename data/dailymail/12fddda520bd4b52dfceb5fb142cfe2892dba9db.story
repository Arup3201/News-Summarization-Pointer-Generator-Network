A benefits claimant who has been on the dole for 20 years has fathered 26 children with 15 women, it emerged today.

Peter Rolfe, 64, who lives in a council home in Newport, Isle of Wight, has reportedly cost the British taxpayer £500,000 through claiming child and housing benefits.

The man first hit the headlines this March when he claimed his human rights were being violated  because his local council would only provide him with a four-bedroom house.

Mr Rolfe claims to have 26 children - 14 girls and 12 boys - by 15 women. He said today: 'Some of them [the mothers of his children] got pregnant on purpose. It's just so unfortunate so many women have fallen pregnant'

At the time, he claimed he had 18 children by ten women while demanding council bosses had a ‘duty of care’ to upgrade him and his family to a six-bedroom home.

Now the man says he actually has 26 children - 14 boys and 12 girls - by a staggering 15 women while appearing on a new Channel 5 documentary.

In shocking scenes featured on Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole, Mr Rolfe also make the staggering suggestion the mothers of his children are to blame for the size of his brood adding: 'Some of them I believe got pregnant on purpose.'

In an interview with the Daily Express, the man continued: 'It is really difficult to keep track when you've had 26 kids with so many different women.

'You have women that like you and once they get you they try to change you. They become pregnant and things like that.

'Some of them got pregnant on purpose. It's just so unfortunate so many women have fallen pregnant.'

Mr Rolfe used to receive £800 a week thanks to the benefits system. This figure has since been cut following a benefits cap introduced last year.

He is still calling for his local council to upgrade his family to a larger home - saying his current residence is 'like a prison cell'.

Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe last night slammed Mr Rolfe as 'Britain's most feckless father.'

The documentary follows the lives of some of Britain's biggest benefits claimants - and exposes parents who see their children as a ticket to an easy life.

Other 'stars' of the show include Tim Fisk and Mandy Ball - who claim £80,000 a year in benefits and support 14 children.

Another, single mother Marie Buchan, 32, claims £2,200 a month in handouts has seven girls and one boy.

According to the latest figures, the British benefits bill hit £167.7billion which is expected to increase to £171.5billion by 2018-9.

Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The point of the welfare state is to support the most vulnerable in the society, not to be a long-term alternative to work.

'The government cannot tell people how many children to have but taxpayers will be rightly outraged at stories of such irresponsible behaviour while hard-pressed families cut corners to make ends meet. It is entirely reasonable to expect people to plan their lives according to their means.'

Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole is on Channel 5 on Monday at 9pm.
