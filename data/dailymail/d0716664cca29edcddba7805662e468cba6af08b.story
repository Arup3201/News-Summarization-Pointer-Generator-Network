Footage of strangers kissing seems to be in vogue at the moment.

The First Kiss, in which artist Tatia Pilieva asks 20 complete strangers to lock lips on screen, set social media sites ablaze last week.

But back in 1872, one pioneering English photographer was ahead of the trend when he filmed what is thought to be the first ever footage of a couple kissing.

Due to social conventions of the time, the kiss is between two female models as photographer Eadweard Muybridge was unable to film naked men in the same frame as naked women.

‘While the Victorians were extremely sexually prudish by modern standards and commonly considered male homosexuality a serious threat to their society they believed women had little or no sex drive,’ states Muybride Online archive.

‘The Kiss’, like most of the image sequences in the Muybride Online archive, was produced some time between 1872 and 1885 - significantly before the invention of the motion picture camera.

Eadweard Muybridge's biographical details are just as intriguing as his work. Born Edward Muggeridge in 1830 at Kingston upon Thames, he was unsatisfied with life in this small English town, and by 1850 he had left to make his fortune in the U.S.

His most famous work began in 1872, when he was hired by Leland Stanford  to photograph horses.

But the photographer became distracted when he found that his young wife had taken a lover. Muybridge
 shot and killed the man, called Major Harry Larkyns, 
after learning that he may have fathered their seven-month-old son.When Muybridge stood trial, he did not deny the killing, but he was nonetheless acquitted.

It was created using banks of still cameras firing in sequence. Essentially, every one of Muybridge’s plates is a film first, according to the archive.

In the 1870s, details of how objects move were unknown. Without film, the human eye was unable to understand details of fast motion.

For the Kingston-born photographer, nudity was crucial so that viewers could clearly see how the body moved in his series of photographs.

And it wasn’t just human activity that the photographer captured. In 1872, Muybride was hired by Leland Stanford, later the founder of Stanford University, to photograph horses.

Stanford reputedly had made a bet that for a moment, all four of a racehorse's hooves are off the ground simultaneously, and he hired Muybridge to take the pictures to prove him right.

At the end of his life, Muybridge returned from the U.S to England, where he died in 1904.
