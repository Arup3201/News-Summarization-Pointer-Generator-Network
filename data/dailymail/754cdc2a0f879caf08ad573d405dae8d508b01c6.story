A lightning strike at a New York City beach left three men injured as thunderstorms and torrential rain battered the area on Sunday, interrupting Labor Day weekend celebrations.

A 49-year-old man and his 19-year-old son were seeking shelter beneath a tree at Orchard Beach on Pelham Bay in the Bronx around 5pm on Sunday when lightning hit a tree and sent the men flying 10 feet, a friend told Telemundo.

The father and son and a third man were treated at hospital but are said to be alert and conscious.

The lightning strike hit as heavy thunderstorms and rain swept through the city on Sunday afternoon, halting play at The US Open tennis tournament, grounding flights and prompting flash flood warnings to be issued to residents across the city.

Revelers at the Electric Zoo music festival on Randall's Island were also evacuated and the event was cancelled while some people using the city's Subway had to wade through the water which had gathered underground.

The deluge also caused travel delays with LaGuardia airport halting departures on Sunday afternoon as it waited for the thunderstorms to clear. JFK also stopped flights from landing during the storms that were expected to last two hours in New York.

On Monday morning, dozens of flights were canceled, with Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey the most affected, according to Flight Stats.

But it wasn't only New York suffering the downpour; the holiday weekend has so far seen 162 storms from the Great Plains to the Northeast.

In Philadelphia, the Made in America festival was called off because of stormy weather, while in Gainesville, Florida, lightning halted the game between the Florida Gators and Idaho Vandals. Heavy rain in Lake Charles, Mississippi, brought flooding with several feet of standing water in the town.

In Crawford, Iowa, officials said one person was hit by lightning, while other parts of the state saw 80mph winds, which knocked out power to thousands, ABC News reported. 

On Monday, the Midwest could see 60mph winds, hail the size of golf balls and possible tornadoes. Thunderstorms are expected to spread across cities including Kansas City, St Louis, Chicago and Detroit.

Another band of unpleasant weather is set to bring rain on the East Coast from Florida in the south north to Virginia, Maryland, Washington and New York City.   

Labor Day barbecues may have to be postponed across the East, particularly away from coastal areas as the risk of thunderstorms linger.

Meanwhile moisture from a depression hovering over the Gulf Coast is being sucked in a north easterly direction.
