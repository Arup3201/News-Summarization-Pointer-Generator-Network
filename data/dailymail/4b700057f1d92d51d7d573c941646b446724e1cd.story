The first image has emerged of the daughter and son-in-law accused of murdering an elderly couple who were found buried in their own garden after they vanished 15 years ago.

The court artist's drawing shows Susan Patricia Edwards, 55, and her husband, Christopher John Edwards, 57, who appeared at Nottingham Crown Court charged with the murders of William and Patricia Wycherley, who would now be 100 and 79 respectively, between May 1 and May 31 1998.

Police found remains buried in the back garden of a house in Forest Town, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on October 9, following a tip-off.

Formal identification has yet to be confirmed but they are believed to be those of Mr and Mrs Wycherley.

The couple moved into the address in 1987, and, according to neighbours, disappeared in 1998.

Post-mortem tests carried out on the remains have revealed that each person died as a result of being shot.

Mr and Mrs Edwards, of no fixed address, were arrested at St Pancras International railway station in London on Wednesday evening on suspicion of the murders, Nottinghamshire Police said.

Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court this morning for a brief hearing, Susan Edwards, wearing a beige flowery cardigan and brown trousers, spoke only to confirm her name.

Her husband, dressed in burgundy trousers, black sweater and wearing glasses, also spoke only to confirm his name.

A provisional trial date has been set for June 2 next year.

No application for bail was made and both defendants were remanded in custody to next appear at Nottingham Crown Court on November 15 for a preliminary hearing.
