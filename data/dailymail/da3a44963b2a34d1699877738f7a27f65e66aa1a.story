Derek Knight was banned for life from driving today as he walked away from Truro Crown Court with a suspended jail term for killing partner Wendy Buttery in a car crash

A motorist who killed his partner when he smashed into a tree has been banned from driving for life.

Derek Knight, 68, showed no remorse for causing the death of Wendy Buttery, his partner of 25 years, a judge said as he handed out the ban and a suspended jail term.

Knight, 68, lost control of his Peugeot 307, veered off the road and crashed into a tree as he overtook a cyclist on the A39 in Trispen, Cornwall.

Mrs Buttery, 76, was travelling in the front seat of the car. She suffered severe chest injuries and died at the scene after the accident on June 4 last year.

Knight, of St Ewe, Cornwall, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving at Truro Crown Court.

He had never held a UK driving licence but claimed to hold an international licence and said he had driven across 42 countries in his lifetime.

He was convicted by a jury at Truro Crown Court of causing the death by careless driving of Mrs Buttery, a grandmother-of-six.

Judge Graham Cottle jailed him for nine months, suspended for two years, imposed a three month weekend nighttime curfew and imposed the lifetime driving ban.

Knight denied the charge. He told the jury a piece of cardboard fell from the dashboard and obstructed his pedals, causing the engine to rev and preventing him from braking.

But forensic examinations found nothing that would have affected the controls.

Prosecutor Philip Lee said Knight threw ‘explanations in the air like confetti in the hope they would land in the right place’ and branded his explanation an ‘invention’.

A judge said Knight showed no remorse over the death of long-term partner Wendy Buttery. The couple had been together for 20 years

After the verdict, Judge Graham Cottle told the court: 'Anytime he got into that vehicle, or any other vehicle, he was committing a crime.

'I don’t think he should drive again quite frankly.'

The judge said Knight had not shown ‘any kind of remorse’ for Mrs Buttery’s death.

He said: 'If you kill your partner of 25 years by a piece of driving that is pretty poor. Don’t you feel sorry for that?'

Maria White, one of Mrs Buttery's four stepdaughters, said: 'As the judge said he showed no remorse and that’s what hurts.

'He could not even say "I’m sorry I killed her".'
