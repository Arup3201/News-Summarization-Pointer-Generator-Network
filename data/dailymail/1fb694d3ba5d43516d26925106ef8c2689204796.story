Black clouds, spectacular lightning strikes and howling thunder have rolled across Sydney, signalling an end to a glorious weekend stretch of hot, sunny weather.

The weather turned quickly on Monday afternoon as apocalyptic-looking clouds descended on the city - and more is expected along Australia's east coast over the next 24 hours.

It comes as hilarious footage emerged of a woman reacting to a huge lightning strike during a storm - and went viral after it was uploaded to YouTube. 

When Mother Nature put on a dramatic display last week over Newcastle, north of Sydney, the woman couldn't contain herself, shrieking as she ran inside for cover.

Up to 10,000 homes were blacked out as a result of the late Sunday storms which swept through northern New South Wales. 

A number of fires are also burning across the state after being sparked by lightning strikes.

Australia's east coast is bracing for more storm activity in the next 24 hours and storm watchers best beware, as a woman in Newcastle proved that sometimes getting too close, can be a health hazard

More than 10,000 homes were blacked out as a result of the late Sunday storms which swept through northern New South Wales

The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) reports that it is battling 90 blazes so far, 47 of which are deemed out of control.

Most were caused by lightning strikes late on Sunday that followed scorching temperatures in Sydney and around the state, NSW RFS spokesman Ben Shepherd said.

The Bureau of Meteorology reported that the unsettled conditions were being caused by a slow-moving low-pressure trough, with forecast of storms in southern and western parts of the state.

Peter Zmijewski, senior meteorologist at Bureau of Meteorology, told Daily Mail Australia that the high temperatures were not unseasonal but because of the changing seasons. 

He said: 'This time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why we can experience very hot and cold in the same day.'

The November to January temperature outlooks indicate a warmer than normal season for both daytime and night-time temperatures across most of Australia.

'There's a build up of heat due to the clear sunny days which has allowed heat to build,' said Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott.

'The heat is slowly moving ahead of a slow pressure trough.'

'It's not unusual, it's the summer pattern arriving and we have a lot of moisture in the air,' said Ms Westcott. 

According to the Weather Bureau, this time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why Australians can experience very hot and cold in the same day

Up to 10,000 homes were blacked out by the fierce Newcastle storm on Sunday

The Bureau also states that 'the Pacific Ocean has shown some renewed signs of El Niño development in recent weeks'.

'Above-average temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean have warmed further in the past fortnight.'
