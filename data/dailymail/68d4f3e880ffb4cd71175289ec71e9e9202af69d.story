An American diplomat has been expelled from Delhi as India kicks back at the U.S. after one of its diplomatic team was forced to leave.

India's deputy consul in New York, Devyani Khobragade, was facing an indictment charging her with visa fraud and paying her housekeeper below the minimum wage.

As she arrived back in India to take up a post at the United Nations that offers her diplomatic immunity, the U.S. was ordered to remove one member of its diplomatic team from its embassy in Delhi.

The name of the official due to be removed from Delhi is not known, but it is believed that they are of a similar rank to Khobragade.

The State Department confirmed to NBC that one of its officials will be leaving Delhi, as tensions between the countries increased after Khobragade was arrested and strip-searched.

'We deeply regret that the Indian 
government felt it was necessary to expel one of our diplomatic 
personnel. This has clearly been a challenging time in the U.S.-India 
relationship,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

Khobragade's arrest on December 12 was denounced as 'barbaric' by Indian officials, who refused to waive her diplomatic immunity so she could be prosecuted.

In the rising tension over the case, security barriers around the U.S. Embassy in Delhi were removed, and a visiting delegation was snubbed by Indian officials, the BBC reported.

An order has also been made to halt 
'commercial activities' at the embassy, which has a bowling alley, 
swimming pool and gym, and is used by non-diplomats.

In the U.S. a 20-page indictment had accused 39-year-old Khobragade of creating a fake employment contract to obtain a visa for her housekeeper, Sangeet Richard, that claimed she would be paid $9.75 an hour for a 40-hour week.

However, a Manhattan grand jury found the housekeeper was paid less than $2 an hour after being made to work more than 90 hours a week, with no days off or sick leave.

When India refused to lift her diplomatic immunity, the U.S. ordered Khobragade to leave the country. She will be allowed to return only to face a court.

Khobragade has denied the charges. A statement issued by her lawyer Daniel Arshack said: 'She knows she has done no wrong and looks forward to assuring the truth is known.'
