American freestyle skier Heidi Kloser has had to pull out of the Olympics after breaking her right leg during a training run before moguls qualifying.

Kloser, 21, broke her femur and tore knee ligaments in a crash on Thursday night, only moments before she was supposed to head to the starting gate.

Images showed her being carried away from the course on a sled and she was taken to a medical clinic for athletes in the Olympic village.

Heartbreaking: Heidi Kloser is stretchered off the course after crashing before qualifying on Thursday. She fractured her leg and tore her ACL and has been forced to pull out of the Games

'The news isn't good,' Kloser's father wrote on his Facebook page. 'She has a 
partially torn MCL, completely torn ACL, an impact fracture on her 
Femur, and a impact bruise on her Tibia Plateau.

'Heidi's doing ok, but 
there's moments when the reality of it all hits home. She's a tough one,
 but this is a tough one to swallow for all of us!'

He added that when they were in the ambulance, Heidi asked if she was still an Olympian.

'We 
said of course she is,' he wrote.

He added to the Denver Post that she hopes to walk with her teammates in the Opening ceremony on Friday night.

Excitement: Kloser, left, and her teammates grinned ahead of training in Sochi this week

Sadness: Kloser's father described the incident on Facebook and said they still consider her an Olympian

'She's completely bummed, as we are,' 
Kloser said. 'She was really hoping, all things considered, to at least 
be able to start in Saturday's final qualifier.'

Skier Heather McPhie, who qualified 14th, said that the risk of knee injury is always in the back of competitors' minds.

'Unfortunately, it's part of the sport,' she said.

Kloser
 is a five-year veteran of the U.S. Freestyle team and had four top-10 
finishes, including a career-best second-place finish in Kreischberg, 
Austria, during the 2013 World Cup season.

She was ranked second in the U.S and fourth in the world entering the competition.

Disappointing: Kloser, right with her teammates in December, had entered the competition ranked 4th
