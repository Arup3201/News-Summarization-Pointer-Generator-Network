After being convicted of the double murder of her two teenage children earlier this week, the twisted hand-written journal that allowed a jury to find Julie Schenecker guilty has been released, painting a picture of a bitter and evil mother struggling to deal with her bipolar disorder and abuse of drugs and alcohol.

The at-time incoherent notes, which were written in a school book that belonged to her 13-year-old son Beau, were made public as Parker Schenecker spoke out about his former wife's trial and how he can now finally move on.

The retired Army Colonel said he agreed with jurors rejecting Schenecker's insanity defense, believing she was acting with a sane mind when shooting dead her son and 16-year-old daughter Calyx in Tampa in January 2011.

'I think there was a resentment from her for a lot of circumstances,' Parker Schenecker told WTSP.

'There were some things that she had done that she was now having to take responsibility for, and I do think she was desperate, angry and upset just as the prosecution laid out to the jury.'

Guilty: Julie Schenecker, right, listens to the closing arguments as the trial into the double murder of her children comes to a close on Thursday. The diary she used to document her murderous thoughts have now been released

Sentenced: Schenecker cries and puts her head in her hands as the judge sends her to life in prison

Closure: Parker Schenecker, pictured in court on Thursday, said the verdict won't bring his children back but it will help the family move on

Victims: Calyx, 16, and Beau, 13, were murdered by their mother in Tampa in 2011. She shot them both in the head for being 'mouthy'

Haunting: Pages from Julie Schenecker's journal which was used as evidence during her murder trial. In the stomach-churning notebook she detailed her plan to kill her children and then herself, however passed out before she could commit suicide

Parker Schenecker said he has found solace over the years by keeping in touch with the friends of his children.

'You know, I'm still a father,' he said.

'I'm still a dad, whether Beau and Calyx are with me here on Earth or not. And that's what this really boils down to.

'Dads love and honor their kids forever.'

Schenecker's murder trial culminated in the blue spiral notebook that was left sitting on her bed, Tampa Bay Online reported.

Soaked in blood, it was turned to her last entry on January 27, which read: 'We're going Home today. Take us home Lord.'

Following a three-year investigation, jurors turned to its pages during their deliberation, reading aloud how she planned to buy a gun, kill her children and turn it on herself.

She had planned to kill herself after murdering her children, the prosecution said, but passed out through a combination of pills and alcohol before she was able to.

In her journal, one entry read: 'I offed Beau on the way to practice. I accidentally shot the window then shot him. One in the side of the head and one in his mouth because he became so mouthy just like Calyx.'

Another entry, about her daughter, read: '[I] walked up without [Calyx] reacting, and shot her in the right temple. Then shot her in the mouth, her sassy little mouth.'

It took the jury just two hours to find the 53-year-old guilty.

Taken away: Schenecker looks at her family as she is led out of court. Before she left, she apologized

Chilling: Schenecker writes exactly how she plans to shoot her children, Beau and Calyx, worrying that she will have to reload the gun

Some pages were completely coherent while others contained nonsensical ramblings. Here Schenecker has simply written: 'You're a failure.'

The wide-ruled, single-subject notebook - a staple of drugstore school supply aisles - belonged to Schenecker's 13-year-old son, Beau, whose name is written neatly on its cover along with the subject 'Language Arts'

Trial: Parker Schenecker examines evidence at the trial of his wife. Prosecutors claimed Juilie Schenecker killed their children in anger at him

Along with warnings of a coming 'massacre' and her promise that 'the evil starts Thursday', Schenecker devoted pages to planning what should be done after she and her children were found dead.

'I have no idea where to do the memorial service,' she wrote, suggesting a few possible locations, including the Tampa Palms Golf & Country Club. 

She wanted their bodies to be donated to science, but she also asked to be cremated and have her children's ashes mixed with hers. 

Her clothes should be given away, she wrote, and wanted her family and girlfriends to be informed of her passing.

'Maybe post it on facebook,' she wrote, listing her username and password. 

'Everyone I know & love is on facebook.'

Schenecker also worried her children would become bipolar like her. 

'If you're wondering why I decided to take out the kids it's to protect them from embarrassing them for the rest of their lives,' she wrote.

She devoted an entire page to listing the things Calyx had supposedly wronged her.

'Sprayed lysol in my face when I came in from smoking,' she wrote. 

'Wants to euthanize one of the cats.'

'said recently ''If I commit suicide it's all your fault!''.'

Plea: Schenecker, pictured being led into the courtroom on Thursday, had tried to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, but a jury found she was sane at the time of the killings

Beau had been her 'ally' she wrote, and Calyx had been the 'bully'.

At the top of one page she wrote only: 'You're a failure.'

In the hours after she killed her children, she returned to the journal.

'I have really lost my mind. . . I'm so sad, my two babies! It was too easy to take them out.'

The prosecution said Schenecker's motive was anger and resentment toward her 
husband, saying she intended him to come home and find his family dead.

Schenecker now faces a life sentence after the possibility of a death penalty 
was ruled out.

As she was sentenced to life in prison with no parole, Schenecker addressed the court, saying: 'I shot my son and daughter, I don’t know why,' Fox 13 reported.

She apologized for the killing and, through tears, said: 'I know my children are I heaven. I want people to try to find comfort and meaning, as I do, that they are in no pain.'

'I'm prepared and accept your sentence.

'I apologize, I apologize to everyone in this courtroom who I have broken, the lives I have destroyed. I hope they can collect themselves as best as possible. All of us. Not just this courtroom - anybody who knew our family, Calyx and Beau, our children's friends, teachers, coaches, our relatives, aunts, cousins, grandparents, uncles, nieces, nephews, everyone has been so deeply affected and I understand that there are people affected by this that maybe just read about in the paper, maybe a child looked at their mommy and said, "Mommy are you ever going to shoot me?" I know that this could happen, and I apologize for what happened, what I did. I take responsibility. I was there.

'I know I shot my son and daughter. I don't know why. But I have a period of time to try to understand that.

'Your honor, the judicial system in the U.S. is the best in the world. We don't lash our women 125 times for driving when they're not supposed to drive. I'm proud to stand here in front of you, as I understand you might be prior service as well. And to serve my country, and I proudly said the first code conduct as a soldier, in 83, I said - I said, I'm an American fighting man [sic], serving in the forces which protect our country and our way and our way of life, an I’m prepared to give my life in their defense. I said that proudly, it changed, we’re no longer by men, we’re fighting in the forces which protect our country.

'It’s our trust and I believe in you and what you’ve done. You’ve run a great court. I have no experience, from what I’ve seen, you control the court tremendously well. I thank my attorneys who supported me, and I trusted them and they worked so well. And all those people behind me on my team, put in many, many hours on this case. I will never be able to repay all these people, I have no way to repay, but to say thank you. So thank you to the entire American judicial system. I am not playing you're honor, and that is heartfelt.

'I have one more... I know our children are in Heaven. I want people to try to find comfort and meaning as I do that they are in no pain. And they are alive and enjoying everything and anything Heaven has to offer, Jesus protecting them and keeping them safe until we get there, and their loved ones follow us to join them. That’s all your honor, I appreciate you letting me speak.'
