A small part of Thorndike, Maine has been turned into the Shire, thanks to a company that's manufacturing real-life Hobbit holes.

Rocy and Melissa Pillsbury run Wooden Wonders, a company that makes Lord of the Rings-style buildings to be used as playhouses, storage sheds, saunas, adult-sized cottages and chicken coops.

For those who haven't read J.R.R. Tolkien's books, Hobbit holes are the underground homes main characters Frodo and Bilbo Baggins live in when they're not on their own adventures.

Mr Pillsbury says he first became enchanted with the subterranean homes when he watched the Lord of the Rings cartoon growing up.

'The portrayal of the Hobbit house was just real cool,' he told told WMTW. 'It was a house under the ground, with a round door, beautiful concept, beautiful architecture.'

The Pillsbury's homes are not built into the ground, but they look nearly identical to the film Hobbit holes in every other way.

Mrs Pillsbury says they make the Hobbit holes with the same materials as a residential home.

Family business: Husband and wife Rocy and Melissa Pillsbury started the company and when they're not building the holes, they're delivering the kits around the country

DIY: The homes are shipped across the country in kits, to be assembled by the new owner

'We like to call these a mulch-generational playhouses because not only will your kids play in them but so will your grand kids,' she said.

The Pillsbury's currently run their business with a staff of nine, and they're barely able to keep up with the demand for their cute homes.

When they aren't building the holes, they're driving across the country with their young kids to install the homes and just finished up a 45-day trip from Georgia to Wisconsin.

The Hobbit holes range in price from a $995 small chicken coop to a large playhouse that's $2,225.

Wooden Wonders ships the homes in kit form, allowing the new owner to construct the hole themselves.Â 

Multi-purpose: The homes can be used for storage, a sauna, chicken coop or a child's playhouse house

Long-lasting: The Pillsburys call the Hobbit holes multi-generational playhouses since they'll likely be around for both kids and grandkids
