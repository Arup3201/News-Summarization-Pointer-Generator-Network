Snake keeper: Pauline Wallace, seen carrying a Pets at Home bag, had 140 snakes in her 'modest' semi-detached home, a court heard

A mother kept 140 snakes in her semi-detached home and had another 20 dead ones in a freezer because she could not face burying them, a court heard.

Pauline Wallace, 64, stored her collection of pets in old sweet tubs, plastic bins and vivariums that were stacked from floor to ceiling.

The mother-of-one's 'snake colony' included blood pythons, carpet pythons, corn snakes, common boa constrictors and hypo-malanistic Boas.

The court heard that they were discovered in the property in York when the RSPCA went to check up after a tip-off.

Wallace also shared her 'modest' semi-detached property with her elderly mother and son.

Inspectors found the dead snakes in a fridge freezer along with a dead cat, York Magistrates' Court was told.

The mother was out shopping for more snakes when Inspector Heidi Cleaver and a local vet first called at her property.

She told the RSPCA she had 'around 140' snakes - but admitted she had so many she had lost count.

Inspector Cleaver told the court: 'The bedroom was quite small and was literally floor to ceiling with stacker boxes, some vivariums and smaller tubs.'

She said the 'chaotic garage' was also filled floor to ceiling with snakes in containers.

Inspector Cleaver opened one box and said: 'you were literally overwhelmed by the stench which can only be described as mouldy death'.

The court heard Wallace was issued with a warning notice and several snakes were euthanised.

She was given instructions to clean the vivariums, containers and tubs because the snakes were 'kept in filthy conditions detrimental to their wellbeing'.

Phil Brown, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: 'This large number of snakes was beyond the control of Mrs Wallace.'

The RSPCA made follow-up inspections and on her third visit last August Inspector Cleaver looked inside the fridge freezer in the garage.

She found 20 dead snakes inside together with a dead cat and Wallace said she was waiting for the right time to bury them in the back garden.

Inspector Cleaver said she was concerned no action had been taken and a number of live snakes were removed to leave Wallace with a more manageable amount.

A further inspection was carried out in September because there was no electricity supply to the garage which left it cold and more snakes were removed.

Prosecutor Mr Brown said Wallace was interviewed on three separate occasions but did not believe she had done anything wrong in relation to the husbandry of the snakes.

Wallace is facing 13 charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal and failing to ensure the welfare of her animals. She denies the offences.

The trial continues.
