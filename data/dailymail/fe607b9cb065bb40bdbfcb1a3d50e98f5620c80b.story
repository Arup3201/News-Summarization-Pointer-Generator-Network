A hunstman trekking through remote Colorado woods stumbled across an unusual prey - a mini-forest of illegally-grown marijuana plants.

The man made the find last Wednesday in the unincorporated Eagle County, some three hours' drive from Denver.

Sheriffs counted around 1,000 plants in total, which were fed via an elaborate irrigation system nestled in the trees, the Denver Post reports.

Gone native: A huntsman in Eagle County, Colorado, stumbled across this sea of green last week

Reported: Sheriffs counted up around 1,000 plants in the remote region of the state - and destroyed them all

They also found a campsite nearby - but are yet to track down any suspects.

The Eagle County Sheriff's Office said the investigation is continuing.

It follows a discovery near Aspen last month where hunters sniffed out a huge 2,600 plant hoard.

While it is legal to grow marijuana under Colorado state law, there is a limit of six plants per person, and the cultivation must take place in an 'enclosed, locked space'.

Illegal: While Colorado law permits small-scale marijuana growing, locals can grow only six plants - and they have to keep it inside and under lock and key
