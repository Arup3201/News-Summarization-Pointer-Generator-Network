Illinois Republican Rep. Aaron Schock, facing new pressure over lavish travel and redecorating expenses he charged to his official congressional budget, now says he's not sure if he broke any federal laws in the process.

'I ceratinly nope not,' he told an inside-the-beltway newspaper on Wednesday. 'I’m not an attorney.'

The interview with Politico turnedconfrontational when a testy Schock insisted outside advisers would review his office accounts and determine what went wrong.

'That’s what we can all do, is our best effort,' Schock said.

TROUBLE BREWING: Illinois Republican Rep. Aaron Schock is under fire for lavish office spending and potential accepting improper gifts, and now says 'I certainly hope' what he did was legal

DOWNTON OFFICE: Schock spent $40,000 in taxpayer funds redecorating his Capitol Hill office, but had to pay the money back

The litany of Schock's troubles seems to grow every week. 

First came the $40,000 in office expenses – later reimbursed after much public embarrassment – that Schock spent redecorating his office in over-the-top 'Downton Abbey' style.

'Haters are gonna hate,' the 33-year-old Schock told ABC News as the scandals swirled, invoking Taylor Swift lyrics.

Then news emerged that he had billed taxpayers for $10,000 in private jet travel including a November 2014 jaunt with staffers to see a Chicago Bears NFL game.

The Associated Press identified another $40,000 worth of free air travel that Schock logged on aircraft belonging to his donors.

Most recently he spent another $10,000 taking 10 staff members on a New York City trip when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in town.

The congressional aides reportedly did hardly any official work, but they did attend a Global Citizen Festival concert featuring Jay-Z and Carrie Underwood.

A political action committee associated with Schock, the GOP Generation Y Fund, spent $3,000 for the tickets.

The same campaign fund paid a $1,440 invoice from a massage parlor it engaged for a fundraising event.

Separately, Schock took his interns to a sold-out Katy Perry concert in Washington last June.

He has also been accused of improperly accepting gifts without reporting them, another potential legal violation.

Records show that those perks included dinners and presents during a 2011 London trip. He also hosted a 2014 fundraiser on a golf course without paying to use the facility.

Politico reported on Wednesday that Schock has hired two attorneys from the white-shoe law firm Jones Day – and a professional crisis communications firm – to help him wade through the legal and PR quicksand that now threatens to end his brief political career.

He said he expects that he'll have to file changes to his spending reports.

One of those will likely be a $3,245 expense for 'software' that turned out actually to be for the use of a plane by a software-company-owning donor.

'Well, I would say I take my compliance obligations seriously, Schock told Politico.

'So, to your point, you know, obviously there’s things that we’re going through and if there need to be amendments to my reports, there will be.'

But has he taken gifts without filing the required paperwork to document them? 

'I have not, uh – I would just leave it at that,' he said. 

He told reporters this week in a hastily called press conference that he has reached a 'point of reflection' about the scandals and vowed to change his ways, while acknowledging that at times that he may come across to his constituents as 'out of touch.' 

'I have tried to balance being a young congressman and doing things differently ... with maintaining a level of seriousness on the issues of the day,' Schock said. 

'I know some days I have failed at this.'
