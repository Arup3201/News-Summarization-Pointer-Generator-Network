Where are the rest?: Customers will notice a reduction in the size of their treats, but no cut in the price

Sweet manufacturers have been accused of snatching chocolates out of the mouths of children this Christmas by reducing the size of their party tubs.

Mars has cut the size of its tubs of Celebrations from 855g to 750g, which equates to a reduction of around 11 sweets compared to last year.

At the same time, tubs of Cadbury’s Heroes are down from 800g to 780g, which equates to two or three fewer chocolate treats.

The smaller sizes have not led to an equal reduction in the price with the result shoppers are being hit with what amounts to a stealth price rise.

It comes against a background of rising raw material costs and is a pattern that has been repeated across a range of products from cheese to packs of nappies.

One of Britain’s foremost sweet and chocolate industry experts, Angus Kennedy, said the pack reductions will not go down well with customers.

Mr Kennedy, the editor of Kennedy’s 
Confection magazine, said: ‘Sadly, reducing the size of the packets is 
now an unavoidable trend.’

He
said shoppers do not have time to check the weight of packs during the 
hectic Christmas shopping rush, which means they may well miss the 
reduction.

He said: ‘I have five kids and they love Celebrations. But, in effect, what Mars and Cadbury are doing to families is putting their fist in the tub, grabbing a handful and saying, ‘sorry guys not those ones’.

‘It’s 105 grams less which is around 11 chocolates. I don’t need to tell you the look you will see on my kids’ faces if you were to take that many sweets away in one go - especially without telling them.’

He added: ‘To win the trust of consumers, produces need to do the unusual thing and be accountable. They could at least say the three magic words - ‘we are sorry’.’

Cadbury defended reducing the size of its Dairy Milk and other products as a measure to help people cope with the cost of living squeeze

A Mars spokesman said: ‘Like all food manufacturers, we have seen
continued cost increases over recent years. We look to absorb the vast majority
of these costs by being more efficient, but on occasion this is not possible.
We always work hard to ensure we continue to offer our consumers great value
for money.’

Cadbury has defended reducing the size of its Dairy Milk and other products with a similar statement, adding: ‘Making these small reductions allows us to hold prices at current levels - which is important for our customers in these difficult economic times.

‘We still believe our chocolate represents excellent value for money and remains an affordable treat.’
