A rare half-male, half-female butterfly has been discovered by staff at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.

Now deceased, the unique creature was spotted upon emerging from its cocoon at the institution.

Telltale signs are the wings, with the left wing containing a pattern typical of the male and the right displaying markings typical of a female. 

The lexias pardalis butterfly is a species that has strong sexual dimorphism - with female displaying brown wings with yellow spots and males show off with simmering black and blue wings.

The body of the Drexel specimen is also split between male and female parts, a condition known as bilateral gynandromorphy, reports WPTV. 

Drexel's Academy of Natural Sciences will display the butterfly to the public beginning Jan. 17.

While such insects are rare its difficult to tell just how rare they are as in most species the sexes look similar.

Fifty-fifty: This is a female lexias pardalis butterfly, which shows yellow spots against brown wings

The male lexias pardalis butterfly is iridescent black and blue 

This is a different condition than hermaphroditism, as that would show the outward characteristics of only a single gender. 

'Gynandromorphism is most frequently noticed in bird and butterfly species where the two sexes have very different coloration. It can result from non-disjunction of sex chromosomes, an error that sometimes occurs during the division of chromosomes at a very early stage of development,' one researcher told reporters.
