New Yorkers have resorted to digging through filthy dumpsters for food ahead of their fourth night without power and, for many, without water.

Shocking images captured groups of residents sifting through garbage outside a Key Food supermarket at Avenue A and East 4th Street in the East Village yesterday.

Families, elderly people and young residents were seen climbing into the dumpster hunting for whatever they could find to eat.

According to NBC New York, whose 
crews came across the shocking scene, the local supermarket had 
discarded piles of food that had gone bad after Hurricane Sandy shut 
down power in the area on Monday.

The
 dumpster divers in the East Village pried open the overflowing bin 
before climbing inside to pick through the garbage for something to eat 
or take home to their families.

The Lower East Side and East Village neighborhoods have both been in darkness for days.

As the death toll passes 90 and continues to rise, thousands of apartments, bodegas and 
restaurants remained closed yesterday after they were flooded and left 
without power during the storm.

Some have been selling their wares 
for cash, as their credit card facilities are disabled while others were
 giving away perishables earlier in the week while they were still 
edible.

The desperate situation, which is seeing both neighborhoods appear more and more like a war zone, is expected to continue.

Hundreds of residents of downtown Manhattan are still living in shelters after Sandy left their buildings uninhabitable.

One shelter is allowing people to power up their phones to make calls to let friends and family members know how they are doing, although many are still unable to get a signal.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city will send bottled water and ready-to-eat meals into the hardest-hit neighborhoods throughout the weekend, but some New Yorkers, dispirited after days without power, water and heat, decided to get out.

'It's dirty, and it's getting a little crazy down there,' said Michael Tomeo, who boarded a bus to Philadelphia with his four-year-old son. 'It just feels like you wouldn't want to be out at night. Everything's pitch dark. I'm tired of it, big-time.'

Rima Finzi-Strauss decided to take 
the bus to Washington, DC. When the power went out on Monday night in 
her apartment building on the Lower East Side, it also disabled the 
electric locks on the front door, she said.

'We had three guys sitting out in the
 lobby last night with candlelight, and very threatening folks were 
passing by in the pitch black,' she said. 'And everyone's leaving. That 
makes it worse.'

Rosemarie Zurlo said she planned to 
leave Manhattan for her sister's place in Brooklyn because her own 
apartment was freezing - but she was worried she wouldn't make it back.

'I don't have three people to put in my car,' she said.

'I've been stranded here for five 
days,' said Stuart Zager, who is from Brooklyn and was trying to get to 
his place in Delray Beach, Florida.

'I'm afraid to get on the Jersey Turnpike. On half a tank, I'll never make it.'
