Sol Campbell's claims are just sinking in with Paul Ince when he starts rattling off the names of some England captains down the years.

‘There’s been me, Adams, Pearce, Seaman, Shearer, Terry, Ferdinand... that’s a lot of big names with a lot of big egos,’ declared Ince.

‘Sol’s a clever, articulate man and he’s a friend of mine but he wouldn’t have been England captain for 10 years — nobody is.

Main man: Ince played 53 times for his country, scoring twice, and was England's first black captain

New dawn: Ince was made England's first black captain in 1993, and went on to skipper the side seven times

‘He has obviously had different experiences to me as a footballer and I can only really talk about my own.’

Ince
 knows what it takes to lead the country: a fiery, competitive warrior 
who was first named  England captain in 1993 against the USA in Foxboro,
 Massachusetts.

He was the first black England player to wear the armband and yet Ince has mixed views about the stir it caused.

‘For
 me it was the pinnacle of my career when Graham Taylor made me captain,
 but I can remember feeling uncomfortable with the questions.

Maestro: Former Liverpool and Manchester United midfielder Ince earned 53 England caps, scoring twice

Big names, big egos: Ince (left) believes the likes of Pearce (right) were made captain because of character

Rare: Campbell was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term

‘I
 just wanted to be the England captain, I didn’t want to be remembered 
as the first black England captain because I didn’t look at it in that 
way.

‘Then, after the game, I
 began to look at it in a different way because I had a lot of parents 
from the ghetto sending me letters telling me it had inspired their 
children to get jobs or to start playing football.

‘I
 don’t know whether they were black, white or Asian or whatever, but it 
didn’t matter. That meant a lot, to think that somehow I had inspired 
people I had never even met.’

Campbell
 has made some  startling claims, chief among them the idea that the 
game’s governing body in this country is institutionally racist.

The
 former England defender, who was named captain three times during a 
distinguished international career, has convinced himself that his 
colour prevented him leading his country more often.

Trusted: Ince was made captain for England's crucial World Cup qualifier in Rome against Italy by Glenn Hoddle

‘We can make too much of the captaincy and what it means,’ added Ince.

‘I
 was captain of pretty much every team I played for — Manchester United,
 Inter Milan, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Wolves and England — so my 
colour didn’t come into it.

‘Sol is a friend of mine and he was around for Euro 96 under Terry Venables and again at the World Cup in 1998.

‘I
 didn’t deal with the FA often enough, but there was never any issue 
over my skin colour with my team-mates or people I came across within 
the organisation.

‘I have no
 reason to believe they are racist — who are we talking about? I loved 
people like David Davies (former executive director at the FA) and I 
just never  encountered it.

‘Sol
 has every right to his view and we all have opinions, but in my 
experience I just didn’t see it. I was an England player, an England 
captain, I didn’t think about it.’

Friends: Campbell with former England captain Alan Shearer, who skippered his nation on 34 occasions

Skipper: Campbell with fellow centre-back Tony Adams, who captained England 15 times

Ince
 captained England seven times, famously leading the country to the 
World Cup finals in 1998 in a blood-stained shirt after a typically 
combative performance alongside Paul Gascoigne against Italy in Rome.

‘Adams,
 Gascoigne, Southgate, Wright and Sol all played in that game and I had a
 responsibility to wear the armband against a very good Italy team.

‘I
 can remember the night before the Italy game. I was with Ian Wright and
 we were both so  nervous that we couldn’t sleep because we didn’t want 
to let the country down the next night.

‘I
 felt a responsibility to the country, but the captaincy would have 
meant nothing to me if I didn’t have the respect of the other players. 
That was important to me.

‘My
 England team-mates didn’t look at me and think, “Paul Ince is a black 
England captain”, and neither did the manager. Why is that an issue?

Leading the pack: Rio Ferdinand (front centre) is the only black player to be England's official leading captain

Influential: The former Tottenham, Arsenal and Portsmouth defender won 73 caps with England

‘Glenn
 Hoddle was the manager and he chose the person he felt could do the job
 the best at that particular time — he could pick who he wanted. Glenn 
was the manager and should have been for a lot longer. He chose the 
captain, as Graham Taylor and Terry Venables did before him and the FA 
never had any say in it.’

Paul Ince... 7 (inc 6 friendlies)Sol Campbell... 3 (3)Rio Ferdinand... 7(4)Ashley Cole... 1 (1)

TOTAL... 18 (14)

Ince represented his country 53 times and retired from international football after England’s Euro 2000 exit.

He
 went on to become a manager with Blackburn, Macclesfield and, most 
recently, Blackpool but fears that a number of top, former black 
England  players are being lost to the game.

Ince, now 47, added: ‘We have lost a lot of good black players out of the game, such as Sol, Wright, Bright.

‘We
 have to give them inspiration to stay involved because this is the 21st
 century. I was 32 when I started thinking about what was next for me.

Finally: Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole captains England against Ireland in May after earning 100 caps

‘I
 understand there are obstacles in the way because we have to be 
prepared to do our A licence and our Pro Licence if we want to be 
managers.

‘I have had five jobs now and I think I have done well at all of them and still think I should be manager of Blackpool.

‘It
 would have been easy to sit on my a**e for five years and wait but I 
didn’t want to do that. I wanted to prove I could do it and I have done 
that at clubs with limited resources.

‘People like Keith Alexander, RIP, did so much for the game and showed black players that they could go on to become managers.

‘Last
 year there was a lot of talk about the Rooney Rule, giving an ethnic 
minority candidate the opportunity to make a case for a job. We jumped 
on that and then it’s all gone away.

‘Maybe
 Sol needs to decide what he wants to do with his career now that he has
 stopped playing and commit to whatever it is he wants to do.’
