It was an impressive Saturday for Stoke City striker Peter Crouch.

He scored inside 19 seconds to help his side to an unlikely win against Arsenal, before heading to Brixton to crowd-surf at a Kasabian gig.

It is not the first time the six foot seven target man has been spotted watching the Leicester-born rockers, after he was in attendance with wife Abbey Clancy at their iTunes Festival show in September.

But Crouch took it one step further this time, as he mounted a friend's shoulders close to the stage, before crowd-surfing over the heads of some surprised fans.

Earlier in the day, the former England man opened the scoring as Stoke raced to a 3-0 lead against Arsenal, before a second-half fightback from Arsene Wenger's side.

Crouch had reason to celebrate though, as the Potters held on for an impressive victory.

Rather than head home after the game, the 33-year-old followed the Arsenal supporters down the M6 towards the capital just in time for Kasabian's show. 

And as far as Saturdays go, Crouch's is up there with the best of them.
