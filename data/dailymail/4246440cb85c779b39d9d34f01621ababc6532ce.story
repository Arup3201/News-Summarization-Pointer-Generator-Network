Obama has expanded a list of potential targets in Syria as he struggles to gather international support for military action.

The US and France are so far the only nations attending the G20 to have backed the use of military force against the Assad regime, with Russia and China insisting that any action in the absence of UN Security Council approval would be illegal.

Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta - who also attended this morning's aid meeting - said in a tweet last night that 'the G20 has just now finished the dinner session, at which the divisions about Syria were confirmed'.

A spokesman for the Russian presidency said a US strike on Syria would 'drive another nail into the coffin of international law'.

Tense: World leaders met at the G20 summit in Russia as tensions over the Syrian conflict threatened to torpedo the work plan of the summit

Russia has steadfastly backed Assad - 
militarily, economically and diplomatically - and disputes claims that 
Assad's regime was behind chemical attacks that the U.S. says killed 
more than 1,400 Syrians. Other estimates are lower.

US frustrations over Russia's stance were reflected in comments by the American envoy to the UN, Samantha Power, who told a New York news conference: 'Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to hold the (Security) Council hostage and shirk its international responsibilities.

'What we have learned, what the Syrian people have learned, is that the Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the Security Council we have.'

A fleeting interaction between Obama 
and Putin became the high-drama moment of the summit, underscoring the 
labored state of relations between the two leaders who stand on opposing
 sides of the Syrian conflict.

In public, at least, the Russian and the American were all smiles 
Thursday, making small talk in front of news cameras for a few seconds 
as Obama arrived at the summit. But the welcoming handshake may have 
been where the pleasantries ended.

The Pentagon has been instructed by Obama to draw up a more extensive list of potential targets in Syria, according to the New York Times.

Moving forward: There are signs that Mr Obama may struggle to secure support in Congress for his proposal of 'limited and proportionate' military action against Assad

Future:  A poll suggested more than one-third of Congress members were undecided whether or not to back military action, while a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the President

This means expanding beyond the 50 or so 
major sites that were part of the original target list developed with France. 

The newspaper reported that he gave 
the instruction following intelligence indicating that Assad has been 
moving troops and equipment used for chemical weapons.

The aim would not be to strike the chemical weapons instead headquarters overseeing efforts, military units and rockets.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin said Russia was boosting its naval presence in the Mediterranean Sea, moving in warships 'primarily' for a possible evacuation of Russians from Syria.

The US Government accuses Assad's 
forces of killing 1,429 people in a poison-gas attack in a suburb of the
 Syrian capital, Damascus, on August 21.

On the sidelines of the summit, Obama
 met Friday morning with Chinese President Xi Jinping, building on 
discussions the two had in June in California. At the start of the 
session, Xi touted the 'bountiful results' yielded by those talks, 
including closer military-to-military cooperation.

Obama said he and the Chinese leader planned to confer on issues ranging from the economy to North Korea's nuclear program.

'Although there will continue to be 
some significant disagreements and sources of tension, I am confident 
that they can be managed,' Obama said.

Neither leader mentioned their disagreement over Syria, where China is strongly warning against the use of force.

Before his scheduled return to 
Washington late Friday, Obama was to meet with French President Francois
 Hollande, his strongest ally on Syria and a vocal advocate for a 
military intervention. He also planned to meet with Russian lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender activists, calling attention to another 
area of disagreement with Moscow.

Britain announced yesterday that scientists at the Porton Down research laboratories have found traces of the nerve gas sarin on cloth and soil samples retrieved from the site of the attack.

Meanwhile, there were signs that Mr Obama may struggle to secure support in Congress for his proposal of 'limited and proportionate' military action against Assad.

A poll commissioned by the BBC and ABC News suggested more than one-third of Congress members were undecided whether or not to back military action, while a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the President.

The survey found that 226 members of the House of Representatives said they would oppose or were likely to oppose military action, against 45 who were certain or likely to support it and 189 who were undecided or did not respond.

Some 17 members of the Senate were certain or likely to oppose Mr Obama's plans, against 23 certain or likely to back him and 60 whose position was undecided or unknown.
