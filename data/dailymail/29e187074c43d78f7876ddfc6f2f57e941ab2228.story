Forget Sydney's beaches and harbour or Melbourne's pubs and cafes, because the nation's best place to live and work is our often mocked national capital.

That's based on data from one of the world's most respected economic bodies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, using a 'well-being' index that compares factors such as the environment, income and health and safety of citizens in 362 regions around the world.

The territory received three top 10 scores, more than any other region included on the list, for safety, income and civic engagement. Even its lowest score, for the environment, was still a massive 9.1. Of all the eight indicators, Canberra total score was 77.7 out of a possible 80.

While living conditions in Canberra might be top class, it has built up a reputation as a boring city with little to do

Canberra is truly the place to visit all-year round. During summer it's dry and desolate while in the winter months it is one of the coldest places in the country

As the political heartland of the country, Canberra, along with six other of our state's and territories received top score of 10 for its civic engagement - meaning Australia is more in tune with its political system than just about anywhere else.

The high number of voter engagement, about 95 per cent, was taken from the 2013 Federal Election and largely reflects the fact that voting in Australia is mandatory.  Australia had the highest average voter turnout of any other region based on the previous national election. Voter turnout is defined as the ratio between the number of voters to the number of persons with voting rights.

The statistics also confirmed the capital has a higher average income than the 360 regions identified, and it terms of its murder rate - that's practically non existent. Canberra has the lowest murder rate across Australia averaging just one in 100,000 people.

It's commonly confused that Sydney, and not Canberra, is referred to as Australia's capital city.

Despite its knockers, Canberra seems to be making its place on the world stage.

A New York Times article recently told its readers that while it does not compare to the 'glitzier city of Sydney' and  'there are no beaches or iconic opera houses' it does have 'big-sky beauty, breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly.'

The best way to enjoy Canberra, the Times said, is 'with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur-crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas.'

Unlike most cities, Canberra was purposefully built as the nation's capital and the road network is built with an incredibly high number of roundabouts

Income 10/10

Safety 10/10

Civic Engagement 10/10

Health 9.9/10

Accessibility to services 9.6/10

Jobs 9.6/10

Environment 9.5/10

Education 9.1/10

It also recommended going for a bicycle ride which loops one of the capital's premier attractions, it's lake. But it isn't just any lake, it was named after Chicago man, Walter Burley Griffin, who designed the capital built in the centre of Melbourne and Sydney.

Tasmania's score for education is 5.6, putting it in the bottom 27 per cent of the OECD regions. The ACT is high on the list, in the top 19 per cent, but when it comes to the country's natural environment, look no further than Tasmania, NSW and QLD which all score a perfect 10 out of 10.

The Northern Territory doesn't fare quite as well as its neighbouring state's and territories, scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for safety.Its health score is in the OECD's bottom 29 per cent, while its safety score is in the bottom 13 per cent.

Canberra and the ACT can count itself a lucky place to live, with a higher average income, civic engagement and better safety than some of the 300 regions on the OECD list

The war museum in Canberra, it was revealed recently, was Australia's number one tourist attraction

Lake Burley Griffin was named in honour of Water Burley Griffin, the Chicago-born architect which designed the capital city from scratch

Tasmania, along with Queensland and NSW, scored 10 out of 10 in the environment category

The Northern Territory doesn't fare quite as well as its neighboring states and territories, scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for safety
