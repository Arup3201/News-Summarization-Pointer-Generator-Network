Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured) yesterday warned against a premature rise in interest rates

Vince Cable yesterday warned against a premature rise in interest rates.

The Business Secretary sounded the alarm about homebuyers who are being lent mortgages equal to ‘five times’ their salary.

An outspoken critic of Britain’s banks, Mr Cable questioned whether such super-size loans were ‘sensible’.

He warned that the overheating housing market could lead to a premature rise in interest rates which would jeopardise the recovery.

Mr Cable said: ‘There is a risk that the destabilising effects of the rise in house prices, certainly in London and the South East, potentially has a major impact on the economy as a whole.

‘If, for example, interest rates were to rise sooner than they otherwise would have done on the basis of the overall position of the economy, then this potentially is a negative consequence of the imbalance that is happening.’

His comments came as the Bank of England gave its strongest signal yet that interest rates will rise before the end of the year – pushing up mortgage costs of millions of families.

Mr Cable said a home loan which is five times bigger than a worker’s salary ‘must raise all kinds of questions about whether this is sensible for lenders and sensible for borrowers’.

Mr Cable said the ‘traditional’ model was to lend around three to 3.5 times’ somebody’s salary.

Speaking in London yesterday at the headquarters of Bloomberg, the financial newswire, he said: ‘What is going on here?’

The Office for National Statistics this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in London over the last year. This is the second fastest rise in house prices in the capital since its records began, and means the average London home now costs nearly £500,000.

Mr Cable said his views were not just ‘a personal prejudice’, and cited the recent warning by the International Monetary Fund.

Recently, it said some buyers are ‘at risk of borrowing more than they can afford to pay’, he said.

In Mr Cable’s constituency of Twickenham, the average person who lives in the leafy London borough and works full-time in the area earns £33,000.

But the average house price is nearly £595,000, according to the property website Zoopla.

If they want to buy a house, they would need to borrow a mortgage which is 18 times bigger than their salary.

Last week, the Bank of England governor also raised his concerns that the mortgage market is ‘becoming more lax’, less than two months since new rules were meant to make it safer.

Around four in ten people who have taken out a mortgage recently are borrowing a loan which is ‘at least’ 3.5 times their salary, which is an all-time high.

One in ten borrowed ‘at least’ 4.5 times their salary. For example, this means if they earn £50,000, they are borrowing more than £225,000.

The worry is that people are taking out loans that they can afford when interest rates are low, but not when they inevitably go up.

More than one million people have bought their first home since 2007, the last time that interest rates were increased in this country.

There are fears of the ‘interest rate shock’ that will hit them because they have never experienced an increase in the cost of their mortgage.

Warning: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that the first increase in Bank Rate since 2007 'could happen sooner than markets currently expect'

The Bank yesterday hinted that rates will rise before the end of the year having been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009.

Officials on the panel that sets rates said it was ‘somewhat surprising’ that a hike in 2014 was not more widely expected.

The comments followed last week’s warning from Governor Mark Carney that the first increase in Bank Rate since 2007 ‘could happen sooner than markets currently expect’.

Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The risk of 2014 hike is clearly growing.’

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘Clearly savers will be cheered by the rewards that higher interest rates will bring but the big unknown is how households will react to the prospect of more expensive mortgages.

‘If consumer spending falls as higher mortgage costs eat into disposable incomes the wider economic recovery could be in jeopardy.’

All nine members of the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee voted to hold rates at 0.5 per cent this month, according to minutes of the meeting published yesterday.

But the report showed that for some the decision ‘had become more balanced in the past couple of months than earlier in the year’ – suggesting at least one official is close to breaking ranks.

The minutes said: ‘The economy was starting to return to normal. Part of that normalisation would be a rise in Bank Rate at some point.’

The Bank added that ‘it still seemed likely that when Bank Rate began to rise it would do so gradually and to a level below its pre-crisis average rate’ of around 5 per cent.
