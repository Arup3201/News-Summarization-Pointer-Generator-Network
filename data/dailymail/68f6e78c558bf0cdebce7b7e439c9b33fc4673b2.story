More than 80 children have suffered appalling abuse after being branded as witches in a crimewave fuelled by medieval beliefs imported from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.

The scale of the problem – with many youngsters being beaten, starved and kept in cages – was revealed as a football coach was found guilty of torturing a boy to death.

Eric Bikubi, 28, faces life in prison after murdering 15-year-old Kristy Bamu in a four-day orgy of almost unimaginable violence.

Scene of the crime: Kristy was forced to pray for deliverance for four days and deprived of food and water

Eric Bikubi is facing a potential life sentence following the guilty verdict

Over the past decade, Scotland Yard has 
recorded 83 cases of children suffering barbaric treatment, including 
bizarre exorcism rituals. But detectives fear there may be hundreds of 
other young victims.

Bikubi was in the grip of a lifetime obsession with kindoki, or 
witchcraft, and believed he had special powers to detect evil.

His 
girlfriend, former Marks & Spencer worker Magalie Bamu, 29, the 
victim’s eldest sister, was also convicted of murder at the Old Bailey.

Kristy suffered 130 injuries as he was attacked with weapons including a
 metal bar, hammer, chisel, pliers and even heavy ceramic floor tiles.

He drowned in a bath on Christmas Day 2010 in front of his four 
terrified siblings as Bikubi hosed them down with freezing water in an 
abhorrent ‘cleansing’ ritual.

The murder took place just nine days after a woman disembowelled her 
four-year-old daughter as a sacrifice because she believed the child was
 possessed.

Shayma Ali, who was later detained indefinitely in a mental hospital, 
was obsessed with evil spirits and had removed all the eyes from the 
little girl’s toys.

Both cases, which took place just a few miles apart in East London, 
shocked detectives. They warned the number of cases linked to witchcraft
 is growing but the beliefs behind them remain little understood.

In court: Kelly Bamu, pictured on the witness stand, said Kristy asked for forgiveness. 'He asked again and again,' she said, adding 'Magalie did absolutely nothing. She didn't give a damn'

Terrible death: Kristy's last words were 'I just want to die now' before he slipped underneath the water in the bath

Officials suspect grotesque acts continue to thrive behind closed doors,
 fuelled by a toxic combination of extreme evangelical Christianity and 
traditional beliefs.

In some of the most serious cases police suspect children may have been 
sent to their native countries where they face torture, sexual abuse and
 even murder.

Scotland Yard is overhauling its specialist religious and cultural abuse
 unit, Project Violet, to better focus on the dark practices.

Senior 
officers are worried the abuse has slipped down the agenda since the 
death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie in 2000 at the hands of her 
aunt who branded her a witch.

Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe said the crimes were almost 
certainly ‘far more prevalent’ than official figures suggest.

He said: 
‘Children have been physically beaten and forced to drink unknown 
liquids in rituals to rid them of evil spirits. They have been starved 
or deprived of sleep. They have had liquids poured on their genitals and
 been murdered.’

Kristy was killed as a Christmas trip with his two sisters and two 
brothers, aged between 11 and 22, from their home in Paris, descended 
into a nightmare.

The siblings stayed with Bikubi and Bamu at an eighth-floor  council 
flat in Manor Park, East London, which the pair had recently moved 
into.

Violent evidence: Kristy Bamu suffered 130 injuries after being tortured for four days with weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles

Witchcraft: These weapons were found at the scene in what officers called an 'unprecedented scenario'

Evidence: Officers found a whole array of weapons in the flat, including pliers, a pole, and a piece of wood

The horror for the family began when Bikubi unleashed a prolonged attack
 after Kristy wet himself, an act linked by some to witchcraft.

The heavily-built sportsman accused the teenager of trying to control 
another child in the house and of orchestrating a series of unlucky 
events.

Four days of abuse: Items found in the flat had been used as 'weapons of torture'

He punched, kicked and headbutted his victim before beating him with a 
metal weight-lifting bar ‘as hard as he could’ and knocking out his 
teeth with a hammer.

In one act of savage cruelty, as Kristy’s siblings 
were hit, forced to join in and help clear the blood, Bamu ripped apart 
one of his ears with a pair of pliers.

Five hours of desperate phone calls were made to Kristy’s parents in 
Paris but at first they did not believe their children and were then 
unable to travel because of the Christmas break.

On Christmas Day, with his face beaten to a barely recognisable pulp, 
Kristy was thrown into a bath.

His last words were ‘I just want to die 
now’ before slipping underneath the water. Bikubi, an unemployed failed 
football agent, said his ‘battle against witchcraft’ began in earnest 
when he travelled to Britain to escape civil war in his native Congo 
aged seven or eight.

His defence team argued he was suffering a mental disorder, but an 
expert told the court he was ‘calm, lucid and rational’ when he murdered
 Kristy.

Speaking after the trial, the victim’s father said Bikubi 
showed less compassion to his son than a butcher would show a cow in an 
abattoir.

Mr Bamu said: ‘I had so much pain in my heart that I can’t 
express it.’

Bikubi and Bamu will be sentenced on Monday.

Christian fundamentalist pastors in Britain are fuelling the belief in witchcraft, experts warned yesterday.

Dr Richard Hoskins, a police adviser, said he has spoken to many immigrant Londoners gripped by the potential power of malicious ‘spirits’ threatening to damage their families.

Traditional methods of exorcism include wearing a charm, fasting or sacrificing an animal and are controlled by the Church.

The university lecturer warned that Christian extremists and evangelists have begun taking advantage of vulnerable families and perpetuating beliefs in witchcraft by offering expensive ‘deliverance services’.

Dr Hoskins said: ‘What seems to happen is that there is this dislocation and, in this case, something feral and wild. It is completely out of control.’

The issue was first highlighted by the case of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie in 2000. Victoria, who travelled to Britain from the Ivory Coast, died at the hands of her aunt and her boyfriend after being branded a witch.

A year later the torso of a Nigerian boy, named Adam by police, was found in the Thames after he was ritually sacrificed. 

Police believe he may have been killed by someone with a terminal illness who believed his murder would save them.

In 2005, three people were convicted of beating, cutting and rubbing chilli peppers in the eyes of an eight-year-old Angolan girl to ‘beat the devil out of her’.
