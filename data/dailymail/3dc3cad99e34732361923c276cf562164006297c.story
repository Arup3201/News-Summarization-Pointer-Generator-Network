The final whistle would normally cue screams of celebration.

But today's inaugural Miami Beach Brawl ended in a mass fight between the victorious Memphis Tigers and notoriously straight-laced BYU Cougars.

Dozens of players on both sides were seen dealing physical blows, with some even wielding helmets as weapons. 

It has been an embarrassment for Brigham Young University's college team, which is grappling to wedge itself into the upper echelons of league football - while promoting the school's Mormon values.

Brawl! The field was flooded with Memphis and BYU players in a bloody fight as the final whistle blew

Bloodied: BYU player Kai Nacua is facing expulsion after he was caught on camera punching an opponent

The Memphis Tigers had just scored their first win in nine years, defeating the BYU Cougars 55-48.

But Christian Stewart, on the losing side, closed the game by throwing an interception.

And havoc ensued.

The Tigers' Chase Johnson was caught on camera swinging his helmet into the head BYU center Tejan Koroma - who was fighting off four other opponents.

Meanwhile BYU defensive Kai Nacua could be seen punching the back of an opponent's head, and now faces expulsion.

Around them, players on both teams' benches descended on the field and piled on top of each other.

The coaches can be seen trying to restrain anyone they come into contact with - to no avail.

Escalated: It was a violent conclusion to the tense and exhilarating game, which Memphis won 55-48

 

It was a bloody conclusion to what had been an exhilarating and tense contest.

Paxton Lynch, a Memphis quarterback, scored four touchdowns, went for another three and passed for more than 300 yards.

BYU's Stewart threw for 349 yards and three touchdowns. 

Tom Holmoe, BYU athletics director, tweeted an apology: 'We expect better of our athletes, even in the face of a difficult loss. We intend to fully review this matter. I apologize to Cougar Nation.'

The outburst prompted a slew of Twitter reaction and opinion columns in Salt Lake City, Utah, near where BYU is located.

The Salt Lake Tribune's Gordon Monson wrote: 'It was sad. It was pathetic.' 

'Totally disgusted with the BYU players complete lack of class,' one tweet read.

Another user referenced the school's Honor Code, which - if violated - can warrant expulsion: 'BYU... Honor Code violation?'
