Arsenal and Manchester City could not be separated in a highly entertaining four-goal thriller at the Emirates Stadium.

Premier League champions Manchester City scored with just seven minutes on the clock to come away from north London with a point. 

Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players.

Jack Wilshere scored a neat chip past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in the 63rd minute

ARSENAL (4-1-4-1) 

WOJCIECH SZCZESNY: Some reasonable saves, notably one from Silva before half-time but unable to exude authority when Arsenal really needed him to. 6.

MATHIEU DEBUCHY: Better going forward than in defence. Suffered a nasty twisted ankle near the end which may rule him out for some time.

PER MERTESACKER: Rarely pretty but he and Koscielny managed to contain City for long periods. As captain and defensive leader will be disappointed to concede second from a set-piece. 6.5.

Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker struggled to get to grips with Manchester City's Sergio Aguero

LAURENT KOSCIELNY: Read the game well and made important blocks and interceptions. Hit his own post in stoppage time. 7.

NACHO MONREAL: Defensively frail, not helped with Ozil ahead of him. City were ever dangerous when breaking down his side. Booked. 6.

MATHIEU FLAMINI: Beaten by Aguero in build-up to the opening goal. Strong and aggressive without the assurance of Arteta. Booked. 6.  

JACK WILSHERE: Dragged Arsenal back into the game with aggression and spirit. Splendid first goal and key role in the second, but lucky to escape two wild kicks and a handball in his penalty box.8.

AARON RAMSEY: Seemed jaded by his recent standards and off the pace, perhaps the result of his ankle injury playing for Wales in Andorra. Quality slipped. 6.

ALEXIS SANCHEZ: Excellent on the ball. Full of energy, power and flashes of skill. Sublime volley for Arsenal’s second. Booked for ripping shirt off. 7.

MESUT OZIL: started left, moved to the right, ineffective in either position and his defensive limitations are exposed when asked to play wide. 5.5.

DANNY WELBECK: Positive first half. Good simple link-up with those around him. Struck the post post with a cool chipped finished, but he should’ve scored. Suffered cramps and faded late on. 6.5.

Danny Welbeck missed a golden chance to open his Arsenal account on his debut

SUBS: Chambers (for Debuchy 81), Oxlade-Chamberlain (for Welbeck 88), Arteta (for Flamini 95).

NOT USED: Ospina, Gibbs, Cazorla, Podolski. 

ARSENE WENGER: Happy with the draw after last season’s problems against the big teams and with the offensive power from his team. Showed enough character to haul themselves back into it when they seemed ready to overwhelmed. Unable to close the game out and ultimately left to cling on for the draw. 6.5.

MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-1-1) 

JOE HART: Coped well in a busy first 30 minutes. Clean hands and decent saves but beaten twice too easily for the goals. 6.

PABLO ZABALETA: Reliably strong in defence and capable in attack. Great challenge thwarted Welbeck early in second half. Booked. 7.

VINCENT KOMPANY: Imposing physical presence and soothing figure of authority for all but the 11-minute spell when Arsenal scored twice. 7.5.

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany remains a vital component in Manuel Pellegrini's team

MARTIN DEMICHELIS: So much more plausible with shorter hair. Made mistakes, beaten regularly by Welbeck in the air. Made amends with a vital equaliser with header from corner.6.

GAEL CLICHY: Sharp in tackle, quick to break forward and even went close to a rare goal. A return to the Emirates to be proud of. 7.

JESUS NAVAS: Showed his pace and intelligent cross for Aguero’s goal. City will regret not getting him on the ball more. 6.5.

FERNANDINHO: Often careless in possession but a destructive force who swarmed and smothered Arsenal’s creative unit. Booked. 6.

FRANK LAMPARD: Fleeting reminders of passing range but heavy-footed in comparison to all else around him and replace at half-time. Booked. 5.

JAMES MILNER: First half on the left, second half in the centre. Industrious and combative in both roles. 6.

DAVID SILVA: Sophisticated and inventive on the ball as usual, but for one horribly stray pass almost let in Welbeck. 6.5.

SERGIO AGUERO: Robust and well-balanced. Opened scoring with a neat finish. Arsenal will have been relieved to see him go off. Booked. 7.

Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scored the opening goal of the game after 28 minutes

SUBS: Nasri (for Lampard 46) goal disallowed 7. Dzeko (for Aguero 67) good chance late on 6. Kolarov (for Fernandinho 77) hit post.

NOT USED: Caballero, Mangala, Sagna, Sinclair.

MANUEL PELLEGRINI: Angrily blamed the referee for more dropped points. His team were strong at the back under pressure from Arsenal, and sought to do their damage on the break. Nasri for Lampard gave City more attacking verve but decision to take off Aguero was odd. His team has maturity and know-how and were pressing for the winner at the end. 6.5.

REFEREE: Mark Clattenburg: Both managers had their complaints but not an easy game to control. Tried to let it flow and helped contribute to the entertainment. 6.
