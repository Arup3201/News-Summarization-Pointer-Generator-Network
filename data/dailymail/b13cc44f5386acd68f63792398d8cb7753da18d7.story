Defendant: Steven Orloff, pictured, a former official at a Boston school district is accused of posing as a 14-year-old boy online to lure teenage girls into webcam strip shows and abusing his foster daughter

A former official at a Boston school district is accused of posing as a 14-year-old boy online to lure teenage girls into webcam strip shows.

Steven Orloff, 48, who worked as director of student services for Stoneham Schools, is also in the center of a civil lawsuit alleging he sexually abused and secretly filmed an already traumatized girl in his bathroom while he was her foster father.

He is due in federal court in Boston today to answer criminal charges of producing child pornography, after the Department of Children's and Families stalled on the case for eight months and the alleged pedophile was released on bail.

Orloff first came to the attention of police in July 2012, when the mother of a 15-year-old girl in Cumberland, Maine, found her daughter had sent pictures of her genitals to a boy named 'Jason Jaffe' of Sudbury.

According to the Boston Herald, Cumberland County officials alerted Framingham police and detectives determined Orloff was Jaffe before searching his Framingham home in December 2012.

They seized laptops and hard drives that were filled with pornographic images of eight girls. 

Among those girls was the traumatized teen in his custody, who was filmed using a camera inside a fake plant that was pointed at the shower, police said.

'The defendant's face is visible on several of these videos, as the camera was recording while he was setting it up,' prosecutors wrote in court documents. Orloff's attorney suggested the camera was used to monitor the girl's hygiene habits.

Orloff was arrested over a year ago - on December 12, 2012, - and resigned from his position at the school district in January.

Later that month, the Department of Children and Families notified the foster child's biological mother of the 'recent' sexual abuse allegations against Orloff.

In April, attorney Christopher Hug 
filed a lawsuit in Suffolk County Court on behalf of the teen, alleging 
DCF failed to properly vet Orloff, failed to do mandatory checks on his 
home and kept the already fragile girl in a 'dangerous and unstable' 
foster home.

The failures, he claimed, resulted in the girl suffering abuse at the hands of Orloff from April 2010 to December 2011.

'They
 failed her,' the teen's mother, who regained custody of the girl this 
year, told the Herald. 'They took a kid that was already victimized once
 and victimized her again and again and again. She can't take care of 
herself. Life is very difficult for her.'

The Herald reported that in February and March, a grand jury returned two separate indictments charging Orloff with a combined three counts of possession of child pornography, two counts of secretly photographing and videotaping a person in the nude, and one count of posing a child in a state of sexual conduct.

On March 15, he was released on $50,000 and $20,000 bail for the two state cases, but then progess on the case seemed to grind to a halt.

Frustrated by the lack of action, on December 2, Hug made another filing, this time suing for $75,000 and noting DCF had failed to respond to the previous suit.

Two weeks later, on December 13, Orloff was charged with preying on girls across several states between March and August 2012, using the name 'Jason Jaffe' and tricking them into stripping on webcams. 

The abused teen is now a senior in high school and suffers post-traumatic stress disorder as well as other physical conditions, the latest lawsuit states.

'They have no business doing this if they can't do this properly,' the mother told the Herald. 'Someone really needs to look at this, the way they're treating these kids.'

The girl now lives in a on-bedroom apartment with her mother, older sister and her mother's roommate.

DCF officials refused to comment on the specifics of the case but defended its screening process. 'Our top goal is to ensure that all of the children being supported by DCF, whether it is at home or in foster care, are safe and well cared for,' a spokeswoman said.
