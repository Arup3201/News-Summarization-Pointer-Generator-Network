En route? Manager Pearson confirmed talks have progressed with the former Inter Milan midfielder Cambiasso

BORN: Argentina, August 18 1980 (age 34)

Playing position: Central midfielder

1998-2001: Independiente (98 apps, 14 gls)

2001-2002: River Plate (37, 12)

2002-2004: Real Madrid (41, 0)

2004-2014: Inter Milan (315, 41)

2000-2011: Argentina (52, 5) 

He is available after leaving Inter following 10 years at the San Siro and Pearson remains upbeat over the deal.

Pearson said: 'Cambiasso is still a possibility. There's been progress over the weekend so I'm more hopeful than I was on Friday and Saturday but until there is a definitive answer I'm loath to talk too much. But I am hopeful it can be done in next couple of days.

'We've been trying to do business and it has not materialised so far. But hopefully this week we can still do business and bring players in we want to bring in.

'I recognise there is a need for added numbers and we have to do that in this window. There are subtle differences this year to last year.

'We've been very positive but it is nice to have different options. Two or three hopefully is the aim. It would be nice to be able to achieve that.'

Leicester host Shrewsbury, where Pearson started his career, in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday without Danny Drinkwater (hamstring), Jamie Vardy (thigh) and Matty James (shin).

Pearson added: 'Danny will be introduced back into training this week so maybe available for the week. Matty's shin is still sore so we will have to take that one at the right pace especially with a break coming up.' 

'A possibility': Cambiasso has been locked in talks with Leicester after leaving Inter Milan over the summer

Premier League bound? It would see Cambiasso make his mark in England for the first time in his career
