The return of the ‘Archbishop of Banterbury’ could be a blessing for England, as James Haskell will take his place in an overhauled team on Saturday, full of intent and armed with a useful dose of perspective.

As captain of Wasps this season, the flanker has proved he is a man of consistent substance to go with the larger-than-life persona. Now he has overcome a virus, initially feared to be meningitis, the 29-year-old is determined to inspire England as they seek to halt a sequence of five defeats.

Haskell, one of three changes to the matchday squad for the QBE Test against at Twickenham, can add an edge to Stuart Lancaster’s team. This is a player who can talk the talk, but he has also been regularly walking the walk of late with a strong end to last season, a fine contribution to the gallant near-miss against the All Blacks in Auckland and a stirring start to the new club campaign.

Having been a frustrated observer in the last two weeks, as England have sunk to home defeats against New Zealand and South Africa, Haskell is ready to enter the fray with a clear vision of what is required. Results - nothing else.

‘It’s important for us to get results on the board,’ he said. ‘That’s the key. We don’t feel in crisis but ultimately what cements everything we’re doing is results. No one reflects in a year’s time and says, “Oh, that was a narrow victory”, they just want to see a W. As for the idea that, “Win or lose, they’ve got a really good culture”, frankly, it doesn’t matter.

‘With all the fans that have bought into everything we’re trying to do, you want to do them justice, you want to do yourselves justice, and you want to confirm that everything we’re doing inside the camp is correct. We all know it is; it’s now just getting over the line and proving it.’

Haskell replaces Billy Vunipola, while Richard Wigglesworth and Billy Twelvetrees have come in for Danny Care and Kyle Eastmond. Reflecting on the defeats by the All Blacks and Springboks that have set off a wave of criticism, Haskell added: ‘I have been involved when we were getting beaten heavily by these sides, when a narrow loss would have been acceptable.

‘It is now at the stage where we should be beating these teams and be right up there. I don’t think anyone is satisfied to be pushing those teams close. We should be beating them and we are doing everything in our power to go on and do that.’

But Haskell insisted the present problems bear no resemblance to the debacle at the last World Cup, which he was involved in. ‘It is the polar opposite,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t resemble that kind of atmosphere or situation at all.

‘My own view and that of the boys is that finishing an honourable second is not acceptable but let’s get some context here. It was the world champions and the second-best team in the world. No one wants to talk about a development journey, but we are a side that has come together pretty quickly.

‘We have pushed some very good sides close but we are aware that we need to take that step next and take those opportunities.

‘We are talking about small percentages - that ruthlessness that New Zealand or the South Africans have which has been born out of a lot of experience and a lot of games together with pretty unchanged squads. They are doing it consistently and that’s what we are striving for.’

That is also what Haskell has been striving for on a personal level. He achieved that impressive continuity prior to his virus-induced week in hospital and he has done enough since his comeback to convince the coaches that he deserves another starting shot. His ambition is to maximise the opportunity and that is where deeds must trump words.

‘You never want to be the guy who talks it up; who trains like Tarzan, plays like Jane,’ he said. ‘If you talk a good game, you have to play a good game. This is a huge opportunity for me and I want to seize it as best I can. I want to make sure I perform and leave nothing in the tank. There is never next week with international rugby because it is so competitive. That is my mind-set.’

Haskell’s hope is to ‘make life difficult’ for the coaches by playing well enough to leave them with a selection quandary. But in doing so, he would also be making life much easier by alleviating the pressure which has engulfed the England set-up. That would be a blessing for all involved.
