A woman arrived home to find that her husband had tied up a naked teenage man in the living room of the family home, a court has heard.

Joanne O'Connor said she discovered the bizarre scene after she returned home early from work one day last year.

Her husband John Young, a radio DJ, then assaulted her and grabbed her hair, and has now been fined £300 for the attack.

Row: John Young fought his wife after she found a naked 18-year-old man tied up in the family home

Ms O'Connor, 48, told Kilmarnock Sheriff Court: 'I knew our marriage was in trouble when I found an 18-year-old boy naked and bound in the living room.'

The court heard that Young, 49, then smashed up his own collection of CDs during the ensuing row in Kilwinning, Ayrshire, the Evening Times reported.

An antique clock which was a family heirloom was also damaged in the fight.

The couple's daughter went into the room and said: 'What are you arguing about now?'

Young denied assaulting and injuring his wife by grabbing her hair and chest.

He told the court that he has since come out as gay, but claimed that Ms O'Connor accused him of being a paedophile.

The DJ said that if he had attacked his wife she would have hit him back.

Sheriff Brian Murphy found Young guilty of assault, and ordered him to pay a £300 fine.

He could also lose his new job with North Ayrshire Council.

Young, who uses the professional name Ian Young, helped to set up Irvine Beat FM, but has now left the station.
