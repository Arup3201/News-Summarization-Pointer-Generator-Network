A mother shot and killed her two sons, her ex-husband and her stepmother - then tried to make it look like her son was the killer, police said.

Susan Hendricks, 48, of Pickens County, South Carolina, allegedly wanted to collect life insurance policies on all of the victims.

She was in one of two homes where the shootings took place and told police her youngest son had been using drugs and was suicidal.

Officers found a gun by his body, and Hendricks said he left her a note on the kitchen table. But investigators said on Tuesday it was all staged.

Matthew Hendricks, 23, was found dead in 
bed. Her stepmother Linda Ann Burns, 64, was found dead inside another 
bedroom in her home.

Next door authorities found her ex-husband Mark Hendricks, 52, and her other son, Marshall Wayne Hendricks, 20. Both were shot in the chest.

The homes are about five miles outside Liberty, in an area of mixed farms and suburban residences in the state's west.

‘Her statements were inconsistent with the scientific and forensic evidence,’ Greenville County Solicitor Walt Wilkins said.

Prosecutors would not say how much insurance she had on the victims, but it was a large amount. This isn't the first deadly shooting at her home.

Doyle ‘Brian’ Teague, 36, was shot to death in April 2006 after entering the house uninvited and threatening someone inside, the coroner's office said.

‘In a case of this magnitude, but where 
there appears to be no significant risk to the public and the suspect 
can be readily monitored, prudence dictates that sufficient forensic 
tests be done prior to an arrest being made'

Investigators ruled at the time she acted in self-defence.

'In a case of this magnitude, but where there appears to be no significant risk to the public and the suspect can be readily monitored, prudence dictates that sufficient forensic tests be done prior to an arrest being made,' he said.

She was arrested on Monday night and charged with four counts of murder. It wasn't immediately clear if she had an attorney.
