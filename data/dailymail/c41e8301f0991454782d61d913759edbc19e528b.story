They have been the best team in the world for half a decade and even have the World Cup trophy to reflect their dominance in rugby union.

But there is no rest for the wicked, and ahead of a clash with Wales at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, New Zealand are back in the gym and hitting the weights, the cardio machines and even the yoga mats as they look to record a hat-trick of wins over Home Nation outfits.

The All Blacks have already beaten England 24-21 at Twickenham earlier this month, while Scotland were also put to the sword at Murrayfield on Saturday with a 24-16 victory.

The dust had not even settled from the Scotland triumph with Steve Hansen's team straight to work with a morning gym session at the Cardiff University Strength and Conditioning Centre.

The likes of Joe Moody were among those hitting the heavyweights as the prop took to bench pressing, while fly-halfs Dan Carter and Colin Slade opted for an endurance workout as they took on the cycling machines.

Just to prove how strong the All Blacks are in all areas, even Sonny Bill Williams was improving his flexibility with stretches on the yoga mats.

But not all of New Zealand's stars looked like bullet proof unbeatable athletes during the session, with Owen Franks seemingly more daunted by a spot of cycling than he has from what the Home Nations have offered him on the pitch so far.
