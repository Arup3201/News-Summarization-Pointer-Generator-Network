Derby County may have introduced a no-swearing protocol, but Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe must surely have had a few expletives running through his mind, if not passing his lips, as his side twice squandered the lead in their top-of-the-table draw.

Bournemouth dropped to second and Derby third as both sides missed the chance to move three points clear - allowing Middlesbrough to go top with a 2-1 win at Blackpool - as Tom Ince cancelled out Matt Ritchie’s opener and Darren Bent equalised after Callum Wilson sent the home side ahead again.

Derby manager Steve McClaren wants his players and staff to stop swearing to concentrate them in matches, but in one so frenetic that is no mean feat.

Did they manage to maintain it during this one? ’If you heard me at half-time, no,’ McClaren revealed afterwards.

This was a proper top versus second match. One between a clash of philosophies; arguably the league’s most attractive yet stringent side, Bournemouth, and the big names and spending might of Derby.

The south coast club were hosting in their 12,000 capacity Dean Court ground. If the game were at Derby’s iPro Stadium it would’ve been full to it’s 33,000 maximum.

Pure football struck first when the home side took the lead in only the 12th minute with a wonderfully constructed move.

Yann Kermorgant cushioned a cross from Wilson into the path of Ritchie and the midfielder took a touch before finishing from eight yards out.

Tom Ince hit a precise left-footed drive to get Derby back on level terms on the half-hour mark

Howe was priced out of a January move for Birmingham’s exciting winger Demarai Gray despite five bids and they signed no one to reinforce their promotion push.

Conversely, Derby shelled out on loan moves for Bent from Aston Villa and Hull’s Ince and it was those two who combined for their equaliser after half-an-hour.

Bent, who came on in the 15th minute when top-scorer Chris Martin hobbled off, did well down the right flank and passed to Ince. With blistering pace he beat a man before burying a left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.

But the home side scored a minute before the break, when top-scorer Wilson fired into the top left corner from a tight angle on the right.

Howe broke the bank - in Bournemouth terms - to sign Wilson for a club record £3million from Coventry last summer. That goal was the 22-year-old’s 18th of the season in all competitions.

But Derby were able to call on £65,000-per-week Bent, who has commanded almost £50m in transfer fees during his career, to fire them level from close range in the 68th minute.

Howe said: ’For me names of other teams don't scare me in the sense of where they’ve been or the sides they’ve played for. I would back my players to go toe-to-toe with anyone. We’re where we are on right.’

Bent had a half-volley saved at the near post by Artur Boruc, who also fumbled but kept out Will Hughes’ effort and Wilson twice went close in the first half.

McClaren and his players wouldn’t like to admit it out loud, but what an eff-ing game.
