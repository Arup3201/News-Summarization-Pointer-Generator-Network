A Chinese property developer is under investigation after local residents claimed the firm bullied them out of their homes by telling them that they would be infected with AIDS if they did not leave.

Authorities in the city of Nanyang in central Henan Province are carrying out the investigation to find out whether the firm hired builders with AIDS for the purpose of intimidation.

According to local media reports, the 'AIDS demolition team'  threatened local residents with infection.

AIDS? According to local media there was an 'AIDS demolition team' of builders carrying out the work and intimidating residents with threats of infection

The reports, distributed through Weibo microblogging service allegedly showed pictures of threatening red graffiti on a building wall saying 'AIDS demolition team.'

The crew claimed to have AIDS patients in their ranks and threatened people living in areas slated for demolition and development with the disease, according to agency Xinhua.

Local residents said the bullying begun in the neighborhood in 2012, with houses being illegally cut from utilities.

Ignorance: Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains rife across China despite numerous awareness campaigns in Shanghai and other large cities

HIV/AIDS is transmitted primarily through unprotected sexual intercourse including anal and oral sex, contaminated blood transfusions, from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or hypodermic needles.

HIV infection can be prevented through safe sex and needle-exchange programs.

However, there is no cure or vaccine for the disease, but antiretroviral treatment can slow the disease down.

The ‘AIDS demolition team’ allegedly had six members, who had papers confirming their diagnosis.

But authorities  have not yet established whether the papers were authentic, as the company involved has been shut down during the investigation.

In the 1990s, the Henan province faced a massive AIDS epidemic and the disease spread among local villagers, who had sold their blood for medical purposes.

The blood was often collected by  clinics with unsanitary conditions which spread the disease further. 

There is still a great deal of ignorance about how the HIV/AIDS virus is passed on in the country.
