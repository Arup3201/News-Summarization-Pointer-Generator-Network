An app that ‘sings’ your messages and sends them to other people over Facebook Messenger has been released.

Called ‘Ditty’, it converts up to 70 characters into music using auto-tune, with a variety of popular songs available in the app.

From nursery rhymes such as Hickory Dickory Dock to more contemporary music like Sia’s Chandelier, any message can be ‘musicified’ and sent to other people.

California-based Zya has released their Ditty app for Facebook Messenger. Users can type in a 70-character message and have it turned into a song. Music available includes Brave, Chandelier and Counting Stars. The iOS and Android app is free, although some songs cost 80p

The app, from California-based Zya, is free to download and available now for iOS and Android.

When a user loads up the app they are presented with a window to type messages in at the bottom of the screen, and a scrollable list of songs to choose from.

After a typing a message, a user can then preview what it will sound like with different songs before sending it over Facebook messenger.

The messages are converted into 20-second music clips, displayed in a text-based music video, and the words of the message are then sung in tune to the song.

It works by matching up the syllable count of a message with the lyrics of a song.

While some of the dozens of songs on the service are free, most such as ‘Counting Stars’ and ‘The Gambler’ require payment of £0.80 ($0.99).

Once a song is bought, it is stored in the user’s library and can be used as many times as they want.

Zya also said they had plans to add more songs, with a target of 100 in the next few months.

Forty different apps will be available on Messenger in the coming days, allowing users of the service to send each other sports clips and animations, Facebook said.

Another feature will allow consumers to use Messenger to send a text message to make a restaurant reservation or to receive a notification that a product purchased online has shipped.

The example of receiving a notification when a garage door is opened was demonstrated on-stage. 

‘Everyone loves music, but making it has always divided people into two camps - those who can and those who can’t,’ the company said in a statement.

‘Ditty changes that by making the simple act of typing a musical experience.’

'Ditty is a brand new experience that sings personal messages to the melody of famous songs and makes them shareable via Messenger.

'Users type in up to 70 characters, select a well-known track and Ditty generates a personalised lyric video to send to friends.'

The release of Ditty follows news from the F8 Developer Conference in San Francisco, where Facebook announced its Messenger app would be opened to third party developers.

Known as the Messenger Platform, it will allow developers to build new services into the app, which is used by 600 million users each month.

Boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would give users 'more tools for expression'.

The new Platform will give users the chance to communicate directly with businesses, for example to change an order as well as track its delivery.

Facebook's David Marcus, vice president of messaging products, took to the stage to confirm that apps like ESPN have already built apps that will now be supported in Messenger. 

Over 40 apps will be launched in the coming days, he confirmed - with Ditty being just one.

The initial kit for developers to build their software into Messenger is available now, though no general release date has yet been confirmed.

Mr Marcus also spoke of Facebook's desire to revolutionise online shopping by allowing users to receive real-time shopping updates via Messenger.
