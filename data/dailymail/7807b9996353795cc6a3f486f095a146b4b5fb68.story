UK shoppers will be able leave their wallets at home when doing the supermarket shop in the future, after Sainsbury’s and Asda joined a number of companies allowing customers to pay with their smartphones.

The two supermarkets will let shoppers pay for groceries with the Zapp mobile payments app from 2015.

Zapp was announced in January, and HSBC, First Direct, Nationwide, Santander and Metro Bank have already signed up to offer Zapp mobile payments to 18 million customers across the UK.

Now a new tranche of companies including House of Fraser Shop Direct, Thomas Cook, Clarks and Oxfam have pledged to let their customers use Zapp to pay.

The company says the retailers' commitment is proof that the mobile payment revolution is at last taking off and will deliver improvements in security, convenience and speed, while ‘checking out’ both online and in-store.

Consumers should be able to start using the app next year on iOS, Android and Windows Phone handsets. It will be rolled out gradually and customers will be alerted by their banks when it becomes available.

Zapp will be integrated into a mobile banking application. Bank customers will be able to see their balances on each account, and choose which one to pay from.

When customers reach the checkout of a shop that accepts Zapp payments, they will have a special code sent to their mobile phone.

Alternatively, customers will be able to scan a code into the handset from a bill in a restaurant or the screen on a card machine.

The code will contain all the information about the transaction including the price, the retailer's details and information about the items being purchased. These will appear on the customer's mobile screen.

Once a customer has then logged into the mobile banking app they will then confirm or reject the transaction with a tap of the finger. Zapp claims the whole process will take about 12 seconds.

The group of retailers and payment providers will roll out Zapp to more than 35 million people and represents the largest coalition of retailer support for a new payment method to be announced in the UK.

Zapp will compete with other payment systems when it launches, such as PayPal and Apple Pay – the forthcoming wallet service from Apple that is embedded in iPhones and the Apple Watch. At the moment, Apple Watch is only launching in the US next year and a global launch date has not yet been announced.

Rob Harper, Head of Retail Services at PayPal UK, said the well-established payment service handled $27 billion in mobile payments globally in 2013 both online and on the high street.

'PayPal has been accepted on the British high street for over three years. You can use PayPal’s smartphone app to pay at over 2,000 UK high street shops and restaurants, including GBK, Prezzo and wagamama alongside the likes of Oasis, Coast and JD Sports. 

'The PayPal app is more than a replacement for your wallet – not only can you shop on the high street but you can use it to check your spending, send money to a friend, order ahead for food or pay the bill at your table as well as take advantage of special offers at retailers,' he added.

Barclays launched a payment app called Pingit in 2012 and since then it has been downloaded 3.2 million times and responsible for £680 million of transfers, demonstrating demand for an alternative way to make payments. 

According to the Centre for Economic and Business Research (Cebr) 20 million adults will use their mobiles to pay for goods and services by the end of the decade, with the value of purchases tripling from current levels to £14.2bn ($22.8bn) in 2018.

The service will be integrated onto a mobile banking application. The customers will be able to see their balances on each account, and choose which one to pay from.

When customers reach the checkout of a shop that accepts Zapp payments, they will have a special code sent to their mobile phone. They will then confirm the transaction with a tap of the finger.

The payments work through something known as ‘digital tokens’ which means customers can keep their financial details private.

Banks claim the technology will be safer than using a debit card, as the unique code for that purchase will expire after three minutes.

Unlike chip and pin cards, Zapp will never hand over sensitive information, such as card numbers and expiry dates.

As well as this, only retailers signed up to the scheme will be able to generate the codes.

Zapp claims its app will be the biggest change in mobile payments since the introduction of the Switch card in 1988.

It will be simple for customers to use and there will be no long card numbers, new passwords and usernames to remember.

They will be able to pay for goods and services with their existing bank account, a smartphone and a mobile banking app.

Customers will be able to see their account balances at the point of purchase and choose different accounts to pay from, thereby staying more in control of their finances.

Paying with Zapp will be more secure and simple than existing methods, the company claims, because customers won’t have to reveal any of their financial details to retailers when they are shopping.

The payments system is also set to make life easier for retailers through real-time payments which will improve their cash flow.

Zapp transactions will be a fraction of the cost of cards or other alternative payment methods.

Jon Rudoe, Digital and Technology Director at Sainsbury’s, said: ‘We know that the way that our customers shop is changing and we’re always looking at new and innovative ways to improve the experience.

‘We’re one of the first retailers to sign up to Zapp to give our customers a quick, secure and convenient option to pay – both online and at the till.’

Paul Fielding, Group Treasurer of Asda said: ‘Zapp supports our long standing commitment to innovation. Our customers want to have choice, not only of what they buy but how they buy it, and Zapp will represent a fantastic addition to our payment options.’

Zapp transactions will be a fraction of the cost of cards or other alternative payment methods to make life easier for retailers. Both Sainsbury's and Tesco say they are pleased to be one of the first retailers to offer an alternative way to pay
