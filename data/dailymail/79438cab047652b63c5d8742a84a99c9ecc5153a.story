A pub diner stabbed a man in the leg with a fork when the victim took an onion ring instead of chip from the man's plate. 

Builder Mark Lawson, 44, was in The Diamond Tap public house in Newbury Berkshire for his Christmas party when he agreed that his colleague Simon Myers could take some chips from his plate. 

However, when the Mr Myers started eating an onion ring, Lawson was angered, shouted at his victim and drove the fork into his thigh.

Lawson, from Thatcham, Berkshire, admitted malicious wounding following the incident in the Weatherspoons Free House on December 19, last year. 

Reading Crown Court heard that the incident happened during a work outing over the festive period. 

Judge Alexia Durran sought clarification from defence counsel John Simmons on exactly what happened. 

Judge Durran asked: 'This was a works Christmas party and a man was stabbed in the leg for stealing onion rings from a plate, that’s right isn’t it?'

Mr Simmons replied: 'This is a very peculiar one-off offence. It may be the sort of case where the length of custodial sentence could be suspended and credit should be given for the guilty plea.'

Addressing Lawson, Judge Durran said: 'You have pleaded guilty to a serious offence of using a weapon on someone in a public place and Mr Simmons is right to say to me that this may pass the custodial threshold.

'The question is whether a prison sentence can be suspended, allowing for your guilty plea.

'Sentencing is being adjourned for a pre-sentence report. You must be back here on April 22.'

Lawson denied one count of wounding with intent and the Crown offered no evidence on that count.

Judge Durran said: 'That is a "not guilty verdict" on that count.'

The court heard that Mr Myers received treatment for a stab wound to his leg and was later allowed home from hospital.
