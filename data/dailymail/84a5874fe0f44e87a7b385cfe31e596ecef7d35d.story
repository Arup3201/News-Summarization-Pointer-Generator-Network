Floyd Mayweather Jnr has denied reports that Manny Pacquiao has signed to face him in Las Vegas on May 2, but still hopes the fight can happen.

Mayweather was courtside at the NBA All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden on Sunday amid speculation that he would chose the occasion to finally announce the £200m mega-fight.

But he insisted a deal had not been agreed during a brief interview.

'That's not true,' he said when asked about Pacquiao having signed his part of the contract. 'I haven't signed yet and he hasn't signed yet. 

'It's just been speculation and rumours, but hopefully we can make the fight happen.'

Pacquiao admitted over the weekend that Mayweather would be the one to announce the fight if a deal is finally agreed.

The pair have been negotiating since coming face to face at a basketball game in Miami last month and held face-to-face talks that evening at Pacquiao's hotel suite.
