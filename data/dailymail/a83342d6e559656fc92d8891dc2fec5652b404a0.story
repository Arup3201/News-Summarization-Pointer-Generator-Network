Hundreds of mourners have bid an emotional farewell to a California K9  who was shot and killed last month by a man wanted on weapons charges.

However none of the gatherers at the War Dog Memorial  in Riverside on Wednesday seemed to take the death of Sultan harder than deputy Mark Wallace, the police dog's partner, who was with him when he died.

'January 21 was one of the worst days of my life,' a tearful Wallace told the congregation.

'I know without a doubt Sultan saved my life and several other officer's lives that day too. He died a hero.'

Sultan took it upon himself to go after a felon who had barricaded himself inside a crawl space under a house in Hemet, California.

Todd Allen Hodge, 36, had failed to show up for his arraignment on a weapons charge and had been spotted in the neighborhood.

He ran into the house to hide. 

Sultan went in after Hodge and discovered him in the crawl space.

However Hodge shot the dog in the neck.

Sultan emerged from the space wounded and later died at the vet.

'I know if it wasn't Sultan, it would've been another dog on our team,' Wallace said at the memorial, according to KESQ News Channel 3.

'I know this because all of our dogs would've acted and done just as Sultan did that day. 

'I wouldn't want any other member of our team to go through an experience like this.

'When I got to the vet, I pulled Sultan's limp body from the back seat of my patrol car. 

'He was gone.

'They say dog's are a man's best friend. 

'Sultan wasn't man's best friend, he was my best friend.' 

Sultan Wallace were the city of San Jacinto's only police K9 team.

The standoff began around 2:30pm on January 21.

Hours later, deputies fired tear gas into the crawl space. 

Hodge later emerged holding a handgun and deputies opened fire.

Hodge died at the scene.

Sultan, a Belgian Malinois-German shepherd mix who was born in Slovakia, had been working with the department since September 2013.

He worked in narcotics detection, tracking and apprehension. 

'When I heard (SUltan had died), it felt like I'd lost a peer,' Riverside County chief deputy Geoff Raya told People. 

'There is very little differentiation between four legs and two legs – they are all members of the Riverside Sheriff's Department.'

Beloved: San Jacinto police sent Sultan into a home where a suspectwas barricaded with a gun. Sultan re-emerged from the home suffering a gunshot wound and would later die

San Jacinto Mayor Crystal Ruiz told KNBC, 'We've lost a family member, we've lost one of our own...It's heartbreaking and it's scary to think people would do something like this.'

Area residents were not evacuated during the standoff, but those who weren't home when the incident began were barred from returning for several hours.

Cornerstone Christian School, just north of the incident, was ending its class schedule at 3 p.m. when school officials were asked by officers to lock down the school.

Parents, staff and the few remaining students were on campus until deputies lifted the lockdown about two hours later.
