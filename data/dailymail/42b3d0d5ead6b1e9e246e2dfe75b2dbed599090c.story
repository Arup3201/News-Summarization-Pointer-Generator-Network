Ryan Lanza was working at his desk at the Ernst & Young when he saw TV news reports that he had killed 30 people at an elementary school in Connecticut.

It was the moment that a stunned Ryan realized what his brother Adam might have done.

Lanza quickly told his boss: 'I need to go.' He then walked out of his Times Square office, according to a co-worker who spoke to MailOnline on condition of anonymity.

Murderer: Adam Lanza who shot dead his mother and then went on a gun rampage at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut leaving 26 dead

Thirty minutes later, New York police officers stormed the office. Between leaving his place of work and being taken in for questioning, Lanza defended himself in a series of bizarre Facebook posts when he was mistakenly named as the killer after his ID was found at the scene.

Lanza, 24, seemed unaware that his younger brother, Adam Lanza, had gunned down 20 children and six adults at Sandy 
Hook Elementary School, in Newtown before taking his own life.

'Everyone shut the f*** up it wasn't me,' 
he insisted on his Facebook page on Friday. 'I'm on the bus home now it wasn't me. IT WASN'T ME I WAS AT 
WORK IT WASN'T ME.'

Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan Lanza's, told the AP that he sent Ryan a Facebook message Friday asking what was going on and if he was alright.

According to Wilshe, Lanza's reply was something along the lines of: 'It was my brother. I think my mother is dead. Oh my God.'

Questioning: Ryan Lanza is led away for questioning by police after his brother is named as the killer

Adam Lanza attended Newtown High 
School, and several local news clippings from recent years mention his 
name among the school's honor roll students.

A neighbor in Newtown, Rhonda 
Cullens, said she knew Nancy Lanza from monthly get-togethers the 
neighborhood women had for games of bunco, a dice game.
 'She was a very nice lady,' Mrs Cullens said.

'She was just like all the rest of us
 in the neighborhood, just a regular person.' Cullens recalled that 
Mrs Lanza liked gardening and decorating her house look nice for the holidays. Mrs Cullens said that Mrs Lanza joked that no one noticed because the house was out of view, up a hill.

The mix-up 
came after an official mistakenly transposed the brothers' first names, 
while a New Jersey reporter said Ryan Lanza told him the killer may have
 had his ID.

He is now being questioned by police in Hoboken, New Jersey, but police said he is not a suspect.

Adam Lanza, 20, was dressed in black military gear and a 
bullet proof vest when he opened fire in the principal's
 office and then moving to a kindergarten classroom where his mother, 
Nancy, taught.

Sources told the New York Post that
 Lanza had 'had a dispute with' his mother, who was found dead at her 
home. He then drove to the school in her car and gunned down her kindergarten 
class, Fox reported.

Lanza died of a self-inflicted gun 
wound at the scene. TheÂ Newtown Patch reported that he may have been developmentally disabled.

The Associated Press reported that Lanza's 
girlfriend and another friend are missing in New Jersey.

His father, Peter Lanza, who was divorced from Nancy, declined to comment at his home in Stamford on Friday when reporters told him about his connection to the shooting.

Police surrounded a Hoboken apartment, believed to be the home of Ryan Lanza, on Grand Street on Friday afternoon.

According to sources, Adam Lanza drove to the scene of the shootings in his mother's car and opened fire at 9.41am on Friday.

Three guns were found at the scene - a
 Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols - and a .223-caliber rifle. The 
rifle was recovered from the back of a car at the school. The two 
pistols were recovered from inside the school.

The identities of the other victims 
have not yet been released but include the school principal, Dawn 
Hochsprung, and psychologist. Two of the children died while on the way to hospital.

Robert Licata said his six-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher.

'That's
 when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door,' he 
said. 'He was very brave. He waited for his friends.'

Stephen
 Delgiadice said his eight-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and 
teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine.

'It's alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America,' he said.

A
 dispatcher at the Newtown Volunteer Ambulance Corps said a teacher had 
been shot in the foot and taken to Danbury Hospital.

Andrea Rynn, a 
spokeswoman at the hospital, said it had three patients from the school 
but she did not have information on the extent or nature of their 
injuries.

Questions: The killer opened fire in Newtown, Connecticut and his brother is being quizzed in New Jersey

Mergim Bajraliu, 17, heard the gunshots echo from his home and raced to check on his 9-year-old sister at the school. He said his sister, who was fine, heard a scream come over the intercom at one point. He said teachers were shaking and crying as they came out of the building.

'Everyone was just traumatized,' he said.

The shooting is the latest in a series 
of high-profile gun crimes in American schools and colleges, that is 
especially shocking given the age of the students involved.
