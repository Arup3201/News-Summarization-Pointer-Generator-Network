Vinnie Jones said his native England is 'past its sell-by date' and claims immigration has made it an unrecognisable 'European country'

His journey from tough-tackling footballer to movie hard man has taken him from Watford to Los Angeles.

And Vinnie Jones has revealed he has no plans to return to England any time soon, saying immigration has turned us into a completely unrecognisable ‘European country’.

The 48-year-old actor said he has to remind himself of home by importing boxes of Walkers crisps to the US and buying bottles of Ribena for $14 (£9) each.

He told the Radio Times: ‘There’s nothing to come back to here. To me, England is past its sell-by date.

'It’s not the country I grew up in. It’s a European country now. If someone blindfolded you and put you on a plane in LA, and you landed at Heathrow and they took it off, you wouldn’t have a clue where you were.’

The star and father of two – who once suggested he would run for election as an MP – said he was ‘not familiar’ with the policies of UKIP (UK Independence Party which is seeking Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union).

But he added: ‘I just think we should get our own house in order before we open our doors. It’s mind-boggling to me.’

Born in Watford, Mr Jones earned a reputation as a combative footballer for Wimbledon and Leeds United before achieving on-screen fame in Guy Ritchie’s gangster film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998.

Since 2000, he has lived with his wife Tanya and their daughter in a mansion in Mulholland Drive, in Hollywood. They fly a large Union flag on the front lawn.

Saying the weather in Britain is ‘depressing’, the star insisted he has all the comforts he could need in the U.S, including Premier League football on TV – although he complained ‘foreign players’ and ‘foreign managers’ are ruining the game.

Mr Jones is still the holder of the fastest-ever booking in a league match - after three seconds.

Asked
 for his thoughts on modern football and the ease with which negligible 
contact between two players can result in one rolling around in apparent
 agony, he replies: ‘Yeah, well, that rolling around, that’s the foreign
 players.

'I said it all 15 years ago, that diving would creep in and also that the England team would suffer because none of these foreign managers would buy English players.

‘It’s all happening, just like I said it would.

‘The likes of Frank Lampard and John Terry at Chelsea, English players with proper status at a club, they’re going to be like the dodo bird. Extinct.’

Asked whether he misses the British sense of humour or baked beans, he added: ‘We can get all that in LA, though you sometimes have to pay through the roof for it.

'A bottle of Ribena is $14. But I get my Walkers crisps delivered once a month. I have a box of Roast Chicken, a box of Salt and Vinegar, and a box of Monster Munch.’

He added: ‘People say you can get bored of the sunshine in LA. No, you can’t.

'I play golf six days a week, and I’ve still got my football team, the Hollywood All-Stars. Those are my two main things.’

Mr Jones, shamlessly namedrops throughout his interview and claimed he has ‘massive credibility’ in the U.S. because of his background as a professional sportsman and recalled a conversation he had with Hollywood star Nicholas Cage.

He said: ‘People say, "What’s it like working with Stallone, and all that?" But I’ll tell you something. Americans are crazy about sport. [Basketball star] Kobe Bryant is bigger than Brad Pitt.

'Even the President wants to shoot hoops with Kobe Bryant…Nic Cage said to me, "Hey man, I didn’t know you were a pro soccer player, that’s awesome". It means I’m going in on an even keel with them.’

In 2008, Mr Jones was arrested and charged with assault after a violent bar brawl in the U.S. in which he was glassed in the face. He was later cleared of all charges.

Last year, his marriage came under strain when he was pictured kissing a 26-year-old Russian singer while filming his latest TV series in Moscow.

But despite his controversial reputation and penchant for playing thugs and gangsters, Mr Jones revealed he has a secret love for gentle nature documentaries.

He said: ‘If you want to know what makes me emotional, it’s nature stuff. I haven’t got Tarantino’s films on my iPad, I’ve got Attenborough.

'Growing up, [former England manager] Glenn Hoddle was my hero. But away from football, it was Attenborough. And it still is.’
