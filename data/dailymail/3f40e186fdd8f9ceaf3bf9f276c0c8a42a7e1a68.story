On trial: Matthew Dunford, pictured today, failed to attend court on February 2 because he had taken an overdoes the day before, the court heard

A fitness fanatic branded 'Britain's vainest man' took an overdose the day before he was convicted for setting up a fake website claiming his former girlfriend was a prostitute, a court heard. 

Matthew Dunford attempted to extort £5,000 from Brazilian model Amanda Branco, who once worked as a stripper.

When she refused to pay, the 30-year-old, who claims he spends £10,000-a-year on his looks, then created the escort website profile and sent it to her mother and sister.

He was then charged with stalking and was awaiting trial but he still went on to Facebook to repeat the false allegations that Ms Branco was a call girl and linked it to her employer's page.

Dunford was found guilty of two counts of harassment in his absence on February 2 after he failed to appear at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court. 

Today, the court heard that he did not attend because he was being treated in hospital after taking an overdose the previous day. 

He suffered a seizure and was unable to talk because he had vigorously chewed the inside of his mouth during the convulsion. 

He was only discharged in the early hours of 2 February, where he returned to his parents’ house in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire.

Leah Connolly, representing Dunford, said there were signs Dunford’s mental health is ‘deteriorating.’

‘This is a gentleman who is quite unwell,’ Ms Connolly said.

The court heard Dunford has been recovering with his father, who is a retired GP, and his mother, who is a nurse. 

Magistrate Greg Thomson refused an application to retry the case, given Dunford’s absence during the trial.

He said: ‘It is common ground by both the prosecution and defence that the overriding test is what is in the interests of justice.

‘One of the things we are clear about is that the interests of justice cover not just you but the victim in this case.’ Mr Thomson added that he was ‘sympathetic’ towards Dunford’s plight.

Dunford had promised to get Ms Branco ‘deported back to Brazil’ and claimed he had Jade Goody widow Jack Tweed’s lawyers working for him.

Dunford labelled Ms Branco ‘the most vile and fake’ person he had ever met, and maintained that he was going to do everything in his power to stop her ruining him, the court heard. 

Mr Thomson reassured Dunford that he would not be going to jail. Sentencing was later adjourned until 12 March while reports are prepared.
