He modestly described himself and his RAF comrades as ‘just playboys who wanted to fly planes’.

But Group Captain Billy Drake was one of Britain’s greatest air aces, destroying 25 enemy aircraft during the Second World War.

His first kills came during the Battle of Britain, the fight for air supremacy over southern England that ended Hitler’s invasion plans.

The extraordinary wartime service of one of Britain's greatest ever fighter aces, Billy Drake, has come to light, as his haul of wartime medals is set to go under the hammer

Now the legacy of his courage – his 
ten medals – are to be sold off to the highest bidder. They are expected
 to fetch up to £40,000.

They
 include his Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross 
and Bar. There is also an American Distinguished Flying Cross, awarded 
after he led fighter escorts for US bomber squadrons. Group Captain 
Drake, who died in August 2011 aged 93, flew Hurricanes, Spitfires, 
Kittyhawks and Typhoons, and fought in many theatres across Europe and 
North Africa.

During the 
Battle of Britain he was Squadron Leader of No1 Squadron which was 
credited with developing many of the combat techniques that were vital 
to victory.

Squadron leader Billy Drake downed at least 23 enemy planes in a career which saw the 'outstanding' WWIII pilot decorated with ten medals and a bar group which includes both the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the US Distinguish Flying Cross (DFC) for his skill in air combat

In spring 1940, 
his formation of Hurricanes attacked a squadron of Messerschmitt 109 
fighters and he scored his first victory. Shortly afterwards, he 
successfully downed three Dornier bombers. During another sortie, he was
 ordered by commanders to ‘p*ss off and go home’ after realising his 
plane was not equipped with an oxygen supply for high-altitudes.

But
 on turning, he spotted another three Dorniers and attacked them. One 
aircraft was shot down, but then he came under fire and had to bail out 
as his Hurricane caught fire.

By October 1942, he had transferred to North Africa, where he destroyed 17 more aircraft.

He
 was promoted to Wing Commander and took over a Spitfire wing in Malta 
in June 1943, providing protection to US bombers attacking Sicily. Later
 in the war he led Typhoons in attacks on V-1 rocket sites in France. He
 once said of his wartime career: ‘By God, we had a good time.’

Drake
 retired from the RAF in July 1963. He lived for 20 years in Portugal. 
Married twice and with two sons, he died in Teignmouth, Devon.

His medals will be auctioned by Bonhams in London on March 12.

The haul from his military service - which saw him serve in the battle of France, the battle of Britain, North Africa, Italy and Normandy - is expected to fetch up to £30,000 when it is sold

After his retirement in 1963 Mr Drake went on to become a lecturer and teacher at the RAF Fighter Leaders'School
