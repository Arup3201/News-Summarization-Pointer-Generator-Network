A cowboy builder who charged vulnerable pensioners up to 20 times more than they should have paid for work on their homes has been jailed. 

Ronald Connors charged on woman £140,000 for work that should only have cost just £6,000 at her home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. 

Cardiff Crown Court heard he lavished the money on new cars - including a £32,000 Range Rover.

His victims also included an 80-year-old woman from Whitchurch and a man aged 60 from Porthcawl with mental health issues.

A judge yesterday told the father-of-five, from Newport, that he was a 'thoroughly dishonest businessman' as he jailed him for 15 months.

He said it would have been longer had Connors, 39, who admitted three charges of aggressive business practice, not paid all of the money back.  

Prosecutor Lee Reynolds said: 'He was a rogue trader preying on the elderly and the vulnerable, charging them extortionate prices for substandard work and sometimes for work not done at all.

'One woman was charged 20 times the value and the other, 10 times.

'The third person didn't hand over any money but became upset and almost buckled under the aggressive behaviour from the defendant.'

The work in Rhiwbina took place over many months with the victim in the end having difficulty in recalling all the jobs her workmen claimed to have done.

Mr Reynolds told the court: 'It all started with weeds growing through the block paving in her drive and her being told there were problems underneath.

'She was given a quote for £6,000 which she agreed to pay but as the work was being done, some rendering fell off and they offered to re-render for £15,000.

'Then there was a wobbly window in her garage and the garage ended up being almost rebuilt and she was told there was damp. 

'They looked in her loft and gutters and weather boards were replaced.

'By that time she had paid about £70,000 to £90,000 - she says she lost track and told the police 'they just kept finding things to do'.'

Mr Reynolds said: 'She paid out £52,000 in February 2012 and that month Ronald Connors bought a £32,000 Range Rover and in March a Ford Fiesta costing £10,000.'

In 2011, his other elderly victim paid Connors cheques totalling £22,000 for work valued at £2,000.

Mr Reynolds said: 'The inside of her flat did need redecorating but when it was viewed later, the work which included damp-proofing, fitting lighting and two heaters was valued at £1,900 to £2,000.She had paid 10 times the true value.'

In Porthcawl, a neighbour was looking out for the 60-year-old who had already been targeted by cold callers.

Mr Reynolds said that when he was given a quote from Connors to tidy up his garden, alarm bells rang. 

'He was advised to cancel the agreed quote for £7,000, his neighbour helped him write a letter which was posted by recorded delivery but a few days later the defendant turned up saying he was going to do the work. 

'He was aggressive, threatening and abusive.'

Henry Hughes, defending, said Connors had no previous convictions and had built up his business since the age of 18. But at the time he was under financial pressure and sub-contracted jobs to others, not realising the work they were doing was deficient.

'He thought it was being done properly' Mr Hughes told the judge.

'He had no idea it was of poor standard. He now accepts he was too aggressive in his practises.'

The court heard claims that Connors had taken out a bridging loan to repay the victims and that had cost him £30,000.

Recorder George Bull QC told Connors: 'You are a thoroughly dishonest businessman preying on people and you chose your victims carefully and it was going on over a period of time. It was despicable conduct and you should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself.'

Connors was ordered to pay the £18,832 cost of his prosecution by Cardiff council. A Criminal Behaviour Order also bans him from canvassing the elderly door-to-door in future.

Speaking after the hearing, Cardiff cabinet member Councillor De'Ath said: 'Our key priority was to recover the money that had been conned from Ronald Connors' victims and I am pleased this has been successful. 

'The sentence should also send a strong message to all rogue traders that we will investigate all complaints made, with a view to recover the proceeds of their crimes and prosecute them through the courts.'
