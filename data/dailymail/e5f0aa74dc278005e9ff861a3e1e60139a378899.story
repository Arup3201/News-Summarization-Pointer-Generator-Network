Jeremy Paxman, pictured on Newsnight, said he has been 'astonished' by the reaction to his beard

If Jeremy Paxman takes a razor to his beard in the next few days, don’t blame pognophobes at the BBC – vanity will probably get to him first.

The Newsnight presenter revealed he thinks he now looks like Albert Steptoe and said he should probably shave it off if he wants to look his age.   

Writing in a Sunday newspaper, he said a friend had told him the beard made him look older, adding: ‘If you’re 63, this is not necessarily a good idea.

‘Wilfrid Brambell played Albert Steptoe when he was only 50, and it was the beard (now I come to think of it, not very dissimilar to my own)... Would we have believed he really ate pickled onions in the bath had he been clean-shaven? Of course not.’

After Paxman unveiled the facial fuzz last week, he accused BBC colleagues of pognophobia, an irrational fear of beards, after they questioned whether he should front the show unshaven.

Paxman says becoming the poster-boy for beards has been a 'heavy burden'.

The Newsnight presenter became the centre of a Twitterstorm last week but reactions to his facial hair were divided - with some viewers saying he looked like a 'rubbish Doctor Who'.  

The 63-year-old said he has been shocked by the reaction to his stubble.

He said he was surprised about the widespread reporting about of his facial hair that he called 'a storm in a shaving mug.'

Paxman said the reaction 'may explain why beardies seem to consider themselves an oppressed minority.'

The presenter said men with beards have shouted words of encouragement in the street, asking him not to shave it off.

He wrote: 'I had joined a section of society that I fully expect - indeed I demand - merits the sort of legal protection accorded to other minorities.'

Paxman unveiled his new hairy face for the first time on Monday. 

Within minutes of his appearance, it became one of the most talked-about subjects on Twitter.

Paxman’s colleague Emily Maitlis responded by joking: ‘Right that’s it. I’m working on a moustache for Thursday’s Newsnight.’

Last week, the presenter accused the BBC of pogonophobia - an irrational fear of beards - and said the only beards acceptable to the corporation are worn by Uncle Albert on Only Fools and Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza. 

Paxman said the more powerful men become, the more clean shaven they are likely to be.

However, he said vanity and the aging effect of his beard means he is considering shaving off his facial hair.

He wrote that his friends have told him his new look makes him look older.

He wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: 'For a glorious few days, I have been a poster-boy for a shadowy group called the Beard Liberation Front, which claims that facial hair invites discrimination.

'I'm finding it quite a heavy burden.'
