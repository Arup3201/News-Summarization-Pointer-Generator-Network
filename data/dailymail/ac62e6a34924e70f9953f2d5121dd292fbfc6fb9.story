This cheeky monkey clearly loves the limelight as it sticks out a tongue for the cameras in its first public appearance at a New york City zoo.

The baby western lowland gorilla is one of two new arrivals at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo - the first since 2006.

Zoo officials said Thursday the babies' genders aren't yet known as neither have left their mothers' breasts since birth, leaving keepers unable to check.

And it may still take some time to find out as gorilla infants are held by their protective mothers for the first four months of their lives.

A gorilla named Julia gave birth on March 10. Another named Tuti had her baby on April 17.

Newborns weigh about 4 to 5 pounds. Females could grow up to weigh 250 pounds, males about 450 pounds.

Zoo visitors can see the babies this spring if conditions such as the weather and temperature are right.
