A crumbling city flattened by an earthquake filled with families still struggling to rebuild their lives needed nothing short of a superhero, and lucky for a New Zealand city that's exactly what they got.

Flatman emerged from the rubble following one of the most devastating natural disasters Christchurch had ever seen, anonymously delivering supplies to those who needed it most.

Now, nearly three years into his mission the secretive superhero is going from strength to strength armed with his simple message 'Be a bruv... Share the luv', and a whole lot of kindness.

Flatman, the hero Christchurch needs has been delivering food packs, working with kids and spreading random acts of kindness across the New Zealand city since 2011

The anonymous red and black caped crusader has been buying and delivering food parcels to struggling families, quake-hit residents and impoverished students of the flattened city.

'People had this real negative vibe around Christchurch and I wanted to change that . A lot of my friends were leaving the city and more people followed,' Flatman told the Daily Mail Australia.

'I love Christchurch and have always lived here so I wanted to bring back some joy and happiness to the city in a quirky fun way. Initially I thought to just help my friends with some food package deliveries but then changed it to strangers, and within one day I had made a Facebook page, ordered a costume and delivered my first two food packages to people.'

A new short documentary in sync with the superhero's strong social media presence gives an insight into the life of Flatman and brings to light the good deeds he does for those in need.

Originally Flatman's aim was to help struggling students, knowing all too well the toils of studying while trying to support yourself, made all the more difficult by the earthquake.

'The first people I was delivering to were all students...Seeing as a lot were leaving Christchurch for Australia or further afield it seemed like a way I could help.

'So that's why the name 'Flatman' came about as students pretty much all live in flats together. It wasn't until it started getting in the local papers that the focus changed from students to families and children, and pretty much anyone that could do with some cheering up,' he said.

The Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 flattened the city on New Zealand's south island, killing 185 and devastating many more who escaped with their lives but barely anything else.

Since the devastating natural disaster, Flatman's focus has now changed, and he is now quite literally the city's hero, travelling far and wide to work with school kids, inspiring them to be their very own superheroes by 'being kind, generous, and looking out for each other.'

In his red and black lycra costume complete with a mask and gloves, Flatman spreads hope with random acts of kindness, including what he calls 'Flatman vs traffic jam packs', small gifts given to drivers stuck in traffic to brighten their days.

But his trademark power is the secret delivery of food packs, which he drops on people's doorsteps when they least expect it, often when they haven't even asked for help.

These packs generally include some basic food items plus some other goodies, and always have toilet paper in them.

'The food packages are a mixture of essentials like toilet paper, tomato sauce , rice and pasta to more of the treat items like Oreos, Tim Tams, lollies and chips. Most food packages are around the $30 mark,' Flatman said.

Originally Flatman paid for these all out of his own pocket, and admitted he could spend up to $600 per month putting together the parcels.

Community engagement is just part of Flatman's duties as the Christchurch superhero

Flatman started his self-driven mission following the devastation of the Christchurch earthquake in 2011, which destroyed the city and left thousands without their homes

Now thanks to sponsorship and community donations, the caped crusader has a little more help providing to those in need, and can assist with more specific requests.

'I started off paying for the groceries myself which some months would get super expensive but it never worried me as my main focus was helping others,' Flatman revealed.

'I now have sponsors like Stadium Cars who gave me the flat mobile to make my deliveries in, and also Countdown (supermarket) and Hubbards cereal who provide me with vouchers and food to distribute to deserving people.'

As well as inspiring school kids all around the city, Flatman visits children's hospitals - often calling in the help of his super friends to brighten up the lives of sick kids.

Earlier this month he staged a 'Superhero Takeover', a visit to the Children's Ward at Christchurch Hospital to spread to the 'luv' to young ones and their families struggling with illness.

With a crew bragging Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Iron Man and Captain America and more in tow, the band of merry men and women took over the ward in true superhero style scaling buildings, surprising children and spreading love.

With his horizons ever expanding, Flatman revealed he responds to all sorts of requests that come to him from the local community.

Another of the hero's trademarks is 'Flatman vs traffic packs' which can include stress balls or lollies for drivers stuck in their cars

'I get a mixture of requests and nominations through my Facebook page and email. I never judge anyone that writes in as anybody is deserving of an act of random kindness. And that's what it is,' he said.

'I know that one food package isn't going to change the world but it might just make their day, week or month that little bit easier knowing someone has taken a moment of their day to care about them.'

Flatman originally had a side-kick, Quake Boy, but is now on the hunt for a new friend to join him, and duties would include 'delivering of food packages, spreading joy and teaching children the powers of kindness'.

The prospective assistant must also be able to drive the Flat mobile, a bright red decorated car splashed with Flatman's name, and will also need to don their very own lycra costume.

When asked what was next on the agenda, the secret superhero said he would love to be Flatman full-time but it's too difficult to juggle around work. This however, is not a deterrent and he is committed to continuing his incredible work.

'Ive always got plans for the future. Being a superhero you never stop thinking up ways of trying to help others ,' Flatman said.

'Some of my more ambitious ideas are to create a Superhero Base right here in Christchurch that I can not only work from but kids can come and visit, interact with and leave with the message that anyone can be a superhero if they're kind, generous and show compassion to others.

Flatman is now on the look out for a side-kick, someone who can help spread the message of kindness to kids all while wearing lycra

The superhero wants to travel to other parts of the world and assist in areas that suffered similar devastation to his hometown Christchurch

'I'd also love to take the message to other countries who perhaps have gone through equally tough natural disasters like Christchurch and visit kids and families to help lighten the situation using kindness and fun as the main drives.

'I need to be Flatman full-time with the all the school requests , charity and events requests and food deliveries. Maybe one day the right company or person will step up to make this childhood dream come true.'
