Thanks to a successful social media campaign, an Alabama man was reunited with a nurse who took care of him more than 40 years ago while he was recovering from open heart surgery. 

Gary Bentley was 10 in 1973 when he underwent surgery at University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital to repair a hole in his left ventricle. 

Bentley recalled the nurse who cared for him could tell he 'needed a friend', but he had trouble remembering much else when he and his wife discovered her photo while they were going through old things in Killen, Alabama.

A social media campaign to find Nurse Kathy began after this photo was posted on Facebook by Bentley 

After the meeting, Bentley wrote: 'She is still the same sweet Nurse Kathy I remember from years ago'

The photo showed Bentley as a boy posing next to a young nurse with brown hair. 

In the picture, he has a sullen expression on his face and a large scar running down his chest.

When his wife Gwen asked him about the identity of the nurse, Bentley only could come up with the name Kathy, Al.com reported.

They decided to try to locate her and posted the picture on both of their Facebook pages. 

Bentley said: 'For some reason, she was really sweet to me, and I looked forward to her coming in every day.

'I guess she just saw that I needed a friend. 

'She took special interest in me for some reason.' 

When they met, Bentley brought Nurse Kathy flowers and the framed photo of them both standing together

On Thursday, they got an email from Kathy's daughter Heather.

She wrote: 'I know the nurse in the picture and she is my mom.

'You are right, her name is Kathy! 

'I just read her this article and she is so touched that she was remembered so fondly by you!"

It turns out Kathy is still a nurse and she works at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika.

Another one of Kathy's three children, Katie, wrote her mother had 'tears to her eyes' while reading an article about Bentley's search. 

Bentley and Nurse Kathy began communicating and arranged to meet on Sunday afternoon at Vulcan Park.

After the meeting, Bentley wrote on Facebook: 'I was right!

'She is still the same sweet Nurse Kathy I remember from years ago.  

'Nurse Kathy and I both are so humbled by all of the kind words and the help from everyone so we could find each other. 

'I cannot describe my feelings. ‪#‎nursekathy‬' 

In addition to Nurse Kathy, Bentley was also aided by three foster families while he was growing up

Before he arrived on Sunday, Bentley posted about what he was going through on Facebook. 

He wrote: 'I'm just sitting in the back seat riding along on a trip to meet my Nurse Kathy! 

'My son is driving and my mind is racing. 

'I can't believe 42 years have gone by so fast, like a blink. My mind is running all over the place. 

'I so hope this is a day that brings smiles to her face for many years to come.'

Bentley runs a turtle farm and calls himself the Alabama Turtle Farmer. 

In addition to Nurse Kathy, he was also aided by three foster families while growing up. 

He works as a motivational speaker when he isn't raising his turtles.
