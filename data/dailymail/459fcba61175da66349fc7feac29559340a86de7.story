Clutching a walking stick for support, Andrew Marr returned to front his BBC politics show today- nine months after a massive stroke almost ended his life.

His return today was welcomed with the support of viewers and guests including Chancellor George Osborne, shadow defence secretary Douglas Alexander and Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu.

Marr was left with seriously impaired mobility down his left side after suffering a serious stroke overnight in January.

Andrew Marr returned to his BBC television programme today to the delight of guests and viewers

The broadcaster received a touching gesture of support from one of his guests,
 Dr Sentamu who grasped his impaired left arm, and he
 would pray for his recovery.

The tender moment came at the end of
 their interview when Marr, 53, referred to the Archbishop’s own recent 
battle with prostate cancer and said: ‘You’ve also been ill so it’s very
 wonderful to see you back as well, may I say?’

The 
Archbishop replied: ‘I just want to say what happened to me when I had 
this terrible illness, friends prayed for me, prayers encouraged me and I
 just hope the same thing will happen to you.'

Dr Sentamu then 
held Marr’s left arm and in a reference to the biblical story of a man 
with a ‘withered’ hand who was healed by Jesus on the Sabbath.

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne appeared on The Andrew Marr Show today to review the parliamentary vote on Syria

He said: 
‘Like in Luke Chapter 6, we had the man with a hand like yours. Jesus 
you know raises it up. And I’m going to... and I’m going to work hard, 
I’m going to work there that your hand begins to work. And nice to see 
you back.'

Mr Marr replied: ‘Needs some work on it, needs some work on it. Thank you so much, Archbishop.’ 

The day before suffering the near fatal stroke, Mr Marr said he had been struck by a ‘blinding headache and flashes of light’ as he finished a vigorous workout on a rowing machine at home in East Sheen, south-west London.

Doctors later discovered he had torn the carotid artery. Mercifully, the area of the brain that controls speech and memory was unaffected.

The presenter spent two months in hospital and has undergone intense physiotherapy to regain movement in his left arm and leg, the latter of which has recovered more quickly.

Marr, a father-of-three, had planned to return full-time to his show this month so as to coincide with the ‘natural beginning of the political year’.

Today's comeback followed a brief appearance on the show in early July, when he pre-recorded a ten-minute interview with David Milliband, the former Labour Foreign Secretary.

Guest presenters such as Jeremy Vine, Sophie Raworth and Eddie Mair had been standing in for the former BBC political editor and newspaper editor.

Wearing a blue suit, white shirt and gold tie, Marr stood with the walking stick in his right hand to introduce the show today.

He told viewers: ‘Well, here we are again. I have to start this morning with a few ‘thank yous’, to all my excellent colleagues who have been keeping the show on the road.

Daily Mail columnist Amanda Platell and historian Simon Schama reviewed the sunday newspapers with Andrew Marr on today's programme

‘Thanks also to all the many viewers who’ve sent so many kind and wise messages.

And thanks, last but not least, to all of you who were frankly pleased to see the back of me but never quite got round to writing to say so. Thank you for that as well.’

In a newspaper interview published ahead of his return on Friday, the veteran journalist said he was ‘slightly nervous’ about returning to the politics, current affairs and culture show, but added: ‘I’m physically fine - my left arm is still quite weak, I walk with a bit of a hobble - but mentally I am fine and that’s hopefully all that matters.’

Other guests on the hour-long programme included Chancellor George Osborne and shadow defence secretary Douglas Alexander.

In an interview with the Daily Mail in June, Mr Marr said he had been told by doctors that he almost died twice, and that his wife, Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley, had been told to expect the worst. He said he had been working too hard in the run-up to the stroke.

Viewers hailed the broadcaster’s comeback on social networking site Twitter today.

Dan McGrady from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, said: ‘Good to see a very healthy-looking Andrew #Marr where he belongs. #MarrShow.'

A BBC spokesman today said the broadcaster would continue to present the show each week, and would also return to Radio 4’s Start the Week ‘in due course’.
