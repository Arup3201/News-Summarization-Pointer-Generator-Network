Pregnant women in the workplace have been told to consider an abortion, belittled and called 'placenta brain' by colleagues, a new report has revealed.

The Australian Human Rights Commission's Pregnancy and Return to Work National Review Report, was released on Friday, found that one in two women and one in four men have experienced discrimination during pregnancy, parental leave or upon returning to work.

The first national inquiry into pregnancy discrimination in the workforce was conducted 15 years ago however not much progress has been made since then, Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick wrote in the recent report.

A new report has found that Australian women still face workplace discrimination as one mother detailed that a supervisor said her pregnancy was 'inconvenient' and asked if she considered getting an abortion

'This National Review confirms that the situation has not markedly changed,' Ms Broderick wrote.

'Working while pregnant is still often seen as a privilege, not a right. Not only that, this view extends to parents on return to work. Discrimination continues to be widespread and has a cost - not just to women, working parents and their families - but also to workplaces and the national economy.'

The commission report, which surveyed 2000 mothers and 1000 fathers, further found that the nature of discrimination involved pregnant women being perceived as an inconvenience and liability in the workplace.

'When I told my supervisor I was pregnant, the response was "well, you will need to leave - this is very inconvenient for the organisation - you should have told us that you were planning this - have you considered [an] abortion?",' one woman said.

Other inappropriate comments involved a woman who was belittled by a colleague.

'One of the other men in the office had started calling me "placenta brain" when I was pregnant,' she said.

Another woman was told she 'was no longer an asset to the business, just a liability'.

Women also reported receiving no support from managers about their family obligations.

'It was relayed to me that now that I have a child that I should focus on that more and not be so hungry to be progressive in my career. That by offering me this lower job they were allowing me to be a better mother,' one woman said.

Other incidents involved a female manager telling a mother that she had to choose between a family or a senior role in the company as 'it's a myth you can have both'.

Almost one in five mothers indicated that they were made redundant, restructured, dismissed or their contract was not renewed either during their pregnancy, when they requested or took parental leave or when they returned to work.

One pregnant woman who suffered from morning sickness says she was told that she was spending too much time in the bathroom and not enough on the shop floor.

'Even though he [the boss] knew I had morning sickness, he'd text me while I was vomiting and tell me to get back onto the floor immediately,' the woman said.

'I had bad back and leg pain, but I wasn't allowed to sit down. If I did, he'd click his fingers at me like I was a dog and tell me to stand up.'

Nothing was done when the woman made a complaint to Human Resources.

Ms Broderick says the review does seek to devalue the role undertaken by parents and carers nor does it aim to push women into paid work.

'What it seeks to do is to ensure that discrimination is no longer the reason that women opt out of the paid workforce,' she said.

'Just as we all have a right to family, we also have a right to paid work. If we work together, we can create workplaces where pregnancy, parental leave and return to work discrimination have no place.

'We can ensure that three years from now, when we release the next prevalence survey, the outlook it captures will be considerably brighter.'
