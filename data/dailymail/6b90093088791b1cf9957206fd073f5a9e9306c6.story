Dead: Shele Danishefsky Covlin's husband claims she wanted to be buried in Israel where her body would never have been exhumed

The husband of a wealthy UBS executive tried to have his estranged wife buried in Israel -  which would have prevented her body from being exhumed and the resulting autopsy that revealed she had been murdered.

The rabbi and the brother-in-law of Shele Danishefsky both said no one in the family knew of her supposed wishes to be buried in Israel.

They added that had it been carried out , no one would have they learned she had been strangled in her Upper West Side apartment.

Shele Danishefsky was found dead on 
New Year's Eve 2009 by her estranged husband and their then 
nine-year-old daughter Anna in the bathroom of their apartment. It was 
at first ruled as an accidental falling.

It
later emerged that the mother-of-two was suing Covlin for civil  
divorce, had a restraining order against him and was scheduled to meet 
the next day with her lawyer to remove him from her will.

Brother-in-law Marc Karstaedt has also accused Rob Covlin of upsetting his wife's family even further by placing a stone marker on her grave which read 'beloved mother and wife', despite the fact she obtained a religious divorce from him before her 2009 death.

Nothing on the grave stone at Westchester County cemetery mentioned her parents or siblings, despite the fact they pleaded with him to include them.

Mr Karstaedt told the New York Post that his wife Eve, Shele's sister 'wept hysterically' when she first saw the grave stone.

He said: 'We stood there together, shattered, 
incredulous that anyone would contemplate such a despicable act — let 
alone act on it,' after they visited the Jewish cemetery site 
with his wife on the second Hebrew calendar anniversary of Shele’s
murder.

Rabbi Shaul Robinson, who was also a close friend of the 47-year-old, told the Post of the marker: 'I knew that was absolutely 
not what Shele would have wanted on her grave. I cannot tell you how 
strongly she didn’t want to have anything to do with Covlin.

'It was very wrong to maintain or imply that there was a loving marital relationship when she died, because there was not.'

Accused: Rod Covlin, centre, pictured with his mother and attorney after he appeared in court last April over custody of their children. he has been temporarily blocked from accessing his wife's estate

Last April, Covlin filed papers in Westchester County 
Surrogate’s Court asking to be named guardian of the cashed-in 
Aetna policy that his wife had left for their children Anna, now 11, and 
Myles, five.

But he was recently blocked from 
gaining further access to the $1.6million life-insurance-policy payout 
she left for their children.

A source told The New York Post Covlin 
had been listed as the beneficiary of the insurance policy but Shele 
changed it to her children four weeks before she died.

Covlin, a former stock trader and backgammon player, remains the focus of the murder probe by the Manhattan's DA office.

His lawyer Robert Gottlieb maintains 
his 38-year-old client's innocence and criticised the family for not 
respecting Shele's wishes involving her burial.

He said: 'There’s no question that 
Shele told Rod, her husband, that she wanted to be buried in Israel. In 
2008, they visited Israel, they visited her family’s area, where members
of her family are buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

He also said that Covlin discussed 
with his 'very mature' daughter about what to put on the grave stone and
where to have her buried and they came to the decision together.

'As I understand it, they weren’t 
divorced at the time, and Anna, who again is a very mature 11-year-old, 
wanted that,' Mr Gottlieb told the Post. 'To attack what’s written on 
the stone is just grossly inappropriate, and very sad.'

Scene: Her body was found in the bath tub of her apartment in the Upper West Side of Manhattan by her daughter and husband. Her purse and cell phone were missing

Rabbi Robinson said no one in his 
family could believe that Shele would want to have been buried in Israel
as she had twins girls who died at birth and were buried in a New York 
cemetery plot. They believed she would have wanted to be buried beside 
them.

Mr Karstaedt added: 'We
found it unbelievable that Shele would have shared that wish with 
[Covlin] and not with other family members with whom she was so 
close.'

Because of Orthodox Jewish practice 
which does not allow autopsies, Shele was buried without one being 
performed. But when the family grew suspicious that the 47-year-old had 
fallen victim to foul play, her body was exhumed and an autopsy 
performed, which found her death was by strangulation and not accidental
falling.

In December, a wrongful death lawsuit was filed by the Manhattan public administrator against the former stock trader.

The
suit charged that Covlin 'intentionally, deliberately, willfully, 
wantonly, maliciously, brutally and without provocation or just cause 
did strangle, choke, strike, injure, assault, abuse, beat and murder' 
his wife.

Fall: Shele Covlin was found in the bath tub of her apartment (file photo) by her daughter with a gash to her head so her death was ruled as accidental

A week later it emerged he had been blocked from gaining further access to the account and stripped of his powers to control it.

Although both of the couple's children
stand to inherit the money when they are 18, the 39-year-old does have 
the power to invest and can apply for the court to withdraw cash.

Covlin lives in Westchester County with his children. Shele’s brother Philip Danishefsky is seeking custody of the kids.

If he is indicted and found guilty of
killing his wife, he will lose his share of her estate, all of which 
would go to the children.

He has never been arrested or charged in her death.

At the time of her death, the 
unemployed Covlin was living across the hall from his former wife and 
their daughter and son, all of whom had an order of protection against 
him.

After the daughter found Shele in the bathroom, she went to get her dad and let him in the apartment.

Sources
told The Post that in the aftermath of Shele’s death, her purse and 
smart-phone went missing. Both contained her schedule for meetings with a
lawyer to discuss removing Rod from her will.
