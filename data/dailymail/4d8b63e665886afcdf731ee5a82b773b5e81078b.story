The Mayor of Calais has demanded that hundreds of migrants in a squalid camp are moved to a comfortable new tented area.

Natacha Bouchart has previously warned that migrants in the town are ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain and its generous benefits.

But there are fears the new campsite – close to the port where many try and board lorries heading for Kent – will cause more problems for drivers and British border staff. Madame Bouchart called for a camp known as Jungle 2 to be closed so inhabitants can be moved to more comfortable and hygienic conditions. At least 900 migrants live at the rubbish-infested site, trying to reach the UK.

It is feared the new site, which will be close to the Jules Ferry camp, which opened last month, will encourage even more people into the area 

Last night a senior British politician said the move was an example of French authorities’ ‘failure’ to deal with the problem – and accused them of offering only a ‘sticking plaster’ solution.

The tented site will have washing facilities and be close to the Jules Ferry camp, dubbed ‘Sangatte 2’, which opened last month. That 12-acre centre has beds, showers, toilets, a laundry service and medical facilities for about 2,500 migrants.

The new ‘Bouchart’ camp will see ‘guests’ eat meals prepared by a Michelin chef at Jules Ferry.

Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson MP, who last year spoke of seeing ‘tents on roundabouts’ and ‘bedspreads in bus shelters’ in Calais, said migrants should be stopped from entering France.

He added: ‘It is important the French authorities take action to identify who it is who comes to Calais and then determine whether or not they have a legitimate claim for asylum or refugee status or whether they are illegal immigrants … This problem won’t go away till France takes this responsibility seriously and whatever they are doing in providing accommodation is a sticking plaster for a clear French failure.’

The mayor’s plan will see UK-bound migrants moved to the new camp on council-owned land. From next month women and children will be given priority for overnight accommodation at Jules Ferry while men will sleep in tents at the adjacent site.

Lorry drivers crossing into Britain already have to check their vehicles for stow-aways,  a desperate migrants try to enter the country illegally

The decision to shut Jungle 2 comes after violent disturbances in August when large numbers began arriving from Eritrea and Ethiopia.

Six months ago a judge approved the removal of hundreds of migrants from the camp, which is on privately owned land. But police failed to close it or move its inhabitants.

Huge piles of rat-infested rubbish have since accumulated and migrants hacked down trees for fuel. They also broke into a gymnasium where dozens of families now live.

Announcing the plans earlier this week, Madam Bouchart said: ‘The aim is to evacuate the company’s land and to protect the migrants.’

But the move is likely to cause more problems for lorry drivers who have to check their vehicles for migrants trying to get to Britain. The mayor’s solution will also anger UK border staff trying to stem the tide of migrants arriving via Calais.

Calais residents fear a new camp will encourage a further 1,400 people sleeping rough to head for the site and make a huge ‘tent city’ within weeks.

It is unclear how much the new camp will cost but Jules Ferry is expected to cost £6million a year to run – with half of that bill paid from an EU grant partly funded by British taxpayers.
