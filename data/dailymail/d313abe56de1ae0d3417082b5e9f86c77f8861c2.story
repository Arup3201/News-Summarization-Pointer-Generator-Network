Jeremy Hunt will warn hospital bosses about the dangers of simply aiming for 'not coming last'

Too many middle-of-the-road hospitals are 'hitting targets but missing the point', the Health Secretary is to warn.

Jeremy Hunt will say that hospitals which simply meet minimum standards should tackle 'mediocrity and low expectations before they turn into failure and tragedy'.

During a speech at the Nuffield Trust’s health policy conference in Dorking, Surrey, Mr Hunt will warn hospital bosses about the dangers of simply aiming for 'not coming last'.

Average hospitals which meet national targets but are not doing anything to improve their services are 'not good enough', he will add.

He is expected to say: 'Imagine for a moment that the main objective for our Olympic athletes was not to win but to ‘not come last’. How many gold medals would we have won then?

'It sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? But today I want to suggest that too much of the NHS is focused on doing just that.

'Not on achieving world-class levels of excellence - the gold medals of healthcare - but meeting minimum standards, the equivalent of ‘not coming last.

'Coasting can kill. Not straight away, but over time as complacency sets in, organisations look inwards, standards drop and then, suddenly, something gives.

'The lesson of Mid Staffs is surely that we need to understand why they fail in the first place - which means tackling mediocrity and low expectations before they turn into failure and tragedy.'

He is expected to add: 'There are plenty of other hospitals where their staff friends and family scores are about the same today as they were in 2009. They’re hitting their targets, they’re not failing but, on the basis of this indicator anyway, they’re standing still.

'Hospitals must not be allowed to cruise along, hitting the targets but missing the point.

“Because ‘not bad’ is not good enough. Not if we want the NHS to be the best in the world. Not if we want everyone to have access to the best healthcare. Not if we are to meet the challenges of increasing expectation alongside increasing age.'

Harsh lessons: Mr Hunt will add that the NHS must learn from the failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust

He said that one hospital significantly improved standards by listening to patient feedback and introducing a 'new culture of patient-centred ambition'.

'In the 2010 national patient survey, Walsall Manor Hospital scored in the bottom 20 per cent on more than half the questions asked,' he will say.

'They were not in a good place and they knew it. So they introduced the friends and family test. They now ask every patient, very simply, how likely they are to recommend Walsall Manor to their friends or family and to name one thing they could do to improve their stay.

'From TV remote controls, to warmer rooms to staff shortages, patient feedback led to fast corrective action, including focusing more resources in wards that were under pressure.

'A year ago, their own patient satisfaction scores averaged 65 per cent. Today, they’re up to 75 per cent.

'In that same period, C. Diff infections are down 80 per cent, pressure ulcers are down 30 per cent and falls down 20 per cent. Not all of this is because of patient feedback, but it is thanks to a new culture of patient-centred ambition - as Richard Kirby, the chief executive says: "It’s changed the nature of the discussion".'
