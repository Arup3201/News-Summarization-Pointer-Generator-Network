A couple who refused to reveal how their three-month-old son sustained 'horrific' injuries have been condemned by a judge for their possible 'conspiracy of silence' which allowed them to avoid jail.

Tracy McKenzie of Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, and her former partner Scott Colman of Bishop Auckland were both handed eight-month suspended sentences despite admitting child cruelty against their son Harper.

Burnley Crown Court heard how the baby was left with multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs and also suffered multiple brain and retinal haemorrhages. Little Harper was also only admitted to hospital five days after the injuries emerged.

But neither parents would reveal  what happened to the  boy, despite the court being told the injuries were consistent with 'shaking, twisting, bending and hitting'.

Instead, both defendants pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis that neither of them had sought medical assistance for Harper's head injury.

The court was told how 30-year-old Colman even tried to suggest that the injuries were inflicted by Harper's twin while they were playfully 'flicking each other with their hands'. 

Handing them an eight-month jail term suspended for two years, Judge Woolson said he had been 'unimpressed' by the couple's silence.

But he said he was only able to sentence the pair on the basis they had failed to obtain medical help.

He said: 'I am unimpressed by the silence over whichever of you knows what has happened. It may even be a conspiracy of silence between the two of you, both of who knows what has happened.

'The injuries were appalling and inflicted over five days. I have to sentence on the basis that you should have taken the child to hospital.'   

The court heard that McKenzie, 41, had claimed she had come home from work on December 11, 2012 and seen a bruise on the child's forehead.

The court heard the baby had also been 'generally lethargic' and vomiting. He had also not wet his nappy in the days before he was admitted to hospital.

Five days later, on December 16, Colman - said to be the carer of the children - called NHS Direct and explained his son's symptoms.

Harper was then taken to hospital by ambulance, where doctors noticed the bruising to his head, the court was told. 

Prosecutor Robert Smith said: 'The doctor advised he needed to be placed on a drip.

'A senior doctor immediately noticed something was wrong, significant bruising to the left side of the temple and asked how it was obtained, he described a "vague" explanation, something about the twins banging heads.'

A further CT scan showed fractures to each side of Harper's skull and acute haemorrhages. 

Medics also detected a collection of bruises. 

A full skeletal survey further showed multiple skull fractures, fractures to the spine and five rib fractures. 

There were also back and ankle injuries, as well as haemorrhages behind the eye, the court heard.

During the case, it emerged that Harper's skull injuries were in keeping with being hit against a flat surface or something striking his head.

Meanwhile, the hemorrhages were in keeping with the baby being shaken, while the fractured ribs could have been caused from forceable compression to his chest, the court was told.

The spinal injuries were consistent with the child being bent or allowed to fall heavily, experts said.

Mr Smith said that doctors had unanimously agreed that the injuries were not accidental and would have caused the baby 'such pain and discomfort' that the parents, 'should have known and intervened if they had known the perpetrator'.  

Mr Smith added: 'Both were arrested and interviewed and gave entirely implausible evidence. Scott Colman said he had slipped on the ice whilst holding Harper.'

The court heard that Colman suggested Harper and his twin could have 'headbutted' one another while playing.

He further suggested that he had rolled out of the Moses basket, but medical experts dismissed the claims. 

During the hearing, Philip Parry said that McKenzie had assisted the prosecution in becoming a witness after pleading during her trial. 

In her basis of plea, the prosecutor Robert Smith told the court that McKenzie had said she had not been aware of the underlying injuries but accepted that she should have sought medical assistance after the bruising had occurred. 

Colman, 30, had previously denied child neglect but admitted the charge before standing trial. 

Burnley Crown Court heard how Harper was not taken to hospital until five days after his injuries were noticed. Both parents admitted child neglect for failing to seek medical attention 

For Colman, Philip Holden said: 'Regrettably we will never know who caused these injuries, not to the criminal standards. There is no doubt that this is an extremely sad case.'

He argued that the duo, who are now separated, should be given the same distinction in sentencing, adding that the child had made 'a good recovery'.

In passing sentence Judge Woolman said that their basis of plea had been the failure to take the child to hospital. 

He said: 'In the five days or so leading up to admission at A&E it must have been obvious that the child was severely unwell.

'It is obvious to any decent person that something urgent needed to be done. Having said that I have to be true to the basis of plea in that you entered, namely that you failed to take the child to hospital.

'I am and I should make it clear that I am unimpressed by the silence by which one of knows what happens, it may even be a conspiracy of silence between the two of you and both of you know what happened.

'I can only sentence you on what you have entered and what can be proved.

'The injuries were appalling, inflicted over a period of say five days but I have to sentence you on the basis that you should have taken the child to hospital.

'The sentence of imprisonment which this case justifies is in months and not years. I am prepared to suspend, the only reason is to be honest with the basis of plea.'
