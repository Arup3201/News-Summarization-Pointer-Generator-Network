Paris St Germain have been called before UEFA's disciplinary commission over allegations of racism by their fans at last month's Champions League clash against Chelsea in Paris.

The allegations concern 'racism, other discriminatory conduct and propaganda' during April 2's home leg of the quarter-final, according to the governing body. PSG won the match 3-1 but went on to lose the tie on away goals.

A UEFA statement released to Press Association Sport read: 'Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against PSG on 16 May 2014 for alleged offences concerning "racism, other discriminatory conduct and propaganda" at their UEFA Champions League quarter-final played against Chelsea in Paris.

'The UEFA control and disciplinary body will decide on the matter on 17 July 2014.

'We do not make any further comment until the official disciplinary decision is announced by end of July.'

The match was preceded by clashes between rival supporters on the streets of Paris, with Chelsea fans reportedly chanting racist abuse and making Nazi salutes while a group of around 100 PSG ultras targeted travelling fans.

A report on the website of Paris newspaper Le Parisien on Tuesday evening indicated that a group of disabled Chelsea fans had filed a complaint after objects including chewing gum and a bottle were thrown at them during the game at the Parc des Princes.

UEFA's disciplinary regulations specify a minimum sanction of a partial stadium closure for a club found guilty of a first offence of racist abuse by their supporters.

Article 14 of the regulations also states: 'A second offence is punished with one match played behind closed doors and a fine of 50,000 euros.

'Any subsequent offence is punished with more than one match behind closed doors, a stadium closure, the forfeiting of a match, the deduction of points or disqualification from the competition.

'If the circumstances of the case require it, the competent disciplinary body may impose additional disciplinary measures on the member association or club responsible, such as the playing of one or more matches behind closed doors, a stadium closure, the forfeiting of a match, the deduction of points or disqualification from the competition.'
