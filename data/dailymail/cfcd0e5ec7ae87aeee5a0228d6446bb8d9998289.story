Laid to rest: Prince Joshua Avitto, six, was fatally stabbed in a Brooklyn, New York elevator on Sunday

Hundreds of people from all walks of life, some crying and others wearing photo-emblazoned T-shirts, have gathered to mourn a six-year-old Brooklyn boy stabbed in a public housing project elevator.

Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Rev. Al Sharpton attended a private wake in New York on Friday before the funeral of Prince Joshua Avitto, known as P.J.

The 1000-strong line of relatives, friends and community members stretched around the block outside the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in the East New York neighborhood.

'It's very hard for me to say how very sad I am today,' said his father, Nicholas Avitto. 'Our greatest joy and pleasure was my son.'

Taj Gibson, a relative and a player 
for the Chicago Bulls, was there, as were the team's coach, Tom 
Thibodeau, and staff from the first-grader's school.

Slideshows of the smiling boy were displayed above the church's main stage.

'We've
 come today to celebrate P.J.'s life,' the Rev. David Brawley said. 'But
 we must acknowledge that his life was ended way too soon.'

Among
 the flower arrangements placed on the altar was a Superman-themed 
bouquet, an ode to P.J.'s 'Superman' nickname.

His body was taken out in
 a small white casket and put into the hearse to go to a crematorium for
 a private, family-only service.

On Thursday, police charged a recently
 released convict with murder and other crimes in Sunday's attack which killed P.J. and critically wounded seven-year-old Mikayla Capers, his 
friend.

Police said Daniel 
St. Hubert is also a suspect in the Wednesday stabbing of a homeless man
 on a Manhattan subway platform and the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old 
Tanaya Copeland a week ago, just blocks from the Brooklyn elevator 
attack. He is not charged in those crimes.

Investigators are now reviewing all stabbings citywide that have occurred since St. Hubert was freed on May 23.

St. Hubert, 27, served time for attempted murder and assault.

Court records show he was arrested in May 2009 after punching his mother in the face, choking her with an electrical cord and stealing her car. He pleaded guilty in July 2012.

St. Hubert was expected to get a new lawyer on Friday, according to the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
