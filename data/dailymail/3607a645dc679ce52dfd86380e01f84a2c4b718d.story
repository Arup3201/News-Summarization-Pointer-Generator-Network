Clubbers tend to burn between 500 and 600 calories per hour dancing non-stop - the same number you would during a high-impact aerobics class.

And now a team of music-mad exercise fanatics in London have combined the two, creating an aerobic rave workout that will leave you feeling energised the next day - as opposed to hungover.

Fitness Freak's pop-up rave class is an intensely choreographed aerobic session with a live DJ spinning 90s dance classics. All you need to do is turn up in your finest neon gym gear clutching a handful of glo-sticks.

The evening class combines cardio, conditioning, toning and stretching to a thumping soundtrack, all set against a backdrop of fluorescent multi-coloured disco lights.

One participant who took part in the last rave class said: 'It was the perfect combination of a fun workout, neon outfits and my favourite 90s dance hits. With glow sticks highlighting our every move, it was a non-stop underground fitness party.'

The one-hour pop-up rave is taking place at the Camden Centre on Euston Road in King's Cross in association with Time Out for two nights only, Tuesday 17 and Wednesday 18 September.

There will be four sessions and limited tickets available. To book visit the Fitness Freak website.

With swirling neon lights, a live DJ playing club classics, a choreographed routine and a roomful of people with bags of energy, you might mistake the rave aerobics class for a flashmob

In a room in east London at 6.30am, 
200 people are dancing to deep house club anthems, waving their arms 
about, whooping and cheering, and generally getting pretty excited.

It's a rave, yes, but not as you know them.

This
is not an after-party. These people have not dragged their weary selves
from a club to an underground bunker in which to continue their 
slcohol-soaked merriment. These people are stone-cold sober, have just 
woken up and are about to go to work.

Welcome to the world of early morning raving. Welcome to Morning Glory.

Wake up.... stretch.... put your trainers on.... head to Morning Glory for a pre-breakfast rave before going to work

The premise of the monthly event - 
whose subhead is 'rave your way into the day' - is to turn clubbing on 
its head and allow music fiends to embrace beats and bass without 
alcohol, and to rev themselves up for the day through dancing.

DJ
Marcus Veda, who provided the soundtrack to the event at Village 
Underground as The Loose Cannons with his DJ partner Julien Davis, told 
MailOnline: 'We came straight from playing at Secret Garden Party 
festival and the energy in the club was the same as it had been there. 
People were so energised. A lot of people were really getting their 
sweat on.'

Marcus,
who also takes rave to the yoga generation when he DJs for outdoor yoga
classes in Covent Garden, added: 'Most people there were about to go to
work, and some of them looked a bit bewildered at first, but then 
everyone really started getting into the music.

'It's clubbing with a good, happy vibe, and none of that dark edge. People were genuinely happy.'

Organisers hope to make the event a weekly occurrence, and The Loose Cannons hope to be asked back.

'It
was free-form exercise. It came from the idea that people go to 
aerobics or the gym in the morning, and this is like that without it 
being structured.

'It's
like clubbing, but instead of crawling out into the darkness afterwards
feeling horrible, you go to work feeling great. And instead of having a
beer you have coffee, a croissant and a massage.'

The next drop-in event is scheduled for Wednesday 4 September.

Is an early-morning rave exactly what you need to feel energised in the morning?
