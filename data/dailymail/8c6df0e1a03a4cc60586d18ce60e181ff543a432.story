Madonna has been branded 'disrespectful' after apparently comparing herself to Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela and Bob Marley in a bid to promote her new album.

In a series of Twitter and Instagram posts, the 56-year-old singer compared her '#rebelheart' to those of the civil rights activist, South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and reggae musician.

The Queen of Pop did so by transposing her new album's artwork - which features her face covered in black rope - onto iconic images of the trio, before posting the Photoshopped pictures online.

Alongside the photo of King - who famously delivered his 'I Have A Dream' speech during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom - she wrote: 'This #rebelheart had a dream!'

Controversial: Madonna has come under fire after transposing her new album's artwork - featuring her face covered in black rope - onto images of Martin Luther King Jr (pictured), Nelson Mandela and Bob Marley

Comparison: Alongside the photo of King - who famously delivered his 'I have a dream' speech during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom - the Queen of Pop wrote: 'This #rebelheart had a dream!'

Album cover: Madonna's new album, Rebel Heart (pictured), is scheduled for release on March 10 this year

Madonna captioned the black-and-white image of Mandela - who served as South African president from 1994 to 1999 and died last year - 'This #rebelheart fought for freedom!'

And she wrote, 'This #rebelheart sang about ONE LOVE!', alongside the picture of Marley. 

Within minutes of the images being posted to Twitter and Instagram, users across the world had taken to the social network sites to express their disgust at Madonna's apparent album promotion.

One Twitter user, named Jaime, told the Like A Virgin star: 'I know you're trying to make a statement, @Madonna, but you have enough resources to know this is offensive.'

Meanwhile, another, with the handle @SwagofDoom, tweeted: 'This is not beautiful. This is disrespectful and distasteful. How dare you.' And one user said: 'Is this really what I'm looking at?'

 On Instagram, user beate_abbey wrote: 'To lessen Mandela's and Dr. King's achievements as far as making their faces involuntarily a part of a marketing campaign for some irrelevant pop music is just a huge perception disorder.'

In December, Madonna was forced to release six songs from her new album  after 13 unfinished demos were leaked online, including Rebel Heart, Unapologetic B***h and B***h I'm Madonna.

At the time, the singer branded the invasion 'artistic-rape' in a now-deleted Instagram post.

'Offensive': One user, named Jaime, told the Like A Virgin star, who is currently skiing in Switzerland: 'I know you're trying to make a statement, @Madonna, but you have enough resources to know this is offensive'

Angry: Meanwhile, another, dubbed 'highgyal', tweeted the star: 'This is not beautiful. This is disrespectful'

In agreement: This user also dubbed the Photoshopped images - which were uploaded today - 'disrespectful'

In another post, the mother-of-four thanked her fans who did not listen to the leaked tracks, saying: 'Thank you for not listening! Thank you for your loyalty!

'Thank you for waiting and if you have heard please know they are unfinished demos stolen long ago and not ready to be presented to the world.'

Earlier today, Madonna was spotted skiing with her son David Banda and a group of male friends in the luxury  resort of Gstaad in south-west Switzerland. 

Wearing a blue coat and cheekily waving at onlookers, her adopted son, Malawi, was  clearly having a good time with the Grammy winner and her friends.

Family snap: On New Year's Eve, the superstar took to her Instagram account to share a snapshot of her daughter Lourdes, 18, giving her son Rocco, 14, a kiss on the cheek as he playfully grimaced (pictured)

Meanwhile, Madonna wrapped up against the snow in a fur trimmed black jacket and matching trousers, as well as a pair of orange goggles.

Two days earlier, the superstar had taken to her Instagram account to share a snapshot of her daughter Lourdes, 18, giving her son Rocco, 14, a kiss on the cheek as he playfully grimaced. 

 She captioned the New Year's Eve photograph: '2 halves of my #rebelheart #livingforlove'.

Rebel Heart is scheduled for release on March 10 this year.
