Her career may have taken a nose dive of late - but that didn't stop Sean Young from getting in on some A-list action at last night's Oscars before her unceremonious arrest.

The former Blade Runner actress is seen here posing with Hollywood royalty - including Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt - just hours before she was arrested after allegedly slapping a security guard at an Academy Awards after party.

The 52-year-old actress - who hasn't been in a major film since 2008 - also posed with the likes of Michelle Williams, Glenn Close and Sandra Bullock.

She has posted her trophy photographs 
on her Facebook page this morning - and issued a strong statement 
insisting she didn't do anything wrong - and saying she has a case for 
legal action after becoming 'bruised' in the fracas.

Young also insisted she was 'sober' 
and 'extremely well behaved when a stupid security guard went postal on 
me'. She says police have taken photographs of bruises on her arm and hinted at legal action against the Academy unless she gets a public 
apology.

TMZ claims the drama unravelled after Young tried to get into the Governor's Ball post-Oscars party without a ticket.

It is alleged she slapped a security guard after she returned to try and get in a second time and was led away by security.

Young was then arrested and taken away by police and booked for battery.

The divorced mother-of-two still 
appeared to be recovering from the partying as she gave a rambling 
interview after her release from custody.

Young,
who shot to fame in Blade Runner playing opposite Harrison Ford, has 
seen her career fade of late - to such an extent that she recently 
agreed to appear in the reality show Skating With The Stars.

Hitting out: The actress took to her Facebook account today, insisting she was sober and 'extremely well behaved'

But
sadly her comeback did not last long as she was eliminated in the 
second show of the ABC series in November after falling onto the ice 
twice.

Drama: Young, 52, allegedly argued with a guard at the Governor's Ball last night, pictured here earlier this week at a pre-Oscars brunch

Young
was seen leaving a police station in Los Angeles at 1:45am on Monday 
and said the incident began as she was waiting to enter the party.

'I'm
OK,' she told TMZ on being released from the police station. 'The 
Academy's lawyer recommended that a private person's arrest be made.

'I was standing outside the cord, waiting and seeing friends that were going up to the Governor's Ball,' she told TMZ.

Young said she was 'carted off to spend four hours at the Hollywood police', adding 'shame on you (the Academy) for that.'

Los
Angeles Police Sergeant Enrique Mendoza confirmed the arrest but 
wouldn't give details about the incident or the alleged victim.

The Governor's Ball is the official 
Oscar party and is held above the film award show's venue, the Hollywood
& Highland Theatre.

She
posted bail of $20,000 early on Monday morning. An Academy of Motion 
Arts and Sciences spokesman did not immediately comment.

The incident is not her first issue at
an Oscars after party. She tried to get into a Vanity Fair party by 
sneaking in behind Jennifer Aniston in 2006.

But she was escorted out by four guards when spotted by security.

Young said of the incident in a recent
interview: 'It was degrading. But when you have nothing to lose, it's 
really not that big of a deal.â€™

She shot to fame in 1982 in the sci-fi 
thriller Blade Runner. She then starred in hit films including No Way 
Out and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.

Young, of Louisville, Kentucky, also had
roles in TV shows including One Tree Hill and more recently daytime 
show The Young and the Restless.

She married Robert Lujan in 1990 
before divorcing him 12 years later in 2002 - but they had two boys 
together, named Quinn and Rio.

One
famous incident was in 1992 when she arrived at the Batman Returns set 
in a homemade Catwoman suit after she lost out on playing the part.

Young voluntarily went into rehab for 
treatment of an alcohol problem in January 2008, after she had struggled
against addiction for many years.
