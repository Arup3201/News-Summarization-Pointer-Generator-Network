Tens of thousands more teenagers received the wrong grade in GCSE English this summer than previously thought, it emerged last night.

As many as 67,000 youngsters were unfairly denied a C grade due to last-minute changes to grade bands, according to research.

The analysis suggests that previous claims that 10,000 pupils had been affected seriously underestimate the problem.

The figures emerged amid a simmering row 
over a sudden drop in GCSE results this summer – the first in the 
24-year history of the exam.

Last minute changes to grade boundaries meant that many pupils missed out on a C in English

Concern has mainly focused on English, where the proportion gaining C grades or better dipped 1.5 points from 65.4 per cent last year to 63.9 per cent.

Head teachers claim that pupils who took English exams in January stood a better chance of getting a good grade than those who entered in June.

They believe that exam boards unfairly raised grade boundaries for exams taken in summer to prevent severe grade inflation.

Now a detailed study of the impact of grade boundary movements – carried out by David Blow, headmaster of The Ashcombe School, Dorking, Surrey – suggests that tens of thousands of pupils have been affected. The analysis looked at what would have happened to pupils who sat exams in June if the January grade boundaries remained in place.

It suggests that half the 133,906 candidates who received a D in English in June would have been in line for Cs had the boundaries not been moved.

‘The numbers of pupils potentially 
involved could amount to many tens of thousands of candidates,’ Mr Blow 
told the Times Educational Supplement.

Brian Lightman, general secretary of 
the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘The more feedback 
we get the more serious this crisis has proved itself to be.’

The study also suggested that pupils on the border between C and D were harder hit than their higher-achieving classmates.

Pupils who scraped a C in an English 
language coursework unit on understanding texts and creative writing in 
January would have needed to score four extra marks to achieve the same 
grade in June, it emerged.

Some schools experienced a significant reduction in the numbers of students achieving A* to C grades in English

However, a candidate who just scraped an A in January on the same unit would have needed no extra marks to achieve the same grade in June.

Mr Lightman said the changes would have a ‘devastating effect’ on pupils just missing out on a C.

‘A C grade or above in GCSE English is the key to so many career paths,’ he said.

‘There is a massive issue here, particularly for the Government’s social mobility agenda as many of these pupils are from areas of high deprivation.’

In a series of questions and answers posted on its website, Ofqual, the standards watchdog investigating claims of unfairness, admitted some schools had seen grades vary wildly compared with teachers’ predictions.

‘Overall, GCSE English pass rates at A* to C grade fell by 1.5 per cent, but some schools appear to have experienced much more significant reductions in achievement as compared with their own teacher predictions,’ it said. It denied it had been ‘leant on by the Government’ to crack down on grade inflation.

A spokesman for the exam board involved, AQA, said: ‘Grade boundaries change between exam series by different amounts at different grades. This is a normal feature of the assessment process.’
