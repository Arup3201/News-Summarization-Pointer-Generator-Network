Ambulances will be given longer to reach all but the most serious calls, NHS bosses have today revealed.

Pilot schemes being run in parts of the country will give emergency call handlers an extra two minutes to decide whether to despatch an ambulance.

Current rules mean call handlers have just 60 seconds to gather the information they need.

The short time limit has prompted concerns that ambulances are being sent to patients who do not need them.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs the changes will 'improve patient safety'. 

Emergency call handlers will be given two minutes extra to decide whether to send an ambulance to patients, in all but the most serious, life-threatening calls, NHS England have said

In a written statement to Parliament, he said giving staff 'very limited extra assessment time would ensure that ambulances are better deployed to where they are most needed and would allow a faster response time for those patients who really need it'.

'There is significant evidence to suggest that giving call handlers extra assessment time to make the right decision for the patient could improve clinical outcomes and improve their chances of survival,' he said.

It comes after the health secretary asked NHS England to consider new measures to help address 'an unprecedented increase in demand on ambulance services' in the last two months.

The new arrangements will be put in place in pilot areas in the areas covered by the London Ambulance Service and the South West Ambulance Service.

The plans will give call handlers up to 120 seconds longer to get all the information they need from a person making a non-life-threatening 999 call before deciding on the right response.

Mr Hunt said the new plans will not include those calls which are immediately life-threatening - categorised as Red 1 calls and requiring a response time within eight minutes. 

The first pilot is expected to start in February, NHS England said.

Professor Keith Willett, NHS England's national director for acute care, said: 'We are piloting these new arrangements because on medical grounds, we believe they will increase the availability of ambulance vehicles and paramedic staff, providing patients with a better service and improving their chances of survival, especially those with the most serious conditions.'

In the pilot sites, a small number of potentially life threatening conditions, such as overdoses and certain types of gunshot wounds, will also be upgraded from the Red 2 category into the higher-priority Red 1 category so they receive a faster response than is currently the case.

Professor Willett said: 'It's not about relaxing standards. 

'By acting with slightly less haste on the calls, we believe we can get to more patients with more speed. 

'Some conditions will be upgraded to Red 1 status, requiring a more urgent response than is currently the case.'

NHS England said evidence shows that less than 10 per cent of 999 calls are for genuinely life-threatening conditions, yet currently around 40 per cent are classified as such, partly due to the lack of time the call handler has before the clock starts for determining whether an ambulance has arrived within the target time. 

To meet the current target of reaching 75 per cent of patients categorised as Red 2 within eight minutes, ambulance trusts frequently send vehicles to 999 callers before they have determined the exact nature of the problem.

They may also send more than one vehicle, such as an ambulance and a rapid responder.

On average, more than 20 per cent of vehicles are cancelled before reaching the scene, wasting resources which could be used for other patients.

Mr Hunt said: 'At present, ambulance services are allowed only 60 seconds before the clock starts to decide what the right course of action is for that individual patient.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt said giving staff 'very limited extra assessment time would ensure that ambulances are better deployed to where they are most needed and would allow a faster response time for those patients who really need it'

'This sometimes leads to ambulances being dispatched unnecessarily, so that fewer ambulances are available for patients who really do need emergency assistance.' 

Mr Hunt said  an extension of the pilot scheme would not be permitted unless three tests were met:

He said the changes were being considered 'in light of the unprecedented increase in demand for ambulance services in the last two months'.

Dr Anthony Marsh, chair of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives and Chief Executive of West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust and the East of England Ambulance Service Trust, said the changes will save lives. 

'These changes will ensure that those people with the most serious conditions get the most urgent response, which will protect patients and save lives,' he said.

'The changes will also allow us to provide patients with the right level of care so that they get the best possible outcome. 

'This is a change that our staff, who know the system better than anyone, have been pushing for as they know it will save countless lives.'

Currently 999 operators have just 60 seconds to make their decision

Prompted concerns ambulances are being sent unnecessarily 

@highlight

Experts say it is not about 'relaxing standards' adding that some gunshot wounds and overdoses will be upgraded to require faster response times

@highlight

There is a clear clinical consensus that the changes will be beneficial to patient outcomes as a whole, and will act to reduce overall clinical risk in the system

@highlight

There is evidence from the analysis of existing data and piloting that the proposed changes will have the intended benefits, and is safe for patients 

@highlight

There is an associated increase in operational efficiency. The aim is to reduce the average number of vehicles allocated to each 999 call and the ambulance utilisation rate
