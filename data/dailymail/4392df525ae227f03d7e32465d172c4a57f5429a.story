A father and son are charged in connection with the death of a man whose body was found behind a school in Norwood.

Prosecutors said 66-year-old Vincent Lalli was killed in Somerville, where he shared an apartment with the two men. Lalli's body was found Jan. 29.

Fifty-two-year-old Anthony Canejo Sr. pleaded not guilty in Somerville District Court to armed assault with intent to murder and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

His son, thirty-year-old Anthony Canejo Jr. pleaded not guilty to accessory charges.

Prosecutors allege the father beat Lalli with a crowbar and strangled him, and the son helped dispose of Lalli's body which was dumped behind a Norwood middle school.

According to a police report, the murder may have all been about money and lottery tickets.

Tony Canejo, Sr., 52, is a convicted Level 3 sex offender.

The police report says Canejo Sr. killed Lalli, first hitting him with a crow bar in Lalli's bedroom and then strangling him with bare hands on Jan. 24.

Fox News reports, the day before the murder, a witness gave Lalli nearly $8,000, money owed on a lottery ticket Lalli won.

Lalli turned around and bought two books of scratch tickets, and still had $6400 on him.

Police say they never recovered any of the cash, and that shortly after the murder, Canejo Sr. and his son were recorded on video cashing in some winning scratch tickets.

Canejo Sr. is held without bail until a hearing on Feb. 21. His son is held without bail on an alleged probation violation and on $250,000 cash bail on the new charges.

Fallout: All three men shared a house together in Somerville

Lalli's dismembered remains were found in several plastic bags. Two blood soaked suitcases and a blood drenched towel were also found at the scene. Lalliâ€™s body was identified through fingerprints, the DA said.

Lalli was described as a Navy veteran who served in Vietnam and was the father of an 11-year-old son.
