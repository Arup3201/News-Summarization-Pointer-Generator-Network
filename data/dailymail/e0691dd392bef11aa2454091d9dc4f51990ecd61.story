An Arizona mother is furious after her two-year-old son's former daycare center posted a public warning with his picture online accusing him of 'biting'.

After kicking little Ryan Jones out of Tiny Tots in Chandler for allegedly biting a child, co-owner Carmella Sul uploaded an image of the toddler to Craigslist with a severe warning: 'Beware of this kid, he bites'.

'I was sick as any parent would be if they saw their child on the internet,' Ryan's distressed mother Maggie Jones told Dateline’s Wild Wild Web program, which investigated complaints against the family-run center.

The online feud began when Jones' five-year-old son, who also attended the center, started complaining he wasn't getting enough food.

Jones said she contacted Sul, telling her the daily fee should cover all meals.

Soon after, both boys were kicked out. 

'She [Sul] stated that my two-year-old had bit another child,' Jones told Dateline.

Jones, disappointed after initially believing the center was 'perfect' for her boys, posted an online listing warning parents to stay away from Sul.

That's when Sul retaliated, posting Ryan’s photo online and warning other daycare operators that he was a 'biter'.

But Sul took the matter even further by sending Jones an aggressive text message: 'Your kid is a dog and he keeps biting'.

While the state of Arizona has reportedly not received any formal complaints against the business owners, Dateline found several parents have had run-ins with them.

Michelle Thomas claimed her two sons were also kicked out of Tiny Tots without warning because the Suls claimed her 19-month-old son put another child in a 
chokehold.

When Sul thought that Thomas had posted a complaint online, the daycare owner emailed her saying: 'I hope you die and your kid.'

'To watch people’s children and you tell somebody’s mother
you hope them and their child die,' Thomas told Dateline.

'That’s . . . I don’t 
know about that.'

Dateline also alleged the Suls should have applied for a childcare license because they had been caring for at least 10 children at any one time.

The center doesn't need a license if they look after a maximum of four children at a time.

Dateline spoke to Kelly Brown, a mother who removed her children from Tiny Tots after seeing more than a dozen kids at the center.

'I visited about two weeks ago and when I went in I counted 22 children,' Brown said.

'Every seat in the dining room was covered. Every spot on the couch, on the floor. And there were five kids by the gate.'

The Suls admitted there were sometimes more kids at their center than there should be.

'Usually there are five kids,' Maria Sul told Dateline. 'We did have some extra ones today.'

Maria Sul also said she remembered Ryan Jones: 'The little biter. He likes biting kids.'

Meanwhile Carmella Sul defended her decision to post the warning on Craigslist: 'I had to warn other day care providers that that kid bites.'
