This is the moment a brother and sister met for the first time in 31 years.

John Pilotte, 47, was adopted in New Orleans and lost all contact with his biological father more than 20 years ago.

Unbeknownst to him, his father had two more children 16 years later in Wisconsin.

Ecstatic: John Pilotte, 47, and Susie Wilson, 31, ran at each other when they finally met for the first time

Embrace: Susie flew from Green Bay to New Orleans to meet John, who her father gave up for adoption

Discovery: They made contact after Susie found John on Facebook and called him on Thanksgiving 2011

But it wasn't until Thanksgiving 2011 that he discovered his secret siblings when he received a phone call from Susie Wilson - who had found him on Facebook.

'I'm your sister,' she told him.

John balked: 'I just said "excuse me? I think you've got the wrong number!"'

They talked for an hour, and it sparked an incredibly close friendship.

Grew up apart: John (pictured left) never knew he had a brother and sister (right) more than 1,000 miles away

Nervous: John said he felt like he was waiting for a first date as he nervously stood in the airport lounge

Similarities: The pair said they realized in the past few years of texting and calling that they are very similar

Finally, after three years of texting and calling, Susie, 31, was able to fly over from Green Bay last weekend.

Tearfully waiting at the airport, John beamed when his sister emerged, screaming: 'I've been waiting for this my whole life!'

'I left my waterproof mascara in my bag, so I have to hold it together,' she told WGNO-TV.

Friendship: They went to a Saints game while Susie was visiting and are now planning a trip to California

'There are some moments I’m never going to forget: marrying my wife, having my child and meeting my sister is up there,' Pilotte said, as he set off for a weekend with his wife and son, his new sister, and her fiancee. 

'Everything going on this weekend; it’s almost like it’s supposed to happen this way.'

John now plans to meet his other sibling - a brother based in California.
