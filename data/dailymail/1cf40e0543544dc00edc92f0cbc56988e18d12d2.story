A vulnerable woman who was left without heating in her council-run supported accommodation was found dead, wrapped in a duvet after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning as she desperately tried to keep warm.

Irene Simpson, 59, was discovered at her home in Wigston, Leicester, by her son-in-law, Andrew Athill, huddled in a duvet and clutching a hot water bottle next to a camping stove-style heater last December.

She had also been burning charcoal in a metal bowl on the hob of her cooker in a bid to keep warm more than six months after her heating broke down.

An inquest at Leicester Town Hall today heard that Ms Simpson, who had been diagnosed with a life-threatening heart condition and mental health issues, had not had central heating or hot water in her home since May 2012.

Her heating broke down when council maintenance workers had turned off and condemned a faulty combination boiler at her premises.

HM Coroner for Leicester, Catherine Mason, heard how the divorced grandmother-of-three had been moved by the local council from an independent living ground floor flat, into a supported housing bungalow.

But when her worried family couldn’t get hold of her, on December 4 last year, they broke into her house using a crow bar - and found her dead, fully clothed and clutching a hot water bottle.

It was only when toxicology tests, taken during the post mortem, revealed that carbon monoxide was a factor in Ms Simpson’s death that questions arose regarding gas safety checks carried out at the property.

The family discovered the bungalow’s combination boiler had been condemned and had been turned off back in May.

The inquest heard that the grandmother had not told her daughters, Stephanie Wakeling and Lisa Simpson, that she was living without any heating -and had made excuses for her daughters not to visit her at home.

In a statement, son-in-law Andrew, who found her body, told the inquest: 'Irene’s two dogs were very aggressive when I entered the property, but as soon as I saw her I knew she was dead.'

The inquest was told by a pathologist that the 59-year-old had died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning - but because of her existing heart condition, she succumbed to the poison more quickly than the average person would have.

However, it has not yet been determined whether the carbon monoxide came from the gas heater or from the charcoal which had been burned on the cooker.

Sally Lowe, housing officer from Oadby & Wigston Borough Council, was visibly distressed when she told the inquest that during a visit in August, Ms Simpson had told housing officers that she didn’t want any heating.

She said: 'Irene wouldn’t engage with anyone in any way.

'She was a very difficult tenant, and any time we wanted to enter her property, we needed to get a police officer.

'When we asked her about the boiler, Irene said that she didn’t want the heating, she said she’d have it in the winter when it got colder, but she didn’t want it.'

Jay Stemp, the council’s property manager, admitted that the council had left Ms Simpson waiting for three months over the summer before making any attempt to fix her boiler.

He said: 'Normally, a broken boiler would have been fixed within one or two days.

'In this case, for some reason, the problem wasn’t logged at the time when it should have been.

'The cooker and the gas fire in her property were still working, it was just her boiler.

'Calor gas fuelled heating is very common in properties, but I’ve never seen charcoal being burned. It’s very dangerous.'

Council officials admitted that it took three month before they even attempted to access the property to fix the boiler.

Coroner Catherine Mason said: 'It is very clear that what has happened should not have happened.

'There was a failure in communication.

'However, throughout the period, Irene maintained her independence, and could have asked for help.'

She adjourned the inquest until December 2.

Tony Hannington, a partner with Lime solicitors, who is representing Mrs Simpson’s family, commented: 'We are grateful to the coroner for investigating Irene’s tragic and untimely death.

'They still have many questions regarding their mother’s death, and we await the coroner’s verdict next month.'
