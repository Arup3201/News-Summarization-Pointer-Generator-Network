Nasa’s most advanced mobile robotic laboratory, which will examine one of the most intriguing areas on Mars, is in final preparations for a launch from Florida's Space Coast on November 25.

The Mars Science Laboratory mission will carry Curiosity, a rover with more scientific capability than any ever sent to another planet.

It will set down inside a huge crater and use its highly advanced instruments, including cameras and lasers, to find out more about the planet’s environment, which will help pave the way for human missions.

Size matters: The Mars Science Laboratory is the biggest and most sophisticated planet-roaming machine ever to be deployed

Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at Nasa Headquarters in Washington, said: ‘Mars Science Laboratory builds upon the improved understanding about Mars gained from current and recent missions.

‘This mission advances technologies and science that will move us toward missions to return samples from, and eventually send humans to, Mars.’

Scheduled to land on the Red Planet in August 2012, the one-ton rover will examine Gale Crater during a mission that will last nearly two years.

Curiosity will land near the base of a layered mountain three miles (five kilometres) high inside the crater.

The rover will investigate whether environmental conditions ever have been favourable for development of microbial life and preserved evidence of those conditions.

John Grotzinger, project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said: ‘Gale gives us a superb opportunity to test multiple potentially habitable environments and the context to understand a very long record of early environmental evolution of the planet.

‘The portion of the crater where Curiosity will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water-carried sediments. Layers at the base of the mountain contain clays and sulphates, both known to form in water.’

Curiosity is twice as long and five times as heavy as earlier Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity.

The rover will carry a set of 10 science instruments weighing 15 times as much as its predecessors' science payloads.

A mast extending to seven feet (2.1 metres) above ground provides height for cameras and a laser-firing instrument to study targets from a distance.

Instruments on a seven-foot-long (2.1-metre-long) arm will study targets up close.

Analytical instruments inside the rover will determine the composition of rock and soil samples acquired with the arm's powdering drill and scoop.

Other instruments will characterise the environment, including the weather and natural radiation that will affect future human missions.

The rover is now sitting on top of an Atlas V rocket awaiting lift-off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

‘Preparations are on track for launching at our first opportunity,’ said Pete Theisinger, Mars Science Laboratory project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

‘If weather or other factors prevent launching then, we have more opportunities through to December 18.’
