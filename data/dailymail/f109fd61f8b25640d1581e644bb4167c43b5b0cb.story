Wales will consider switching prolific Lions wing, George North, into midfield for their autumn Test opener against Australia, if Jonathan Davies’ shoulder injury rules him out.

North has been in sensational form for Northampton in the early stages of this season – touching down four times during Saturday’s 34-6 Champions Cup demolition of the Ospreys. That took his try tally to eight in as many matches, but the 22-year-old may be asked to move from his preferred position out wide, as emergency cover.

Although Wales are hopeful that Scott Williams and Cory Allen could be fit to face the Wallabies, they will weigh up the option of unleashing North through the middle, as they did against the same opposition last year. ‘George went there (centre) last year against Australia,’ said assistant coach Rob Howley.

Jonathan Davies injured his shoulder playing for Clermont  on the Sunday and could miss the autumn Tests 

‘We think George isn’t a bad outside centre. He did okay on the wing as well on the weekend, which was fantastic to see. He was back to his Lions form. It is an option for us if we need to go there.’

That scenario will be pondered once the extent of Davies’ injury is known by head coach Warren Gatland and his assistants. Initial reports in France – where the Lions centre plays for Clermont Auvergne – suggested he may have dislocated his shoulder during the first half of Sunday’s win over Sale. Wales should have a clearer picture by Tuesday.

‘Jonathan had a bump on his shoulder and we are uncertain as to the extent of the injury,’ said Howley. ‘A scan has been organised. He obviously felt some pain and came off immediately. It is disappointing, but centre is a pretty attritional position now. It’s no different to other campaigns – we just have to get on and work with what we’ve got.’

Williams and Allen arrived in camp with hamstring and leg injuries respectively, but the Wales management believe they could be ready for the start of the autumn campaign. ‘Scott and Cory could potentially be fit for next week,’ said Howley.

Meanwhile, the Wallabies are prepared to summon controversial back Kurtley Beale to join their tour providing he proves his fitness – despite his latest disciplinary episode. The Waratahs player was suspended and then fined after being found guilty of sending an offensive text about a former member of the team’s back-room staff.

Yet, it appears Beale once again has been forgiven by Australia and will be reintegrated soon. ‘Kurtley is back at home training,’ said defence coach, Nathan Grey. ‘He hasn’t played for a long time. We know he’s working hard, trying to get back up to speed with his physical condition and once he’s done that he will definitely be considered for selection. He could possibly join us on this tour once he gets back in shape.’

New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter expects to make a Test comeback against the USA on Saturday – putting him on course to face England at Twickenham a week later, after a year decimated by injuries. ‘I’m preparing to play that game,’ he said, of the sell-out fixture in Chicago. ‘I’m confident and the medical team are confident that I’ll be able to be selected. That’s what we’re targeting.’
