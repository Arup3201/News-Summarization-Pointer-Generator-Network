They have fought on battlefields and in courtrooms for the return of the land that once belonged to them.

And now - 150 years after the sacred, mountainous land in South Dakota's Black Hills was taken from them by the U.S. government - the Sioux are desperately trying to raise $9million to get it returned.

However, the bid has sparked controversy among the native American tribesman, many of whom are angry that they are being forced to buy back land that once belonged to them.

Sioux tribesman on the plains of South Dakota: The Sioux have an ancient association with the Black Hills

Disputed land: The Reynolds Prairie in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The ranch - nearly 2,000 acres - encompasses the sacred site of Pe' Sla

Tom Poor Bear, the vice president of 
the Oglala Lakota Tribe in South Dakota, told the New York Times: 'It’s like someone stealing my car and I 
have to pay to get it back.'

A portion of the rolling range of mountains, given the name of called Pe' Sla by the Lakota Sioux tribes, was offered for sale earlier this year.

The family that have controlled the land since 1876 - the year that General George Armstrong Custer died - have accepted a bid for the land made by more than half a dozen Sioux tribes.

The group, which includes some of the country's poorest people, is now scrambling to raise the $9million needed to buy back the land before next month's deadline, the New York Times reported.

The move is the latest in a long and 
controversial battle over ownership of the land after the United States 
broke several treaties when it took it from the natives.

The
government's seizure of the Black Hills was described as one of the 
most dishonourable acts in American history in a landmark federal court 
decision in 1979.

The SIoux
tribes have been blighted by poverty and unemployment for generations. 
If they cannot raise the money they stand to lose their sacred land as 
well as a $900,000 initial payment they put down.

Sioux tribal leaders from all over the Great Plains will meet this week to devise a strategy to come up with the remaining $8.1million by November 30.

'Our ceremonial patterns would collapse': The current owners have always allowed the Sioux to access the land for prayer rituals

Way of life: If the Sioux fail in their bid to buy Pe' Sla they say their culture could 'come to an end'

The current owners - the Reynolds family - have always allowed the Sioux to access the land for prayer ceremonies.

However, if the Sioux fail in their bid to buy Pe' Sla they say their culture could 'come to an end' if the land was bought by an owner who prevented them from visiting, effectively finishing 3,000 years of annual pilgrimages.

Victor Douville, who teaches Lakota history and culture 
at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, told the New York Times: 'Our ceremonial patterns would 
collapse.'

Heading the purchase bid is the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. It's treasurer Louis Wayne Boyd said: 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get some land back that is very, very dear to us.

'Most of the tribes want to do something, but it’s very difficult for them to raise any money, especially of this magnitude.'

Gold rush: A prospector in the Black Hills. The site was snatched back from the Sioux when gold was discovered

The Sioux have an ancient association with Pe' Sla, 1,942 acres of prairie in the heart of the Black Hills mountain range.

They consider Pe' Sla to be sacred and believe the site was once the setting of an epic battle between good and evil.

The Sioux honour this with an annual religious ceremony which welcomes the spring after a long winter.

In 1868, the Treaty of Fort Laramie granted them ownership but the mountains were taken back by the federal government when gold was discovered.

The area then became a hot spot for prospectors hoping to cash in on the gold rush.

The land was homesteaded by the Reynolds, a ranching family, since the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876.

Despite owning the land where the Lakota perform healing ceremonies, the Reynolds have allowed the Sioux to access the site.

However, they divided their 1,940 acres into five tracts which were sold at auction last month.

Pictures of the lot show the land to be a remote prairie where wild deer roam.

The U.S. Government was accused of using deplorable tactics from drive the Sioux from Pe' Sla before it appropriated the land, including starving them.

In 1979, more than 100 years later, the United States Courts of Claims said of the federal government's actions: 'A more ripe 
and rank case of dishonourable dealing will never, in all probability, be
found in our history.'

A year later, the Supreme Court ordered the government to compensate the Sioux for seizing the Black Hills site, but the tribes refused to accept the money.

They believe accepting compensation effectively condones the sale of the mountain and they instead have insisted Black Hills is returned to tribal authority.

Despite the fact the government compensation fund has grown to more than $800million as it sits in a bank account accumulating interest, the Sioux have refused to use the money to buy Pe' Sla.
