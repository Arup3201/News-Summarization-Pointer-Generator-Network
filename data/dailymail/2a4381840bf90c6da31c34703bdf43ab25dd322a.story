Floyd Mayweather was put through a gruelling workout on Tuesday as he continues his preparations for the $300million showdown with Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2.

The 38-year-old once again took to Instagram to document his rigorous training regime as he stepped up the pace in his latest gym session in Los Angeles.

Mayweather uploaded a video to the social media site showing him working on his hand speed as he trained on the pads and the bag.

The undefeated American displays incredible movement while he grimaces with pain as he pushed himself to the limit to ensure he is in the best possible shape to take on Pacquiao at the MGM Grand.

Meanwhile, Mayweather has reserved special praise for his personal chef, who will be fuelling him during the build up to the mega fight.

The WBA and WBC welterweight champion posted a a video while his chef was preparing food insisting she is the 'best chef in the world' and that she will be 'with me until I die'.

Both fighters had agreed to unannounced blood and urine testing without reservation and will be tested out of competition prior to the fight and in competition after the fight.

An inspector made a surprise visit to the house where Pacquiao is staying earlier this week to take the Filipino's sample.

The PacMan readily complied with tests for both blood – a process about which he had previously expressed his dislike – and urine.

‘No problem,’ he told the medic, with a smile.
