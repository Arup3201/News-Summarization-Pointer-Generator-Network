Uruguay has become the first country in the world to legalise marijuana after passing a law which allows the production, sale and use of the drug.

Last night hundreds of cannabis-smoking supporters cheered and set off fireworks as they celebrated the new legislation in the centre of the capital, Montevideo.

The law permits both the large-scale distribution of marijuana and the growing of small amounts by individuals - although it will be tightly controlled by the country's Left-wing government.

International groups have warned that Uruguay's legislation violates global treaties which state that narcotics should remain illegal in every country.

Senator Roberto Conde, of the ruling Broad Front, said that 'the war against drugs has failed' as he presented the bill, which was passed in the Senate by 16 votes out of 29.

Another senator, Alberto Couriel, added: 'It is an historic day. Uruguay is now on the international forefront of this issue.'

President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla fighter, has described the legalisation plan as an experiment, saying: 'There are a lot of doubts and the doubts are legitimate.

'But doubts shouldn't paralyse us in trying new paths to deal with this problem that has gripped us.'

Uruguay is the first country fully to legalise the production, distribution of sale of marijuana, but several other countries have relaxed their laws against the drug in recent years.

The Netherlands is well-known for its liberal policy on cannabis, and the capital Amsterdam is full of 'coffee shops' where residents and tourists can smoke weed, although production is still illegal.

Switzerland, Spain and Canada are among the many other states where the drug has been decriminalised for personal use, with official efforts directed against dealers and producers instead.

Last year the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington both voted to make the sale and use of marijuana legal - however, as it is still banned under federal law, the long-term functioning of the states' laws are uncertain.

In addition, 18 other American states allow the use of medical marijuana, and in some of those states it is so easy to obtain a licence for this that the drug is effectively decriminalised.

The law is much more liberal than in other places which have legalised aspects of marijuana use, such as the Netherlands or the American states of Colorado and Washington.

Anyone over 18 will be allowed to grow up to six marijuana plants each, join a cannabis club or buy up to 40 grams per month from a pharmacy, as long as they have registered with the government.

Valeria Rubino, an activist who has taken part in marches supporting the law, described it as 'another blow against social hypocrisy'.

However, opposition parties have opposed the measure, while pharmacists are angry that they will have to sell marijuana.

A poll taken in September suggested that 61 per cent of Uruguayans disapprove of the law.

Legalising cannabis will 'diminish the perception of risk and foster consumption, especially among children and adolescents,' said Alfredo Solari, a senator from the opposition Colorado Party.

'Neither our government nor the rest of the world should experiment with Uruguayans.'

Even some drug users oppose the measure, because they argue that the government controls on marijuana are overly restrictive.

'It's invasive, because it is not up to the government to determine how much marijuana can be consumed and the quality,' said Alicia Castilla, the author of a book on 'Cannabis Culture'.

The International Narcotics Control Board, which oversees international treaties on drugs, has warned that the law violates the Single Convention of Narcotic Drugs, adopted in 1961 by Uruguay and 185 other countries.

But following decades of drug-related violence throughout Latin America, a number of former leaders from the region have endorsed the plan.

Mr Conde insisted that the law will do nothing more than recognise what is already happening around the country.

'Marijuana is the illegal drug that is most consumed, fundamentally by young people, one that is perceived as extremely low risk and is easily obtained,' he said.

The government has accompanied the law with a publicity campaign featuring the slogan, 'All drug consumption has risks.'
