The family of a man who was run over and killed by his wife following an argument have slammed the courts for not jailing her.  

Kareen Pope was convicted in October of causing father-of-two George Pope's death by careless driving, but was spared jail and was sentenced instead to community service.

Mr Pope, 42, died after his estranged wife, 45, a qualified nurse, ploughed her car into him as he walked down the street in December 2012.

She had been giving Mr Pope a lift home in her Ford Focus when they argued about his drinking.

He was dropped off and got out to walk, but seconds later was hit by her car.

The 'slap on the wrists' sentence has outraged Mr Pope's distraught mother, Morag McManus.

Now, she is calling for the sentence to be reviewed, claiming it is 'unduly lenient'.

'The justice system has let us down,' said Mrs McManus, 67, from Paisley.

'It took the jury just half-an-hour to find her guilty of running him over, but the judge only gave her community service for killing her husband.

'It is just not right. I have been left without my son and we want to see justice for what happened to him.'

Pope, who is appealing her conviction, was initially arrested for causing her husband's death by dangerous driving.

However, the charge was dropped and replaced with the lesser offence of causing death by careless driving.

Her trial, at Paisley Sheriff Court, heard the couple had been arguing on December 6 2012.

The court heard Pope gave Mr Pope lift from their house to his flat, but instead of going inside, he staggered into the middle of the road.

Pope drove behind him for about 90ft before striking him, trapping him underneath the car.

Her son Glen Hodgkinson, 21, was also in the car with her at the time.

Paramedics who rushed to the scene were unable to save Mr Pope's life.

He was pronounced dead at the Royal Alexandra Hospital.

Last night, Mr Pope's sister, Christina Simmons, 33, said she burst into tears as Sheriff Robert Fife sentenced Pope to just 200 hours of community punishment.

Pope had been banned from driving for three years at an earlier hearing.

'I couldn't believe it,' the mother-of-two said.

'Even she thought she was going to jail - she had a rucksack and hold-all with her.

'But she turned the water-works on and was given unpaid work and a driving ban, all for taking somebody's life.

'It is disgusting.'

Mrs Simmons admitted the couple had a drink-fuelled and turbulent relationship, but described Mr Pope as a 'happy-go-lucky guy' who was 'loved by everyone'.

She added: 'When she killed George, she killed half of me as well. That is why I just can't let it go.'

Mrs Simmons is now backing an online petition set up by her brother's friend, Chris Beaton, calling for a review of evidence in the case.

Mr Beaton, 40, of Clydebank, said: 'There was evidence from George's family and friends about Kareen Pope's background that was never heard during her trial.

'We are very concerned about this and want the procurator fiscal to look into the case again.

'She is still living the life she used to, while George's friends and family know that he will never have that luxury.'

In October, qualified nurse Pope said she was left 'paralysed with shock' when she realised her estranged husband was pinned under her car.

She said: 'I had killed him. I had run over him in my car, killing him instantly, and I just broke down in hysterics.

'George was gone and it was all my fault.'

Pope said that before the incident she managed to get her 'alcoholic' partner 'into the back seat' with help from her son.

'After giving him a very good talking to, I dropped him off outside his house,' she told the court.

'But instead of going inside, he started staggering slowly in front of the car and refusing to move out of the way, so I had no option but to drive slowly behind him to get to the end of the narrow street.

'The road was dark as it was winter, but I could clearly see him in front of the car bonnet and he stumbled slightly then disappeared.

'I quickly did an emergency stop and looked at my son in a panic. I tried to reverse and, when the car wouldn't move, I realised George was under the car.

'I am a qualified nurse but I panicked when I saw him lying there. I just froze.

'He was my husband and I loved him and when I took his hand and held it, I knew he was dead.'

During the trial, Pope's lawyer, Manus Tolland, said: 'This incident is something that is going to live with her for the rest of her life.'

Sheriff Fife also told the hearing: 'This is a tragic case. She was careless, that is the bottom line, but I am not going to send her to jail. This is a very long and tragic case which has gone on for years.

'It is very sad.'

He added: 'I do not want to upset you. I am not going to send you to jail. You were careless and it had a terrible consequence.

'There needs to be an element of punishment for what took place. Now, you can put it behind you.'

Mrs McManus said she struggles to comprehend why the sheriff said he did not want to upset her son's ex.

She said: 'How can the sheriff tell her not to get upset and that he wouldn't jail her?

'I was furious with what he said, taking pity on George's ex but totally overlooking the feelings of his family.'

Mrs McManus said 'I have been left without my son and we want to see justice for what happened to him'

The procurator fiscal's office last night explained it 'has a limited right of appeal against sentence'.

A spokesman added that for an appeal against sentence to be successful, it must be outside the range of sentencing options which could be imposed.

Sentences for causing death by careless driving can range from ordering a re-test to five years' imprisonment.

The spokesman said it would therefore be 'inappropriate' for the procurator fiscal to appeal against Kareen Pope's sentence.

'We will be contacting Mr Pope's next-of-kin to explain the reasons for this decision to them,' he said.
