These are the first pictures of the home where four men were discovered in squalor after allegedly being kept as slaves.

Vasilica Panaghita, 54, was charged on Friday with slavery offences after West Midlands Police officers found the men in a lean-to building at the unemployed womanâ€™s bungalow in Birmingham.

The men - who were found by police last Monday - are believed to have been at the address in the Alum Rock district of the city for about a year, and are now being cared for by the Salvation Army.

Panaghita was charged with four counts of knowingly holding another person in slavery or solitude, and has been remanded in custody to next appear at Birmingham Crown Court on April 18.

A further eight people, four men and four women, were also arrested in connection with trafficking offences. They have been bailed pending further inquiries, police said.

A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'A woman has appeared at court in Birmingham charged with slavery offences after four men were found in squalid conditions at her address.

'Police visited the address on Monday as part of enquiries into the welfare of those at the address where they found four men in a lean-to building at the property.

Location: The alley leading to the home where the men were found in the Alum Rock district of Birmingham

'The men are believed to have been at the address for approximately a year. They are currently being cared for by the Salvation Army.'

Officers were aided in the probe by the National Crime Agency - launched in October to combat immigration and trafficking offenders, organised crime, economic crimes and child exploitation.

The area where the men were found is two miles from the city centre and played host to a visit in 2010 by Prime Minister David Cameron, who was shown the regeneration of a community centre.
