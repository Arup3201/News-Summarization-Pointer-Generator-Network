The brother of President John F Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, is suing the funeral home which sold the killer's coffin for £55,000.

Robert Oswald, 80, has accused Baumgardner Funeral Home in Fort Worth, Texas, of acting in bad taste for selling the coffin after his body was exhumed as part of a CIA conspiracy probe.

Two days after President Kennedy was gunned down as he rode in an open-topped motorcade, Oswald was shot dead by night club owner Jack Ruby as he walked through Dallas police station.

Oswald was buried at the Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Texas in 1963, but his body was exhumed 18 years later and examined after mounting speculation about CIA involvement.

Robert Oswald. 80, claims he is the rightful owner and said that something so 'disgusting' should not be sold. 

He said he paid a total of £451 to purchase a casket, vault, suit and flowers for the funeral and thought the coffin had been destroyed years ago.

Allen Baumgardner, a funeral director who was part of the exhumation, kept the coffin and after failing to sell it on numerous occasions, finally found a buyer in 2010.

'His motive is to keep items away from the public. He does not want it out,' Mr Oswald's lawyer, Gant Grimes, told The Independent.

President Kennedy was fatally shot by a sniper while traveling with his wife Jackie Kennedy in Dallas

'He appreciates there is some historical interest in things such as letters and such because [Oswald] played a significant role in US history. But this was the coffin. He bought it for his brother. He never thought he would see it again.'

When the original coffin was bought by Robert Oswald, it was a gift to his dead brother and formed part of his estate.

Mr Baumgardner argued that as neither Oswald's widow nor daughters had claimed the coffin, ownership was vested with the funeral home.

After his death, doubts that Oswald was the true assassin quickly surfaced and some historians came to believe that he was in fact a covert U.S. intelligence agent

After his death, doubts that Oswald was the true assassin quickly surfaced and some historians came to believe that he was in fact a covert U.S. intelligence agent.

The former Marine is said to have defected to the Soviet Union in 1960 promising to reveal valuable military secrets.

But he was allowed back into the country less than two years later with no consequences for his betrayal.

The government theory that Oswald acted alone was not enough to convince many Americans following the President's assassination, including the leader's own brother.

Robert Kennedy, who was the Attorney General at the time, immediately suspected that the CIA had something to do with the President's death in Dallas.

There have been a number of other conspiracy theories involving the USSR and the Mafia, who were said to be angry with JFK after the botched Bay of Pigs invasion. 

When Oswald was buried, the absence of mourners meant reporters covering the burial were asked by officials to act has pallbearers and carry the coffin.

But mounting speculation as to whether Oswald was inside the coffin or whether a Russian agent had been placed instead meant the pine box was exhumed and the remains checked.

An anonymous bidder bought the coffin for nearly £56,450  at Nate D Sanders Auctions of Santa Monica, California, exceeded the original closing deadline by two hours.

The coffin was not the only item up for auction, as several instruments used to embalm Oswald, his death certificate, an Easter card he sent to his brother were also up for sale

A section of the car seat on which President Kennedy was sitting when he was shot was also available at the auction.

A statement from the Nate D Sanders auction house said: 'The original deteriorated coffin offered here, measures 80in long by 24in deep, with the thickness of the sides of the casket approximately one inch. Sitting on wood crate which measures 84in by 24in.'

State District Judge Don Cosby of Fort Worth heard testimony and arguments in a two-day trial that ended earlier this week.

Lawyers say the judge is not expected to rule before Christmas.

Laura Yntema, a manager at Nate D. Sanders Auctions, said, 'It's in limbo until the case is resolved. So whatever the court tells us to do, we'll do regarding the casket. It's being kept in a secure facility, so it's safe.'
