The death of a woman working at an Amazon warehouse in Pennsylvania is being investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the agency said in a Friday press release, as it cited five companies for 'serious' violations after an investigation into a worker's death last year at a New Jersey facility.

Jody Rhoads, 52, died on June 1 from wounds she suffered when the pallet jack she 'was operating [...] crashed into shelving and pinned her,' the Associated Press reported.

Rhoads, a widow who earlier survived a battle with breast cancer, left behind two sons and four grandchildren, her obituary said.

The citations came after an investigation into the December 2013 death of temporary Amazon worker Ronald Smith at an Avenel, New Jersey facility, OSHA said in the release.

Smith 'was caught in between a conveyor system and crushed while performing sorting operations' and later died, the agency said.

The 57-year-old man left behind four children and seven grandchildren, NJ.com reported.

Four staffing agencies, along with logistics company Genco, were cited for 'serious' violations, which '[occur] when there is substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known,' OSHA said.

The staffing agencies were cited 'for failure to perform a hazard assessment of the facility before assigning employees to determine if hazards existed.'

Genco was cited 'for not certifying that a hazard assessment of the facility had been conducted before assigning employees to work.'

'Temporary staffing agencies and host employers are jointly responsible for the safety and health of temporary employees,' Patricia Jones, the director of the OSHA Avenel Area Office, said in the release. 'These employers must assess the work site to ensure that workers are adequately protected from potential hazards. It is essential that employers protect all workers from job hazards - both temporary and permanent workers.'

All five companies face a $6,000 fine. Amazon has so far not been cited by OSHA.
