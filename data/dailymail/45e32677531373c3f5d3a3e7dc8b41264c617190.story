Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn was able to leave Melbourne with a smile, happy to see the end of what she described as one of the worst weeks of her career.

The first five and a half days from last Monday were overshadowed by a legal battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria with former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde and his claim on a full-time race-seat for this season.

That was eventually resolved on Saturday morning ahead of qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix, although further talks are planned this week - in a private arena away from the courtroom - between both sides in a bid to finally close the matter.

Once Sauber and Kaltenborn were again able to concentrate on the racing, drivers Marcus Ericsson and rookie Felipe Nasr acquitted themselves well.

Nasr was a superb fifth - the highest position by a Brazilian driver on debut - while Ericsson's eighth-place finish was the best result by a Swede since Stefan Johansson in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix.

When you consider Sauber endured the worst season in their history last year when they failed to score a point , their feats around Melbourne's Albert Park were all the more remarkable.

'It was a very nice ending to the weekend,' Kaltenborn said.

'The events of last week were not easy for the entire team. You can try to keep things away from them, but they are exposed to it. You just don't know how to shield it from them.

'But it was impressive how the team continued to do their work, to remain focused and to bring home the kind of result we saw.

'For me personally, last week was probably one of my toughest in my time at Sauber, and I don't want to experience it again.

'I'm very glad it's over - all the more glad with the outcome (of the race) - and we focus now on the future.'

Kaltenborn conceded on Friday the events of last week had resulted in 'a negative impact' on the team, but she felt confident that, given the tremendous result, it had now been restored.

'With what happened, the morale was affected, but you could feel they got themselves together,' Kaltenborn added.

'With these kind of results, you can have an extra push of motivation and you can feel good about it.

'This result tells people we're back, to forget about what happened last year, that it was a one-off and won't happen again.'
