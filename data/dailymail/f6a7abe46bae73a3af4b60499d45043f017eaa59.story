Canada's national airline was today ordered to apologise to a couple of French language 'extremists' who complained that cabin crew only spoke to them in English. 

Michel and Lynda Thibodeau launched legal action against Air Canada for not respecting their right to be served food and drink in their mother tongue. 

Mr Thibodeau - also a fluent English speaker - branded the airline's employees as 'malicious, oppressive and reprehensible' for not answering his questions in French.

The couple claimed they didn't get served in French when they checked in for their flight or at the boarding gate at the airport in the Canadian capital Ottawa. 

They also complained that they ordered a 7UP drink aboard the plane, but the English speaking air hostess brought them a Sprite instead aboard the flight in July 2009. They were initially awarded £8,000 in damages in 2010, but Air Canada appealed and the ruling was overturned. 

The Thibodeaus then took their case to the Canadian Supreme Court, where judges ruled on Tuesday that Canada's Official Languages Act does not allow citizens to sue for cash damages for being spoken to in the wrong language. 

Instead, the airline was only ordered to apologise to the couple and ensure the Languages Act was respected in future. Mr Thibodeau had also filed a similar language complaint against Ottawa's bus company in 2002 after a driver greeted him with 'hello' instead of 'bonjour'.

The Thibodeaus made their complaint after not being served in their mother tongue, French

Canada's National Post newspaper had earlier described Mr Thibodeau as the linguistic equivalent of a 'supermarket coupon clipper'. 

Columnist Barbara Kay wrote: 'Instead of haunting supermarkets, he haunts bus companies and airlines, forever on the lookout for a breach of his right to hear the station stop, the weather, the time and the altitude in French. 

'Next time Mr Thibodeau tries his little trick, the airlines should offer him a free case 7UP, and if that isn't good enough then they should inform him - in both official languages - that he is wasting their time.'
