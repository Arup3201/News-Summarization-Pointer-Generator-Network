Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho could be back in Manchester City’s line-up at Burnley, with the club playing down reports they were dropped after a dressing-room spat.

The pair became embroiled in a heated argument at half-time during the champions’ 2-1 defeat at Liverpool earlier this month.

Both were omitted from the starting XI for the following match against Leicester. But City say the row had nothing to do with Manuel Pellegrini’s selection and the warring duo could be back in the line-up for Saturday’s match at Turf Moor.

Tempers flared at Anfield when City returned to the dressing room with the score 1-1.

In the build-up to Liverpool’s opener, midfielder Fernandinho sold defender Kompany  short with a poor pass before Jordan Henderson scored.

‘Fernandinho had a go at Vinnie and he went right back at him,’ a City insider told Sportsmail. ‘He was raging. Others had to get involved to stop it.’

According to reports, Pellegrini sided with the Brazilian, which prompted more fury from Kompany before team-mates stepped in. 

City declined to comment on the incident, but strongly deny it influenced Pellegrini’s decision to rest Fernandinho and bench Kompany for the 2-0 win over Leicester.

Kompany, who signed a new five-year contract last summer following a 2008 move from Hamburg, was an unused substitute for the following match, a 2-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Leicester City, with Pellegrini claiming he needed to freshen his side up.

Brazilian Fernandinho, a £34m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was left out of the squad altogether.

Manchester City declined to comment on the incident. However, they are understood to be happy that there is no lingering animosity, believe the row was over as quickly as it started and are of the opinion that it was similar to disagreements that happen on a regular basis in dressing rooms across the country.

They are also keen to point out that it had nothing to do with Kompany not playing the next game. 

The Premier League champions are currently five points behind leaders Chelsea, who have a game in hand.
