Reece Messer pictured at 14: His family say he needs help

Police admitted last night that they are being dragged into too many Twitter disputes as a row raged over the decision to arrest a youth who abused Olympic diving star Tom Daley.

Officers swooped on the home of Reece Messer, 17, at 2.45am yesterday, hours after he told the sports star he had ‘let down’  his late father in Monday’s synchronised ten metre final.

Messer also threatened to ‘drown’ the 18-year-old but backtracked and apologised when his messages provoked an online storm.

Last night, as Dorset police handed the troubled teenager a formal harassment warning, police leaders claimed forces are being dragged into too many petty social media rows.

Officers were asked to look at content 14,000 times on Facebook alone last year and Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers,  said forces do not have the resources to monitor the internet.

He said: ‘There is legislation which concerns causing harassment, alarm or distress. But can we police the internet when someone upsets someone else?

‘I don’t think we have the resources to do that. We can’t have a free-for-all online but we cannot involve the police every time something unpleasant is said.’

But Stuart Hyde, chief constable of Cumbria and the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on social media, said: ‘Social media is increasingly part of police business and the law covers situations where you have comment that goes way beyond legitimate opinion.

'We don’t just deal with people who are famous. People have the right to freedom of speech but it has to be within the law.’

The episode is an embarrassment for Games bosses who dubbed the extravaganza the ‘social media Olympics’.

Daley did not make a formal complaint  about the series of tweets. Reece Messer was arrested after a complaint from a member of the public.

He was on police bail last night, but he could still face up to six months in prison for offences under the Malicious Communications Act after officers said they were investigating the rest of his Twitter account.

A harassment warning can  be issued under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is not a criminal conviction but will appear on an enhanced criminal records check.

Reece’s family protested that he is a drop-out who has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and ‘needs help  not punishment’.

His father Norman Messer, 58, apologised to Daley. He said his son has a psychiatric problem and ‘badly needs help’ but has no incentive to sort out his life because of his lavish benefits.

At his home in Boscombe, near Bournemouth, the carpet cleaner said: ‘I’m quite shocked. Reece badly needs help. I’m heartbroken this has happened to him.

‘I think the police should be involved, but he doesn’t know what he’s saying. He just doesn’t think about it.

‘We’ve had a long history with Reece. It all started when he was about eight years old, he was quite normal up to that point.

‘Then he started going to school, insulting the other children, saying things like “Your mum’s a prostitute” to the other little boys. After that there were other problems in school.

‘He’s just gone off the rails. He suffers from ADHD. But he won’t take his medication.

‘I just want to say sorry to Tom Daley and wish him every success in the future.’

Mr Messer explained that he and Reece’s mother split up when Reece was 12 months old, and she now lives in Stockport. The controversy began after Daley and partner Pete Waterfield, 31, came fourth in the synchronised ten metre platform dive.

In a Twitter message, Reece  told the young diver whose father died of a brain tumour last year: ‘You let your dad down i hope you know that.’

Daley forwarded the abuse  from ‘Rileyy_69’ and commented to his 850,000 followers: ‘After  giving it my all . . . you get idiots sending me this.’

Thousands of Twitter users rushed to support Daley and identified the abuser.

This provoked a series of messages in which Reece apologised to the sports star but then threatened to ‘drown you’ and called him a ‘cocky t**t’.

One message said: ‘@TomDaley1994 I’m sorry mate i just wanted you to win cause its the olympics I’m just annoyed we didn’t win I’m sorry tom accept my apology.’

He added: ‘please i don’t want to be hated I’m just sorry you didn’t win i was rooting for you pal to do britain all proud just so upset.’

It is understood that the threat of violence led police to arrest Reece at a bedsit in Weymouth.

Meanwhile, a Welsh Premier League footballer has been suspended after an abusive message was sent to Daley.

Port Talbot Town FC has confirmed its midfielder Daniel Thomas will be the subject of an internal investigation into a tweet sent to Team GB diver Daley.

According to reports, a homophobic message was sent to Daley's Twitter page from the 10DanThomas10 account, which has since been deleted.

Port Talbot FC officials stressed their player had been the victim of a 'misguided prank' after leaving his phone unattended - but confirmed 28-year-old Thomas had been suspended while they looked into the matter.

A club spokesman said: 'Port Talbot Town Football Club can confirm Daniel Thomas has been suspended from all involvement with the club until we have carried out a full internal investigation.

'We were made aware to an offensive comment appearing on the Twitter feed of one of our players.

'Upon being informed of the matter, we immediately distanced ourselves from any offensive messages whilst investigating the matter further.

'Having spoken at length to the player in question, we believe he regrettably left his phone unattended and was the victim of a very misguided "prank".'

The club said it and Thomas apologised 'unreservedly' and in no way condoned the views made in the tweet.

The spokesman added: 'All footballers at Port Talbot Town will also be briefed on the appropriate use of social media and ensuring it is used securely and responsibly.'

Daley’s close friend and Team GB diving team-mate Tonia Couch, whom Daley watched compete yesterday, suggested the exchange of comments would swiftly be forgotten.

She said: ‘Tom’s a strong boy. He can concentrate on what he needs to do and, at the end of the day, Twitter’s Twitter. You don’t need to look at it if you don’t want to.’

Asked what she made of the abuse, she added: ‘Not much really, neither has Tom. We’re just concentrating on the Olympics.’

Team GB gymnast Louis Smith said ignoring Twitter is probably the best policy for athletes trying to win an Olympic medal.

He said: ‘There are just tweets that you do not want to see.  Some people are not bothered by negative tweets and they can go about their day, but if you are going to take it personally then do not do it.’
