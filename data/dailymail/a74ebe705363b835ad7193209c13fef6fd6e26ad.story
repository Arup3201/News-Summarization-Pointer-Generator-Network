A pensioner spoke today of how he thought his family were going to die after their car plunged into a canal and began to sink.

Bob Seddon, 68, his wife Patricia, son Nic and grandson Daniel, 16, were trapped in the car under water after it hit a brick and careered from the road into the Bridgewater Canal, Greater Manchester.

As the BMW hire car quickly filled with water, Nic, who had been at the wheel, smashed his window and escaped.

The 45-year-old father-of-three then faced a race against time to rescue his parents and nephew Daniel.

He climbed on the car’s roof and kicked in the glass with his bare feet before trying to pull the 6ft 3in teenager from the car.

Bob, who was sitting in the back with Patricia, 65, unhooked the teenager’s seatbelt and pushed him forward.

Nic then swam to the far bank with Daniel, who cannot swim, and was helped by two schoolboys to get him onto the bank.

Without a thought for his own safety, Nic then swam back to the car in a bid to rescue his mum and dad, who were still in the back seat of the vehicle as it started to sink to the bottom.

He managed to get his dad out even though he suffers from severe arthritis.

Fire crews quickly arrived on the scene and jumped into the water.

They pulled Nic and Bob to safety and used an axe to smash the car’s rear window.

But they were unable to get Patricia past the rear seat headrests and had to smash a side window to pull her free as the car went underwater.

She was taken unconscious to the side of the canal, where paramedics and firefighters worked to resuscitate her. She began to breathe again and was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital, where she is still recovering.

The crash happened in darkness at Canal Road, Timperley, at about 8pm on Tuesday.

Bob, from Sale, a retired airport worker, who has been married to Patricia for 46 years, said: 'I thought we were going to die. I think the car hit a brick.

'It just lurched sideways and the next thing it was in the canal. I didn’t want to leave my wife. I felt terrible. The car was filling with water very quickly. I had to get out, but I knew she was in there. Thankfully the firefighters managed to get her out.

'Nic was absolutely exhausted. I don’t know how he did it. At one point, I had to hold him up because I was worried that he was going to go under the water. The fire crews were amazing. I can’t thank them enough.'

Nic, who is married and lives in Sunderland, had travelled to Sale to visit his parents when the crash happened.

He said: 'I’m still in shock. I’m just glad we all survived. I did what I could. I got Daniel out and then my dad, but I couldn’t get my mum out.

'There was no way I was leaving her. I kept close to the car while the firemen came to get her out. It’s your family at the end of the day. It’s everything. I thought "it’s not going to end like this".

The nurse at the hospital said I was a hero, but the firemen were the real heroes. They saved mum’s life. She was gone and they brought her back.'

Patricia Seddon needed to have her heart restarted after the accident before being rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital

Fire crews from Sale and Altrincham 
stations were called to the canal bank and decided they had no option 
but to go into the water.

Firefighter Mark Pendlebury, 29, from Didsbury, helped Nic to the canal bank then used an axe to smash the car’s rear window.

He
suffered a severe cut to his left hand and later had to have four 
stitches as he tried to free Patricia as the car went underwater.

Firefighter Colin Latham, 31, smashed a side window on the car and pulled Mrs Seddon back to the surface with the help of firefighter Mike Wilson, 31.

All three then took her to the bank, where she was given CPR by firefighter Gary Lovatt, 39.

Mr Pendlebury said: 'There was a man in the water saying his mum was still inside the car.

'I helped the gentleman to get out of the water as he was shaking with cold and struggling to stay afloat. As I went back over to the car it was starting to submerge quicker and quicker.

'I turned back to the bank to get an axe to break a window. As the car tilted up, I smashed the rear windscreen and tried to pull the woman out of the back.

'At that point, the car completely submerged. We weren’t able to pull her over the back headrests so Colin smashed the side window and we got her out and took her to the bank.'

Mr Wilson, also from Sale, said: 'It was a great relief when we got her out. Thankfully she’s okay.'

Two schoolboys have also been praised for their part in the dramatic rescue.

Ryan Cummins and Stephen Hoyland, both 15, were walking home along the canal towpath when they heard screams and saw the black BMW’s brake lights shining out from the water.

The 15-year-olds ran to help and were first on the scene.

They helped drag 16-year-old Daniel out of the water onto the canal bank.

Stephen, of Timperley, said: 'We just saw a man treading water with a younger boy. We ran down to the edge and grabbed one of his arms each and pulled him up to the side.

'The man he was with swam back to the car. We were then just watching by the side as there was nothing that we could do. We were shouting for help and someone came out of a nearby garden and raised the alarm. The lad was coughing up water and he couldn’t speak.

'We just did what we felt we had to do. Anyone would.'

Ryan, also from Timperley, added: 'We didn’t think, we just reacted. The woman wasn’t moving or breathing when she was rescued. They were pumping her chest and it was going on for a good five minutes until she started to breathe again.'

Ryan’s mum Jayne Cummins, 38, said both boys were heroes. She added: 'I am very proud of them and it is nice to see a positive story involving teenagers.'
