David Cameron today insisted the world will not 'fall in' if a Tory government takes spending back to the levels seen in 2002.

The Prime Minister unveiled the Conservative election priorities, including the deficit, jobs and housing but not the NHS or immigration, which are high up the list of voters' concerns.

But he argued that getting a grip on the nation's finances was vital to ensure that 'not a penny will be cut from the NHS budget'.

Prime Minister David Cameron unveiled the Conservative election priorities, including the deficit, jobs and housing but not the NHS or immigration, which are high up the list of voters' concerns

The Tory leader urged voters not to pass on a crippling 'legacy of debt' to their children and grandchildren.

In a speech in Nottingham today, Mr Cameron sought to cast the general election in May as a choice between security and chaos.

He urged voters not to pass on a crippling 'legacy of debt' to their children and grandchildren.

And he brushed off dire warnings from Labour about the impact of spending cuts, insisting it only meant a reduction of £1 for every £100 – something every family or business could cope with.

The six election themes which the Tories will focus on are the deficit, jobs, taxes, education, home ownership and retirement.

Mr Cameron said: 'We don't just want to eliminate the current budget deficit, we want to clear the entire budget deficit and start running a surplus.'

Britain would be 'back in the black' by 2018, using extra money raised from tax to start paying down the nation's debts, he said.

'And at the end of all this, I want people to be clear: Day-to-day spending on public services will be the same in real terms as it was in 2002.

'The world didn't fall in then; it won't this time. And finally, as a country, we will be genuinely paying down our debt rather than increasing it.

'We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.'

The Tories, in coalition with the Lib Dems, had promised to have eradicated the deficit by now.

Latest polling shows that voters name the economy, health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family, with immigration a key concern for the country

The absence of immigration and the NHS from the key Tory themes set out by David Cameron was seized on by rivals.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said that for Mr Cameron the NHS was the subject that 'dare not speak its name'. 

MEP Steven Woolfe, Ukip's migration spokesman, said: 'Despite all his rhetoric last year, David Cameron's omission of immigration as a major topic during this year's election is yet another example of the Prime Minister running away from debating the big issues.'

But the Prime Minister said: 'These areas I am talking about are very directly related to people's concerns about their lives and their security.

'It's about people's jobs, people's taxes, the homes they want to buy, the schools they want to send their children to, and their retirement.

'Through this prism we will address every single issue.'

The Prime Minister said he had already set out 'the most radical set of actions that any government has ever contemplated in this country' to tackle European immigration through curbs on access to benefits.

Mr Cameron also insisted that the NHS was 'at the heart of this commitment for Britain to live within her means'.

He added: 'People can see a real track record, a real commitment and it's at the heart of what we are saying.' 

Instead it has fallen by around 40 per cent in cash terms since the last election, and is now 5 per cent of GDP, half what it was in 2010.

To eradicate the deficit, so the government raises more in tax than it spends, will require another £30billion of savings, Mr Cameron said.

'That is a lot, but it's doable. It requires us to continue the same rate of saving for the first two years of the next Parliament, as we have done for the past five years.

'It means reducing overall government spending by just one per cent each year.

'Put another way, we have to save £1 a year in every £100 that Government spends.

'I don't think there's a family or business that couldn't do that – and I don't think Government, seeing as it's your money, should be any different.'

The Tory leader sought to personalise the election by asking parents and grandparents to consider whether, as a nation, they want to 'pass on a mountain of debt to the next generations that they could never hope to re-pay'.

'To every mother, father, grandparent, uncle, aunt, I would ask this question,' Mr Cameron said.

'When you look at the children you love, do you want to land them with a legacy of huge debts? Do you want to limit their future, to make life more difficult for their generation, because we refuse to do the right thing in our generation?

'I say we have a responsibility to act. We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.'

The speech comes a day before a Commons vote which Tories hope to use to highlight differences with Labour over economic strategy in the years after 2015-16. 

Chancellor George Osborne has accused Labour of setting the scene for tax rises equivalent to 3p on income tax by refusing to match his pledge to balance the books by spending cuts alone.

But Ed Miliband accused him of 'plucking figures out of the air' and said Labour would eliminate the deficit by 'common sense' spending cuts, tax rises targeted on the rich and a wage boost for the lowest-paid workers which he said would increase tax revenues and cut the bill for in-work benefits.

MPs will be asked tomorrow to approve a new Charter for Budget Responsibility committing the Government to a goal of eradicating the structural current deficit on a rolling three-year horizon - which at the time of the next Budget will be 2017-18 - and ensure that debt is falling as a percentage of GDP by 2016-17. 

Labour has said it will back the plan, which it believes is compatible with its plans to eradicate the current deficit 'as soon as possible' in the next Parliament.

Cameron says: We don't just want to eliminate the current budget deficit we want to clear the entire budget deficit and start running a surplus.

Reality: At the 2010 election the Tories promised to 'eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a Parliament'. Instead it has fallen by around 40 per cent in cash terms since the last election, and is now 5 per cent of GDP, half what it was in 2010. The deficit will still be £91billion this year, requiring £30billion in spending cuts.

Cameron says: 'Conservatives know the best way to help people out of poverty is not to hand them a benefit cheque; it's to help them get into work.'

Reality: Employment has been one of the big success stories of the coalition, with a record 30.8million in work, 73 per cent of the working age population.

Cameron says: 'This is about your family's money – about whether you get to keep more of your money each month with the Conservatives, or pay higher taxes with Labour.'

Reality: The Tories have promised that no-one earning the minimum wage - equivalent to £12,500-a-year - will pay any income tax at all, while point at which the 40p tax rate is levied will rise from around £42,000 to £50,000. The £7billion bill is likely to be met from the planned surplus.

Cameron says: 'For parents, the security of knowing your children are getting a decent education.'

Reality: Latest OECD figures show the UK languishing in mid-table in global education rankings, with maths and reading rated better in China, Korea, Japan, Poland, Slovenia and Germany. Improving education standards and preparing young Britons for work will be vital to competing in the much-mocked 'global race' and to increasing competition for jobs currently taken by migrants.

Cameron says: 'The security of having a home of your own – denied to too many for too long.'

Reality: The Tories have long prided themselves on being the party of home ownership, but the facts speak for themselves. Latest figures show that just 65.2 per cent of people owned their home in 2012-13, the lowest level since the early 1980s.

Cameron says: 'Real dignity and security for those in retirement. These are the things that are on the ballot paper in May.'

Reality: The coalition introduced the 'triple lock' on the state pension, which means it rises by inflation, wages or 2.5 per cent whichever is higher. The Tories are committed to continuing it. But it comes at a cost, with the bill for pensions making up the bulk of the welfare state, rising from £87billion in 2010-+11 to £104billion last year.
