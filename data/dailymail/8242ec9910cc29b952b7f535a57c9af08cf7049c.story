The Danish Royals enjoyed a fun-filled family outing at the weekend, as they took a visit to Legoland in Billund, Denmark.

Australian-born Crown Princess of Denmark Mary and her husband Crown Prince Frederik spent the day strolling in the sunshine on what looked to be a stunning summers day.

Their children Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine were all in tow, clearly ecstatic to be visiting the amusement park.

Princess Mary looked elegant in a cap-sleeved black lace dress which fell to just above the knee. The frock featured an empire waistline with the skirt falling loosely below that.

Her hair was pulled back in to a low bun and she wore large dark sunglasses and strappy tan sandals.

The Crown Princess, who hails from Tasmania, smiled as she held onto her daughter Princess Josephine's hand, who looked inquisitive as she eagerly took in her surroundings.

Later in the day Princess Mary took a ride on a brightly coloured lego train with her twins, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, both three.

She sat with the pair in the blue and yellow coloured carriage as her youngest daughter pointed to something she had spotted in the distance.

Crown Prince Frederik looked relaxed in a blue and white checked shirt and beige shorts as he walked alongside his children in the amusement park.

The couple's eldest son, Prince Christian, 8, strolled just in front of his father holding a novelty-sized minion, a character from the Despicable Me franchise.

Prince Vincent was later seen clutching his big brother's toy, and the yellow creature was nearly as big as him.

Other members of the Danish Royal family also attended the outing, such as Princess Alexandra of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg.
