A 17-year-old Texas boy is in a coma after being tasered last week by a Texas police officer in a school hallway after he ‘tried to break up a fight between two girls’.

Noe Nino de Rivera had stepped in to break up a fight between the girls at Cedar Creek High School on November 20, according to his mother, Maria Acosta.

Bastrop County Deputy, Randy McMillan, arrived at the scene and tasered de Rivera, who fell on his face and was knocked unconscious.

Coma: The boy is now in a coma with 'permanent brain damage' after the police officer tasered him and he fell on his face

Sued: Bastrop County Deputy, Randy McMillan, reportedly handcuffed the boy while he was on the floor unconscious after he hit his head and had a brain hemorrhage

McMillan reportedly then handcuffed the unconscious boy, who had only been trying to ‘diffuse the situation’, according to Courthouse News Service.

de Rivera's devastated mother is now suing Bastrop County, its school district and McMillan, who works as the school resource officer.

She claims in the suit that school officials ‘delayed in calling for medical assistance even though N.N. was in an obvious emergency medical situations’.

The teenager was airlifted to St. David's Medical Center, where he immediately underwent surgery to repair a severe brain hemorrhage and was placed in a medically-induced coma.

de Rivera remains in a coma, and has not been able to communicate with his family since his hospitalization, according to the lawsuit.

The mother claims McMillan never was in 
danger, and that the defendants let him work at the school even after he
 shot a student with a taser a year ago.

That created a ‘foreseeable danger’ that led to her son's injuries, she claims.

Overreaction: Students who saw the incident say McMillan overreacted and did not need to taser the teenager, who is now in a coma

She seeks medical expenses and damages for excessive force, failure to train and discipline and civil rights and education code violations.

Students who saw the incident say McMillan overreacted.

‘There was a crowd watching and the kid was just trying to get the officers to listen to him,’ said one student to KXAN. ‘When he shot the taser, there was a crowd, and others could have been hit.’

The incident is under investigation and McMillan has been placed on patrol until the investigation is complete.

According to the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office, McMillan has never received complaints for using excessive force, and he's never been disciplined for using excessive force.

Sissy Jones of the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office, there is a video of the incident showing de Rivera 'being aggressive'

But the sheriff says he wants to make sure proper protocol was used in this case, so he's waiting to see the final report.

According to Sissy Jones of the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office, there is a video of the incident showing de Rivera 'being aggressive'.

'He is not complying with any of the verbal orders,' she told Fox News.

Jones said, 'One of the officers puts his hand on de Rivera's chest and says, you need to back up and that's when de Rivera hits the officer's hand.'

Acosta said de Rivera was just talking about joining the Marines. Now she says she just hopes he wakes up. The teen may still face charges once the investigation is complete, according to KXAN.
