A survivalist suspected of burglarizing Utah cabins and evading law enforcement for years was finally arrested today, authorities said.

Troy James Knapp was taken into custody in mountains outside of Ferron in central Utah, the Sanpete County Sheriff's Office said.

The 45-year-old has long been suspected of being an armed and dangerous recluse who has spent more than five years breaking into dozens of mountain cabins across remote southern Utah.

Trapped: 'Mountain Man' Troy James Knapp is taken into custody by the Emery County Sheriff's Office on April 2 outside of Ferron in central Utah

Tracked down: The elusive survivalist was captured by police on Tuesday after spending five years allegedly robbing cabins in the wilderness and leaving taunts for officers

Police say he's been living off the 
comfort of cabins in winter and retreating to makeshift summer camps 
deep in the forest with stolen guns and supplies.

The last known time Knapp was spotted was on October 1 last year by a surveillance camera in Sanpete County.

He had a gun slung over his shoulder and was using binoculars to scope 
for an alarm system at a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir before breaking in.

Iron, Kane and Garfield counties have all issued arrest warrants for Knapp on burglary and weapons charges.

While there have been no violent confrontations with Knapp, authorities had feared he was a ticking time bomb.

In 5th District Court in Iron County, Knapp is facing four counts of burglary, a second-degree felony; theft, a second-degree felony; and three counts of theft, a class B misdemeanor - all charges for incidents spanning June 2009 through September of 2011.

He is suspected of leaving some 
cabins riddled with bullet holes, defacing religious icons and writing 
taunting notes for cabin owners and authorities.

'Hey Sheriff...Gonna put you in the ground!' one note said, according to court records.

Records
 indicate Knapp fell off the radar in 2002 when he apparently left 
California in violation of his parole for a burglary conviction.

He was charged with theft in 2000 in California, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison, according to records.

Mountain mystery: A man believed to be serial burglar and expert survivalist Troy James Knapp was caught on CCTV last year in Sanpete County, Utah

Roaming: The 'mountain man' was spotted on CCTV in Sanpete County, Utah last week but once again police have failed to track down the expert survivalist

As
 a teenager, Knapp was convicted in Michigan of breaking and entering, 
passing bad checks and unlawful flight from authorities, according to 
court records in Kalamazoo County.

His
 most serious arrest for felony assault in Michigan was reduced in 1994 
to a charge of malicious destruction of property after he agreed to 
plead guilty.

He has been compared to Davy 
Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean known as 'King of 
the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of 
wilderness.

Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented.

One hunter, who is believed to have bumped into Knapp in June, asked him his name and was simply told: 'The Mountain'.

Long search: Troy James Knapp, 44, pictured in December 2011. It is believed that he is responsible for a series of burglaries at holiday homes in the Utah wilderness

Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor

‘This guy is probably about as true a 
survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said at the time.

Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name

Anyone with information has been asked to contact authorities.

In December 2011, photos were taken of a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder, believed to be Knapp.

It is thought that the expert woodsman has spent around seven years breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food, 
alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies.

In
 February, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin 
after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. 

It
 turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin 
was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January 2012 with the 
fingerprint match.

Early on, investigators thought his 
unattended camps they came across during their search were left 
behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse.

This
 was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns, 
radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a 
name, but the man remains in the mist.
