Arsenal's fatigued talisman Alexis Sanchez failed to prevent Chile falling to a shock defeat by Iran in St Polten.

Former Real Madrid boss and Manchester United assistant coach Carlos Queiroz masterminded a resolute Iran side to prevail 2-0 at the neutral venue of the NV Arena in Austria.

In their first ever meeting, goals from Javad Nekounam and Vahid Amiri finished off Chile in the international friendly for a remarkable result.

Alexis Sanchez, who has already played 3,326 minutes  for the Gunners this season, started on the Chile bench alongside Juventus star Arturo Vidal with Sunday's clash against South American counterparts Brazil in mind.

A stuttering Chile failed to utilise their dominance in the opening exchanges and were undone by a simple set piece.

Iran captain Nekounam couldn't believe his luck as he strode in unmarked at the back post following an Iran corner on 21 minutes, with Barcelona keeper Claudio Bravo failing to react in time.

Chile had 74 per cent of possession in Austria but we toothless in attack, hence the introduction of Sanchez at the interval.

However a swift counter attack on 50 minutes saw Vahid Amiri double Iran's lead as he swept in from 12 yards.

Jorge Sampaoli's side poured forward, determined to level the contest. Mark Gonzalez missed Chile's best chance before halftime when he had his header saved by Iran goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi in the 43rd.

Chile created more danger after Sanchez's appearance. On the hour mark, he set up Jose Pedro Fuenzalida but his diagonal shot went wide.

Sanchez came close in the 77th when he controlled the ball on the chest before sending his volley from 15 meters just over the bar.

However Iran stood firm and recorded a famous win, whereas Chile will have to improve drastically ahead of facing Brazil in London at the weekend and then hosting the Copa America in June.
