Schoolies season has kicked off in style on the Gold Coast after thousands of teens descended on the party capital of Australia for the week-long celebrations.  

The kids had been on the war-path from earlier in the day, as booze was stacked up in hotel rooms and balconies were awash with fuelled-up teens ready for the hard-partying night ahead. 

As the night progressed and the partying continued, police patrolled the area, taking the toolies away and imposing fines on troublemakers.

'We’re just here to get drunk and have a bit of fun with our mates,' Harrison Mallan said.

He said that he had approximately $250 worth of drink bought for him. 

The young teens are seen as a hot market for money thirsty drug dealers and police believe substandard drugs may be peddled due to a string of recent crack downs on the narcotics.  

Speaking to the Gold Coast Bulletin, Major and Organised Crime Squad boss Detective Inspector Scott Knowles said suppliers will be looking to fill the demand and the quality of drugs would no doubt be inferior.

'They don't have quality control. Their only interest is to make money and walk away, so it's the youth who wear the consequences.' he said.  

No arrests or injuries were reported overnight on Friday but authorities are bracing themselves for an eventful Saturday night. 

'Tonight is traditionally a tough night because the kids are just so excited and pumped up and full of adrenalin,' Mark Reaburn told AAP.

Authorities have said that Surfers Paradise remains a popular spot for school leavers to party, although some are choosing to head overseas to Bali and Fiji. 

Acting Chief Superintendent Des Lacy says the main concern was people jumping from balcony to balcony on high-rise buildings.

'We've already seen catastrophes occur when that happens,' he told media this week.

'What we ask of young people ... (is) if you see that sort of behaviour please let us know.'

A 17-year-old schoolgirl from Brisbane fell to her death from a Surfers Paradise balcony two years ago.

Supt Lacy says his main message to those attending celebrations is to look out for one another.

Last year Queensland Ambulance Service staff treated about 500 schoolies within designated party precincts on the Gold Coast

Last year Queensland Ambulance Service staff treated about 500 schoolies within designated party precincts on the Gold Coast.

Most were treated for minor injuries, such as cuts, but many were treated for alcohol intoxication and a small number were treated for illicit drug use.

Assistant Commissioner Dee Taylor-Dutton reminded those attending to keep hydrated, with temperatures expected to reach the high 20s.

Gold Coast schoolies advisory board chairman Mark Reaburn said up to 20,000 school-leavers will go through the gates of a designated entertainment hub at Surfers Paradise from 7pm

Police have already arrested nine people at schoolies festivities in South Australia.

One person was also taken to hospital after allegedly taking ecstasy, police say.

And two teens were arrested for allegedly possessing the drug for sale at the Victor Harbor Schoolies Festival on Friday night.

Queues  started to form early for the designated entertainment hub at Surfers Paradise

Seven other people, including one non-schoolie, were arrested for behavioural offences.

'While the majority of school leavers are well behaved and are enjoying the festival, I want to warn the public to be aware if you decide to take illicit drugs, you are putting your life at risk,' Hills Fleurieu police superintendent Rob Williams said. 

The news comes just weeks after the funeral of Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter, who died of a suspected drug overdose after taking 'one and a half' pills at Harbourlife music festival earlier this month.

Her family believe it was due to an acute allergic reaction from the drugs.

It's believed she overdosed on the drug known as purple speaker. 

The tablets had a logo in the shape of a loudspeaker and resemble other Ecstasy tablets manufactured in the Netherlands and on the market two years ago.

 Major Events Group Sen-Sgt Ben Nielsen issued a blunt warning about the party drugs after the death of 19-year-old Georgina Bartter, who attended music festival Harbourlife in Sydney over the weekend.

'It's not the time to experiment and the tragedy that happened in Sydney on the weekend highlights that,' Sen-Sgt Nielsen told the Herald Sun.

'You just do not know what this stuff is made up with – there is no purity to it, there is no consistency to it.'

Police say a type of Ecstasy or MDMA tablet known as a 'purple speaker' may have been responsible for Georgina Bartter's death
