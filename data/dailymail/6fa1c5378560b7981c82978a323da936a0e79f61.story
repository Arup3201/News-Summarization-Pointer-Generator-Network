Paul Scholes believes England's best chance of beating Uruguay is to isolate Diego Lugano by playing Wayne Rooney as a central striker.

The Manchester United forward was put out to pasture on the left-hand side during the 2-1 defeat against Italy on Saturday.

And Rooney, despite assisting Daniel Sturridge's first half equaliser, was heavily criticised back home for not helping Leighton Baines enough.

Neat finish: Daniel Sturridge netted England's equaliser against Italy in Manaus on Saturday night

Scholes, writing in his Paddy Power blog, stresses that Roy Hodgson should take that problem out of the equation by starting the 28-year-old up front.

'Wayne Rooney can destroy Lugano, if Wayne is played in his best position,' he said. 'But I’ll say it again, Wayne has to play
 up front.

'Rio Ferdinand and Alan Shearer have repeated it on the BBC. 
Play our best goalscorer in his best position and he’ll get goals.

'His 
record at international level supports that. It’s not rocket science.'

Rooney's record at major tournaments isn't befitting a player who has been a lynchpin domestically for so many years; it's something he is clearly mindful of himself.

Bit of a problem? Rooney was forced to play out wide on the left against the Italians

Get him isolated: Scholes believes Rooney will 'destroy' Diego Lugano if he plays up front

He has been undergoing double sessions in a bid to fine tune match sharpness, and said this week: 'I said from the start I want to do everything I can to make sure I'm ready for these World Cup games and as part of that I was doing extra training a week before the squad joined up.'

That doesn't shock Scholes in the slightest.

'I’ve read that Rooney stayed for extra shooting practice after training with England on Monday. It doesn’t surprise me,' he added.

'That’s standard Wayne – he’d be out all day and you’d have to drag him in.'
