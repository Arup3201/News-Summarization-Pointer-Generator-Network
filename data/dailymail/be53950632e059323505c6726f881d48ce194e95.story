Under-fire private security firm G4S was at the centre of another embarrassing Olympics scandal today after an employee allegedlycalled a soldier a 'baby killer' as they worked at a Games venue.

The Asian civilian guard, who faces the sack, is said to have spat at the serviceman and made the abusive remark at the archery contest at Lord's Cricket Ground.

The remark is believed to have been a reference to the soldier's service in Afghanistan.

G4S, which had to be bailed out by troops after failing to provide enough guards to protect London 2012 venues, has begun an urgent investigation into the claims.

It said the soldier, understood to be a member of 35 Engineers, had asked to search the security officer.

The incident happened behind the scenes on Saturday evening as spectators watched Italy win the gold medal match against the U.S. in the men's team archery event.

A spokesman for G4S said: 'We are urgently investigating claims of an altercation between a security officer and a soldier.

'We take any case of improper behaviour by a member of our staff very seriously.

'We do not tolerate insulting behaviour and, where necessary, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.'

The Ministry of Defence described the alleged incident as an 'isolated occurrence'.

A MoD spokesman said: 'We can confirm that there was an incident at Lordâ€™s cricket ground on 28 July.

'The matter was reported and is being investigated by G4S.

'This isolated occurrence is not indicative of the good working relationship between the military and G4S.'

G4S was forced to admit it had not hired enough security guards to patrol the Games just weeks before they were due to begin, requiring the Government to step in and provide 4,700 extra military personnel to plug the gaps.
