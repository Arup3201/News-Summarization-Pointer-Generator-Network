Ukrainian blonde: Mother-of-one Anna Avramenko, 25, who canoe conman John Darwin met up with on Saturday night

This is the Ukrainian mail order bride that Canoe conman John Darwin fled Britain to meet up with - despite not having permission to leave the country.

Blonde-haired Anna is 38 years younger than the convicted fraudster who faces being thrown back in prison when he returns home.

Darwin, 63, is believed to have found the young woman on a website called Russiancupid.com and paid a £2,000 introduction fee.

He was seen at the weekend with her on a night out in Sumy - 1,700 miles from his home in Hartlepool.

The fraudster was jailed for six years and 
three months in 2008 for claiming £500,000 in insurance 
money with his then wife Anne.

He
 was declared dead in 2003 – a year after apparently drowning on a canoe
 trip. Yet he was living in a hidden part of the pair’s home before they
 moved to Panama in 2007.

The swindle deceived the police, a coroner, a number of financial institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony.

Under
 the terms of his early release on licence from prison in 2011, Darwin 
was not allowed to leave the UK without Probation Service permission.

It
 is understood a warrant will be issued for his arrest so he will be 
held as soon as he returns to the country. He will be forced to serve 
out the remaining nine months of his prison sentence.

Last night Darwin was thought to be staying in the Ukrainian capital Kiev and considering his next move.

The Ministry of Justice advised that offenders who breach the 
terms of their licence in this way will be returned to prison to serve 
the rest of their sentence.

One Probation Service source in the North East added: ‘I do not know what he was thinking by flying off to Ukraine.

‘There is an arrogance about Mr Darwin – he must have thought he could get away with it but he is very wrong about that.’

Officially
 the Probation Service refused to discuss individual cases but a 
spokesman said: ‘Any offender subject to licence supervision is required
 to gain permission from probation to travel outside of the UK; 
permission is only granted in exceptional circumstances.

‘Any offender who travels without this permission will be subject to recall to custody.

‘In these circumstances the Probation Service works closely with the police to implement the recall.’

The
 Daily Mail has learned he flew to Ukraine last Thursday before boarding
 a sleeper train for the town of Sumy in the north east of the country.

According
 to one newspaper, Darwin met his statuesque date at his hotel on 
Saturday before a two-hour meal along with another woman who 
interpreted.

When confronted by a reporter he said he had a migraine.

Told
 that it was likely the authorities would be in touch on his return, he 
replied: ‘Well, I’ll have an even bigger headache then.’

Darwin admitted
 fraud five years ago in court and received a slightly shorter sentence 
than Anne, who denied the offences.

In December 2007, he walked into a London police station claiming he had amnesia and was reunited with his stunned sons.

Darwin now lives in a £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, and survives on a pension of £138 a week.

It
 was also unclear last night which travel documents he used to visit 
Ukraine as it was thought his passport was not due to be returned to him
 until March.

The family of 
John Jones – whose birth certificate Darwin used to obtain a false 
passport before he vanished in 2002 – spoke out yesterday.

Alfred Jones 
said : ‘It’s appalling. I don’t know how he got out of the country when 
his passport was supposed to be revoked.

‘I can only think he has used another fake ID.

‘Darwin
 has become a pain in the neck for our family. It’s been six years since
 we found out he used [my brother] John’s birth certificate.

‘I
 don’t understand how he has the money to be going visiting his 
girlfriend in the Ukraine when he’s broke and living off the state.

‘I work really hard and I can’t do that.’
