You've heard of guide dogs for the blind, but what about guide dogs for those living with the nightmares of war.

This advert, which has been awarded the Dutch 'Gouden Loeki' for best commercial, highlights the work a dog can do to help those with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD).

Speaking during the production of the clip, Peter Van Der Heijden of the Royal Dutch Guide Dog Foundation, said: 'This is a very special day on which we are filming this TV commercial in order to create awareness of our veteran dogs.

The Dutch advert is to promote veteran dogs being used to help those with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

'A veteran dog helps people with post traumatic stress disorder handle the problems they have in everyday life, for instance veterans reliving a traumatic experience, or having a nightmare can be woken and calmed by the dogs.'

Creative director Niels Westra added: 'We are actually making this commercial to show that  the Royal Dutch Guide Dog Foundation (KNGF) does more than providing guide dogs for the blind.

'The commercial takes place in a country such as Afghanistan with a Dutch soldier serving in a war situation and suffering shock at what he is seeing.'

The advert was actually shot in the Netherlands, with a warzone digitally added for realism

A guide dog can help those who suffer recurring nightmares from their time spent in a war

In the advert, the soldier lies stricken on the floor after a battle, and looking to his left he spots the lifeless body of a little girl, leading him to break down.

A colleague then comforts him, and as he starts to lick the soldier's cheek, the scene cuts to the man's bedroom, where it is in fact the dog that is calming him.

The dog is clever enough to switch the light on to relieve the nightmare.
