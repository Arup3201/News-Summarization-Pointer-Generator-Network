Australian soccer fans across the country are cringing in unison as their Socceroos prepare for next month's FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

The team's new slogan, which will be displayed on their tour bus and used in promotional material, will read 'Socceroos: Hopping our way into history!'

The slogan was selected via an online poll which opened in February and was conducted by FIFA, the team's sponsor Hyundai and their official bus supplier.

'Socceroos: Hopping our way into history' has been selected as the official team slogan for the FIFA World Cup which kicks off next month

The words will be displayed on the team's tour bus which will be their mode of transportation around Brazil

Twitter backlash: Soccer fans instantly slammed the slogan on social media

But despite the open voting, Twitter exploded when the slogan was revealed, with fans openly expressing their disgust.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Who was the muppet who came up with our slogan for the World Cup? Hopping our way to world embarrassment for sure'.

Another also expressed his hatred for the slogan, writing: ' Why must we keep embarrassing ourselves on a global stage, Hopping our way into history.. Really'.

'Why must we keep embarrassing ourselves?' Fans weren't shy about expressing their disgust

Australia's new anthem for the World Cup, Samantha Jade's single Up, has also received criticism due to the song's lack of relevance to soccer

Meanwhile a competition run under the hashtag Better World Cup Slogans, quickly popped up with the site's users trying to outdo each other with the most witty and insulting new slogans.

'What would beating us *really* achieve?' one user suggested, while another offered: 'Can't defend our goal. Can defend our borders. Brutally.'

But is Australia's new slogan really the worst of the lot?

A competition under the hashtag name Better World Cup Slogans, soon broke out over Twitter with users sharing their hilarious ideas

Chile and Netherland's slogans were also ridiculed over social media

The other countries being ridiculed for their choice of words include Chile, whose slogan is 'CHI CHI CHI!, LE LE LE! Go Chile' and the Netherlands, who went with, 'Real Men Wear Orange'.

But it's not just their new slogan that Australian soccer fans are upset with. Supporters are also voicing their frustrations about the team's anthem, sung by Samantha Jade, which they say has nothing to do with football.
