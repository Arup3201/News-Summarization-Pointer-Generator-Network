Large cruise ships  will finally be barred from Venice's historic centre, the Italian government has confirmed.

The huge liners dubbed the 'skyscrapers of the sea' can currently can pass within 1,000ft of the iconic St. Mark's Square, granting a stunning view to those aboard but dwarfing Venice's Byzantine architecture.

Now Italian ministers have reached the unanimous decision to stop liners of over 96,000 tonnes  from sailing in Saint Mark's basin and the Giudecca Canal (the waterway which separates the main core of Venice from the separate island of Giudecca, immediately to the south).

No more: Large cruise ships will longer be able to sail in Saint Mark's basin and the Giudecca Canal

The decision comes after Michael Douglas and Cate Blanchett added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as St Mark’s Basilica.

Other big-screen figures also on the list of endorsees included Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, Sir Michael Caine, Edward Norton, Susan Sarandon and Isabella Rossellini.

Julie Christie, whose most iconic film – the 1973 supernatural thriller Don’t Look Now – was set in Venice, also signed the petition. 

Transport minister Maurizio Lupi announced the decision, saying: 'It seems to me to be a balanced solution which takes account of our duty to remove the skyscrapers of the sea from the canals of Venice, while safeguarding a world heritage city that is the envy of the world and protecting the city’s economy which is so linked to cruise tourism.'

The news will be music to the ears of Venetians, environmentalists and the celebrities who voiced concern about tourist vessels sailing close to the fragile city. 

Plea: Hollywood stars Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Cate Blanchett signed a petition in June

Decision: Liners of over 96,000 tonnes will be banned from entering the waters near Venice's historic centre

The open letter, penned by the celebrities, read: 'Dear Prime Minister, dear Minister,

'Having prevailed against flood, pestilence, and war for more than thirteen centuries, Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, and unparalleled UNESCO Word Heritage site, now, in a moment of relative tranquility, finds herself mortally threatened by the daily transit of gargantuan ocean liners, indifferent to the probable risk of catastrophe.

'Since the flood of 1966, Italy and countless Italian and international supporters have contributed to the defense of the world's most fragile city, eternally subject to destruction.

'The absolute lack of respect presented by the outlandish spectacle of the ongoing obstruction and potentially destruction, of one of humanity’s pre-eminent monuments is not only dumbfounding but both morally and culturally unacceptable.

'We urgently request an immediate and irrevocable halt to the traffic of the Big Ships in front of San Marco and along the Giudecca Canal putting an end to this senseless devastation.'  

No big ships: Demonstrators have been increasingly vocal about the presence of cruise ships in Venice

Stunning views: There has been a long-standing concern the ships might cause damage and omit smog

Mr Lupi said Italy was agreeing the changes with cruise ship operators, and did not want to discourage those companies from doing business in Italy as they are an 'important resource'. 

He has now commissioned an environmental analysis of the nearby Contorta-Sant'Angelo canal, which has been chosen as a possible alternative route for larger vessels to reach Venice's maritime station. 

Venice started to restrict the movements of cruise ships in its waters earlier this year. 

January brought a reduction of 20 per cent on the number of ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes authorised to enter the Giudecca Canal.

The sinking of the 114,500-tonne Costa Concordia liner off the Tuscan coast in 2012, which killed 32 people, has heightened concerns about enormous cruise ships in Italy's waters.
