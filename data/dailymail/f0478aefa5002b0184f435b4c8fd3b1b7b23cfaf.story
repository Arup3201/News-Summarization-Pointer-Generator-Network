Deaths: William Craig Miller, 34, was convicted of fatally shooting a couple and their three children in Arizona

A mass murderer faces the death penalty after being found guilty of killing an extended family of five.

William Craig Miller, 34, was convicted of fatally shooting Steven Duffy, 30, and Duffy’s girlfriend Tammy Lovell, 32, at their home in Mesa, Arizona, five years ago.

He was also found guilty of killing Mr Duffy's brother - Shane Duffy, 18 - and Ms Lovell's children - Cassandra Lovell, 15, and Jacob Lovell, 10.

Both Steven Duffy and Tammy Lovell were former employees of Miller's who were police informants against him in a 2005 arson case.

He was convicted of the murders and burglary at their home in February 2006 by a Maricopa County Superior Court jury on Monday.

Miller already is serving 16 years in jail after being convicted in March of burning down his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, to collect insurance money.

‘Today's verdict finally brings a measure of justice to a shockingly brutal crime that stunned the entire community,’ Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said. ‘Now we move forward in pursuit of a just punishment.’

Prosecutors will begin making arguments for the death penalty in court on Tuesday.

Miller's attorneys called no witnesses to the stand to testify on his behalf during the trial, which he did not attend himself.

He was an ‘arrogant braggart’ who tried to hire four hit-men but ended up acting alone when they wouldn't help, Kristen Hoffmeyer, prosecuting, said.

‘He eliminated them as witnesses, and he eliminated their family because there was to be no witnesses left,’ she added.

Ms Hoffmeyer showed graphic photos of the crime scene, prompting the victims' family members to cry in court.

Eric Kessler, defending, had urged jurors to keep an open mind, reported the Arizona Republic. ‘Things are not always as they seem,’ he had said.
