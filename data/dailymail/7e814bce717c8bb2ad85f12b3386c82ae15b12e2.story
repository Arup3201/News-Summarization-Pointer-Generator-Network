Hubble has captured the rare sight of three of Jupiter's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet's banded face.

The telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — Europa, Callisto and Io — in action 601 million miles (968 million km) from Earth. 

The Jovian lunar gathering, which happens only once or twice a decade, was captured on January 23 showing the unusual sight in a single frame.

Hubble has captured the rare sight of three of Jupiter's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet's banded face. The telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — Europa, Callisto and Io — in action 601 million miles (968 million km) from Earth.

Jupiter and its moons have long fascinated astronomers. The ones seen in these images are called Galilean satellites — named after the 17th century scientist Galileo Galilei who discovered them.

They complete orbits around Jupiter ranging from two to seventeen days in duration.

Each of the moons can commonly be seen transiting the face of Jupiter and casting shadows onto its layers of cloud.

The image on the left shows the Hubble observation at the beginning of the event. On the left is the moon Callisto and on the right, Io. The shadows from Europa, which cannot be seen in the image, Callisto, and Io are strung out from left to right

Astronomers believe the rough, icy surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa, is the most likely place in the solar system to harbour alien life.

'For the first time in the history of humanity we have the tools and technology and capability to potentially answer this question. And, we know where to go to find it,' Kevin Hand, a Nasa astrobiologist, said last year.

The $18.5 billion Nasa budget recently proposed by the White House for next year includes money earmarked for a mission to the moon. 

Previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon's icy crust. This ocean covers Europa entirely and contains more liquid water than all of Earth's oceans combined.

Europa is the sixth closest moon to Jupiter and the smallest of the four Galilean satellites that belong to the planet. It is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface.

The moon Io, which orbits significantly closer to Jupiter and so moves much more quickly, can be seen approaching the eastern limb of the planet.

While Callisto's shadow seems hardly to have moved, Io's has set over the planet's eastern edge and Europa's has risen further in the west.

Missing from this sequence is the Galilean moon Ganymede which was outside Hubble's field of view.

Each moons of Jupiter have very distinctive colours. The smooth icy surface of Europa is yellow-white, the volcanic sulphur surface of Io is orange and the surface of Callisto, is a brownish colour.

The moons are bigger than all the dwarf planets, and Ganymede, Callisto and Io are all larger than Earth's moon. Ganymede, meanwhile, is larger than the planet Mercury.

The images were taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 in visible light.

While Hubble captures these moons in great clarity, Nasa says they can also be seen with a small telescope or even a strong pair of binoculars from home.
