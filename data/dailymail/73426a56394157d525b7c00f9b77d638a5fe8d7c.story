A mother whose 13-year-old daughter was declared brain dead after what should have been a routine tonsillectomy says she cannot bring herself to take her daughter off life support.

Nailah Winkfield of Oakland, California, has pleaded for prayers and time to keep her daughter, Jahi McMath, on a ventilator past Monday, when a temporary restraining order barring a hospital from disconnecting life support expires.

‘They have been pressuring me to “pull the plug”,’ Winkfield wrote in an open letter released this weekend. ‘I can't. I won't. I can't let them kill my baby a second time.’

‘Despite what they say, she is alive. I can touch her, she is warm. She responds to my touch. Given time I know (God) will spark her brain awake.’

Children's Hospital of Oakland's responded in a statement that while it sympathizes with Winkfield's wishes, ‘it would be unfair to give false hope that Jahi will come back to life.’

Jahi was admitted to hospital on December 9 to undergoing a ‘simple procedure’ to remove her tonsil to help with her sleep apnea.

But the girl suffered complications and began bleeding profusely from her nose and mouth for hours, Winkfield said.

McMath then went into cardiac arrest, and was revived by doctors, only for them to declare that she was brain dead on December 12.

The hospital statement contends the surgery was complicated, and that it was committed to fully investigating what caused ‘this catastrophic outcome.’

A judge ruled on Friday to keep Jahi on a ventilator and continue giving her intravenous fluids through to Monday, when a court-approved neurologist will examine the girl for any signs of brain activity.

The family's attorney, Christopher Dolan, told Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo the family wanted independent tests because they do not believe the hospital's physicians are sufficiently independent.

The hospital said in documents presented to the court on Friday that a staff neurologist and Jahi's attending physician conducted separated exams, both of which determined that Jahi's entire brain, including her brain stem, stopped functioning.

Ruling: Nailah Winkfield's daughter will be evaluated by an independent doctor on Monday and then a decision on her future will be taken

‘There is absolutely no medical possibility that (Jahi's) condition is reversible or that she will someday recover from death,’ declarations from the doctors said. ‘Thus, there is no medical justification to provide any further medical treatment whatsoever to (her).’

The family told ABC station KGO-TV in San Francisco they will hold a march and rally Monday at 9:30 a.m. PT outside the hospital. They said the rally will be peaceful and lawful.

'Jahi's favorite color is purple. So if you can come out wearing a purple shirt, it doesn't matter what shade it is. But if you have a purple shirt, please wear it and march with us Monday morning,' McMaths's uncle, Omari Sealey, said.

Winkfield told KGO-TV on Friday she was grateful just to have three more days with her daughter.

'It is hard because I feel like I'm just on borrowed time with my daughter,' Winkfield said. 'I will fight for my daughter until I can't fight anymore and I don't know when a mother loses a fight for her children.'

After her daughter underwent a 
supposedly routine tonsillectomy and was moved to a recovery room, 
Nailah Winkfield began to fear something was going horribly wrong.

Jahi was sitting up in bed, her hospital gown bloody, and holding a pink cup full of blood.

'Is this normal?' Winkfield repeatedly asked nurses.

With
 her family and hospital staff trying to help and comfort her, Jahi kept
 bleeding profusely for the next few hours then went into cardiac 
arrest, her mother said.

In an interview at 
Children's Hospital Oakland on Thursday night, Winkfield described the 
nightmarish turn of events after her daughter underwent tonsil removal 
surgery to help with her sleep apnea.

She said that even before 
the surgery, her daughter had expressed fears that she wouldn't wake up 
after the operation. To everyone's relief, she appeared alert, was 
talking and even ate a Popsicle afterward.

Apprehensive: Jahi was nervous about undergoing surgery but her mother assured her she'd be fine. As she was recovering, she was bleeding from the mouth and nose and suffered cardiac arrest

But about a half-hour 
later, shortly after the girl was taken to the intensive care unit, she 
began bleeding from her mouth and nose despite efforts by hospital staff
 and her family.

While the bleeding continued, Jahi wrote her 
mother notes. In one, the girl asked to have her nose wiped because she 
felt it running. Her mother said she didn't want to scare her daughter 
by saying it was blood.

'My
 daughter had actual clots sliding out of her mouth and they gave me a 
cup and said, "Here, catch them with the cup so we can measure them,"' 
Winkfield told ABC 7.

Family members said there were containers
 of Jahi's blood in the room, and hospital staff members were providing 
transfusions to counteract the blood loss.

'I don't know what a 
tonsillectomy is supposed to look like after you have it, but that blood
 was un-normal for anything,' Winkfield said.

The family said hospital officials told them in a meeting Thursday that they want to take the girl off life support quickly.

'I just looked at the doctor to his face and I told him you better not touch her,' Winkfield recalled.

The
 family filed a request Friday for a temporary restraining order 
prohibiting the hospital from taking Jahi off life support or any of her
 other current treatment.

Speaking to CNN's Piers Morgan Tuesday night, Nailah Winkfield said she believed her daughter could still wake up.

'I
 don't want to take my daughter off life support because I love my 
child,' an emotional Winkfield said. 'When I walked her into that 
hospital, she was perfectly fine, there was nothing wrong with her. She 
had no health problems.

'As long as she has a pulse, we want her on life support,' Sealey said. 'We want her to come home for Christmas. We want to give her presents. We want a chance for a Christmas miracle.'
