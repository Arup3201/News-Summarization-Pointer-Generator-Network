Britain's biggest chain of bakers was left red-faced today after the logo that appears when it is searched on Google was changed to: 'Greggs: Providing s*** to scum for over 70 years.'

The chain, which has flourished on the high street over the last decade and has more than 1,600 shops, fell victim to an unknown prankster.

Greggs' Wikipedia page was also targeted this afternoon with a crude message that was quickly taken down.

Greggs, whose actual logo is 'Always fresh. Always tasty', said on its official Twitter feed said it was aware of the change and was speaking to Google about it.

Bold new marketing plan? The logo of Greggs, the chain of bakers, was changed by an online prankster today

The logo as it's supposed to appear. Greggs quickly contacted Google over the offensive logo

The chain's Twitter account was bombarded with users letting them know about the vulgar logo, and the social media team seemed to take the problem in good humour, even contacting Google's UK Twitter account and offering them a tray of doughnuts should they get to the source of the problem.

In other tweets, Greggs said : 'All publicity is good publicity? That's what they say isn't it? *weeps alone in a corner*'.

The firm added: 'We've been working with Google all morning to try and fix it! Hopefully get it sorted soon!!'

Google was not immediately available for comment. 

Some cheeky commenters suggested that the slogan was more honest than their usual catchphrase.

A twitter user going by @My6Percent wrote: 'Somebody in @GreggstheBakers SEO team is in for a world of pain. What an accurate strapline.'

And Christopher Haines tweeted: 'Greggs doesn't seem to turn up favourable search results. What a logo! #Greggs'

@RosieLondoner said: 'Someone at Google doesn't like sausage rolls.'

At around 3.50 pm the offensive Greggs logo vanished from Google searches.

A spokeswoman said the company had 'urgently' asked the search giant to remove it.

She said: 'We are aware of the abusive logo and have made a formal complaint to Google and asked them to rectify this as a matter of urgency.

'Now it looks like the situation has been rectified and everything is back on track.

'We are still investigating exactly what happened.'

The company celebrated by tweeting: 'Aaaand relax! Maybe those kind folks @GoogleUK could give us the doodle tomorrow?'

A picture of the word 'Google' made out of sausage rolls was attached to the tweet.

The logo was hosted by the website Uncyclopedia, a satirical website that riffs on online encyclopedia Wikipedia.

David Emm, an expert on internet security at software security firm Kaspersky Lab, said problems like this are hard for firms to combat as online information about them is often hosted on sites that can be edited by anyone.

He said: 'There is always a chance someone slips in a modification of some sort.'

In the 1940s John Gregg opened a small bakery on Gosforth, Newcastle, in 1951. His son Ian Gregg took over the family business in 1964 and the chain began to grow by acquiring regional bakery retailers across the UK.

By 1984, Greggs had more than 260 shops in four main areas of the country and was listed on the Stock Exchange.

During the 2000s Greggs continued to grow rapidly and today has more than 1,600 shops.
