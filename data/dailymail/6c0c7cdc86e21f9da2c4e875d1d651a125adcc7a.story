Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC said he was 'probably doing the wrong thing' by letting burglar Jason Dalfred 
Wheatley walk free

A top judge has said he was 'probably doing the wrong thing' as he let a burglar walk free.  

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC made the comment as he sentenced Jason Dalfred Wheatley who was once given a three-year jail-term for being a passenger in a stolen car which killed an eight-year-old boy.

He passed a 10-month prison sentence, but suspended it, telling Wheatley: ‘I strongly believe that you should be ordered to serve that immediately.

'But I am just going to give you one last chance. But understand this; it is your last chance.’

He suspended the sentence for two years with 18 months' supervision and a year’s drug rehabilitation.

He
added: ‘I firmly believe I'm probably doing the wrong thing here. If 
you come back before me I will know I've done the wrong thing.’

Wheatley, 24, was at Teesside Crown Court for sentencing after he pleaded guilty to a home burglary.

He was jailed for a year for another domestic burglary in October 2011.

Judge
Bourne-Arton said this might have been termed 'merciful' for an 
offender with a history of drunken crime and flouting court orders.

Wheatley
offended again - taking a vehicle without consent and driving while 
unfit - and was given a community order by magistrates in November last 
year.

Within a week of appearing in court for breaching that order, he committed the latest burglary on Grassington Road, Beechwood, Middlesbrough, on February 1.

He was seen climbing over a fence in a neighbouring garden, dropping a stolen laptop as he went, said prosecutor Sue Jacobs.

After he was detained in the garden, he told police he'd been drinking and taking cocaine and MCAT.

An
accomplice, Craig Andrew Gibson, 24, of Beechwood, Middlesbrough, was 
caught inside the burgled home and sentenced by magistrates last  month.

He received a one-year community order with alcohol treatment, supervision and 50 hours' unpaid work, and ordered him to pay £75 compensation with £145 costs.

Wheatley, of Beechwood, admitted burglary. When he was 18, he was locked up for four years - later reduced to three years on appeal - for aggravated vehicle taking.

He was one of two passengers in the stolen Rover Metro that hit and killed eight-year-old Daniel Conroy Curtin in Riverside Park on May 16, 2006.

This previous conviction was not mentioned in the burglary hearing. Duncan McReddie, defending, said Wheatley went from denial to confession in a 16-minute police interview on overwhelming evidence.

He said Wheatley was determined to rid himself of drug and alcohol addiction and had sought help.

After reading a letter from Wheatley, the judge said: ‘Now you say you have learned your lesson.’                                                                                                                                

He said Wheatley had told him the same thing he told the judge for his previous burglary - that it was spontaneous and drink-fuelled.                     

He told Wheatley he wouldn't accept any excuses if he breached the new order, and 'it won't wash' if he re-offended and said he was sorry.
