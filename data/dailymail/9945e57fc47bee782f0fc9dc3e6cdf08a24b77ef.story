This is the moment a mother was reunited with her two young daughters six months after they were kidnapped and taken to Mexico by their father.

Alejandra Martinez-Castelo rushed to police in panic after her estranged partner offered to babysit the girls, aged two and eight, at her home in Salinas, California, then disappeared.

She had gone out for a few hours but when she returned home they were nowhere to be found.

Tearful: This is the moment Alejandra Martinez-Castelo was reunited with her daughters aged two and eight

Distraught, she told officers she had reason to believe the girls' father, Marco Torres-Ramirez, had taken them to Mexico, KTVU reported.

In June, a family member told Castelo the girls had been spotted in Mexico.

The tip-off sparked and international search involving multiple law enforcement agencies.

They then managed to track down the two-year-old girl abandoned in a house near the border. She was taken into protective custody.

Weeks later, the eight-year-old was also tracked to a nearby location in Mexico. 

Kidnapped: The girls' father offered to babysit them at home in Salinas, California, but took them to Mexico

Funded by the Department of Justice, Child Abduction Unit Investigator Maribel Torres-Hart and Monterey County district attorney's Investigator Tracey Spencer flew to Mexico to attend court hearings and retrieve the two young girls.

Finally, months later, the girls were airlifted to the border of Monterey County where they were tearfully reunited with their mother.

County prosecutors said in a statement: 'The family was overcome with emotion during this reunion and are adjusting to being back home.'

They did not disclose what happened to Marco Torres-Ramirez.
