The Duchess of Cambridge's sister Pippa and her brother James have met the royal baby but it was unclear today whether their partners were also at Kensington Palace.

Today it was revealed that Prince Harry may also have been there as the future king met his parents' siblings.

Royal sources say that Pippa and James 
Middleton enjoyed cuddles with the prince as soon as he arrived home from hospital.

But it also emerged that Pippa's banker boyfriend Nico Jackson may also have been at the secret meeting, 
raising questions about whether James' girlfriend, TV presenter and 
model Donna Air, may have also been afforded the same privilege.

Happy event: James Middleton is said to have met his sister's child last night but it is unclear if his girlfriend Donna Air was there too

Couple: Pippa Middleton was also at Kensington Palace, and it was reported her boyfriend Nico (pictured together at Wimbledon) was there too

It was another first for the Middletons yesterday, 
because the Duchess's parents Carole and Michael were also the first 
family members to meet their grandchild.

Miss Air has been dating James Middleton since the beginning of the year, and will no doubt be looking forward to meeting her beau's new nephew, and future king.

MailOnline approached her agent today, but they refused to comment on whether Donna has yet.

In the hours before the child was discharged from hospital, the 33-year-old TV presenter and her nine-year-old daughter were the Dogs Trust Awards ceremony at London's Home House.

Gathering: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived back at Kensington Palace this evening with their son. Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson were waiting to meet the new arrival

Celebration: Crowds of people waved and cheered as the young family headed into their home

Prince 
Harry, who is said to be thrilled to have become an uncle, has met his nephew, having raced back to 
London from Wattisham airbase in Suffolk where he is on duty with the RAF.

Prince William and Kate were last night pictured
 arriving into the grounds of Kensington Palace after earlier leaving 
the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London.

Kate and William had waved in front of screaming 
crowds and masses of journalists from around the world as they left the 
hospital, 26 hours after the heir to the throne was delivered, weighing 
8lbs 6oz.

The proud parents are expected to spend two weeks at Kensington Palace while William is on paternity 
leave.

Speaking outside the hospital 
earlier, an obviously moved Duchess of Cambridge said: 'It's been very 
emotional. Any parent will know what this feeling is like.'

Family time: Pippa Middleton has travelled to Kensington Palace where she will this evening meet her new nephew. The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William show their baby outside the hospital earlier

Proud: The Royal couple looked thrilled as they showed off the baby to the media outside the hospital

Home: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge headed to Kensington Palace in west London after leaving the hospital this evening

The Duke of Cambridge had followed the steps his parents Charles and Diana took with him 31 years ago, when he was born there on June 21, 1982.

'He's a big boy, quite heavy. We're still working on a name,' he told reporters.

'Well he has a good pair of lungs on him, that's for sure’

Confirming that the prince was overdue, William said: ‘I will remind him of his tardiness when he is older.’

With a huge smile he then added: ‘He’s got her looks thankfully’ to which the Duchess responded ‘No, no, no I’m not sure about that.’

The Duchess wore a lilac purple dress, with her long hair falling in waves around her face. The new father wore a  blue open neck shirt rolled up to his sleeves with black trousers.

The couple then returned in to the 
hospital as William held his son, swaddled in a blanket, before bringing
 him out again in his car seat

William
 then breathed a huge sigh of relief when he successfully installed his 
baby on the back seat with his wife, before driving them home to 
Kensington Palace surrounded by a cheering crowd.

Carole and Michael Middleton were the first to arrive at the private
 Lindo Wing at around 3pm today, with Prince Charles and his wife 
Camilla following them at 5.30pm after being rushed to London by 
helicopter after two-days carrying out official duties in Yorkshire.

Before
 mounting the St Mary's Hospital steps, the smiling Prince of Wales 
asked journalists who have been stood outside for almost three weeks: 
'Have you been there long?'
