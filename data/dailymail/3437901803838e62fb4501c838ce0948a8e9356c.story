England boss Roy Hodgson says that 'without a shadow of a doubt' Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be fit to appear at the World Cup.

The Arsenal winger was injured against Ecuador on Wednesday but attended Saturdayâ€™s game with Honduras without the need for his protective knee brace.

And, following the goalless draw in Miami, Hodgson said: 'Everyone is fit. Oxlade-Chamberlain is making good progress. I think he'll make the tournament without a shadow of a doubt.'

Hodgson hopes the Ox will be fit to face Costa Rica on June 24 but he will almost certainly miss the opening two group games against Italy and Uruguay.

The 20-year-old had impressed during the 2-2 draw with Ecuador before suffering medial ligament damage late in the game.
