Facebook is treating their on-site bus drivers like 'servants,' according to a local workers union.

The social media giant employs drivers to take their staff on shuttle-buses to their Silicon Valley HQ, but are accused of paying them so little they cannot afford to live in the area.

The drivers are now hoping to unionize and join the local Teamsters enclave in order to force Facebook to cut a better deal with the contractor they work for. 

Unliked: A sign with the 'like' symbol stands in front of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, where bus drivers are now trying to unionize for better working conditions 

The bus drivers take Facebook's employees to the officers in Menlo Park, California, but are employed by a contractor, Loop Transportation.

The local Teamsters union has written an open letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of the drivers, accusing Facebook of behaving like the days of Downton Abbey.

'While your employees earn extraordinary wages and are able to live and enjoy life in some of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the Bay Area, these drivers can’t afford to support a family, send their children to school or, least of all, afford to even dream of buying a house anywhere near where they work,' Teamsters official, Rome Aloise said in the letter published by the New York Times.

'It is reminiscent of a time when noblemen were driven around in their coaches by their servants.

'Frankly, little has changed; except the noblemen are your employees, and the servants are the bus drivers who carry them back and forth each day.'

Most of the drivers employed by Loop for Facebook earn $18-$20 per hour and work split shifts.

This means starting at 6am to shuttle workers in to the Menlo Park offices until 11am, and then a six hour break until it is time to take the Facevook employees home again.

The drivers complain that as they cannot afford to live in the area, their homes are too far away for them to go home on their break, and are hoping to negotiate new shift hours.

Mr Aloise told the NY Times that he hopes to help the Facebook drivers first and then move on to broker similar deals with drivers working for Google, Apple and other Silicon Valley giants.
