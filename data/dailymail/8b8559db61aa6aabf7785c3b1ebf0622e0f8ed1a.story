Prince Harry was reunited with his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy during a charity carol concert in London last night.

Chelsy, who remains a close friend of Prince Harry, was pretty in a red jumper  as she arrived for the service at St Luke's Church in Chelsea.

There, she heard both Harry and William pay heartfelt tribute to their friend Henry van Straubenzee, who was killed in a car crash in 2002 aged just 18 years old.

Good humoured: Prince Harry chats with a friend outside St Luke's Parish Church in Chelsea

Since his death, the foundation set up in his memory has raised enough money to support the education of more than 26,000 children in 39 schools across Uganda.

Harry, who attended the Ludgrove prep school in Berkshire with Mr van Straubenzee, remembered his friend in an address made to an 800-strong congregation, which also included Pippa Middleton and Ellie Goulding.

After describing van Straubenzee as 'a Polzeath surfing legend and ladies' man with whom we shared so many special memories', to much laughter, Harry continued:

'I'm sure you understand when I say most of those memories are not suitable for public consumption, let alone in the house of God.'

The Duke of Cambridge struck a more sombre note, telling the congregation, who had gathered at St Luke's Parish Church in Chelsea, that 'we are here, of course, to remember Henry.'

'He was a friend to many people here and a very special friend to us, who we share so many happy childhood memories with.

'Henry would be amazed that his charity is giving so many children a chance in life. He certainly enjoyed his.'

The service, which also included readings by author Santa Montefiore and historian Dan Snow, was rounded off by a performance from Goulding who sang Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, at the request of Prince Harry.

The surviving van Straubenzee brothers remain close friends with the two princes, with both attending the 2013 wedding of Thomas van Straubenzee.

Chelsy Davy, who met the brothers while in a relationship with Prince Harry, is also a friend, as is Prince William's sister-in-law, Pippa Middleton.
