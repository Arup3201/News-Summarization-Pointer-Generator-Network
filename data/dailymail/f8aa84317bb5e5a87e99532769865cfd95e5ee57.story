Western Sydney Wanderers have become the first A-League side to win the Asian Champions League, but the win was dampened by dirty tactics with the Sydney side targeted by spitting, headbutting and lasers.

After a scoreless game, Tony Popovic's Sydney side won 0-1 on aggregate in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh in just their third year season of football.

Bitter losers Al Hilal reacted badly to their loss at fulltime, instigating a raging fight.

Enraged Al Hilal forward Nasser Al-Shamrani spat at Wanderers' player Matthew Spiranovic before lunging at him, provoking a brawl between the two sides before they were separated.

Moments earlier, during the added five minutes of injury time, Al-Shamrani appeared to also deliberately headbutt the Wanderers' defender which was not pulled up by the referee.

Throughout the game, Wanderers' goalkeepers Ante Covic had lasers flashed at his eyes in a dirty tactic from fans in the 70,000-person strong crowd.

Despite the confrontation, the Wanderers were ecstatic about the victory.

'To come such a long way in the short history of this club and win a title like this ... I'm so proud,' said Wanderers goalkeeper Ante Covic, who was named player of the tournament.

'Tonight is very special and it's not going to be forgotten.'

'Dreams do come true,' said celebrated coach, Tony Popovic, who had lead the three-year-old side to victory

A delighted Popovic said the game was everything you'd expect from a final.

'It was difficult, they're a very good team, they had fantastic support,' the coach said.

'But as I said yesterday, we're an excellent team and we showed over two legs how good we are.

'For me, I am just proud for these players and our club. The first time in the competition, to win it, I think in the future we will really understand how special this run has been and how it was to win this title.

'We don't have the resources or the funds that some of these other teams have, but we have something that money can't buy - the desire to win.'

Japanese referee Nishimura Yuichi has been criticised for waving away two penalty decisions either side of halftime.

'We don't have the resources or the funds that some of these other teams have, but we have something that money can't buy - the desire to win,' said coach Popovic of the win

When Antony Golec stretched and found Nawaf Al-Abid rather than the ball, it seemed the roaring crowd would have their penalty.

But the decision didn't come, incensing Al-Hilal boss Laurentiu Reghecampf.

The referee again kept his whistle quiet on the hour when Covic clearly slid in on Salman Al Faraj.

The on-field dramas did not detract from the Wanderers' supporters elation, with around 5000 people crowded into Parramatta's Centenary Square to watch the game and celebrate the club's historic ACL cup win.

The square erupted when the Wanderers secured the win, with fans setting off flares– a habit which is proving difficult for Wanderers fans to kick, despite costing the club $5000 each time one is ignited under ACL regulations.

The fans were chanting and beating drums before the game, but all fell silent at the kick-off at King Fahd Stadium and stayed that way for most of the first half, as neither side could find the back of the net.

The chanting started building again around sunrise as the match reached its final moments - and a 0-0 draw delivered the trophy to the Wanderers 1-0 on aggregate after their first leg win at home last weekend.

Die-hard fan Steve Marvello sobbed as the final whistle blew and the Wanderers became the first ever Australian team to win the ACL.

'This is the most amazing moment in Western Sydney's history,' he told AAP.

'The crowd is going off. Everyone's just being really supportive of the boys.

'(Coach Tony) Popovic is awesome.'

'Our goalkeeper was amazing. He was our machine all the way through,' said Marcelo Canales, who was wearing head-to-toe merchandise and waving a team flag.

Her family would be at the airport 'for sure' to welcome home the team on Monday, she said.

The Western Sydney Wanderers, in just their third season, are one of the A-League's most supported clubs.

More than 200 fans expressed interest in heading to the match in Riyadh, but only 14 managed to negotiate Saudi Arabia's strict visa requirements and high travel costs.

The Parramatta City Council set up the event in Centenary Square following huge community interest on social media.

Lord Mayor Scott Lloyd told AAP the win would strengthen Western Sydney's soccer community.

'I think it's a true indication of what we are out here in the west. We rise to the occasion,' he told AAP.

'We have a lot of talent, a lot of ability and our players really showed it off tonight.'

The crowds remained chanting until well past the end of the game and car horns sounded through Parramatta's main streets as they left.
