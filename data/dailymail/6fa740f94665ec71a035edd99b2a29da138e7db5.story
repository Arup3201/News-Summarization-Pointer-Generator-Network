Ban: Joy Tomkins with her £1 doll that has been withdrawn from sale because it has an Olympic outfit and is in breach of copyright laws

With her big blue eyes, blonde mane and a hand-knitted 2012 Olympics running kit, this doll would make a perfect addition to any little girl’s collection.

But not if the jobsworths of the Olympics authorities have anything to do with it.

Rigid copyright rules over the London 2012 logo mean the widow who made the doll’s outfit cannot put her into a church fundraising sale.

Joy Tomkins, 81, spent hours creating the kit for the second-hand doll, which was to go on sale with a £1 price tag.

But after hearing that Olympics officials jealously guarded their logos, she decided to check with trading standards officers about the tiny GB 2012 and Olympic rings she had embroidered on the T-shirt. To her shock, she was told to withdraw the doll from sale to avoid legal action.

The grandmother of six, from Downham Market, Norfolk, says the rules are ‘21st-century silliness’ and she has written to Olympics chief Lord Coe to complain.

‘This is absolutely ridiculous. I thought that the hoops symbol was universal and I think it is disgusting that they can make rules about such little things. It’s Olympic correctness gone mad,’ she said.

The doll was handed in to Mrs Tomkins’ charity knitting group by a member of public and she decided to replace its tired outfit.

Red-tape: The tiny GB 2012 and Olympic rings on the doll's knitted jumper were enough to breach strict copyright rules

Rules: Strict laws have been brought in to ensure that only official stores can sell London 2012 Olympic merchandise

In the UK selling anything with Olympic Games or London 2012 names or logos is illegal unless you are an official sponsor.

That is why companies like Coca-Cola and McDonalds pay so much for the privilege.

In the UK, special laws have also been passed to give extra protection.

People are being prosecuted under the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 and anyone found guilty will get a fine of at least £10,000 and a potential jail term.

But many innocent members of the public are being threatened with the same legislation.

Last year the British Sugarcraft Guild was told it could face court proceedings.

Its annual festival of cakes was planned with an Olympic theme but had to be dumped after they were told it would be illegal.

They wanted to depict the 2012 games logos in icing and marzipan but the the International Olympic Committee banned them from copying any of its official symbols, including the five rings.

It was about to go on a stall at a fundraising sale at a church earlier this month when the retired magazine worker was warned about Olympic copyright.

Mrs Tomkins said: ‘The doll was taken off the stall and the next Wednesday when I met the group they were in high dudgeon. They were all for marching on the issue.

‘I have considered sending a picture of the doll in her outfit to Lord Coe with two added words emblazoned across it – Spoil Sport.

Maybe I should have just sewn “Global gathering of top athletes in England’s capital this year” but unfortunately the T-shirt just wasn’t large enough.’

The 10in tall doll named Olympia was being sold to raise money for the group’s wool fund.

A Locog spokesman said permission to reproduce the rings had to be given by the International Olympic Committee. ‘It’s like selling something with the Nike logo – even for £1 that would be wrong,’ he added.

But we’re not like Big Brother. We’ll take things on a case-by-case basis.’ 

A spokesman for Norfolk County Council said: ‘We were asked whether there was any legislation covering the sale of goods carrying the Olympic rings and we said yes there is, which is indeed the case.’

The official London 2012 website states: ‘There may be cases where the unauthorised use of our brand is the result of pure enthusiasm for the Games without consideration of our commercial benefit or understanding our legal rights. In such cases, we will factor this into our approach.’

Those breaching the rules face civil action for damages.
