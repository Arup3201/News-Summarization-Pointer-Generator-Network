One of Britain’s leading children’s brain doctors snorted cocaine and an illegal party drug just before going on call at a major NHS hospital.

Shocking video footage shows Dr Colin Ferrie asking for a syringe to measure out the powerful sedative - a so-called ‘date rape drug’ known as GHB - before leaning over a kitchen worktop to consume a long line of cocaine.

Over nearly two debauched hours, in blatant contravention of hospital rules, the consultant paediatric neurologist took dose after dose of the highly addictive GHB and snorted nearly three grams of cocaine with an acquaintance.

Yet just over an hour later, the switchboard operator at Leeds General Infirmary where he works confirmed Dr Ferrie was on call – a role that involves making life-or-death decisions about his young patients, who suffer from disorders such as epilepsy and brain tumours. 

Following The Mail on Sunday’s investigation, the hospital has ordered an urgent inquiry and suspended the consultant from clinical work.

Last night, patients’ groups said families would be horrified that a doctor looking after children could be taking mind-altering substances.

Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said: ‘You can’t have somebody taking things like that making life-or-death decisions.’ 

Hospital rules, as laid out by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, state staff should not take any substances that affect judgment either before starting shifts or while on duty, including on call.

Yet Dr Ferrie’s recorded comments and texts to his acquaintance suggest intimate familiarity with illegal recreational drugs.

In the film footage, taken by his companion, Scots-born Dr Ferrie is shown snorting a long line of cocaine after declaring: ‘Looking good, that.’

The drug can make users over-confident and impair decision- making abilities.

It can also lead to fatal overdoses. Those caught in possession of the Class A narcotic can be jailed for up to seven years.

After snorting the cocaine, Dr Ferrie turns to his acquaintance, takes the bottle of GHB – which he refers to as ‘G’ – and measures out a dose with a teaspoon and mixes it with blackcurrant squash. The doctor warns: ‘You’ve got to be careful – really careful – that you don’t take too much of this stuff.’

He also says: ‘I love to have a wee spot of this stuff.’ When his companion says that he finds ‘it [G] hard to get hold of,’ Dr Ferrie tells him: ‘I get mine in Manchester.’

GHB – or Gamma-hydroxybutyrate – is popular with clubbers for loosening inhibitions, but its sedative effects when slipped into drinks mean it is also known as a date-rape drug. It is often referred to as liquid ecstasy. 

Government websites warn it can lead to ‘unconsciousness, coma and death’ as well as causing memory loss and affecting judgment.

Dr Ferrie also expresses his fondness for crystal meth – which he refers to by the street name ‘Tina’ – a dangerously addictive Class A drug, the effects of which can last for days.

Dr Ferrie, 51, is regarded as one of the foremost experts on childhood epilepsy and holds national and international posts on prestigious bodies. 

In 2007 he was part of a training team that received a Joint Epilepsy Council award, he is the national training adviser for the British Paediatric Neurology Association and has given evidence in court cases and inquests about children who have had seizures, including at a murder trial.

Married with a teenage daughter, Dr Ferrie has worked at Leeds General Infirmary for 18 years, while his wife Elaine is a nurse in its neonatal intensive care unit.

But just before Christmas he took time out to consume a cocktail of drugs while officially ‘on call’ for his patients.

Dr Ferrie’s secret life was brought to this paper’s attention by an acquaintance who said that they had met on 20 occasions since last June, consuming illegal drugs each time. 

‘He told me he was a doctor and that he worked at the teaching hospital in Leeds, but never went into any detail,’ said the man.

‘It is only very recently I discovered that he was working with brain-injured children. I was totally shocked that someone with that much responsibility would take so many hard drugs.’

On Wednesday, December 17, the eminent consultant took the train from his home in a village near Bradford to London on business but as soon as he started his return journey, he began making preparations for his depraved pastime.

In a series of text messages, arrangements were made for three grams of cocaine to be brought to an early-evening meeting at the acquaintance’s house, while Dr Ferrie said he would bring GHB.

Dr Ferrie asked: ‘What can you get and how much is it?’ When his acquaintance claimed he ‘can get coke’ for £30, Dr Ferrie replied: ‘OK. Get three,’ adding: ‘I have some G.’

Arriving at the man’s smart semi-detached house in Bradford at 4.40pm, Dr Ferrie wasted no time in indulging his habit. He immediately produced his bottle of GHB with the words, ‘You’re gonna like that’, before placing it next to the pile of cocaine waiting for him on the kitchen counter.

Gesturing to the cocaine, he said it was ‘looking good’ before giving a throaty chuckle.

He asked for a syringe to measure out the liquid GHB.

‘You got a syringe to measure this out?’ he asked the man.

‘Have I got a what?’

‘Like a syringe to measure this G out,’ he repeated.

The man asked the doctor what flavour squash he wanted to mix it with. ‘Do you want orange, apple or blackcurrant?’, to which the doctor replied: ‘Yeah, whatever, it doesn’t matter.’

The video then clearly showed him snorting a long line of cocaine from a chopping board.

Still short of a syringe, Dr Ferrie then started to look for a spoon. ‘Have you got a teaspoon anywhere? Is there one in this drawer?’

‘Middle drawer,’ said the man.

Dr Ferrie then stirred the cocktail of ‘G’ and juice.

He offered the drink to his acquaintance, who declined, then, after a gulp of the liquid and a line of cocaine, the pair headed to another part of the house, carrying the drugs with them. There, the conversation continued with further lines of cocaine and gulps of GHB being taken by the doctor at roughly 20-minute intervals.

In a tape-recorded conversation, the doctor extolled the pleasures of crystal meth. He asked his acquaintance: ‘Have you ever done Tina? I would love to do Tina with you one time. It is methamphetamine. Two days later, you still feel it.’

As he prepared to leave, he asked: ‘Do you want me to leave you that G? You had it before? One thing – you need at least an hour between hits, right, and you need to measure it properly.’

After a final line of cocaine, the doctor left the house, jumping into his battered Audi A4 and speeding away. Within a minute of leaving at 6.30pm, he pulled up on a side road and following a ten-minute phone call, drove off at speed but not to his marital home.

In a phone call to Leeds General Infirmary at 7.45pm, just over an hour after he left the Bradford house, The Mail on Sunday was told that Dr Ferrie was ‘on call’ although the receptionist was unable to say whether he was in the hospital or at home.

The next day he left the luxury detached home which he shares with his wife and daughter at 7.10am, from where he commuted to Leeds General, arriving just after 8am.

A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘We take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously and will be carrying out a thorough investigation. Patient safety is our main priority and we expect all members of staff to behave in a professional and appropriate manner at all times.

‘It is policy when investigating allegations of this nature that staff involved do not carry out clinical duties during the investigation.’

Trust rules make it clear that staff cannot take drugs while on call – but they are more likely to get counselling than the sack. 

It states: ‘The consumption of alcohol, or other substances that might impact on judgment or performance, by employees is considered inappropriate prior to the commencement of duty, whilst on duty, during meal breaks or at any other time when it might result in unacceptable work performance (eg on call). Being under the influence of alcohol or other substances at work can result in disciplinary action.

‘However, alcohol and drug dependency will normally be dealt with as a capability, rather than disciplinary, issue. The Trust will offer confidential support and counselling through the occupational health department and, where appropriate, by referral to external agencies.’

Dr Ferrie did not respond to requests for comment.

The doctor could also face misconduct proceedings from the General Medical Council.

Chairman of the health select committee, Dr Sarah Wollaston, said she could not comment on his circumstances but said: ‘In cases of substance abuse, we expect the GMC to act to protect patients.’
