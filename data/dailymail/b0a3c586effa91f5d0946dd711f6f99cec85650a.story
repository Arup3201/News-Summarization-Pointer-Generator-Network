Sergio Aguero ramped up his efforts to return to full fitness by visiting the Bridgewater Medical Centre in Manchester on Wednesday.

The Manchester City forward went to the health clinic for a routine check-up after damaging knee ligaments against Everton in the Premier League on December 6.

The 26-year-old lasted just three minutes of City's 1-0 defeat of the Toffees after a challenge with Muhamed Besic at the Etihad.

Aguero's injury was a cruel blow for the Argentine who has scored 19 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for Manuel Pellegrini's side this season.

In his absence, Pellegrini has been forced to deploy midfielder James Milner as an emergency striker as Aguero's fellow forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic have also been injured during the festive period.

Jovetic has since returned to the first-team set-up and Pellegrini was given an additional boost on Monday as Aguero returned to training.

City's top goalscorer later confirmed his return on Twitter, saying: 'I wanted you to know I've already started field work. Slowly but surely I'll be back at the right moment. Thanks for the wishes!'

Despite missing their star striker, the defending Premier League champions have gone unbeaten in all competitions since his injury and are level with Chelsea at the top of the table.

Aguero is unlikely to feature against Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday but could make his return when they host Arsenal on January 18.
