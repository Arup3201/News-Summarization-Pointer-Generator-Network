The Islamic State is experiencing a shortage of suicide bombers after dozens of fighters deserted the terror group or defected to rival militias.

Reports from inside the ISIS-stronghold of Raqqa claim that a rebellion among a 'martyrs battalion' is a severe blow to the ISIS leadership who recruit foreign fighters for their suicide operations.

According to the respected anti-ISIS activists, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, ISIS has seen dozens of militants earmarked for suicide operations flee the battlefield or defect to other groups.

The news comes after ISIS was forced to admit defeat in the key battle for the northern Syrian town of Kobane, where it deployed many suicide bombers in what turned out to be a lost cause. 

Recent Coalition air strikes have also decimated ISIS's leadership leaving its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi short of experienced commanders.

Terrorists: Reports from inside the ISIS-stronghold of Raqqa claim that a rebellion among a 'martyrs battalion' is a severe blow to the IS leadership who recruit foreign fighters for their suicide operations

Loss: News of the defections comes just weeks after ISIS was forced to pull out of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane (pictured) after it became little more than a vortex of death for the terror group

A source from inside Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State in Syria, told Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently that ISIS has set up road blocks and imposed strict security checks to stop suicide bombers abandoning their missions.

RIBSS's Abu Mohammed said: 'There is great tension in Raqqa city, where IS group suffered many defections in the past few days, a source from within IS has confirmed that most of defections are from suicide bombers, where these defections are considered a painful blow to the group.'

He claims anyone caught deserting their position faces summary execution. He said the constant aerial bombardment and fierce fighting in Kobane, the border town on the Turkish border, has caused many foreign fighters and members of the suicide units to desert.

ISIS leaders select foreign jihadists for suicide missions because they usually arrive in Syria with little or no battlefield experience and so have no military value.

According to one ISIS insider who fled the group, special training camps have been set up inside Syria which filter out foreigners with no military experience and prepare them for suicide operations.

A security source who works with British Muslim communities on combating extremism told MailOnline that he had been made aware of a number of British fighters who had been unprepared for the reality of Syria: 

'The problem is that young British Muslims who go over to Syria thinking they will be treated like equal brothers by IS find out very quickly that they are being told to strap on suicide vets and prepare for Jannah [heaven]....it's hardly surprising that they have cold feet about these missions.'

News of the defections comes just weeks after ISIS was forced to pull out of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane after it became little more than a vortex of death for the terror group in the face of a brave resistance from thousands of Kurdish men and women.

Last month a senior U.S. official said ISIS militants had started defying their commanders orders to venture inside the city, such was their fear of dying at the hands of Kurdish fighters. 

This reluctance to continue the fight to capture Kobane eventually led to the terrorists withdrawing to villages in the suburbs, before Kurdish troops eventually forced them to pull back even further towards their strongholds elsewhere in northern Syria. 

Experts believe that ISIS' frequent displays of increasing savagery - including the recent burning alive of Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh - is simply the terror group attempting to distract from its territorial losses and present itself as a united front still capable of monstrous acts and oppression.

Last October ISIS militants were seen raising their black flag on a hill close to Kobane and the Turkish border while Turkish soldiers stood helpless in the foreground. Kurdish resistance troops have since torn down the flag and recaptured the hill in a symbolic victory

Compounding the problems, ISIS has lost a number of high ranking commanders to sustained airstrikes from Western and Arab warplanes in recent months.

Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq.

His death and that of as many as nine others on ISIS' 18-man leadership council have forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small. 

Speaking to MailOnline, Charlie Winter from counter-extremism think tank Quilliam said: 'Obviously ISIS do get through quite a few suicide bombers but I think there's always a risk that people will run off at the last minute.'

'I do think a lot of the talk of Islamic State being in decline is to an extent wishful thinking but it certainly is having a tougher time of things now,' he said.  

'[However] there's still a broad base of support in  Iraq and Syria.It is seen as the lesser of two evils by a significant amount of people who wouldn't want to return to the status quo,' he added.

'Kobane was a great loss for Islamic State, it was a big symbolic loss. But losing Kobane doesn't mean that Islamic State is going to keep on losing everywhere. In its essence it is a nebulous entity - where it loses in one area, it can expand it another,' Mr Winter went on to say.

'For example, as it has been rolled back in Iraq, it has taken more territory in Syria. That said it's not storming across the country as it had been a few months ago and it is under much greater financial pressure now, given the price of oil,' he added.

Blew himself up: At least three British jidhadists are known to have taken part in ISIS suicide missions. Abu Hajar al-Britani carried out the attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji last November

First British suicide bomber: Abdul Waheed Majid (pictured), aka the 'Crawley bomber', was the first British militant to carry out a so-called 'martyrdom operation' in Syria last February. Abu Hajar killed eight Iraqi policemen in a suicide mission last November

At least three British jidhadists are known to have taken part in  ISIS suicide missions.

Britain's first suicide bomber in Syria was Abdul Waheed Majeed - a 41-year-old father-of-three from Crawley in West Sussex - who blew himself up in February when he drove a lorry laden with explosives into a jail in the Syrian city of Aleppo.

Video of a Majeed driving a Mad Max-style truck towards the jail before a spectacular explosion appeared on YouTube video released by the terror extremists.

Relatives said the father of three was a former lorry driver who had worked for the Highways Agency but gave up his job in 2013 to join a convoy running aid into Syria.

Photographs also emerged showing Majeed in a refugee camp before the bombing, sporting Micky Mouse ears while posing with local children.

In one picture, Majeed is seen wearing pink Minnie Mouse-style ears while he cuddles a child. In another, he is pictured kneeling surrounded by children as they give the peace sign.

Shortly after the bombing mission extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed desribed Majeed was 'a very dear brother'. 

He claimed Majeed had been an active student and valued member of the banned extremist Al-Muhajiroun organisation between 1996 and 2004 and had wanted to further the 'Muslim cause'.

Bakri said Majeed would organise his sermons in Crawley and record the lectures and distribute them, adding: 'He was a good brother. He was someone who was always at hand to help people.

'He wanted to study Islam and wanted to know what it was to be a good Muslim. He was also very interested in the issue of how we could establish an Islamic state.'

In November Kabir Ahmed, from Derby, took part in a suicide bomb attack in the town of Beiji, north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.

Shortly before the attack Ahmed had appeared on Panorama, where he said that foreign fighters were volunteering for suicide missions and asking local commanders to be pushed up the list to become a suicide bomber.

Later that month Abu Hajar al-Britani carried out the attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji, reportedly destroying a significant number of tanks and artillery equipment.

A photo was released by ISIS' media branch for the province of Salahuddin, showing Abu Hajar al-Britani in full military uniform before his attack.

But the threats have not stopped jihadis defecting to other militant groups or fleeing the battlefield before carrying out their attacks
