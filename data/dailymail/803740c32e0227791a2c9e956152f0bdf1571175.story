Can't stay away: Paul Willard, 36, was arrested on Friday after he was found sleeping in the home of a woman he was accused of kidnapping last October 

Authorities say an Upstate New York man was arrested last weekend after he was found sleeping in the home of a woman he's accused of kidnapping last fall.

The Watertown Daily Times reports that state police charged 36-year-old Paul Willard of Edwards with criminal contempt for disobeying an order of protection last Friday.

Troopers say Willard was found sleeping in 43-year-old Kimberly L Peabody's home in the St. Lawrence County town of Russell just before 11:30am on Friday. 

St. Lawrence County sheriff's deputies arrested Willard last October after they say he violated a protection order and kidnapped Ms Peabody. 

Reports at the time stated that Willard woke Peabody up by shoving her with the barrell of a rifle and then forced her to get into his pick-up truck.

He then drove off with her to his home, where authoritites later found the two and arrested Willard.

Willard was released from jail at the end of November, and at a chearing in December, pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree burglary, second-degree kidnapping and first-degree criminal contempt.

Records show is booked in the St Lawrence County jail.  It couldn't be determined if he had a lawyer.
