Jersey Shore star Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi has said that she will let her son use tanning beds when he becomes a teenager, despite UV exposure being linked to skin cancer.

The heavily bronzed reality star, 25, who gave birth to baby Lorenzo in August,  told xojane that she wouldn't let him tan everyday 'but if you go once in a while, I don’t see the harm in that.'

She previously slammed Tanning Mom Patricia Krentcil for taking her five-year-old daughter into a tanning booth.

In pursuit of that mahogany glow: Reality TV star Snooki Nicole Polizzi has said that she will let her son Lorenzo visit tanning booths when he becomes a teenager

'That b***h is crazy... you are not supposed to take kids there.

'Everyone knows you are NOT supposed to take kids there,' she told  Extra host Mario Lopez last May.

he World Health Organization added ultraviolet (UV) radiation-emitting tanning devices - tanning beds and lamps - to the list of the most dangerous forms of cancer-causing radiation.

Its researchers found young people who use sunbeds are 75per cent more likely to develop malignant melanoma.

In the US, where the lifetime risk of developing invasive melanoma has risen to 1 in 5,  30 million Americans visit indoor tanning salons annually, fueling a $5 billion dollar a year industry.

Despite recent efforts to educate the public and limit young peoples’ access to indoor tanning facilities, sunbathing and indoor tanning have not significantly decreased.

Despite having naturally dark skin Snooki is a keen advocate of tanning.

Before becoming a mother she devoted 
much of her time to GTL - gym, tanning, laundry - and even got paid 
$11,000 to party at a tanning salon in New Jersey.

However she did put her UV tanning obsession on hold while she was pregnant to protect her unborn son.

She
 tweeted a picture of herself looking paler than normal along with the 
caption: 'Whoa look at this non tan. #pregnantproblems!'

And this month she launched her own range of tanning lotions as a safe alternative to sunbathing.

The World Health Organization  found young people who use sunbeds are 75per cent more likely to develop malignant melanoma.

Around 30 states in the U.S. have 
imposed age restrictions on indoor tanning and Vermont and California 
ban anyone under age 18 from using a sunbed.

During her xojane interview Snooki also revealed that she will get a boob job after she has had three more children.

'Everyone’s telling me to get them done 
after I have my kids. So I’m going to pop ‘em out and then get a boob 
job,' she explained.

She said that she has wanted a boob job since she was ten years old and would like to get breasts like her JWoww co-star Jenni 'JWoww' Farley.

'I love Jenni’s boobs, and I want boobs like that. And I think 
Jionni [her fiance] does too.'

Describing her style evolution since becoming a reality TV star in 2009 she added: 'Trashy, cheap, tacky, and now I’m classy-tacky.'
