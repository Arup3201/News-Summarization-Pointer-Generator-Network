Heroic: Inspector Bill Elliott was shot dead while investigating a bank robbery in Belfast in 1974. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal after his death

A murder investigation has been re-launched into the death of a police officer shot in a bank raid in Northern Ireland nearly 40 years ago.

Inspector Bill Elliott was driving on his own when he heard news that a robbery was under way at the Ulster Bank in Belfast in September 1974.

The 48-year-old, who was married with a son, raced to the scene and died after a shoot-out with republicans from the Official IRA who detectives said were armed with two submachine guns and a pistol.

Inspector Elliott was posthumously awarded the Queen's Police Medal.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) Serious Crime Branch revealed it has now reopened the case after a review of the killing by the police Historical Enquiries Team (HET) found potential new leads.

The HET is re-examining killings from the Troubles, and in many cases provides bereaved families with reports on the murders, but it also alerts detectives to any new lines of investigation.

Detective Superintendent Jonathan Roberts said: 'Certainly there are new lines of inquiry opening up to us and developing. It's an overall reassessment of the case.'

Clue: Police have released this picture of the getaway car used in the robbery, but say they no longer have the vehicle

As a Catholic schoolboy, Ronan Bennett, right, was convicted with two other teenagers of murdering Inspector Bill Elliott during the Ulster Bank robbery in 1974.

However, the conviction was quashed on appeal a year later after the story of a witness change a number of times.

Afterwards, Bennett was said to have shown a sympathy towards the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), which killed Airey Neave, Margaret Thatcher's Northern Ireland advisor, in 1979.

He later moved to London, where he was arrested in 1978 on spurious charges of conspiracy to cause explosions.

Police found a copy of the Anarchist's Cookbook in his flat, a text containing instructions on how to manufacture explosives.

He spent 16 months on remand, but was released after successfully defending himself.

Afterwards, he retreated into academia, gaining a first-class honours degree in History at King's College London and went on to complete a PhD there in 1987.

Bennett has published several novels, most notably The Catastrophist, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Novel Award.

It is the story of a doomed love affair between novelist James Gillespie and a fiery idealistic journalist, In√®s, set in the Belgian Congo just before independence.

He also wrote the screenplay of The Hamburg Cell, a film about the 9/11 hijackers.

He lives in London and is married to guardian.co.uk editor Georgina Henry.

He added: 'I don't wish to discuss 
specific new lines of inquiry because they are active lines of inquiry 
and to disclose them prematurely might compromise the case.'

Two teenagers were jailed in the aftermath of the robbery at the Diamond shopping centre in the Rathcoole area of the city.

But the original investigation became 
the focus of controversy when 18-year-old student Ronan Bennett - who is
now a high profile author and screenwriter - was convicted in 
connection with the killing, despite maintaining his innocence.

He has recounted that the evidence 
against him, that of a witness who gave a description of one of the 
gang, changed a number of times.

His conviction was quickly quashed by the Northern Ireland Appeal Court, which cleared his name within a year of the trial.

The senior officer now reopening the hunt
for Inspector Elliott's killers said it was possible to solve the case,
despite the passage of time.

DS Roberts added: 'We are in possession of witness statements that were taken at the time and we have a number of lines of inquiry to follow in respect of people who we believe may be able to give us information.

'We are well aware of what exhibits were taken at the time and what we are in possession of. I am very hopeful that there will be new opportunities identified.'

Investigators said that Inspector Elliott was driving his own car at the time of the robbery.

But officers believe he may have been travelling between stations when he heard news of the bank raid on his police radio.

DS Roberts said: 'It was a very gallant act, given that he was on his own, he was in his own car, he responded immediately and engaged in exchange of gunshots with three or more suspects.'

The police have released pictures of the scene of the bank shooting, as well as of the gang's getaway car, though investigators said they no longer have the vehicle.

Detectives have asked anyone with information to call 02890 700303.
