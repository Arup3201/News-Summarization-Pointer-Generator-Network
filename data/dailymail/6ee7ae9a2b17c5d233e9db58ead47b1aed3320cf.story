It seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the Go Compare TV commercials – any attempt to do away with him.

Two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year.

The Italian character, Gio Compario, created by Welsh singer Wynne Evans, was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle.

An ad showing Go Compare's opera-singing character Gio Compario being kicked in the stomach by Stuart Pearce generated over 1,000 complaints

Unsurprisingly, the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our TV screens.

However, it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with.

The first commercial featured former England left back, Stuart Pearce, who is famous for his hefty left foot, aiming a football at the annoying Gio.

More than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children.

The ASA disagreed, insisting most people would understand it was light-hearted and comical.

The second commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off.

This time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence.

Again the ASA backed the company, saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke, while Gio was unharmed.

The two commercials feature at the 
top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in
the watchdog’s annual report published today.

In
third place was a more serious advertisement by Channel 4 for its 
controversial series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which was deemed to have
sexualised a teenage girl.

The poster showed the 15-year-old 
blonde, who was heavily made up, spilling out of a low cut top that 
revealed her breasts and cleavage.

The
broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10-year-old 
boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped 
youngsters from the traveller community.

The watchdog’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year.

Among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a TV ad for Richmond ham, which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children.

Asda came under fire last Christmas for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman’s work.

Women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men, including Fathers for Justice, were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads.

However, the ASA sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising Christmas.

The organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the YouTube channel of the Paddy Power betting firm, which poked fun at transsexuals.

It could not make a ruling as the firm is based in Ireland, however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on British TV.

Surprisingly, the St John’s Ambulance was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year. Its TV ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis, treatment and eventual recovery from cancer, only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food.

More than 144 complained, however the ASA ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy.

Other commercials in the top ten, included a Morrisons ad where a dog was apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which might be harmful, and a Kellogg’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake.

The ASA partly upheld complaints about a TV ad for the Kayak Software Corporation which showed a man receiving brain surgery. Some viewers thought the theme was distressing.

The watchdog’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year. Its chairman, Lord Smith, the former Labour Culture Secretary, said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers aren’t being misled, misinformed, harmed or offended.

‘They need to be able to make proper, informed choices about what products and services are available to them. And we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers, so that responsible marketing isn’t being under-cut by the irresponsible.’
