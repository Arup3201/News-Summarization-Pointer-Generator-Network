Size 16 model Jennie Runk made waves last month posing for H&M's summer swimwear campaign.

The 5.10" brunette was hired by the high street brand to show off the range of larger sizes that their beachwear collections come in (U.S. sizes 14-24) and the shots caused a stir because there was no obvious reference to the fabulous looking model's size anywhere on the ads.

The collection was 
simply presented to customers as 'this season's new swimwear'. The only 
clue alluding to the line's larger sizing was a small '+' sign sitting to the right of H&M's logo.

Jennie has been modelling full time since 2011, after gaining 20lbs on the advice of a scout who spotted her volunteering at her local pet store as a teenager. She is now using her new found fame as an opportunity to promote positive body confidence in young women.

Size 16 model Jennie Runk made waves in the recent H&M campaign and is now using her fame to promote body confidence in young girls

Jennie has been modelling full time since 2011, when she gained 20lbs on the advice of a scout

She told theÂ BBC: 'I was given the option to lose weight and try to maintain a size four
 (a UK six or eight), or to gain a little - maintain a size 10 (a UK 12 
or 14) - and start a career as a plus-size model. I knew my body was 
never meant to be a size four, so I went with plus.

'People assume "plus" equates to fat, which in turn equates to ugly. This
 is completely absurd.'

The 24-year-old from Missouri, has 
received thank you messages from lots of new fans since appearing in the H&M campaign who say that her confidence 
has inspired them to try on a bikini for the first time in years.

She said: 'I found it strange that people made 
such a fuss about how my body looks in a bikini, since I don't usually 
give it much thought but this is exactly the kind of 
thing I've always wanted to accomplish, showing women that it's OK to be
 confident even if you're not the popular notion of "perfect".

'This 
message is especially important for teenage girls. Being a teenage girl 
is incredibly difficult. They need all the help and support they can 
get.'

The H&M campaign didn't make any reference to Jennie's size and she says that it's time we all stop obsessing about body shape

Jennie is on the books of the prestigious Ford Models agency in New York

Now on the books of New York's prestigious Ford Models Jennie admits
 that she found her teenage years difficult.

She was 5ft 9in and a size 
12 by the time she was 13 and envied the smaller girls at school. Her 
thick, curly hair, braces and wire-rimmed glasses drew more unwanted 
attention and she now wants to show young women that it is acceptable to
 be different and that they will grow out of that awful awkwardness.

She says: 'Just focus on being the 
best possible version of yourself and quit worrying about your thighs, 
there's nothing wrong with them. There's no need to glamorise one body 
type and slam another.

'We need to stop this absurd hatred towards bodies
 for being different sizes. It doesn't help anyone and it's getting 
old.'

Her Facebook page gained 2,000 new 'likes'  in 24 hours once the campaign launched (she now has over 3000 likes on the social networking site)

Following her appearance in the H&M adverts  Jezebel's Jenna Sauers praised the brand's choice of model, writing that she hoped it is a step 
towards viewing normal-sized models as matter of course, rather than 
continuing to see them pigeonholed into 'plus-size' classifications.

She said: 'I
 think it sends a positive message about inclusivity and changing 
standards of beauty.

'Seeing plus-size bodies in fashion spreads and ads should be as common as seeing anything else.'

Cuistomers too praised the mega retailer, with some writing 'thank you' notes to H&M's marketing department.

One woman posted an open letter to 
H&M in Jezebel's comments section, writing: 'Thank you so much for 
using Jennie Runk as your beachwear page covergirl. That you did so 
without calling attention to her shape makes it all the more 
commendable.

'I love seeing a girl with my body type not only represented on your website but represented without fanfare.'
