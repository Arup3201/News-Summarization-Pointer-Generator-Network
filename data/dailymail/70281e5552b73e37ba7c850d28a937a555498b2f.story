One-legged pensioner George Halliday defiantly insisted he will not be a prisoner in his home after allegedly being mugged on his mobility scooter.

A couple have been charged with robbing the 71-year-old.

Mr Halliday was left with stitches in his gums, cuts to his lip, a bloody head and a bruised side in the alleged attack.

George Halliday insists that he will not be frightened into staying in his house despite the alleged attack

The pensioner claimed he required hospital treatment following the incident near his home in Newcastle on Sunday evening

The 71-year-old had his right leg amputated 50 years ago after he developed gangrene

However, the father-of-four said he would not be frightened into staying indoors following the alleged incident.

He said: 'I'm tougher than that.

Mr Halliday, from Sheildfield, Newcastle said: 'I've been through so much in my lifetime.'

Mr Halliday admitted he has had a hard life and hasn't been able to work much since losing his leg

The attack is alleged to have happened on Sunday evening.

It is claimed Mr Halliday was pulled from his mobility scooter and punched before he had his cash stolen, along with his mobile phone and prescription medication.

He said: 'I had to have stitches in my gum.

'I hit my head off the floor and injured it, I fell on my side and it's sore. My lip was cut outside and inside. When they ran off I scrambled back up on to my scooter and someone rang an ambulance and I was taken to hospital.

'I was there for about four or five hours. It was horrible.'

Mr Halliday was taken to North Tyneside General with facial injuries following the incident.

Almost 50 years ago Mr Halliday had his right leg amputated from the thigh after suffering gangrene.

He added: 'I was in my 20s and my foot was black.

'I went to the hospital and they took one look at it and got me straight in to amputate. They took it straight off, it was that bad.

'I've never really worked since then.'

Mr Halliday said he had his cash taken in the incident.

He said: 'I had it in my pocket, not in a wallet or anything, but I had tenners and fivers. It was taken along with my phone. I was in a bad way and was just left on the floor.'

Simon Colclough, 38, and Deborah Archer, 34, both of Bewick Court in Newcastle city centre, both appeared before North Shields Magistrates' Court on Tuesday charged with robbery.

Neither entered a plea. But magistrates refused bail applications and the couple were remanded incustody.

It is expected they will appear at the Newcastle Crown Court next month.

Mr Halliday said he spent a 'horrible' four our five hours in hospital
