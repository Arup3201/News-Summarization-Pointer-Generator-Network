An Australian stonemason was left stunned when a lightning bolt destroyed his tribute to an iconic ancient Greek sculpture - and left only the statue's breasts intact.

Tom Finlay, 48, was standing just yards from his voluptuous hand-carved Venus de Milo sculpture in the yard of his business near Yarrawonga in the remote Northern Territory of Australia when there was a flash of white light and an 'almighty kaboom'.

Locally sourced porcenalite was scattered everywhere and the statue had been destroyed as it was struck by lightning.

Bolt from the blue: Mr Finlay describes how there was a blinding light and an 'almighty kaboom' when the lightning bolt struck Venus

But Mr Finlay was amazed, when he found that Venus' 30 kg breasts had survived the freak strike, the Northern Territory News reported. Â 

He said: 'There was a clap of thunder and the sculpture blew up like a rocket-launcher had hit it.

'The lightning looked like a serpent.

'Everything disintegrated but the breasts - all that's left is what's under her hips,' he added.

The 1.5m high sculpture, made of local porcelanite, had been proudly perched on a 6m steel reinforced column before the strike.

Shattered stone was strewn about the small courtyard at Finlay's Stonemasonry, where the top half of the headless Venus was obliterated on Friday afternoon.

Force of nature: Mr Finlay says that he does not know whether the lightning strike was a message from a higher power

Destroyed: Tom Finlay had sculpted the statue ten years ago as a tribute to Northern Territory women

He had made the sculpture - based on Alexandros' ancient Greek statue Venus de Milo - as a tribute to Northern Territory women ten years ago.

The statue was his first attempt at sculpting a human form.

Despite the eight meter drop onto the stone mural below, Venus' breasts survived intact, with just one nipple slightly damaged.

Mr Finlay said that he's not sure what he plans to do with the remainder of the statue and may hang it on the wall of his office.

He added that he is not sure whether the bolt was a message from a higher power.

He will leave the shattered stone scattered around the statue's base for now to show the 'force of nature'.

Unscathed: The 30kg breasts survived the lightning strike and subsequent fall almost entirely unscathed apart from damage to one of the nipples

Remains: Only a small part of the statue below the hips remains on top of the plinth

Replica: Tom Finlay's statue was a tribute to the iconic Venus de Milo statue
