A man shot dead by police during a dispute about a car was reportedly deaf and couldn't understand instructions from the officer who then killed him.

Edward Miller, 52, was gunned down by Joel Hernandez, a deputy sheriff in Volusia County, Florida, as he reportedly sat in his SUV at a towing yard in Daytona Beach on Saturday.

And now his grieving 25-year-old son, also called Edward, has said that his father has suffered severe hearing problems since he was a child.

Killing: Miller was reportedly in the grey SUV pictured above when he was gunned down 

He said that his father was shot six times in succession after Hernandez, who overheard a loud argument and came to investigate, spotted that he had a gun.

Describing the shooting to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, he said: 'I kept telling them that he can’t hear them... I was right there. I saw the whole thing.'

The incident was the second time the Millers had visited the towing yard to try to recover a vehicle, having come the previous day and also argued with store staff.

Dispute: Mr Miller was arguing with staff at Fryer's Towing Service when Hernandez made his fatal intervention

Miller's son had a gun on the Friday, which caused employees at Fryer's Towing Service to call police. But when they arrived they realized that he was carrying his gun lawfully and left.

A spokesman for the Sheriff's Office confirmed the killing, but did not provide details of the incident, which is currently under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

He said: 'While the specific sequence of events isn’t being released at this time due to the ongoing investigation, during the encounter, Hernandez perceived a threat and fired his duty weapon, striking and killing the man.'
