A pleasant Sunday afternoon walk along a crowded Florida beach turned into a nightmare for one family when a light aircraft made an emergency landing and killed a father and critically injured his daughter.

Sgt. Ommy Irizarry, 36, who was vacationing in the Sunshine State from neighboring Georgia with his wife and three children, was struck when a 1972 Piper Cherokee aircraft touched down on Caspersen Beach and died at the scene.

His nine-year-old daughter, Oceana, was critically injured and was been taken by helicopter to All Children's Hospital for emergency treatment.

Another woman who witnessed the incident suffered a heart attack and is currently being treated at Venice Regional Hospital.

It is unclear how quickly the plane came down and why Irizarry and his daughter were not able to get out of the way of the crashing aircraft in time.

Fatal crash: The 1972 Piper Cherokee made an emergency landing on Caspersen Beach in Venice

The plane's pilot, Karl Kokomoor, 57, of Englewood, Florida and his passenger David Theen, 60, were not injured.

New photos and video footage from the beach showed the Piper Cherokee, its nose pointed down and nearly touching white sands only feet from what appeared to be a gentle lapping surf.

The left wing appeared to extend slightly over the water's edge. A police boat was anchored nearby and a law enforcement officer stood beside the aircraft.

Bystanders gawked from a distance.

Sarasota Sheriff's spokesperson, Wendy Rose, said that the plane issued a distress signal at 2.45pm and informed Venice Airport the craft could not make it back to the airport.

The pilot told the tower he was going to try to land on the beach.

According to local reports the plane careened into the sea and the NTSB is heading to the scene to begin an investigation.

'One man is deceased, and a young girl, possibly around the age of 10 is very critically injured,' Sarasota County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Wendy Rose told ABC News.

The pilot and the passenger in the plane were not injured when the aircraft landed.

'The pilot radioed that he was not going to be able to make it back to the airport, and he was going to try to land on the hard-packed sand of the beach,' Rose told ABC News.

A father was killed and his daughter seriously injured while walking 
along a Florida beach when a small plane crash landed Sunday on the Gulf
 Coast only feet from the surf, authorities said.

Runway: The pilot indicated to air traffic controllers that he was going to use the hard sand bank on Caspersen Beach as a runway to land

'He landed about the water's edge and the pilot and his male passenger were both unharmed.'

Rose said that there may not have been enough time for the father and daughter to get out the way.

'I do know the timing of his radio to the Venice Airport and immediate response was minutes so there was not, from what I understand, there was not a lot of time between his radio dispatch and the crash,' she said to ABC News.

However, Venice Beach Mayor John Holic, himself a former air traffic controller, told ABC News that he believes the plane lost power mid-flight.

'One of the first things that you learn when you're flying is to always be aware of your surroundings and where you may be able to touch down in the event of loss of power. A beach is a viable place,' he told ABC News.

Investigation: Officials from the NTSB are arriving soon to the beach to try to understand how the aircraft came down so suddenly

Photos and video footage taken at the scene showed the Piper Cherokee, its nose pointed down and nearly touching white sans only feet from a gentle lapping surf. The left wing appeared to extend over the water's edge.

A police boat was anchored nearby and a law enforcement officer stood close by. Bystanders gawked from a distance.

Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, told The Associated Press in an email that the FAA was investigating.

She said the plane reportedly lost power and landed on the sand near Caspersen Beach in Venice but she had no further details as of Sunday evening.

National Transportation and Safety Board investigators have headed to the site.

'We don't know exactly what caused the crash but the NTSB is en route and will investigate,' added Rose, a community affairs manager for the sheriff's office.
