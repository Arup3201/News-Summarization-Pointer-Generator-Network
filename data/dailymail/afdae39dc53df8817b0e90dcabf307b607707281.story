Tony Bellew just cannot believe he is here. Not perched on the ring apron in a Rotherham gym, drenched in sweat with just a motorway hotel to look forward to after a 90-minute training session.

But here he is, preparing to fight in front of a sell-out crowd at Liverpool’s Echo Arena in Saturday’s rematch with Nathan Cleverly at cruiserweight in one of the most eagerly-awaited bouts of the year.

‘I was never meant to get this far,’ says Bellew. ‘This wasn’t a life that I could have envisaged when I was younger. I was the fat kid who was going nowhere. I had teachers who told me I wasn’t going to do anything with my life.

‘Before I put an England vest on and boxed for my country, people said I had no chance of doing it. I was always doubted.

‘I remember my own mother saying, “Son, give up this boxing game. You’re not the kind of person who does it”.

‘When your own mother doesn’t think you should box, it doesn’t look good. No mother wants to see their son punched in the face but I’ve got a dad who loves me just as much and he always believed I would be world champion.

Bellew has chance for revenge after Cleverly claimed a controversial majority points victory in 2011

Cleverly retained his WBO light-heavyweight  title by beating Bellew three years ago

‘I am driven. Nothing is ever enough. I could win £100million on the lottery and it wouldn’t be enough. If I make these next few fights work for me, it could be massive.’

Bellew, 31, feels boxing found him, rather than the other way around. Born and raised in Liverpool, he identified with Mike Tyson and Nigel Benn but dreamed of pulling on Everton’s No 9 shirt rather than lacing up the gloves.

‘I played around with boxing at 15 or 16,’ he says. ‘I didn’t take it seriously. I still had dreams of playing for Everton but I was too fat.

Bellew says he loves boxing and identifies with the likes of Mike Tyson and Nigel Benn

‘I was always fascinated with Mike Tyson and Nigel Benn, people who came from backgrounds like I did.

‘I’m from an unforgiving neighbourhood but it’s great. I grew up with loving people. I’ve got the same friends I had when I was 10. Some would say it’s a dump but to me, it’s a palace.’

By his late teens, Bellew was taking two buses across the city to reach the Rotunda gym where, by night, he was moulded into a three-time national amateur champion. By day, Bellew was finding his feet in the world of work.

Bellew remains adamant he has the measure of Cleverly, who is almost five years his junior at 27

‘I’ve been a labourer, I’ve worked security, I’ve worked the door at nightclubs, been a lifeguard, worked in retail. I even worked in a pillow factory,’ he recalls. ‘Getting £150 a week to stuff pillows makes you appreciate the good things.

‘I worked from seven till four and then it was straight to the gym. I won my first title during the 12 months I was there and that made me realise how hard I had to work to go further.’

After fewer than 50 amateur fights, Bellew turned professional. Sixteen victories later he was thrust into a fight with then world champion Cleverly.

Bellew says his hatred for Cleverly stems from the Welshman telling him in the ring that it had been his toughest fight but later, in front of the press, claiming he had sailed through in second gear.

Cleverly, 27, says Bellew is bitter and jealous of his success.

‘There is nothing in his career I could possibly want,’ counters Bellew. ‘I tried to win a world title at light-heavyweight and I fought the best in the division. If I die tomorrow, I’d die a happy man.

Bellew turned up the heat on Cleverly by branding the Welshman 'a fraud'

‘We’re from completely different environments. I was working nightclub security when he was in school. He doesn’t love boxing because he doesn’t know anything about boxing. I probably know more about his career than he does. I’ve studied boxing since I was a kid. He boxes for a living, I do it because I love it. I’d do it for free.

‘He (Cleverly) has this thing about being world champion, but was he really? It was a joke that our fight was for a world title. He came up against me after 16 fights; I’m a completely different fighter now.

‘The one thing we do have in common is that we come to fight but I just have more evil intentions, I’m a different breed.’

Throughout his career, Bellew has made almost as many headlines out of the ring as in it. Last year, his claim that he was ‘willing to die in the ring’ sparked outrage.

He is unrepentant. ‘It’s like saying you know the risks when you get on a plane,’ he says. ‘There’s a 99 per cent chance it won’t happen but it could. Getting in the ring is 100 times as bad. I’m not saying I want to die. I’m saying I’d rather die than quit.

‘That’s why I’m different. It would kill me to quit. I don’t glorify it, it’s the horrible side of boxing. Leaving my kids is what frightens me more than anything but it’s the only way I can provide a living for them.

Bellew is ready to fight in front of a sell-out crowd at Liverpool’s Echo Arena on Saturday

‘I’ve come out of fights and (been) p****** blood...my face black and blue and both hands broken.

‘I’ve been in brutal fights. I’ve dragged myself off the floor. I can say I’m willing to die in the ring because that’s what I’m about.

‘I’m too honest for my own good. I’m just telling them what I think. Sometimes that is bad, sometimes it’s good. Sometimes I let people in too much but that’s just me.

‘Do I want to kill anyone? Of course not. It’s a brutal sport but I don’t get paid to kill anyone. I get paid to knock someone out for 10 seconds. That’s what I’m trying to do but if you push the buttons you will get a reaction.

‘I’m a good person and I want to represent the sport I love in a good light. I’ve not done anything to be proud of yet but I’ll get there soon enough.’
