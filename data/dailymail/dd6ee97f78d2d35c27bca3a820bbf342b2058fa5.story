Weathermen have issued warnings of heavy rain this weekend after two motorists were killed in storms that brought havoc to the country.

Gales lashed southern England early yesterday, finally blowing away the Indian summer.

The winds later eased, but the Met Office said there was likely to be significant rainfall today and tomorrow.

Grey days ahead: Storms are set to lash the country as clouds and heavy rain are forecast all weekend

Dramatic: The south east of England is expected to see persistent rain and wind over the weekend. Pictured is sunrise behind The Shard as seen from the London Eye

A bit wet: City workers in London got wet at lunchtime today as the rain fell on the capital, although these shoppers (right) had the right idea by keeping dry under their umbrellas. The South East is expected to be hit with rain throughout the weekend

Calm setting: The sun appears over the horizon at Wembury beach in Devon this morning

Serene: Swansea escaped the torrents of rain, here a woman enjoys a peaceful walk with her dog on the beach at Langland Bay this evening

Downpours in London and Kent, 
beginning yesterday afternoon and continuing overnight, were expected to
produce up to 50mm of rain in places – almost half the monthly rainfall
figure of last October.

A 
Met Office spokesman said: ‘There will be really heavy downpours and 
they will produce a lot of rain in quite a short period of time.

‘Conditions
for driving could be difficult because of the amount of surface water.’
After a period of warm and calm weather, the country was initially 
blasted by gales on Thursday.

Wind
speeds at Great Dun Fell in the Pennines gusted up to 66mph and at 
Donna Nook, on the Lincolnshire coast, winds peaked at 59mph. The South 
suffered severe disruption early yesterday. A motorist died on the A350 
near Trowbridge, Wiltshire, in a collision with a lorry at 6.20am.

The
man, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene and the 
road was closed. The accident happened as heavy rain and strong winds 
battered the area.

A second road tragedy happened in Bournemouth when a 
man driving a Jeep spun off the A35 and crashed into a wall at around 
6am. The road was closed for several hours.

Many roads were affected by fallen 
debris. In Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, scaffolding covering a former HSBC 
bank collapsed in high winds. The scaffolding fell on to a neighbouring 
empty bank but no one was hurt.

There were also delays of up to one 
hour on DFDS Seaways’ cross-Channel ferries between Dover and Calais 
because of the poor conditions.

And if you needed any more evidence 
that the summer was well and truly over, bumper crops of Halloween 
pumpkins have been springing up throughout the country.

Harvest: This year's crop of pumpkins is expected to be the biggest on record due to the hot weather over the summer

Colourful: With freezing cold arctic weather and grey skies about to hit Britain, one small patch of rural Oxfordshire has exploded into colour

Divide: Forecasters have said the country will see a North-South split throughout the weekend, with the worst of the weather hitting the South East in particular

This year's crop is expected to be the biggest on record due to hot weather over the summer.

Philip
Gilbert, owner Quarry Nurseries, near Bandury, Oxfordshire, is getting 
ready to harvest his first crop of autumn vegetables.

Mr
Gilbert, 48, said: 'I will expect to sell around 400 pumpkins this 
autumn, the market is pretty saturated now so a lot of those go to 
wholesalers.

'As for 
the flowers, it's so lovely to still have them at this time of year, 
they are all getting to the end now so if we get a frost they will be 
gone. I've got a really good area to work with.

'I
start my pumpkins off during mid-May. The seed is sown individually 
into 3.5inch pots undercover. They are then grown on before hardening 
off. By early to mid-June weather permitting (and in the meantime having
prepared the ground) I set the plants out in the field.

'By
late September with a little luck they will have produced a good crop 
of that essential Halloween decoration, the pumpkin, ready for people to
carve.'

Danger: Two people get a bit too close as 30ft waves batter Headland Pier, in Hartlepool, on Thursday

Close call: The two men try and run from the pier in Hartlepool after it is battered by the waves on Thursday

Soaking: But they still get drenched after the waves crash over the sides of the pier

The Met Office said the weekend was likely to be blustery and wet in places with a return to normal autumn temperatures.

The spokesman said: ‘It looks as though things are getting back to normal for the time of year. We don’t expect anything too extreme, but the T-shirts can be put away.’ The downturn in the weather has prompted bets on a white Christmas and gloomy predictions of a harsh winter. William Hill is offering odds of 25/1 that this winter will be the coldest on record.

Windswept: Strong winds whip up huge waves battering the coast at Seaburn near Sunderland, on Thursday as Britain experienced a 'short, sharp shock' of colder temperatures

Hard to see: Vehicles negotiate their way along the M25 in Brentwood Essex in perilously poor visibility

Blown over: An 80ft high Maple Tree lies in the road after it was felled by winds in Great Barr, Birmingham on Thursday
