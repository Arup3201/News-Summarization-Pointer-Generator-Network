She may be a Dame, have an Oscar, four Baftas, three Golden Globes, four Emmys and two Cannes film awards, but actress Helen Mirren still remembers being a 'fat, spotty girl' who dreamed of being a Hollywood star.

The actress, who plays Alfred Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville opposite Anthony Hopkins in the upcoming biopic, told Harpers Bazaar that her dreams were never small; she always knew she wanted to make it into the big league.

She admitted: 'My inspiration was actually Eleonora Duse, Sarah Bernhardt, and those huge stars. if I am absolutely honest I just wanted to be a star - which is awful really.'

She continued: 'I also terribly wanted to be Brigitte Bardot. I was a fat, spotty girl sitting on the sea front in Southend-on-Sea imagining, dreaming, being absolutely sure that a big producer would drive by in a car with a cigar and lean out of the window and say "hey, what's your name? You're the one I’ve been looking for!".'

When she finally managed to break into the world of film, Mirren said she was more lost than ever before.

She said: 'Working on those movies I didn'’t know what the hell I was doing. On the first scene with Lindsay on O Lucky Man! I had to open this bottle of champagne, pour out a glass and "cheers!" and drink it.'

Having to drink real champagne through a number of cuts, Mirren said she was 'completely drunk after about half an hour'.

She recalled: 'I remember being walked around the gardens on this big house we were in and being plied with coffee, and them saying "are you all right?" and me going [slurs] "I think so...".  And then I went home in the car sobbing my eyes out, I thought I had completely blown it.'

The actress added that she is pleased to see film sets becoming a less masculine world: 'In my early career film sets were a very
masculine, laddish sort of atmosphere.

'And now - which is fantastic - 
there are women behind the camera, and I don't mean just as directors.

'When I did Arthur, there was a female camera crew. And now on every film
I've done since then there’s always a woman somewhere on the camera. 
Which is really great to see.'
