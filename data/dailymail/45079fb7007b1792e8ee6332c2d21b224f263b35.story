A popular restaurant has made the controversial decision to add a section to its credit card receipts that gives diners the option to leave a second tip for kitchen staff.

Zach Pollack, owner/chef at Alimento, a popular Italian eatery in Los Angeles, said he added the second gratuity after two of his cooks left for higher paying jobs.

'They couldn't make it work on their end, and I couldn't make it work on mine - this is a small restaurant,' he told Los Angeles Magazine. 'But at the same time, the servers are walking away with a lot of money. That's great, but it put an issue in the spotlight that I've been aware of for a while.'   

Would you leave a second tip? Alimento, an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles, has added a second line on its credit card receipts in hopes of retaining its kitchen staff 

The kitchen gratuity will be divided evenly between Alimento's line cooks, prep cooks and dishwashers. The sous chefs and Pollack himself will not get a cut. 

Traditionally, kitchen staff make a higher hourly wage than front-of-house staff - like bartenders and waitresses - to compensate for the fact they aren't making tips.

Still, the take-home pay doesn't even out: According to a study cited by Grubstreet, back-of-house workers make an average of $18,720 per year while the people in front make $24,123.

Mr Pollack says he hopes other eateries adopt his policy so that ultimately 'the best restaurants would be able to sustain better cooks, rather than losing them to hotels, country clubs, or lounge restaurants that are able to subsidize kitchen labor with extra income.'

Restaurant employees are divided about Pollack's plan.

Oliver Levius, a chef at Italian restaurant Pastai in Manhattan, told MailOnline he thinks the kitchen gratuity is 'a little tacky' and 'overly forward.'

'It also pits the servers against the kitchen team, and restaurants tend to work better if the whole joint is pulling together,' he said. 

Pastai's manager Charles Fenwick Elliott, who is a former waiter, offered another scenario: 'I've had bad tips before as a direct result of the kitchen screwing up. Conversely, great food can go unrewarded if the service is bad. So in my utopic restaurant scenario, I'd like to see tips split down the middle between servers and kitchen staff.'

Bob Wilkerson, who worked as a cook in high-end restaurants in Roanoke, Virginia, for more than 15 years, said Pollack's plan is something he always wished for. 

'There was nothing worse than working a 500 plate service and then hearing the servers brag about the money that they had made,' Mr Wilkerson said. 'Working a Friday night dinner rush is probably one of the most stressful things I have ever done. Having a few bucks tossed my way at the end of a shift like that would certainly make my day.

'Kitchen workers are the unsung heroes of the food industry, and they can make or break a restaurant's reputation. I don't think there needs to be an industry standard for what to tip the kitchen, but what is it to throw an extra dollar to the cooks? Those dollars would add up.' 

Although the industry may be divided, none of the potential patrons the Mail interviewed seemed perturbed by the suggestion to leave a second tip for kitchen staff.

'When a meal is really great, why would I not want to reward the kitchen?' said Amelia Mattix, a resident of Brooklyn, New York.. 'I'm in law school, so it's not like I'm exactly rolling in dough at the moment, but a few extra dollars for an awesome meal isn't going to keep me from paying rent.'

Chicago resident Jourdan Crouch agrees: 'If the restaurant is tiny - which it sounds like this place is - the owner probably can't afford to raise the hourly wage by much. If this is what I can do to support small businesses that I love, I'm happy to do it.

Plus, having a second tip section gives you the option to distinguish great food from great service. I won't punish the server for bad food, and I won't punish the kitchen for bad service.'  

Mr Pollack insists that the kitchen tip is completely optional - and he's reminding Alimento's diners of this by sending a tiny card out with the bill. 

'At Alimento, we believe a great meal comes together not from the effort of any single person, but from the successful cooperation of a team of people, from servers and hosts, to cooks and bussers. Nevertheless, traditional tipping has created a very sizeable gap between the earnings of cooks and servers, and current State law prohibits restaurants from sharing servers' tips with kitchen staff. Rather than imposing a mandatory 'service fee' or 'kitchen surcharge' as many are doing, we'd like to leave the choice in your, the diner's, hands. If you're perfectly happy with tipping as usual, there's no need for you to do anything differently. But, if you'd like to send a little love to the lads and ladies hustling in the back, we'd be honored to provide you the means to do so. All such tips will go to line cooks and other kitchen staff; no one in management will participate.L.A. has many great restaurants, and we're thrilled you've chosen to dine with us today. We will continue to work hard to bring you the best dining experience we possibly can.Thanks for your ongoing support!' 

This is not the first restaurant that has experimented with a different model for paying its employees.

Los Angeles restaurants Republique, Animal, Hungry Cat and others have added a 3per cent surcharge to bills to pay for employees' health insurance, according to the LA Times. 

And Michelin-star chef Daniel Patterson, who owns Coi in San Francisco, recently announced plans to do away with tips and service charges altogether at his new restaurant Aster. Instead, he will raise menu prices by 15per cent and pay all employees hourly.

'This way, price is all inclusive,' he told Eater. 'There's no healthy San Francisco surcharge. There's no tip, there's no service charge. There's just one price.

'I really do think in five years that's how every restaurant will run.'
