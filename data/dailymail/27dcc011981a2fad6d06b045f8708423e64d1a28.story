The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear a new challenge to President Barack Obama's health care law that would threaten federal subsidies that help millions of low- and middle-income people afford their health insurance premiums.

The justices said they will review a unanimous federal appeals court ruling that upheld Internal Revenue Service regulations that allow health-insurance tax credits under the Affordable Care Act for consumers in all 50 states, regardless of whether they signed up through their state exchanges or through the federal healthcare site. 

Opponents argue that federal subsidies are illegal because of the way health care reform legislation was worded. The bill specifically notes that subsidies are available 'through an exchange established by the state' - not by the federal government.

The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear a new challenge to the law that seeks to invalidate federal subsidies

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the congressional intent behind the law is for eligible customers regardless of where they live to receive assistance from the government to subsidize the purchase of health care. He promised a vigorous defense before the high court.

'We continue to have high confidence in the legal argument, both from a legal perspective and a common-sense perspective. This is a law that is working, that's why you'll see a vigorous defense here,' Earnest told reporters on Friday.

The long-running political and legal campaign to overturn or limit the 2010 health overhaul will be making its second appearance at the Supreme Court. The justices upheld the heart of the law in a 5-4 decision in 2012 in which Chief Justice John Roberts provided the decisive vote.

In the appeal accepted Friday, opponents of the subsidies argued that the court should resolve the issue now because it involves billions of dollars in public money.

'Today’s grant of cert by the Supreme Court is excellent news, regardless of which side of the issue you’re on,' Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a group funding the Obamacare challenge, said today in a statement. 'The need for a quick and final resolution of this question is undeniable.

'This "subsidies-for-everyone" rule affects nearly every person across the country—health insurance policyholders, workers and employers, taxpayers, and state and local governments,' he added.

The court rarely steps into a case when there is no disagreement among federal appellate courts, unless a law or regulation has been ruled invalid.

But at least four justices, needed to grant review, apparently agreed with the challengers that the issue is important enough to decide now.

Supporters of the health care law were flabbergasted and accused the court of verging into politics. The news came a week ahead of the second open enrollment season for subsidized private health insurance under the law.

'All of the general guidelines that the court traditionally uses in determining whether it should schedule an appeal are totally absent in this case,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group that supported Obama's health overhaul from its inception. Pollack called the court's action 'an unusual political act.'

The legal challenge to the subsidies is 'the most serious existential threat' facing the Affordable Care Act, added Pollack.

Maria Alvarado, 30, holds her 10-month-old son, Kevin Rios, as she waits in line at a health insurance enrollment event in Cudahy, California, in March. Because California has its own Obamacare exchange, the states residents are not immediately in danger of losing government subsides if the new Obamacare case succeeds

The health care law provides taxpayer-subsidized private health insurance for people who don't have access to coverage on the job. More than 4 out of 5 of the roughly 7 million people currently enrolled are getting help, which is keyed to household income and the cost of a benchmark plan.

When the court upheld the law in 2012, it still made a major change to Obama's signature legislation by ruling that its Medicaid expansion for low-income people was optional for states. So far 27 states and the District of Columbia have accepted it. This week's Republican election success makes it unlikely that the remaining 23 states will move any time soon.

The subsidies issue is being fought in several courts. In July, the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court upheld Internal Revenue Service regulations that allow health-insurance tax credits under the law for consumers in all 50 states.

On that same July day, a panel of appellate judges in the District of Columbia, sided with the challengers in striking down the IRS regulations. The Washington court held that under the law, financial aid can be provided only in states that have set up their own insurance markets, known as exchanges.

For those federal exchange consumers, the subsidies cover 76 percent of their premiums, on average. Customers now pay an average of $82 on total monthly premiums averaging $346. The federal subsidy of $264 a month makes up the difference.

But in October, the entire Washington appeals court voted to rehear the case and threw out the panel's ruling, eliminating the so-called circuit split. The appeals argument has been scheduled for December 17, but that case now recedes in importance with the Supreme Court's action to step in.

The case, King v. Burwell, probably will be argued the first week in March, with a decision expected by late June. 

News of the Supreme Court case broke just as President Obama was sitting down with congressional leaders, some of whom have threatened to repeal his signature law. 

If opponents of the law succeed in convincing the high court to rule in their favor, it could be easier for Republican leaders in Congress to get Democrats on board with reforms to the bill given that millions of Americans the law was intended to benefit will be shut out of receiving the government subsidies that make compliance with the individual mandate portion of the law financially feasible for them.

Conservatives hope the law will unravel entirely, allowing lawmakers to redo health care reform from scratch. 

Republican and Democratic lawmakers lined up on Friday to weigh in on the court's decision to review the subsidies clause in Obamacare. GOP legislators of course trumpeted their support for the high court's announcement while Democrats slammed the suit as an attack on the less fortunate.

'The Obama administration has been potentially doling out billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies without the proper statutory authority and I applaud the Supreme Court’s decision to review this case,' Tennessee Rep. Diane Black, a Republican, said in a statement.

Fellow Tennessee Rep. Scott Desjarlais, one of several doctors in Congress, said that the case 'presents the best chance of finally abolishing President Obama’s health care law' because it is 'beyond clear'  that its unconstitutional for the IRS, a government bureaucracy, to be 're-writing a major portion of the Affordable Care Act – an action reserved exclusively for Congress.'

'This goes beyond health care to the very heart of our nation’s democratic system of government,' Desjarlais said. 'I hope the justices will rule accordingly by striking down this unconstitutional power grab by the Obama administration.'

Likewise, House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa claimed that 'the sloppy and rushed nature of the process that created the health law is rightly catching up to it.'

'The statute provides no authority for subsidies through the federal exchange, and proponents of the law cannot cover-up their regrets by ignoring the plain text of the law when it proves inconvenient.'

Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Sander Levin, the ranking member on the House Ways and Means committee argued that the 'lawsuit misconstrues the intent of the authors of the Affordable Care Act.'

Pointing out the repercussions of the suit if the Supreme Court sides with conservatives, Levin said, 'Low- and middle-income Americans who live in states that chose not to establish their own marketplaces should not be penalized simply because their state decided to defer to the federal government.

'As the ranking member of one of the committees that shaped and debated the healthcare law, I am confident that the Supreme Court will recognize both the letter and intent of the law to ensure that financial assistance remains available in every state,' the Michigan representative said.

Only Americans enrolled in health care through the federal exchange would be affected, not those enrolled through their state exchanges

Law says that only Americans enrolled in state exchanges are eligible for government subsidies to help them afford health care insurance

Democrats say court should abide by intent of the law, which is for all eligible low- and middle-income Americans to receive aid

If the high court rules with opponents of the law, they hope Obamacare will unravel entirely, allowing Congress to redo health care reform from scratch
