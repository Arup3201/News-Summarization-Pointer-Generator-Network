Burger King has revealed the whopper 'hands-free' holder that allower customers to wear their burger around their neck is a hoax.

Last week rumours emerged that 50 of the strange utensils were being given away in Puerto Rico in celebration of the chain's 50th anniversary - they were showcased in an upbeat ad posted on You Tube.

The contraption wraps around the neck and positions the famously flame-grilled delight just below the consumer's mouth.

Serious? Burger King in Puerto Rico is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a giveaway of 50 hands-free Whopper holders and has produced a hilarious commercial to showcase the bizarre eating utensil

Focus: In each of the scenes, a character illustrates how they can perform other tasks while eating their coveted burgers

But today Burger King denied they were handing out the new product and insisted it was just a joke.

'The video featuring a ‘hands-free’ Whopper Sandwich holder was produced by an agency in Puerto Rico to celebrate the brand and the iconic Whopper Sandwich in a humorous way.

However, the product depicted in the spot was not produced, or distributed to guests as some reports indicate,' reads the short statement from Burger King to CNBC.

But the company said that it is true that the first Burger King in Puerto Rico opened in 1963 - so it  is the chain’s 50th anniversary in Puerto Rico.

To promote the Hands Free Whopper, the commercial, that has since been taken off the Burger King site, played a multitude of scenarios in which people multitask while eating their burgers.

At the beginning, a musician asks the audience in Spanish: 'In a world of multitasking, how can you use your hands to do your daily activities and eat a Whopper at the same time?'

Food for fight: The burger chain has taken the ad off its site but it still remains on You Tube where so far it has drawn 1,500 views

Smooth: The witty commercial begins by asking in Spanish 'in a world of multitasking, how can you use your hands to do your daily activities and eat a Whopper at the same time?'

Practice makes perfect: The seemingly ironic ad has drawn criticism from people disgusted at the idea that people could be so lazy that they wouldn't even hold their food

What follows is a witty selection of vignettes of characters performing tasks while eating the delicious fare.

In one, a tattoo artist works on a client while feasting on his burger.

In another, a sun-tanned young man massages a half naked woman on a beach while cheekily winking at the camera between bites.

Scenarios range from dancers to cops ticketing cars, cyclists and dog walkers, all of whom are able to multitask thanks to the ingenious Hands Free Whopper.

Picture of health: The device hangs around the back of the neck positioning the burger in a cup below the chin

Ta-da! Most of the scenarios feature men as the burger-eating protagonists

On duty: The repetitious lyrics outline all the things you can do with your hands if they're free and then thank the Hands Free Whopper at the end for making it all possible

Notably only one of the scenes features a woman using the equipment while she paints her nails.

Produced by Burger King, Viral Visuals TV are responsible for posting the ad on You Tube and inviting users to comment. 

The response has been overwhelmingly negative. Though some people ask the pressing question: What do you do when you've eaten the first half?
