Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is the subject of an FA investigation into alleged anti-Semitism.

The Italian striker re-posted an image to his Instagram account of the gaming character Super Mario which read: 'Don't be racist — be like Mario. He's an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.'

At the bottom the image included the words: '... jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew.' 

If Balotelli is charged by the FA he could face a five-match ban.

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli posted the image on Monday before swiftly deleting it

Balotelli has not been impressive  since arriving this summer, and is yet to score a Premier League goal

Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches and fined £80,000 by the FA in February of this year after making the controversial 'quenelle' gesture after scoring for West Brom against West Ham. The Frenchman denied that his 'inverted Nazi salute' was anti-Semitic. 

Balotelli then appeared to delete the image before denying he had made an offensive anti-Semitic reference. 'My Mom is jewish so all of u shut up please,' he said on Twittter.

A spokesperson for the FA was quoted in the Guardian saying the governing body was looking into the matter.

They can take action if they believe Balotelli has 'bought the game into disrepute by making comments which included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race'.

'We are aware of the posting which has since been promptly deleted by the player,' a Liverpool spokesman said. 'We will be speaking to the player about the issue.'

Balotelli had already deleted a photoshopped image of him being bitten in the arm by former Liverpool man Luis Suarez, in reference to the Uruguayan striker's ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini in the World Cup in June. 

Italian striker Balotelli soon posted a defence for the image, saying his mother is Jewish

Balotelli's mocked up picture, pretending to show Luis Suarez's biting his arm, was also deleted on Monday

The original picture was taken by a man wearing a USA shirt, and has been adapted by the Italian striker

Former FA executive and current chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, Simon Johnson, believes Balotelli should be investigated.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'We abhor all forms of racism, wherever it is found.

'We call upon the FA to investigate this offensive social media post and to take action if appropriate if we are to succeed in kicking racism out of football.'

Balotelli's post comes after Rio Ferdinand was fined £45,000 in 2012 for his 'choc ice' tweet aimed at Ashley Cole after he gave evidence at John Terry's racism trial.

And just last month, Wigan owner Dave Whelan was charged by the FA for making comments about Jewish and Chinese people after the Championship club appointed Malky Mackay as their new boss.

Mackay himself is under investigation by the FA for sending racist, sexist and homophobic messages while he was the manager of Cardiff City.

Whelan  told the Guardian he believed 'Jewish people chase money more than everybody else'.
