Arrested: Teen mom Violet Hinrichs, 19, was arrested last week after police caught her on hospital surveillance video abusing her 7-month-old son

A teen mom in Florida was arrested last week for chocking her 7-month-old baby to the point of seizures.

Staff at St Joseph's Children's Hospital in Tampa alerted police after they noticed bruising on the neck of an infant named Danny, being monitored for seizures and sleep apnea.

Police reviewed surveillance footage taken in the hospital and noticed several instances where Danny's 19-year-old mother Violet Hinrichs squeezed him so hard he passed out.

The Port Richey woman was arrested April 29 and charged with four counts of child abuse and is currently being held on $80,000 bond.

Authorities say the surveillance footage showed Hinrichs picking up Danny from his crib and squeezing him so hard he began to flail, turn blue and then become unresponsive.

Hinrichs brought Danny into the hospital about three weeks before her arrest, saying the boy was experiencing seizures and sleep apnea.

She appeared loving when she shared progress of the boy's treatment online with her Facebook friends.

'Wanted to update every one on Danny. He is being treated for seizures. In the past 24 hrs he had 6 with 2 lasting longer than 6 minutes...Please keep him in your prayers. If he does ok on these meds we will go home Sunday night,' she wrote on April 18.

Sick? Hinrichs' son Danny had been in the hospital for about three weeks before her arrest, under observation for sleep apnea and seizures. The 7-month old hasn't had a single seizure since being separated from Hinrichs. Pictured above in photos posted on Hinrichs' Facebook

Sympathy card: Hinrichs' sister says she has the mental capacity of an eight year old and may be suffering from Munchausen syndrome

But after her arrest last week, she copped to police that she was responsible for the baby's injuries.

Danny hasn't had a single seizure since being separated from his mother.

Hinrichs' sister Tiffany Coffey expressed shock over the abuse accusations and says her sister has always been good with the baby.

'I don't know why she would do this. I don't understand how any human could do that to a child,' Coffey told My Fox Tampa on Wednesday.

But she says her sister does have a learning disability, leaving her with the mental capacity of an eight year old.

Those who suffer from Munchausen syndrome make up illnesses to gain sympathy from others. Danny will be placed in foster care once released from the hospital

She believes her sister may be suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Munchausen syndrome is a psychiatric disorder where those affected make up illnesses to gain sympathy from others. 

After Danny is released from the hospital, he will be put in the protection of foster care.

Coffey says that Hinrichs had another child before Danny a few years ago, but the child was put up for adoption at birth because her sister was too young.

Hinrichs reportedly lives with her mother, and Pasco County child protective investigators have been called to the property before.
