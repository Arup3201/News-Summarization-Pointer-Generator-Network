David Beckham has had '723' inked on to his left hand to represent the shirt numbers he became famous for wearing during his time in football.

The 39-year-old was sometimes referred to as 'DB7' at the peak of his career as he wore the No 7 shirt for both Manchester United and England.

The former Three Lions captain, who retired in 2013 after a brief stint with Paris Saint-Germain, went on to wear the No 23 shirt during his time with Real Madrid and LA Galaxy.

Beckham, who likes the No 23 because of his admiration for former NBA superstar Michael Jordan, even went as far as requesting to wear the No 32 shirt at AC Milan and PSG in order to ensure the two digits were on his kit.

His latest tattoo adds to those he has had inked on to his body over the years - which include his kids' names, an image of his wife Victoria and a ring of roses to mark his 10th wedding anniversary to the former Spice Girl.

Beckham added to his extensive collection in September when he decided to get Jay Z’s lyrics ‘Dream Big Be Unrealistic’ tattooed across his right hand.
