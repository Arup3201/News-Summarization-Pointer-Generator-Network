An Irn-Bru advert showing a curvaceous mother discussing her cleavage with her horrified teenage son has been deemed acceptable by the advertising watchdog despite 176 complaints.

The television ad features buxom actress Marianne Adams, 43, in a tightly-fitting pink cardigan telling her son: 'New push-up bra. Amazing eh?' as his friends ogle her breasts.

But the son's shock and embarrassment faded as he sipped Irn-Bru and he responds: 'Looking good mum.'

His mother then gives him a big cuddle before suggesting a 'group hug' to which his friends agree enthusiastically.

See the advert below

Fury: The Irn-Bru advert starring Marianne Adams, 43, as a buxom mother has prompted more than 170 complaints from viewers 
 

Cheeky: The advert shows a mother in a tight-fitting pink cardigan who then tells her embarrassed son and his two delighted friends: 'New push-up bra. Amazing eh?'

Viewers complained the relationship between the mother and her teenage son's friends is inappropriate

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said many of the complaints believed the ad was offensive and irresponsible because they the scenario between the mother and the young men was 'sexual and inappropriate'.

But it has ruled that the advert was not irresponsible, sexist or demeaning and focused on the son's embarrassment rather than the mother trying to seduce her son's friends.

The ASA said: 'Although we noted that
some complainants had interpreted the action in the ads as portraying 
an inappropriate relationship between the mum and the son's friends, we 
did not consider that their interaction was a portrayal of irresponsible
behaviour.

'We considered that the action relied
on the mum being confident and attractive, but not consciously or 
overtly behaving in a sexualised or flirtatious way.

Eye-catching: The teenager's friends can be seen ogling his mother's breasts as she bends down to clean the table

Awkward: The teenager looks distinctively uncomfortable as his friends stare at his attractive mother

But his embarrassment is eased when he takes a sip of Irn-Bru - then telling his mother: 'Looking good, mum'

'We also considered 
that the focus of the ads was the son's embarrassment at the effect his 
mum's appearance was having on his friends.

'Therefore, and particularly in the 
context of ads intended to portray a surreal and light-hearted comedic 
approach, we did not consider that the action or depiction of the female
protagonist was sexist or demeaning and concluded that the ads were not
in breach of the code.'

The ASA ruled that no further action was necessary.

Others complained that the ad was sexist and demeaning to women, while some were concerned that it was inappropriately scheduled at a time when children could have been viewing.

Too close for comfort: But his relief is short-lived when his mother grabs him by the head for a tight cuddle

'Group hug': And when his mother suggests a big group hug, the teenagers friends are more than happy to oblige

Cleared: The ASA found that the advert was not irresponsible as it concentrated on the embarrassment of the son

Irn-Bru manufacturer AG Barr said it wanted the ad to 'stay true to the traditionally cheeky and irreverent sense of humour' of previous campaigns but not to 'objectify women, carry any tone of a sexual nature or cause offence'.

It said the focus of the ad was the son's embarrassment and the comedic concept that Irn-Bru would help him deal with such an awkward situation.

It added that the young men were not reacting in a way that portrayed sexuality or colluding in a salacious fashion, but were rather transfixed by the mother's appearance.
