The latest collection showcases several new designs, including ‘Odessha’, a cornflower-blue satin design with ivory lace detailing, and ‘Fern’, a chic black mesh range.  

It's been a year of celebrations for Melanie, who tied the knot with her toyboy lover Jack Cockings, 27, earlier this summer.

The star has previously opened up about how she maintains her incredible figure, telling MailOnline: 'On a good week if I'm not working I
get in the gym between three and five times a week, an hour a time.

'I
started training about four years ago. I was approaching 40 and just 
thought it would be quite good to get fit... I was slim, but it wasn't 
about that, it was about getting a bit fitter.'
