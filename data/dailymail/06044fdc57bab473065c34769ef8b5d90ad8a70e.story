Neil Warnock remains convinced Crystal Palace will not be dragged into a relegation dogfight despite a run of one win in 10 games.

The Palace boss admitted 'we could and should have won' the last five games in the wake of Saturday's dismal 1-1 draw with Stoke at Selhurst Park.

Palace's only win since September was a 3-1 triumph over Liverpool, but since then the south Londoners have drawn with Swansea, Tottenham and Stoke, and lost at home to Aston Villa.

The Eagles now sit just one point off the relegation zone, but Warnock is unfazed by his side's recent missed opportunities.

'I still think we've got enough to be okay,' said Warnock.

'I don't think you can write us off against anybody.

'That's five games where we could and should have won really.

'So we've just got to convert more of our opportunities.

'We have got to create chances, get two or three players in the transfer window as quickly as possible, and then take it forward.'

James McArthur claimed his first goal for Palace in 15 appearances since his switch from Wigan, but Peter Crouch struck almost immediately to level for Stoke.

Neither side could then carve out another clear opening in a dour contest between two teams struggling for fluency.

Marouane Chamakh led Palace's forward line against Stoke, linking play well but never offering a credible goal threat.

The Morocco striker picked up a thigh problem that could sideline him for several weeks, and Warnock has made no secret of his desire to sign a striker in January.

Palace have only mustered three goals in their last four games, but Warnock is unconcerned by his side's lack of finishing power.

The former Sheffield United boss is adamant Palace are still heading in the right direction, claiming he is satisfied with the Eagles' creativity.

'The problem is when you're not creating and you're not playing well,' said Warnock.

'You're really snookered then.

'But I feel we've got good balance, decent creativity and we've just not taken our opportunities.

'And we're coming across some good goalkeepers at the minute, so I've got no complaints from the lads at all.'
