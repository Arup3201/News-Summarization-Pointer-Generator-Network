A Soldier who volunteered for one final tour of duty in Afghanistan was among those killed by a rogue Afghan policeman, it was revealed yesterday.

Warrant Officer Class 2 Leonard ‘Pez’ Thomas, 44, had enjoyed a proud military career spanning more than two decades.

But driven by a desire to make a difference, he decided on one last deployment.

Tragically, the selfless soldier was shot dead alongside two comrades by an officer in the civil order police named as Ziarahman. He opened fire on the three mentors at a checkpoint in Helmand province following an argument.

The fallen servicemen were named last night as WO2 Thomas, from the Royal Corps of Signals, and Guardsman Craig Roderick, 22, and Guardsman Apete Tuisovurua, 28, of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards.

The men, members of an Afghan Police Advisory Team, had been helping organise a shura – or meeting of elders – at Checkpoint Kamparack Pul in Nahr-e-Saraj when they were killed on Sunday. A fourth British soldier was injured and is in a stable condition in hospital.

The killer, who is thought to have been armed with an AK47 assault rifle, was shot and captured alive. Initial reports said a row broke out when Ziarahman was challenged about taking bribes from Afghan civilians.

Seven British servicemen have now been murdered this year by rogue Afghans in ‘blue on green’ attacks – a quarter of UK fatalities in the country.

WO2 Thomas, from Cardiff, was a reservist on his final military tour having served since 1990 in units including the Coldstream and Welsh Guards in Iraq and Northern Ireland.

He leaves behind his mother Sylvia, long-term partner Rachel, and younger brother Tristan, 43. His family described him as ‘a military man through and through’.

Guardsman Roderick, 22, from Llanharan, South Wales, leaves behind his parents Mike and Sadie, two sisters and a  step-brother. Guardsman Tuisovurua, 28, from Fiji, joined the regiment in June 2011.

He leaves behind a mother, father, four brothers and three sisters. He was described as ‘one of nature’s true gentlemen’ by his commanding officer.
