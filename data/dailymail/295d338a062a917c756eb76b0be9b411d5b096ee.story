A truck driver has been charged over a dramatic multi-vehicle crash in Sydney that left six people injured

The 40-year-old Smithfield man will appear in court in January over the crash at Dee Why, North Sydney, on October 21. 

Police allege the truck lost control coming down a steep hill from Warringah Road toward Pittwater Road about 6am, crossing three northbound lanes and mounting a concrete median strip.

The truck then crossed over the median strip and ploughed into several cars that had stopped at a set of traffic lights.

A taxi driver who witnessed the crash told 2GB the truck had landed on top of three cars waiting at the traffic lights after hitting the median strip and crossing over into incoming traffic. 

'They were standing still at the lights, they had nowhere to move, and (the truck) has just gone straight over the top of them all,' the witness told the radio station.

The truck was carrying various items including flour, which exploded onto the road.  

NSW Police said emergency crews worked to free those trapped in the wreckage and there was fuel leaking from one of the vehicles.

All south-bound lanes were closed and motorists being advised to avoid the area as investigations continued.
