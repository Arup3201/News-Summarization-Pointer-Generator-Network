Veteran Gordon Hoggan, 55, wants to meet the family of the Argentine soldier he claims he killed with a bayonet during the Falklands War

A Falklands War veteran who wants to meet the family of an Argentine soldier he claims to have killed during the 1982 conflict was accused last night of fabricating his story.

Former guardsman Gordon Hoggan, 55, made international headlines last week after issuing an emotional appeal to come face-to-face with the relatives of Jose Luis Galarza – who he says he stabbed to death on Mount Tumbledown, near the islands’ capital, Port Stanley.

In a story published by The Guardian, the guardsman, who has suffered mental health issues since the campaign, said he wanted to achieve ‘closure’ and to explain his actions to the deceased soldier’s family.

But last night a senior British Army officer said Hoggan’s account was ‘completely untrue’.

Hoggan, who served with G Company, Scots Guards, gave an interview during which he described graphically bayonetting an Argentine soldier.

‘I stabbed him through the neck with my bayonet,’ he said.

‘He was screaming in Spanish. I had to put my foot on his face to get my bayonet out. The blood came rushing out. I was covered from head to foot.’

Hoggan said he was now trying to trace the victim’s family using details on his helmet, which he has kept ever since.

Hoggan, from Spondon, Derbyshire, added: ‘I’d like to return the helmet, for closure on my behalf. They may not want it. They’d probably hate me. But I would like to explain to them why it happened.’

Galarza was identified as the owner of the helmet by an Argentinian newspaper, which then tracked down members of his family, who apparently burst into tears. The story was subsequently published by The Guardian under the headline ‘British Falklands veteran to meet family of Argentinian soldier he killed.’

But Hoggan’s account has been challenged by several Falklands veterans, including a retired commander who led the Scots Guards on Mount Tumbledown.

The senior officer told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am afraid that this is completely untrue. The guardsmen of G Company did not see any enemy and therefore did not have bayonets fixed. For 200 yards around us there were no Argentinians.’

Told of the doubts about his account, Hoggan said: ‘They are wrong. Why would I lie about something like that? My company was the first to reach that position and there were no casualties. It was after the rest of the battalion moved up that we were left dealing with pockets of Argentinian soldiers. That is when it happened.’

Hoggan also claimed one of his colleagues from the battle, Kenneth Mains, witnessed his actions. But Mr Mains, who has now left the Army, said: ‘I was not with Hoggan and I never saw him that night or witnessed any such action.

‘Also, I don’t know of anyone in G Company who engaged the enemy. I would take what he’s saying with a pinch of salt. It’s a shame as everyone has their demons to deal with.’ 

The MoD and Foreign Office declined to comment.
