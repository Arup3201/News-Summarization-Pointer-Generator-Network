It could be the kiss of death for office productivity.

The popular mobile messaging application WhatsApp is now available on your office computer as well as your phone.

The firm today launched a much rumoured web version of its service linked to the mobile app - but admitted it would not work with Apple's iPhone.

Your phone needs to stay connected to the internet for our web client to work.

The app, acquired by Facebook last year for nearly $22 billion, unveiled the service today.

'Today, for the first time, millions of you will have the ability to use WhatsApp on your web browser,' it said in a blog post. 

WhatsApp, which claims some 500 million users, said its Web service will be a 'mirror' and would require an Internet-connected phone to work.

'Our Web client is simply an extension of your phone: the Web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device.

'This means all of your messages still live on your phone,' WhatsApp said in a blog post.

The new messaging service currently only works with Google's Chrome browser and will not be available to iPhone users 'due to Apple platform limitations,' according to WhatsApp.

Facebook in October completed its buy of WhatsApp in a stock-and-cash deal.

'Unfortunately for now, we will not be able to provide web client to our iOS users due to Apple platform limitations.'
