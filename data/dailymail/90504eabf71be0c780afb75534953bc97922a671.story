Inspector Mike Jones, officer in charge at British Transport Police Cardiff, said: 'It is staggering that people are still willing to risk everything by entering the railway - doing so with a baby in tow simply defies belief.

'Their behaviour is utterly reprehensible.

'Parents and adults should be leading by example, taking responsibility and emphasising the dangers to children.

'The few seconds saved by crossing the tracks could end up costing your life.'Â
