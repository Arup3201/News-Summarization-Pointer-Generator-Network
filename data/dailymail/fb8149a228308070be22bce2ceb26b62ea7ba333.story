He lives in one of the most glamorous cities on Earth, has an estimated £600million fortune and has his pick of the world's most lavish hotels when he wants to go on holiday.

But rather than join Prince Andrew and the Danish royals on the slopes in Verbier, Monaco's Prince Albert II has been enjoying a luxury break in Mumbles.

The 56-year-old royal certainly proved a hit with locals, posing happily for photos with a policewoman and accepting a kiss from rugby player turned wrestler Non Evans while quaffing champagne in one of the resort's bars.

Worried Albert? The royal gets a kiss from rugby player turned wrestler Non Evans in a Mumbles bar

The Monégasque prince arrived in Wales on Friday night, flying into  Cardiff by private jet before joining footballer Craig Bellamy for supper at a local steakhouse and front-row seats at the rugby.

Unfortunately for Albert's host, the game ended in a win for England - a result that the royal, who had been supporting the home team, described as 'disappointing'. 

Drowning his sorrows with £160 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne at a Mumbles bar later that evening, Albert told owner Adam Jones that he had hoped for a different outcome.

'He was supporting Wales and said he was disappointed by the outcome of the game,' explained Mr Jones, who also revealed that the royal had remained at the bar until 2am.

'I couldn’t believe how friendly and down to earth he was. He is a really nice guy and he took the time to speak to everyone, including the staff.

'It was an incredible weekend. The bar has been opened for five years, but this is the best weekend we have had so far.'

Albert, who was staying at the five star Patricks Hotel, spent Saturday exploring the spectacular Gower peninsula and took in the region from the air during a 30-minute helicopter tour.

Afterwards, he visited the local lifeboat station, where he was presented with a pair of knitted dolls for his two-month-old twins, Prince Jacques Honore Ranier and Princess Gabriella Therese Marie.

Speaking afterwards, lifeboat captain Dai Thomas said the prince had enjoyed his tour. 'He was interested in the lifeboat station and the new system we’ve got,' explained Mr Thomas.

'He was thrilled and thought the lifeboat was one of the best he had seen.'

Mumbles, which is famous for its spectacular sandy beaches, has long been a popular holiday destination and boasts a listed Victorian pier.

Although not an obvious choice of destination for a visiting head of state, the area has hosted several royal visits, most notably from Queen Alexandra in 1904.

Like Alexandra, Albert ended his visit to Wales with a trip to Swansea, where he watched the local side take on Sunderland in the Premier League.

After watching the teams draw 1-1, the royal flew back to Monaco to join his wife Charlene, 36, and their baby twins at the Palais Princier.

It might not be quite as glamorous as Monte Carlo but what Mumbles - and the surrounding Gower peninsula - lacks in glitz, it more than makes up for in natural beauty.

Highlights include the curving Swansea Bay which covers a six-mile stretch of Bristol Channel coastline and ends in Mumbles itself.

Along with its magnificent pier, which was built in 1898, Mumbles is also home to the mediaeval Oystermouth Castle which was built in 1203 and glowers out over the village from its perch atop a hill.

The majority of visitors, however, use their Mumbles break to explore the stunning Gower peninsula, a 70 square mile finger of land that juts out into the Irish Sea.

Its waters are home to an incredible array of wildlife, including whales and dolphins, while its dramatic coastline boasts a series of small rocky bays popular with daytrippers.
