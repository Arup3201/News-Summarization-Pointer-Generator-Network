A heavily pregnant mother who falsely claimed she was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder to get her husband’s attention has been exposed as a benefit cheat after letting slip she worked as a chef.

Amy Tatton had originally told police she had come face to face with an armed man in her kitchen after getting out of bed at 3am for a glass of water.

But the 30-year-old, who is due to give birth to her second child in six weeks’ time, later admitted she invented the story to grab the attention of her husband Timothy, 26 – and was charged with wasting police time.

She later faced a second investigation by benefits officials after telling her local paper in an interview about her ‘terrifying encounter’ that she worked as a chef.

Caught out: Amy Tatton, of Lincoln, falsely claimed she was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder to get her husband's attention. But she was exposed as a benefit cheat after letting slip she worked as a chef

Tatton pleaded guilty to wasting police time earlier this year and was ordered to pay just £500 compensation – although her lies cost taxpayers £1,238.71 in wasted man hours and redundant forensic tests.

But after a tell-all interview with the Lincolnshire Echo, checks showed that she had failed to declare he job.

Benefits officials also discovered that she failed to reveal that she was on child tax credits and maternity allowance.

James Ellis, prosecuting, told Lincoln Magistrates Court, that the charges were a direct result of her interview.

Tatton, of Lincoln, admitted five charges of failing to notify changes in her circumstances between 5 March 2010 and 29 July 2012.

She was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to repay £2,481.14 in overpaid housing benefit and £75 costs.

Mitigating, Bill Miller said: ‘Her initial claim in January 2010 was perfectly valid but thereafter my client did start working.

‘Her recollection is that she notified the local authority by telephone of that employment but there is no record of that and it may be that her recollection is deficient.

‘She then began working directly for a nursery. She then claimed maternity allowance at the Job Centre which ended when she went back to work.

‘Her understanding of the claim for child tax credit is that her husband had notified the authorities about the birth of their child.

He said that she no longer in employment and no longer receives Income Support.

Tatton was arrested originally arrested in September after holes in her account emerged and she was charged in November.

She told investigators and her local newspaper that the burglar shoved her against the kitchen worktop and struck her across the face.

She also claimed the man grabbed a vegetable knife and scraped it down her arm before fleeing empty handed and said her husband slept through the incident in June last year.

Tatton claimed the suspect was 5ft 7in tall, with short blond hair, and was wearing dark trousers and jacket.

Officers even showed her dozens of pictures of burglars from their database in a bid to catch the culprit.

Tatton admitted wasting police time on June 20 last year in an appearance before Lincoln magistrates last month.

She even tried to blame her husband, moaning to officers about him neglecting her and not showing her enough attention.
