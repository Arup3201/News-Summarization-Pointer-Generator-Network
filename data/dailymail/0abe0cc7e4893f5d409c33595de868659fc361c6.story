The Salvation Army has encountered its first trafficking victim brought in for organ removal (posed by model)

A charity working with victims of human trafficking in Britain has faced its first case of a person being brought into the country for organ harvesting.

An unnamed woman was brought into the UK by criminals operating a black market trade in body parts for transplant.

New details were released today by the Salvation Army, which was awarded a contract by the Ministry of Justice to provide victims with safe accommodation, counselling, medical care, translation services and legal counselling.

During the first six months of the contract, more than two fifths (41 per cent) of the people they worked with in England and Wales were male.

The charity helped 112 women and 78 men between July 1 and December 31 last year, supporting them through their experiences and helping them rebuild their lives.

Almost half (45 per cent) had been forced into sexual exploitation, while 43 per cent were trafficked into forced labour and eight per cent into domestic servitude.

The police referred 44 per cent of the victims, with the south east of England accounting for more than half (54 per cent) of referrals.

The majority of the 190 had come from eastern Europe (58 per cent), a quarter had been brought in from Africa and 12 per cent from Asia, while another four per cent had been trafficked from within UK borders.

A survey conducted by YouGov also revealed the public's misconceptions about the face of human trafficking. Respondents thought 68 per cent of victims were sexually exploited - a much higher proportion than that seen by the Salvation Army - and that just 29 per cent of victims in England and Wales were male.

Among the male victims helped by the Salvation Army were two men from the Czech Republic, who had been trafficked to the UK for forced labour after they answered a job advert in a national newspaper.

The pair, who had thought they were being taken on as factory supervisors in England, told how they were sold numerous times between gangmasters within the UK.

Crispin Blunt: The Minister for Justice said 'male victims are often overlooked'

The Salvation Army gave the victims temporary accommodation and support until they were able to Scotland amd start a new life.

One of them, named only as Aleksandr, said: 'I was given the number of The Salvation Army.

'They saved me and they took me to a police station, where I made a statement.

'That same day, we helped my friend to escape who had been trafficked the same way as me.

'The Salvation Army hid us in a safe house.

'It's sad but it's true: there are hundreds of people with similar stories to me, people who have been fraudulently bought and sold.'

Major Anne Read, the Salvation Army's anti-trafficking response co-ordinator, said: 'Male or female, no matter where the victim is in England and Wales or the reason that they are trafficked, we are helping all people caught up in all types of trafficking to get them the support they need, when they need it.

'The Salvation Army has a strong track record of supporting victims of human trafficking and we are working with a wide range of experts in delivering the contract to ensure that specialist, individually tailored support is available to every victim.

'This includes gender-specific services and support for victims with disabilities and mental health needs.'

Minister for Justice, Crispin Blunt, said: 'Human trafficking is often seen as predominantly affecting women - meaning that male victims are often overlooked and are forced to go without the support they so desperately need.

'The support The Salvation Army offer to trafficking victims, regardless of gender, was a key reason why they were awarded the contract.

'In the first six months of providing this service, The Salvation Army have shown that they are able to offer a high quality, tailored system of support to some of the most vulnerable victims, regardless of their country of origin, religion or gender.'
