Luke Tobin, 23, of Cardiff, denied wounding Matthew James with intent to do him grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court

An Afghanistan veteran has been jailed for a jealous attack on his ex-partner's new boyfriend after finding him hiding in a wardrobe at her home.

Luke Tobin, 23, of Cardiff, denied wounding Matthew James with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, but was found guilty by a jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court after a jury heard he had taken pictures of the attack on his mobile phone. 

Mr James suffered a fractured nose and eye socket in the attack by Tobin, after he had forced his way into his ex-girlfriend Coral Samuel's house, and discovered him in the cupboard.

He has been jailed for eight years for the brutal attack. 

The jury heard that Tobin, a soldier of five years' standing who had completed tours of Afghanistan, had been the boyfriend of Ms Samuel, the mother of a young child.

Despite that relationship breaking down in August 2013, Tobin and she continued to see each other and he had stayed over.

But after telling him that she had started to see someone else, Tobin went around to her house in Treharris, Merthyr Tydfil, in September last year and forced his way in.

When he got inside, he went upstairs and found Mr James hiding.

Tobin called him a 'pussy' before laying into him in a relentless attack, kicking and punching him repeatedly while his partner's young child slept in the next room.

During the sustained assault, Tobin told him he was going to 'finish him' and before Tobin left, he took photographs of the damage he had caused, telling Ms Samuel 'I've done a good job'.

Byron Broadstock, defending Tobin, who had no previous convictions, said he had harboured hopes of rekindling his relationship and had been confused at its status because he had continued to see her.

He had also run a trial, said Mr Broadstock, because he wanted to rejoin the army and the consequence of a conviction would have made that impossible.

Mr Broadstock said Tobin had displayed remorse but he was told by Judge Richard Twomlow: 'Real remorse would have been shown by a guilty plea at an early stage.

'You lost your temper when you saw Mr James in the house.

'He was so frightened he hid in a wardrobe. The attack was sustained and violent.

'You have been affected by your experiences in Afghanistan but this attack was the direct result of jealousy and losing your temper on finding Mr James in the house.'

Tobin will serve half the sentence in jail before being released and will have to pay a £120 victim surcharge.
