Cereal fever seems to have taken hold in Britain as the country welcomes its second cereal-only cafe. 

Best friends Zoe Blogg and pal Jen Gibb have opened the breakfast-speciality joint Moo'd in Leeds.

Moo'd offers more than 100 different cereals, as well as 'cocktails' consisting of mixed varieties of different brands - and the milk for cereals comes from an old ale pump.

The duo say they registered their business before London cafe Cereal Killers 

The duo reckon they are on to a winner after being swarmed with hungry customers on their opening day - eager to have a bowl of the breakfast treat.

Unlike their hipster rivals who were slammed after opening expensive Cereal Killer Cafe in one of the poorest parts of inner-city London, Zoe and Jen are offering much more reasonably-priced bowls of unusual cereals.

So far, Moo'd has gone down a storm with Leeds locals, no doubt impressed with the modest £2-a-bowl pricetag and the fact the milk comes from an old ale pump.

Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, Zoe, 23, said: 'We came up with the idea when we were students in Leeds.

'We both wanted to go out and get a bowl of cereal but all we could get were fry-ups.

There will be more than 100 different types of cereal from all over the world served in the cafe 

'We actually registered our business before Cereal Killers registered theirs, so it's not like we saw their idea and copied it.

'We've been working on Moo'd for nearly a year now.'

Moo'd offers more than 100 different cereals, as well as 'cocktails' consisting of mixed varieties of different brands.

Zoe said: 'We spent ages trying to work out what combinations of cereals worked for the cocktails.

'We had one idea called 'What Nana Eats,' which had Shreddies, Bran Flakes and Pink Wafers but that was ridiculously dry.'

Zoe and Jen are taking their new business seriously, with hopes to introduce a takeaway option and expand into other cities.

The pair met on a marketing course at Leeds Beckett University, before starting work on the project last year.

Jen, also 23, added: 'We had one woman from UKIP on the telly say it was 'a waste of money and resources', and another person said everyone should have a fry-up every day, but apart from that the feedback we've got has been great.'

Leeds University second year Politics student Aron Keller was one of the first to visit the cafe when it opened on Thursday.

He said: 'After the recent opening of the UK's first cereal cafe  in East London recently, I was intrigued to see what Moo'd in Leeds had to offer.

'The owners were really friendly and enthusiastic.

'The vibe is hip but not too kitschy.

'The cafe itself is small but spacious and there's a definite quaint, coffee-shop feel about the place.'

Not wanting to be left behind, two rivals are racing to become Manchester's first cereal cafe.  

Black Milk Cereal Dive has confirmed it will open in Afflecks Palace next month and according to Twitter, Cereal Central MCR is 'coming soon'.

Both establishments will serve breakfast cereals from around the world.   

An international cereal menu: Offerings from America include Banana Puffs and Reese's Puffs

It comes months after Alan and Gary Keery opened the country's first cereal cafe in Shoreditch, London.  

With 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk, self-confessed cereal obsessives the twins have taken their love of the breakfast staple to new heights with UK's first cereal cafe.

The establishment opened last December in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world.

Open from 7am to 8pm, The Cereal Killer Cafe srves breakfast, lunch and dinner in an environment bursting with 'cereal memorabilia from the Eighties and Nineties'.

There are also vintage televisions dotted about the interior, running old cartoons on a loop. 

The idea of the cafe came to 32-year-old Belfast boys Alan and Gary when they were craving cereal for lunch one afternoon but couldn't find a restaurant that would serve them the breakfast main.

'We were wandering around Shoreditch one lunch looking for cereal when the lightbulb moment hit,' Gary told FEMAIL.

There will be over 100 types of cereal on offer at the Cereal Killer Cafe  from America, South Korea and France

'We researched, what cereals were available in the UK and which ones would be easy to source and took it from there.'

Cereals are sourced from America, South Africa, France, Australia, South Korea as well as the UK and will be served alongside 13 varieties of milk as well as 20 types of topping.

'We have normal milk as well as lacto-free milk, oat milk, hazelnut milk and almond milk. There will also be varieties of flavoured milk,'Gary continued.

The cafe also serves coffee for those who want a stronger hit with their milky breakfast treat.

Gary said: 'There are five different peanut butter cereals on the menu as well as cereal cocktails including Smore Than Words (a combination of Golden Grahams, Mini Marshmallows and chocolate milk) and Crunchy Nutcase (mix of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes and Clusters, walnuts, pecans and hazelnut milk) and Cap'n Crunch peanut butter real with strawberry pops and strawberry milk.'
