Internet access is as essential as water, the government has been warned as figures show 6.4million people have never been online.

The government is under pressure to increase high speed web access across the country, with more and more official services now only offered digitally.

Almost all 16 to 24 year olds used the internet in the first three months of this year, compared with just a third of over-75s, amid claims it is now ‘impossible to function’ without broadband.

New figures from the Office for National Statistics shows how the proportion of people using the internet is continuing to fall

Some 4.6 million adults in the UK used the internet in the first quarter of this year, up 1.1 million on the same time in 2013.

However, 6.4 million – 13 per cent of all adults - had never used the internet. In all, 89 per cent of men used the internet, compared to 85 per cent of women.

London had the highest proportion of web users (90 per cent) while Northern Ireland had lowest (79 per cent).

In the House of Lords, the government was warned it needed to do more to roll-out high speed broadband across the country.

Tory peer Baroness Neville-Rolfe said: ‘Broadband and mobile coverage have become essential utilities, like water or power.

‘Without coverage it is like living in the old world without a post box or hot water,’ the former Number 10 policy official said.

She the government needed to encourage the industry and the regulator ‘to buck up and meet their obligations to citizens and businesses, all of whom now need to be able to operate online’.

Men are more likely to have used the internet than women, the new figures show

99.3 per cent of women aged 16-24 have used the internet, compared to 29.5 over over-75s

Lord Addington, a senior Lib Dem, added: ‘It is virtually impossible to function without broadband.’

He asked how ‘people are supposed to cope until this situation is corrected’.

Campaigners are particularly concerned that older people, who are less likely to be online, will struggle access government services.

Of the 6.4 million adults who have never used the internet, almost half were aged 75 years and over.

However, in the last three years the proportion of adults aged 75 years and over who have ever used the internet has increased by 13 percentage points

Higher earners are also more likey to use the web. Amongst people earning more than £500-a-week, or £26,000-a-year, almost everyone uses the internet.

But among those earning less than £200-a-week or £10,400, one in 20 had never used the internet.

London had the highest proportion of web users (90 per cent) while Northern Ireland had lowest (79 per cent)

The government insists that good progress is being made to roll-out superfast broadband.

Culture minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble said: ‘In January this year the programme was making superfast broadband available to 10,000 premises a week.

‘The figure is now 20,000 a week, and by the summer it will be 40,000 a week. More than half a million premises have benefited so far and more than 4 million will benefit by the end of the programme.

‘For mobile, the combination of commercial and government mobile rollout will improve mobile services for 98% of UK premises by 2015.

‘Clearly, we are in part of the technological revolution and the Government wish to go digital, but it is certainly important that those who do not have the facility are still able to conduct business in a traditional way.’
