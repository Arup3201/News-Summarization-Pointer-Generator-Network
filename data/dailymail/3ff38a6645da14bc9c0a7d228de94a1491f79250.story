Residents in a Sussex street were left with a very different parking problem when a hot air balloon suddenly landed between parked cars in the middle of their street. 

The balloon flew close to the roofs of houses in Midhurst in Sussex, leading people to fear they could be hit by the craft, before it made an emergency landing.

People who witnessed the strange arrival of the balloon said that pilots told them it had run out of fuel and been forced to land. 

A hot air balloon was forced to make an emergency landing between parked cars in a residential street in Midhurst in Sussex after the craft reportedly ran out of fuel and it was seen flying close to roofs of houses 

They claimed to have seen the pilots struggling to keep the flame going before making the emergency landing.  

The craft, which used to be owned by British Airways but now belongs to a private owner, sailed down to the middle of Barlavington Way in Midhurst at about 12.30pm on Tuesday. It was one of three seen at the time but was the only balloon to make an emergency landing. 

Steve Bull captured the incident on camera and said: 'It was more worrying than surreal as it slowly descended towards and then between houses.

'We often see hot air balloons in the sky around here in the summer but never in the winter.'

Others said they were concerned that buildings or cars could be damaged by the surprise landing but said they were impressed when the pilot managed to calmly land the craft between two vehicles. 

Sophie May Lewis, 22, who lives on the street, said the pilots claimed they were running low on gas and were forced to ditch in the street.

People living in Barlavington Way said they were shocked to discover a hot air balloon parked in the road 

She said: 'Quite a few people had come out to have a look but they were only in the street around half an hour and then they were gone.

'The pilots were quite lucky there was a space between the parked cars but they landed it expertly. They did a brilliant job.

'It was quite an impressive sight when they deflated but I think a few people were a bit worried about their cars.'

Writing on the Midhurst Facebook page, Simone Pontet-piccolomini added: 'There were 3 on the horizon when i first saw them then this one landed right at the end of my little road....i watched as the pilot struggled to get the flame going....neatly done though...i saw the other 2 in the distance, both pretty low over the town.' 

After the surprise landing the pilots were forced to carefully deflate the balloon and remove it. 

The balloon is emblazoned with a British Airways logo and has the name Concorde on its side. 

It took pilots about 30 minutes to deflate the craft and pack it up so they could take it away from the street 

The balloon had to be carefully deflated after it landed and was packed up and removed in half an hour 

However, according to records held by the Civil Aviation Authority BA sold the hot air balloon in 2008 and it was bought by Anthony Brown, of Guildford. Mr Brown is listed in connection with Reach for the Sky Limited, a hot air balloon flight company. Mr Brown could not be reached for comment by MailOnline today. 

Charlie Bush, who also lives in the road, told the Midhurst and Petworth Observer that the pilots said they had been 'running low on gas'.

She added: 'He said a few of them had set off, but they had to bring it down here. They could see there was a clear space in the road, and were only there for about half an hour.'

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has not been contacted about the incident.

A CAA spokesman said: 'Unfortunately this sort of incident does happen from time-to-time.

'The fact is that sometimes if the wind is in the wrong direction or there is some sort of fault then pilots have to put down somewhere, even in an urban area. They are perfectly entitled to do that. It is not like a plane landing there. They are trained to do it.'
