A new film lifts the lid on history’s most extraordinary sisters; conjoined British twins Daisy and Violet Hilton.

Under the scheming control of a promoter, they were exploited as freaks and became one of the hottest attractions in a travelling circus in the early 1900s.

Fascinated by the pair, director Leslie Zemeckis spent years researching them for her upcoming documentary, Bound by Flesh.

Daisy and Violet were born to 
21-year-old maid Kate Skinner in Brighton, 1908, as the result of Kate’s
 affair with one of her bosses son.

The
 twins were joined back-to-back at their lower spine, and Skinner was 
convinced this deformity was God’s punishment for her dalliance.

She
 sold them off to a midwife named Mary Hilton, who adopted the girls and
 promptly displayed them in a local pub touting the twin’s deformity to 
make money.

Reports have
 said that Mary abused them both physically and mentally. After her 
death in 1915, Mary's daughter Edith Hilton and her husband Meyer 
Meyers, a sideshow producer, were waiting to take their own control of 
the girls.

They took them to America, where the sisters eventually gained citizenship, and paraded them around the country, heralding them as vaudeville, sideshow performers and freaks.

It wasn’t long before the sister act – the UK's first pair of conjoined twins to survive infancy – became world famous.

They performed around the globe with the likes of Bob Hope and appeared in the films Freaks (1932) and Chained for Life (1950).

But
 in 1931, older, wiser and still not receiving a penny of their amassed 
fortune from Myers, they sued their managers for their freedom in a 
widely-publicized trial.

As
 reported in Charlotte Magazine – the local magazine for the U.S. town, 
Charlotte, North Carolina where the sisters spent the last days of their
 lives - they talked about their experience in an autobiography, The 
Lives and Loves of the Hilton Sisters, published in 1942.

‘We [were] lonely, rich girls who were really paupers living in practical slavery,’ Daisy recalled.

After taking their career into their own hands, the sisters attracted a string of admirers.

To
 avoid one of them playing the gooseberry they had a telephone booth 
installed in their plush New York apartment, specially modified so that 
one twin could sit inside whispering sweet nothings to her lover on the 
phone, while the other sat outside reading a magazine or filing her 
nails.

One admirer, world 
famous magician Harry Houdini, taught the sisters how to mentally 
separate themselves from each other if one was to be engaging in sexual 
activity.

Mental Liberty, as
 they called it, gave them remarkable tolerance of each other’s romantic
 interludes. ‘Why, I just turn over and read a book and eat an apple,’ 
said Violet.

In 1934, Violet
 became engaged to a handsome bandleader named Maurice Lambert, but 
after their application for a marriage licence had been turned down in 
21 states - all arguing it would be immoral to sanction the union of one
 man and two women - Lambert lost heart and ended the relationship.

To
 restore their superstar status,  publicity agent Terry Turner  
suggested one of the twins should get married at the newly-opened 
70,000-seat Cotton Bowl sports stadium in Dallas. The groom was to be a 
lifelong friend of the sisters, a dancer named Jim Moore. Violet agreed 
to be Moore’s bride even though they knew he was homosexual (the 
marriage was never consummated).

Violet
 later made the mistake of admitting it was a sham and filed for 
divorce. She claimed she had been coerced into the marriage by Turner, 
but loyal fans were furious to discover they had been conned. The Hilton
 twins had suddenly lost their endearing innocence and their careers 
never recovered.

Daisy died 
from a severe bout of flu in 1968, by which point the sisters were 
working in a local supermarket in Charlotte. Because the twins were 
attached only by skin and not organs, Violet was not in danger. But just
 a few days later, Violet died, too and both bodies were found in their 
hallway by their boss.

Their final wish? That they should remain joined in death, in one, unusually wide coffin.

Zemeckis' film is released in the U.S. on June 27, though a UK release date is to be confirmed.
