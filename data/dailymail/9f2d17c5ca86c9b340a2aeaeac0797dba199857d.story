They may look cute and cuddly, but these puppies will soon be helping to bring down the toughest criminals in Britain.

They are being trained by West 
Midlands Police as specialist search dogs hunting for weapons, drugs, 
cash, stolen items or explosives and the evidence they will uncover is 
often crucial in securing convictions.

The Springer spaniels - three boys and 
six girls - were born on December 8 into the 'O' litter and are named 
Odem, Orville, Osca, Oreo, Olivia, Olympia, Oriel, Oxo and Oasis.

West Midlands Police asked Twitter users to name the new recruits by using the hashtag Â£nameourpups.

Breed scheme manager Dave Raymond, said: 'Clearly a few Baggies fans entered as Odemwingie was tweeted in a few times and I don't think Opium is appropriate for a police dog.

'It's the first time we've turned to our Twitter followers for help naming our puppies and it's proved hugely successful.

'The pups are 20 days old now; their eyes are open and they're starting to get a bit more adventurous. In the next few days we'll be weaning them on milk away from mum Grace and also introducing a few rags and toys for them to play with.

'We'll keep everyone updated on the pups' progress with regular photos and videos.'

Turning to the web: Mr Arnett asked Twitter users to come up with the names of the new brood

The force runs the largest, most 
successful police dog breed scheme in the UK with more than 80 per cent 
of all dogs going through the training programme becoming operational.

Any that don't make the grade are sold as working dogs or given to good homes.

Mr Raymond said: 'Brood bitches are selected for their exemplary search skills, stability, responsiveness and temperament.

'They have blood and eye tests to make sure they don't pass on any hereditary conditions.'

New recruits: The pups were born to mother Grace and father Tom, a five-year-old explosives search specialist

Mother Grace was born into the breed scheme in August 2009.

This is her second litter and, in line with Kennel Club guidelines, she'll have no more than four in her lifetime and only one in any 12-month period.

In between, she enjoys life at home with volunteers as a family pet.

O Litter's dad is West Midlands Police Dog Tom, a five-year-old explosives search specialist.
