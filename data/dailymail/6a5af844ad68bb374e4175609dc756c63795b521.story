With just ten days to go before the Mayan apocalypse supposedly spells the end of the world, many believers may be looking for ways to dodge doomsday.

But one farmer in China believes he is ready for any eventuality after building seven emergency survival pods.

Liu Qiyuan created the fibreglass shells - dubbed Noah's Ark - after being inspired by the apocalyptic Hollywood movie 2012.

Prepared: Farmer Liu Qiyuan looks out from inside one of seven survival pods that he has also dubbed Noah's Arc

Ready for trouble: Farmer Liu Qiyuan exits one of seven survival pods in  a yard at his home in the village of Qiantun, Hebei province, south of Beijing

Heavy work: Workers reposition one of seven survival pods. His creations consist of a fibreglass shell around a steel frame

Building them around a steel frame in a yard at his home in
 the village of Qiantun, Hebei province, south of Beijing, he says the 
pods can offer life-saving shelter during natural disasters such as 
tsunamis and hurricanes.

The pods are able to float on water and some of have their own propulsion.

The
 airtight spheres with varying interiors contain oxygen tanks and 
seatbelts with space for around 14 people, and are designed to remain 
upright when in water.

Inspiration: Liu Qiyuan was inspired by the apocalyptic Hollywood movie '2012' and the 2004 Asian tsunami

Greater good: Farmer Liu Qiyuan secures a hatch He hopes that his creations will be adopted by government departments and international organisations for use in the event of tsunamis and earthquakes

Design: The pods are able to float on water. The airtight spheres with varying interiors contain oxygen tanks and seatbelts with space for around 14 people, and are designed to remain upright when in water

He hopes that his creations will be 
adopted by government departments and international organisations for 
use in the event of tsunamis and earthquakes.

They are heavy and four men required to help pulley them when he needs to move them across the yard.

Earlier this year Chinese businessman Yang Zongfu unveiled his orange Â£150,000 emergency disaster survival pod.

According
 to Yang, 'the reserve and life-sustaining system' inside the yellow 
sphere 'could ensure a family of three live safely inside for 10 
months'.
