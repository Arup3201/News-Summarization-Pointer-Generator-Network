If Dr Frankenstein were to create a footballer who combined prolific goal scoring (and some questionable dance moves) with a dynamic midfielder, he might come up with something like this...

Instead, it is Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge - using the sort of cutting edge technology no doubt found on a smart phone - who has morphed his face with the Reds captain, named him 'Studgie G', and posted the image on his Instagram account.

Liverpool returned from their pre-season tour of the United States on Tuesday, having signed off with a 3-1 defeat to arch rivals Manchester United in the final of the Guiness International Champions Cup.

Sturridge returned home early after suffering a hamstring injury - joining an increasing number of players on the treatment table, including Lazar Markovic, Jon Flanagan, Fabio Borini, Tiago Ilori, Adam Lallana and Oussama Assaidi.

Manager Brendan Rodgers was not overly concerned, saying: 'Dan has flown back to the UK. He wasn't going to be ready for the game on Monday - but there's no concern there, he'll be ready for Borussia Dortmund at the weekend.

Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard could not prevent Liverpool losing 3-1 to arch rivals Manchester United 

'It was just best to get him back early, back to the training ground so he could get some treatment there. He had a really, really slight feeling in his hamstring. It's nothing major.'

Brendan Rodgers side can feel optimistic about the new season after winning three and losing two games in the US while the loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona has been compensated by the arrival of several new signings.

Liverpool will play their final pre-seaon game against Borussia Dortmund at Anfield on Sunday August 10 before beginning their Premier League campaign against Southampton on August 17.
