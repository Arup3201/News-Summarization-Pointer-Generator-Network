The New York borough of Queens has been given top spot in a list of the best places to visit in the US next year.

The sprawling suburb, traditionally off the tourist map, has beaten a host of America's most famous destinations in an annual 'Best in the US' ranking compiled by Lonely Planet.

The list praised Queens' microbreweries, beaches, global food offerings and ‘world-class’ art scene.

Lonely Planet praised the culinary scene that has sprung up around Rockaway Beach in Queens

As well as edging out its neighbouring and fashionable neighbour Brooklyn, Queens also triumphed over runners-up including western South Dakota, New Orleans, and North Conway and New Hampshire.

‘Nowhere is the image of New York as the global melting pot truer than Queens,’ said Lonely Planet in its best-of list.

It added: ‘Browse New York’s biggest Chinatown in Flushing, shop for brilliantly coloured saris in Jackson Heights, and inhale the heady aromas of coffee and hookahs in Astoria.’

Queens has been described as a cultural 'melting pot' with more than 135 languages spoken in the area

‘The incomparable array of world cuisines makes Queens a destination for food lovers from all parts of New York City.

‘For your art fix, ogle the new upgrades to the Queens Museum and the Museum of the Moving Image, look for the new Emerging Artists Festival in Long Island City, and stroll Astoria’s new 24-block arts district.

‘If you prefer sand and surf to paint and canvas, head to Rockaway. Don’t miss the prime eating and drinking scene that has popped up around the boardwalk - this is no cruddy carnival food: think succulent fish tacos, wood-fired pizzas, and wine bars.’

Borough President Melinda Katz has made tourism a priority of her administration since she took office last year, launching a marketing plan aimed at increasing visitation.

‘Queens is hot and on the move, and we’re thrilled by the growing attention and interest that the rest of the world has in its borough,’ Ms Katz said in a statement on the borough's website.

Queens triumphed over popular US destinations including New Orleans, Louisiana, which came in third place

The Colorado River was another US tourist destination that lost out to Queens in the Lonely Planet's list

North Conway in New Hampshire came in fifth place in the Lonely Planet's 2015 Best in the US list

1. Queens, New York

2. Western South Dakota

3. New Orleans, Louisiana

4. Colorado River region

5. North Conway, New Hampshire

6. Indianapolis, Indiana

7. Greenville, South Carolina

8. Oakland, California

9. Duluth, Minnesota

10. Mount Shasta region, California 

‘This is a top destination of choice for people from around the globe to live, work and play. Our neighbourhoods are home to families that hail from over 120 countries and speak over 135 languages, so our diversity is a natural and tremendous asset to the international capital of the world.

‘You haven’t really seen New York City unless you have experienced Queens.’

Queens residents also highlighted the benefits of their own neighbourhood.

‘I think if you want a more immersive local experience when you visit New York City, then coming to Queens would give that to you,’ Sylvia Frys, a student at Hunter College who lives in Astoria, told CNBC.

‘Everyone else who comes to New York would just be getting the generic, touristy experience.’

Regis St. Louis, who contributes to Lonely Planet's USA guidebooks, said Queens was a diamond in the rough with its famous attractions and now word-of-mouth has made it more popular.

‘Increasingly, people are looking for more personal experiences and you can find them in Queens. You get a local flavour that is lacking in a more touristy part of Manhattan,’ he said.

Western South Dakota came in second on Lonely Planet’s list.

New York City saw more than 54 million tourists last year, with many heading to the trendy borough of Brooklyn

The other destinations in the top 10 were, in order, New Orleans, the Colorado River region, North Conway, Indianapolis, Greenville, Oakland, Duluth, and the Mount Shasta Region.

New York City saw more than 54 million tourists in 2013, according to NYC & Company.

But not everyone in New York is so sure that Queens deserved the top spot, with some suggesting that the fashionable area of Brooklyn, which won top spot in the Lonely Planet’s 2007 list, still had the edge over its neighbouring borough.

Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Carlo Scissura told CNBC: ‘It was nice to see that our next door neighbour got a little love, but I think we all know there is still no place like Brooklyn. We're still the coolest, hottest place in the world.’
