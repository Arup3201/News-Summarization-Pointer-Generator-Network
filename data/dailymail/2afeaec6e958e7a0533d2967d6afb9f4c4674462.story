According to Lonely Planet, the Wilton's Music Hall is a glorious and truly atmospheric surprise, while Kinmel Arms in Abergele, Conwy, is a ‘top-notch enclave of fine food, real ale and boutique accommodation’.

'Overlooked': Wilton's Music Hall in East London has made it on to the Lonely Planet list

Secret location: Battle in East Sussex is one of the UK's overlooked locations, according to Lonely Planet

The other UK entries in the list of 50 overlooked destinations in Europe include Battle in East Sussex, the South Cotswolds, and the eastern shore of Loch Ness in Scotland.

Scooping the number one spot is historic Olomouc, in the Czech Republic, which Lonely Planet says is 'practically unknown', adding the main square 'counts among the country's most charming'.

Cabo de Gata in Spain, which boasts the country's 'most beautiful and least crowded beaches' was crowned Europe's second best secret spot; while in third place is Kraków, Poland, for its tucked-away bar scene dotted around narrow streets.

Hidden destinations: The South Cotswolds, which includes Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire

Of the five British entries, Lonely Planet calls Wilton’s Music Hall: ‘A glorious and truly atmospheric surprise: a Victorian music hall, little-changed from its heyday in the late 19th century.’

Of Battle, the guide says that as well as observing ‘evocative fields where the arrows flew’, visitors are encouraged to explore ‘the village's deliciously quaint streets’ and ‘the glorious Sussex countryside’.

It adds: ‘The Battle of Hastings may be well known as the bloody stand-off in 1066 that inspired the Bayeux tapestry, but few make the journey to see where it happened.’

It describes the Kinmel Arms in 
Abergele, Conwy, Wales, as a ‘top-notch enclave of fine food, real ale 
and boutique accommodation’.

Little visited: Dores, the eastern shore of Loch Ness, which is named as one of the UK's top secret locations

Overlooked locations: The map inside Lonely Planet's Secret Europe book shows where the destinations are

It calls the South Cotswolds ‘overlooked’ with most tourists opting to explore the North Cotswolds. 

The guide says: ‘This area is a hidden gem, with scenic villages and tranquil landscapes - and rarely a coach tour in sight.’

Number five on the UK locations featuring in the new book is the eastern side of Loch Ness, Scotland.

The guide adds: ‘While tour coaches pour down the west side of Loch Ness, the eastern shore is relatively peaceful.

Number one spot: Olomouc, Czech Republic, was named Europe's most overlooked destination

Stunning location: Cabo de Gata natural park, Spain, ranked second on the top 50 list

‘Here you will find Dores Inn, a beautifully restored country pub with a garden that even has its own Loch-Ness-Monster-spotting point. 

‘The menu specialises in quality Scottish produce.’

The author of Lonely Planet's Great Britain guidebook, David Else, said: ‘It's little wonder that Britain features heavily in Secret Europe.

‘With a wealth of breathtaking landscapes and such fascinating history, there's plenty that travellers are yet to discover.’
