A paint sprayer who had been doing extra shifts in order to pay for his wedding next year has been killed in an apparently motiveless attack while he made his way home from work.

Simon Holdsworth, 36, died of severe injuries after being attacked by 'one or more' people as he walked across fields close to his home in Sheffield, South Yorks.

Simon was due to marry his fiance Carleen McKeown in August and had just booked time off work, and was also about to celebrate his stepson's fourth birthday on Christmas eve.

Speaking through tears at a police press conference yesterday Carleen said: 'Simon was my rock. He was a bright shining light in my life we were so happy together as a family.

'It will be Tiarnan's fourth birthday on Christmas Eve. We had already been Christmas shopping and his presents are wrapped but his daddy won't be there to open them with him anymore.

'Simon's death has ripped my life apart.'

Police are appealing for anyone who was on the 120 bus between Mansfield Road, Intake, and Birley Spa Lane at around 11pm on Monday night to contact them with information.

Simon boarded the bus after finishing a shift at work and was on it for around fifteen minutes before he and another passenger got off and walked in different directions.

He then cut across some fields at the back of a Primary School, part of his regular walk home, where police think he was attacked moments later.

His body was found by a member of the public at 6.30 the following morning.

Simon's mother Christine Holdsworth said: 'What has happened to Simon has devastated our lives. We are such a close family and this has left a huge hole with all of us.

Simon's mother, Christine Holdsworth, said: 'You protect your children all your life and the one time he really needed me, I wasn't there'

'Simon was over the moon to be getting married next year. Simon would never, ever hurt anybody and we can't understand why anybody would want to hurt him.

'You protect your children all your life and the one time he really needed me, I wasn't there.'

Simon was a keen fisher and an avid fan of Sheffield Wednesday football club, where he was a season ticket holder.

A wreath has been placed on Simon's seat in the North Stand at Hillsborough and during today's game against Bournemouth the player wore black armbands.

Paying tribute to Simon, his boss Paul Essex said: 'During the last shift he ever did, Simon was in a bubbly and cheerful mood as he'd just that day booked the time off work for his wedding and honeymoon in August.

'He'd worked here for 16 years and was one of life's grafters. Over the past few weeks he'd been working extra hours to save up for his wedding which we know he was really excited about.

'The entire workforce is absolutely devastated by what has happened. We haven't just lost a colleague, we've lost a close friend. Simon was gentle, kind and loved by everyone.

'I would urge anybody with any information at all to come forward and tell the police. Whoever did this has to be caught and brought to justice.'

Detective Superintendent Phil Etheridge, who is leading the investigation, asked anyone who was on the bus or nearby who may may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact police.

Anyone who was a passenger on the bus or who has any information about Mr Holdsworth's murder can call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
