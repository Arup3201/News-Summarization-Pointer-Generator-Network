Up to a million passengers were caught in rail chaos yesterday in what Network Rail bosses said was ‘the worst disruption in recent memory’.

A quarter of all 8,000 trains running in Britain were cancelled or seriously delayed as 114mph gales, flooding and landslides threw services into disarray.

The fiasco is set to trigger compensation payouts to thousands of travellers.

Commuter services in the South East and long-distance Virgin West Coast services in the North West were among the worst hit.

Virgin Trains said around half of its services on the main Anglo-Scottish route from London to Glasgow were disrupted.

With up to 28 trains running in each direction from London to Scotland, it means thousands of passengers were affected.

Some services to Liverpool, Manchester and North Wales were also hit, but not as badly.

A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘Around 2,000 of the 8,000 services run were seriously delayed or cancelled. This is one of the worst disruptions in recent memory but is down to the adverse weather conditions.

‘We do apologise and hope passengers will understand.’

There was virtually no service at all on some lines.

Southeastern, which covers services from London to Kent and Sussex, only started running services at midday yesterday but last night it said timetables would be back to normal today.

Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said: ‘Passengers have had a tough week of travelling and unfortunately that is likely to continue for at least another day.’ He added that safety ‘comes first’.

On another day, a cheerful festive greeting from Virgin Trains may have passed with barely anyone noticing.

A spokesman tweeted: ‘We’re back in the game. Did everyone have a good Christmas?’ It was followed by: ‘We’re planning on running a normal service today.’

Alas, he spoke too soon as the cheery tweet became the focus of passenger fury when the schedule went off-track.

As its page was inundated with angry tweets,

Virgin posted more sober messages such as: ‘NEW: From 11.45am the line between Carlisle and Preston will be blocked for two hours to make repairs. Replacement buses will run.’

However, MPs said it was not good enough.

Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye, Amber Rudd, said she had received many gripes about Southeastern and its failure to supply buses to replace the trains. ‘I have received a lot of complaints about them,’ she said. ‘They have been just too complacent. The fact is that the buses are getting through.

‘Why haven’t Southeastern made sure that constituents who want to get to Tunbridge Wells or to London can use those buses?

‘Their point is that it’s a bit late in the day to try and get bus replacement services in place, but that’s not good enough.’

Labour MP Graham Stringer, a member of the all-party Commons transport select committee, said regulators should consider stripping franchises from those rail firms who have failed to deal effectively with the Christmas floods.

He said: ‘These failings sadly confirm what is already known. Rail companies’ performance has been extremely patchy and that should be taken into account when the system is  re-franchised. Some of these companies are clearly not capable of running a public service.’

However, Mr Gisby insisted Network Rail staff have been doing their best: ‘This has been one of the most challenging periods we have faced in recent times and our engineers have been doing all they can to get things moving again.

‘We’ve spent 48 hours clearing up the remains of trees, a lot of landslips, mudslides and washouts.

‘On top of that we’ve got our Christmas weekend engineering work, which kicked in on Christmas Eve. So I’m afraid what passengers are facing today is some disruption anyway because of the engineering work.’
