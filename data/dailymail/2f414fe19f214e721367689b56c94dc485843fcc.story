A cop who was injured following a shootout in the Bronx seems to still resent New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's recent support for the city's protesters.

NYPD officer Andrew Dossi was visited by Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bill Bratton at St. Barnabas Hospital Monday night after he and his partner were shot by robbers shortly at a grocery store after their shift ended Monday, and according to his father, the Mayor was not a welcome site.

'He wasn’t too happy about the Mayor’s visit,' said Joe Dossi.

This as the alleged gunman responsible for the attack has been taken into custody.

Not welcome: 'He wasn’t too happy about the Mayor’s visit,' said Joe Dossi, the officer's father, about Mayor Bill de Blasio (above) coming by the hospital

'He deals with some crappy people every day and getting no support (from Mayor de Blasio), come on,' added the elder Dossi while speaking with the New York Post. 

'These are the guys in the trenches dealing with anything and everything.'

This is reference to Mayor de Blasio's comments in the wake of a grand jury's decision not to indict the cop that killed Staten Island resident Eric Garner after placing the man in a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes that he worries for his son Dante, who is half-black, and how his interactions with the police will go as the young man grows up.

The elder Dossi also said he told Mayor de Blasio that men like his son were 'laying theit lives on the line' when he came into the hospital room Monday night.

The man also said he liked Commissioner Bratton, who he saw  as 'a real legitimate guy.'

Officer Dorsi, an Iraq veteran, was shot in the back and the arm.

The shot to his back barely missed his spine, though doctors believe he will make a full recovery.

'I just hope that doesn’t affect his career,' said his father. 

'He’s Army Airborne. He can’t jump out of airplanes with a messed-up arm.'

Putting it together: Three men have been taken into custody for questioning following the shooting (above), and one is believed to be the alleged gunman 

The NYPD currently has three men in custody who they are questioning over the shooting.

Two of the men were picked up in the Bronx of Tuesday and the other was released to the police after being treated for a bullet wound following Monday's incident.

One of the men, Jason Polanco, is believed to have been the shooter, and was apprehended while trying to flee the city.
