Police have discovered the mummified body of an elderly woman being kept in the same bed her daughter was sleeping in.

The grisly discovery was made after neighbours because suspicious about not having seen the 83-year-old for some time.

After social workers in the district of Blumenau, Munich, were refused entry to the home by the woman's daughter, police and firefighters were called to smash their way in.

The woman's apartment was located in the city suburb of Blumenau, in the German city of Munich (pictured)

Inside they discovered the mummified corpse of the elderly woman in the same bed her 55-year-old daughter slept in, The Local reported.

The 55-year-old told police her mother had died in 2009, meaning she had slept in the bed beside the body for about five years. She was sent away for psychiatric tests.

Earlier this year a New York woman was dubbed the 'real life Pyscho' after she was found to have been living with her mother's corpse for at least a year.

She was also said to be putting it at the dinner table for a dining companion and cuddling next to it at night as she slept.

According to The New York Post, Chava Stirn, 28, was discovered living with the corpse of her 61-year-old mother Susie Rosenthal when emergency services were called to the apartment in Borough Park in response to a complaint of a foul odor.

Stirn was said to be behaving erratically and said she wanted to hurt herself.

Her obsessions had gone so far that, like famous film murder Norman Bates, she even dressed up in her mother's clothes and was wearing the same black shoes and outfit Rosenthal had on when she died.

The deceased's bones were resting on a bed of trash bags in the kitchen when authorities arrived.

It was reported Stirn would often sleep next to the remains on a chair in the kitchen, leaving stacks of paper to cover her twin bed. 

She was apparently a shut-in who lived with her mother while the older woman was still alive and was taken to hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.
