If the idea of spreading jam on your face sounds appealing, then this gadget could be for you.

A Canadian company is offering a novelty toaster that allows the selfie-obsessed to burn their image into their morning slice.

The finished product, which sell for £45 ($75), lightly grills bread to a golden brown, expect for the image outline which is burnt darker.

The selfie toaster lets users burn a picture of themselves onto a slice of bread. Customers send a photo to US-based firm Burnt Impressions and they send back a toaster that will turn out your image every time.

The toaster is being offered by the Vermont Novelty Toaster Corporation that offers a service to personalise the novelty gadget.

Customers upload a picture of themselves to the Danville-based firm Burnt Impressions.

Using PhotoShop and a plasma cutter, their image is transferred onto a metal plate, which is then fitted into the toaster. The toaster is usually ready in around 10 days.

The company's president, Galen Dively says there is no other product like this in the world.

The company, which began by making toasters that printed Jesus into bread in a barn off a dirt road in rural Vermont, had been trying to make this concept an affordable reality for several years 

'This is a first in the novelty toaster world,' he told Reuters.

'Before, setup fees and large minimums effectively limited personalised toasters to larger companies, corporations and individuals with deep pockets. We are creating a whole new market; personalised impressions on toast available to all.'

'We finally acquired the machinery needed to make it happen,' Mr Dively said.

'Gone are the days it cost me £890 ($1,500) just to add one new design to our catalogue. We are now limited only by our creativity.'

All work is done at the company's warehouse in Vermont, and despite a lack of promotion, the selfie toasters are already selling well, Mr Dively claims.

'We immediately got interest and orders,' he revealed. 'The response has been great.'
