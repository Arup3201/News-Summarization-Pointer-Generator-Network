Son, Luke, was 11 years old when he was brutally murdered at cricket practice by his father, Greg Anderson

Her 11-year-old son Luke was brutally murdered at cricket practice by his father, Greg Anderson, last February at Tyabb cricket ground, south-east of Melbourne. Anderson was shot dead by police soon after he killed his son.

Ms Batty described the experience as 'very humbling', saying 'the other people that were also nominated as Australians of the year ... have done incredible work for decades in their own fields.

'So to be chosen among such amazing people is incredulous and I'm really, really thankful', she continued.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott took the stage on the lawns outside of Parliament House in Canberra to announce the Australian of the Year for 2015.

'I am truly honoured. I would like to dedicate this award to my beautiful son Luke. He's the reason I have found my voice and I'm able to be heard,' Ms Batty said after the announcement.

'Whilst we celebrate the wonderful country that we live in today - there remains a serious epidemic across our nation.

'No matter where you live, family violence exists in every pocket of every neighbourhood. Family violence may happen behind closed doors but it needs to be brought out from these shadows and into broad daylight.'

'One in six women have experienced physical or sexual abuse by a current or a former partner, including some of those celebrating with us today.'

She said one in four children and at least one women a week are killed. Ms Batty added that Indigenous women 'experience even greater family violence'.

With these statistics revealed, Ms Batty said they are 'unacceptable' and 'indisputable'.

Ms Batty calls on the government for 'strong leadership' to end family violence and deliver intensive support to those who 'desperately need it'.

'And to the Australian people, look around. Do not ignore what you see and what you know is wrong,' she said.

'Raise the conversation and don't shy away from this uncomfortable topic. We cannot do this without you.

'To the women and children - who are unsafe - in hiding or living in fear - who have changed their names - left their extended families and moved from their communities to find safety - you do not deserve to live a life that is dictated by violence. You are not to blame.

'As the Australian of the year, I am committed to building greater campaigns, to educate and challenge community attitudes.

'I am on a path to expose family violence and to ensure that victims receive the respect, support and safety they deserve. 

'And to Luke, my little man, you did not die in vain and will not be forgotten. You are beside me on this journey and with me every step of the way,' Ms Batty said as she concluded her speech.

Ms Batty's award comes after the death of her son that shocked the country, but the way Ms Batty stoically fronted the media in the wake of the horrendous killing stopped the nation. 

Rosie’s story jolted Australia into recognising that family violence can happen to anyone and she became the voice for many thousands of victims of domestic violence who had until then remained unheard. 

Since her family tragedy Rosie has championed efforts to fight domestic violence, making many media and public speaking appearances to shine a spotlight on the issue and call for systemic changes.

Through her tireless efforts the 52-year-old won the respect and hearts of Australians for her strength of character, and the way in which she has taken her own tragic experience and turned it into a call for change to help save others.

This year’s awards proved to be a historic occasion as women were awarded the top honour in all four award categories - 2015 Australian of the Year, 2015 Young Australian of the Year, 2015 Senior Australian of the Year and 2015 Australia's Local Hero.

Author Jackie French, 61, from the Araluen Valley, NSW, was chosen as Senior Australian of the Year; 21-year-old Drisana Levitzke-Gray, from Balga, Western Australia is deaf but who dedicates herself to helping other deaf people and advocating their human rights claimed Young Australian of the Year; while Juliette Wright, 41, the Founder and CEO of GIVIT, from Camp Mountain, Queensland, was recipient of Australia's Local Hero award.

Ms Batty was nominated for her work as an anti-domestic violence campaigner. Her mission is to highlight the issue in Australia and for systemic changes to be made. 

The 52-year has been a vocal advocate against domestic violence since her young son Luke was beaten to death by his father last February. Her composed and courageous response after the horrific killing touched many people. 

Ms Batty believed the unimaginable tragedy set in motion a chain of events that gave her the drive to help the many families struggling daily with domestic violence. 

Through her tireless efforts she won the respect and hearts of Australians for her strength of character 

'I guess what I tapped into was a strength I’ve always had - to be articulate, to stand up for myself and what I believe,' she explained. 

Ms Batty faced competition for the award from movie star Hugh Jackman’s wife Deborra-Lee Furness, who had been nominated for her work as an adoption advocate. 

She intends to keep fighting for victims of family violence. 

‘From an extraordinary group of finalists, all of whom are inspirational Australians and great ambassadors for their home states and territories, we have four Award recipients who stand as role models to us all,’ Chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith VC, MG, said.

‘It is a great moment in the 55 year history of these Awards to honour four women.

‘Rosie, Jackie, Drisana and Juliette remind us of the many ways in which women contribute to our nation - that women are a force for change, a voice for rights, influencers, educators and the heart of our communities.

‘Most of all, they are admired and respected by their fellow Australians - they are people we can be proud of and look to as examples of the good in us all.’
