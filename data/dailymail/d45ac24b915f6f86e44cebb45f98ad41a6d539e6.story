Two young brothers who were miraculously rescued from shifting ice on an Iowa river returned from a TV interview about their ordeal to find their house burgled.

Corbin and Dylan Crawford, aged 12 and seven, had travelled with their mother and a local fire-fighter to New York on Monday to appear on the Today Show.

When the Crawfords returned to their home in Fort Dodge, Iowa, it had been ransacked by burglars who had taken everything, including their clothes and toys.

The criminals took valuables as well as personal items of the two young brothers such as clothes, games and toys.

The Fort Dodge police called the crime â€™disturbingly disappointing if not disgusting,' WhoTV.com reported.

Corbin and Dylan hit the headlines last week when local firefighters saved then after they got stuck on the ice in the Des Moines River and managed to escape unharmed.

A rescue operation was put into play using rope and a boat that was able to get the pair back to dry land after they landed in the slippery situation.

The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon near Hydro Electric Park after the boys walked onto the ice near the park's boat ramp, the Fort Dodge Messenger reported.

A witness said the boys panicked when the ice started shifting.

They eventually got about 75 feet from the west bank of the river and about 300 feet north of the Hydroelectric Dam.

They huddled with one another as help arrived.

The rescue, which took about 45 minutes, involved firefighters throwing rope at the boys in order to send them life jackets.

A firefighter in a flotation suit went onto the ice with the brothers. Another went into the icy water.

The firefighters helped get a flat-bottomed aluminum boat to the boys, which they used to pull them to shore.

The boat's light weight helped reduce the chances of it breaking through the ice.

The brothers were hugged by their mother once they reached solid ground.

They were examined at the scene but did not require hospitalization.

'One of the guys here got a message saying they're home and enjoying some hot chocolate and that they learned their lessons for the day,' Fire Department Capt. Paul Neeson said later Thursday.
