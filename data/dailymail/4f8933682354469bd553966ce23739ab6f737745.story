The original Batmobile is to go under the hammer for the first time, 47 years after its designer built it from an old Lincoln Futura - that he bought for $1.

American car customiser George Barris transformed the banger into the sleek black vehicle that starred in the legendary film and TV series in 1966.

Now the 87-year-old, who has owned it ever since, has decided to sell the caped crusader’s company car - which he today called the 'most valuable car in the world'.

The 'most valuable car in the world': George Barris (pictured) has decided to sell the original Batmobile 47 years after he built it from an old Lincoln Futura

It will be auctioned off by Barrett Jackson on January 19 at its sale in Scottsdale, Arizona with both auction house and owner tight-lipped on the car’s reserve.

However both parties expect the 19ft long piece of automotive history will sell for 'multiple millions'.

The Batmobile started out as a 1955 Lincoln Futura which Barris bought from Ford in 1965 for a nominal $1.

He then spent 15 days and $15,000 transforming the concept car into the one-of-a-kind Batmobile to be driven by actor Adam West.

Appealing: The Batmobile (pictured with Adam West as Batman) uses a V8 engine and automatic gearbox. It's unmistakeable design and famous history will appeal to collectors

Making history: Adam West, in full Batman costume, drives the original Batmobile, which is really a 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car weighing nearly three tons

George said yesterday: 'I think it is 
the most valuable car in the world and the public really get a kick out 
of it when they see it.

'I 
designed and built the Batmobile and I have shown it all around the 
world but now I think it is time that someone else can enjoy it.

'Over
the years I have built many cars and I always get attached to them and 
it will be sad to see it go but I would like someone else to enjoy it 
now.

'When I created it I wanted to make it a star like Adam West and Burt Ward. It was not just a car.'

The Batmobile uses a V8 engine and 
automatic gearbox but it is its unmistakable design and famous history 
which will appeal to collectors.

And if it sells for the £2 million Barrett Jackson hopes, it will rank among TV and film’s most valuable cars.

The
Aston Martin DB5 driven by Sean Connery’s James Bond in Goldfinger sold
at a London auction in 2010 for £2.6 million while the Ford GT40 used 
by Steve McQueen in 1971 film Le Mans fetched £6.5 million earlier this 
year.

Dream team: Adam West, and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin in the Batmobile. Mr Barris spent 15 days and $15,000 transforming the concept car

Craig Jackson, chairman and CEO of Barrett-Jackson, said: 'The Batmobile is true Americana and it’s hard to put a dollar figure on something like that.

'The difference is that this is the real deal, the original and the only one to have been on the Batman series - it’s been in George Barris’ garage for all these years and that is invaluable.

'This vehicle not only marks the significant Bat logo that sits on the middle of its door, but a time in television history where they defied the odds of making a car the real star of the show.

'It revolutionised an entire industry that followed in its footsteps and we couldn’t be prouder to have it cross our block in Scottsdale as it goes up for sale for the very first time.

'We expect plenty of enthusiasts and fans to come out and wouldn’t be surprised if the car sold for multiple millions.'
