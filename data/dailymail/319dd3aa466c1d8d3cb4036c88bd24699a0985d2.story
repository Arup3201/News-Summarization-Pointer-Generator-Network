An innocent family has been left stunned after heavily armed police raided their home looking for a previous tenant that they suspected of committing drug offences.

Jeremy and Becky Handley, and their two children Aurora, eight, and Brenden, seven, were convinced they were about to be robbed when the gun-wielding group burst into their home in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Officers ransacked drawers and cabinets in the property and forced Mr Handley to lay on the ground with his hands behind his back, before eventually realising that the man they were looking for - a suspected drug dealer known as 'Chum' - had not lived at the address for more than a year.

Jeremy Handley and his wife Becky (pictured) were handcuffed and forced to lay on the ground while Kalamazoo police officers conducted a three-hour search of their home, hunting for cocaine and drug money

Kalamazoo police sent a SWAT team to the family home to search for cocaine, drug money and weapons last Thursday afternoon, but instead found only the terrified Handley family.

Aurora and her younger brother Brenden ran to hide in a wardrobe in their bedroom as the police smashed down the front door of the property. She told WWMT that the ordeal made her 'sad and scared'.

'We were staying quiet because we thought they were bad guys coming in,' Brenden added.

When officers eventually found the children, they were forced to sit on a bed while their parents were handcuffed in front of them.

Wrong: During the search Jeremy Handley (left) was told that officers were looking for 'a man named Chum'. After realising the suspected drug dealer moved out last year, the police apologised to Becky Handley (right)

The investigators then conducted a three-hour search of the property but, unsurprisingly, found nothing untoward. They later handed the family a report confirming nothing had been discovered.

During the search Mr Handley was told by officers that they were looking for 'a man named Chum', before adding that he would 'never recognize him if I were to see him in the street'.

After realising the man they were looking for had moved out last year, the police apologised to Mrs Handley and gave the children cuddly toys as gifts.

Broken: Mr Handley now hopes the police will pay for his traumatised children to have counselling, as well as come up with the money for a new front door (pictured)

Kalamazoo police declined to comment on the raid at the family home (pictured), saying it was part of an ongoing investigation. However it is understood that the local chief of police intends to contact the family

The presents have done little to stop the
 children's nightmares over the ordeal however, with Aurora explaining: 
'One dream was about Chum coming in our house with a gun, saying â€˜get on
 the ground''.
