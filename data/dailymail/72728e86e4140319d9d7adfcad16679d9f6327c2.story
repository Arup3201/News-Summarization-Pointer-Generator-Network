It is not for the faint hearted - a Hamas-run summer camp for school kids to take part in gruelling physical activities, military exercises and political demonstrations.

Thousands of Palestinian students have gathered to take part in the brutal summer camps, organised by the political organisation Hamas, in the Southern Gaza Strip.

Photos from the camps show children climbing obstacles above open flames, running in formation and standing at attention.

They also include political demonstrations for the students to show their solidarity for Palestinian prisoners currently held in Israeli jails.

Some countries and organisations, including Israel, the United States and the European Union, classify Hamas as a terrorist organisation, while others, including many Arab states, do not.

The summer camps are taking place in the Southern Gaza Strip with thousands of school kids expected to attend the military exercises and training activities

The physically draining summer camps are organised and run by Hamas, a Palestinian political group which is considered a terrorist organisation by some countries

These Palestinian boys, covered in dirt and soot, were photographed taking part in a physical military exercise yesterday, in an area called Rafah, in Southern Gaza

The activities the students participate in includes physical exercise, with many pictures showing obstacles to be overcome while avoiding open fires and other hazards

The Gaza Strip has been controlled by political organisation Hamas since 2007 following violent clashes with rival Fatah and a majority victory in the Palestinian elections

Students at the summer camps will also take part in political demonstrations during their stay, to show solidarity with fellow Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails

Many of the activities are variations of what you would find on a normal obstacle course, but with added challenges, such as dodging open flames or barbed wire

The formation of a unity government in Palestine was announced only weeks ago, following the April reconciliation deal agreed between Fatah and Hamas

The students take part in their training courses in often sweltering hot weather - making the physical activities all the more demanding
