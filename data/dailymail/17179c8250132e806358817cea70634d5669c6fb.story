Vice President Joe Biden has taken the Internet by storm after releasing a comedy video to support Michelle Obama's #GimmeFive campaign to encourage people to lead active and healthy lifestyles.

In the video, posted on Vine by the White House on Friday, the 72-year-old politician is filmed performing arm curls with a dumbbell while apparently talking on the phone with 'world leaders'.

Donning a white skirt, a striped tie and black pants, he can be heard saying, 'Yeah, yeah', on the phone. He then turns to the camera and says: 'I do a million of these a day. So, just give me five.'

The video was uploaded alongside the caption: 'A million arm curls. Calls with world leaders. All in a day's work.' It was later circulated on Twitter and Instagram, with some users deeming it 'priceless'.

'All in a day's work': The video was posted on Vine by the White House on Friday, alongside the caption: 'A million arm curls. Calls with world leaders. All in a day's work.' It was later circulated on Twitter and Instagram

Twitter user Clarke Berry wrote: 'That Instagram video of Joe Biden doing arm curls while on the phone is what I've been waiting for my entire life.' Scott Haavisto labelled the footage 'amazing'. 

Meanwhile, user Olivia Bergemann, who lives in Branford, New Haven County, Connecticut, said: 'The fact that Joe Biden just put up a video of him doing bicep curls is priceless #theBroVP.'

And Bud Sheppard, from New Orleans, tweeted a clip from the video, remarking: 'This is hilarious.'

The footage was released by the White House - and subsequently shared  by Biden's office and hundreds of others online - to mark the fifth anniversary of Mrs Obama's 'Let's Move!' program.

The 51-year-old's #GimmeFive campaign - part of the initiative 'to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation' - challenges people to list five ways they are living a healthy lifestyle.

Earlier on Friday, FLOTUS had tweeted the Vice President: 'Hey @VP: Ready to join the workout? #GimmeFive of your best reps and pass on the challenge' - a request he then quickly fulfilled.

Other famous figures to have completed the challenge so far include singer Beyonce, who posted a video of herself working out to Survivor's Eye of the Tiger while sporting a form-fitting black T-shirt.

In the video, the 33-year-old, who was also donning black and white sneakers, participated in five different workouts, including standing crunches, deep lunges and cardio on a workout bench.

Radio personality Ryan Seacrest has also completed the challenge. He uploaded a video of himself doing burpees to his Twitter page, writing that he was 'passing on' the challenge to Nick Jonas. 

It comes as Mrs Obama has displayed her dance moves to promote #GimmeFive during a toe-curling appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which will air on US television on Monday.

'We’re asking folks all across the country to #GimmeFive ways they're leading a healthy life,' the mother-of-two told DeGeneres during the program. 'We’ve got a lot of celebrities involved.' 

She then launched into an energetic dance routine to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' 'Uptown Funk' alongside DeGeneres and a number of other dancers, while the audience cheered and applauded. 

Mrs Obama also revealed she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to Uptown Funk in front of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll.

This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children.

Although egg hunts are no longer part of the event, children are still invited for egg rolling on the lawn and a slap-up afternoon tea.  Among the children to attend this year will be Mrs Obama and President Barack Obama's daughters Sasha, 14, and Malia, 17, who will have a ringside view.
