A social worker left papers containing sexual abuse allegations in a plastic bag on a train in one of a series of data breaches at councils that have cost £1.9million in fines.

The London Borough of Lewisham was fined £70,000 after the employee mislaid documents, which included GP and police reports and allegations of abuse and neglect, when taking them home.

Leeds City Council was fined almost £100,000 
after trying to save money by reusing envelopes - and then sending personal information about a child in care to the wrong person.

Plymouth City Council was hit with a 
£60,000 penalty for another incident in which reports on two families 
were mixed up after they were sent to a shared printer - bringing the total number of councils charged for Data Protection Act breaches to 19.

A Devon County Council worker revealed the details of the alleged criminal offences and health problems of 22 people while compiling a report for an adoption panel. The council was fined £90,000 penalty for the mistake.

Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'It would be far too easy to consider these breaches as simple human error.

'The reality is that they are caused by councils treating sensitive personal data in the same routine way they would deal with more general correspondence.'

The case in Leeds saw sensitive personal details about a child in care sent to the wrong person, disclosing details of a criminal offence, school attendance, the level of contact agreed with siblings and information about the child's relationship with their mother.

The document was delivered to the wrong place because the council were re-using envelopes internally after they had been used for external mail, and the original address had not been crossed out.

Leeds City Council chief executive Tom Riordan said: 'We take our data protection responsibilities seriously and regard any breach as unacceptable.

'We accept the findings of the Information Commissioner and although we have already apologised to the individual affected we would like to take this opportunity to do so again.'

The breach at Plymouth City Council saw the wrong person receive information including highly sensitive personal details about two parents and four children.

The breach occurred when two reports about separate child neglect cases were sent to the same shared printer.

In Devon, a social worker used a previous case as a template for an adoption panel report they were writing, but a copy of the old report was sent out instead of the new one.

The mistake disclosed personal data of 22 people, including details of alleged criminal offences and mental and physical health.

Mr Graham added: 'Far too often in these cases, the councils do not appear to have acknowledged that the data they are handling is about real people, and often the more vulnerable members of society.

'The distress that these incidents would have caused to the people involved is obvious.'

The Information Commissioner's Office said it was pressing the Ministry of Justice for stronger powers to audit local councils' data protection compliance, if necessary without consent.
