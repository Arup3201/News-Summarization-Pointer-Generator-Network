Half of workers in some areas are earning less than the so-called living wage, new research reveals.

Unions warned working families were facing the biggest squeeze on their finances since Victorian times, with many not earning enough to live on.

The living wage used by increasing numbers of employers pays £8.80 in London and £7.65 across the rest of the UK, but a new map reveals in many areas workers are paid much less.

The research by the TUC reveals the areas were almost half of people earn less than the minimum wage of £8.80 in London and £7.65 across the rest of the UK

London Mayor Boris Johnson has been a leading supporter of the living wage, which is well above the government-set minimum wage which will hit £6.50 from October.

A new analysis of wages by the TUC to mark the 15th anniversary of the introduction of the minium wage reveals how much pay levels vary across the country.

Nationwide around 5million people earn less than the living wage.

A league table of ‘black spots’ is stopped by Kingswood near Bristol where 48 per cent of people working are paid less than £7.65 an hour.

Next on the list is Chingford and Woodford Green in North East London (43.4 per cent), Harrow West in North West London (42.4 per cent) and Sefton Central on Merseyside (40.4 per cent).

The TUC said the picture was even worse for women, with more than half earning less than the living wage in Kingswood (56.1 per cent) and Bexleyheath and Crayford (51.3) per cent.

TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady warned working families were facing the biggest squeeze on their finances since Victorian times, with many not earning enough to live on

TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Extending the living wage is a vital way of tackling the growing problem of in-work poverty across Britain.

‘Working families are experiencing the biggest pressure on their living standards since Victorian times.

‘Pay has been squeezed at all levels below the boardroom and it’s costing our economy dear.’

While the minimum wage is the legal minimum firms must pay, employers choose to pay the higher living wage voluntarily. The rate is set independently and reviewed every year. The Tories, Labour and Lib Dems have all backed it.

Miss O’Grady added: ‘The number of living wage employers is growing rapidly and unions are playing their part in encouraging more employers to sign up and pay it – but government must show equal initiative.

‘We need to see a far greater commitment to pay the living wage from government and employers, and modern wages councils which could set higher minimum rates in industries where employers can afford to pay their staff more.’

While some areas are dominated by low paid jobs, others pay well above the living wage.

Just 5.6 per cent of people working in Poplar and Limehouse (East London) earn less than the living wage followed by 5.8 per cent in Runnymede and Weybridge (Surrey), 7.3 per cent in South Cambridgeshire and also 7.3 per cent in Islington South and Finsbury (North London).

 A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: ‘The Government continues to support employers that choose to pay the Living Wage. However, decisions on what wages are set at is for employees and employers to agree so long as it is above the National Minimum Wage (NMW).

‘Each year the NMW is recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission and this is set as the highest possible rate which will not damage employment prospects.

‘We have however asked them to look at how we could restore the real value of the NMW as the economy recovers.

‘Their new forward guidance gives us a much better understanding of how an economic recovery can be translated into faster and significant increases in the NMW for low paid workers, without costing jobs.'
