The RSPCA carried out 200,000 rescues last year many of which really took the biscuit - including a dog who got stuck in a plug hole.

Hapless Yorkshire Terrier Emma got her paw wedged down a plug hole after a bath and it took RSPCA officers more than half-an-hour to get her free.

The animal charity rescued an incredible 195,000 animals from a variety of situations, including a kitten that was stuck in a wall for five days, and a deer trapped in a football net.

Terrier Emma was rescued in what may well be the most bizarre operation of the year.

Inspector
Jennie Ronksley said: 'Little Emma was stuck for over half an hour and 
was clearly in pain as she yelped constantly whilst we tried to free 
her.

'The bath was taken apart and eventually the dog’s foot along with the plug hole was removed from the bath.

'There was a happy ending but this is one of the more unusual rescues I’ve had.'

Animal protection officers are called 
in to save stricken animals on a daily basis, including one cat that had
its head firmly wedged in a food tin.

A mouse stuck in a toaster was also saved by the RSPCA after the owner heard squeaks as she was about to put her toast in.

And there was a ginger kitten - since re-named Macavity - discovered inside the walls of a flat in Liskeard, Cornwall.

The tiny kitten was only six-weeks-old and weighed less than a chocolate bar when it was hauled out of the cavity.

Animal Welfare Officer Felicity Cross 
said: 'What was even more surprising is that we undertook a thorough 
search of the property, including the loft, and we couldn’t find any 
sign of the mother or any other kittens.

'There was absolutely no indication of how Macavity got there. He really is a mystery cat.'

The
animal charity will launch their latest campaign ‘Everyday Heroes’ in 
two weeks’ time, to highlight the dangers facing many animals and the 
workers who try to protect them.

RSPCA
national flood rescue co-ordinator Jason Finch said: 'From gas 
explosions to oil spills and floods to strange and unusual rescues like a
dog in plughole - our officers are trained to be able to deal with any 
situation

'Bringing 
animals to safety and reuniting pets and farm animals with their 
grateful owners, as well as seeing wildlife re-released into their 
natural habitat, is one of the best parts of the job.'
