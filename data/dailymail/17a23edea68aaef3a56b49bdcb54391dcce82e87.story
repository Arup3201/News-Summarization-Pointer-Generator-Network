Kellie Maloney stopped breathing during facial reconstruction surgery and was kept alive on an emergency respirator

Kellie Maloney stopped breathing for more than an hour during facial reconstruction surgery and was kept alive on an emergency respirator, it has been reported.

Transsexual Maloney, formerly known as boxing promoter Frank Maloney and who is now 18 months into a transition period to change gender, is believed to have suffered a heart murmur triggered by a reaction to the anaesthetic she was placed under.

Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, had announced that her final operation was booked for January 13.

But The Sun reports that medics have now cancelled the genital and breast surgery to complete her transition, warning that it is too dangerous.

A source told the paper: 'She can't go ahead with the sex change now. She's in utter turmoil.'

Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. 

Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change.

Kellie has already received hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling.

She was scheduled to have an operation that will involve 'the realignment of her male genitalia to become female genitalia' as well as having breast implants - which doctors said could be up to a B or a C cup.

Maloney had travelled to Belgium 11 days ago to undergo facial surgery, but she is said to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic which meant she could not breathe on her own for a number of hours. 

The operation involved nose augmentation, cheek fillers and an eye-lift.  

She has since returned home and is said to be recovering with her family in Maidstone, Kent.  

Before coming out as a transgender female, Kellie was better known as international boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who took Lennox Lewis to become the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the world. 

Earlier this year she shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman. 

Ahead of her surgery, Kellie told Lorraine Kelly that she wanted to have her nose made slightly smaller. 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big,' she said.

'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.'

She added: 'I am living really well now, I am pleased that the public are really good to me and my daughters are great. The operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then I can start living my life properly.

'Most of my friends are retiring but I am living life all over again.'

Kellie is also sharing her story and supporting others within her support group, talking at events and helping other transgender people.

She even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too. 

'At least it will stop me shopping,' she joked. 

MailOnline has contacted Ms Maloney's representatives for comment.
