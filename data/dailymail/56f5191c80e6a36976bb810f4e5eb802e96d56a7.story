Shock: Kirsty Tierney-Jones was given a parking fine despite driving to the A&E with severe pain and bleeding while pregnant with baby Alice-Neve

A pregnant woman who drove herself to A&E when she though she was losing the second of her twin babies has been fined for parking at the hospital without a ticket.

Kirsty Tierney-Jones, 33, rushed to Queen's Hospital in Romford at 5am on October 18 with severe pain and bleeding after falling over at home while 38 weeks pregnant.

Despite suffering the same symptoms that had already claimed the life of one of her twin babies 24 weeks earlier, Mrs Tierney-Jones, from Hornchurch in Essex, was given a parking ticket and threatened with court action if she did not pay out.

Upon arriving at the hospital by herself at 5am, Mrs Tierney-Jones was helped from her car and into A&E by an elderly couple.

She left her vehicle in a space at the flagship hospital’s car park, but there was no time for her to purchase a ticket from a pay-and-display machine.

Mrs Tierney-Jones had been struck down by hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes nausea and vomiting, and which had already claimed the life of one of her twins at just 14 weeks.

It was the same devastating condition suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge, who was taken into hospital at the beginning of her pregnancy with Prince George.

Mrs Tierney-Jones, who lost a stone-and-a-half as she battled the illness, later gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Alice-Neve.

But she was shocked to receive a £75 parking fine several weeks after her terrifying visit to A&E.

Mrs Tierney-Jones appealed to Gemini Parking Solutions, which runs the hospital’s parking payments system, on January 23 of this year.

But the company initially refused to waive the fine and even threatened to take legal action against her if she did not make the payment.

Mrs Tierney-Jones said: 'It’s absolutely disgusting - my child’s life was at risk and they still want to fine me.'

'My baby could have died... I had already lost her sibling', she added.

She went on to say: 'It would have been different if it was an appointment but this was an emergency.'

A spokesman Gemini Parking Solutions claims the company has since cancelled the parking ticket after local newspaper The Romford Recorder intervened on her behalf.

The practice of charging hospital patients for car parking has long been controversial.

Branded a 'tax on the sick' by campaigners, many hospitals rake in millions of pounds in profit every year, with a study by the Health and Social Care Information Centre last year finding some NHS organisations charge almost three times the national average for non-hospital parking spaces.

Some of the worst affected by parking charges are people who have to visit hospitals regularly, including cancer patients, those with sick children and people visiting relatives in intensive care.

Although it is down to each individual hospital to set its own charges, the NHS explicitly advises them to offer 'fair and appropriate concessions' for patients forced to pay disproportionate sums.

However some hospitals, including the Royal Free London Foundation Trust, the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital Foundation Trust and the Countess of Chester Hospital Foundation Trust are still charging patients a base rate of £3-an-hour to park, rising much higher when the stay is for several hours or days.

According to its website, Queen's Hospital in Romford, where Mrs Tierney-Jones had treatment, charges patients £1.20 an hour, rising to £18 to stay in its multi-storey car park for 12 hours.

Disabled blue badge holders are allowed to park for free outside the main entrance when displaying their permit, but they too must pay to park in the multi-storey car park.

There are, however, concessions for people visiting the hospital if they are visiting a relative who is expected to die, next-of-kins or birthing partners visiting a labour ward, or inpatients facing treatment for either less than seven days, or for between 14 and 21 days.

Cancer patients visiting the hospital regularly for treatment have to pay for parking, but they may be reimbersed at a later date at the discretion of a matron or senior sister.
