Target has revealed that a sales assistant's stolen credentials helped cyber criminals pull off a massive theft of customer data during the Christmas shopping season last year.

Around 40 million credit and debit card details and 70 million other private records were stolen by hackers accessing the US retailers' payment system using an unidentified vendor's details.

The disclosure of how the criminals were able to pull off the crime comes as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed that the Department of Justice was investigating the massive hacking at Target.

Hacked: Target, the third biggest retailer in the U.S., has revealed that cyber criminals stole a sales assistant's credentials to pull off the massive theft of up to 70 million customers' personal details

Molly Snyder, a spokesman for Target - the third largest retailer in the U.S., said: 'The ongoing forensic investigation has 
indicated that the intruder stole a vendor's credentials, which were 
used to access our system.'

She declined to elaborate on what type of credentials were taken, who the vendor was, or to provide other details.

Last week personal data stolen from Target customers in South Texas was found in the possession 
of a pair of Mexican citizens arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border, but 
investigators believe the original hackers will be far more difficult to
 locate.

The new details of the hack came as Attorney General
 Eric Holder confirmed that the Department of Justice had launched an investigation into the crime.

Holder,
 testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said the Justice 
Department would seek the perpetrators of the Target breach as well as 
'any individuals and groups who exploit that data via credit card 
fraud.'

'While we generally
 do not discuss specific matters under investigation, I can confirm the 
department is investigating the breach involving the U.S. retailer, 
Target,' Holder added.

Yesterday U.S. spy chiefs called on Congress to draft stricter requirements for how retailers and other private businesses should inform government agencies and customers about big breaches of personal and financial data.

At a hearing before the Senate 
Intelligence Committee, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, where the National
 Security Agency is headquartered, asked intelligence chiefs if media 
leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden had affected U.S. 
cybersecurity efforts.

'Is 
the impact of the Snowden affair slowing us down in our work to be more 
aggressive in the cybersecurity area?' Mikulski asked.

FBI Director James Comey said 
political uproar over surveillance and Snowden's leaks had complicated 
discussions about how to fight consumer data breaches.

'There is the threat of fraud and theft because we've connected our lives to the Internet,' Comey said.

'We
 need to make sure that the private sector knows the rules of the road 
and how we share that information with the government.'

Leaks by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden have 'complicated' the fight against data breaches

Some U.S. officials with 
responsibility for cybersecurity have complained privately that, while 
states have created a 'patchwork' of local rules requiring businesses to
 report breaches of consumer data to authorities and the public, there 
are no similar nationwide federal requirements.

Congress
 has been wrestling for years with proposals for legislation on data 
security but has been unable to reach agreement. There is no national 
standard to govern how and when businesses that suffer consumer data 
breaches must advise their customers and federal agencies.

The Secret Service has taken the lead
 investigating the breaches at Target and other retailers, including 
Neiman Marcus and Michaels Companies Inc, the largest U.S. arts and 
crafts retailer.

On January
 23 it was reported that the FBI also warned U.S. retailers to prepare 
for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases over the
 past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used 
against Target during the holiday shopping season.

As lawmakers accelerated to gather 
information about the data breaches, Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democratic
 chairman of the Judiciary Committee, took a new tack, asking Target why
 the company had not yet reported its data breach to the U.S. Securities
 and Exchange Commission.

'Your
 failure thus far to provide this information to your investors does not
 seem consistent with the spirit or the letter of the SEC's financial 
disclosure rules,' Rockefeller wrote in the three-page letter to 
Target's chief executive Gregg Steinhafel.

The company's shares have been hurt since the data breach was announced on December 19.

Target closed at $56.89 per share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, down 1.7 per cent, after reaching its lowest level since July 2012.
