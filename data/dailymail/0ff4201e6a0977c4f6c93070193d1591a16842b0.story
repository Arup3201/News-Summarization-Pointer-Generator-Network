'It's truly heartbreaking to hear about something happening like this and my thoughts are with him, his family and his friends,' the DJ told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'I'm against violence in any capacity and incidents like this are exactly why,' he said.

The NSW government introduced new 'one punch' laws for unlawful assault, which came into effect on in January 2014.

The sentence carries a 20 year maximum sentence for anyone who 'unlawfully assaults another who dies as a direct or indirect result of the assault,' said Government's website set up for the introduction of the laws.
