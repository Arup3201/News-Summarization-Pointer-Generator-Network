It’s the toughest and most exclusive Double in world football – winning the Champions League and World Cup in the same year.

Since 1992 when the European Cup changed to its current format, only two players have achieved it out of thousands who have tried.

Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid and France 1998) and Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid and Brazil, 2002) are the pair who made history, but others will try to take the first step to joining them when Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid play in the Champions League final in Lisbon on May 24.

Path to glory: Christian Karembeu was part of the France side that beat Brazil 3-0 in the 1998 World Cup final

Heart-breaker: Roberto Carlos takes a free-kick as Brazil beat England 2-1 in the 2002 World Cup quarter-final

Four years
 ago, Wesley Sneijder came very close, winning the Champions League with
 Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan before and reaching the World Cup final, 
which his Holland team lost to Spain.

Xabi Alonso’s hopes of a double were ruined by his suspension for Saturday’s final but there are others who dare to dream.

THE ODDS ON WINNING THE WORLD CUP AND CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

11/2 - MARCELO (Real Madrid and Brazil)

Of all the star names still in the running, Marcelo  is the only one who can claim to play for both market leaders Real Madrid and Brazil.

His biggest task will be nailing down a place at left-back. He faces tough competition from Fabio Coentrao with Real, and Maxwell for Brazil.

In with a shout: Brazilian Marcelo vies for the ball against teammate Gareth Bale during Friday's training

8/1 - ANGEL DI MARIA (Real Madrid and Argentina)

Has come good in the second half of the season to earn a place in the Real side. Argentina manager Alex Sabella, who is also spoilt for choice, will take him to the World Cup.

He’s got the unique joy of setting up chances for Ronaldo for his club, and Messi for his country.

Coming of age: Angel Di Maria's form has been vital in helping Real Madrid reaching the Champions League final

8/1 - SAMI KHEDIRA (Real Madrid and Germany)

Missed five months of the season with a knee injury but has timed his return to perfection. Would be a football fairytale if he emerged from the treatment room to win the two biggest trophies in the game.

Alonso’s suspension gives him a better chance of playing in Lisbon on Saturday.

Slice of luck: Sami Khedira may start in Lisbon after Xabi Alonso was ruled out through suspension

10/1 - IKER CASILLAS and SERGIO RAMOS (Real Madrid  and Spain)

The pair were all part of  Spain’s World Cup-winning team in 2010 and expect to go to Brazil this summer.

Casillas is out of favour in La Liga but he’s the man to turn to for big occasions, Spain’s captain and holder of three Champions League winners’ medals.

Dani Carvajal also plays for Real and Spain but is less likely to feature.

Leading man: Iker Casillas has dropped down the pecking order at Real Madrid in the last couple of seasons

11/1 – JOSE SOSA (Atletico Madrid and Argentina)

A right-winger whose loan move from Metallist Kharkiv to Atletico in January couldn’t have worked out any better with a La Liga title already in the bag and maybe more to follow.

Unlikely hero: Jose Sosa (left) tackles Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez as Atletico pipped Barca to the league title

15/1 JUANFRAN, DAVID VILLA, KOKE AND DIEGO COSTA (Atletico Madrid and Spain)

Costa is going to get a hostile reception in his home country of Brazil having chosen to play international football for his adopted Spain.

But he won’t care if he arrives as the La Liga and Champions League winner with Atletico. Injury threatens his appearance in Lisbon though.

On the verge of greatness: Striker Diego Costa (far right) was pivotal in Atletico's capture of the league title

33/1 - KARIM BENZEMA AND RAPHAEL VARANE (Real Madrid and France)

Being  left out of France’s 2010 World Cup squad didn’t do him any harm because the campaign ended in a players’ ‘strike’ and early exit.

Since then he’s been scoring goals in bucketloads for Real. Varane is rated the best young centre-half in the world.

New lease: Karim Benzema had scored 22 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid this season

35/1 - CRISTIANO RONALDO, FABIO COENTRAO AND PEPE (Real Madrid and Portugal)

If Ronaldo can pull off the Double and help Portugal win the World Cup, he’ll leapfrog Lionel Messi as the greatest player of his generation and possibly Pele and Diego Maradona as the greatest of all-time as well. Pepe is among the best defenders in the world.

Unstoppable: Cristiano Ronaldo defies gravity as he controls the ball during Madrid's match against Bayern Munich

40/1 – THIBAUT COURTOIS AND TOBY ALDERWEIRELD (Atletico Madrid and Belgium)

Courtois will leave Chelsea embarrassed if he ends up with one major trophy, let alone two, as they have allowed him to stay in Spain on loan.

66/1  - DIEGO GODIN, CHRISTIAN RODRIGUEZ AND JOSE MARIA GIMINEZ (Atletico Madrid and Uruguay)

Even if they pull off a surprise on Saturday, Luis Suarez’s injury diminishes their World Cup prospects.

250/1 – LUKA MODRIC (Real Madrid and Croatia)

He will pull the strings for Real in the Champions League final but it’ll be a miracle if he’ll emerge triumphant in Brazil this summer, particularly with Croatia facing the host nation first.

Old friends: Luca Modric and Gareth Bale were teammates at Tottenham before finding their way to Madrid
