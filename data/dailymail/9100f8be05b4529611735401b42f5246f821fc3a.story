Grinding his hips from side-to-side and shimmying his chest, this is the moment a high school teacher from Texas shows his students how to groove to the rhythm.

Scot Pankey from A. Maceo Smith New Tech High School in Dallas, decided to lead a dance around campus recently with Mark Ronson's hit single Uptown Funk being the track of choice.

Wearing skin-tight grey pants and a black shirt, he puts on a high-energy performance for the camera as students follow his choreographed moves.

As the lyrics 'I’m too hot, make a dragon wanna retire, man,' sound, Pankey fans his face with one hand.

He then wipes his brow before jigging through corridors with the rest of his entourage in tow.

As the track nears the end, dozens of students have joined the performance all mimicking the same moves.
