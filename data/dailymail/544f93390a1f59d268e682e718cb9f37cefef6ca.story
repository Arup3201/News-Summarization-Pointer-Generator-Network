The age old belief that people living on the West Coast of the United States are more relaxed and creative than those living in the east is now scientifically proven, following a 13 year study to map the moods of America.

Researchers led by psychologist Jason Rentfrow, an American now working at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., analysed personality test data from over one million people to identify three distinct personality regions.

They found people living in north eastern states tended to be temperamental and uninhibited, while those living along the West Coast were more creative and relaxed.

Meanwhile people living in the central and southern region were found to be more friendly and conventional.

The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, collected data from over 1.6 million people over a 13-year period.

The respondents were recruited by a range of methods including websites, advertising in the academic community and even social media platforms such as Facebook.

They were given a choice of taking one of three different personality surveys, including one known as the the Big Five Inventory.

This test was designed to measure a personality according to five key criteria -Â  Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.

And it was the results of this Big Five test threw up some of the most intriguing results. Utah was found to be the the most agreeable place in the country with Washington, D.C., the least.

And Utah was also determined to be the least neurotic place in the U.S., while West Virginia was found to be the most.

If you live in Wisconsin you're likely to be an extrovert while but if you live in chilly Vermont, you're more likely to keep things to yourself.

Hard-working South Carolina came top for conscientiousness, while it appears the people of Maine take a more relaxed attitude. Washington DC, was found to be the most open place - despite also being the least agreeable - while North Dakota finished bottom for openness.

Professor Rentfrow told Time magazine: 'Political values may exaggerate the temperamental differences and a sense of tribalism may emerge.

'But these things all come from a mix of common personality types. The Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic may be very different from the Rockies and the West, for example, but openness is a big part of both personality profiles.'
