Fraudster: Jonathan Thompson, 35, has been jailed for four months after completing just one hour of a 100 hour community service order

A convicted fraudster who only completed one hour of a community service order because it made him feel too depressed - has been jailed.

Jonathan Thompson, 35, was given 100 hours of unpaid work after admitting conspiracy to defraud in June last year.

He was part of a group who pretended to order goods online and then claimed refunds from Royal Mail when the phantom parcels were not delivered.

He received the 12-month community sentence after admitting taking part in the scam and allowing his address to be used.

But Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard yesterday that Thompson had only completed one hour of unpaid work after suffering with depression.

Judge Paul Glenn told him he had treated the order with ‘complete contempt’ and re-sentenced him to four months in prison.

He said: 'He is making no attempt whatsoever to deal with this court order.

'He had the shot across the bows in January. He knew what was expected of him. I accept you have some form of depression. So do an awful lot of people.

'The reality is you do not fancy doing some work for nothing. The original offence was serious. You have treated this order with complete contempt. You have willfully and persistently refused to comply with it.'

The court heard the probation service had
 applied for the order to be revoked in January this year, saying it was
 unworkable due to Thompson’s health.

But Recorder Bal Dhaliwal refused to revoke the order and told Thompson, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, to re-engage or risk going to prison.

He breached the order again by failing to report for community service on March 2 and March 16. Defending Thompson, Catherine O’Reilly said he had no previous convictions before he became involved in the Royal Mail conspiracy.

But the court heard he had since assaulted his wife in December last year - for which he received a community order with 18 months supervision. Miss O’Reilly said: 'He is clearly suffering from depression of some form or another.
