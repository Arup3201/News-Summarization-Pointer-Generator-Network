Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has been accused of undermining George Osborne by telling him to cut welfare instead of military spending.

The call for the Chancellor to change his Budget plans made a mockery of Whitehall convention whereby Ministers do not meddle in each other’s departments.

But far from upsetting Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Mr Hammond – now tipped as a future Chancellor – won his strong support.

A supporter of George Osborne told the Mail on Sunday that Mr Hammond was playing a 'dangerous game'

The pair have formed a powerful Right-wing ‘pincer movement’ aided by Home Secretary Theresa May.

‘Iain would love to cut £10 billion from the welfare budget but Nick Clegg keeps vetoing it,’ said a senior Tory.

‘Iain, Philip and Theresa have all made this point powerfully round the Cabinet table, but Osborne won’t face down Clegg.’

Multi-millionaire Mr Hammond’s ‘get your tanks off my lawn’ warning to Mr Osborne follows speculation Right-wing Tory MPs want him to take his place as Chancellor.

But a supporter of Mr Osborne said Mr Hammond – the Chancellor’s deputy before the Election –  was playing a ‘dangerous game’.
