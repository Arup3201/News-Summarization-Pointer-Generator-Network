Offensive: Miami's boss of urban design Enrique D. Nuñez, pictured, has sparked outrage after an offensive email he sent to the rest of the city's planning committee openly mocking Walmart customers was leaked

Miami's boss of urban design has sparked outrage after an offensive email he sent to the rest of the city's planning committee openly mocking Walmart customers was leaked.

Enrique D. Nuñez's email, which appears to be a forwarded newsletter from the classist, at times racist, blog 'People Of Walmart,' features more than a dozen candid photos of obese, tattooed, and questionably-dressed customers of the mega-retailer, which is pushing to build a store in Midtown Miami.

Adding his mark, Nuñez wrote ominously, 'Coming to Midtown' before forwarding the message to planning director Francisco Garcia, chief of community planning Harold Ruck, and four more committee members.

News of the outrageous email, obtained by the Miami New Times, comes the same day council members will decide on Walmart's contentious building application.

The plan to build a Walmart in the center of the city has angered residents, inspired passionate protests and cost a fortune in lobbying and public relations fees.

The email was sent during office hours on March 6, 2013 and the recipients are from the department charged with reviewing and approving Walmart's application.

Under the heading 'The Latest Walmartians!' each image comes with a comment poking fun at customers, many of whom live on low wages and shop at the store because of its cheap prices.

Shocking: The email, pictured with just one of the many offensive photographs, appears to be a forwarded newsletter from the classist, at times racist, blog 'People Of Walmart'

Walmart: The email was sent during office hours on March 6, 2013 and the recipients are from the department charged with reviewing and approving Walmart's application to set up shop in Midtown, shown in artist's impressive above

The first image in the chain shows a 
large black woman whose son is perched on her generous behind. The 
comment states 'This is why they are called "handles."'

The
next image from the blog shows an elderly white woman in a leotard shopping on a 
mobility cart with the comment, 'She lost her pants playing Strip Poker 
on Aisle 3!'

Other pictures mock regrettable tattoos, hairstyles and clothing.

Another candid shot shows two black women wearing 
bathing suits in store with the comment, 'She sat on her probation 
papers before the ink was dry!' referring to a tattoo on one of the 
women's buttocks.

Blog: The 'People of Walmart' blog posts candid pictures, like those left and right, of Walmart shoppers. These images were not in Nuñez's email, though equally offensive ones were

Nationwide: The blog features mainly obese, lower socioeconomic customers who shop at Walmart for the cheap prices. This image was not in Nuñez's email, though equally offensive ones were

Controversial. The plan to build a Walmart in the center of the city has angered residents, inspired passionate protests and cost a fortune in lobbying and public relations fees. This picture wasn't included in the email

Sent on: The email was sent to planning director Francisco Garcia, chief of community planning Harold Ruck, and four more committee members

Vote: News of the outrageous email, obtained by the Miami New Times, comes the same day council members will decide on Walmart's contentious building application

According to the New Times, the message came several weeks after the Urban Design Review Board rejected Walmart's request for a building permit and seven months before the Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board ultimately approved the plan.

The anti-Walmart email will likely upset those fighting against the mega-store's proposal.

They have long claimed the planning department has been too lenient on Walmart, caving to pressure from the retail giant's lobbyists and their fat wallets.

Nuñez has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Walmart's permit application is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday at Miami's city hall.

The March email came several weeks after the Urban Design Review Board rejected Walmart's request for a building permit
