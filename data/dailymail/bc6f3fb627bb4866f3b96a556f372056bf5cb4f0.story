A 27-year-old Oregon man who allegedly gunned down his wife and three children before taking his own life is now suspected of having killed a stranger whose body was found just blocks away from the slain family's home.

According to the Marion County District Attorney's Office, investigators determined that Nikolay 'Nick' Lazukin beat 21-year-old Devin Matlock to death as he was walking home from a friend's apartment at around 2am on May 22.

After Lazukin returned to his Salem home, police say he killed his 26-year-old wife, Natalya, and their daughters, three-year-old Angelica, one-year-old Zoe and Sulamia, who was four months old.

Mystery: Lazukin, left, was not intoxicated the night of the murders, and police were not able to determine the motive behind the crimes

Lazukin then allegedly set their house on fire before turning the gun on himself.

Bystander: Police said 21-year-old Devin Matlock was walking home from friends' apartment when he ran into Lazukin, who beat him to death with a baseball bat

An autopsy determiner that the father of three young children died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Natalya Lazukin was shot twice in the 
head. The oldest daughter was struck once in the head and Zoe was shot twice in the head.

Baby Sulamia died of traumatic asphyxiation 
in her crib in the master bedroom.

The medical examiner also found that 
Lazukin was not intoxicated during the four-hour killing spree. No 
motive was identified behind the murders.

Marion County sheriff's investigators said that Matlock had never crossed paths with the Salem family prior to his murder, Oregon Live reported. 

Matlock's loved ones were told that he was simply at the wrong place, at the wrong time, according to his sister, Shalee Hernandez.

‘We have to relive the heartache and the pain,’ she told Oregon Live. ‘It's just too much.’

Matlock's friends told investigators 
that he had dinner with them and watched a video at the apartment in the
2400 block of Coral Avenue Northeast before walking home before 2am.

They said his usual route included 
Fisher Road, where surveillance video spotted Lazukin’s Jeep twice the 
night of the murders. That is where a deliveryman discovered the 
21-year-old’s body.

Matlock's blood was found on a 
baseball bat in Lazukin's Jeep and on his shoes. An autopsy found 
imprints from the shoe soles on Matlock's jaw, suggesting that the 
27-year-old stomped on his victim's face. 

Dr 
Larry Newman, with Oregon Medical Examiner’s Office, said Matlock died 
of blunt force head injuries and suffered a broken nose, jaw and 
cranium.

A short time later, investigators 
said Lazukin drove to a Super 8 Motel in Salem, where he called out to a
27-year-old woman. She asked him for a ride, and video showed the two 
leaving the motel's parking lot together in the Jeep at around 2.50am.

The woman, identified by police as Christine Lowe, later told investigators that Lazukin said 
that he lived with his ex-wife and three children and that he was 
looking to score some cocaine. He also asked her to go to Hawaii or Mexico with 
him.

After driving around, the woman said 
that Lazukin drove her to his home and parked. He told her he was going 
to get some money, and she thought she saw him take ammunition out of 
the glove compartment, she told investigators.

He then went inside and left her in the Jeep, she said. That is when Lazukin killed his wife and daughters, investigators said.

Bullet-riddled loaves of bread were 
found throughout the house after Lazukin apparently used them to muffle 
the shots from a .380 handgun that a family member had given him, 
according to police.

After murdering his family, Lazukin 
poured gasoline from large canisters in the attic stairway, the entry to
the older girls' bedroom and the master bedroom, and set them all 
ablaze.

He then returned to the Jeep, where 
he asked Lowe whether she had heard him arguing with his ex-wife, 
investigators said. She told him she did not hear a thing and they took 
off.

Happier times: The Lazukins' family told police they had no history of domestic abuse, and neighbors described the 27-year-old man as a good father

At one point, investigators said, 
Lazukin asked the woman whether she would remember him if police 
contacted her, and she said that she would.

Lowe said Lazukin gave her $25 to buy a
cell phone and drove her to a local Wal-Mart, but did not wait for her 
to come out of the store. 

Lazukin circled around the area and 
apparently saw the delivery truck driver discover Matlock's body along 
Fisher Road Northeast shortly before 4.30am, police said.

About an hour later, a neighbor saw 
smoke rising from the Lazukin home and called firefighters, who found 
the bodies of the mother and her children.

Lazukin drove onto Interstate 5 and 
headed south, investigators said. He stopped in a motel parking lot near
Exit 174 in Cottage Grove, where he sent a disturbing text message to 
his father-in-law shortly after 6am which read:

‘Please forgive me. They took control of my body and did it. I BEGGED THEM NOT TO BUT THEY DID. I'm so sorry.'

Lazukin died alone in the Jeep's back seat parked of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, investigators said.

'They were all wonderful,' said Irina Thompson, a relative of Nikolai Lazukin by marriage.

'Nik was so good with the kids. I can't understand why this would happen, but sometimes people change.'

Authorities said the wife and two of the children had been shot, and an infant asphyxiated.
