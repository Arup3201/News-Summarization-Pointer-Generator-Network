When former President George W. Bush was a no-show at the s 9/11 Memorial Museum dedication in New York City, some feared the snub was a political statement or a poke at President Barack Obama. But it turns out the Texan had a prior engagement with more than a dozen of America's bravest military heroes.

He was in Bentonville, Arkansas on Thursday, receiving the Patriot Award, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society's highest recognition.

At each year's awards ceremony, the society brings together living recipients of the Medal of Honor, a separate award given to members of the armed forces 'for acts of gallantry and intrepidity ... above and beyond the call of duty.'

Bush posted a photo Thursday night on his Instagram account, showing him posing with 14 living recipients of the honor, including one in a wheelchair.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee emceed the event.

President Barack Obama honored the nearly 3,000 victims of the September 11 attacks as he dedicated the memorial museum in Lower Manhattan on Thursday

The annual event took place at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.

Bush's father, the forty-first U.S. president, is also a past recipient of the award.

Some 9/11 survivors, and family members of victims, were angry when the younger Bush sent his regrets instead of joining other politicians for the opening of the 9/11 museum in Lower Manhattan.

Spokesman Freddy Ford told reporters on Wednesday only that a 'scheduling conflict' made the trip impossible.

A woman named Marie from Queens, New York called the Rush Limbaugh
 show on Thursday, saying she lost her firefighter son on 9/11 and 
didn't understand why Bush wouldn't be included in the ceremony.

'He should have been the first person to 
speak, or at least his name mentioned,' Marie said. 'I'm very upset. I 
lost a son there.'

Wal-Mart hosted the day's events in 
its home town, including a separate morning appearance by the Medal of
 Honor winners at its headquarters.

The daytime event was similar to appearances the society arranges nationwide in schools, bringing Medal of Honor recipients face-to-face with young people to tell their stories of selflessness and sacrifice.

Bush did not attend the Wal-Mart headwuarters gathering, instead walking around downtown Bentonville, shaking hands with well-wishers and stopping at one point for ice cream.

His spokespersons have consistently said he wants to remain out of the spotlight 
in his post-presidency, choosing instead to attend a sparse list of private events..

A former senior official in the Bush White House told MailOnline late on Thursday that he has always intended to steer clear of TV cameras and remain practically 'reclusive' as his successors run the federal government.

'His family is in Texas, his friends are in Texas, and his Presidential Library is in Texas,' the former official said. 'And he really doesn't want to invite attention. He's going to wait and let history judge his performance, especially in the months after 9/11.'

Instead, his office issued a statement saying he and Laura 'thank all those who played a role in creating this inspiring tribute, and we send our best wishes to those gathered to dedicate it.'

President Barack Obama dedicated the museum in a moving speech after touring the new facility with Bill and Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Bush's post-presidency has been a quiet one, marked by few public appearances and even fewer interviews.

He also declined Obama's invitation in 2011 to attend an event marking the death of al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden.

Former first lady Laura Bush said then that her husband thought the commemoration was 'for President Obama to do at this point.'

'He's made the real decision not to enter into politics or the public eye,' Mrs. Bush told The Associated Press then.

President Obama awarded the Medal of Honor on Tuesday to Army Sergeant Kyle White, for combat bravery in Afghanistan. White joins 77 other living recipients of the award.

Two 'trident'-shaped structural support beams from the original World Trade Center are on display inside the National September 11 Memorial Museum, along with educational exhibits and other recovered wreckage from the site of the deadly Islamist terror attack

Other plans: Bush's spokesman said the former president was invited but couldn't make it due to a scheduling conflict

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, current New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Governor George Pataki joined the Obamas and Bill and Hillary Clinton in New York on Thursday.

The new 9/11 Memorial Museum will open to the public on May 21; on display is the megaphone President Bush used to address rescue crews at Ground Zero on September 14, 2001.

Many have praised President Bush's response immediately following the attacks.

When the Twin Towers were hit, he was reading to a group of school children in Florida; then-White House Chief of Staff Andy Card paused him to deliver the news that America was under attack.

Bush addressed the nation that evening from the Oval Office and was on the scene at ground zero three days later, where he was pictured speaking over with the megaphone to first responders in a now-famous image.

His long-term reaction, however, launching America into the war on terror and sending troops into drawn-out wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dimmed his popularity.

The sparse remains of a flag that was raised over the wreckage of Ground Zero during the week following the 9/11 attacks can be seen in the museum

Emotional: Family and friends of the victims, along with survivors, took part in the tearful ceremony that recalled the heroism and tragedy of the day

Bush's full statement read: 'Americans who lived through September 11, 2001, will never forget the horror or the heroism we witnessed that morning. The 9/11 Memorial Museum in New York City will preserve the memory of that day for future generations.'

'It will honor the sacrifice of those who lost their lives and the bravery of those who saved others. And it will help ensure that our nation remembers the lessons of September 11th: that what happens abroad can affect us here at home, that evil is real, and that courage and love triumph over terror and hate.'

'Laura and I thank all those who played a role in creating this inspiring tribute, and we send our best wishes to those gathered to dedicate it.'

After Bush declined to appear at Ground Zero for the 2011 bin Laden-related event, Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library director Mark Updegrove said the decision surprised few.

'I think it was for the right reasons,' Updegrove told reporters. 'I think both Bush father and son are very conscious of not detracting the limelight that should be cast on our incumbent president.'

The opening of the museum comes after years of fighting between groups over how 9/11 should be portrayed for history, and whether the terror attackers' Muslim faith should play a prominent part in exhibits

Former President Bill Clinton was visibly moved by the ceremony; his administration preceded the 9/11 attacks, but the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 came on his watch

Cards, patches and other mementos of those killed at Ground Zero -- many left at the site's makeshift memorials in the months following the terrorist massacre -- are now on display at the National September 11 Memorial Museum

Never forget: A tribute to the firefighters killed on 9/11 is posted on the 'Final Column' displayed at the museum

Fragments of the fuselage of American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 aircraft that hit the World Trader Center's North tower, are displayed at the National September 11 Memorial Museum; the impact killed all 92 people on board, along with an unknown number on the building's upper floors
