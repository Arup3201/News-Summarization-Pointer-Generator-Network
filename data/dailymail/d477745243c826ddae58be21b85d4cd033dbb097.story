Kujtim Nicaj has been jailed after he was caught on CCTV having sex with a dog in Rye, New York State

A janitor has been jailed after he was caught on a resident's CCTV system letting himself in to their apartment and having sex with their pet dog.

Kujtim Nicaj, 44, admitted burglary as a sexually motivated felony and felony misconduct, and was sentenced to six years in prison and seven years of probation at Westchester County Court.

Once his prison term is completed he must sign the sex offender's register.

The court heard in February last year Nicaj, from Rye, New York State, was employed as superintendent of the Rye Colony Cooperative Apartments.

During this time he entered a resident's 
apartment without permission and while inside, engaged in several sex 
acts with the owner's 15-month-old Labrador retriever dog, USA Today reports.

The conduct was recorded on three cameras the homeowner, Alan Kachalsky, had set up after he became suspicious about goings-on in his apartment while he was out.

Mr Kachalsky said that he would return home and blinds would be drawn that had not been, a window would be left open that he had left shut.

The footage confirmed Mr Kachalsky's suspicions that something was amiss in his apartment and provided indisputable evidence for the police.

'A naked man, in your apartment, having sex with your dog,' Mr Kachalsky, an attorney, said.

A subsequent examination of the dog, Gunner, a one-year-old labrador, by a vet revealed no 
permanent physical damage.

Now, Kachalsky said, Gunner is mostly back to his old self. He turns two at the end of the month.

'Anytime anyone comes in, he's all over 'em. He's a terrific dog,' he said.

Nicaj was employed as a boss of the Rye Colony Cooperative Apartments and let himself into a tenant's apartment to have sex with his pet dog
