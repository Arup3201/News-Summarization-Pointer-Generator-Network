He won six league titles, three European Cups and scored more goals for Real Madrid in the Champions League than any player has scored for any club and this week Spain has been marking the passing of 20 years since he made his debut.

Raul Gonzalez Blanco was picked to start against Zaragoza on October 29 1994, in La Romareda and never looked back scoring 323 goals in the famous white shirt in 741 games. He also played 102 times for Spain scoring 44 goals.

The records will eventually tumble. His Spain milestone has already been passed by David Villa and Cristiano Ronaldo will surely go beyond his goals tally. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas could easily topple his appearances record and the Champions League landmark of 71 goals is currently being scrapped over by Ronaldo and Lionel Messi but however many records are rubbed out, his legacy will endure.

Born: June 27 1977 (age 37)

1994-2010: Real Madrid (741 apps, 323 gls)

2010-2012: Schalke 04 (66, 28)

2012-2014: Al Sadd (39, 11) 

1996-2006: Spain (102, 44) 

A product of Atletico Madrid’s youth system and a victim of their decision to close their academy, he fell into Real’s lap and from the moment Jorge Valdano gave him his bow he showed that while his talents alone were not going to be enough to make him one of the greats his determination would.

Sir Alex Ferguson described him as the best player in the world after one masterclass against Manchester United and he took levels of professionalism to new lengths when towards the end of his career at Real Madrid the club provided him with a special room in his house that recreated conditions of altitude to help athletes recover more quickly from matches.

‘It’s like sleeping in the mountains in Madrid. Not everybody who sleeps in the mountains is a great sportsman but it all helps. The key is to be the best prepared possible and that is my commitment to the club,’ he told Sportsmail in an exclusive interview in 2009, coincidentally the last time Real played Liverpool in the Champions League.

Raul finally checked out of Madrid the season Jose Mourinho turned up but that was not the end of his career.

Many would have opted straight for the lucrative swansong in a money-spinning club in the Far East but Raul went to ply his trade for two seasons in the Bundesliga with Schalke and he loved every minute of it.

‘I know a lot of marathon runners who are at their best when they are close to 40. You say to yourself, “It’s 42 kilometres and they are 37 or 38 years old”, but the body can! What you have to make sure you don’t lose is your head. That is the most important thing,’ he said of his time at Schalke that included a Champions League semi-final back at Old Trafford.

Above all Raul the player was a survivor. He made it through 17 years at Real – often the only homegrown player in a sea of Galatico signings. He then survived the rigours of German football at a time when other players would have had their feet up.

‘I am getting so much out of my time here - it’s just a shame that you would need three or four lives to experience everything you want to in football - in England or in North America. It makes the life of a player richer when you throw yourself into these things,’ he toldSportsmail in another  exclusive interview when at Schalke.

Now as he prepares for a new chapter at New York Cosmos the story goes on and rightly so this week Spain remembers him 20 years after he kicked his first ball in anger at the Bernabeu.
