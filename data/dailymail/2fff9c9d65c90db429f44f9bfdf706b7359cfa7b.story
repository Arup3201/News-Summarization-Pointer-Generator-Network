A Deutsche Bank vice president filed a gender bias lawsuit accusing the German bank of denying her pay and promotions, and trying to demote her because she took maternity leave.

Kelley Voelker, who works in New York in a hedge fund group, said she has never been promoted in her 13 years at Deutsche Bank despite being qualified to become a director.

Ms Voelker, who is in her mid-40s, sued the bank in papers filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Mother: Kelley Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010

A Deutsche Bank spokesman said: 'We take these allegations very seriously and are currently reviewing the complaint.'

In her complaint, Ms Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010.

Upon her return, she said, Deutsche Bank directed bigger accounts to a male colleague, slashed her bonus, and tried to demote her to a 'vague' marketing job. The bank retracted the demotion after her lawyers complained, she said.

The lawsuit states: 'Plaintiff was retaliated against and ultimately 'mommy-tracked' for her decision to take maternity leave.'

However, 'It is not surprising that such discriminatory treatment is permitted when the company tolerates managers to use (derogatory terms), as well as allowing supervisors to entertain clients at strip clubs and make open remarks about pregnancy,' the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit states that the company 'fosters an atmosphere where it seems appropriate to derail the careers of hardworking mothers like Ms Voelker while promoting the chauvinist ideals' it is said to hold.

According to the filings, Ms Voelker is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, among other remedies. Ms Voelker said she also filed a discrimination case with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Like many other lawsuits alleging gender bias on Wall Street, the complaint also provides illustrations of alleged 'hostile and degrading' conduct by bank employees to women.

In one instance, at a 2009 meeting where Ms Voelker questioned a decision by a supervisor, her boss said: 'I'd watch your step - she's pregnant,' the complaint said.

The law firm Thompson Wigdor represents Ms Voelker. That firm also represents Nafissatou Diallo, a hotel maid who accused former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a civil lawsuit of attempting to rape her. Criminal sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn were dropped last month.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc last November won the dismissal of a lawsuit, also filed by Thompson Wigdor, by a former vice president who said the bank unlawfully fired her while she was on maternity leave.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan dismissed an EEOC lawsuit accusing financial news company Bloomberg LP of a pattern of discrimination against pregnant women and mothers returning from maternity leave, even if there were cases of individual bias. Bloomberg said that lawsuit lacked merit.
