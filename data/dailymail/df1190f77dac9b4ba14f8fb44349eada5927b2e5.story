A Florida police officer under investigation for sexual battery and kidnapping committed suicide on Thursday as deputies were on their way to arrest him.

North Port officer Ricky Urbina, 44, was accused of handcuffing a woman at a party on March 2, taking her into a bedroom and sexually battering her while on duty and in uniform.

A second officer, Melanie Turner, who was at the party but off-duty, was arrested Thursday on the same allegations, according to ABC Action News.

While the incident is still under administrative investigation, officials said both Urbina and Turner had been cooperative, and an agreement was made that authorities would contact them if and when they take them into custody.

When investigators contacted Urbina on Thursday, he asked investigators to meet him somewhere besides his home.

While en route, deputies received a report of a shooting at Urbina’s home.

He is believed to have shot himself, according to FOX4.

According to a Sheriff’s Office report, the woman who made allegations against Urbina and Turner said the battery occurred at her home while hosting a birthday party for her boyfriend that Turner, who was off duty, was attending.

Urbina, whom the victim did not know, arrived at the party after Turner invited him.

The report says Urbina noticed Turner helping a guest remove a pair of handcuffs.

After the guest was freed, the victim was placed in handcuffs.

Witnesses at the party identified Urbina as the person who handcuffed her.

Urbina and Turner took the victim to the master bedroom, the report says.

The victim told investigators she remembered one of them mentioning a 'body search' and Turner locked the bedroom door behind them.

'Up to this point, the victim stated that she felt that the actions of Turner and Urbina were merely party fun and felt that she would be released,' the report says.

'However, she was not released.'

Turner removed the victim’s pants without her consent and Urbina sexually battered the woman while Turner kissed her, according to the report.

The victim saw the window blinds open and said her boyfriend is 'going to kill you both' if he were to see what was occurring.

Turner put the woman’s pants back on and Urbina removed the handcuffs.

Ricky Urbina was said to be scared the arrest would ruin his career and marriage

Turner and Urbina left the room together, leaving the victim behind.

She eventually left the room herself in tears and told a friend at the party she had been 'violated'.

Another off-duty officer at the party contacted a police supervisor.

Turner was interviewed four hours after the incident, but deputies redacted a summary of her statement from the report because she was intoxicated.

Urbina refused an interview until his attorney could be present, the report says.

During that time, he made statements to an investigator that he 'would be fired over this incident, he would not fight the allegations and that the allegations would cost him his marriage'.
