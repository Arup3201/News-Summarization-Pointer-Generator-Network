A 12-year-old girl became pregnant and had an abortion after a sex session in a church porch which was interrupted by a curate.

The shocked churchman heard the girl having sex with her 17-year-old boyfriend and opened the door to see him getting up and her lying on the ground.

She denied having sex with the boy but was forced to admit the truth after she became pregnant and tests on the foetus showed he was the father.

The curate heard a male and a female talking about sex and  'noises consistent with sexual activity' as he approached the church porch in Paignton, Devon, file photograph,  in March, 2014

Simon Saunders, now 18, of Torquay, Devon, admitted sexual activity with a child and was ordered to receive one to one counselling as part of an 18 month community order.

Judge Graham Cottle, sitting at Exeter Crown Court told him he needed to learn how to deal with sexual situations in an appropriate way.

Richard Crabb, prosecuting, said the curate of the church in Paignton, disturbed the couple when he heard noise coming from the porch as he was preparing for a morning service in March.

He said: 'The curate went to investigate and heard a male and female talking about having sex and noises which were consistent with sexual activity.

'He walked towards them and disturbed them and saw the girl on the ground with her legs apart and the defendant getting up from above her.

'He recognised both of them because he had seen them both hanging around the churchyard after school. He knew their names and the police were informed.

'The girl was video interviewed and denied any sexual activity had taken place but her mother later contacted the police to say she was pregnant and she was interviewed again and confirmed there had been sexual activity.

'She had a termination and tests showed a very strong scientific support for the proposition that the defendant was the father.'

Mr Joss Ticehurst, defending, said Saunders had been in a relationship with the girl but was unaware of her true age.

He said he has learned his lesson and will now check that any future partner was above the age of consent before engaging in a sexual relationship.
