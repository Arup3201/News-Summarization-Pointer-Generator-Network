A 67-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of historical child abuse following an investigation into claims of a paedophile ring with links to Downing Street.

The unnamed suspect was held in Dorset yesterday and questioned at a local police station before being released last night, Scotland Yard said.

The arrest was part of an inquiry named Operation Brancaster, which was set up after MP Tom Watson claimed there was a child abuse group which had with links to Number 10.

In 2012, he used Prime Minister's Questions to claim that a file of evidence used to convict a man called Peter Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained 'clear intelligence' of a paedophile gang.

He also claimed that a member of the group had bragged about links with a senior aide to a former Prime Minister.

Mr Watson wrote to Scotland Yard about the case, and the force later launched a number of separate criminal investigations after assessing the information.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'A 67-year-old man has been arrested this morning, Tuesday, 14 October, at an address in Dorset on suspicion of historical child abuse offences.

'He was taken into custody locally and has now been released on police bail to a date in late November pending further inquiries.

'This arrest falls under a strand called Operation Brancaster, which was originally assessed as part of Operation Fairbank, and subsequently reached the criminal threshold.'

Scotland Yard say the man has now been bailed until late November while the investigation continues
