After a brilliant year with Real Madrid and a tough World Cup campaign with Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo is making the most of his time away from football.

The superstar is currently enjoying La Liga's two-week winter break after helping Los Blancos win the Club World Cup in Morocco.

And, after travelling home to Madeira to see a new statue of himself unveiled on Monday, the 29-year-old is now putting his feet up ahead of a return to action against Valencia on January 4.

Alongside the photo, the former Manchester United man wrote: 'Nice to relax and have some fun on some days off.'

Unlike Premier League players, Ronaldo and La Liga's other stars will be free to enjoy Christmas Day, with no fixtures scheduled until January 3.

After taking on Valencia, Ronaldo and his team-mates face a Madrid derby against city rivals Atletico in the Copa del Rey last 16 on January 7.

Three days later it's a home league game against Espanyol, before Ronaldo travels to Switzerland on January 12 in the hope of being crowned Ballon d'Or winner for the second consecutive year. 

Real's return leg against Atletico at the Bernabeu comes three days after the awards ceremony in Zurich.
