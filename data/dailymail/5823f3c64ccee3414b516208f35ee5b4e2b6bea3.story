Murdered student Jamie Gao was living his Australian dream: A first-class education at Sydney's University of Technology, a happy family life in a $1.5-million Hurstville home, an active social life, and even a budding romance with a girl whom he'd 'liked for a while'.

But that dream turned into a nightmare on Tuesday, May 20. That afternoon began, police allege, with Mr Gao wading 'in over his head' into a high-stakes drug deal, and ended with the university student being shot twice in the chest, his body wrapped in a blue tarpaulin before being dumped into the ocean off Cronulla.

The body found floating off Shelly Beach has now been formally identified as the 20-year-old student.

The day before, though, was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend.

At no stage, the friend says, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'.

Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing.

Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her.

On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD.

The 19-year-old female friend, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day.

'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.'

Police allege Mr Gao was murdered on Tuesday, May 20 at Padstow in Sydney's southwest between 1.40pm and 2.30pm after allegedly meeting two young Asian men and former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson.

Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'.

'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said.

She told MailOnline that his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure.

'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said.

'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.'

Mr Gao lived with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville. A woman at the home on Monday declined to comment.

Police say CCTV footage shows Mr Gao arriving in his own vehicle at Arab Road, Padstow, last Tuesday and meeting with two young Asian men before he allegedly met up with former detectives McNamara and Rogerson.

Footage shows one man, believed to be Mr Gao, getting out of a car and carrying a large bag to a station wagon.

He is seen getting into the station wagon before it drives away.

The car was driven to a storage unit nearby, where police will allege Mr Gao was killed for the bag's contents just before 2.30pm.'

Mr Gao's friend said she was shocked the student, who graduated from Caringbah High School in 2011, was allegedly involved in drug dealing.

'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said.

'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.'

The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart.

'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said.
