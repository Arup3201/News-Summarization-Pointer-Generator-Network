Steven Gerrard refused to discuss his contract following Liverpool's 3-1 win over Leicester City.

The Liverpool captain has been offered a new deal by manager Brendan Rodgers following reports of a rift between the two, but the former England midfielder remained coy on the subject.

'I'll decide when I'm ready,' the 34-year-old told BT Sport. 'There's nothing to say on the contract. When there is, the fans have known me long enough, I'll come out and I'll say what I need to say.'

Gerrard has to decide whether he will stay or leave Liverpool with a new contract offered by Brendan Rodgers

Questioned what will sway him to stay or leave Liverpool, Gerrard continued: 'No, you can't ask.

'I think the last three performances have been superb. We need to keep trying to improve on that. 

'The reason I don't want to answer your question tonight is because it's not about me it's about a great team performance and a great three points. That's what the headline should be.'

Gerrard was handed a place in the starting line-up against Leicester by Rodgers after being dropped to the substitutes' bench for their match against Stoke at Anfield on Saturday.

He came on in the 75th minute of the 1-0 win on the 16th anniversary of his Reds debut.

Rodgers afterwards confirmed Liverpool have offered Gerrard a new contract with his current £120,000-per-week deal ending next year, but the manager says it won't come down to money.

Sportsmail reporters deliver their verdict on whether Gerrard should stay or leave 

'He'll be offered a contract at the club and it'll be a good offer,' Rodgers said after their 3-1 win on Tuesday night. 'It won't be about money. 

'He's got so much love and passion for Liverpool that the money is irrelevant.

'Like anyone, salary is important. For Steven it's not the big decision for him. He's had 16 incredible years here. I couldn't see him playing for any other club in this country and maybe it's just something that's a life thing for him.'
