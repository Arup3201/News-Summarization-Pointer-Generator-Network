This is the chilling moment a lion was spotted roaming the streets in suburban Mumbai.

Passers-by stumbled upon the big cat after it was said to have escaped the Borivali Sanjay Gandhi National Park safari just north of India’s financial capital.

However, an official from the popular tourist attraction denied reports that a lion had fled the reserve, which attracts more than two million visitors a year.

The official said the park's three lions were all accounted for. 

The moment was caught on camera as the lion casually walked along a main road near Thane on Sunday.

A police officer, seated in a car as it followed the animal, used his mobile phone to record the surreal sight.

But the stray lion isn’t enjoying its moment in the spotlight and suddenly makes a turn and scampers off the road in an attempt to elude its followers.

The 35-second video shows the lion vanishing into a nearby forest.

The search for the big cat is ongoing.

Pawan Sharma, founder of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare, told DNA: 'After seeing the video, we tried to trace the lion with forest officials.

'However, till now, there has been no clues. The search will be on.'

Thane chief conservator of forest, Kaushlesh Singh, told the news agency: ‘The three lions are safe at SGNP.

‘I saw the video clip and have sent teams to trace the lion. At the same time we are cross-checking the relevance of the video and trying to figure the location of the lion to ascertain whether it strayed from any nearby locality.’
