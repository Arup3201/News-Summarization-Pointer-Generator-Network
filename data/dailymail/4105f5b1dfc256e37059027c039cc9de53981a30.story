Manchester United are giving a trial to Poland U16 international goalkeeper Tomasz Kucz.

The 15-year-old plays for Polonia Warsaw and has been watched by some of Europe's top clubs since the age of 13.

As Sportsmail reported, he gained further acclaim after performing well for Poland U15s against Wales in Rhyl last year where he was watched by several scouts including those of United.

Kucz was invited to spend time training with Liverpool and Rangers last year and has had two similar stints with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen. 

Fulham and Everton have also expressed an interest and held talks with his father Andrej.

The promising keeper, who already trains with Polonia's first team and is a regular in their U19s, is due to spend this week at United with the hope of impressing and earning a contract offer. Kucz turns 16 on July 6 this year.

Kucz has been a regular for Polonia U19s and has represented Poland at U15 and U16 level
