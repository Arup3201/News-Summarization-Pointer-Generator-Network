Bum-bags, jelly shoes and thick glasses. There have been some surprising style revivals over the past few years and yet one trend remains baffling and that's the penchant for socks and sandals.

For years they have been judged the lowest of the low when it comes to style mistakes and were recently voted the number one summer style faux pas in a poll by Swimwear365.

However, thanks to certain sandal-and-sock-sporting celebrities (we mean you, Rita Ora, and you Bruce Willis), the trend is slowly trickling into the mainstream

Bruce Willis was spotted on the streets of LA in a pair of sturdy sandals and grey socks this week

Bruce was spotted this week wearing a pair of sensible suede sandals paired with rather woolly grey socks as he spent quality time with his daughter Mabel.

And even celebrities without the dad status to defend their sock and sandal combo are happily jumping aboard the trend.

Rita Ora is a repeat offender, seen rocking the trend on more than one occassion. Mary-Kate and Ashley Oslen arrived at JFK airport, New York in March this year in matching sandal and sock combos.

Justin Bieber, David Beckham, Jake Gyllenhaal have all championed the style.

And where celebrities lead, the rest of us follow - at least if new sales figures from a major department store are to be believed.

High street retailer Debenhams, has seen a 68 per cent increase in sales of socks and sandals - though quite how they know they are being worn together is unclear - while purchases of bright short-sleeved shirts have soared by 72 per cent, completing the sad-dad ensemble.

This trend could simply be explained by the issue of comfort says personal stylist, Alain Mehada of Debenhams.

'We didn’t see it coming, but perhaps we should have done as let’s be honest there are fewer things more comfy than a solid well-made sandal and a soft pair of socks to stop them rubbing on bare skin.

'As for the shirts, who can resist a smile when someone walks past in a garishly bright short-sleeved top. It brightens up the day and reminds people of holidays and beach-side fun, even if they are stuck at home'.

Alain added that female celebrities have helped to transform the fashion faux-pas into a true style staple.

'Teaming socks and sandals together provides comfort and style but the girls have taken this trend to the next level.

'Pastel socks with metallic sandals and printed socks with neutral sandals reflect the autumn winter 14 catwalk style as seen in runway shows such as Dior, Burberry and Hermes'.
