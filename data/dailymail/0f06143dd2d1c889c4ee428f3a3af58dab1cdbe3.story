Neil Warnock chose his words carefully given he already has one FA charge relating to referees hanging over his head, but his anger at the officiating following this dramatic draw was clear.

Never one to shy away from emphatic statements, the Crystal Palace manager claimed Craig Dawson’s challenge on Julian Speroni in the midst of Victor Anichebe’s goal was tantamount to ‘assault’.

Bert Trautmann, who broke his neck in the 1956 FA Cup final, got a mention.

The goal, six minutes after the interval, sliced Palace’s 2-0 lead in half to set up a last-gasp equaliser from the penalty spot by Saido Berahino.

His composed finish, in the third minute of added time, only enhanced his reputation as well as his standing as England’s leading marksman in the top-flight. Seven in the Premier League now, Roy Hodgson will note.

Warnock had no complaints that referee Mark Clattenburg pointed to the spot when Mile Jedinak foolishly slid in on Anichebe as he shaped to shoot.

But he complained that Clattenburg had failed to act when Dawson tripped Wilfried Zaha in the area in the first half. Having accused referee Craig Pawson of being influenced by Chelsea players last weekend, none of his Palace players tried to apply any pressure.

‘It’s a certain penalty,’ Warnock said ‘You can’t win. We had four or five Chelsea lads surrounding the referee last week and we were told that was wrong. I don’t want my lads to start going silly.’

On the Speroni incident he said: ‘It’s just like an assault. Dawson goes for two or three yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face. I’ve not seen one of them since Bert Trautmann, it’s ridiculous.’

That description is exaggerated to say the least but it is true that another referee may have blown for a foul as the players collided following Chris Brunt’s corner.

Speroni was down for three minutes receiving treatment but wanted to continue. Warnock overruled and dragged his goalkeeper off.

‘He’s telling the physio, “I’ll be alright” and I didn’t want to risk it,’ Warnock said. ‘Once they’d scored I thought they’d try the same again. The only one to give him some protection was me.’

Alan Irvine believed the incident was no more severe than when bodies came together for Palace’s opening goal in the 16th minute. Brede Hangeland headed Yannick Bolasie’s corner into Dawson, then prodded the rebound in with his right boot.

‘I looked at the referee on both occasions and neither time he gave a free-kick,’ said Irvine. ‘There was an awful lot of players flying in at those inswinging corners. I thought the contact was after the ball had been headed by Victor.’

Fraizer Campbell            90          10.8      6.7

Palace built on their lead shortly before the interval when Sebastien Pocognoli slid in desperately on Bolasie. Jedinak strode forward and sent Foster the wrong way.

In the end a draw seemed fair, certainly once Anichebe arrived at half-time in place of Stephane Sessegnon to change the complexion of this match.

It was Anichebe's first goal of the season after recovering from a groin injury and Irvine felt he played a major part.

He said: 'There's no doubt Victor made a difference and before the game I thought we might need him. Having watched Palace and looked at their strengths and the way they are able to play I felt Victor would be needed at some point.'

Irvine admitted, though, he had to get angry with his side after their first-half no show.

He said: 'They did see another side to me, one which doesn't come out very often but has to come out from time to time.

'I was bitterly disappointed with the first 32 minutes of the game. We conceded the penalty on a counter attack but for the first 32 minutes we were awful. After that we did what we were supposed to be doing and we eventually got a reward for that.'

Palace, meanwhile, are on the brink of being taken over by American entrepreneur Josh Harris, the owner of the New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia 76ers.

Warnock had an opinion on that too. ‘If the billionaire is in the background I’m sure we’ll be looking for telephone numbers,’ he said. A busy January might beckon.
