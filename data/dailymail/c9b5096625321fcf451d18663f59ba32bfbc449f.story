Real Madrid star Gareth Bale is continuing to brush up on his Spanish skills.

The 25-year-old, who revealed in November that he was fluent in Spanish swear words, posted a picture on Instagram of himself having a lesson with his tutor on Wednesday night.

Bale also posted the message: 'I enjoyed the Spanish class with Michael this afternoon. More work !!'

The former Tottenham winger could well have been going over what the word for 'pass' translates to in Spanish (pasar) - after being booed by some sections of the Bernabeu crowd when he opted against giving the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo in the win against Espanyol - consequently missing the target.

It would be hard for the home faithful to be too critical of Bale following the 3-0 win on Saturday though, with his stunning free-kick doubling the Galacticos' lead before the half-time interval.

Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo himself has urged the Madrid fans to go easy on Bale, insisting he is a very important part of Carlo Ancelotti's side.

Next up for the Spanish giants is the second leg of their last-16 Copa del Rey clash with rivals Atletico Madrid on Thursday, with Ancelotti's side needing to overturn a two-goal deficit to progress.
