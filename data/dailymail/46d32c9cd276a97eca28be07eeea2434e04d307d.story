A seven-month-old girl was allegedly killed by her grandmother who sliced her throat with a circular saw when she wouldn't stop crying.

Officers found the child, identified by family members as Rose Herrera, after being called on Monday morning to a family home on the city's West Side.

Police said the 52-year-old relative used a power saw to cut the baby's throat to stop the infant from crying.

Cause of death was confirmed on Tuesday by the Cook County Medical Examiner as blunt force injuries to the head and probable suffocation from a sock placed in the child's mouth.

Police were called to this home in the 2800 block of South Avers Avenue in the Little Village section of Chicago, where they discovered the lifeless body of the infant with her throat cut

The death was declared a homicide, the medical examiner's office said on Tuesday.  

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the woman is in police custody at a hospital with self-inflicted wounds.

Police said both the baby and the woman were found by another relative.

Illinois Department of Children and Family Services officials said the agency had no prior contact with the family. 

Authorities said no other children were present in the home at the time of the incident.

Ben Llamas works with the child's father and drove him to the scene. Mr Llamas told the Chicago Tribune the father was upset but did not talk about what happened.

His friend had moved in to that house about a year ago with a woman, Llamas said. The couple had a young child.

‘At first, he was reluctant, but when the baby came, he fell in love,’ Llamas said. ‘He shows us pictures of that baby every day.’

Neighbors said several people live in the home where the baby was found.

‘They were really good people,’ Francisco Arreola told the Chicago Tribune in Spanish. ‘I would always see them and they were very happy. I never heard them fight or anything.’

Police were called at around 9.40am to a multi-family home in the 2800 block of South Avers Avenue in the Little Village section of Chicago, where they discovered the lifeless body of the infant with 'visible trauma'.

The child was pronounced dead at the scene. Sources have identified the little girl as Rosie Herrera and told ABC 7 Chicago the 52-year-old woman who allegedly cut her throat may have been her grandmother.

Investigators said before the suspect took a circular saw to the child's body, she tried to quiet her down by stuffing something down her throat.

Following the  killing, the 52-year-old reportedly attempted to take her own life. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in a stable condition.
