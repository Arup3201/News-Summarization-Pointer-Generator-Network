Hosts Guinea have ruled out switching the dates of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations finals to accommodate the Qatar World Cup, their sports minister said.

Domani Dore contradicted a statement by FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke, who said last week that the 2023 Nations Cup would be pushed back six months to June from its usual January date.

With the 2022 World Cup now scheduled for November/December, Valcke said that hosting the Nations Cup just one month later would be unfeasible.

The Qatar 2022 World Cup is likely to be moved to November and December, interrupting football's calendar

Jerome Valcke had said the Cup of Nations would be moved to June, but Guinea say that is impossible

He added that it had been agreed with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to move the 16-team tournament to later in the year.

Guinea, however, say they will refuse the new dates.

'We cannot accommodate the Nations Cup in June, it is the rainy season,' Dore told Guinea television.

'CAF needs to take care to seek the advice of Guinea that we as a state decide which dates the tournament will be played. We understand the problem around the World Cup and a clash with the Nations Cup.

'But CAF needs to take care to ask our opinion. In June, we cannot accommodate a Nations Cup tournament. It's not possible,' Dore added.

Ivory Coast won this year's Cup of Nations, which was held in Equatorial Guinea in January and February
