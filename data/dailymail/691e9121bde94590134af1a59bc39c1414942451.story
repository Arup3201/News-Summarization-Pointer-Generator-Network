A number of England’s Ashes cricket stars are facing ‘very substantial’ bills from the tax man after investing in film funds, it has been reported.

International players including some members of the Ashes-winning team of 2005 are said to have been among those who invested in partnerships set up by Ingenious Media.

HM Revenue & Customs is reported to have sent demands to Michael Vaughan, Paul Collingwood, Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles – all of whom took part in the landmark triumph over Australia.

According to the Guardian, the four players invested in Ingenious Film Partners in February and March 2005 - just months before England secured its first Ashes victory in 18 years.

HMRC is currently locked in a legal battle with Ingenious Media, which set up the partnerships, claiming the investments were a means of avoiding tax.

The company has previously denied the claims, saying HMRC approved its schemes at the time and that the investments were made in box office hits including Avatar and Hotel Rwanda.

The Guardian reports that former England captain Michael Vaughan invested in three of the partnerships being challenged by HMRC – Ingenious Film Partners 2, Ingenious Film Partners and Inside Track Productions.

The list of investors is publicly registered at Companies House.

The managing director of Arundel Wealth, Jon Alexander, was brought in by the Professional Cricketers’ Association to provide assistance for the players affected. The Guardian quotes him as saying that some are facing ‘very substantial demands’.

Apart from David Gower, the former cricketers contacted by the newspaper declined to discuss the matter publicly – although one spoke anonymously to say the demand could place him in ‘financial difficulty’.

David Gower is quoted as saying that the money involved ‘won’t wipe me out.’

But he added: ‘But the principle is just wrong and I want to stand up against it. The government wanted to encourage investment in the film industry, there was a genuine element of risk.

‘The films were successful and generated more than £1bn in taxable income and now HMRC is coming back ten years later saying the schemes weren’t valid.’

Ingenious has repeatedly defended the schemes it set up and has said  it is confident of winning the legal battle.

A spokesman is quoted in the Guardian as saying that its partnerships were either 'sale and leaseback partnerships’ established under government legislation or were ‘bona fide commercial partnerships operated for profit’.

The case comes as HMRC stepped up its crackdown on tax-avoidance schemes in a bid to claw back £7.1billion from 43,000 people.
