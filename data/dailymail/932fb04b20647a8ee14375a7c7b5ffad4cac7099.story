Rickie Lambert wants Steven Gerrard to sign the contract on offer from Liverpool and end his career at the club. 

The striker, a lifelong Liverpool fan, hopes Gerrard will not let his contract come to an end and leave in the summer.

Gerrard has become a rare one-club player but will be able to talk to clubs outside of England from the start of next year.

The Liverpool skipper proved his worth to the club once more at Leicester on Tuesday night, capping off a fine display with a goal in the Reds' 3-1 win.

Lambert said: ‘We are desperate to keep Stevie. It’s his and the club’s decision but I think he needs to stay at Liverpool for the rest of his life. Stevie is his own man but he is Mr Liverpool.

‘He has got more than enough in the tank. He is still one of the best players around.’
