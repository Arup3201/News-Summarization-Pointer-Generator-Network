They are famed for being at each other's throats in a bloody feud that rocked the Appalachians more than a hundred years ago.

But the Hatfield and McCoy families, whose saga of murder, marriage and betrayal claimed 12 lives from 1865 to 1890, have finally found a common interest - distilling liquor.

Descendants of the legendary William Anderson 'Devil Anse' Hatfield and Randolph McCoy have formed a business alliance to bottle and sell branded moonshine made from an old family recipe.

Hooch, not war: Hatfields, who once fought and killed their McCoy neighbors, now produce moonshine at $32.99 a bottle out of their West Virginia brewery. Pictured above are Nancy Hatfield, the oldest living family member, and her son-in-law Chad Bishop, who runs the distillery with the help of McCoy business know-how

Their distillery in Gilbert, West Virginia, sits on old Hatfield land, not far from the Kentucky border, across which they would trade legal challenges and deadly vigilante raids with McCoy rivals in an escalating feud.

But despite the decades of bad blood between them, the two families have united behind Devil Anse's recipe for home-brewed hooch.

Chad Bishop, who joined the Hatfield clan by marrying Devil Anse's great-great-great granddaughter, now runs the business.

Amber, his wife, and her mother Nancy - the oldest living Hatfield - also work at the distillery to produce their flagship 'Drink of the Devil' white corn whiskey, which sells at $32.99 for a 25oz bottle.

Promotional material says their moonshine will 'go down smooth but kick like a mule'.

Ronald McCoy, the great-great grandson of Randolph, worked as a consultant when the brewery started up, helping to refine the product and marketing strategy.

The bloody history of the family feud dates back to the civil war, when a Hatfield Confederate militia named the Logan Wildcats reportedly gunned down Asa Harmon McCoy, a Union soldier who had come home injured.

Years later bad blood worsened after the Hatfield family were accused of stealing a McCoy hog, but were acquitted in what the Kentucky family saw as a rigged court.

The feuding peaked when three McCoys killed Elliston Hatfield, Devil Anse's brother, in 1882. The men were arrested, but Devil Anse organised a vigilante group who captured and killed them before their trial.

Six years later, Randolph McCoy's house was burned to the ground by the Hatfields, and several fleeing McCoys were shot dead, injured and beaten.

In reprisal, a group of McCoy-led vigilantes rode over the border into West Virginia, killed several Hatfields and rounded up nine men to stand trial in Kentucky.

All the men were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, except for Ellison Mounts, Devil Anse's nephew, who was publicly hanged.

The controversial legal process caused the Supreme Court to intervene, as West Virginia argued its citizens were illegally extradited so couldn't face trial.

But the court decided their was nothing to stop the prosecution once the family was in Kentucky, and the court's punishments were exacted in full, putting a stop to the bloody exchanges.
