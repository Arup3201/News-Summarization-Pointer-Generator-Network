Arsenal clash with United didn’t serve up the quality we hoped for but it was still an intriguing game. Arsenal will feel their performance deserved better but how many times are they going to lose goals from attacking positions?

They have conceded 24 goals in all competitions so far this season and eight of them — exactly a third — have been let in on the counter-attack.

They are naive at the back and you don’t need to have played football to realise their defence is weak and they are crying out for a defensive midfielder.

1 - Jack Wilshere has got through just one 90 minutes in the league in the last nine months.

Jack Wilshere has staked a claim but he has completed 90 minutes in the Premier League only once in the last nine months. That is an incredible statistic.

He has had a lot of injuries but for that role you need to be consistent and robust. In the same period Nemanja Matic has started 23 league games for Chelsea and been subbed just once.

Like centre backs, defensive midfielders are hard to find but Calum Chambers could be their best option. Whether Arsene Wenger would be prepared to leave out his captain Mikel Arteta, though, is another matter.

ROONEY'S RENAISSANCE

People say Wayne Rooney plays better when he’s angry, but I’ve never subscribed to that theory.

The responsibility of being captain of England and Manchester United seems to be making him more disciplined and controlled.

He looks comfortable in himself and he was excellent at the Emirates.

At the start of the season there was a question as to whether he or Robin van Persie should be captain. At the moment, there’s no comparison.

It’s been a good week for Wayne, winning his 100th cap and scoring goals, and as our table below shows, this is his second best start to a season.

MAGPIES FLYING 

What a difference a bit of time can make.

Six weeks ago Alan Pardew looked a dead man walking. 

Now Newcastle have won five in a row for the first time since 2012 and are only outside the top four on goal difference. 

All credit to Pardew and his players for an incredible turnaround.

AT LAST THE REAL YAYA TURNS UP 

On Saturday Yaya Toure finally served up the kind of display he was putting in week in, week out last season. Toure  has been heavily criticised but I hope he now takes the season by the scruff of the neck.

He took his goal well, as our graphic below shows. It was the kind of surging Toure run that we’ve become so used to.

If Man City want to retain their title they must keep that fighting spirit. An eight-point gap to the imperious Chelsea is not insurmountable but they can’t afford any more slip ups.

SO IT'S NOT ALL MARIO'S FAULT... 

Mario Balotelli's form this season has taken a lot of heat off this Liverpool team. Injury meant he was nowhere to be seen at Crystal Palace but still the side looked so poor throughout.

It’s time Brendan Rodgers gave his players some home truths, but I’m not sure he’s the type of manager to do that — he likes to protect his players. But since losing to Chelsea at Anfield last season, they have lost seven of their last 15 league games. That’s not good enough.

Yannick Bolasie put in one of the best performances of the season, but any winger would have fancied their chances against Javi Manquillo.

DELIGHT FOR DANNY 

It was only a matter of time before Danny Ings started to bang in the goals in the Premier League. For some there is an inferiority complex when they step up, but Ings now looks right at home.

He scored 26 last season and will get even more when Sam Vokes returns from injury — they scored 47 between them in 2013-14.

In Sean Dyche they have one of the most positive people I have ever met to lead them, and back-to-back wins shows they are not just here to make up the numbers.

LEON'S HAPPY 400TH 

There can’t be many better ways to cap your 400th club appearance than by scoring a winner at home.

Leon Osman has been a great servant and a classy player for Everton. They are now two points off the top four and with teams around them stuttering, there’s no reason why they can’t target a Champions League place.
