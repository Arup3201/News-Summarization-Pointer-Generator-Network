A teenage girl with 'tremendous promise' as a footballer has died after suddenly collapsing at her home just days after scoring her first goal at a top women's team.  

Lydia Bennett died 'within an hour' of taking ill at her family home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, on November 4. 

Today her family paid tribute to the 'beautiful' teenager who had been planning a future in sports.

Tragic: Lydia Bennett died this week after collapsing at her home in Tamworth, Staffordshire. The 17-year-old was described as a 'bubbly' teenager by her football team mates 

'We have three beautiful children, of which Lydia is one,' Paul and Carole Bennett said in a statement with their daughters, Rachel and Charlotte. 

'We are all missing her so deeply, it is hurting so much.' 

Lydia, who had been playing for Burton Ladies FC at the time of her death, fell ill at home on Tuesday and rapidly deteriorated, her father said. 

'It was roughly about an hour afterwards, it was so sudden. We don't know what the cause is.' 

The teenager, described as 'adored by everyone' at her football club, had been planning a career in sports. 

'She wanted a career in sports either as a teacher or player. That's what she was studying towards,' Mr Bennett added. 

'As her family we would like to thank her friends, colleagues and team mates for their support and such kind words.

'Adored by everyone': Friends and family today paid tribute to the teenager who was loved by 'all' at her football club 

Burton Albion cancelled this weekend's games in memory of the teenager. The cause of Lydia's death is not yet known 

'She was beautiful, lovely, wonderful, just the best daughter anyone could wish to have. I don't know what we can do without her.' 

Just days before her tragic death the 17-year-old scored her first goal for Burton Ladies FC. 

Adam Smallman, head of football at the club, said the teenager's death had come as a shock to all who knew her.

'It looks like its just one of those tragic things that came out of the blue with no warning.

'She was fighting fit and trained four times a week, she was proving a real talent who I'm sure would have gone on to have a successful career.

'Lydia was showing tremendous promise and was over the moon to score her first goal for the team at the weekend.'

A statement previously published on the club's website described her as a 'popular and proud' team member.

'Lydia was a very popular and proud member of Burton Albion and her family, team mates and coaching staff will be supported through this difficult period.

'The thoughts of the whole Brewers family are with Lydia’s family and friends at this sad time.

'As a mark of respect this Sunday’s games have been cancelled for our women’s first and development teams,' it said. 

Nicola Mellor, female football lead at Burton Albion Community Trust added 'Lydia was a very bubbly person who was adored by every member of the girls football and education programme.

'Lydia always put 100 per cent effort into everything she did with the club.'

It is understood the teenager died in Good Hope hospital  after collapsing at the home she shared with her sisters and parents. 

Her older sister Rachel paid tribute to the schoolgirl on Facebook, writing: 'I love u baby sister. Im so proud of all u have achieved in the past 17 years. I adore u n wish that u didnt have to leave me. I love n miss u every second (sic).' 

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police confirmed the death was not being treated as suspicious.
