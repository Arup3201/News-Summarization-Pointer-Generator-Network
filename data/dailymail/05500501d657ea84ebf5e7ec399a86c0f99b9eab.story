Former Chelsea and Tottenham goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini is suing a single mother for £300,000 after his motorbike accident in November 2009.

The Italian broke his wrist and pelvis when his BMW superbike collided with Jennifer Bernard's Ford Fiesta in Walthamstow, East London.

The 39-year-old recovered and has since signed for David Beckham's former club LA Galaxy, but has filed a lawsuit against Miss Bernard alleging his injuries were caused by her 'negligence'.

Claims: Goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini says the motorbike crash cost him a No 1 spot at Tottenham

Cudicini is best known for his spell at Chelsea, alongside the likes of Frank Lampard and Mario Melchiot

He says the crash left him £8.8million out of pocket and is suing Miss Bernard, who earns £800-a-month working at ASDA, and her insurers for £300,000 in damages.

Police cleared the 28-year-old mother-of-three of any criminal wrongdoing after an investigation.

His claim is made up of expenses, loss of earnings and future loss of wages.

According to The Sun, it includes an £8,235 chauffeur bill 
for the time he was out injured and his family’s £1,865 travel costs 
when they looked after him in Italy.

He says his mother was his carer for a
month at a cost of £800.

And his medical bills include a chiropractor 
at a Harley Street clinic costing £1,550.

Cudicini, who first came to the Premier 
League to play for Chelsea, also claims the crash ended his hopes of 
becoming Tottenham's first choice goalkeeper.

At the time he was competing for the 
first team place with Heurelho Gomes. Although he returned to action a 
year later, the Spurs went on to sign Brad Friedel as cover and Cudicini
slipped down the pecking order.

Damage: Miss Bernard, 28, was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing following the accident

Cudicini, who was believed to be earning around £40,000-a-week at Spurs, claims this may not have happened if he had been fit and adversely affected his negotiations for a new contract.

Miss Bernard, an Arsenal supporter from Enfield, North London, told The Sun she was shocked to receive court papers from Cudicini's lawyers.

She said: 'I could see he was making a claim but I couldn't understand why.'

Her £500 Ford Fiesta was written off in the crash which left her five-year-old daughter Sophia showered in glass.

MailOnline has been unable to reach Carlo Cudicini for comment.
