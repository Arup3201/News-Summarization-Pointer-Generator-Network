Ryan Giggs wants to show Manchester United he should be their next permanent manager.

The United legend will begin his short stint as the club’s interim boss on Saturday and has already promised to ditch any players who don’t live up to Old Trafford standards.

But it is understood Giggs covets the vacancy created by David Moyes’ dismissal and wants his former team-mates to give him four successive victories to make his case.

He said: ‘I have a chance to show what I can do, what I am capable of as a manager in a short space of time. It has been a frustrating season and I want to end it on a high.’

And he appeared to receive backing from Sir Alex Ferguson, who said: ‘He’s the one man they should have gone to. He’s got 20-odd years of experience at United. I signed him as a kid at 13.

‘He’s gone through all the gamut of  emotions at the club; he’s experienced all the highs and lows. He knows exactly what’s needed to be a United player.’

Giggs knows a bandwagon of public opinion will start rolling if United beat Norwich comfortably this evening in the Barclays Premier League.

His appointment as temporary boss at his one and only club is a sentimental story and the  40-year-old played to the theme yesterday as he vowed to bring dashing, attacking football back to Old Trafford.

Beneath that, though, lies a determination to be taken seriously as a candidate as United continue their attempts to lure No 1 choice Louis van Gaal from Holland.

As it stands, Giggs has no chance of getting the job but he warned the players he will not tolerate failure.

Ringing endorsement: Giggs admitted he called Sir Alex Ferguson first to gain advice

Sacked: David Moyes has now agreed a pay-off deal with Manchester United after being sacked on Tuesday

‘I know the stadium will be bouncing 
for this game,’ he added. ‘The players have been really good in training
 this week and they are all excited as well.

‘There
 will be no prouder person than me walking out at Old Trafford. The 
hairs on the back of my neck will be standing up and I can’t wait.

‘I just want the players to enjoy themselves and give fans something to smile about in the remaining  four games.

‘We
 have dropped below Man United standards this season. I want to bring 
those standards back up to where a Manchester United player should be. 
And not just for one game, for every game. Every time you pull on the 
red shirt you give everything you have got, otherwise you’re coming off.

‘We
 have got four games to show what the players are capable of. That is my
 focus. After that, it is another conversation — we’ll see where it 
takes us.’

Giggs worked 
under Moyes as player-coach this season but has been as dismayed as 
anybody by how poor the performances were under the Scot.

Now the club’s most decorated player has a chance to put his stamp on things after first calling up Ferguson for advice.

‘I
 played under Sir Alex for so long,’ said Giggs. ‘He was the first 
person to call and I wanted advice and who better to ring? Why wouldn’t 
I?

‘He’s been through 
everything you can go through as a manager — as a young manager, as an 
experienced manager, as a successful manager.

‘Yeah,
 he’s given me advice, he’s told me that he’s always at the end of the 
phone and that’s obviously given me a lot of comfort and it’s good to 
know I can turn to the manager if I ever need him.’

Ferguson also praised Giggs’ move to reunite more members of the Class of 92.

He
 said: ‘I was so pleased he brought Paul Scholes back in, and Nicky Butt
 of course — two great professionals. They understand the club. They are
 hard workers. They are straight as a die. So you have got the right 
combinations there.

‘It is what we were doing in the last few years with bringing Butt into the fold, Ryan into the fold, Scholes into the fold.

‘Gary Neville was offered a position but he decided to go into television. He could easily come back.’

Ferguson,
 speaking at a charity event, praised Scholes in particular. ‘Paul is 
one of these guys who has few words but the few words are so succinct, 
accurate and to the point, he is brilliant at it.

‘Many
 times I would bring in the older guard to discuss certain things that 
we maybe wanted their opinion on. Scholesy had three or four words — 
bang, bang, bang ... he was such a revelation for me for a young man to 
be so positive, a decision maker.

‘Ryan
 will get the benefit of that now. That was the first thing Ryan did, he
 phoned up Scholesy, he was on holiday and called him back.’

First day: Giggs arrived for training as the new Manchester United interim manager on Wednesday

ON MOYES

'I'd like to thank David for giving me my first chance in coaching. It was something I'll always remember when he rang me in the summer and asked me to come on board. Obviously I was still playing but he's given me my first opportunity of a coaching role. Secondly to say how proud I am to be managing Manchester United for the remaining games.

'It's a club I've been associated with for 25 years and it's a proud moment for me and one I will enjoy. I've enjoyed the week and I'm proud more than anything. It's probably the proudest moment of my career and one I'm going to enjoy for the remaining two and a half weeks of the season and bring back some smiles onto the faces of the fans.'

ON MATCH AGAINST NORWICH

'I'll just look forward to the game just as I did as a player. You prepare yourself during the week and can't wait for Saturday to come, 5.30pm against Norwich, I know the stadium will be bouncing.

'The players have been really good in training this week and they are all excited as well. Everyone is looking sharp and I just want them to enjoy themselves and give fans something to smile about in the remaining four games. It's been a frustrating season and I want to end it on a high.

'It has been a difficult week for the club and it was a shock to me on Tuesday when I spoke to Ed and he informed me David was leaving and then asked me to take over. It's been a bit of a whirlwind week for me but one I've enjoyed - it has been different, chaotic and I've been getting a little taste as it's my fourth day in the job. I can never imagine what you have to do and things it entails being a Manchester United manager.'

ON BECOMING PERMANENT UNITED BOSS

'I'm just concentrating on a short time, the four games remaining, that's the main focus on Saturday and Norwich as it's going to be a tough game with them fighting for their lives. After that, I've not really thought about it.

'I've just given myself a five-year contract! While I can! I haven't done much this week but am still involved as a player as well. I've trained OK this week and looked sharp, to be fair! No, everyone has looked sharp, 20-odd players are in with a chance.

ANY MESSAGE FOR THE PLAYERS?

'I'll tell the players just to try to enjoy yourself, express yourself. I don't know if I'd be saying that as manager last week because the performance wasn't great but I've come into the job and my immediate aim is to win on Saturday and I felt just the way to do that is to make training as enjoyable as I can so they can go out and play and they have done that.

'It's going to be my philosophy, obviously the Manchester United philosophy as I've been here for all my career. I want players to play with passion, speed, tempo and be brave with imagination,  all the things that are expected of a Manchester United player. To work hard but, most of all, enjoy it. As a player I know if I'm enjoying the game I can express myself a lot more and that's what I'll be doing with the team tomorrow.

'It's been a frustrating season for everyone. We win together and lose together and in these remaining four games, I want to bring the positivity back. Three home games at Old Trafford, where the home form hasn't been great, and I want to see goals, tackles, players taking players on and getting the crowd up. I want the passion that should come with being a Manchester United player.'

SUIT OR TRACKSUIT?

'I haven't decided. You'll have to wait and see.'
