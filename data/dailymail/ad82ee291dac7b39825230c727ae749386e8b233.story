Ever get the feeling someone’s trying to make a monkey out of you?

By the dejected look on Bili the chimpanzee’s face he thinks Tesco are doing just that – after they stopped selling discount bananas to his sanctuary.

Fortunately for the 33-year-old chimp, Jan Garen, who runs the Wales Ape and Monkey Sanctuary in Abercave, near Swansea, took a more proactive approach to the problem.

The monkeys at Wales Ape and Monkey Sanctuary, in Abercrave, near Swansea, appeared unimpressed by Tesco's decision to cancel its supply of waste food to the centre. However, it has now changed its mind

Mrs Garen used to drive to Tesco to buy cut-price waste fruit, vegetables and other produce, until last September staff abruptly told her the special deal was over.

She wrote to the store manager asking for an explanation. But when none came she posted the letter on Facebook. It said: ‘It was very disappointing to be told that Tesco will no longer support the sanctuary. I have telephoned and left a message for you but having heard nothing I am writing instead.’

As she waited weeks for an answer, thousands read her post – and many threatened to boycott Tesco.

Tesco said it had changed its policy on supplying waste food and didn't want the monkeys to become ill

She was eventually told the supermarket had changed its rules because it didn’t want the monkeys to become ill from eating out-of-date food.

She said: ‘There is no way we would feed the monkeys anything we thought might put their health at risk.’

Tesco has insisted that it can no longer provide eggs, yoghurts and other fresh foods. But it has relented on discounted fruit and veg – and a steady supply is back on the menu again.

The fruit, veg and other fresh waste food is given to the 90 monkeys and apes who live at the sanctuary

The ape sanctuary spends about £5,000 a year on waste food from the supermarket for the monkeys

The ape sanctuary has bought waste food from Tesco at 10 per cent of the retail price for several years

However, the supermarket giant said it would continue to supply fruit and veg, but not eggs and yoghurts
