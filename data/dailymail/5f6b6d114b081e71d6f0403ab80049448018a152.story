A builder has been charged with the murder of a 58-year-old man who was found dead in a park yesterday morning following a suspected hit-and-run collision.

Malcolm Parkes, 50, will appear before magistrates in the Sandwell area of Birmingham later today accused of driving deliberately at Terence Powell, of nearby Wednesbury, in Jubilee Park shortly before 8am.

Police confirmed this morning that Parkes, a father of two, was arrested at his home in the Tipton area of the city 15 minutes after the man's body was discovered.

Officers were later seen examining a black Vauxhall Astra parked on Parkes' drive with a smashed windscreen.
