The piece of cloth stained with the blood of the late Pope John Paul has today been recovered in the basement of two of the men detained for stealing the reliquary last week.

Police believe that the men accused of stealing the cloth, both in their early twenties, are drug addicts, a press conference in L'Aquila, east of Rome, was told today.

The piece of blood-soaked cloth worn by the Pope when he was shot in a failed assassination attempt in 1981 was stolen on Saturday from a medieval sanctuary in the Abruzzo mountains.

Assassination attempt: The ampule contains a piece of blood-soaked cloth that dates back to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II on May 13 1981, in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City

Thieves sawed through iron bars on the 
window, officials said, and took the relic (left) alongside a crucifix. There 
was no CCTV or alarm in the chapel (right)

Thieves ignored other items and focused on this, giving rise to speculation that it was Satanists

Earlier this week, police recovered the metal frame used to hold the relic, following a search involving over 50 officers and sniffer dogs, but could not track the fabric itself until today.

Bishop Giovanni D'Ercole told the news conference in Rome, that he had pieced together the reliquary and the cloth.

The recovered piece of fabric was missing just a few filaments of cloth and gold thread, he said.

‘I think John Paul has forgiven them. I think we have to do the same,’ D'Ercole said of the men.

Two of the three men arrested over 
the theft were described as drug addicts aged 23 and 24 who were known 
to the police for a range of petty crimes.

A
 police spokesman said the men 'did not understand the relic's value' 
and 'cannot remember where they threw away the precious loot', according
 to a report by the ANSA news agency.

Close call: The Pope was shot and critically wounded when Mehmet Ali Agca (his gun is circled) shsot him four times while he was entering the square

Pope John Paull II is due to be declared a Saint in April this year at which point the value of the relic would increase dramatically.

President of the village cultural society, Pasquale Corriere, believed it had been a planned theft.

He said: ‘It was no doubt stolen to order. The thieves touched nothing but the relic and the crucifix.

‘They
 did not force the door of the sacristy or open the chest containing 
donations, which convinces me that [the relic] was the target’.

Venerated since medieval times for their healing powers, religious relics still have the power to draw crowds.

Grisly: Other remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an operation

A
 selection of artefacts associated with John Paul II is touring Europe, 
as the Vatican prepares to officially declare the former Pope a saint in
 April.

The relic was 
bestowed on the tiny sanctuary of Pietro della Ienca, on the mountain 
peak of Gran Sasso, where the pontiff used to take skiing holidays.

The relic was given to the chapel in 2011 by John Paul’s private secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz.

Other
 grisly remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock
 that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 
assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few 
days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an 
operation.

The mantle, 
which John Paul II was wearing when he was targeted in St Peter's 
Square, was secretly hidden by Dziwisz and its existence only revealed 
after his death in 2005.

Religious
 orders are vying for ampules of blood, taken by the pope's personal 
physician and sent to a hospital in Rome during his dying days in 
case a blood transfusion was needed.

One
 precious vessel of blood was almost lost in September 2012 when a 
priest carrying it on a train, near Rome, was distracted and robbed by 
three bandits. It was found just hours later lying in a field.

The
 relics were a crucial part of the campaign which saw John Paul II made 
the fastest saint in modern times. The event is to take place in 
record-breaking time just nine years after his death in 2005.

The last obstacle to his canonisation was cleared last year when doctors approved the second of two required miracles.

The Vatican maintains that to put a price on a sacred objects is sacrilegious.

But Ebay does a roaring trade in JP II relics with 'authentic' vestments worn by the late Pope starting at about $40.

In
 2007 the Vatican was overrun with nearly 200,000 requests for pieces of
 John Paul II's cassock after offering them for free on the internet.
