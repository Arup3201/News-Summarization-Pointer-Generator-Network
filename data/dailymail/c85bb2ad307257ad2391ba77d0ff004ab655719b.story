The Spanish media got stuck into Real Madrid after their disappointing draw against Valladolid, claiming they can wave goodbye to the La Liga title.

Humberto Osorio scored a late equaliser for the hosts in a 1-1 that also saw Cristiano Ronaldo hobble off injured.

The result leaves Carlo Ancelotti's side four points adrift of leaders Atletico with two games to play.

Gone for them! AS and Marca both splashed on Real Madrid all but giving up the La Liga title against Valladolid

Variation on a theme! Both Mundo Deportivo and Sport covered the development but with a Barca angle

And that, argue AS, is an unbridgeable gap.

'Adios Liga' reads their splash headline, while they claim Valladolid were able to get back into the game thanks to the exhaustion of Real.

Marca simply went with 'Madrid derails, leaving the league to Atletico or Barcelona.'

'I'm upset with the team,' Xabi Alonso said afterwards. 'They are moments that can not be repeated.'

Mundo Deportivo points out that the title is now incredibly in Barca's hands.

Winners! L'Equipe had Paris Saint-Germain as Ligue 1 champions as their main story on Thursday while Juventus' transfer targets Alexis Sanchez and Nani were hot topics of discussion in Tuttosport

There is some good news for Ancelotti, though. Ronaldo was taken off purely as a precaution and should be fit for the Champions League final in Lisbon later this month.

Over in France, Paris Saint-Germain were once again crowned Ligue 1 - even after losing against Rennes, while new Clermont Foot manager Helena Costa is handed a big blurb.

Tuttosport in Italy wrote a piece on Juventus' transfer plans this summer, with Manchester United's Nani and Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez interesting Antonio Conte.
