Steven Gerrard has admitted that England shouldn't have pushed for the late winner in their heartbreaking defeat against Uruguay, and instead should have settled for the draw.

His Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez gave the South American side the lead before half time, but a close range Wayne Rooney effort pulled the Three Lions level.

Roy Hodgson's side then spent the closing stages pushing for a winner, only to be hit by Suarez going the other way, and Gerrard knows that England should have been more cautious in their approach.

Acceptance: Gerrard admits that England should have controlled the game better in the closing stages

'We never managed the game well enough when we got the equaliser. We can’t give chances to Luis Suarez because he buries them from that position,' Gerrard told reporters after the game.

'I just thought we needed to be a bit more clever, a bit more cute and a bit more difficult to beat.

'Maybe accept that going for a point might have been the best option.

'At 1-1 as a team we sort of went for the second goal and maybe we should have been more experienced and gone for the draw.'

The 34-year-old spoke of his disappointment about England's campaign, arguing that their performances against Italy and Uruguay have warranted better than a pointless return.

'I’m sort of frustrated because looking at the two games and how we have performed, we sort of deserve something out of either one of them if not both of them,' he added.

'I don’t think I am standing here saying we were poor in both games and our gameplan was wrong.

'At this level it is such a cruel level. You can’t give world class players chances – that’s one thing – and when you are still in the game you need to be more difficult to beat and that was the disappointing thing for me.

'Italy are a fantastic team and capable of winning both games but we're clutching at straws.

The position we're in is the position we didn't want to be in coming into the tournament, relying on other people's results. It's very difficult at the moment.'
