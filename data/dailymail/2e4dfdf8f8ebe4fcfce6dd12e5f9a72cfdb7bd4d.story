A Pittsburgh mother has said that she 
feared for her life when she was attacked by a group of teenagers in the
 city's North Side on Sunday as they beat her while calling her racial 
slurs.

Ginger Slepski said that she suffered torn shoulder ligaments in the attack by the four black teenage girls which has left the electrician mother-of-two unable to work.

'I thought it was so animalistic,' said Slepski to WPXI. 'So violent. I'm afraid for these girls to get out and walk the streets.'

Attack: Ginger Slepski said that she was attacked in the street on Sunday by a group of black teenagers in a racially motivated incident

Police in Pittsburgh said that Slepski was attacked after one of the teens threw a bottle at her car as she was driving through the North Side of Pittsburgh.

'I was mad. I knew they were younger,' said Slepski. 'I thought they were in their early 20s. I got out and said, 'What is your problem?'

The four teens were African-American and have now been arrested by Pittsburgh police and face charges of ethnic intimidation and juvenile counts of robbery and conspiracy.

The names of the suspects will not be released by police, but all are between the ages of 14 and 16.

Slepski said that she tried to escape the girls when she realized she was outnumbered but one of the girls grabbed her by the hair.

'The one punched me in the head and I was on a set of concrete steps and my head hit the concrete so hard,' said Slepski to WPXI.

'Then they all got on top of me and all their hands were in my hair. They kept telling each other to, ‘Kick her in the head. Kick her head in the concrete.’

The mother-of-two said that the attack was witnessed by several people, but they were too scared to help.

'Another woman was yelling at the girls, ‘I’m calling the police!’ And it’s like it only made it worse,' Slepski said.

Eventually a man jumped in to separate the girls and Slepski and allow her to escape.

'I do feel like it was very racially motivated and I grew up in the neighborhood,' said the electrician.
