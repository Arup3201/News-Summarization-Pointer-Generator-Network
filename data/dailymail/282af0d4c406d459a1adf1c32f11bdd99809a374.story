'Nasty dream': Laura McGoldrick, 19, fled the room before her mother had hit the floor after being shot by Michael Atherton Snr. She is pictured on ITV's Daybreak this morning

A teenager who escaped through a window as her shotgun-wielding stepfather blasted three of her close relatives to death has described the harrowing experience as like a 'nasty dream'.

Laura McGoldrick, 19, said that Michael Atherton Snr aimed at her mother 'as if he was about to shoot a rabbit or a pheasant' before he opened fire.

The taxi driver killed Susan McGoldrick, 47, as well was Laura's aunt, Alison Turnbull, 44, and cousin, Tanya Turnbull, 24, in Peterlee, County Durham, on New Year's Day before turning the gun on himself.

Miss McGoldrick said she tried to shout a warning to her mother but she was unable to get the words out in time.

The teenager, who was hit by the spray of the shot, fled before she even hit the floor.

Relieving the moment her mother was killed, she told The Sun today: 'He walked into the house with the gun raised, aiming it at my mum's back.

'He had this focused, determined look as if he was about to shoot a rabbit or a pheasant. He definitely targeted my mum, he wanted her first. I wanted to get words out but my mouth wouldn't let me. It was like a nasty dream.'

The weapon was one of several firearms Atherton held legally.

During the attack, musical theatre student Miss McGoldrick managed to escape with her boyfriend Myren Grant, 19, through her bedroom window.

Her stepbrother Michael, the 17-year-old son of Atherton, 42, and Mrs McGoldrick, also escaped.

The teenager added: 'I am surprised he didn't run upstairs after me. I'm very lucky that I escaped. He would definitely have killed me if he had the chance.'

Miss McGoldrick described Atherton as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character with 'seven personalities' and revealed he had been violent towards her mother on numerous occasions in the past.

She also called for a change in gun laws to stop similar incidents occurring.

Durham Police said officers were called to Atherton's home four times between 2002 and 2004 because of domestic violence incidents.

The force said he had 'a volatile relationship' with his partner and had split up repeatedly.

They had been together 18 years but finally agreed to end their relationship for good days before Atherton opened fire.

She threw him out of the house last summer but he moved back in several weeks later after claiming he had a heart condition.

Miss McGoldrick said that her stepfather was abusive and had once left her mother with a black eye after attacking her.

An investigation is being carried out to work out why he was allowed to keep his weapons despite threatening to kill himself several years ago.

He became interested in shooting around a decade ago after Bobby Turnbull, Laura's cousin, introduced him to it.
