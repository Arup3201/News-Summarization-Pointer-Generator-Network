A teenage motorcyclist who killed an Olympics engineer when he did a 60mph wheelie into his car has been locked up for almost five years.

Ryan Birkett, 16 at the time, was ‘showing off’ on the stolen Triumph Sprint ST 955CC at more than twice the 30mph speed limit. He had never taken a motorcycle test.

Birkett failed to brake and smashed into a Peugeot 206 at a junction, injuring driver Bradley White and killing passenger Peter Tickner.

Mr Tickner, 23, was a childhood friend of Mr White and had helped set up CCTV cameras for the London Olympic Games. He died immediately when the bike completely embedded into the car, causing the door to buckle outwards and rip off the hinges, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Mr White, now also 23, suffered serious internal injuries including broken ribs. He was hospitalised for four days after the smash, said prosecutor Jocelyn Leward.

Birkett, now 17, has numerous previous convictions including driving without insurance or a licence in 2010. He was on bail for robbery at the time of the smash.

The construction worker broke his back and suffered nerve damage to his left arm, which is now partially paralysed.

The bike had been stolen from Barking and Dagenham College just hours before the collision, which happened as Mr White was turning right into Starmans Close from Goresbrook Road, Dagenham - a road notorious for accidents.

Carolina Guiloff, defending, suggested that Mr White, who has a clean licence, may have contributed to the likelihood of the crash by failing to look as he was turning into Starmans Close.

But traffic collision experts agreed that ‘excessive speed’ was the primary cause of the smash and there was no evidence that Mr White did not look properly, the court heard.

Ms Guiloff added that Birkett was deeply remorseful and wished to apologise to the families of Mr Tickner and Mr White.

Sentencing Birkett to 56 months in a Young Offenders’ centre, Judge Nigel Peters QC said: ‘You were no doubt showing off to your friends and seeking simply to drive dangerously.

‘The Crown cannot say if it was you who stole the bike but it must have been obvious as it had no key

‘The evidence that has been put before me is that you rode at an excessive speed then crashed into the side of the Peugeot driven by Bradley White.

‘Tragically in the passenger seat was young Peter Tickner.

‘Nothing said in this court can be of any assistance to the mother of Peter who sits in court and has suffered gravely and continues to suffer as a result of what happened.

‘This most horrific tragedy will be with her forever and the sentence I am obliged to pass can never deal with her grief.

‘The crash, it seems to me, occurred because you were driving a powerful bike without experience in a built up area at a greatly excessive speed.’

Judge Peters also banned Birkett from the road for six years and ordered that he must take an extended driving test.

Speaking outside the court, Mr Tickner’s mother, Dee, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, told how her son and his two sisters, Karol, 26, and Laura, 27, were her ‘little miracles’.

‘My son had everything to live for. He was at a stage in his life where he was extremely happy,’ she said.

‘He had a very good job as an engineer working at the Olympics and he loved his girlfriend, Nancy, to bits.

‘I knew from speaking to him the day before that he felt she was the one.

‘Every single day of his life, my son would never go out of the house without telling me how much he loved me and I have got those memories.

‘I had an incredibly difficult time having children and each one is a miracle.

‘Peter loved us all so much. Just before this happened, I felt everything was coming together, despite me being so ill.

‘In that morning, when he got up, he had no idea that his life was going to end that day.’

Ms Tickner, who lives moments away from the crash scene in Starmans Close, told how the family are constantly reminded of their loss.

Speaking about Birkett’s sentence, Ms Tickner added: 'It is far better than we expected, the judge did us proud and went as far as he could go.

‘Justice has been done as far as the courts are concerned. Justice for Peter will be if that lad comes out and is a good person, and learns from what happened.’

‘To this day, Bradley will always be heartbroken. Bradley and Peter grew up together and went to school together.

‘He had a huge number of friends, more than 250 people attended his funeral.

‘He was the kind of boy you couldn’t help but smile, he was cheeky, a lad that people loved.

‘Often people would say to me “You have done well, he is a cracking lad.”

‘Our world was turned upside down that day and there is a hole which can never be filled.’

In memory of Mr Tickner, his family and friends have so far raised £4,000 for road safety charity Brake.

Birkett, of Dagenham, east London, admitted death by dangerous driving and causing aggravated vehicle taking.

Judge Peters allowed Birkett's name to be publicised, despite his age, 'to discourage others who may feel the need to ride powerful bikes in built up areas'.
