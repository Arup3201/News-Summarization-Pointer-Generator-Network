With a fitness regime that involves spending three hours a day in the gym and a carefully controlled diet Charlotte Anderson, 26, has certainly earned her place in the final of the British Bodybuilding Championships.

The Somerset athlete has been dubbed 'Britain's hottest firefighter' and has impressed colleagues with her dedication as well as judges in the 'body fitness' category.

And Charlotte has repaid the compliment to her colleagues, saying her gruelling training with Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service has helped hone her incredible physique.

Muscular: Charlotte will be taking part in the body fitness category at the British Bodybuilding Championships

Gruelling: Charlotte puts her physique down to her challenging job combined with three hour workouts

'I am not scared of weights or sweating,' said Charlotte, who hails from Shepton Mallet in leafy Somerset.

'There is plenty of time to look girly when I get dressed up and go out, but when I'm at the gym it's the same as being at the fire ground, it's both sweat and stamina.'

Charlotte is a retained firefighter at Shepton Mallet fire station.Â 

Single Charlotte started lifting weights when she joined the retained fire service three years ago.

'I wanted to keep up with the boys on the fire rounds,' she said.

'It's
not that I don't like asking for help - especially in a crucial 
situation - but I didn't want to be a girly-girl out on the fire calls.'

Charlotte, who also has a full-time office job, added: 'I get a lot of banter at the station about my competing.

'I
took my trophy in and I think they are really pleased for me but they 
do make jokes about it - I think that just shows that they do support me
though.

Natural: Body fitness requires muscles that aren't too pumped up plus beauty pageant style presentation

Impressive: Charlotte juggles her workouts with her role as a retained fireman and a job at the local council

'They call me "Guns" quite a lot and if something is really heavy they say "don't worry we can get Guns on it".

'But they are really supportive and put up with my mood swings which I get sometimes on the low carb parts of my diet.

'Being in the retained fire service is a really mix when it comes to helping my training.

'Sometimes
we will be out on lots of jobs, which is great for fitness, but does 
make me tired when it comes to trying to fit in my personal fitness.'

She won second place in the bodyfitness category at the South West Classic Bodybuilding and Open Championships last month and will now compete in the final.

'It's called body fitness and the goal is for a more natural look to the muscles than bodybuilding,' she of the competition.

'Girls are expected to have pageant appearances, so they are marked on looks and hair as well as muscle tone and size.

'I have been on a pre-competition diet for the last four months which means eating every three hours with a strict exercise regime of at least three hours a day.

'Typically I work two muscle groups at a time in a four day spilt. I train by myself which is hard but push bigger weights every time.

'I am hoping to work up to the next class of physique but lean muscle will take years to obtain naturally but is worth the patience and dedication.'

The final of the British Bodybuilding Championships takes place later this month in Harrogate.
