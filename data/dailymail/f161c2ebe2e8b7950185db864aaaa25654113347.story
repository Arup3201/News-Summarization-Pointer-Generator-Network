Russia and Ukraine inched closer to war  yesterday after ‘many’ pro-Moscow separatists were killed during a major military offensive to seize back a rebel-held city.

As fighting flared in the east of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin said the operation had ‘destroyed’ any hopes of peace.

The Kremlin said Kiev’s decision to deploy the army against its own people was a ‘catastrophe’ and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.

The crisis plunged closer to all-out conflict after government special forces launched a major ‘anti-terrorist’ drive to snatch back the key eastern city of Sloviansk.

Mr Turchynov said: ‘The criminals suffered heavy losses – many were killed, wounded and taken prisoner.’

But the operation in the rebel-held city was not going as quickly as hoped, he said on TV, and was ‘greatly complicated’ by the conflict taking place in population centres.

Mr Turchynov said two Ukrainian army personnel were killed in the fighting and accused pro-Russian forces of hiding behind civilians and hostages. He urged the Russian president to ‘stop threats and intimidation’ amid widespread belief that the Kremlin is supporting the militants.

Even the police have been injured while attempting to prevent the rival protesters from clashing

Missiles: The first gunship was blasted out of the sky with a surface-to-air missile over the city of Slaviansk this morning, Ukraine's Security Service said, while the other was forced to land under heavy attack

Fierce fighting: It comes as Ukrainian forces stormed the city this morning, desperate to flush out militants who have seized a number of government buildings

In response, a Putin spokesman said the
 military operation launched by Kiev meant the Geneva agreement to 
defuse the crisis was no longer viable.

‘At
 the same time that Russia is taking pains to de-escalate and regulate 
the conflict, the Kiev regime has begun shooting up peaceful towns with 
military helicopters and has started a punitive operation, essentially 
destroying the last hope for the viability of the Geneva agreement,’ 
said spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

TV
 footage from Sloviansk showed several members of the Ukrainian forces 
bloodied and being given medical aid while behind them barricades 
blazed.

Up to 50 hostages are being held in the city, including six Western monitors seized more than a week ago.

Nine
 checkpoints were said to have been taken by Ukraine command forces on 
roads into the city as troops prepared to move against heavily armed 
forces holding several state buildings and police stations.

Ready for battle: A Pro-Russian gunman runs behind barricades in Slaviansk. The action came a day after Putin said that Ukraine should withdraw its military from the eastern and southern regions of the country

Waiting: Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops along the Ukrainian border as it warns Ukraine's military not to move against the insurgents in the east

Battle fatigue: Ukrainian soldiers rest near of a checkpoint seized not far from Slaviansk. The Ukrainian Security Service said its forces were fighting 'highly skilled foreign military men' in the city

Fierce resistance: The Ukrainian interior minister, Arsen Avakov, said in a statement that government troops met fierce resistance, but had managed to take control of nine checkpoints on roads around Slovyansk

Separatists launched reprisals by seizing control of the main railway station at Donetsk.

With
 40,000 Russian troops and armour on the border there were fears the 
military offensive could be used as a reason by Mr Putin to order them 
to cross into Ukraine.

In 
Odessa, police said more than 40 people had been killed and 50 wounded 
in clashes between supporters of Kiev and pro-Russian activists.

Meanwhile,  Secretary Philip Hammond yesterday warned Russia not to attack 
Nato nations as RAF fighter jets patrolled the skies over eastern 
Europe. He urged Mr Putin not to breach a ‘red line’ by making a land 
grab against increasingly anxious Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia – all 
members of the defence alliance.

Mr
 Hammond hinted Britain could send more troops to the area to deter the 
Kremlin from invading the ex-Soviet states – raising fears the UK will 
be sucked deeper into the crisis.
