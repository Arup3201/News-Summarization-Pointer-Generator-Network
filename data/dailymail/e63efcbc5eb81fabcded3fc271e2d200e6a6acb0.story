Disciples of a millionaire spiritual guru have refused to have him cremated because they say he is meditating - in a freezer.

Now the wife and son of His Holiness Shri Ashutosh Maharaj, who is said to be worth £100million, have reportedly launched a court battle to retrieve his body after saying he died in January.

His followers at the Divya Jyoti Jagrati Sansthan (Divine Light Awakening Mission) insist he is just in a 'deep meditative state', and called on followers to stand by his 31-year-old sect 'under all circumstances'.

He's not dead, he's restin'! Disciples of religious guru His Holiness Shri Ashutosh Maharaj (pictured) say he entered a meditative state on January 29, so they put him in a freezer and are still waiting for him to wake up

Described as 'an exceptional awakened being with a divine persona' whose 'ever-enthusiastic charisma has re-kindled a spirit of a positive aura and has directed many towards a constructive path across the globe', the guru founded his Hindu order in 1983 and is in his seventies.

There are missions in his name around the world, including the U.S., Canada, Switzerland, Germany and even a British base in a small suburban house in west London.

But according to reports, doctors declared the guru clinically dead of a heart attack on January 29 - a verdict his loyal followers refused to accept.

Insisting he was in a deep spiritual state called samadhi, they placed him in a deep freezer on the outskirts of the Punjab city of Jalandhar and waited for him to wake up.

Four months later, they are still waiting.

In the meantime they say their leader 
has been grateful for the many phone calls, e-mails and even personal 
visits he has received.

Now the spiritual guru's wife and son Dilip Jha, 40, have filed a court claim to obtain his body for cremation and have called on police to investigate his death, according to the Daily Telegraph.

It comes after a previous court challenge to the placing of the guru in a freezer by a man claiming to be his former driver.

It was alleged his followers were keeping him in the guarded freezer so they could claim a share of his vast wealth.

Mission spokesman Swami Vishalanand said scores of spiritual leaders throughout history had survived after months of samadhi in the Himalayas, which have freezer-like conditions.

'[He] is still sending messages through followers in their meditative stage to protect his body until he returns,' Mr Vishalanand added.

A statement on the religious order's website said: 'His Holiness Shri Ashutosh Maharaj ji has been in deep meditative state (Samadhi) since 29th January 2014.

'Divya Jyoti Jagrati Sansthan appreciates innumerous individuals and organisations for re-affirming their commitment to the organisation through phone calls, emails, messages and personal visits.

'The sansthan acknowledges your pledge to stand by the organisation under all circumstances.'

Reeta Kohli, additional advocate general of Punjab state, said previously: 'The man is clinically dead and it is up to his followers to decide what they want to do with the body.'
