An 11-year-old Celtic superfan with Down's Syndrome has been announced as the winner of the Scottish Professional Football League Goal of the Month for January after being invited to take part in a half-time penalty shootout challenge.

Jay Beatty, of Armagh, accompanied Celtic for their 2-0 defeat of Hamilton on January 19 where he met players and was asked to take part in a shootout challenge during the interval - in which he duly obliged and scored before celebrating wildly in front of Celtic fans.

And he was announced on Friday by former Celtic striker Georgios Samaras as the winner of the competition after receiving 97 per cent of the votes cast on the SPFL website, beating the likes of David Goodwillie and Gary Mackay-Steven.

The youngster, who has Down's Syndrome, was given a rapturous welcome by both sets of supporters

Known affectionately as 'Wee Jay', the youngster captured the hearts of a nation when he was plucked from the crowd by Samaras to join in last year's title winning celebrations.

A video of him enjoying Celtic's lap of honour was shown live on Sky Sports and gathered over two million hits on YouTube after going viral. 

Despite losing 2-0 to Celtic last month, Hamilton had the good grace to include Beatty's strike in their final score, announcing it as 3-0 to Celtic on Twitter.

Samaras, who has since left the club and currently plays for Saudi side Al Hilal on loan, was so taken with Beatty that he invited him to last year's World Cup in Brazil.

Samaras said: 'Jay my friend. Me and you, we're the same now, scoring goals. I'm very happy to announce that you won the goal of the month.

'Well done pal, great job. I miss you and I love you.'
