Ed Miliband held private talks in his Commons office with the  disgraced Co-op Bank boss embroiled in a drugs scandal, it emerged last night.

The revelation left the Labour leader facing potentially damaging questions about his relationship with the Reverend Paul Flowers.

Flowers is being investigated by the police after being caught on film apparently buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth.

Co-op last night announced a complete review of the fiasco, as Labour leader Ed Miliband faced questions over hiring Flowers as a business adviser

But last night it emerged that Flowers had enjoyed astonishing access and influence at the top of the Labour establishment for years.

Labour sources confirmed that Mr Miliband had personally appointed Flowers to his elite Business and Industry Advisory Group in 2010 — and even invited him for private talks in his Commons office last year.

It also emerged that Flowers described Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls as a ‘political friend’ and boasted of helping to arrange a £50,000 donation for him from the Co-op last year.

Both Mr Miliband and Mr Balls deny being close to Flowers, who was suspended by Labour last night for ‘bringing the party into disrepute.’

A spokesman for Mr Balls, one of 32 Labour MPs sponsored by the Co-op, said he had never held a meeting with Flowers and never discussed the donation with him.

The near-collapse of the Co-op Bank is embarrassing for Labour, which has long ties with the organisation.

Last year Mr Miliband hailed the firm as the future of banking in a speech at the its headquarters.

And many MPs receive financial support from the Co-op, including shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie, shadow Europe minister Gareth Thomas and shadow constitutional reform minister Stephen Twigg.

Labour’s Business and Industry Advisory Group was set up by Mr Miliband to provide him with personal advice on business policy.

Flowers was one of 20 members of the group, which held meetings in 2011 and 2012.

It has now been superseded by other Labour business forums.Asked about the appointment yesterday, Mr Miliband said: ‘He was involved in the Co-op and that is no longer the case.

I think we will leave it there.

You appoint people from a whole range of backgrounds to look at a whole range of issues and we have a range of business people working with us.

‘The police are looking into the matter and I’m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation. Suffice to say that group no longer exists. We should let the police inquiry take its course.’ 

Labour was last night unable to shed light on the meeting Mr Miliband held with Flowers at the Commons in March last year, describing it as a ‘private meeting’.

But sources said it should come as ‘no surprise’ that the chairman of the Co-op Bank, which has historic ties to Labour, would be asked for advice on issues such as banking reform.

In evidence to MPs earlier this month, Flowers said Mr Balls  had played a pivotal role in  supporting legislation that enabled the Co-op Bank’s disastrous 2009 merger with the Britannia Building Society.

The Co-op gave Labour £750,000 in donations in 2009, the year the Britannia merger went through. Labour also benefits from a  £1.3 million loan from the cash-strapped Co-op.

A spokesman for Mr Balls, who was the keynote speaker at the Co-operative Party’s gala dinner this year, insisted he had few dealings with Flowers.

He said: ‘Ed’s been to a few events which Paul has also been at, but he’s never had a meeting or phone conversation with him.

'The Co-op group donated £50,000 to the shadow chancellor’s office, which was declared in the normal way. Ed has never discussed the donation with Paul Flowers.’ 

Flowers became the first former Co-op boss to reveal the enthusiasm of Mr Balls for the disastrous 2009 merger with Britannia, which helped bring the lender to its knees.

While he denied political interference, he said: ‘Balls was particularly supportive of us – talking to us and encouraging us.’

Flowers said Mr Balls was not at the Treasury at the time but was the Schools Minister.

A Treasury Select Committee also heard Mr Balls has a close relationship with the bank’s parent, the Co-operative Group, which gave his office £50,000 in donations last year.
