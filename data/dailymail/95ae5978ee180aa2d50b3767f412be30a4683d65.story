Bridesmaid Caitlyn Box stood out for all the wrong reasons at her cousin's Sydney nuptials when she was forced to wear black after leaving her matching wedding party dress on the 381 bus to Bondi.

Desperate efforts to find the Grecian-style cool-grey dress failed despite a massive social media campaign backed by hundreds if Sydneysiders trying to help.

In the end, Ms Box had to wear a dark dress different to the two other bridesmaids, and she's relieved the bride has been very understanding about it all.

After bridesmaid Caitlyn Box realised her horrible mistake she desperately called police, bus and train services and placed posters of the dress along the bus route offering a $200 reward

'They are calling me the black sheep... I match the boys' ties,' Ms Box told Mashable. 

Jet-lagged after an eight-hours-plus flight from London, Ms Box did the unthinkable last week. After picking up her bridesmaid dress she accidentally left it at the back of the 381 bus which runs from the city to Bondi in Sydney. 

After realising her mistake, Ms Box desperately called police, bus and train services and placed posters of the dress along the bus route offering a $200 reward.

She tried to find a replacement, but the dress in the original colour had been discontinued.

Ms Box's predicament made it's way to social media and cries for help were passed around on Twitter and Facebook.

Sadly, the dress was not found in time for Friday's ceremony at Bradley's Head in Sydney and Ms Box was forced to wear a black dress since the original  light grey dress had been discontinued.

Ms Box told ninemsn.com.au she had just had flown in from London when she picked up the dress and was not feeling well from jet-lag.

She said ever since she lost the dress  she had been frantically attending the police station to see if anyone handed it in.

'I honestly thought it would get handed in,' Ms Box said.  

Social media users took to Twitter urging Sydney residents to help find the dress.  

Although the dress drama has added stress to bride Jessica's day, Ms Box admits her cousin was fine about it and just wanted the day to be enjoyed.

'It wasn’t what we expected. I’m fine, what am I going to do about it?,' Jessica said. 

'It’s just a dress and there’s not much she can do about it. As long as everyone’s having a good day.'

Unfortunately for the bride the dress was not found and tonight Ms Box was forced to wear a black dress since the original light grey dress had been discontinued
