Ray Rice attended a football game at his high school in a New York City suburb and was greeted with open arms despite being suspended from the NFL following his recent domestic violence scandal.

WABC-TV in New York reports that the recently released running back attended the game at New Rochelle High School with his wife, Janay Rice, and their daughter in New Rochelle.

Rice was released by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL on Monday after video of him punching his then fiance Janay was released.

Previously, he had been suspended two games by the league and the Ravens organization had announced its support for him.

The New York Daily News reports that students at the school and the football coach said that they were happy to see Rice back at his alma mater.

'Ray is a part of our family, and a part of this program and that's why I'm happy he's here today,' said New Rochelle Huguenots coach Louis DeRienzo.

'I know the character of the man and he will rise from this.'

A 17-year-old senior named Justin Watson told reporters that he still respects Rice even after video surfaced of him beating Janay.

'He's from New Rochelle, he's done a lot for us so we support him,' Watson said.

'We really have a lot of love for him and instead of kicking him down we want to help him back up.' 

The case has put the NFL in an uncomfortable spotlight as it faces criticism for how it handles cases in which players are accused of domestic violence.

The schools superintendent for New Rochelle, Brian Osborne, said in a statement emailed on Thursday that 'our community stands united in the belief that physical violence to settle differences cannot be condoned.'

The high school also removed Rice's jersey from its wall of fame and took down a placard honoring him.
