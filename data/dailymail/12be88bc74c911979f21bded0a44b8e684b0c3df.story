Ronnie O'Sullivan became snooker’s most prolific century-maker as he cruised into the Masters semi-finals on Thursday.

The five-time world champion eclipsed the record of Stephen Hendry as he recorded his 776th career ton in the first frame of a convincing 6-1 win over Marco Fu at London’s Alexandra Palace.

‘I was a bit nervous because I knew everyone was thinking about it, so to get it out of the way was nice,’ O’Sullivan told the BBC.

‘But there was still a match to play — at 1-0, I was like, “calm down”.’ The 39-year-old received a standing ovation after rattling in a break of 101 to get his match off to a perfect start.

O’Sullivan had equalled Hendry’s mark of 775 in Tuesday’s win over Ricky Walden. Hendry, whose record of 42 wins at the Masters tournament was also surpassed by O’Sullivan, was commentating for the BBC as O’Sullivan reached his record-breaking ton.

‘It hasn’t been in doubt from very early on,’ said the Scot. ‘Every shot has been cued to perfection.’ Fu immediately levelled the match but O’Sullivan ground out the next two frames before easing to victory.

O’Sullivan was clinical in the later frames, notably punishing Fu for missing a risky plant in the fifth and a red with the rest in the seventh.

The victory took five-time winner O’Sullivan through to the semi-finals of the tournament for an 11th time.

He said: ‘Marco is playing consistently well, so I knew it was going to be a tough match. He is at the business end of most tournaments and he always plays well against me, so I knew I had to be on my game.

‘The first four frames were a bit hit and miss but I was pleased I was able to not get frustrated and drain every bit out of them that I could.’
