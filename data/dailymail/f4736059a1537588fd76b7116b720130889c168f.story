If you have only just managed to switch your TV to digital, bad news - you may soon have to buy yet another box.

A parliamentary inquiry today forecast a second wave of switchover as TV moves online.

The House of Lords says the government should begin planning for every channel to be available online to free up spectrum for services like high speed mobile phone services.

The 219 metre tall Crystal Palace broadcast tower. Experts say it could soon be replaced by online TV services.

'Eventually the case for transferring the carriage of broadcast content, including public service broadcasting, from spectrum to the internet altogether will become overwhelming,' the Lords communications committee said in its report on internet infrastructure.

It comes as gadget makers around the world are turning their attention to the living room.

Last week YouView boxes, which combine freeview digital TV services with on demand internet services such as iPlayer, went on sale in the UK.

Apple is also rumoured to be developing a fully integrated TV, while Google already sells its own Google TV box.

For consumers, however, the choices can be overwhelming, especiallyÂ  just months after the country's 26m television households had to retune their sets from analogue to digital, a process that started in Cumbria over four years ago and reached London in April.

Digit Al during the digital switch over in Whitehaven. The Cumbrian town was the first in the UK to to switched off from the analogue transmitter.

The Olympics has also seen a big increase in the number of people watching TV online.

However, the report also warned that broadband would need to be improved in rural areas.

'If broadcast services move to be delivered via the internet,' said committee chair Lord Inglewood, 'then key moments in national life such as the Olympics could be inaccessible to communities lacking a better communications infrastructure.'

Services such as YouView require a connection of at least 3 megabits per second.

With an estimated 14% of UK homes 
unable to get even 2Mbps, according to telecoms watchdog Ofcom, large 
swathes of the population could be left out of the next phase of the TV 
revolution.

Government targets promise only that everyone will be able to get 2Mbps by 2015, with 90% getting 24Mbps.

Ed Vaizey defended the government's plans to improve speed.

'We have set ourselves a target that 90% of the country will have superfast broadband by 2015,' he told the Today programme.'We spend more money and more time online and have a big marketplace between BT and Virgin covering two thirds of the country.

'Government intervention is needed to reach the rest. 50million will support this.

'We don't just want high speeds but a competitive market and Europe look to us as leaders in this.'
