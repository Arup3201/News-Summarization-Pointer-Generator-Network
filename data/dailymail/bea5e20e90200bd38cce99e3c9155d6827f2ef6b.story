The FBI revealed on Tuesday it is investigating whether 'high-speed trading' companies, which use ultra-fast computers and complex algorithms to complete transactions, are guilty of insider trading.

Authorities are scouring for possible illegal scenarios such as if a high-speed, or high-frequency, trading firm has used fast-moving, information not available to other investors to trade ahead of market rivals.

High-speed trading and other 
potentially illegal practices on Wall Street have come under increasing 
scrutiny from regulators recently.

The agency said its probe, called the 
'High-Speed Trading Initiative,' was launched about one year ago and is 
still in the early stages, FBI officials told the Wall Street Journal.

The FBI has deployed a large number of
 agents, looking at proprietary-trading outfits as well as fast-trading 
operations at brokers who buy and sell orders on behalf of clients, such
 as mutual funds and pension plans.

'There are many people in government who are
 very focused on this and who are concerned about it and who think it 
breaks the law,' an FBI spokesman told the Journal.

'There is a big concern that 
high-frequency traders are getting material nonpublic information ahead 
of others and trading on it.'

The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority are among the regulators helping the FBI to investigate.

Over the past four-and-a-half years, insider trading charges have been brought against 90 people, 79 of whom have either been convicted or pleaded guilty. None have been acquitted.

News of the investigation comes one day after best-selling author Michael Lewis released a new book claiming some high-frequency traders on Wall Street use their speed to rig the market for their own advantage.
