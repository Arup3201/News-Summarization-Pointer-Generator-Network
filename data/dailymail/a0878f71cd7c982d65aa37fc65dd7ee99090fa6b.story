Anderlecht players have been enjoying life off the pitch at a charity gala surrounded by a host of Miss Belgium 2015 finalists.

The ‘Fashion and Sport event’ in Charleroi raised money for two associations with an auction ending the third successive gala.

One lucky bidder won a dinner date with the eventual winner of Miss Belgium, announced next January, with a bid of €1,850.

The Anderlecht squad and Miss Belgium finalists raised funds for Constant Vanden Stock foundation and Justine 4 Kids which is the organization of former tennis player Justine Henin.

The Belgian Pro-League leaders, who are two points clear of FC Bruges, dented Arsenal’s Champions League campaign by cancelling out a three goal deficit at the Emirates to draw 3-3 earlier this month.

Former Manchester City and Bayern Munich defender Daniel Van Buyten also appeared at the gala
