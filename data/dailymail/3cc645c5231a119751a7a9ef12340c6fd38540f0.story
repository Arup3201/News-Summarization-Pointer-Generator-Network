To successfully launch its payment service in the UK, Apple will need the backing of major retailers and banks across the country. 

But sources are claiming that talks with such firms and institutions are proving difficult. 

In particular, one major British bank is said to be 'uncomfortable' with how much personal and financial data Apple wants to collect about its customers.  

Reports claim that talks between Apple and one of Britain's biggest banks have 'proved tricky'. This could mean the release of Apple Pay in the UK is delayed. Alternatively, Apple may decide to launch without signing a deal with the unnamed institution. The service is expected to launch in the UK early next year

The service is expected to launch outside the US early next year, but the precise date has not been revealed. 

Reports in the Telegraph claim negotiations between the tech giant and at least one of the UK's biggest banks have 'proved tricky because of wrangling over the terms, including what data Apple will be able to access.'

This wrangling could mean the release date is pushed back. Alternatively, Apple could decide to launch the service without signing a deal with the unnamed bank.

Apple has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. 

When it launched Apple Pay in the US earlier this year, the tech firm was tight-lipped about when the service would rollout to other regions.

Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers.

It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button.

This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card.

All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely.

If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service.

Apple Pay is currently available in more than 220,000 shops, and 17 banks, in the US.

Visa has already said it is working with Apple to bring the service to the UK next year.  

But a recent job listing inadvertently let slip the service is on its way to Europe, the Middle East, Asia, India and Africa.

The listing, first spotted by iClarified, has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or Apple wasn't ready to make the announcement. 

Apple boss Tim Cook announced Apple Pay at the launch event for the firm's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September.

The service launched in the US in October and is currently accepted by more than 220,000 retailers, and 17 banks in the country. 

Visa's Pedro Sousa announced shortly after the launch that it was working to bring Apple Pay to the UK 'early next year', but no specific details were given. 

The recent job listing bolstered Mr Sousa's comments Apple Pay may launch in the region within months.

According to the listing: 'Apple Pay is a new and exciting area that is set to expand across Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. 

'The new London-based Apple Pay team will work to drive the rollout of this technology by working with a variety of internal and external partners, as well as issuers, payment networks and merchants across Europe.'

In particular, Apple is said to be looking for an intern to handle non-disclosure agreements and contracts with these partners.

There was a related listing, posted in China, for an Apple Pay Site Reliability Engineer.

According to a recent job listing, a new London-based Apple Pay team will work to drive the rollout of Apple Pay (pictured at its launch with Apple boss Tim Cook) by working with a variety of internal and external partners, as well as issuers, payment networks and merchants across Europe

However, the rollout may be gradual, especially in Europe, as Apple will need to get the approval of the European Union Council of Ministers, in addition to signing deals with multiple retailers and banks.

The ministers recently recommended new rules for mobile payments.

EU legislators said that any payment service must have 'strong customer authentication', and licences may be required for individual states.

The rollout could equally be brought forward following news Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival. Sources said the tech giant is in talks with LoopPay.

However, the rollout could equally be brought forward following the news earlier this month that Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival.

Sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones.

Samsung has previously allowed NFC payments on certain networks and with partners including Barclaycard, but if it teamed up with LoopPay, the service would be expanded more widely.

LoopPay calls itself a ‘wallet solution’ that lets customers pay with their phones and tablets ‘virtually everywhere’. 

It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a phone case. 

The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards. 

These can be used to pay for shopping in 90% of shops and banks in the US.

Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader.

LoopPay calls itself a ‘wallet solution’ that lets customer pay with their phones and tablets ‘virtually everywhere’.

It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a specially-designed phone case.

The sources revealed that Samsung is already in talks with the Massachusetts-based provider, and prototypes have been created, but there is no word on when the service will launch - if at all.

If the firms do partner up, LoopPay’s technology could be built into future models of Samsung devices, including phones, tablets and smartwatches.

The LoopPay app securely stores all payment cards including credit, debit, loyalty and gift cards.

These can be used to pay for shopping in 90 per cent of shops and banks in the US.

Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader.     

Samsung has previously partnered with the likes of Barclaycard and China's UnionPay, among others, to offer NFC-enabled mobile payment services (Samsung graphic illustrated) to select customers. But its deal with LoopPay would make these services more widely available
