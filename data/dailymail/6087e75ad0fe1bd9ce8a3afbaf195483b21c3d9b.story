Standing at the altar with beaming smiles, the couple show off their wedding rings in front of dozens of amused guests.

This selfie of Andrew and Sally Rose Robinson - taken just seconds after they tied the knot - has won the World Selfie Awards 2014.

The couple, both 30, had just exchanged vows when they borrowed the best man's iPhone and took the photo at Christ Church in Treales, Lanchashire.

Although they left many guests stunned, they had already gained permission from the vicar to snap the selfie as a 'bit of fun'.

We're married! This selfie of Andrew and Sally Rose Robinson, both 30, was taken just seconds after they tied the knot at Christ Church in Treales, Lancashire. The incredible image has won the World Selfie Awards 2014

They then decided to submit it to the global competition, run by online smartphone retailer Mobiles.co.uk, after seeing an advertisement for it online.

Mrs Robinson, a nurse at Royal Preston Hospital, said: 'I'm not really into Twitter or things like that but Andy saw the competition on there and decided to send it in - I had no idea.'

Mr Robinson added: 'I joked about taking a selfie at the wedding rehearsal as all our friends take them when we are out, but thought I'd be too nervous to do it on the day. As it turned out I wasn't, so we decided to go for it, with the vicar's approval, on my best man's iPhone.

'We thought the photo looked great, especially with the family in the background, so we put it on Facebook and it went huge.' 

Success: Tom Morton, who snapped a selfie with singer Miley Cyrus, won the 'Celeb Photobomb' award; one of five available in the contest. Right, another entrant manages to capture the Duchess of Cambridge in his snap

The couple, who met at secondary school and got engaged two years ago at the top of the Empire State Building, married on June 7.

Mrs Robinson described their wedding selfie as 'nice, fun thing to do', but said it had left some of her elderly relatives a bit confused.

'A few of my older relatives were a little confused as they couldn't really figure out what we were doing,' she said. 'But if other people feel like doing it at their wedding, they should just go for it.' 

Mr Robinson, a chartered surveyor, added that he was 'surprised' to hear the image had scooped first prize in the Awards.

Having a laugh: Other entries into the competition included a man posing in front of a model dinosaur (left) and a woman smiling with a magician seemingly floating in the air in the background

'I was surprised when I heard we'd won and actually checked to see if it was for real as we've never won anything before,' he said.

The couple, who are currently living in Manchester but will shortly be moving to Preston, Lancashire, beat more than 300 entrants to win the top prize.

They will now receive a smartphone of their choice and a crystalised award etched with a permanent reminder of their selfie. 

Mobiles.co.uk, run by Carphone Warehouse, asked members of the public to share their best selfies for the chance to win one of five awards, including the top prize won by the Robinsons, 'The WTF Selfie' and 'Celeb Photobomb'.

Bizarre: Abby Francis, from Mobiles.co.uk, said: 'Selfies have become a viral sensation thanks to the smartphone, so we thought we'd challenge people to really show us how it's done'. Above, two more entries

The winner of 'Celeb Photobomb' was Tom Morton, who snapped a selfie with singer Miley Cyrus.

Other entries into the competition included a young man standing just metres away from the Duchess of Cambridge, another posing in front of a model dinosaur and a woman smiling with a magician seemingly floating in the air in the background.

Abby Francis, from Mobiles.co.uk, said: 'Selfies have become a viral sensation thanks to the smartphone, so we thought we'd challenge people to really show us how it's done.

'Hopefully, Mr and Mrs Robinson will keep up the good work with their new smartphone.'
