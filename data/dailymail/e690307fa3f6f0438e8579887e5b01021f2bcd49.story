A woman who reacted to taunts about her appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show by smashing a glass in a bride-to-be's face was jailed for five years today

Mother-of-one Jennifer Eckley, 27, scarred victim Lucy Steers for life when she glassed her at her engagement party at a hotel in Newent, Gloucestershire.

Ms Steers, a 28-year-old nurse, has been left with a v-shaped scar on the bridge of her nose and is to undergo plastic surgery next week.

Scarred: Mother-of-one Jennifer Eckley (right), 27, scarred victim Lucy Steers (left) for life when she glassed her at her engagement party at a hotel in Newent, Gloucestershire.

She has been off work with depression 
since the attack last December and her relationship with her fiance 
Craig Mortimer has broken up.

During
Eckley’s trial at Gloucester Crown Court the jury was told that two 
years before the assault she had appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show.

She was involved in a programme about domestic abuse.

Afterwards, the jury heard, she regularly had fun poked at her in her home town of Newent about her appearance on the show.

She told the jury in evidence that she realised now she had been ‘silly’ ever to take part in the programme.

The
court heard that on the night of December 1, Eckley was at a hen party 
at the George Hotel, in Newent, at the same time as Ms Steers’ 
engagement party.

Scene: The incident took place at the George Hotel (pictured), in Newent, on the night of December 1

After 
comments had been made by people at the hotel about her Kyle show 
appearance Eckley walked up to Ms Steers and jabbed a glass into her 
face.

It broke Ms Steers’ nose and caused a 2cm cut on the bridge of the nose and two other facial cuts.

In
a victim impact statement read to the court, Ms Steers said: 'I have 
been told by the consultant that the scarring will be permanent.

'I now have to live with it as a constant reminder for the rest of my life.

'I feel my scar has made me look like someone who fights and people will judge me by it.

Hearing: Eckley has been jailed for five years following a trial at Gloucester Crown Court

'My relationship with Craig has ended. It was a 19 month relationship and this incident has left me feeling distraught.

'I
have only just started going to the shops again. I have been signed off
my work until the case is finished owing to me being diagnosed with 
depression.

'My father has 
given up his job (he was a manager at the George Hotel). I know he 
wishes he had been working that night so he could have prevented it. I 
feel like I am responsible for this.'

Jailing
Eckley, who has a young daughter, the judge Recorder Richard Davison, 
said she had received only ‘minimum provocation’ yet she had made a 
‘determined and deliberate’ attack on Ms Steers.

Show: During Eckley's trial the jury was told that two years before the assault she had appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show

'You
caused her devastating injuries - scarring a pretty young woman for 
life,' he said. 'We have seen the photographs (of her injuries) and they
are horrific.'

Eckley, a 
childminder, from Newent, had denied wounding Ms Steers with intent to 
cause her grievous bodily harm on December 1 last year but was 
unanimously convicted by the jury.

She was cleared of a second charge of assaulting another woman, Kate Taylor, at the engagement party an hour earlier.

She
admitted a charge of assault by beating Ms Taylor’s sister, Nicola, 
whose hair she pulled when she saw her in the pub and realised she was 
her partner’s ex-girlfriend.

During
the trial prosecutor Julian Kesner told the jury the engagement party 
'should have been one of the happiest days in Lucy Steers’ life - but it
became one of the worst.'

Just before she glassed Ms Steers, Eckley told her: ‘I suppose you think you’re a f****** pretty bitch - well you won’t be now.'

Later, when she was arrested, she told police she would never get work as a childminder again because she had glassed someone.

However, she denied to the jury that she had a glass in her hand.

In evidence she claimed Ms Steers had been among people who taunted her about the Jeremy Kyle show on the night of the attack.

She said she told Ms Steers ‘I’m glad you find my pain funny. You don’t know what I have been through.'

Eckley claimed Ms Steers told her she had found the show hilarious and had Googled it to watch it again.

'You
caused her devastating injuries - scarring a pretty young woman for 
life. We have seen the photographs (of her injuries) and they
are horrific'

- Recorder Richard Davison

Later,
she alleged, she got into a scuffle with Ms Steers but they were both 
fighting each other and she did not have a glass in her hand. She said 
she did not know how Ms Steers got injured or how her own hand was cut.

Before
Eckley was sentenced today her solicitor Jason Coulter asked the court 
to accept there had been ‘at least a degree of provocation, albeit mild’
from Ms Steers to cause Eckley to attack her.

Her reaction was a ‘spontaneous moment of blind madness’ which was totally unjustified, he added.

He
handed the court testimonials for Eckley who, he said, had been hoping 
to make a career in child minding and had been due to start training in 
January this year.

Mr Coulter told the court that Eckley’s appearance on Jeremy Kyle had been ‘about an abusive relationship with another.’

'As
a consequence of that she was the subject of some discussion and 
perhaps tittle tattle in the small Newent community prior to this 
particular night.'
