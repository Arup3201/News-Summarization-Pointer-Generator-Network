As the stars line up on the red carpet at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles later today, there will undoubtedly be a number who have resorted to a bizarre and controversial cosmetic ‘pick-me-up’ in a bid to look their best.

The celebrity trend for injecting vitamins directly into the body has been endorsed by everyone from actress Jennifer Aniston and singer Katy Perry – who reportedly does it to perk up her bottom – to supermodel Cara Delevingne and pop star Rihanna, who are said to rely on the jabs as an antidote to their hard-partying lifestyles.

Now, patients have another option. It’s called mesotherapy and involves having the infusions directly under the skin on the face, in an effort to reverse environmental damage from sun exposure, pollution and stress, and even cellulite.

Before and after: Martine Lush opted for mesotherapy treatment shortly before her 40th birthday last summer and said she saw results almost immediately 

Insiders claim Hollywood A-listers opt for this facial treatment over cosmetic surgery or other more aggressive treatments prior to ‘awards season’ as the results are subtle and there is little down time.

And now UK clinics offer mesotherapy as a ‘natural’ alternative to anti-wrinkle injections of Botox and fillers, and which can also be ‘done in your lunch hour’. 

Some clinics are even offering huge discounts of more than 70 per cent on group purchase websites.

But the trend comes with a warning. Dr Patrick Bowler, medical director of Courthouse Clinics and co-founder and fellow of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, says: ‘There is little clinical data to back up the often exaggerated claims. 

'It sounds wonderful to inject all these essential elements into the skin, but think very carefully before you agree to go ahead.’

And the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery says it will not endorse mesotherapy until further research validates its effectiveness.

Cheeky girl: Injections gave Katy Perry a 'derriere lift' 

In South America, companies are barred from claiming it can remedy the dimpled skin of cellulite, while in Australia there were reports the treatment resulted in a number of patients developing skin abscesses on their calves, buttocks, thighs, abdomen, shoulders, face or neck.

The treatment takes its name from the mesoderm, the middle layer of the skin, which is penetrated during the procedure. 

This involves dozens of ‘micro-injections’ delivering a cocktail of Vitamins A, B, C and E, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, elastin and moisturising hyaluronic acid. 

This, say advocates, stimulates fibroblasts, the skin cells that produce collagen – a protein providing the firmness that becomes depleted with age.

Full effects are apparent after two weeks with, typically, two to four treatments spaced two to three weeks apart needed. Sessions cost from £180.

Nurse Benjamin Kauffholz, co-founder of Dr Maurice Dray’s clinic in London, where a facial version of mesotherapy, the Mesolift, was pioneered, says: ‘We recommend this from the age of 30 onwards, two or three times a year for the best effect. 

'It’s like using the best anti-ageing cream for a year, but all in one go.’

One patient to have braved the needle is Martine Lush, who runs a bed-and-breakfast in Dorset. 

She opted for mesotherapy treatment shortly before her 40th birthday last summer. 

She had been reluctant to try other injections such as Botox, the jab that paralyses facial muscles, and so smooths out the lines and crevices that expressions such as frowning create.

She says: ‘The discomfort of mesotherapy is akin to having your legs waxed, but bearable. Afterwards, I was left with just a few tiny little cat-like scratches on my neck, which I could cover up with foundation.

‘I could see a difference in my skin immediately. I looked much fresher. My husband could see straight away too, and he was impressed. Over the next two weeks I saw the full effects develop. My skin was plumper and more dewy and the tone was better, much less blotchy. I like to get a tan on holiday and I am a smoker, so the treatment made a difference. My fine lines were reduced and I looked like a more youthful, glowier version of me.’

Martine also had Dr Dray’s ‘10-Minute Facelift’, involving injections of a gel containing chemicals called Biphasic Tricalcium Phosphates (BTCPs), costing £400.

She says: ‘After turning 40, I left my job in advertising to run the B&B by the sea with my husband. My younger-looking face matches my new, less stressful lifestyle.’

Three ways to treat Varicose veins

Varicose veins can lead to complications such as blood clots, eczema and venus ulcers (file image)

PREVENT: Varicose veins develop when the valves inside the veins stop working properly. If these valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein, leaving it swollen and enlarged.

Not only are they unsightly, but they can lead to complications such as blood clots, eczema and venus ulcers. 

Professor Andrew Bradbury, professor of vascular surgery at the University of Birmingham, says: ‘Old age, being overweight and pregnancy can increase your chances of developing them, but it can be down to genetics.’

He adds: ‘Being on your feet a lot can exacerbate the condition – many of my patients are doctors, teachers and hairdressers – so try to transfer your weight from one foot to the other if you have to stand still for long periods. Compression stockings also help to improve circulation.’

TREAT: Prof Bradbury says your first port of call should be your GP, who should refer you to a specialist for an ultrasound to look at the extent of the problem.

‘The best way to get rid of varicose veins is non-surgical treatment to block off the affected vein so it dies,’ he adds. 

‘This can be done with endothermal ablation, which uses radio waves or lasers to seal the veins, and foam sclerotherapy, where foam is injected into your veins to seal them. Only 15 per cent of people see the veins coming back eight years after treatment.’

DON’T BOTHER: Topical creams containing ingredients such as Vitamin E are marketed to ease swelling, but there is insufficient evidence to prove they are effective. 

Also avoid ‘stripping’ surgery, which involves tying off the vein and removing it. The procedure can cause bleeding, pain and nerve damage or deep-vein thrombosis in more serious cases.

The operation: Keyhole surgery for Endometriosis 

Endometriosis is a condition affecting 1.5 million UK women, where cells that behave like the ones in the lining of the womb grow elsewhere in the body. 

These cells react to the monthly menstrual cycle and also bleed, but there is no way for this blood to leave the body. 

This leads to pain, swelling and sometimes fertility problems if the fallopian tubes or ovaries are damaged. In laparoscopic, or keyhole surgery, small incisions are made in the stomach so the endometriosis tissue can be destroyed or cut out using a laser, heat or electric current. 

The surgeon says

Consultant gynaecologist Caroline Overton, a member of charity Endometriosis UK’s medical advisory panel, says: ‘The surgery is performed under general anaesthetic, but I aim to have patients home the same day. I’d book two weeks off work so you can concentrate on getting back to your best.

‘You will be tender because of the cuts in your stomach, so you can feel period-type pains or that you’ve done too many sit-ups. The rule of thumb is don’t try to lift anything heavier than a kettle or a bag of shopping for a few days.

‘Don’t spring out of bed in the morning. Instead roll on to your side, drop your feet on the floor and come up sideways. Baths are fine, but go for a quick dip rather than a long soak. Your appetite will also be affected, so stock up on easy-to-digest, quick-to-prepare foods such as soup.

‘You should be fine to return to work at the end of the two weeks, but driving could take longer. Practise getting in and out of the car and if you feel uncomfortable, don’t start the engine.’

The patient says

Rosie Gedling, 32, an office manager from Manchester, had keyhole surgery in May 2014.

She says: ‘The pain after the procedure was uncomfortable, but not unbearable. I booked four days off work but should have taken two weeks as I felt quite delicate sitting at my desk all day as my tummy was still sore.

‘I was told it might be a few days before I felt better, so I made sure I filled the fridge and tidied round the house.

'I'm glad I did as going to the supermarket or doing the hoovering was the last thing I was thinking of. 

'The one thing I wish I’d known was that they fill your stomach up with gas during the operation. Although it is released, I was left with a bloated feeling. Peppermint tea was a godsend.'
