A man has been given a record sentence for poaching rhinoceros horns in an elaborate fraud involving ‘fake hunts’ with Thai prostitutes in South Africa.

Thai national Chumlong Lemtongthai was sentenced to 40 years in jail by for shipping large quantities of rhino horns to Asia for ‘selfish financial gain’.

Mr Chumlong, 44, paid the prostitutes $800 go to game farms and pose next to rhinos killed by others to provide proof the horns were souvenirs.

Jailed: Thai national Chumlong Lemtongthai has been handed a record 40-year jail sentence for an elaborate fraud to ship poached rhinoceros horns to Asia

It is legal for foreigners to hunt rhinos in South Africa and ship horns overseas as long as it is for personal trophies.

Judge Prince Manyathi said Chumlong fraudulently obtained hunting permits to kill 26 rhinos and then shipped most of the horns to Asia to sell for a profit.

‘The shooting was not for trophy hunting. It was for horn trading,’ Manyathi said, adding rhinos were a symbol of the country and continent.

‘We cannot allow anybody to take our pride away.’

South Africa is home to almost all of Africa's rhinos and has been in an escalating arms race with poachers who smuggle horns to China, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere. Its value there as a medicine is about $65,000 a kilogram, making it more expensive than gold.

Chumlong did not make any statement when he was handed his sentence but his lawyers said they planned an appeal.

Chumlong pleaded guilty on Wednesday to more than 50 counts of illegal exports and violating environmental protection laws.

The environment ministry said the 
sentence was the longest ever handed out for rhino poaching. It was also
harsher than the minimum term for murder.

Between October 2010 and May 2011, 
more than two dozen rhinos were killed on licensed 'hunts' arranged by 
Chumlong. The horns were mounted as trophies and sent  to the owner of a
wildlife trading firm called Xaysavang Trading Export-Import in Laos

In 2011, Chumlong signed a deal with the South African owner of a hunting reserve requesting horns from an additional 50 rhinos, with a street value of about $20 million, according to documents obtained by Reuters.

Increased demand meant poaching has hit record levels in South Africa where, by mid-October, 455 rhinos had been killed illegally. There were 448 in 2011.

Poaching increased dramatically from about 2007 as a growing affluent class in east and southeast Asia began spending more on rhino horn where it is believed by many to prevent and cure cancer.

According to some studies, rhino poaching has reached a level that is causing species decline.
