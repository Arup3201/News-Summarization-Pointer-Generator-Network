Pitting animal against animal in football, racing and looks, the Chitwan Elephant Festival in Nepal aims to remind people of their responsibility to wildlife.

In its 11th year, the festival is run by Chitwan Regional Hotel Association (RHAN), which is made of a coalition of 100 hotels in Sauraha - a village south-west of Kathmandu.

This year it ran for five days from Friday to Tuesday and features major events including an elephant race, elephant calf football, elephant beauty contest and elephant picnic.

The festival took place over five days from Friday through to Tuesday, and marvelled crowds at the spectacle

Other attractions include the ox cart race, horse cart race and canoe race. 

The use of the feature animal in the events is to raise awareness of the endangerment of Asian elephants.

At the beginning of the 20th century, it is thought more than 100,000 of this species were found in areas of Iraq and Syria to the Yellow River in China, according to the World Wide Fund.

But this count has plummeted by at least 50 per cent in the past 60 to 75 years, with the population now only existing from India to Vietnam, and in sparse numbers in the south-west corner of China's Yunnan Province.

About 100 elephants were expected to compete during the festival and wow the crowds.

RHAN President Gyanendra Kumar Bista told Xinhua a total of 20 elephants would be hitting the track for the race, eight elephant calves would be playing the field during the football match, and five majestic animals would face off in the beauty pageant.
