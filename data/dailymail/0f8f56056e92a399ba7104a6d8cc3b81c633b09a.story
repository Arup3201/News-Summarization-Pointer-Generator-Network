A wanted criminal who posted 'Yall will never catch me' on a police department's Facebook page has, perhaps inevitably, found himself back in custody.

Roger Ray Ireland, 28, from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, posted a comment on Wednesday on his own wanted poster after he violated probation.

'Yall will never catch me', he wrote in a since-deleted post. He was captured on Thursday at 1pm in south Baltimore during a traffic stop.

Police thanked the public for helping them track down Ireland, 28, who was pulled over during a traffic stop on Thursday

Ireland had been featured as one of Anne Arundel County Police Department's #WantedWednesday stars.

After Facebook users began tagging his family members in the comments section, he also wrote: 'Yo all yall people tagging my hole family bout my [business] stay ... outta [my business].'

Police said that tips from the public led to Ireland's arrest.

He was due in court on Friday morning.

Police Chief Kevin Davis wrote on Facebook: 'Community involvement is paramount to law enforcementâ€™s success and the amount of tips that we receive daily on social media shows how much ownership citizens are taking in their own communities.'
