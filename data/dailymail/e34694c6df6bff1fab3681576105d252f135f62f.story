A new study has found that a third of female university students in the UK have been sexually assaulted (pictured posed by model) 

A third of female university students  have been sexually assaulted with almost half of them admitting they didn't even report the attack to their family, according to a new survey.

The study found that 31 per cent of female students polled said they had experienced 'inappropriate touching or groping' while at institutions in the UK.

It also found that 43 per cent of those who had experienced unwanted advances did not report it to the university or even their family and friends.

The study carried out by research group YouthSight for the Daily Telegraph comes amid calls by charities for new guidelines warning higher education institutions could be breaching the law by not investigating reported sexual abuse.

It also found that one in eight men who responded said they had been groped or had unwanted advances.

Meanwhile more than half of the women and a third of men polled said they knew of someone else who had experienced behaviour ranging from touching to rape.

Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, told the paper: 'It is unacceptable that a third of women and 12 per cent of men said they had faced unwelcome sexual advances.

'It is crucial that those on the ground, the students, feel confident and safe enough to take active steps when they witness a problem, or experience domestic harassment themselves.'

The new study comes just months after universities were accused of failing to combat a widespread ‘lads’ culture’ which has seen unwanted sexual advances and jokes about rape become commonplace.

Student leaders warned that harassment was ‘rife’ on campus after another survey also found that more than a third of female students have been groped or touched inappropriately and almost two thirds said they had heard jokes about rape or sexual assault.

The same survey also revealed a lack of awareness of procedures in place at universities designed to tackle inappropriate behaviour, with 60 per cent saying they were unaware of any codes of conduct written by their university or their students’ union.

Speaking at the time, Laura Bates, from the Everyday Sexism campaign, said: ‘Students are experiencing sexism, sexual harassment and assault within the university environment.

‘It is worth mentioning that one category of such experiences “inappropriate touching and groping” actually constitutes sexual assault under UK law.' 

However Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, added: ‘If alleged criminal behaviour is involved, all universities would support any students reporting such incidents to the police.

'It is important to remember that this is an issue for society generally, not just one confined to university students.'
