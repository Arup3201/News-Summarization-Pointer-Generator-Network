Video has emerged showing the moment a woman was rescued from an 18ins gap after she fell between two buildings.

She had to be pulled 25ft up the building by 30 firefighters after getting stuck while leaping across the roofs of buildings in Santa Ana, Orange County, last night.

It is not known why the 28-year-old woman was jumping across the rooftops of the commercial buildings, but she was taken to hospital to be treated for scrapes to her arms and legs.

Predicament: The woman was stuck for over an hour in a gap 18 inches wide

Images show the unidentified woman in some distress as she waited for emergency services to rescue her.

According to firefighters she initially got stuck 5ft down but then managed to wriggle another 25ft to the floor. A harness was lowered and she was eventually pulled free.

At first she fell just five feet between the buildings, then ‘scooted down to the bottom’, Captain Steve Concialdi, from the Orange County Fire Authority, told KCAL9 news.

Captain Steve Concialdi, from Orange County Fire Authority, told KCAL9 news ‘It was a challenge. Our urban search and rescue firefighters had to be lowered into a very tight space and tie a harness around her.

'She was scraped, she was scared. But they were able to carefully pull her up, get her on the roof, and they lower her down.

‘She was able to stop herself about 
five feet up, and was able to scoot down all the way to the bottom – but
 she couldn’t move left or right,’

The woman was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, where she received treatment for moderate arm and leg injuries.

Stuck: The woman was unable to move left or right
