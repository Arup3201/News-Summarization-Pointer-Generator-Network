A conman known as 'Moneybags' has had his 1922 Rolls-Royce seized by police as they attempt to recover the $17 million he stole from the New Zealand government.

New Zealand fraudster Michael Swann's Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost is expected to earn between $60,000 and $80,000 at auction in Auckland this week.

The sale comes after the IT man previously had his other assets, including dozens of luxury cars, vintage motorbikes, speed boats, houses and even an old fire engine auctioned off in 2013.

Michael Swann's Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost was discovered in a shipping container

The vintage car was discovered in a container at Port Otago's Dunedin container yard last year, according to the Otago Daily Times.

Police said Swann paid $160,000 to a man in Christchurch in 2004 for the car.

'It is an English built car and comes with copies of original build, ownership and service records,' Turners Car Auctions said.

The vintage car was made in 1922 and is expected to earn $60,000-$80,000 at auction

Michael Swann (left) was jailed in 2009 for a $16.9 million fraud against a health board. Mr Swann's house (right) at 14 and 24 Ferntree Dr, Wakari, Dunedin, was bought for $644,000 and sold for $585,000 at auction in 2013

It was reportedly built in 1922 but rebodied in 1934 in Buckinghamshire, England.

Mr Swann was released from jail a year ago after he was convicted of defrauding Otago District Health Board of nearly $17 million.

He was jailed in 2009 after he stole millions of dollars of public money while working for the DHB as the Chief Information Officer.

One of Mr Swann's many vintage cars that were seized: A Jaguar E-Type V-12, bought for $75,000 and sold for $53,000

His collection boasted this 1969 Mercedes-Benz 280SL bought for $65,000 and sold for $58,000

He owned a 1990 Porsche 928, bought for $24,000 and sold for $13,000

He made up dodgy invoices and charged the government $16.9 million for IT-related services that were never provided.

During his serious spending spree, he claimed he had hit the jackpot with a software programme bought up by computing giant Microsoft.

He reportedly spent the proceeds of his crime on a holiday house in Wanaka, a collection of luxury cars such as a Lamborghini and six boats.

Mr Swann had more than one Rolls-Royce. He also owned this 1938 Phantom III, bought for $200,000, and sold for $97,100

And his taste for vintage vehicles even extended to a 1911 Cadillac 30 Saloon, bought for $54,000 and sold for $56,000

He claimed to own 20 4x4 vehicles, including this Toyota Landcruiser (left). He also had a 1942 Willys Jeep (right) bought for $10,000 and sold for $13,000.

This Land-Rover 64/65 was bought for $17,800 and sold for $15,200

During his High Court trial, former colleagues told how he would drive to work in his Lamborghini.

Swann earned a $145,000 salary, which he gave to his then wife Anna Devereux, but scooped on average $43,000 a week from his fake contracts.

He told the court he had 19 cars and more than 20 4x4 vehicles.

The IT specialist owned his very own ship, the 'Townsend Cromwell'. Bought $826,000 and sold for $650,000

This Rinker Captiva 282 boat and trailer, bought for $96,239 and sold for $44,500, was seized

One of three inflatable boats which he paid $109,867 for was sold for $35,800

Mr Swann even owned a random Isuzu fire engine bought for $40,000 and sold for $9000

An auction in November last year saw his his historic home in Dunedin sold for $585,000, his Wanaka holiday home sold for $482,000, a large white ship sold for $650,000 and a 1924 BSA motorbike sold for $13,000.

A cream Jaguar E-Type V-12, bought for $75,000, was auctioned of for $53,000 and a 1969 Mercedes-Benz 280SL bought $65,000, was sold for $58,000.

Any proceeds of the sales of his many assets are being returned to the government.

He owned a holiday home in Wanaka which he bought for $700,414 but it was sold for $482,000

More properties: This house Careys Bay (left) was sold for $130,000 and this house in Dunedin (right) was sold for $250,000
