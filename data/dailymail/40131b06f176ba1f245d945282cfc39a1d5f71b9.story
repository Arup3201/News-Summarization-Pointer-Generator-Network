It may have been a bit of struggle to get it on, but this polar bear seemingly looks quite pleased with his new fashion accessory.

The large bear took some time out from his day to apparently model the latest fashion trends, much to the amusement of onlookers at Prague Zoo, Czech Republic. 

After some minor adjustments the bear places the tyre onto his head before appearing to strike a number of poses, while one of his friends dubiously looked on. 

The animal was captured on camera by amateur photographer Stanislav Duben who spotted the bear experimenting with the tyre.
