A former NFL player’s home was broken into and thoroughly trashed by teenagers in upstate New York over Labor Day weekend.

Brian Holloway, a three time all-pro lineman for the New England Patriots, arrived to his second home in Stephentown on Tuesday to find it covered in urine, graffiti and empty cups and booze bottles.

While he and his family were in Florida, the area high schoolers broke into the $1.5 million house and then with the help of Twitter quickly attracted hundreds of their peers from miles around.

Trashed: The $1.5 million upstate New York home of the former All-pro NFL lineman was broken into and then trashed by 300 partying high schoolers over Labor Day weekend

Now Holloway, himself a father of 8, 
has used the same social media methods to gather 100 of the kids’ names 
and posted their Twitter messages and photos to a site called 
HelpMeSave300.

‘So my 
apologies, I don’t really know what else to do,’ writes Holloway on HelpMeSave300.com. ‘ It’s been quite a gut shot dealing with all of 
this.  I guess I’m still in shock.’

Holloway decided to channel the shock into action.

‘But I want to aside the very strong emotions I’m feeling and focus on the one thing that is extremely clear the lives of these 300 students.  I want them to live. I’ve seen too many young people die because of excessing partying, drugs and alcohol.’

Lovely: The 5,000 square foot dream home, seen here in a before photo, became a nightmare for Holloway. But the former athlete immediately decided to take action

Word quickly spread: Twitter helped turn the party into a drunken madhouse as word of it spread from Albany, New York to Pittsfield, Massachusetts

Wild party: Twitter helped fuel the madhouse and teens flocked to the Stephentown home from miles around

Former linebacker: Holloway, a father of 8, says he's more concerned about the welfare of the teens involved than he is with their apparent crime

Sprawling: The 5,000 square foot, four bedroom home suffered $20,000 in damages. Holloway came up Tuesday from his first home in Florida to clean the property, which has been listed for sale for several years

The site he’s created features extensive photos of his trashed 5,000 square foot second residence.

Grafitti covers walls, widows appear smashed, and plastic cups and beer bottles litter every surface of the four-bedroom home.

Along
 with the aftermath photos, Holloway has made the decision to post 
photos and messages he’s gathered from the social media accounts of the 
partygoing teens.

‘What is even more dangerous and shocking beyond the crimes, drugs and alcohol,’ he writes, ‘was reading the tweets and hearing them celebrate their destruction and documenting their crimes.’

Evidence: Many of the estimated 300 teens documented the illegal party by Instagramming and tweeting pictures and messages about the event. Holloway has, in turn, posted the messages on a website he calls HelpMeSave300

'I¿ve seen too many young people die': Holloway's home, which is currently for sale, was in shambles after the event and he wants the world to know it in order to help the teens

'I came back to clear my conscience, say "I'm sorry" to him in person, shake his hand,' Nelson (pictured) said.'I bought him an apology card, and gave that to him.'

Teens: The high schoolers took photos of themselves and tweeted about the party. Now Holloway has turned over a mountain of digital evidence to the police

Holloway estimates the teens did $20,000 worth of damage to the New York home, which he has on the market for $1.5 million

'Tonight was a blur': The teens tweeted in the aftermath of the party, as well. Holloway says he's collected the names of 100 of the estimated 300 attendees and turned them over to police

He includes the faces of the teens and their social media screen names in an effort, he says, to teach them a lesson.

News
 spread for several days after at least one teen broke into the house. 
Twitter posts show momentum building for the Stephentown party.

Teens posted photos of their raucous behavior during the party and then Tweeted about it the day after.

One teen wears a backpack with a sign that reads, ‘$2 cups for kegs.’ The same teen is later seen walking atop a kitchen counter.

Determined: ¿We need to take a stand and respond as a community,¿ he said. ¿The next flash party, I guarantee you, is being planned right now, and it's not going to be at my house. It's going to be at someone else's¿

¿300 dreams can be recovered,¿ says Holloway. ¿The 300 are at a key turning point, the decisions they made to commit crimes, drink illegally, destroy property, selling drugs and do drugs are dangerous decisions¿

The former athlete cleaned up his house Tuesday with the help of several area high schoolers and their parents.

While he’s turned the criminal part of the case over to local police, Holloway is now on a mission to save the kids who trashed his house and those like the,.

‘300 dreams can be recovered,’ writes Holloway. ‘The 300 are at a key turning point, the decisions they made to commit crimes, drink illegally, destroy property, selling drugs and do drugs are dangerous decisions.’

Holloway is determined to stop the next party from happening.

‘We need to take a stand and respond as a community,’ he said. ‘The next flash party, I guarantee you, is being planned right now, and it's not going to be at my house. It's going to be at someone else's.’
