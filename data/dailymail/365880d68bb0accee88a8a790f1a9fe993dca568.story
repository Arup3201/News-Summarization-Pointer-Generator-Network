British world champion boxer Kell Brook is in hospital in Tenerife after being stabbed in the leg while on holiday.

Blood was left spattered in the street after the 28-year-old was attacked at 6am today following a night out in the Spanish island's popular tourist resort of Golf De Sur.

He was visiting with his pregnant wife Lindsey just two weeks after being named the International Boxing Federation's welterweight world champion in a tense fight in California.

Stable condition: Brook was being treated at Candelaria hospital as police remained at the scene of the attack

Aftermath: Blood was splattered on the pavement after the stabbing as police cordoned off the area

A spokesman for his promoters Matchroom said the star was in a stable condition, and a source close to Brook said he was conscious and had suffered a cut arm.

The boxer, from Sheffield, had been enjoying a night out in Golf De Sur when the attack happened.  

An eyewitness to the aftermath told Sportsmail the attack left a trail of blood 100m long, leading to an apartment where an ambulance was called.

The 28-year-old won a career-defining victory last month when he defeated rival Shawn Porter in Los Angeles.

The Sheffield star had already been through a long career which included 32 professional fights before earning his shot at the IBF welterweight title.

Challenging legendary Manny Pacquiao as early as 2010, he nevertheless faced a slow rise from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas.

Victory over Argentinian veteran Hector Saldivia two years ago moved him into position to fight then-champion Devon Alexander, but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled.

Instead, he faced the undefeated Porter, ousting the champion to become the sixth Brit to hold a world title in the division and the first since Ricky Hatton's brief stint in 2006.  

Brook was being treated tonight at Tenerife's Candelaria hospital as police remained at the scene of  the attack.

A spokesman for the Spanish police, the Guardia Civil, said: 'This morning a 28-year-old British man was stabbed at Golf del Sur in San Miguel de Abona.

'He was stabbed in the left leg and is hospitalised. He lost a lot of blood.

'There are no arrests at this time and the Guardia Civil are investigating.' 

Brook was on holiday with his heavily-pregnant wife, Lindsey, who is expecting their second child. She left earlier in the evening and was not present when the altercation happened.

Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn has not yet been able to speak to the boxer but said he planned to fly out to Tenerife tonight.

He said: ‘I will be flying out tonight to see what is going on. We are all worried about what has happened.

'There are a lot of stories out there so let’s just wait and see. I am told he is stable.’

It is the second time Brook has been stabbed after he was attacked outside a nightclub in Sheffield in 2007.

He was leaving the Cactus Club when he was stabbed in the side and buttocks. His trainer at the time, Dave Coldwell, said he had been attacked by ‘kids from a car that pulled up’ next to him.

Brook returned to fight six months later and has since amassed a perfect record of 33 fights and 33 wins.  

In action: Brook turned in a gutsy display to beat Porter and line up a potential fight against Amir Khan

He won the IBF world title from American Shawn Porter in California last month, and was being lined up this week for a major fight next spring against two-time world champion Amir Khan.

Hearn wrote in a column for MailOnline earlier this week: 'Talks are ongoing over a fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan. It is going well because I think everyone realises it makes sense.

'Khan obviously wants a fight with Floyd Mayweather, as does everyone in the division, but he knows that while that fight might never happen, even if it did he would make more money fighting Kell.

‘Everything so far has been very straightforward and I am in talks with Wembley over a May date. They want us back there as soon as possible after the success of Froch-Groves – I have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again. I hope to have this tied up in the next month or so.’ 

Hearn failed with a previous £3million offer to Khan to fight Brook, but the situation is believed to have changed after the boxer's world title win. 

Brook's promoter said: 'There are a lot of stories out there so let’s just wait and see. I am told he is stable’ 

In training: Brook on a run in his hometown of Sheffield in 2010. He has enjoyed a steady rise to fame

Rising: Brook is unbeaten in 33 fights. He was scheduled to return to the ring in December before the attack
