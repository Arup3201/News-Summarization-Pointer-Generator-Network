A best-selling author who has based her literary career on writing about the Royal family has launched a bitter attack on the Duchess of Cambridge.

Hilary Mantel used her position among the novel-writing elite to make an astonishing and venomous critique of Kate.

Mantel, whose latest books are set in England's Tudor court and have appeared on the New York Times bestsellers' list, dismissed Kate as a ‘machine-made’ princess, ‘designed by committee’.

Attack: Author Hilary Mantel called the Duchess of Cambridge a 'shop window mannequin' who was 'designed by a committee' with a plastic smile

Mantel, 60, also scorned her as a personality-free ‘shop window mannequin’ with a ‘plastic smile’.

She
 compared Kate unfavorably to both Anne Boleyn – one of her historical 
heroines – and to Princess Diana, insisting both had more personality.

She
 said Kate had gone from being a ‘jointed doll on which certain rags are
 hung’ to a woman whose ‘only point and purpose’ was to give birth.

Mantel
 said Kate ‘appeared to have been designed by a committee and built by 
craftsmen, with a perfect plastic smile and the spindles of her limbs 
hand-turned and gloss-varnished’.

She said the Duchess was quite unlike Anne Boleyn, who was ‘a power player, a clever and determined woman'.

Mantel
 contrasted her appearance to Prince William’s mother, Diana, ‘whose 
human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every 
gesture’.

Pretty as a picture: The Duchess of Cambridge pictured at a viewing of her portrait, in which Hilary Mantel said she has 'dead eyes' and looked 'strained'

Mantel, the author of Wolf Hall and Bring Up
 The Bodies, the acclaimed novels 
which detail the failure of Henry VIII’s wives to produce an heir, used a lecture to examine the prospects for the future queen consort.

Mantel
 said that when she first saw Kate Middleton, she struck her as ‘a 
shop-window mannequin, with no personality of her own, entirely defined 
by what she wore'.

Writer Hilary Mantel was born in Glossop in Derbyshire, England in 1952.

She
 is the first woman to receive the prestigious British literary award, the Man Booker Prize, twice. She bagged 
the first of the awards in 2009 for Wolf Hall, part one of her trilogy 
about Henry VIII’s adviser Thomas Cromwell.

The
 second installment of the trilogy, Bring Up The Bodies won both the 
Booker Prize and the Costa Book Of The Year Award last year.

Ms Mantel’s comments on the Duchess of Cambridge’s appearance comes shortly after she spoke about having body issues of her own.

Ms Mantel went from a size ten to a size 20 in nine months after she was diagnosed with severe endometrosis at the age of 27.

The treatment, which included surgery removing her womb leaving her infertile, caused her to gain four stone.

The 60-year-old author said she sometimes dreams of being thin again.

Prince 
William’s wife-to-be was as ‘painfully thin as anyone could wish, 
without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of 
character’.

She added: ‘Presumably Kate was designed to breed in some manners.

‘She looks like a nicely brought up young lady, with “please” and “thank you” part of her vocabulary.’

Mantel
 spoke of Kate’s appearance in her first official portrait since 
marrying William, painted by Paul Emsley, which was unveiled last month.

She said: ‘Her eyes are dead and she wears the strained smile of a woman who really wants to tell the painter to bugger off.’

Mantel went on to say that female Royals were ‘at the most basic... breeding stock, collections of organs.’

St James’s Palace last week criticized
 a magazine for printing pictures of Kate’s baby bump taken during a 
break on the Caribbean island of Mustique.

And
 they were furious last year when pictures of her topless on holiday 
were printed in Italy – saying ‘a red line had been crossed'.

But
 Mantel suggested Kate could have few complaints about private pictures
 of her being taken on holiday – observing: ‘The royal body exists to be
 looked at.’

‘Some people 
find them endearing; some pity them for their precarious situation; 
everybody stares at them, and however airy the enclosure they inhabit, 
it’s still a cage.’

Mantel gave the London Review of Books lecture ‘Undressing Anne Boleyn’ at the British Museum on the February 4. The full version of her speech is to be published in the latest edition of the London Review of Books, out on February 21.

Official bodies: Hilary Mantel said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge should not complain about invasion of privacy when pictures are taken of them on private holidays as a 'royal body exists to be looked at'

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, said Mantel’s comments were unfair.

She
 said that although Diana had at first seemed ‘bland’, later ‘we learned
 about all the troubles of her marriage and her personality began to 
shine through. Kate might yet come into her own.’

She added that Kate’s duties meant she ‘can’t do anything that might reveal (her) personality.

‘They
 have to be nice to everyone. They are probably stupefyingly bored but 
they can’t appear to be having anything other than a nice time.’

The
 Duchess chose yesterday to give an insight into the causes that she 
will support, hailing the start of a project which will see one of her 
charities receive a huge financial boost from a philanthropic 
organization.

Harsh: In her vicious attack on the Duchess, award winning author Hilary Mantel called her a 'doll to hang rags on'

Prize winners: Hilary Mantel's Bring Up The Bodies, which won the Man Booker Prize last year, and Wolf Hall, which scooped the award in 2009, are the first two parts of her Thomas Cromwell trilogy

She described 
her delight at Action On Addiction – which she backs as patron – 
becoming the beneficiary of the fundraising efforts of 100 Women in 
Hedge Funds during 2013.

- Hilary Mantel's first impression of Kate

‘Those
 affected by addiction are in desperate need of the highest level of 
care and treatment; Action On Addiction delivers this brilliantly,’ she 
wrote in a letter to mark the launch of the fundraising project.

‘Whether
 direct or indirect, the impact of addiction can be devastating.’

The Duchess, 31, will visit the addiction charity’s Hope House treatment
 centre, in Clapham, south London on Tuesday to meet women recovering from alcohol
 and drug dependency.

Mantel, 60, studied law at LSE and Sheffield University, before becoming a novelist.

She
 is author of more than a dozen books, including Wolf Hall and Bring Up
 The Bodies, the first two parts of a trilogy about King Henry VIII’s adviser Thomas Cromwell, both of which won the Man Booker Prize.
