Two men from Mexico face capital murder and other charges after an off-duty Border Patrol agent was fatally shot and his father wounded during a South Texas fishing trip.

Willacy County Sheriff Larry Spence says investigators believe the suspects tried to rob Agent Javier Vega Jr. of Kingsville and his family.

Hospital officials didn't immediately return a message Tuesday on the condition of Javier Vega Sr. of La Feria.

The Vegas were shot Sunday night while fishing near Santa Monica with relatives.

The suspects were captured in nearby Sebastian. Authorities have not confirmed their identities.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in a statement Tuesday said the younger Vega was a veteran of the Marine Corps and served the Border Patrol for six years.

He was also a married father of three.

Vega Jr. was able to return fire, which left the suspectâ€™s vehicle disabled a few miles away.

The men then walked to a small house and asked for water; a man in the area alerted police.

Spence said the robbery wasn't the first of its kind int he area.

'That's typical of some of these crimes that have been happening in the area,' Spence said.

'There are several instances where people have been robbed while fishing. They pulled up and try to rob them, take their money, jewelry and usually vehicle.'

Vega's sister -in-law Natalie Gardere Vega mourned the loss of the young man on Facebook.

'I will never understand why we have such heartless people in this world! An amazing man was taking (sic) from his family way to soon! Please keep my family in y'all's prayers! Especially his 3 boys and wife!

'And my father in law who is still in the hospital! We love you and will forever miss you Javier Vega Jr.!!!'
