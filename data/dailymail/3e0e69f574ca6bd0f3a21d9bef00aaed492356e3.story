This is the horrific moment a woman was pinned to the ground while writhing in pain as priests performed an exorcism. 

The 22-year-old woman, identified only by her first name Laura, was held down in a church in Buenos Aires, Argentina as Bishop Manuel Acuna, 52, ordered a demon to leave her body.

As she screamed 'no, no' and shouted abuse at one of the women holding her down, Bishop Acuna was heard muttering: 'Leave, leave her now.'

Bishop Manuel Acuna (pictured), 52, stood over Laura and ordered a demon to leave her body

Before the exorcism, locals gathered at the Lutheran Charismatic Church praying for her soul and redemption.

Bishop Acuna told them: 'The demon exists. He's not an idea, he's not a theory, he's not something abstract.

'The devil is a personality and therefore has a strategy. We are talking about something terrifying, a fallen angel. The devil is not a metaphor.

'The devil is something real that Jesus Christ faced. The devil looks for the perdition of the human being and for this he will use any possible evil instrument.'

Laura (pictured) screamed 'No, No' and shouted 'Whore' at one of the women holding her down

Intervention: Bishop Acuna was heard muttering 'leave, leave her now' as the woman was being pinned down

Locals said they could hear Laura 'screaming and crying' from inside a chamber at the church in Buenos Aires

Laura was then led into a chamber where church helpers held her to the ground.

Local man Augustus Amador Arevalo, 32, who had gone to pray for her said: 'We could hear her screaming and crying and we prayed for her deliverance.

'She was a good girl but turned bad when the devil possessed her. She had to be exorcised, she had to be free.'

The exorcism came to an end when she suddenly gave a strangled cry and closed her eyes, falling backwards exhausted. 

The exorcism reportedly took place at the Lutheran Charismatic Church in Buenos Aires, Argentina

Bishop Manuel Acuna (pictured) said Laura had encountered 'a group of demons similar to the ones that Jesus faced'

The exorcism came to an end when she suddenly gave a strangled cry and closed her eyes, falling backwards exhausted

She could be seen wiping away tears as the priest once again made the sign of the cross over her body.

Bishop Acuna said: 'Thank God, we've recovered a daughter of God. You haven't seen a major exorcism.

'This was a group of demons similar to the ones that Jesus faced. Her delivery is God's gift for us today.'
