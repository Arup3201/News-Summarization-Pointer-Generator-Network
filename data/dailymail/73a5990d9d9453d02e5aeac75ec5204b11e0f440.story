A video that shows a fat naked man pouncing on a bearded man during a television interview has been revealed to be a publicity stunt.

It was claimed that a son of gay-hate church leader Fred Phelps has been attacked live on TV by an obese naked man who sat on him and shouted 'who's your daddy now?'

Supposed Westboro Baptist Church member David Phelps was being interviewed in a mobile studio when a 35-stone man, who was wearing no clothes, suddenly burst out of a loo to confront him.

An actor posing as the son of Fred who does not exist was angrily commenting on a forthcoming live crucifixion, which U.S.-based TV station Battlecam intends to broadcast on Easter Sunday.

But the interview quickly descended into chaos when the naked man, who is understood to call himself Billy The Fridge, burst  in on proceedings.

A video of the incident was posted on YouTube and promptly went viral.

An eye-witness later claimed that he saw the bearded man being pursued down the street outside the mobile studio by a naked fat man.

The Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church has previously caused controversy in the U.S. by preaching anti-gay messages.

The video is a publicity stunt for Battlecam, planning to stream live footage across the internet of a man being publically crucified in Beverly Hills on Easter Sunday.

Founder: Fred Phelps established the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka in 1955. A placard in the background demonstrates the group's attitudes

Robert Garrison, described as 'a 
30-year-old sado-masochist from Florida', will be hammered onto a giant 
wooden cross behind a glass window in view of passersby at Battlecam 
TV's headquarters in Los Angeles.

The
 event is billed as 'honouring the sacrifices made by our Lord, Jesus 
Christ' - but it as been dismissed as inappropriate by some internet 
users in The States.

During 
the crucifixion a gospel choir will be sing Easter songs and chant Psalm
 22 which starts with the immortal words 'My God, my God, why hast thou 
forsaken me?'

Mr Garrison 
will be left impaled by 12in nails for several hours while users of 
Battlecam TV's social networking website are invited to comment.

When asked if he was worried whether the event would be criticised as being sacrilegious, Battlecam boss Alki David said: 'This is not disrespectful. We are bringing awareness of religion to online social networking.'

But one web user in The States commented: 'I just think there's better ways to honour him than to crucify someone.

'To me the best way to honour him is to help the kinds of people he did back when he was alive; like the poor, the sick and the starving for example.'
