Developers have discovered a secret chapel in the ruins of a Scottish castle - and they plan to turn it into a toilet for the rich and famous.

The hidden chamber was discovered during preparatory work at Mingary Castle, which is being rebuilt at a cost of more than £2.3m after lying empty for 150 years.

The 13th 
century castle is expected to become a luxury holiday retreat and the 
chapel will be converted into bathrooms, one with a toilet built into an
 alcove.

Secret chamber: The chapel was discovered by developers in the 10ft thick north wall

The chapel was discovered in the 10ft thick north wall. Its windows had been blocked up and part of the room filled in.

New plans for the property near Kilchoan, on the most westerly point of the British mainland, show the chamber divided into two bathrooms, one of which has the ‘throne room’ set into a window alcove.

Excitement: The chapel's windows had been blocked up and part of the room filled in

Historian Jon Haylett, from Kilchoan, 
who was present when the chapel was first discovered, said: 'The north 
wall is about three metres thick, it had windows showing from the outside 
but there was nothing but a wall on the inside, we knew there had to be 
something in there.

'It was quite a job to get into but when the chamber was opened up it was just about magic.

'Even the builders, who I wouldn't describe as men with particularly romantic feelings, were quite emotional.

'Excitement would be absolute understatement to how we were feeling.'

Heritage: The castle is protected as a category A listed building

Remote: The castle is located a mile from the village of Kilchoan in Lochaber, Scotland

Secret 
passages and a small room that were sealed up around 500 years ago have 
also been discovered during recent restoration work at the castle on the
 Ardnamurchan peninsula.

It is believed some of the rooms and passageways at the castle were filled in to make the walls more robust following the invention of cannons.

A £2.36m 
scheme to turn Scotland's best-preserved 13th Century castle into a 
luxury holiday home was recently approved by planners.

Jon added: 'The first surveys were done in 2011, that was when they learned that the castle needed urgent restoration.

Due to the castle’s remote location - a 
mile from the village of Kilchoan in Lochaber, Scotland - it has not 
been touched since it fell into ruin and was abandoned more than 200 
years ago.

The 13th century castle is roughly hexagonal in shape with 9ft-thick walls.

Its remains are protected as a category A listed building.

Mingary's
 position on the seafront meant it held key naval and military 
significance and King James IV was said to have used it as a stronghold 
for fighting off Clan Donald in the late 15th century.

The
 castle is owned by Donald Houston, of the Ardnamurchan Estate, who has 
asked archaeologists to restore the structure to its former glory at a 
cost of £2million.

'Now they've stopped taking things down and they're beginning to build it up again.

'They are starting to look at things like putting in floor joists and lintels and they are working on the chapel.'

Mingary Castle - which was once vital to a number of clan chiefs - is badly in need of repair, with the castle's shore walls starting to erode.

It is believed that the Lochaber castle has not been inhabited or renovated for over 150 years.

The structure is roughly hexagonal in shape
 with 9ft-thick walls and it is protected as a 
category A listed building.

Its position on the seafront meant it 
held key naval and military significance and King James IV was said to 
have used it as a stronghold for fighting off Clan Donald in the late 
15th century.

The huge renovation task is well underway and includes what is described as the biggest scaffolding job in Scotland.

Donald Houston, owner of Ardnamurchan Estate which includes the castle, won permission from Highland Council for a reinstatement to residential property, including change of use 'from ruin' to a home, which would be let out.

A recent survey showed that, unless urgent restoration work was carried out, the castle was in danger of collapse.

The castle restoration - undertaken by the Mingary Castle Preservation and Restoration Trust - has been boosted by the backing of Historic Scotland, in addition to already having charitable status.

The scheme has also won scheduled ancient monument consent and it will take another year to complete. So far it has received donations of just over £250,000 towards its restoration bill.

A hidden 6ft sq chamber has been also uncovered during the restoration work - it was sealed up during the 16th century and historians admit they don't know what the room was used for

The excavation on parts of the castle has already unearthed a cannonball believed to have been fired more than 350 years ago - discovered embedded in the walls - ammunition, pieces of leather and a medieval bucket in the castle's moat.

A tiny chamber measuring 6ft high and 6ft across was also uncovered during the restoration work.

Historians have admitted they don't know what the room was used for, and all that has been found inside are a few fragments of bone.

The room was discovered when builders found a passageway in the north wall of the building and began excavating it.

The trust is trying to raise enough cash to fund the £2.3million venture and has so far raised just over £250,000. To donate to the project, visit www.mingarycastletrust.co.uk
