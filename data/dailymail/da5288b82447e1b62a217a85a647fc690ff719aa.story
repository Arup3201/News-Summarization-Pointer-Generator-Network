A volunteer fire service worker has been sacked for tarnishing the fire service's reputation by posing for provocative photographs in her uniform.

Known on a website as 'Fireman Clare Louise', part-time model Clare Deloughrey, 26, is seen coming home after a day's firefighting.

The volunteer at Whitefield Fire Station, Manchester, strips out of her uniform, right down to her underwear, then poses naked while having a bubble bath.

However, Miss Deloughrey, who 
distributes advice and fits smoke alarms, fell foul of bosses and she 
was sacked for potentially harming the service's 'brand'.

The mother-of-one, from Prestwich, Greater Manchester, accused fire chiefs of 'overreacting' and being sexist, claiming male firefighters who had posed for 
raunchy pictures had not been sacked.

She said: 'I think they were very unprofessional in the way they acted.

'They could simply have asked me about this and I would have taken the pictures down no question.

'Instead they chose to sack me without any notice or warnings.'

Ms Deloughrey also works as a self-employed function planner.

A fire service spokesman said: 'What staff do in their private lives is a matter for them.

'However when they do so using our brand they are representing our organisation.

'It would not matter if they are male of female, paid or unpaid, we would not want our brand used in any commercial venture without our permission.'

Her dismissal follows the sacking of fellow volunteer Danny Harper, 22, who stole a brigade car and took it to Tatton Park where he carried out a bogus inspection in a historic hall.

Union bosses urged brigade chiefs to review the volunteer recruitment policy in light of his case and repeated calls for volunteers to wear different uniforms to regular fire fighters.

There are more than 400 volunteers currently serving with GMFRS.

A spokesman for the Fire Brigade's Union said: 'Again this reinforces the need for a review into clothing given to volunteers. It needs to be different from operational firefighters. You have people pretending to be something they are not and that is dangerous.'

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service chiefs said they were forced to sack Ms Deloughrey from her position as a volunteer at Whitefield fire station, pictured, because some of the images showed their logo

Fire chiefs were 'forced to take action' as the 
photos contained their logo and their 'brand' cannot be used without permission
