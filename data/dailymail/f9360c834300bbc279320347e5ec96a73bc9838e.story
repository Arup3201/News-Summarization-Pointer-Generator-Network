The owner of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier that ripped the head off another dog has been jailed.

David Savage, 45, was sentenced to four weeks in prison after he was spotted walking a different dog - in breach of a 10-year ban.

He was given a suspended sentence in August after his Staffordshire Bull Terrier George decapitated tiny Pomeranian Elvis in what was described as a ‘horrific’ attack in Warrington, Cheshire.

Savage was arrested by officers on Sunday walking another dog - described as larger than his previous one - and jailed for four weeks at Halton Magistrates Court on Monday for breaching his suspended sentence.

Mauling: Susan Campbell is seen dragging the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, called George, away after it had mauled Gemma Antell's Pomeranian dog Elvis in Warrington, Cheshire

Last year he admitted being in charge of dog dangerously out of control in a public place, and the court heard he had a conviction for the same offence in 2006.

Susan Campbell, who was walking the dog, called George, at the time, received a five-year banning order. The dog was destroyed.

The owners of the savaged pup Elvis said they were disgusted to hear Savage had been spotted walking another dog.

They were also furious that the animal has been allowed to remain at the house where Campbell and Savage live because they have claimed a third person owns it.

Mother-of-three Gemma Antell said: 'For an even bigger dog to be allowed to stay in that environment is like a timebomb.

'We’re pleased the court has taken this seriously but our main priority is that dog is still in that house because of a ridiculous loophole.

'It’s not fair on the dog and it should be removed and given to a loving home. If it’s brought up in the same environment then the same thing will happen again but next time it could be a child.'

The family were tipped off by friends in the Latchford area Savage had been seen with another dog and immediately contacted the police.

Mrs Antell, who has since replaced Elvis with a cross Pomeranian and chihuahua called Presley, added: 'I’m so scared of walking the dog now and feel nervous all the time.

'I really don’t want to see another victim of a dog attack and if they’re spotted again walking a dog we’re just going to keep ringing the police until they get the message.

Adorable: Elvis as was described as 'friendly, attention seeking and harmless'

'I feel like people and pets aren’t safe because they are not responsible for a dog and I’ve experienced the worst possible outcome.'

A picture of the dog that died, a Pomeranian pup called Elvis, covered in blood went viral after the incident in August last year.

At the time Elvis was playing in a garden in Latchford, Warrington, when he barked at another dog walking past.

George burst through the gate, snatching Elvis in its jaws and ripping his head off.

Witnesses say the dog then spat out Elvis’ head after being pulled away by its owner.

Mrs Antell, 30, described Elvis as ‘friendly, attention seeking and harmless’.

He was being looked after by mother-in-law Margaret Antell on Saturday while Gemma celebrated son Lincoln’s sixth birthday.

She added: 'It was like something out of a horror film, like it’s not actually happened. My children are distraught.

'It is the first thing they have had to lose and it’s completely changed the way they see dogs as they are now terrified, which is very sad.

'Elvis would never hurt anyone. The kids have grown up around him and he hardly had any teeth because with his breed, they fall out.

'Everyone loved him and we couldn’t walk down the street because people would want to stop and stroke him.

'I am still in shock. At least it wasn’t a child, but he was our loved family pet.'
