An Ohio woman has been arrested for inventing her four-year-old son's cancer diagnosis and convincing the boy and others that he was dying, to scam donations, gifts and attention from good Samaritans.

Authorities say Emily Creno-King, 31, pretended to friends, family, and strangers alike that her son JJ was dying of cancer, and shaved his head and made him wear a surgical mask to perpetuate the lie.

Creno-King, of Utica, is charged with felony child endangerment and could face additional charges when her case is submitted before a grand jury.

The mother-of-two began soliciting donations, ostensibly to help her manage with the costs of her son's illness, in December 2012.

Numerous Facebook groups, including Champions for the Creno Family, were set up to update followers on the child's condition and encourage donations for the single mother.

The page contains a lengthy description of King's trials and her selflessness.

In 2012, says the third-person description, she left her husband to 'save the lives of her and her children.'

'Emily has been so brave, courageous, and a true fighter during her struggle. She has a drive that only a mother fighting for her children can have, and it shows through every moment of every day... Through it all, Emily has not once asked for material or monetary donations, only prayers,' it reads.

Detective Damian Smith told NBC4 that many concerned people became involved with Creno-King following the revelations her son's lung tumors.

Smith said that when people who had suffered similar traumas began to ask her questions she couldn't answer, she would remove them from the Facebook group.

The father of Creno-King's children John Creno says he wasn't sure about his son's illness - evidence of which he'd never witnessed - but that his estranged wife managed to pull the wool over his eyes too.

'There was always a doubt in my mind,' Creno told NBC4. 'But once all the medicines started coming with him on weekends, I thought, "Ok, he really does have it."'

The medications Creno is referring to were given to the four-year-old to treat the seizures Creno-King alleged he was having.

The ruse was discovered when a mother whose child really is suffering from cancer made contact with Creno-King.

During subsequent correspondence, she became suspicious that Creno-King was lying about her son's illness and contacted the authorities.

Utica detectives received confirmation from several doctors at Nationwide Children's Hospital that Creno-King's claims were fraudulent.

The Newark Advocate reports that 
Creno-King repeatedly brought her son to the the Nationwide Children's 
Hospital claiming he was suffering seizures and breathing difficulty.

Court
papers state: 'Each time [the child] was brought into the hospital, 
staff was unable to find any signs or symptoms of medical distress.'

According to the hospital, Creno-King's son is the victim of medical child abuse by his mother - not cancer.

'[JJ] always begs me to tell the doctor to please take [the medication] away; and now I can finally tell him the doctor's going to be taking it away. He's out running and playing. He doesn't have to have a mask on anymore and he's thrilled about that because he hated the mask,' Creno told NBC4

The Newark Advocate reports that Creno didn't comment in court Wednesday as her bond was set at $50,000. Court records listed no attorney for her.

She was also forbidden from having unsupervised contact with her son during the hearing.

According to NBC4, Creno-King is undergoing a mental health evaluation at a Dublin treatment center. It is unknown whether this is a case of MÃ¼nchausen Syndrome by proxy, a well-documented disorder in which parents make their children ill for attention.

The prosecutor wouldn't discuss the possibility of more charges. Authorities say the alleged hoax began late last year.

Another Facebook page was set up for Creno-King's children following the revelations. According to that page, the two children are currently in the care of their paternal grandfather.
