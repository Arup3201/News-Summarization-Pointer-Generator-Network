It looks like a real-life game of Whack-a-Mole.

But instead of trying to hit the inquisitive  squirrel on the head with an inflatable mallet, Stacey Wallace, 28, took a 'selfie' with the animal.

The rodent popped out of its hole in search of nuts at Lightning Lake in British Columbia's Manning Park.

And to ensure she captured the perfect picture, Ms Wallace from Vancouver lay out on the ground metres away from the squirrel and slowly crawled towards him.

The ground squirrel stayed in position long enough for her to take a few pictures and later climbed into her arms for a cuddle.

'In order to get the selfie I laid on the ground metres away from the squirrel and slowly crawled towards him until I got close enough so I could take a picture,' said Ms Wallace. 

Ground squirrels generally burrow into the soil and live in holes rather than trees.

The term is most often used to describe medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots or prairie dogs.

Smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks. 

Together, they make up the 'marmot tribe' of squirrels, also known as the Marmotin.

They are variable in size, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand comfortably for prolonged periods.

Columbian ground squirrels live in colonies and females usually stay with the group they were born into, whereas males will leave their birth colony.

They hibernate seven or eight months out of the year and create a special hibernation chamber in its burrow that is sealed off from the rest of the burrow with a plug of dirt.
