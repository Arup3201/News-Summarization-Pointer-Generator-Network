Jose Mourinho wants NFL-style timeouts to be introduced to football so that he can discuss tactics with his players twice during each game.

The Chelsea boss believes managers would benefit from two brief stoppages - one in each half - to give specific instructions to their team and change formations.

Speaking after his side's 2-0 win against Leicester, Mourinho told The Telegraph: 'Football is very slow to change the rules.

'How many years have we had to wait for goalline technology?Â 

'I hope I am still in football when they give the coach the chance to stop the game during the first half once and during the second half because you can make the game much better.'

The Blues were drawing 0-0 with Nigel Pearson's side at half-time before goals after the break from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard sealed their second consecutive Premier League victory.

But Mourinho admitted that he wanted to speak with John Terry and Co just 10 minutes into the second period in order to rectify his side's substandard performance.

He added: 'It would be interesting. Louis van Gaal in the World Cup, the referee stopped the game for the water break and he changed the system of his team and managed to win the game.'
