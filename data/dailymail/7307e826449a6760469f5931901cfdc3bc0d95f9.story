Southampton have completed the loan signing of Benfica midfielder Filip Djuricic for the rest of the season.

It had previously been a quiet transfer window on the south coast with Eljero Elia the only arrival at the top-four contenders.

The 23-year-old Serbian international Djuricic had been on loan at German side Mainz.

'I know the player from Holland,' Ronald Koeman told the club's official YouTube channel.

'He played several seasons for Heerenveen and then he moved to Benfica.

'It's a young player, he's 23 years old, he's technical, fast and he can play in different positions in the midfield. He can play on the left side and the right side.

'It's part of the philosophy of the club; young players. He was in a difficult situation, he was on loan at Mainz and we will take him on loan for the rest of the season.

'It's a good possibility for him, and for us it's one more player who can play in different positions. It's always best for the coach to have more possibilities in players who can change positions.

'The last few weeks we have had problems to score goals, like Sunday.

'We created good opportunities and you have to score, always it's easy to have really good competition.'

Having lost Jack Cork to Swansea during this transfer window, the Saints are eager to bolster their midfield options. 

His compatriot, Southampton winger Dusan Tadic said: 'Filip is a really good player and a really good guy - we play in national team together. 

'He's having a difficult time in Mainz, but he's a good age and a good player with quality. I think he would be good here.'

Saints manager Koeman said he had been tracking Djuricic since his days at Dutch club Heerenveen.

'I know the player from Holland,' Koeman told Southampton's YouTube channel. 'He played several seasons for Heerenveen and then he moved to Benfica.

'He had some good games, there was a lot of interest in the player when he was at Heerenveen. He moved to Portugal and now it's a good chance for the player to develop himself.' 

He added: 'It's difficult for young players to make the step to teams like Benfica, it's physical football in Portugal and the player is more technical.

'I think it's better for him to play in a team like Southampton because our type of football is the best for Djuricic.'
