The world-famous, 1,000-mile journey across Alaska kicked off on Monday in Fairbanks. 

It usually starts 225 miles south in Willow, but poor conditions this year led organizers to reroute the trail around a mountain range.

Aaron Burmeister reclaimed the lead of the Iditarod on Saturday after leaving the checkpoint at Nulato ahead of Jeff King.

Burmeister hasn't taken his mandatory eight hour layover yet in the rice. King has.

The musher's kennel and breeding program has spent 17 years building an Iditarod team. The 39-year-old is the son of Iditarod veteran Richard Burmeister.

King, 59, is a four-time Iditarod winner. He has been mushing since 1976 after he heard Jerry Riley's race finish while listening to the radio.

Aliy Zirkle has also checked in at Nulato, a village of 246 people who rely on a trapping and subsistence lifestyle.

Zirkle is trying for her first win after finishing second in the last three years. If the 45-year-old pulls in to the finish line at Nome first, she would be the first female Iditarod winner since 1990 when the late Susan Butcher finished first.
