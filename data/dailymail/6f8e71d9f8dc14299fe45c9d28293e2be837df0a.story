Loyalty cards may be just a cunning way for companies to track consumer trends, but one has come up with a scheme that aims ultimately to benefit people in far greater need than CEOs, MDs and shareholders.

Nectar has teamed up with Oxfam, launching the first ever loyalty point scheme to reward those who donate to charity.

TV presenter Laura Whitmore helped launch Tag Your Bag, a pioneering project which will see customers collect points for items they donate which are then sold in store.

The groundbreaking initiative aims to get more people to donate more clothes more regularly, in effort to raise millions of pounds for Oxfam's work fighting poverty around the world.

From Thursday, customers who sign up for it will earn two Nectar points for every £1 their donated items raise when sold in Oxfam shops.

They will also get 100 Nectar points for signing up to the Tag Your Bag scheme in the first place.

MTV presenter Laura Whitmore, 27, kicked it off by donating a number of dresses, including a 60s-style lemon mini-dress.

Whitmore will be auctioning her yellow, sixties-style dress on the Oxfam eBay channel on Thursday

The dress itself will be available for the public to bid on via the Oxfam eBay site, on Thursday from 10am on 4 April www.ebay.co.uk/oxfam.

Donating her old clothes at the Oxfam shop in Hampstead, north London, Whitmore, who is originally from Ireland, said: 'I think this is a great new idea and I'll definitely be clearing out my house more frequently from now on.

'Oxfam relies on good donations, and with the launch of Tag Your Bag, not only are we doing our bit to help, we also get a little something back from Nectar.

'I'd like to encourage everyone to delve deep into their cupboards to find quality items they no longer need or want and donate these through Tag Your Bag to help Oxfam continue its crucial work.'

Sarah Farquhar, Head of Retail Brand at Oxfam, said: 'We're so pleased to announce this exciting partnership with Nectar.

'Oxfam is always looking for good, quality donations and this initiative will help us engage with an entirely new audience.

'Collecting Nectar points in this way is exclusive to Oxfam and we are aiming to raise millions of pounds from the scheme, going a long way in supporting our vital work fighting poverty around the world.'

Customers who sign up to the scheme will receive a welcome pack, including 
all-important tags which must be attached to the bag of donated goods 
when dropped at an Oxfam shop.

All quality donations are welcomed as part of this initiative including books, music, clothing and homewares.

Oxfam will process all donations, adding a unique code to each item to ensure sales can be tracked back to the individual donor.

This allows points to be rewarded if and when an item is sold in the store or through Oxfam's online shop.

James
Frost, Nectar Marketing Director, added: 'We're delighted to announce 
this exciting new phase in our partnership with Oxfam.

'We hope it will help increase much needed donations to the charity.

'We
are always looking at new ways for our card holders to earn points and 
Tag Your Bag provides a unique and charitable way to do just that.'

Customers can sign up to Tag Your Bag in any Oxfam shop or online, by visiting www.oxfam.org.uk/tagyourbag
