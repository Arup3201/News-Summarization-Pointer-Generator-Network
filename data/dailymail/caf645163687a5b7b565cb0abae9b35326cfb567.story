Jealous boyfriend: Ashley Surfleet, 20, attacked his girlfriend while high on mephedrone after accusing her of cheating on him

A jealous boyfriend who battered his girlfriend with a pair of nunchucks before burning her face with a flame-thrower while high on drugs has been jailed.

Ashley Surfleet, 20, subjected his partner Josina Clarke, 24, to the terrifying ordeal after accusing her cheating on him with a man she met on Facebook. 

A court heard how Surfleet had taken the illegal drug M-Cat before the attack which left Miss Clarke with a
broken arm, two black eyes, swelling to her nose, cuts to her head, 
bruising and scratches to arms and legs and a blister on her cheek.

Surfleet was sentenced to 
three-and-a-half years in a young offenders' institution after pleading 
guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent and common assault last week.

A court heard how Surfleet launched the attack at his mother's home in Market Rasen, Lincs., punching Miss Clarke in the face and hitting her in the head with the deadly Kung-Fu weapon. 

Miss Clarke managed to escape out of a window and hid in bushes outside on September 22 last year.

But Surfleet, of Osgodby, Lincs., found her cowering in the garden and dragged her back to the house by her hair where he punched her again.

Miss Clarke fled to the bathroom where Surfleet followed with a lighter and an aerosol can, which he used as a makeshift flame-thrower to burn her face and head.

She managed to escape by jumping 15ft from the bathroom window before running across a field to a nearby house where she raised the alarm.

Jailing Surfleet at Lincoln Crown Court,
Judge Michael Heath told him: 'You professed to love her but you 
treated her in a way that was completely contrary of any expression of 
love.

'This was a serious incident of domestic violence.'

The court heard Surfleet attacked his girlfriend after taking banned party drug M-Cat - also known as Meow Meow and mephedrone.

Prosecutor Esther Harrison said: 'He punched her to the face. He pushed and shoved her around.

Weapon: Nunchucks are a traditional Japanese weapon consisting of two sticks connected at one end with a short chain or rope (stock image)

'He then got some nunchucks from the bedroom and hit her repeatedly with them.

'She was screaming and in pain.

'She climbed out of a window and hid in some bushes.

'Surfleet followed Miss Clarke and dragged her back into the house by the hair.

'Surfleet punched her and
then created a flame thrower after lighting the spray from an aerosol 
can which he used to burn her face.

'Miss Clarke eventually managed to escape through a window and fled to a nearby house for help.

'Despite her ordeal, Miss Clarke still has feelings for Surfleet and wants him to get help for his behaviour.'

When police interviewed Surfleet he said he could not remember what had happened and that he loved his girlfriend.

Defending, Michael Cranmer-Brown said: 'He wasn't thinking straight or behaving in his normal way.

'His life had gone completely off the rails.'
