Sapper: Mark Antony Smith, 26, of Swanley, Kent, died in Sangin, Helmand province, in July 2010

Failures by the Armed Forces to check for ageing shells dating back to the Cold War could be putting their own troops' lives at risk from 'friendly fire', a coroner warned today.

Sapper Mark Antony Smith, 26, was killed instantly by a stray coalition smoke shell up to 30 years old as he rested in a compound in the Sangin area of Helmand in July 2010.

The serviceman,  from Swanley, Kent, who was with the Army's Counter Improvised Explosive Device Task Force searching for buried bombs, was hit when the 105mm munition fell 866ft short of its intended target.

The inquest into his death heard that the age of the shell and its propellant had not been tested to check if they had deteriorated.

This could have been one explanation why the munition fell short of its intended target.

Experts told the inquest that crucial weather data affecting the speed and direction of the shell had not been inputted correctly into a malfunctioning missile launch system.

The Ministry of Defence insisted the missile was no more than three years old.

But Coroner Roger Hatch said the truth of the tragedy might never be known because of the Army's 'flawed' investigation. He condemned the Army's probe as 'unsatisfactory' due to missing evidence and incomplete documentation.

'I take the view that there should be a statutory inquiry into the systemic failures,' he said.

'There has been a systematic failure in the collection of that evidence that leaves questions unanswered and potentially dangers remain for soldiers who use the ammunition that has not been tested.

'Because of the age of the rounds, it is possible their condition may require verification to discuss whether the propellant may have contributed to the shell falling short.

'It is now quite clear that this was never done. What is clear from all the evidence I have heard is that we are left without knowing why there was a short fall of the fatal shell.'

He pledged to report the matter to the Ministry of Defence. He concluded that Spr Smith died of catastrophic injuries 'in the course of active service when a smoke shell fell short'.

There were a 'number of possibilities or
 combination of factors' that the missile, designed to provide cover for
 soldiers working on the ground, went 'rogue'.

Soldier: Spr Smith, from 36 Engineer Regiment, was taking part in an action against the Taliban in an area described as 'highly dangerous'

Spr Smith, from 36 Engineer Regiment, 
was taking part in an action against the Taliban in an area described as
 'highly dangerous due to insurgent activity'.

A smoke screen was requested to allow the troops to advance towards enemy positions.

In the morning one shell fell 1,476ft from its target, hitting an empty compound.

Later that afternoon, a second shell intended to allow soldiers to fell some trees hit another compound where Spr Smith was resting. Two other servicemen were injured.

Speaking at the end of the four-day inquest in Gravesend, Kent, today, Spr Smith's devastated mother Helen said: 'We believe that Mark’s death was preventable.

'The evidence shows that a broken weather computer and use of incorrect data from earlier in the day resulted in Mark’s death.

'This is compounded by the fact that the investigation was flawed.Key evidence has gone missing and has never been returned to the UK.

'We will probably never know if the ammunition failed on that fateful day. We believe the Ministry of Defence needs to take responsibility for this so as to avoid further deaths.”

An Army spokesman said: 'This was a tragic accident, which resulted in the death of a gifted and well-respected soldier.

'Lessons have been learnt, including ensuring that a minimum safety buffer zone of 500 metres is established before firing smoke rounds.'
