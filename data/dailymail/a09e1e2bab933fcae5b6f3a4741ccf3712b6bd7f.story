Cellulite affects everyone from the super slim 
to the ultra curvy and from detox diets to miracle creams, there are no shortage of gimmicks out there to help banish the dreaded
lumps and bumps.

And now, one company has taken the battle against unsightly orange-peel skin one step further with its gold-infused leggings.

Proskins - an anti-cellulite compression wear and slimming legging company - has today unveiled the 24-carat gold legwear that promise to banish cellulite.

Can these gold leggings banish cellulite? Proskins has unveiled 
24-carat gold leggings which promise to improve the appearance of your legs in as little as three days

So how do they work? The black leggings are packed with tiny gold particles which are full of thousands of hyaluronic acid molecules.

Hyaluronic acid is a powerful moisturiser that occurs naturally in the skin. As we age, the natural hyaluronic acid in the skin decreases, leaving it looking tired, dull and dry.

Proskins Gold claim the hyaluronic acid in the leggings penetrates deeply into the skin to hydrate and moisturise and leave it with a fresh, youthful appearance.

Proskins say it's the first time ever that these ingredients have been used in leggings, as well as in gloves and eye masks, which the company also offer.

They claim that their gold garments can provide intense hydration for legs, tackle crows’ feet around the eyes and smooth hands in just three days.

Beat the bumps: The leggings also promise to help to contour and improve the appearance of problem areas and the moisturising and antioxidant benefits continue for up to two days after wear

The leggings also promise to help contour and improve the appearance of problem areas for up to two days after wear.  

The brand says unique yarn technology means the micro-capsules are guaranteed to remain in the garment for at least 100 washes.

Model Sophie Anderton is a fan and has even said that she would rather wear the mask, gloves and leggings to bed than a sexy negligee.

She said: 'Now that I am 36, having youthful looking legs is certainly a lot harder than when I started out modelling nearly 20 years ago - no matter how many trips you make to the gym.

'But in less than three days of wearing them, I noticed that my legs were far more hydrated and super smooth.

They definitely had a "youthful glow" and the effects didn’t stop after I stopped wearing them, which is a big bonus.'

The leggings cost £145 and the eye mask and gloves are £45 each. All three are on sale at the Harrods pharmacy.
