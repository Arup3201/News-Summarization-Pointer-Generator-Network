England batsman James Taylor is using Kevin Pietersen's criticism of him as motivation to win a place in the World Cup squad and dismissed him as 'one of those little people who doubts me'.

Taylor made his Test debut in the series against South Africa in 2012 but has struggled for an England spot since, making just a single one-day appearance against Ireland in 2013.

In his autobiography released last month, Pietersen wrote how he told then-coach Andy Flower that Taylor was too short for international cricket and how he 'didn't think he was up to it'.

The 5ft 6in right-hander has earned a recall for England's upcoming one-day series in Sri Lanka and admits he will be using Pietersen's comments to drive him on.

'I took it nicely,' Taylor said with a smile on his face.

'Everybody is allowed their opinion and I've had plenty of people in the past saying things about me behind my back, that's just the way it is.

'We're all big enough and strong enough to take it - it motivates you.

'There are plenty of people who have doubted me in the past and he's just another one of those little people who doubts me.

'I've proven them wrong and I'll continue to do that - it spurs you on, proving people wrong is a big motivation for me.'

Taylor, who is currently doing Movember, added: 'There's no anger. So many people doubt you all the time - especially with me being smaller than most.

'That doesn't bother me though - I pack a decent punch for my size.

'I've also scored runs in the past and hopefully I'll do that in the future in international cricket.'

Taylor enjoyed an impressive domestic campaign for Nottinghamshire and scored four centuries in his last eight games for the club.

England have been criticised for being tactically rigid in the one-day game but Taylor believes he can add some versatility to the side's batting line-up.

'I think that's my biggest strength - adapting to any given situation put in front of me,' Taylor said.

'I scored a few hundreds at the end of the season and every one was in a different situation.

'The tempo was different each time and I think we won every game bar one.

'So I'm winning games and that's what I want to do for England, win games and finish games and put in those match-winning performances.'

After their seven-match series in Sri Lanka, England will play four matches in a Triangular Series with Australia and India.

The programme allows Alastair Cook's side time to establish some rhythm before the World Cup starts in February and Taylor is determined to show what he can do.

'There are seven ODIs for me to impress and show what I can do on and off the field so fingers crossed my name is in that World Cup squad,' Taylor said.

'It's like a new start for us. If you look down the squad and look at the names - the talent and match-winners we have with bat and ball is outstanding.

'There's a great mix of youth and experience. It's nice to be a part of. It's a new challenge for English cricket and it's great for all the players involved.'
