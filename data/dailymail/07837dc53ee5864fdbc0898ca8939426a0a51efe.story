U.S. birth rates have been on a steady decline since the onset of the ‘Great recession.’

Newly released data shows births fell 10 per cent from 2008 to 2011, down to well under 4million births after hitting an all-time high of 4.3million births in 2007. A steep decline in teen pregnancies is also believed to be causing the fall.

‘In 2011, there were 3.8 million live births in hospitals, which was 436,000 less or a decrease of 10.3 percent compared to 2008,’ the Agency for Health Research and Quality said in a report.

Falling: Births dropped from an all-time high of 4.3million in 2007 to just 3.8million in 2011

Births have dropped 400,000 after hitting an all-time high of 4.3million in 2007, statistics show.One of the contributing factors is the drop in teen pregnancies.

Teen birth rates have been dropping steadily for the past 20 years, and hit a new historic low in 2011, the government said.

The rate hit only 31.3 births per 1,000, dropping from 34.2 the prior year and almost halving the 1991 peak of 61.8.

The teen birth rate has dropped 25 per cent since 2007 and 49 per cent since 1991.

MTV’s ’16 and Pregnant’ has been widely credited with helping to curb teen pregnancies.

A recent study found the controversial television show ‘led to a 5.7 percent reduction in teen births in the 18 months following its introduction.’

The show also ‘led to more searches and tweets regarding birth control and abortion’ among the teen set, the study found.

‘This accounts for around one-third of the overall decline in teen births in the United States during that period,’ the study concluded.

Birth rates have fallen one or two per cent across most demographics, but women over 35 have remained steady, according to the government.

This was attributed to more financial stability and the urgency to have a child while they are still able.
