Imagine a home where if you asked your thermostat to change temperature it would, or one that could text your neighbours if an alarm went off while you were on holiday.

These scenarios are all now a reality after Google-owned thermostat firm Nest opened up its software for developers to use for the first time.

It means that other companies will now be able to take advantage of the smart thermostat’s software - which can be controlled remotely.

Nest has opened up its software for third-party developers to use for the first time so that companies will now 
be able to take advantage of the smart thermostat's (pictured) software - which can be controlled remotely

Nest Labs was formed in 2011, but earlier this year was purchased by Google for $3.2 billion (£1.8 billion).

Co-founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rodgers had both previously worked at Apple, including on the iPod and original iPhone.

The company has two central products so far - a smart thermostat that can be controlled via a mobile device, and an alarm system that also monitors carbon monoxide levels.

The announcement confirmed the first partners have linked up with Nest to use Google voice recognition and the phrase ‘OK Google’ in order to verbally change temperature on the thermostat.

Rodgers, vice president of engineering at Nest, said: ‘The Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Protect alarm are already helping people save energy, stay comfortable and improve home safety - but that’s only the beginning.

The smart LiFx lights (pictured left) were funded by a Kickstarter campaign. They start at $89 
(£53) each and an individual light can be customised to be any colour on
 the spectrum using an app (right). When connected to the Nest alarm, the smart light bulbs can be used to warn of carbon monoxide leaks, for example

Qualcomm presented its vision for a connected home at Mobile World Congress in February, and showed how almost anything in the home can be controlled by a smartphone or linked together electronically.

From smartlocks and security lights to fridges, all the devices in its conceptual dwelling are sold by individual companies, but all of them run AllJoyn software.

AllJoyn is an open source project set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011.

It is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn.

The company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further.

For example, an August smartlock can be linked to lights that flash if they sense an intruder, using the system.

‘Our goal has always been to bring this kind of thoughtfulness to the rest of your home and life - and that’s what the Nest Developer Programme is all about.

‘To kick off the programme, we’ve worked with iconic brands like Mercedes-Benz and Whirlpool, as well as new industry leaders like Jawbone and LiFx, to build seamless, secure and practical ‘Works with Nest’ experiences for the home.’

The Mercedes-Benz set-up will enable a car to send a message when a driver begins their journey home so the thermostat can start heating or cooling accordingly, in time for their arrival.

The Jawbone activity monitor wristband communicates with Nest to set the temperature as a person wakes up and it can do this because the Jawbone UP24 wristband tracks a wearer's sleep.

‘We’re trying to invent experiences you’ll use everyday with products that you’ll use everyday’, said Rodgers.

‘We want to build an experience, not something just for the sake of it.’

Nest said that more than 5,000 developers have already registered an interest in working with the software, including light bulb manufacturer LiFx, which has developed a system to turn the internal lighting of your home red should the Nest carbon monoxide monitor detect a leak.

Phil Bosua, founder and chief executive of LiFx, said: ‘When we first heard about the Nest Developer Programme, we knew we wanted to be a part of it.

‘Nest brings a whole other dimension to LiFx. Who would have thought by combining Nest products and LiFx products, we could help save lives?’

The launch will further fuel talk of a movement towards the ‘internet of things’ - an ever-growing idea that soon all of the devices we use will be connected together, much like computers when using the web.

Technology giant Samsung has confirmed in the past that the company believes that this trend will be the key development of the next decade in the technology sector, with UK president Andy Griffiths saying he believes the future is all about the ‘connected home’.

Chipmaker Qualcomm has also unveiled a concept of the connected home where its AllJoyn software connects various smart devices from smartlocks and security lights to the fridge and TV.

AllJoyn works in a similar way to Works with Nest, by making it possible for smart gadgets from various manufacturers to 'talk' to each other, however, AllJoyn doesn't need a single product at its centre to function, like Nest does.
