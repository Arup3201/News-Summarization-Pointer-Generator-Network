Manchester City and Montenegro forward Stevan Jovetic claims Russia were waiting for an excuse before their Euro 2016 qualifier was abandoned amid chaotic scenes on Friday.

The Group G game in Podgorica was marred by trouble from the first minute when play was suspended for over half an hour after Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was struck by a flare thrown from the stands.

German referee Deniz Aytekin eventually abandoned the match after a missed second-half penalty by Russia's Roman Shirokov led to a mass brawl on the pitch while riot police struggled to contain supporters off it.

Jovetic hopes the violent scenes will not see Montenegro punished too harshly, while suggesting the Russians were searching for an excuse to lodge a complaint. 

'I have problems finding words after this incident,' he told reporters.

'I just hope the fine won't be too harsh.

'However, it seems like the Russians waited for the smallest thing to happen so they can tell the referee.'

Meanwhile, Montenegrin fans who keep causing trouble and forced Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Russia to be abandoned are 'barbarians', according to the general secretary of their FA.

'These fans sing "Montenegro we love you" but throw flares, insult rivals and cause all sorts of incidents every time they turn up and that's outright hypocrisy,' general secretary Momir Djurdjevac told reporters after the ugly scenes in the stadium.

'We have left the impression of barbarians and this is a complete disaster. It seems we don't deserve to have a nation, a soccer team or a berth in a major tournament.

'As far as I am concerned the game should not have continued after the first-minute incident. We can only thank God that no one was seriously hurt.'

Montenegro face Denmark next on June 8 and currently sit, level with Russia, with five points from four games.
