A retired British economist and his wife are thought to have been bludgeoned to death at their home in Tasmania.

Professor Gavin Mooney, 69, and Dr Delys Weston, 62, were found at the property in Tasmania on Wednesday.

Professor Mooney was previously the director of the Social and Public Health Economics Research Group in Australia and held a number of senior positions at universities in the country.

He was born in Glasgow in 1943 and graduated from the University of Edinburgh before embarking on a career that saw him hold academic positions in the UK, Denmark and Australia. He moved to Australia permanently in 1993.

Australian health minister Tanya Plibersek said the deaths were a 'tragic loss for the health community, both in Australia and internationally'.

She said: 'Professor Mooney was a fearless advocate for social justice, and in particular the role of citizen juries, leading debates on the importance of consumers in determining how their health resources are allocated.

'Described as 'one of the founding fathers of health economics', his research was driven by real world challenges and geared towards identifying practical solutions.

'He was an inspiring teacher and supervisor, which when coupled with his extensive publication record, will ensure his legacy persists.'

Australian media reports said Dr Weston's son had been arrested in connection with the deaths and is expected to appear in court in the new year.
