Casey Anthony’s own defence team had her trial halted temporarily so that psychologists could determine whether or not she was mentally fit for trial, it emerged today.

Trial goes on: Casey Anthony appeared in court today after a break in session on Saturday

In a bizarre turn of events, Judge Belvin Perry revealed at the start of proceedings in Orlando, Florida, today that Anthony, 25, had been examined by three state-appointed mental health experts over the weekend, after a motion filed by her lawyers brought proceedings to a sudden halt on Saturday.

The episode came amid bafflement by legal commentators over where the accused murderer’s defence case is going.

Five weeks into the trial her lead 
lawyer, Jose Baez, has still not backed claims made during his opening 
statement that Anthony’s behaviour following the death of her 
two-year-old daughter Caylee in June 2008 stemmed from deep-rooted 
psychological issues caused by her father sexually molesting her as a 
child.

In a separate 
development, another of Anthony’s lawyers was today reported to have 
filed a motion for a mistrial, attempting to have the death penalty 
taken off the table as their client fights to save herself from a 
first-degree murder conviction and possible execution.

Today jurors were handed pieces of rubbish to smell.

The debris, collected from Casey Anthony's car, was given to jurors to 'prove' that the foul smell prosecutors argued was a 'stench of death' was just rotting rubbish.

Prosecutor Jeff Ashton asked the judge for permission to let the jurors smell for themselves, handing them a box and other rubbish that had been found in Anthony's car.

Attorney
Ann Finnell, a death penalty expert, was said to have filed the motion 
based on a ruling made by a judge in Miami last week relating to a 1991 
murder case.

In that case,
the way in which the death penalty was applied was deemed 
unconstitutional, though it does not automatically apply to every other 
capital case.

Despite the 
manoeuvre, which was not immediately addressed in court, Anthony’s trial
continued this morning with evidence from the lead detective in the 
case, following an address by Judge Perry explaining Saturday’s delay.

'On Saturday the defence team filed a motion to determine competency to proceed,' the judge revealed.

'Based
on that motion, the court ordered the defendant to be examined by three
psychologists to determine her competency to proceed.'

Anthony - who on Saturday had appeared agitated with her lawyers, at one point gritting her teeth and snarling aggressively at defence team member Cheney Mason – sat calmly, reading legal documents and sometimes smiling, as she awaited the start of today’s court session.

Judge Perry said that based on the independent psychologists’ reports, 'the court will find that the defendant is competent to continue.'

The experts’ exact findings will remain secret. 'Those reports will be filed but pursuant to law those reports will remain under seal,' said the judge.

Anthony is accused of murdering her daughter by overpowering her with chloroform and then sealing her nose and mouth with duct tape, to free her up to 'live the good life', prosecutors allege. She has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, aggravated child abuse and providing false information to law enforcement.

She was arrested in July 2008 after her mother, Cindy Anthony, became suspicious of her stories as to Caylee’s whereabouts.

Anthony told her mother that the little girl was with a nanny but, when challenged further by her mother and law enforcement, claimed that Caylee had been kidnapped by the nanny.

The nanny later turned out to be non-existent - one of several 'imaginary friends' that Anthony dreamed up, Mr Baez has admitted to the court.

At the start of the trial last month, Anthony’s defence again changed as Mr Baez claimed that Caylee had actually drowned accidentally in the family’s pool on June 16, 2008, but that the child’s mother had covered it up out of fear.

WFTV legal analyst Bill Sheaffer explained that the attempt to have her declared incompetent for trial did not amount to an attempt at an insanity defence.

'Like so many things we have seen in this trial, that’s unusual what we have just seen happen….but there’s a difference between employing the insanity defence and issues of competency to proceed.

'An insanity defence must be put by the defence before you ever go to trial in a case – it means you were insane at the time of the commission of the defence and basically boils down to that you didn’t know the difference between right and wrong.

'Competency to proceed' says that at any time during proceedings either the court, the defence or the prosecution feels that this client is not able to participate in their defence in a meaningful way, that the court should conduct an inquiry into whether or not the client is competent to proceed.

'Obviously Mr Mason or others thought that Casey’s emotional state was such that she could not proceed to help the defence.'
