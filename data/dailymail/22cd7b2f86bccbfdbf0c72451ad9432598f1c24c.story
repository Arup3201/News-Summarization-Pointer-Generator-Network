We are more accustomed to seeing her dressed to the nines in figure-hugging dresses each morning but national treasure Holly Willoughby proves she can pull off the casual look with aplomb too.

Holly, 32, looks stunning as she poses in an array of cosy Christmas knits in her new Oral-B campaign.

Speaking about festive style, Holly said: 'Although I love to feel fabulous and look beautiful during this season, being comfortable is key.

Happy Holly-days! Holly Willoughby poses in some cosy knits for her new Oral-B Christmas campaign and says she opts for comfort over sparkly dresses in December

'Christmas
parties for me are less about a sparkly dress and heels and more about 
the most ridiculous Christmas jumper I can find.

'I want to be 
comfortable so I can eat canapés and drink mulled wine - I don’t want to 
be in sequins, I want to be comfy in knitwear.

'Saying this, when it comes to Christmas Day, I like to wear red. I
think you have to have one staple red dress in your wardrobe that you 
can put on and feel festive and fabulous.

'I have a pretty dress that I 
only wear on Christmas, and I always wear something with an elasticated 
waistband!'

Holly will be spending Christmas at her mother’s house, so she can sit, relax, and just eat, drink and be merry.

She
is, however, hosting a Boxing Day party at her house, so has shared her
tips for a stress-free Christmas, and also reveals how she manages to 
do it all and still look gorgeous during the holidays.

'The three main important beauty aspects for me during the festive party season are my lips, lashes and teeth.

'I smile a lot, especially at Christmas, so I like to have a nice natural white smile which is why I use Oral-B 3D White Luxe – it really looks after my teeth and helps keep them looking shiny, healthy and removes stains.

'I also think a red lip at Christmas is really nice - I love MAC RED. 

'Combine this with tonnes of Max Factor Clump Defy mascara and a slight shimmer - a wash of bronze across the eye can look lovely.'

Lady in red: Holly says she swears by crimson lips and a staple red dress over the festive period

Holly, who remains unflappable at all times on This Morning (even when dealing with the likes of Katie Hopkins), has shared her advice on staying calm over the Christmas period.

She said: 'You can take the stress out of Christmas by trying to be as organised as you possibly can.

'I try and get all my shopping done before December so all the presents are wrapped in my lounge and ready so I can really relax and enjoy Christmas.

'If I see things throughout the year that I think someone will like then I buy them then and there.

'Around October/November, I really start cranking it up with shopping; otherwise Christmas turns into a panic!

'I do a lot of shopping online as it’s so easy. I don’t always get much of a chance to browse around the shops, and I love the fact that you can click "gift wrap".'In bed with Holly: Miss Willoughby has also unveiled a range of vintage-inspired bedding for BHS

'This is originally Philip Schofield’s top tip, but…my top tip is to hire in all of the plates, glasses, pots and pans. 

'The moment something is used, it gets put in a box in the garden which then gets collected after Christmas. Isn’t it a brilliant idea? Particularly if you’ve got a big family!'.

Holly has been busy in the run up to Christmas and last week unveiled her new bedding range for BHS.

Face compact - RMK do a really beautiful one. It’s got a bit of foundation in it, but it’s more of a powder. It’s a nice, neat compact that’s great to have in your handbag. It helps give a matte complexion, and it also has a shiny strip you can use on your cheeks as a highlighter to give a slightly dewy finish.

Dental Floss - I have a bit of a thing for flossing, I always carry Oral-B Pro-Expert Premium floss with me and I love it. Once you get into it you get addicted!

Lip balm - I really like Sisley as they do a lovely lip balm in a little pink pot and that’s perfect. It’s brilliant in the winter for when you get dry lips.

Mascara - I get through tonnes of mascara. I’m not one of those girls who just puts on a tiny bit. I like to layer up mascara, so love a brilliant mascara like Max Factor Clump Defy.

Eyeliner – Lancôme do a really nice one with a felt tip end, it’s called Plume in noir. It’s really good and helps create a steady line for my ‘flick’.
