Police are offering a $5,000 reward for any information on a pipe bomb that was discovered in Marshfield, Massachusetts.

The bomb squad was alerted when a resident called 911 after spotting the device in the middle of the street around the Brant Rock area on Sunday afternoon.

Although no one was injured, the homemade pipe bomb was so sensitive that it exploded while the bomb squad was attempting to disarm it.

Officials believe that the device may have been attached to a vehicle, which was a possible target, but fell off in Marshfield, a town of about 25,000 around 30 miles southeast of Boston.

Phillip Tavares, police chief of Marshfield, told CBS Boston: 'It ended up here, but we don't believe that it was placed here, and that part is still under investigation at this time.'

Terry Molloy, who noticed the device outside her home, told Wicked Local Orleans that the bomb looked like a small black box with a battery attached to it.

'It looked like a broken gadget or something'.

Jennifer Mieth, public information officer for the state Department of Fire Services, said: 'State Police take this opportunity to remind people if they see a suspicious looking object that might be a bomb, to not touch it and call authorities for this very reason.

'Simply moving a bomb can set it off.'
