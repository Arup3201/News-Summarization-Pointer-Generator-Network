The owners of an Adelaide hotel who have been offering free accommodation for people affected by the devastating bushfires have been overwhelmed by the positive response from their good deed.

James and Natalie Robertson opened up the doors of The Hampshire Hotel in Adelaide on Sunday after putting a call out on Facebook saying they had spare rooms for emergency accommodation as the worst fires in 30 years continued to tear through the state. 

'To all those affected by the fires - if you have been, or need to be, evacuated from your home and have no where to stay, we have some rooms available FREE of charge for you to stay in if needed,' the post read.

The recently renovated hotel on Groste Street was inundated with requests for emergency accommodation and has since received numerous food donations and offers from volunteers willing to help.

The original Facebook post received more than 10,000 likes and was shared more than 3,000 times.

'We don't consider ourselves as heroes or amazing people. We are just people who have the means and a way of providing help to those that need it the most,' the couple said.

'We are no different from those that have done the same thing and opened up their homes and donated their possessions.

'In the eyes of the people whose lives have been shattered or who are experiencing frightening and unknown times then perhaps to them we are heroes - each and every one of us.'

The Robertsons say they opened their hotel to families in need of accommodation because they weren't able to be on the front line of the fires. 

'That's why we decided the next best thing we could offer is a bed for stranded people to sleep on and a roof over their head due to having their own so tragically taken away,' they said.

'When we first heard the devastation that the Adelaide fire had already caused, and had the potential to cause, it instantly reminded us of the times we have been in a similar position ourselves when we lived in country SA.'

Authorities are now preparing for potentially catastrophic weather conditions that could fan a blaze that has already ripped through almost 13,000 hectares and destroyed or badly damaged 38 homes in the Adelaide Hills. 

David Miller who lives in Kersbrook, north east of Adelaide, was among those to lose his home.

He watched on as fires roared up the valley behind his home, luckily managing to escape with his dog before it hit.

'There was nothing we could do about it. It just exploded all around us,' he told ABC's 7.30.

'It's part of life, you know, but everything can be rebuilt. 

'We'll be right, fellas. We'll just plod along. Have a beer at the end of each day and see what tomorrow brings. At least I wake up in the morning.'

Firefighters from Victoria and NSW are set to reinforce 700 South Australian counterparts already battling the bushfire which has burned out of control since it began on Friday at Sampson Flat on Adelaide's northeastern edge.

The boost in numbers on the ground comes ahead of deteriorating weather conditions, with the temperature forecast to hit 38C on Tuesday and again on Wednesday when a late change could also bring shifting winds and the possibility of thunderstorms.

Premier Jay Weatherill on Monday said the response to the fire was now focused on three key areas: containing the blaze; clearing roads to help restore services; and protecting more than 1000 homes in the fire zone which are 'surrounded by fuel that could ignite'.

The premier has confirmed that 38 homes had been destroyed or badly damaged - the number is expected to rise - as had 129 businesses and outbuildings such as farm sheds.

Police on Monday said the cause of the bushfire was still unclear but that an incinerator near Sampson Flat was one line of inquiry that was being investigated.

As the fires continue to rage, police arrested two male teenagers  for allegedly starting a fire at Modbury on Friday night - 30 kilometres from where fire crews are battling blazes. 

No damage was caused in the incident, but both boys have been bailed to appear in the Adelaide Youth Court on February 6.
