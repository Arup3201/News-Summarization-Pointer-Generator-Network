Fraudsters: Mathew Green, 26, would write brazen character references for girlfriend Anne-Marie Read, 36, while she would claim to be an experienced health care assistant. In fact, her only qualification was in yoga

A couple forged each other’s 
references to land jobs in hospitals – then claimed thousands in sick 
pay when one pretended to be too stressed to work.

Fraudsters Anne-Marie Read and Matthew
Green put patients at risk when they conned their way into care jobs 
across the south of England without the right qualifications.

The scam was only uncovered when Read,
36, applied for a third job while still off with ‘stress and anxiety’ 
from two other posts.

Health bosses became suspicious and launched an investigation and the pair, from Southampton, were arrested.

Yesterday they were jailed after a 
court heard how the only qualifications Read possessed came from a yoga 
school.

Green, 26, sobbed as he was handed a 12-month prison sentence 
for fraud. His crimes breached a suspended sentence he was given for 
stealing from a former employer in 2011.

Read, 36, also wept as she was given eight months in prison, suspended for 18 months, as well as 100 hours’ unpaid work.

Sentencing them, the judge, Recorder 
Ann Arnold, said the pair had worked together to expose patients to ‘the
potential of risk’.

Portsmouth Crown Court heard how Read 
had gone home with ‘stress and anxiety’ just two days after starting at 
Gosport War Memorial Hospital in Hampshire – where staff had already 
noticed she lacked key skills for her health care assistant post.

During
the subsequent three months off she claimed more than £2,300 in wages –
and even asked for extra hardship payments.

In the meantime, boyfriend Green wrote
a reference claiming to be her ex-boss so she could secure more work 
with the Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust.

But again Read went off sick within 
days of starting, the court heard. While absent she tried to land a 
third job at a hospital in Surrey but was unsuccessful.

Brazen: The couple were so confident in their deceit that Read attended just her first two days of a job at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, near Portsmouth, before going off sick with 'stress' for three months

The fraudsters used Read’s mother as a
reference by altering her surname and creating a fake email address and
contact details. Read also lied about studying at the Open University 
and Portsmouth University – when her only qualifications actually came 
from the British School of Yoga.

Green, who had been sacked for poor performance and attendance at another NHS Trust, made a series of job applications.

Six failed to get him a post at the 
Royal County Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, but one led to employment
with a hospital in Surrey.

However, Read had lied in his 
reference that she had once been Green’s supervisor as head matron at 
the Winchester hospital and the con was uncovered when health bosses 
decided to investigate the spurious job application.

The pair pleaded guilty in February to a string of fraud charges.

Green, who had depression, was said to
have had a ‘traumatic upbringing’ and put on seven stone in weight 
while the swindle was being investigated.

The couple had also suffered financial
difficulties. Green took out a mortgage of £130,000 on a £136,000 home 
in 2006 only for the pair to be evicted in January after the property’s 
value plummeted.

Read said she was ‘ashamed’ of her behaviour.
