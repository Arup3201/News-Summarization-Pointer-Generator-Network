Fraudulent: Linda Rose Gagnon, 59, has been convicted of stealing the retirement money of nuns from the U.S. Province of the Religious of Jesus and Mary in 2011

A 59-year-old woman has been convicted of an unholy scheme in which she scammed Catholic nuns out of $285,000 to spend on personal luxuries.

California's Linda Rose Gagnon was convicted on Tuesday for stealing the retirement money of sisters from the U.S. Province of the Religious of Jesus and Mary (RJM) in 2008.

Instead of buying the nuns a home with the funds, as promised, she blew it on lingerie, holidays, manicures and valet services for her dog.

According to the indictment, Gagnon ran a Tustin 
company, Rose Enterprises Inc., which represented itself as helping clients with delinquent mortgages and 
other real-estate transactions.

Gagnon, who had once attended a boarding school run by the order, allegedly visited the Rhode Island convent.

When she learned they were interested in buying a San Diego property for the care of elderly and infirm nuns, Gagnon offered to help with the deal despite not having a California real estate license, according to UPI.

'Armed
 with a bogus letter that appeared to be from a California attorney, 
Gagnon convinced the nuns to wire $285,000 from their retirement account
 to be used in the purchase of the property,' a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles said.

Gagnon traveled to one of the order's residences in Rhode Island where she learned about their investment plans. Pictured is the Dina Mission Center, a residence for RJM sisters, in Woonsocket, Rhode Island

The nuns sent the money to Gagnon, who is also known as Linda Gualtieri-Gagnon.

But instead of using the money to buy the house, Gagnon blew the money on personal travel, lingerie, manicures, restaurants, lease payments for an Audi TT sports car, her business and valet pet-sitting services for her dog, OC Weekly reported.

'She paid off $42,000 she borrowed. There was $448 at Chadwick's of London, an intimate apparel store in San Francisco. Then she went shopping at Nordstroms, visited the nail salon and of course a pet-sitting service,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Keenan said, according to Los Angeles Times.

'She also leased an Audi TT sports car...She was living nicely on the nuns' money.'

Law Fuel reported Gagnon spent the cash in just 64 days and brazenly asked the order for another $285,000.

She said she needed the money to buy the house RJMâ€™s first payment was tied up in a 'triple escrow' on another property.

Throughout the trial, Gagnon's lawyer said she accidentally co-mingled the funds.

Los Angeles Times reported Gagnon did not testify, 
but two Catholic priests who took the witness stand to attest to Gagnon's character assured the court 'she is really quite 
honest'.

Jurors in California found Gagnon guilty of three counts of wire fraud.

Gagnon will be sentenced on February 24 and faces up to 60 years in prison - 20 years for each count. The FBI investigated the case.
