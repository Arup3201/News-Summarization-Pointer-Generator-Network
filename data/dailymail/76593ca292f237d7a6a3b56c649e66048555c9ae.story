Savaged: Seven-year-old Aaron Kudray shows the injuries to his face and arm after a dog attack that has left him unable to smile

A seven-year-old boy was savaged by a dog in an horrific attack which has left him unable to smile.

Aaron Kudray, from Moston, Greater Manchester, was playing in the garden when the boxer-bull mastiff cross mauled his face and arms.

The youngster managed to fight the dog off but was left with severe injuries to his face.

He has had to undergo plastic surgery so he will be able to smile again when he's fully recovered.

But the owner of the dog will not be prosecuted - because the attack happened two days before changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act.

The act now says dog owners whose animals attack someone in their own home or on private property can be prosecuted.

But the changes in legislation came in on Tuesday - and Aaron was attacked on Sunday.

Aaron's mother, Paula, is furious the neighbour who owns the dog will not be prosecuted.

The 33-year-old mother-of-four said: 'It's horrific. I am absolutely fuming.

'Aaron
 has had to stay at my mum's, he's so shaken and he can't play outside 
it's not fair for him sitting at home while all the other children play 
out.'

The owner of the dog, an 18-month-old boxer-bull mastiff cross, voluntarily destroyed her pet on Monday.

She attacked Aaron after one of the children he was playing with let her out of the back yard.

Paula said: 'She went straight for Aaron, I think in hindsight because he was holding sweets.

'He
 said he was trying to beat her away with his left arm but every time he
 got up she pinned him back down. I'll never know how he got away.'

Aaron has been left with deep puncture wounds to his left arm and the left side of his face.

Mauled: Aaron has had plastic surgery so he will be able to smile again but doctors said that if the wound had been even a millimetre over the tendons he uses to smile would have been severed, possibly permanently

Doctors
 told Paula if the wound had been even a millimetre over, either left or
 right, the tendons Aaron uses to smile would have been severed, 
possibly permanently.

Paula 
added: 'He came running in holding 
out his arms and then I just saw blood start coming out of his wounds. 
They were so deep.'

The 
changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act, which have been welcomed by Greater 
Manchester Police (GMP) and Police Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd, mean 
there are harsher sentences for people whose dogs attack a person and 
now include attacks which take place on private property.

Paula
 said: 'I think the change in the law is brilliant, but I think there 
should be a loophole that means this woman can be prosecuted.

Aaron was attacked by a boxer-bull mastiff cross like this one. The dog has since been destroyed (file picture)

'She is 
playing the victim because she has had her family pet put down but Aaron
 is the one suffering.'

GMP confirmed there would be no prosecution due to the law only changing two days later.

A
 spokesman said: 'A seven-year-old boy suffered puncture wounds to his 
left arm and a deep bite on his left cheek, he was taken to hospital for
 treatment.

'A second child aged seven was also bitten and had injuries to her leg and scratch marks.

'The owner of the dog voluntarily had the dog destroyed.'
