A businessman has become the first man to have his prostate removed after discovering he was carrying a faulty gene that raises the risk of cancer.

The 53-year-old was told he had the rogue BRCA2 gene after taking part in a clinical trial at the Institute of Cancer Research in London. 

Last week Angelina Jolie revealed that she had had a double mastectomy after discovering that the BRCA1 gene gave her an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer.

Both the BRCA2 and BRCA1 genes have long been known to increase the risk of breast and ovarian forms of the disease but recent research has also linked them to the prostate.

The businessman, who has not been identified but is married with children and lives in London, has other family members who have suffered breast or prostate cancers.

Although his prostate appeared to be perfectly healthy, he was anxious to have it removed to avoid the same fate.

However, doctors were reluctant to operate because the procedure leaves men infertile and can cause permanent incontinence and sexual dysfunction.

An MRI scan and a prostate-specific antigen test – which detects raised levels of a protein linked to cancer – also showed no sign of defects.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year.

Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have prostate cancer for many years.

Symptoms
 often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect
 the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the 
penis).

When this happens, 
you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while
 urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied.

However,
 these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer. It is more likely 
they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(also known as BPH or prostate enlargement).

The doctors only agreed when a tissue sample taken from the gland showed microscopic malignant changes which could be the first indication of cancer.

Professor Roger Kirby, the surgeon who carried out the procedure, said he would still have refused to do it had the patient not also had the faulty BRCA2 gene.

The professor, one of the world’s leading prostate  surgeons, said he is expecting more healthy men to come forward if they discover they are carrying one of the faulty genes.

‘The relatively low level of cancerous cells we found in this man’s prostate before the operation would these days not normally prompt immediate surgery to remove the gland, but given what we now know about the nature of BRCA2, it was definitely the right thing to do for this patient,’ he said.

‘This patient is now absolutely fine. A number of these BRCA families have now been identified, and knowing you are a carrier is like having the sword of Damocles hanging over you.

‘You are living in a state of constant fear. I am sure more male BRCA carriers will now follow suit.’

About one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime and there are about 41,000 new cases in Britain each year.

The
 disease causes just under 10,500 deaths annually, but often it is so 
slow-growing that patients die from another cause first.

Angelina Jolie chose to have a double mastectomy as her chance of developing breast cancer was very high

Last month a study of more than 2,000 men by the Institute of Cancer Research found that men with defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes were a third more likely to be  diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer.

They were twice as likely to have an earlier form of the disease that had spread and tended to live half as long as men without the inherited faulty gene.

Other studies claim affected men are up to four times at risk of cancer.

Hollywood star Miss Jolie, 37, wrote an article in the New York Times last week explaining how she’d had both breasts removed to reassure her six children the illness wouldn’t claim her life.

The Oscar-winning actress described the heartache of losing her mother Marcheline Bertrand at the age of 56 after fighting ovarian cancer for almost a decade.
