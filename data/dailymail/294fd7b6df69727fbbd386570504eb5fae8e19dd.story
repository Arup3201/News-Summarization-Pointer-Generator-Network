The property has gone on the market at £5.5million with a 43-year lease. There is the option to purchase the flat with an extended lease of 120 years, but that will set the new owner back an extra £1.3million

Despite the flat's stunning, spacious living area, its main selling point is the ground-floor ballroom, rebuilt when the block was constructed in 1958

Hiring a ballroom in Mayfair, would typically cost from £7,000 to £10,000 for a day or evening. But use of the ballroom at 17 Grosvenor Square is thrown in free of charge as part of the deal - potentially saving a socialite who loves entertaining the rich and famous thousands of pounds a year

17 Grosvenor Square dates back to the 17th century, but parts were rebuilt after it suffered damage when the area was bombed during the Second World War

The property, which boasts two luxury bathrooms, is valued at more than ten times the average London home and 30 times more than a typical home sold in England and Wales

American presidents, diplomats, earls, aristocrats and MPs may all have graced the dancefloor of 17 Grosvenor Square in its grand history.

The house was originally constructed during the 1720s, as vast mansions were built to create the square.

The square, which takes its name from the Duke of Westminster's surname, was the vision of Sir Richard Grosvenor.

He obtained licences to start building in 1710, with the first of the opulent buildings taking shape in around 1721.

It became one of the most fashionable addresses in London with the early houses boasting five or seven bay windows across three storeys.

Like many of its neighbouring houses, No. 17 was rebuilt in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Under the ownership of Lord Courtenay, the Earl of Devon the house gained dining rooms, drawing rooms, a large dressing room as well as extensive housing for maids and servants downstairs.

It boasted a lavish interior with crimson curtains, Turkish carpets and leather-seated chairs, mahogany furniture as well as busts and bronzes dotting the hallways.

In 1846 the lease was bought by Sir James Weir Hogg MP, the chairman of the East India Company.

He made radical alterations to the house under the guidance of the architect Thomas Hopper.

 half of the house was destroyed by bombing in 1940, and it was demolished in 1943. 

Chimney pieces and other original features were salvaged for preservation and were eventually reassembled after the war.

The garden which lies at the heart of Grosvenor Square was once reserved for the use of residents, but is now a public park.

At one end there lies a small memorial dedicated to the British victims of the September 11 attacks.

Grosvenor Square has been the traditional home of the official American presence in London since 1785, when one of the country's FOunding Fathers John Adams, the second president and first vice president of the U.S. set up the first mission to the Court of St James's.

He lived in the house which stands on the coroner of Brook and Duke streets from 1785 to 1788.

During the Second World War president DWight Eisenhower located the U.S. military headquarters at 20 Grosvenor Square.

The building was used by the U.S. Navy as its European headquarters until 2009.

The American embassy as been based in the square since 1938, but will soon relocate to Nine Elms in the borough of Wandsworth, south of the River Thames when the new building is completed in 2016.

Standing in the square today are two statues honouring Presidents Roosevelt and Eisenhower.
