One of the most memorable moments of last night's final presidential debate was Barack Obama's mocking comparison of Mitt Romney's foreign policy to the era of 'horses and bayonets'.

The barb, which rapidly became popular on social networks, was intended to paint the Republican challenger as inexperienced and out of touch with the realities of modern military conduct.

But the President's mocking comment threw the spotlight on the fighting techniques - because both bayonets and horses have remained important parts of the U.S. military right up to the present day.

Clash: Barack Obama mocked Mitt Romney's complaints over reducing the size of the U.S. naval fleet

Barb: The mocking comment was considered one of the night's highlights by many observers

The crunch exchange came after Romney accused Obama of imprudently cutting back on the country's naval fleet, saying: 'Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.'

The President replied: 'Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.

'We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships.'

The zinger instantly went viral on Twitter and other networks, as Obama supporters took the opportunity to portray his opponent as old-fashioned and clueless about modern warfare.

However, bayonets are still an integral item of military equipment.

Standard issue: The bayonet remains a crucial piece of equipment for U.S. Marines

In use: Bayonet instruction remains part of basic training for Marines, and was part of Army training until 2010

New model: The OKC-3S bayonet has been issued to Marines since 2003

In the U.S. Marine Corps, the bayonet is standard issue, and Marines are instructed in how to use the knives in hand-to-hand combat as part of their basic training.

The current model of bayonet used, the OKC-3S, which is designed to fit on the end of the M16 rifle, first entered service as recently as 2003.

The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have mostly relied on more hands-off techniques such as roadside bombs and aerial attacks, rather than hand-to-hand combat.

However, Marines are nonetheless equipped for a knife fight - and four years ago, a British soldier won the Military Cross after using his bayonet to kill a Taliban militant, having ordered his platoon to affix bayonets because it was 'good for morale'.

In the U.S. Army, bayonet use was part of basic training until 2010, when it was replaced with more general tuition on the correct use of a knife.

Old-fashioned? Special forces troops entered Afghanistan on horseback during the 2001 invasion

Heroic: The troops showed that horses can still be used in combat, though it may seem anachronistic

For most soldiers, a bayonet or other type of blade is the second most important weapon, behind only the rifle.

As well as being a combat weapon, bayonets are used as multi-purpose knives while troops are being deployed overseas.

Horses are less important to modern methods of fighting, but they have not yet been entirely phased out.

In 2001, the first U.S. troops to enter Afghanistan did so by riding into the country alongisde America's allies in the Northern Alliance.

Meme: The debate exchange prompted Obama supporters to mock Romney via social media

For many members of the special operations teams, it was the first time they had ever ridden a horse, but the remote desert landscape did not allow them to use more common methods of transport.

The mission was not without its difficulties - one soldier was forced to ride with a broken back after his horse fell on top of him - but it was a success in the end.

Obviously, neither horses nor bayonets occupy the same central place in the warfare of 2012 as they did during World War I.

But despite what President Obama might suggest, both are still used as tools of battle to this day.
