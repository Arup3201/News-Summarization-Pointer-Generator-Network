If you're after a wild night in bed - this is the place.

A hotel firm in South Africa is offering the chance for guests to sleep under the stars in one of their stunning one-of-a-kind treehouses.

With lush green landscapes stretching out as far as the eye can see, these unique beds are located on the banks of the Sabie River, South Africa, at the Lion Sands game reserve.

Robert More, CEO and founder of MORE, who
run hotels and lodges throughout Southern Africa, including Lion Sands,
said: 'Lion Sands treehouses were built as a unique novelty.

'They were created to fulfill childhood dreams of people sleeping under the African sky and experiencing being one with nature.

'It gets very dark as there is no city light disturbing the magnificent star-studded African skies of the southern hemisphere.

'It is an auditory feast with the African night sounds coming alive in an awe-inspiring, multi-phonic symphony.

'They are built for guests to experience 
the night, in tune with nature. And with no electricity, it's just you 
and the great African outdoors.'

The lodge includes three unique treehouses for guests to enjoy, including Chalkley treehouse, Kingston treehouse, and Tinyeleti treehouse.

All three venues include radio contact with a ranger, on call to ensure guests can enjoy uninhibited wildlife at its best.

Robert More, who run the hotel, says: 'Lion Sands treehouses were built as a unique novelty'

'The main reaction that we get from people who stay at the treehouses is simply "WOW",' explains Mr More, from South Africa.

'It is such a unique experience, not only do you get to enjoy views, but you also receive a picnic dinner in your treehouse, as well as any extras such as a massage.'
