Robin van Persie admits he cannot wait to start playing with the raft of world class signings that have arrived at Manchester United this summer.

In an unprecedented recruitment drive, Louis van Gaal has spent over £150million to bring in six new players - Luke Shaw, Ander Hererra, Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao - as the club look to return past glories.

'I can't wait to go and train and play with the world-class players we have signed - wow!' Van Persie told the club's official website while training with the Holland squad in the Austrian Alps this week.

'That feeling, that we are going to perform well, has only got stronger after the buying of players over the last weeks. I find it very exciting, the arrival of all those new players.'

The 31-year-old is confident the new arrivals can help turn around United's dismal start to the season, which has seen them yet to win a Premier League game and crash out of the Capital One Cup to lowly MK Dons.
