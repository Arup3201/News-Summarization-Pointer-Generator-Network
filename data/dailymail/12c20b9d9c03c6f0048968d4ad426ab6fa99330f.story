Luis Suarez's four-month ban from football for biting Giorgio Chiellini has been upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, but the Barcelona star will be officially unveiled at the Nou Camp on Monday and will train with his new team on Friday morning.

The decision means Suarez will be able to make his Barcelona debut on Monday in the Joan Gamper Trophy friendly against Liga MX side Leon at the Nou Camp if deemed fit enough.

The Uruguayan forward was banned from all football activity on July 1 for the incident during the World Cup group stage match against Italy on June 24 in Natal.

Wait: Suarez has not been officially unveiled in person as a Barcelona player since his £75million move

The 'football activity' aspect of the ban, apart from playing, has been removed, allowing Suarez to be formally unveiled, train, watch the team play and take part in other promotional activities and administrative matters.

Suarez can:

- Train with Barcelona team

- Be officially unveiled by Barcelona

- Play non-official Barcelona games (including friendlies)

- Play in Uruguay friendlies against Japan, Korea and Saudi Arabia in September and October

- Attend games 

- Take part in other promotional activities and administrative matters 

Suarez can't:

- Play for Barcelona in competitive matches until October 26

- Play for Uruguay in competitive fixtures for another eight games

CAS says FIFA's sanctions against Suarez are 'generally proportionate to the offence committed.' 

The 27-year-old will take part in a double training session with Barcelona on Thursday, at 09.30 and 18.30 local time. 

Suarez cannot play for Barcelona until October 26, where the Catalan giants take on Real Madrid in La Liga at the Bernabeu, and he remains banned for Uruguay's next eight competitive matches.

However, the court's panel has ruled that the ban on any soccer-related activity is 'excessive.' 

The court said in a statement: 'The four-month suspension will apply to official matches only and no longer to other football-related activities (such as training, promotional activities and administrative matters).'

Banning Suarez from training would have meant the ban 'would still have an impact on his activity after the end of the suspension,' the panel ruled.

The ex-Liverpool star transferred to Barcelona for £75million after receiving the ban, but has since been unable to be unveiled or train with the team.

The full details of the hearing will be released at a later date. 

Suarez, who has received long-term bans three times previously – twice for biting and once for racially abusing Patrice Evra – has been keeping up his fitness with a personal trainer ahead of his return.
