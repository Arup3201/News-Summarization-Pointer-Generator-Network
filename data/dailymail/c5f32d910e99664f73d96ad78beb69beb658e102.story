Lord Rennard humiliated Nick Clegg yesterday by defying his second request for an apology for making unwanted advances to female party activists.

As the women who complained about the Lib Dem peer’s behaviour claimed they had been ‘branded liars’, party leader Mr Clegg again tried and failed to wring a statement of regret from him.

The complainants are now considering taking legal action for having their ‘reputations trashed’ after the party let its former chief executive escape punishment.

Unrepentant: Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard has humiliated Nick Clegg

They accused Lord Rennard of sexually 
inappropriate touching when he was the Lib Dems’ chief executive and 
also involved in candidate selection.

On Wednesday, a review of the case found their claims were ‘credible’ and that he should apologise for ‘violating their space’.

But
 the QC appointed to investigate, Alistair Webster, said the claims did 
not pass the tough, burden of proof threshold set in criminal cases. 

As
 a result there were no grounds on which to expel him from the party but
 both Mr Webster and Mr Clegg said Lord Rennard should say sorry.

The
 peer refused to do so and retains his position on a key party policy 
board. He is also likely to have the Lib Dem whip reinstated at a House 
of Lords meeting on Monday.

Yesterday
 Mr Clegg tried again when he told LBC radio that Lord Rennard should 
now ‘do the decent thing’. ‘He should apologise,’ said Mr Clegg. 

‘I think it is a matter of very real regret – to put it mildly – that, so far at least, he hasn’t chosen to apologise.’

Nick Clegg last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted Lord Rennard should not rejoin the Lib Dem group in the Lords unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations

But the women involved are so furious at the leaderships’ impotence they have rebuffed Mr Clegg’s attempts to speak to them.

One Lib Dem activist said last night: ‘It is infuriating to think that we are effectively being branded liars.’

And
 one complainant said she wanted to think ‘very seriously’ once the 
‘heat’ had died down whether she and others should take legal action.

Their anger intensified after Lord Carlile, a senior QC, said his friend Lord Rennard had ‘nothing to apologise for’.

‘Astonishingly
 the Liberal Democrats, our party, which has committed against secret 
justice has refused to allow either Lord Rennard or I as his legal 
representative ever to see Alistair Webster’s report. What kind of 
justice system is that?’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.

Mr Clegg was also pressed on his LBC radio show on whether he had failed to deal with the complaints about Lord Rennard. 

Current and former Lib Dem activists took to Twitter to condemn the ruling that Lord Rennard will face no further action

He
 admitted that ‘the buck stops with me’ and added: ‘The party as a 
whole, and myself as leader, we’ve got to take responsibility, [we] 
failed to respond to the concerns first raised.’

Susan Gaszczak, a Lib Dem campaigner, waived her anonymity last night to claim she too had been a victim of Lord Rennard.

Revealing that Mr Clegg had phoned her to apologise, she told Channel 4 News: ‘He needs to be firm.

'We
 should not be calling for women to resign, we should be calling for 
Rennard’s resignation. [And] he has not been found not guilty, either.

'Someone needs to man up here and do something about this.’

Another
 alleged victim, Alison Smith, said: ‘The investigation has no 
credibility with either side and the party needs to start again from 
scratch, this time with transparency.’

Lord
 Paddick of Brixton also angered victims by appearing to blame their 
‘reluctance’ to come forward years ago for the lack of action.

He
 added in an article for the Liberal Democrat Voice website: ‘Justice 
works both ways, however difficult that may be to take.’

Lord Rennard did not respond to calls from the Daily Mail.

NICK Clegg sought to limit the damage over accusations of a cover-up yesterday by insisting that Rennard will not be given any meaningful public role in the party. It was a hollow claim.

Not only will Rennard be back in his usual place on the party’s benches in the House of Lords as early as Monday, he will also be at the next meeting of the party’s influential Federal Policy  Committee later this month.

Far from being exiled to its outer reaches, the party’s former chief executive will be a key figure helping the policy committee to devise the Lib Dems’ 2015 election manifesto.

Lord Rennard said he now plans to return to his roles in the party after the conclusion of the last report into his behaviour

‘Chris (Rennard) is a member of that  committee, whatever the leadership may want,’ said one of the disgraced peer’s friends last night, ‘and he will give it the benefit of all his experience.’

To the dismay of Mr Clegg and his  supporters, who hoped he might quietly drift behind the scenes, Rennard is also planning to stand for re-election to the  policy committee in October (elections  happen every two years).

Buoyed by the 100 letters of support submitted to the internal inquiry by senior party members, Rennard is confident he will be re-elected.

And if, as expected, he wins the support of the majority of the party’s 43,000 activists, his victory will be announced during the Lib Dem autumn conference in Liverpool, guaranteeing even more damaging headlines.

A Lib Dem spokesman said last night: ‘It’s true we can’t stop Lord Rennard attending the Federal Policy Committee meetings, nor can we stop him running for re-election to the committee if he wants to.’

It is a statement that underlines the deep divisions in the party over the Rennard affair and the sense of anger and frustration in the Clegg camp at the outcome of the investigation by the leading QC Alistair Webster.

The impotence of the party leadership is underlined by the fact that Mr Clegg’s call for a public apology from Rennard has been summarily rejected.

‘They wanted to hang Chris out to dry and failed,’ said another senior Lib Dem. ‘This is the worst of all worlds for us, as Chris is wounded but not fatally.’

Rennard’s friends have mocked the inquiry for its secrecy and ineffectiveness.

Lib Dem President Tim Farron said Lord Rennard should apologise

Under Lib Dem rules, Mr Webster was not allowed to speak to any of the ten women who made the sexual harassment allegations against Rennard, and they were allowed only to submit written statements.

And this is a party that prides itself on equality and transparency!

Rennard’s critics say there are two main reasons he has escaped without sanction. First, the Lib Dem party is inherently chauvinistic.

An investigation last year by City fund manager Helena Morrissey after the Rennard affair first broke, found the party failed to live up to its ideals of equality and liberty, and that there was a culture of ‘low-level sexism’ with reports of widespread ‘sexism and misogyny’.

Second, no individual has ever wielded more power and influence or instilled more fear within the Lib Dems than the overweight, balding and bespectacled Rennard.

He is nicknamed Rasputin, after the mystic who mesmerised the Russian Imperial Court under the last Tsar, and he still has immense influence.

A former party agent, he rose to become director of campaigns and elections between 1989 and 2002 and chief executive until 2009.

When Clegg became party leader, he made clear he wanted get rid of Rennard – who had masterminded general election campaigns for Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy – and put his own man in the job.

‘Chris was regarded as too close to Ashdown and Kennedy and therefore too Left wing and too liberal. Having served two leaders, he was also seen by Clegg’s people as too powerful, too set in his ways,’ explained a source.

When Rennard eventually quit as chief executive in 2009 the official explanation was ‘health reasons’.

The truth was he went because the Lib Dem leadership realised the growing number of sex-pest allegations against their married chief executive meant his position was unsustainable.

Mr Clegg, who was glad to see the back of  Rennard, was confident the allegations would never see the light of day, which explains why no action was taken.

It was a bad miscalculation and, given the fury of Rennard’s alleged victims over the ‘whitewash’, the row can now only escalate.

To try to draw a line under the controversy, the party leadership has told MPs not to go on the airwaves.

But not everyone is listening. Tim Farron, the ambitious party president, has been quick to speak out, for example.

‘While this process has not found to a criminal standard of proof that Lord Rennard acted with indecent intent,’ he said, ‘It is clear that he did not behave in the way that a chief executive should behave.

Lord Rennard must reflect on his actions and apologise to the women involved.’

Mr Farron, who is no fan of Nick Clegg, hopes to be the next Lib Dem leader. And the more mud that sticks to Clegg over the Rennard affair, the more likely that is  to happen.
