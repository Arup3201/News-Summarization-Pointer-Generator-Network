The parents of the gifted student gunned down on Boxing Day made an emotional pilgrimage yesterday to the spot where he died.

Subhash Bidve and his wife Yogini travelled more than 4,200 miles from their home in India to the Salford street where Anuj, 23, was shot.

Mr Bidve comforted his wife as she sobbed uncontrollably before they laid flowers and a wreath, and studied the many tributes left at the spot in the deprived area of Ordsall.

Then, at the request of the family, news photographers turned off their cameras as they knelt down and prayed.

Anuj and some friends had strayed into the neighbourhood in the early hours of the morning as they made their way into Manchester for the sales.

The post-graduate engineering student at Lancaster University was apparently shot in the head at point-blank range despite replying ‘politely’ when his attacker asked him the time.

The family’s visit came as David Cameron, also visiting the area, condemned the ‘horrific’ killing.

In a phone call, he assured Mr Bidve that ‘everything possible’ would be done to bring his son’s killer to justice.

Mr Bidve, a former Indian Air Force officer who works as a general manager, said: ‘Anuj was our only son and we cannot comprehend this dreadful tragedy.

'We have made the journey to see Anuj, see the place where he died, and most importantly take Anuj home with us.

‘When he left India in September, he was full of hope and ambition.

'We were all so very proud of him.’

He added: ‘We have been deeply moved and taken comfort from the hundreds of messages from the people in Salford and Lancaster. We would like to say thank you.’

The couple had taken out a £25,000 loan to enable their son to travel to the UK.

They were due to fly home with his body last night.

During his trip to Salford earlier in the day, Mr Cameron said that Anuj Bidve's life had been,'cruelly and brutally ended'.

'My message, on behalf of the whole country, is one of huge sympathy and understanding to them.

'An absolutely horrific act has taken their son away from them, and it is absolutely essential the Greater Manchester Police do everything they can to get to the bottom of what happened and make sure the person is rightly brought to justice and there is a very tough punishment.

'It's unacceptable to have this sort of crime going on in our country.'

This is the family's statement in full:

'We have made the journey from India 
in order to see Anuj, see the place where he died, and most importantly 
take Anuj home with us.

'Whilst in England we have taken the 
opportunity to meet a number of other people who were involved in Anuj’s
life and to achieve our goal of taking Anuj back home with us as soon 
as possible.

'As you can imagine this has been an exceedingly difficult journey to make.

'When Anuj left India in September last year he was full of hope and ambition for the future. We were all so very proud of him.

'Anuj was our only son and we cannot comprehend this dreadful tragedy.

'We do not blame the people of this 
city for what happened. The only person we blame is the man responsible 
for taking Anuj away from us in such a senseless act of violence on 
Boxing Day morning.

'We have been deeply moved and have 
taken comfort from the hundreds of messages we have received from the 
people in Salford and Lancaster and especially the Indian community and 
would like to take this opportunity to say thank you.

'We have been overwhelmed by the reaction and interest of the media both at home in India and here in the United Kingdom.

'We would like to thank the police 
for the manner in which this investigation has been conducted. We are 
confident in the British justice system and sincerely hope that this 
will eventually bring justice for Anuj.

'We now wish to have some time on our
own to take in the enormity of the situation and say some prayers for 
Anuj at the very place where he died.'

Yesterday, they collected his belongings from Lancaster University and met his friends and tutors.

The family met with Home Affairs Select 
Committee chairman Keith Vaz for 35 minutes on Thursday to discuss the 
police investigation into their son's death and to plead for justice.

Mr Vaz pledged to get a full report on 
the incidents surrounding the death of Mr Bidve following the completion
of the criminal proceedings. He said it was needed to help the family 
get closure.

The couple flew into the UK on Wednesday with brother-in-law Rakesh Sonawane.

Kiaran Stapleton, 20, of Ordsall, has been charged with his murder. He has been remanded in custody.

Police last week said they were treating the killing as a 
‘hate crime’ which may have been racially motivated.
