Harry Gurney insists the Sri Lanka rainy season cannot blow England's World Cup preparations off course.

Gurney is one of the two specialists, alongside four all-rounders for this seven-match one-day international series, in a seam attack which is relatively inexperienced in the injury-enforced absence of Stuart Broad and James Anderson.

But the 28-year-old, speaking after England's second practice session of the tour, is confident both he and his team-mates will rise to the challenge and will have ample opportunity to do so - despite the threat of curtailment from daily storms here.

The established weather pattern puts day-night matches - of which there are four - in particular peril, because rain clouds routinely build up by teatime.

Five reserve days are available, but if current conditions persists - as many expect - even they may not be enough to allow for 100 overs.

Before then, England have to dodge the storms too in practice and then two warm-up matches on Friday and Sunday.

Sawdust for the bowlers was much in evidence to help the bowlers at the SSC nets on Wednesday.

But Gurney said: 'Being English, we're all used to a bit of rain. So that doesn't bother anyone really.

'Turning up and having slightly damp footholds is not something any of us are fazed by.'

Extreme humidity is another occupational hazard with which he can happily cope.

'It is quite warm,' said Gurney. 'But most of the guys have been over here in March-April time, when it is really stinking hot.

'This feels relatively pleasant compared to that, so we're okay with it.'

As for the further outlook, Gurney has no doubt he and his fellow World Cup hopefuls will beat the weather to state their case for inclusion in the squad Down Under early next year.

'Most of the ODIs have reserve days, so I think we'll probably get a conclusion in most of if not all the games,' he said.

'If there are shorter games, it gives us the opportunity to go out there and maybe approach it with a different tactic.

'You're going to get presented with circumstances like that in World Cups. So why not be prepared for it?'
