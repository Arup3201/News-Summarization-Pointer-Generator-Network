They should be so lucky - as it’s not every day someone this famous pops in for a surprise concert.

Kylie Minogue dazzled the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall last night at St James's Palace when she performed by royal appointment - and Charles even pulled off some dance moves.

The 44-year-old Australian pop princess sang three pared-down songs for the Prince and Camilla at a reception to mark their Diamond Jubilee tour, which begins next month.
