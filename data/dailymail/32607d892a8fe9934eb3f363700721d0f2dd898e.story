Alvaro Negredo wants to leave Manchester City and return to Spain.

City have insisted the 28-year-old striker is not for sale but it is understood he wants to join Atletico Madrid.

Crowd favourite Negredo nicknamed 'The Beast' scored 23 goals for City last season but was left out of Spain's World Cup squad after drifting out of Manuel Pellegrini's starting XI towards the end of the season.
