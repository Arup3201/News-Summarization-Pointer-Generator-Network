A holidaymaker whose dress caught fire during a dream holiday was saved - by the Marks and Spencer bikini she was wearing underneath.

Mother-of-three Rachel Smith, 43, became engulfed in flames after a she leaned over a mosquito-repelling tealight, which ignited a tassel on the £45 beach dress she had bought especially for her break.

She tried to pat down the flames but when her dress kept burning she was forced to throw herself into a cold shower to put them out.

Terrifying: Rachel became engulfed in flames after a tea-light set ignited a tassel on the £45 tunic she had bought especially for her break and left her with these terrible scars

The HR adviser suffered third-degree 
burns across 40 per cent of her body with painful sores developing on 
her armpits, back, arms and hands.

But
she was saved from even worse injuries and possibly death because her 
M&S bikini protected her chest, private parts and face.

She
spent four weeks in hospital and will be scarred for life but doctors 
told her she could have died if she hadn't been wearing the swimwear.

The bikini top acted as a barrier - stopping the flames reaching her head.

Rachel, of Cheltenham, Gloucester., said: 'It was terrifying, I screamed for my husband as I frantically tried to put out the flames.

'But less than two seconds later I was engulfed. It was just so quick.

'I was expecting it to smoulder a bit, like a tea towel does if you accidentally set fire to it, but it just went whoosh.

Painful: She suffered third-degree burns across 40 per cent of her body with painful sores developing on her armpits, back, arms and hands

'I
dropped to the floor and tried to roll around to put it out but it was 
no good, I could feel the flames burning my skin and the pain was 
excruciating.

'It
all happened so quickly, I just remember that I ran through the living 
room, on fire in front of my son, and got into the shower.

'There
were just remnants left of my white cotton tunic dress, but incredibly 
my M&S bikini was still intact, although a little smoke damaged and a
bit singed in places.

'If it wasn't for the bikini protecting me I could have died. If I'd have got many more burns it probably could have killed me.

Remnants: As she was cooking she leaned over a tealight - setting fire to her cotton White Stuff beach dress (L) - luckily her £35 bikini (R) saved some areas from injury

Scarred for life: Despite calling an ambulance straight away Rachel was forced to wait three hours for it to arrive - and then medics failed to recognise the severity of her burns

'I'm
quite thankful I had that on underneath really because it stopped it 
spreading up to my chest and then my face, I dread to think how much 
worse it could have been.'

The
incident happened one night into a week-long break with husband Mark, 
44, and son Toby, seven, in Carvoeiro, Portugal, last August.

Rachel,
who has two children from a previous marriage, had bought mosquito-repelling tealights as Toby was suffering a number of bites.

But as she was cooking she leaned over one, setting fire to her floaty, cotton White Stuff beach dress.

Despite
calling an ambulance straight away Rachel was forced to wait three 
hours for it to arrive. And when the medics eventually arrived, they did not recognise the severity of 
her burns.

She was taken to hospital in Alvor 
where doctors who spoke little English left her in agony overnight, with a
just a cold towel on her back and arms.

Within days her injuries were 
blistering, and her right arm even turned yellow and green due to the 
severity of the burns, but still doctors refused to do anything but 
apply water and cream.

Rachel spent three weeks in these 
appalling conditions, including her birthday, before British doctors 
arranged to have her flown back to a specialist burns unit at Frenchay 
Hospital in Bristol.

By the time she arrived, however, it was too late for doctors to attempt a skin graft and she was discharged a week later.

Rachel is now forced to wear 
uncomfortable pressure garments 23 hours a day, and will have to keep 
them on for at least the next 18 months while her scars heal naturally.

Too late: She was flown back to a hospital in Bristol but by the time she arrived it was too late for doctors to attempt a skin graft and she was discharged a week later

She is still in extreme pain and has hypertrophic (raised) scarring on her back, flank and under her arms.

Rachel added: 'If I'd been wearing something less flammable, I wouldn't be in the situation I am today

'I honestly can't believe my £35 bikini saved my life, it is unbelievable that it didn't go up in flames.

'The last year has been very testing 
for me, you never expect something like that to happen to you and I 
think it's everyone's worst nightmare.

'I'm still in agony one year on, and 
will be horrendously scarred for life. I've gone from being a confident 
woman who liked my appearance to a shell of my former self.'

She is now warning others about the dangers of flammable clothes.

Back at home: Rachel was left with 40 per cent body burns after the dress set alight (pictured right at her home in Cheltenham wearing a special pressure vest to help ease burn scarring)
