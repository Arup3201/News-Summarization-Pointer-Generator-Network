Nik Wallenda may have completed an incomprehensible feat by calmly staying on a tightrope between Chicago skyscrapers last night - but it appears that his ratings took a tumble.

The daredevil's successful walks on Sunday were watched by an average of 5.8 million Discovery Channel viewers  - compared to 8.5 million people who watched him cross the Grand Canyon in 2013.

On Sunday night, the average peaked at 6.7 million people who tuned in to watch him walk the tightrope while wearing a blindfold - but that fell far short of the peak of 13 million viewers last year.

Last year's stunt shattered records across social media platforms as Wallenda's walk generated 1.3 million tweets - making it the top social show in the U.S., Deadline reported.

Crowd pleaser: Nik Wallenda is pictured as he crosses a tightrope between two Chicago skyscrapers on Sunday evening. Around 6.7 million people tuned in to watch this part of his stunt

Astonishing: Wallenda is pictured making his tightrope walk uphill at a 19-degree angle from the Marina City west tower across the Chicago River to the top of the Leo Burnett Building on Sunday evening

Sunday's feat was broadcast on a ten-second delay on the Discovery Channel in case Wallenda, who was not wearing a safety harness, fell from the rope - giving the network a chance to cut away.

Entertainment Weekly pointed out that November is a more competitive time of the year for ratings compared to June, when he walked across the Grand Canyon.

The city said that about 65,000 people watched Sunday night's event in person - as Wallenda broke Guinness World Records for the highest inclined tightrope walk and the highest blindfolded walk.

The first wire was suspended more than 500ft above the Chicago River at a 19-degree incline; it was supposed to be suspended at 15 degrees, but a last-minute change made for a steeper challenge.

The 35-year-old completed it in six minutes and 52 seconds. He had planned to take a selfie halfway along the rope but decided the winds were too high to attempt it.

Second, he donned a blindfold for a shorter walk between two skyscrapers and completed it in one minute, 17 seconds. Before the walk, he said it was going to be the toughest challenge of his career.

Crowds: The city of Chicago said that about 65,000 people watched Sunday night's event in person 

If he slipped, Wallenda intended to grab the wire as he fell, at which point rescuers would be able to slide down the wire to catch him.

He said that he would be able to cling on to the wire for as long as 30 minutes waiting for rescue - but luckily, there was no need. 

His next televised stunt will come next July when he is aiming to retrace the steps of his great-grandfather, Karl Wallenda, and cross Georgia's Tallulah Gorge.

He hopes to walk the rope at the same time footage of his great-grandfather plays - but he has yet to master the two headstands the older man completed on the rope in July 1970.
