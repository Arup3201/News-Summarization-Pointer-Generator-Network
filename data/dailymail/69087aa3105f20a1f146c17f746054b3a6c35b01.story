A YOUNG mother whose son had been sent home from hospital despite being desperately ill with pneumonia was devastated to find him dead in his bed.

But that was only the beginning of the nightmare for 20-year-old Abby Podmore.

Within an hour she was arrested on suspicion of murdering Alfie, three.

She said ‘heavy-handed’ police sent two riot vans and 17 officers to arrest her and she was held for questioning overnight.

Miss Podmore was released the following day after post mortem examination results revealed the child had died of natural causes.

Devastated Miss Podmore soon found that a white police tent had been erected outside her home, and she was arrested on suspicion of murder just hours after her son's death.

She was kept in custody overnight until a doctor acting under orders from the local coroner informed police that Alfie had died from natural causes.

The dental nurse, from Quinton, Birmingham, has been unable to return home since the incident, with some members of the local community believing she played some part in little Alfie's death.

Alfie was sent home from nursery on February 2 this year after he became unwell.

He was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital the following day, suffering a high temperature, a rash and pain in his left shoulder.

Doctors diagnosed the child with a gastric illness and prescribed him anti-acid medication before sending him home.

But a post-mortem later revealed that he had suffered from pneumonia, a bacterial infection and septicaemia.

He started improving, but the following day, February 6, he became ‘very restless’ and she was up with him until 4am. She said: ‘When I eventually woke up the following day my first thought was to check on him.

‘I ran upstairs and he was lying  on the bottom of his bed and  wasn’t breathing.

‘He was freezing cold and had blood coming out of his nose. I started trying to resuscitate him while phoning the ambulance. I was terrified.’

Miss Podmore, who is trained in life support, continued trying to revive Alfie until paramedics arrived. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police arrived shortly afterwards and told her to change her clothes and leave her house and stay at her brother’s home around the corner. She followed their instructions but now suspects they were already making preparations to preserve the scene and keep her clothes for forensic analysis.

Miss Podmore has hit out at police, saying that she feels she was denied the chance to grieve properly for her dead son.

She said: 'I was still struggling to cope with the news that my little boy had passed away when police officers came to tell me I was being taken into custody on suspicion of my son's murder. I wasn't even allowed to see his body for 10 days after he died.

'I am ashamed that they would even think that I would do that to my child who was my world and my everything.

‘My son had just died and I was thrown into a cell and branded a murderer,’ said Miss Podmore, who is separated from Alfie’s father.

‘I’ve been robbed of my chance to say goodbye to him and this has ruined my life.’

The grieving mother has made formal complaints to both the hospital, which admits it ‘let Alfie down’, and West Midlands Police.

However officers have still not explained what prompted them to arrest her.

She suspects that a neighbour told police she heard crying that night, but she said the noise would have been made by Alfie because he was in pain.

Miss Podmore, who has not been able to return home since Alfie died due to the stigma surrounding her arrest, said that she wants others to avoid her experiences.

She said: 'I love my little boy and did the very best I could for him. When he became ill my mother took him to hospital and when I got to the hospital we were later told he had a simple gastric illness and to take him home.

'The police later told us that things should have been done differently, they apologised and said that police protocols were not correctly followed but my whole life has been turned upside down because of what happened.

'I haven't even been able to return home or grieve properly and I wouldn't want anyone else to suffer as I have. I hope that speaking out will ensure valuable lessons are learnt.'

Miss Podmore has also made a formal complaint to the police and this is being investigated by the Professional Standards Department.

Guy Forster, a medical law expert from the Birmingham office of Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, who is representing the family, said: 'For Abby the past six months have been unbearable; firstly suffering the unimaginable pain of losing her only child and then being wrongly blamed for his death.

'Abby and her partner, who was also arrested, are still suffering as a result of the heavy-handed actions of the Police and feel that they have lost their good name and reputation, with some members of the local community wrongly being led to believe they had some part in Alfie's death.'

A full inquest is now listed to take place on 29 September 2011 at Birmingham Coroners Court.

A spokesman for the hospital said: ‘Investigations are still ongoing but it has become clear that there was more that we could have done to help Alfie.’
