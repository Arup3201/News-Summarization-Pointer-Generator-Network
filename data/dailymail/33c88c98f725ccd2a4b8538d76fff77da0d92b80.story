Microsoft is developing a smartwatch to take on Apple's much anticipated iWatch, a new patent has revealed.

It outlines plans for a wristwatch that would serve as a fitness tracker and could also function as a music player, phone and messaging device.

The watch face itself detaches from the wristband and connects to a charging dock.

The U.S. Patent Office has released an application from Microsoft for a smartwatch design that could challenge offerings from rivals such as Samsung, Apple and Google.

Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but previous rumours claim:

The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue.

It will be made of oxynitride aluminium, a translucent form of the metal.

Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8.

Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet.

The application was filed in October 2012, but has only just been released by the The U.S. Patent Office.

It shows the gadget being used primarily as a fitness tracker, with an icon hinting it will include a pulse-reading sensor.

The project is believed to be headed up by former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who runs Microsoft's Devices division.

The move will put Microsoft in a market set to explode as all the major manufacturers release their watches

Microsoft will be playing catch-up to Samsung, which released its Galaxy Gear smartwatch last year.

Google plans to release the Moto 360 smartwatch in the U.S. this summer, along with a range of other Android powered watches, while Apple has long been rumored to be developing a smartwatch of its own.

Several firms have already made a success of smelling hi-tech watches, such as Pebble which says it sold 400,000 smartwatches last year.

Earlier rumours claimed Microsoft drafted in the team behind its Surface tablet to help test prototypes of its smartwatch.

Microsoft's design allows the watchface to be taken out of the strap entirely, possibly allowing it to be placed in other straps or holders for different sports.

According to technology site The Verge, sources familiar with Microsoft's Surface plans revealed the company had taken the steps to try and get its wearable tech to market.

These claims follow rumours that emerged in April which stated Microsoft was working on a touch-enabled watch as the company aims to cash in on the anticipated boom in wearable electronics.

At the time, the computing giant reportedly asked 
Asian suppliers to ship 1.5in displays for a potential watch-style 
device and one supply executive said he had met with Microsoft 
researchers and developers.

Whether
 Microsoft will actually end up producing the watch is uncertain, but 
some investors and technology firms are expecting a boom in wearable 
electronics, reported the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. company experimented with smartwatches in 2004 with a product called SPOT, which used FM radio signals to send instant messages and view news headlines, reported CNN.

But production ceased four years later and the SPOT project, which stood for Smart Personal Object Technology, was eventually pulled last year.

The new Microsoft watch is believed to have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue.

It is also thought to be made of oxynitride aluminium, a translucent form of the metal and will run a version of Windows 8.

Earlier this week Apple was said to be hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its own smartwatch - dubbed the iWatch.

Apple fan and artist Martin Hajek created these incredible lifelike mockups of an iWatch, whcih he believes could come in two version, with the top of the range being the iWatch S, which has a metal body and leather strap

Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours

Some gadgets such as Nike’s FuelBand are intended to measure physical exercise, while others can perform similar functions to a smartphone such as receiving text messages or taking photos.

California-based startup firm Pebble Technology now makes a watch that wirelessly synchronises with smartphones and vibrates to alert users of incoming phone calls, emails and Twitter posts.

And a group of students from India have already begun selling an Android-powered watch called Andoirdly.

One research firm anticipates the market for wearable smart electronics to be a £7billion industry within just three years.

College students from India have launched the first fully-featured Android smart watch with built-in Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi and a camera. The Androidly device can also be used to make calls and send texts and costs £150
