These are the adorable images of a mother and baby polar bear sharing a tender moment in the snow.

The cute cub can be seen cheekily pulling on his mother's tail to get her attention and prancing about in the snow.

And it looks like his pleas for affection paid off as his mother gently tickled his tummy before scooping him up in her arms for a cuddle.

Excuse me: The baby polar bear bit his mother's tail and was then tickled on the belly at Moscow Zoo, Russia

The images were captured by 
photographer Sergei Gladyshev at Moscow Zoo who said he often 
photographs this family of polar bears.

He said: ‘Last winter the polar bear mum had three cubs.

‘All
 three are different, one is always hungry, the second loves to chase 
crows and this one just likes to lie on the ground and get cuddles from 
mum.

‘I often visit the zoo 
to watch and photograph the cubs, it's lovely to just sit and watch them
 playing and being cared for by their mum.

‘You can tell the mother bear loves all her cubs the same and it's lovely to watch her interactive with them all individually.’

In the wild female polar bears den by digging into deep snow drifts, which provide protection and insulation from the Arctic elements.

They give birth in winter, usually to twins. Young cubs live with their mothers for some 28 months to learn the survival skills they need to survive.

Although these polar bears look cute, females aggressively protect their young and can be a danger to himans.
