A top lieutenant of one of Mexico's most feared drugs cartels, who was wanted in connection with the shooting of two U.S. customs officers, has been paraded in front of the media after being captured without a shot being fired.

The United States government had offered a $5 million dollar reward for the capture of Jesus 'El Mamito' Rejon, who is said to have been partly responsible for the shooting of two U.S. Customs agents earlier this year.

Agent Jaime Zapata was killed and his colleague Victor Avila wounded in the leg, when the armoured car they were travelling in was ambushed by suspected gang members.

Mexican security sources say El Mamito, which translates as 'Pretty Boy', was travelling with a Mexico City police officer who was brokering the his passage through the region.

Both he and the police officer were arrested without a shot being fired.

Proud: Mr Zapata, was fiercely dedicated to his job despite the risks. He also loved to fish, travel to Mexico and barbecue with friends

Rejon is a founding member and 
currently third in command of the feared Zeta Cartel, which was started 
by former Mexican special forces soldiers and is considered to be one of
the country's most brutal criminal organisations.

A
week after the Agent Zapata was killed, Mexican police arrested an 
alleged Zeta cartel hit man who is believed to have organised the 
ambush.

He told authorities
that they had attacked the U.S. agents by mistake because the Zetas 
thought their car belonged to a rival gang.

Turf
wars between the Zetas and other cartels have transformed parts of 
Mexico into lawless killing grounds and scared away some foreign 
investors.

Around 40,000 
people have died in Mexico's drug wars since President Felipe Calderon 
took office in December 2006.

Calderon has deployed the military to the 
streets to attack the powerful cartels.

Rejon,
whose true age is not known, served in an elite unit of the Mexican 
army, which included a stint at the attorney general's office, before 
deserting in 1999.

That 
year he joined up with 13 others, most of them former soldiers, to 
create the Zetas, initially the paramilitary protection force for the 
powerful Gulf cartel.

The 
Zetas split from the Gulf cartel early last year to form their own 
trafficking organization, and the battle between the two has been among 
the bloodiest in the country's ongoing drug war.

Earlier
on Monday, Mexican forces raided a Zetas camp in Nuevo Leon where they 
found a stockpile of weapons, including 18 assault rifles.

Security: Federal police agents standing guard by Rejon fear he and they could be attacked by gangsters

Humbled: Rejon, a former commando, is paraded in his chains
