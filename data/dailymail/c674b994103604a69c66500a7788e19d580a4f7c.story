Hong Kong has culled 20,000 chickens and closed a major poultry market after the bird flu virus was discovered.

Authorities have banned local farms from selling to the Cheung Sha Wan poultry market just two days before Chinese New Year, when traders usually see a big boost in sales.

The city has also blocked imports of fresh chicken from mainland China for 21 days after the H7N9 virus was discovered in a shipment from the southern province of Guangdong.

Authorities in Hong Kong have ordered the cull of 20,000 chickens after the bird flu virus was discovered

A shipment from southern Gunagdong province contained the H7N9 strain of the virus which can spread to humans

The market will also remain closed for 21 days until February 18 for cleaning and disinfection.

'Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department officers will inspect all the local chicken farms and collect more samples for testing to ensure that local farms are not affected by H7 avian influenza,' Secretary for Food and Health Dr Ko Wing-man said in a statement.

The H7N9 virus passes easily between birds and could develop the ability to spread from human-to-human, causing a global pandemic.

So far this year around 19 people have died in China from the disease, including two in Hong Kong

The flu is difficult to spot because it does not make the animals visibly ill and can pass between them easily

While the disease does not pass easily between people, scientists fear it could mutate and cause a pandemic

Staff members of Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department have carried out the cull today, gassing the chickens with carbon dioxide.

The health minister has also said the government is considering separating local and imported birds to stop the need for large culls in the future.

Two people infected with H7N9 bird flu have died in Hong Kong and a third patient is being treated. All three were infected during visits to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.

The H7N9 bird flu virus emerged in March last year and has so far infected at least 240 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Department of Health.

China's official Xinhua news agency, citing the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said 19 people had died of the flu in China this year.

Fears are growing for more human infections as the cull comes just two days before Chinese New Year, where chicken is a popular dish in feasts

The birds were gassed using carbon dioxide before being put into black bin bags and wheelie bins and taken away

Hong Kong has also banned imports of fresh chicken from mainland China to try and stop the disease spreading

China's Health and Family Planning Commission reported a further nine cases of H7N9 bird flu to the World Health Organization on Sunday and Monday.

Hong Kong last suspended live poultry imports in 2011 after a dead chicken tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu at the same market.

The cull marks the first time that the virus has been found in imported poultry
