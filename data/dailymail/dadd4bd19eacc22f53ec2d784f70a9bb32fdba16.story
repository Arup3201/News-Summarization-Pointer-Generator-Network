Welsh keeps a personal profile on the modelling and photography website Model Mayhem, which contains seductive photos of her wearing lingerie.

A working photographer, who asked to remain anonymous, told MailOnline that Welsh had hired him on three separate occasions to take photos of her and paid him several hundred dollars for the shots that were never published until now.
