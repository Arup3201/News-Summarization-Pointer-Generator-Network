A third premature baby has died after being fed using a contaminated hospital feed drip.

The infant was given a tainted batch of a fluid called total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at Cambridge's Rosie Hospital, and died on Sunday after battling blood poisoning for several weeks.

Investigators now believe up to 23 babies were fed using the tainted batch at 11 intensive care units across England. Three have died.

Tragic: A third baby has died after being given a contaminated batch of drip feed which affected 23 newborns. The latest death was at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, on the same site as Addenbrooke's (pictured)

The baby was fed using the tainted drip on May 27, the same day authorities believe it was delivered by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma.

Health chiefs previously believed there were 22 cases - 18 confirmed and four possible - but the infant who died this weekend has now been linked to the ongoing investigation.

A
 spokesman for Public Health England said: 'Since the last update on 
June 12, 2014, a further case has been identified and the total number 
of cases linked to this investigation is 23 - 19 confirmed and four 
possible cases.

'This baby 
has sadly died and our thoughts are with the family. This is the third 
confirmed case to have died and all three cases have been reported to 
the coroner.

Scandal: The babies were fed on a drip because they were too premature to feed, but became ill after being given an infected batch (file picture)

'The baby most 
recently identified received the implicated batch of TPN from May 27, 
2014, but did not immediately develop sepsis so did not fit the case 
definition of the outbreak at that time.

'However, recent microbiological tests have shown the presence of the outbreak strain.'

Produced by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma, TPN is designed to feed babies born prematurely who are too weak to eat on their own.

The most recent victim of the tainted batch, who has not been named, fell ill several weeks ago at the Rosie, which is on the same site as Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital and run by the same health trust.

A spokesman for the trust said: 'Our 
thoughts are with the family and we are supporting them during this very
 difficult and emotional time.

'A consultant neonatologist has spoken to all of the families on the unit.

'The
 babies on the unit have been closely monitored for any signs of 
infection since we withdraw the contaminated feed. We are confident that
 no other newborns have contracted bacillus cereus.

'The two other babies who were ill are stable and doing well.'

Outbreaks have occurred across England, including at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation 
Trust, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, The Whittington 
Hospital and the Harley Street Clinic.

Outside London other outbreaks have been at Brighton & Sussex University Hospital NHS Trust, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Peterborough City
 Hospital, Southend University Hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and
Basildon University Hospital.

The first baby to die was nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush on June 1 at St Thomas' Hospital, London.

Upsetting: 11 hospitals in England were affected. The Rosie Hospital based at Addebrooke's in Cambridge now has three cases, a rise from the two investigators had previously linked to the contaminated drips

The second was not named but died 
midway through last month. Officials said at the time that the death did
 not appear to be linked to the infection itself.

Investigators have almost finished their inquiry and believe the contamination was an 'isolated incident'.

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is used to slowly drip-feed patients who are too weak to eat.

It is not just used for babies - patients commonly receive it directly into their bloodstream for 10 or 12 hours at a time.

It is believed the contaminated batch contained the bacteria Bacillus cereus.

The bacteria are often found in cooked foods like rice and soups which have been left at room temperature for too long.

They produce toxins which cause diahorrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting when eaten.

But because the toxins were injected directly into the bloodstream and the patients were babies with a poor immune system, they would have had a more serious effect.

How the bacteria could have ended up inside a medical drip is still being investigated.

Professor
 Mike Catchpole, incident director at Public Health England, said: 'The main findings
 have all pointed towards there being a single incident that occurred on
 one day.

'We
 are reassured that this was a very rare occurrence as we have not seen 
this particular strain of bacteria in any product made since that day 
and there has been no further illness.'

Gerald Heddell, a director at the Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA), added: 'At this
 stage, our investigation has provided sufficient evidence to indicate 
that the contamination was introduced into the specific Total Parenteral
 Nutrition (TPN) supplies during manufacture in a particular sterile 
manufacturing area at ITH Pharma on May 27, 2014.

'There
 is no evidence to suggest that individual ingredients, components or 
materials used for the manufacture of TPN on May 27, 2014, were the 
cause of the contamination.

'However,
 what we do know from our investigation is that the strain of Bacillus 
cereus which infected the babies has also been identified at ITH 
Pharma’s manufacturing facility and within some of the unopened TPN 
supplies manufactured on May 27, 2014.

'From
 our investigation to date, we continue to believe this was an isolated 
incident and that appropriate immediate action has been taken at ITH 
Pharma’s facility to avoid a recurrence.

'Therefore we are allowing this critical product to be supplied to patients while our investigation continues.'
