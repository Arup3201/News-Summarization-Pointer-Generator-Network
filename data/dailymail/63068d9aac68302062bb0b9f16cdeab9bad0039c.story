Gunmen have abducted a female Chinese tourist and a hotel receptionist from a dive resort in eastern Malaysia before escaping by sea, according to police.

The group of armed men allegedly snatched the two women from a hotel on the idyllic Singamata Reef Resort in Semporna, Sabah, before fleeing the scene by boat.

The gang of six men, who are believed to be Philippine rebels, grabbed the 29-year-old tourist and the 40-year-old hotel worker at around 10.30pm on Wednesday night, local time.

Terror: Tourists take cover next to an overturned table as the gang stormed the hotel in Sabah and abducted a Chinese tourist and a Philippine hotel worker

Shock: Around 60 tourists, mostly from China and Europe, were in the mid-range hotel at the time, and one holidaymaker, a Chinese journalist, said he heard the sound of someone running as well as a woman screaming

Some local reports suggested that the tourist was taking a bath in her hotel room when she was abducted.

Around 60 tourists, mostly from China and Europe, were in the mid-range hotel at the time, and one holidaymaker, a Chinese journalist, said he heard the sound of someone running as well as a woman screaming.

Another witness said they say the alleged kidnappers climb into a boat, and said the two women were both calling out for help.

Tourists were seen hiding under tables as armed men stormed the hotel.  

Destination: The picturesque resort is just a short boat ride from the southern Philippines, where Muslim militants and kidnap gangs have long found safe haven

The missing receptionist is reportedly also from the Philippines, and Malaysian security services are patrolling the waters between the two countries.

Eastern Sabah Security Command Director Mohammad Mentek said: 'We have handed this to the police to quickly investigate and come up with full report.'

The raid underlines persistent 
security threats in Sabah, a popular tourist destination and dive spot which is famed for its cottages on stilts over the water.

It
 will likely add to negative sentiment in China over the safety of its 
citizens in Malaysia, which is still hunting for a jetliner that went 
missing March 8 with 153 Chinese people on board.

Chinese embassy officials in Malaysia have met Sabah's chief of police and the state's tourism minister, urging them to confirm and investigate the incident quickly.

Insurgents in the nearby islands of the southern Philippines have carried out similar kidnappings for ransom against tourists in the region before.

The missing tourist has been confirmed as coming from Shanghai, and the Chinese consulate have issued an emergency telephone number for concerned families.

A receptionist at the hotel declined to comment, as did police in the district.

A Philippines intelligence official said the attackers were believed to be from the Abu Sayaff group, a militant Muslim group that claims allegiance to al-Qaida and has been implicated in other kidnappings for ransom in the region before.

A Malaysian naval ship patrols the waters off Semporna in 2000 when 21 European tourists and Malaysian and Filipino workers were abducted from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort

Last November, suspected Abu Sayyaf militants shot and killed a Taiwanese tourist and kidnapped his wife from a resort in the Semporna area.

The women was released a month later in the southern Philippines. Authorities have not disclosed whether a ransom was paid.

The Abu Sayyaf had tenuous historical links to international militant networks, including al-Qaida, but a U.S.-assisted Philippine military crackdown on the group's heartland in Sulu province in the southern Philippines has weakened it considerably in recent years.

The group has around 300 fighters and is more focused on ransom kidnappings than the global jihadi cause.

In 2000, Abu Sayyaf gunmen crossed the porous maritime border with Malaysia in speedboats and snatched 21 European tourists and Malaysian and Filipino workers from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort and brought them to the southern Philippines, where the captives were later released in exchange for ransom.

Militants in the southern Philippines are holding more than a dozen captives, including two European bird watchers who were seized from Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost Philippines province closest to Sabah, in 2012.
