Cross-channel tensions over David Cameron's plan to claw back powers from Brussels were laid bare today, as French President Francois Hollande said helping the Prime Minister was 'not a priority'.

Mr Hollande said giving the British people a say on leaving the European Union was 'not urgent' and would do little to assist Mr Cameron's push for reform.

The
 cross-Channel spat was being played out as Labour and Lib Dem peers in the House of
 Lords killed off a Bill which would legislate for Mr Cameron's 
referendum.

Awkward: David Cameron and Francois Hollande tried to look relaxed at The Swan Inn barely an hour after they clashed over the need to reform the EU

After tense talks at the summit Prime Minister David Cameron took French President Francois Hollande to The Swan Inn at Swinbrook in Oxfordshire for lunch

During a tense press conference in which 
Mr Hollande was also challenged about his private life, Mr Cameron 
rejected the Frenchman's position, insisting there was 'no doubt' that 
he would renegotiate a new EU relationship before holding an in-out 
referendum by 2017.

It was all smiles as Mr Cameron 
greeted Mr Hollande at the start of an Anglo-French summit but deep 
divisions over Europe and the economy soon emerged.

Mr Holland made clear he has no intention of helping Mr Cameron in his bid to secure a new settlement with the EU through a Treaty change before staging a referendum.

Speaking
 at a press conference after the talks, Mr Hollande said: 'France would 
like the UK to remain within in the EU. France would like to have a more
 effective European which can attain the objectives which we consider to
 be essential: growth, employment, energy and of course the capacity to 
bring in techniques for tomorrow and protect our population.'

But
 he rejected the Mr Cameron's plea for urgent action to renegotiate the 
power Brussels currently wields: 'France would like the Eurozone to be 
better co-ordinated, better integrated. And if there are going to be 
amendments of the text we don’t think for the time being that they are 
urgent.

'We feel that revising the Treaty is not a priority for the time being.'

But Mr Cameron contradicted his 
guest, insisting he would plough on with his plan, which has already 
attrracted the support of Germany's Angela Merkel.

The PM said: 'Europe needs to change and Europe is changing. Just as the Eurozone is changing so Britain wants change in Europe.

‘My
 position absolutely remains that we want to see change, we want to see 
that renegotiation and that will involve elements of treaty change.

'I believe that it will be done and I believe that it will be important for Europe and important for Britain.What
 people really need to know in the United Kingdom is that the in-out 
referendum that I will hold if I am Prime Minister will happen by the 
end of 2017. There cannot be any doubt about it.'

French President Francois Hollande was seen running out of the pub where he met David Cameron for lunch

The Frenchman appeared to want a
 quick getaway after a day which saw him clash with Mr Cameron on Europe
 and face tricky questions about his love life

Labour's
 Europe spokesman Gareth Thomas said: 'Twelve months on from his 
Bloomberg speech, David Cameron's referendum policy is already fraying 
at the seams. His own backbenchers are baying for more, while other EU 
members have dismissed his arbitrary timetable of 2017.

'Europe
 does need to change, but the UK's partners are already ruling out 
treaty change on the arbitrary timetable that David Cameron has set out.

'David
 Cameron's approach to Europe risks leaving the UK more isolated in the 
EU and undermines Britain's ability to secure much-needed reform in 
Europe.'

However Labour faces accusations of being anti-democratic after unelected peers threw out a backbench Bill which would have enshrined a referendum in law.

Peers voted by 180 to 130, majority 50, to end the debate of the EU (Referendum) Bill at committee stage in the Lords.

The debate could resume next week but, with only one sitting Friday left in the Commons, it is now impossible for the Bill to become law.

Tory chief whip in the Lords, Baroness Anelay of St Johns, said: 'Labour killed the Bill. I am disappointed.'

Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron greets France's President Francois Hollande at RAF Brize Norton

The two men have struck deals on energy and defence but are bitterly divided on plans to curb the powers of the European Union

Touchdown: French President Francois Hollande arrives at RAF Brize Norton for the Anglo-French summit hosted by David Cameron

After formal talks on the base 
followed by the press conference the Mr Hollande and Mr Cameron men held a working lunch at The Swan Inn 
in the PM's Witney constituency.

Mr Hollande appeared to enjoy the visit to the boutique Cotswolds gastropub on the banks of the River Windrush, which has featured in Downton Abbey and belongs to the last surviving Mitford sister.

But he was later seen sprinting out of the door to his waiting car. The atmosphere could well have been frosty, with aides to Mr Hollande claiming Britain will have to wait ‘years’ before it is able to rewrite the terms of its membership of the European Union.

It
 has also emerged that the Tories are considering featuring Mr Hollande 
on election posters as the to highlight his close links to Ed Miliband.

A
 senior Tory source has revealed that Mr Hollande was viewed as a 
‘secret weapon’ that would be deployed to drive home the argument that 
Labour cannot be trusted to run the economy.

‘Ed
 Miliband said he wanted to do to Britain what Hollande was doing to 
France,’ the source said. ‘But just look at what Hollande has done - the
 French economy is a basket case and even Hollande is having to talk 
about austerity.'

The International Monetary Fund expects the UK economy to grow by 2.4 per cent this year, more than double the 0.9 per cent forecast for France.

While a surge in jobs has seen unemployment here fall to 7.1 per cent, across the channel it has soared to 11 per cent.

House prices in the year to November were up 3.6 per cent in the UK, compared to a 1.4 per cent fall in France.

Mr Hollande is without a First Lady after revelations he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet.

After it emerged he had travelled to a Paris love nest on a moped, he announced his split from Valerie Trierweiler.

He officially ‘fired’ her on Saturday – signalling the end of her time as  first lady in a curt 18-word statement.

French officials have said it is very unlikely that Mr Hollande will support Mr Cameron's plan to reform the EU before a 2017 referendum in Britain

Mr Cameron and President Hollande will agree further defence 
co-operation on the development of new armed drones.

But ahead of the talks Mr Hollande’s spokesman said it was ‘very, very unlikely’ that any treaty changes will be in place before 2017, when Mr Cameron has pledged an in/out referendum on EU membership.

And he said all the talk of a referendum would frighten investors away from Britain.

In a briefing for journalists in Paris ahead of the summit, the President’s spokesman said any treaty change unlikely before 2017.

‘This doesn’t mean we won’t one day require treaties to be revised for the requirements of economic monetary union, but it is very, very unlikely this will be compatible with the British political calendar,’ he said.

‘It’s in our interests that Britain remains within Europe, but it is not by changing the treaties or rules will negotiate its place in the EU. It is in our interests that Britain remains within Europe but that cannot happen at the price of dismantling Europe.’

The official went on to warn that if the next Government agrees to a referendum, companies will be less willing to invest in the UK as the date for the vote approaches.

He said: ‘The more the question becomes concrete in British national debate, the more investors and the business community warn what a Britain out of Europe would mean.

‘When investors talk, they want to access the European market through the UK. This access presupposes following a certain number of rules to maintain balance in Europe.

‘If these rules are not wanted in the UK, it will no longer have access to [the European market].’

Pub diplomacy: Tony Blair sought to win over French President Jacques Chirac in 2000 with a pint in the County restaurant in the Labour PM's constituency in County Durham ahead of a summit in France

In 2003 Mr Blair repeated the trick, taking US President George W Bush to the Dun Cow pub in his constituency

The two men announced that defence companies from the two countries will carry out a two-year study on building armed drones for their countries’ military.

The ‘entente frugale’ military agreement between France and the UK was first signed in 2010, as the two countries attempted to save money following the credit crunch depression.

They will now go further and will work together on developing a Predator-type drone.

They announced greater cooperation on anti-ship missiles and underwater mine detectors.
