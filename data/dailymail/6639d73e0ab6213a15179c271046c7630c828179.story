Cupid, a young bay mare, was bought by City broker Ranald Laurie in 1911 as a present for his son, Vernon, on his 15th birthday. For the next three years, the teenager spent his days hunting with his beloved horse in the countryside near the family farm in Essex.

But in 1914 war was declared and Ranald, who had recently resigned his position as lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army, enlisted - joining the 271st Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery. 

And that December, just two days after finishing school, Vernon was on active service as second lieutenant. 

Father and son began preparing the family's horses, Cupid, Flashlight, Polly and Nimrod, for battle - readying defences on the English coast in case of a German invasion.

Birthday present: Cupid, pictured with a stable hand, was bought for Vernon Laurie as a gift from his father in 1911. Just three years later, the horse was trained for battle and joined British forces on the Essex coast

It marked the start of a remarkable journey that lasted more than four years and saw the Lauries and their horses travelling thousands of miles to serve on the front line.

Together, the men and their horses faced the horrors of conflict together. They trudged through the muddy fields of France; dragged guns across the Sinai Desert in the sweltering heat; and survived gunfire on the Gaza battlefields. 

Now, through a moving collection of letters sent back and forth from her owner, as well as touching photographs and candid diary entries, Cupid's incredible story has been told for the first time.

In his new book, Cupid's War, Martin Laurie, a retired farmer from Essex, charts how his grandfather, Vernon, and great-grandfather, Randal, travelled from Romford to Beirut with their horses.

The book offers touching insight into the bond between man and beast and sheds light on the lives of millions of courageous animals who fought alongside soldiers in the war.

Mr Laurie said: 'Cupid was one of millions of horses from both sides that went to war. 

Loyal: Two of the Lauries' horses, Cupid and Polly, pictured during their service in the First World War. Their journey is told in a new book that draws on letters, photographs and diary entries from the front line

Posted: Horses are loaded on to a train in England, before they are sent to the front line overseas. The Lauries trudged through the fields of France, pulled guns through the Sinai Desert and dodged bullets in Palestine

Service: A British battleship on the Suez Canal, where the Lauries' and their horses were posted in 1916. The battery, stationed near the Pyramids for months, were ready to fight of a potential Turkish onslaught

And added that 'it is reasonable to suggest that the war could not have been fought' without the horses' 'courage, loyalty and hard work'.

Shortly after war was declared, Lt Col Laurie bought 131 horses to add to the number of family animals. 

They were dispatched to the Essex coast and, after further training, the group sailed from Southampton to France in November 1915.

The horses and the soldiers who met in England would became 'old friends', Mr Laurie writes. The men looked after the horses, trained with them, and nursed them through the horrors of war. 

The Lauries' journey echoes the plot of War Horse, the Michael Morpurgo novel that has been adapted into an award-winning play and film in which a teenager from Devon and his horse, Joey, are both put to use on the Western Front.  

Brutal: Living under the intense heat of the Egyptian sun took its toll on both humans and horses in Cupid's battery, pictured together in April 1916 - three months after they arrived in the country

Vital: Camels were among a number of animals that were vital in helping the British troops survive in Egypt

Action: Cupid's battery saw their first real action of the war when they were stationed in Gaza in 1917. Above, what remains of a tank that was destroyed during a conflict in the Palestinian desert

But while Joey sees the worst of the action in France, the Lauries and their horses escaped the worst of it and were posted to Egypt in January 1916. 

Conditions on the journey across were terrible, and Nimrod was one of several horses to collapse on the second day at sea from lack of water and food. He could not be cajoled to his feet again, and had to be shot.

The battery spent months stationed near the Pyramids - ready to fight of an expected Turkish assault on the Suez Canal.  

There, the young men, who had arrived from a freezing English winter, battled to stay healthy in the intense Egyptian heat. But they were also concerned for the well-being of their horses.

'Old friends': By the time the war ended, those on the horse lines, like the ones pictured above, had become very attached to the animals. The British Government declared that no horses were to return after the war

An extract from the book reads:  'Some of the horses’ noses would also burn and the men would rub a lanolin lotion onto the burns… the men would try anything to keep their horses comfortable.'

The horses were also plagued by flies and Cupid was given a specially-designed fly fringe - another small act to keep him comfortable. 

From Egypt, the battery were given orders to advance on Gaza, where both the men and their horses saw their first major action of the war at the First Battle of Gaza, in March 1917.

At the end of the campaign, only 22 of the 60 horses that Vernon had brought from Essex had survived - and Cupid was one of them.

Caring: Cupid was given a specially-issued fly fringe to help keep her comfortable while serving in Egypt

When war was declared over on 11 November 1918, the men were stationed in Beruit. 

Martin Laurie recreates the scene: 'Ships’ hooters boomed out, bells began to ring and the men began to shout and sing. 

'Up on the hills fires were lit and all sense of army discipline seemed to vanish – news had arrived that an armistice had been signed with Germany …

'The sense of celebration was overwhelming. The men who were at the horse lines stopped their work, and many of the horses were just left to roam about. 

'The men embraced each other, they embraced the horses, they danced jigs and sang songs….the celebrations were to last all night.'

Essential: Horses drag British guns across the Sinai Desert - the only way the weapons could have been moved

But while the surviving men were gradually being demobbed home, the fate of their brave and loyal horses was not decided for some months. 

The Lt Col wrote home: 'One feels marooned up here, no roads or railway to the base, a rotten little harbour which makes it almost impossible to ship horses and guns from here. 

'They will not I am sure ship any of these horses home, if they get them to Egypt they’ll turn them into hides and tallow, if we leave them here we will have to shoot the lot.'

Despite the difficulties, Vernon’s father continued to try and find a way of getting Cupid home, but as time went by this seemed less and less likely.

In February 1919, the Government decided that none of the horses from Egypt would be brought back.

Randal wrote to his son on 24th February 1919: 'I have bad news to tell you, for I have had to destroy poor old Cupid; she had a frightful set to with a wandering mule at night, was horribly mauled, in fact I am not sure she hadn’t a broken leg. 

'She didn’t suffer long; we had 3 vets, & decided to shoot her.'

The Lt Col instructed a veterinary sergeant to clean out Cupid's shoe, which was sent back to Britain and mounted as a brass doorstop, and a 'permanent memory of the little horse', which Mr Laurie still uses today.
