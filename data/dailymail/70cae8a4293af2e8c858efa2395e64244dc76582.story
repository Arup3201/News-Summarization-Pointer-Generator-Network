Sixty nine goals in 110 games, 450 shots, 266 chances created… and not one red card.

Love him or loathe him, Luis Alberto Suarez Díaz, to give him his full name, has had an incredible impact on life in the Premier League since he arrived on these shores in February 2011.

Put aside all his controversies: the biting, the suspension for racist abuse, the diving and the petulance (that is well covered elsewhere on MailOnline), for a brief moment let’s remember his best strikes for Liverpool.

Magician: Luis Suarez's stunning goals and trickery made him a hero at Anfield

10. Sunderland, 20 March 2011

Suarez made an instant impact by coming off the bench to score on debut against Stoke at Anfield, but his first strike away from home was a peach.

After a neat interchange with Dirk Kuyt from a throw-in, Suarez got to the byline and, instead of crossing, lashed the ball in from the tightest of angles.

9. Manchester City, 26 August 2012

In one of Brendan Rodgers' first games in charge of Liverpool, his team dominated Manchester City, but stumbled to a 2-2 draw at Anfield.

After a defensive mix-up allowed Yaya Toure to equalise for City, Suarez responded minutes later with a free-kick that was perfectly placed into the bottom corner beyond the out-stretched hand of Joe Hart.

8. Everton, 28 January 2014

Liverpool simply ripped Everton apart in the Merseyside derby at Anfield with pace and penetration.

With the visitors pushing for a way back into the game, Suarez pounced by winning the ball in his own half and running all the way down the field before slotting past Tim Howard.

7. Cardiff, 21 December 2013

With Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge both injured, Suarez really stepped up in December to keep Liverpool in the title hunt.

His second goal against Cardiff at Anfield was a beautiful first-time strike into the bottom corner on the stroke of half-time. Suarez had already scored one and set up another, and this third goal saw Liverpool top the league at Christmas.

6. Norwich, 4 December 2013

The Uruguayan was simply unplayable in this game. He ended up with four goals and an assist as Liverpool recovered from their 3-1 defeat at Hull by smashing Norwich 5-1 at Anfield.

This was a game I was lucky enough to see live, and I doubt I will see a better hat-trick. His third goal was a venomous strike into the far corner in the 35th minute.

5. Stoke, 26 October 2011

With Liverpool trailing at the Britannia Stadium heading into the second half of this Capital One Cup tie, Suarez came up with a moment of magic to get Kenny Dalglish's side back on track.

Suarez nutmegged Ryan Shotton before curling his right-foot shot into the far corner beyond the helpless Thomas Sorensen.

The Uruguayan would go on to score an 85th-minute winner, and Liverpool went on to win the Capital One Cup at Wembley.

4. West Brom, 26 October 2013

Another of the many games where Suarez was simply unplayable. He finished with a hat-trick in this game, the second goal of which was a header into the top corner from the edge of the penalty area.

This came five minutes after his first goal, where he jinked his way through three defenders before firing into the bottom corner.

Rising high: Suarez scored a hat-trick in a 4-1 win over West Brom at Anfield in October

3. Newcastle, 4 November 2012

Liverpool were struggling to create chances against a stubborn Newcastle team, who were protecting a 1-0 lead at Anfield.

But, in the 67th minute, Suarez stole half a yard on the Newcastle defence and controlled Jose Enrique's long ball on his shoulder, before rounding Tim Krul and tapping in.

2. Norwich, 4 December 2013

Another goal from that hat-trick I saw live, and this one I was right behind the line of.

It was a fairly uneventful first 15 minutes, but one moment of magic changed that. After John Ruddy's goal-kick bounced around in midfield, Suarez ran onto the ball and hit a first-time shot from 40 yards over the goalkeeper's head.

1. Norwich, 28 April 2012

There are few sights that Suarez enjoyed more than seeing Norwich on the other side of the scoreboard. He simply came alive against them, and his hat-trick at Carrow Road at the end of the 2011-12 season was rounded off with a sublime finish from the halfway line.

There were many contenders for the No 1 spot, but the technique, vision, execution for this goal makes it the best.
