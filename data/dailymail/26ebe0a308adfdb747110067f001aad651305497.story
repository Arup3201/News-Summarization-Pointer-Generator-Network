A Texas inmate set to be executed next week for fatally shooting four men at an airplane hangar more than 30 years ago won a reprieve Thursday from the U.S. Supreme Court.

Lester Bower Jr., 67, among the longest-serving Texas death row inmates, had been scheduled for lethal injection Tuesday. The justices gave no reason for the reprieve, saying only that it would be lifted automatically if they deny an appeal or act on it.

Bower was convicted in the October 1983 deaths at a Grayson County ranch about 60 miles north of Dallas. Authorities found parts from a small ultralight airplane at the hangar at his home in Arlington, a Dallas suburb.

Prosecutors also tied unusual Italian-made .22-caliber bullets used in the slayings to similar ammunition purchased by Bower, a federally licensed gun dealer.

Temporary reprieve: Lester Bower, 67, speaks on a phone in an interview cage at the visiting area of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Polunsky Unit near Livingston, Texas. Bower, set to be executed next week for fatally shooting four men at an airplane hangar more than 30 years ago, won a reprieve Thursday from the U.S. Supreme Court

He asked for a delay so the Supreme Court could consider his appeal, which is pending at the court. The next time the nine justices are scheduled to meet to discuss new cases to take up is February 20. 

In their appeal to the high court, Bower's lawyers said jurors who decided on his death sentence had faulty instructions that didn't allow them to consider mitigating circumstances that he had no criminal record, was a married father of two, college educated and employed as a chemical salesman.

Since his 1984 trial, court rulings have refined instructions to Texas capital murder trial juries to account for mitigating circumstances. Several condemned inmates from that era — but not Bower — have received new court-ordered punishment trials.

Bower's attorneys also contended that prosecutors misstated the rarity of the fatal bullets, and that his long time on death row and numerous rescheduled execution dates amount to unconstitutional suffering.

State attorneys argued that courts have rejected appeals about the jury instructions, that information about the bullets was available at the time of his trial and that Bower's lawyers' persistent appeals account for the lengthy case.

Among the legal questions that Bower has raised is whether the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment has been violated by his more than 30-year stay on death row. 

'Any delay is purely of his own making,' Stephen Hoffman, an assistant Texas attorney general, told the justices in a filing this week.

Ominous evidence: Trial evidence that was used in case against Lester Leroy Bower Jr., is shown in the Grayson County District Clerk's office Wednesday in Sherman, Texas. Three months after four bodies were found shot execution-style in an airplane hangar on the B&B Ranch north of Dallas, Bower, a chemical salesman, was charged with capital murder

A jury deliberated just two hours before convicting Lester Bower, then deliberated only two hours more the following day before deciding he should die for the crime.

No fingerprints put him at the scene. No witnesses saw him there. The murder weapon never was found. Bower never confessed. DNA testing wasn't available then.

Bower made them suspicious. He had lied to his wife and to authorities about his efforts to buy an ultralight plane; she didn't want him flying such a flimsy craft. He sold firearms on the side, including the kind that fired the ammunition used to kill the men.

Convicted in 1984: Seen here in his younger days, Bower has now been on death row longer than nearly any other Texas inmate

'I was quite capable of purchasing whatever I need without killing four people,' Bower said in 2008 after a state judge stopped stopped his execution scheduled that summer. 'Virtually no one, except for the prosecution, thinks this sounds like anything I would do.'

Bower says he had a good job and was a family man, father of two daughters, with a stable marriage.

'An absolutely stellar record,' Bower said. 'Then one day, as the prosecutor says, I snapped, killed four people and snapped back. Those are his words, not mine.

'I'm not minimizing that people don't snap ... Does this really sound like something I would do?'

Yes, prosecutors insist.

Sievert and Grayson County prosecutors built a circumstantial case surrounding Bower's purchase of the ultralight airplane from sheriff's Deputy Philip Good, 29. The aircraft was stored at a hangar owned by building contractor Bob Tate, 51.

Tate; Good; Jerry Brown, 52, a Sherman interior designer; and Ronald Mayes, 39, a former Sherman police officer, were all killed at the hangar.

Bower acknowledges he lied to the FBI about his involvement in the purchase of the plane.

He said Brown was with Good that Saturday afternoon when he was negotiating the down payment of $3,000, or 75 percent, on the airplane. They all waited about 15 minutes for Tate to show up with a key to the hangar.

Bower said he never saw Mayes.

Evidence at trial centered on Bower's two purchases in 1982, when he lived in Colorado Springs, Colo., of Italian-made Fiocchi-brand .22-caliber ammunition, the kind used in the killings. There also was evidence he had owned a .22-caliber Ruger pistol, which prosecutors said was fitted with a silencer he made.

Bower had a federal firearms dealer license. Prosecutors showed jurors his books about guns and gun parts, a Ruger target pistol manual and a book about silencers.

Among evidence and trial exhibits still stored in cardboard boxes at the courthouse are four plastic foam heads, the kind used to display wigs. These four, however, have long blue knitting needles stuck in them, representing the paths bullets took to kill each person.

Was it enough? Among the evidence used by the prosecution was the type of bullets used in 1983 killings, an Italian-made .22 caliber that Bower's defenders now say prosecutors unfairly characterized as rare after offering evidence he'd purchased such bullets the year before

LESTER LEROY BOWER, JR. v. STATE OF TEXAS

Prosecutors said Bower was obsessed with the aircraft and stole it. Bower has said he was at the hangar to purchase the aircraft and the men were alive when he left.

Those killed were building contractor Bob Tate, 51; Grayson County Sheriff's Deputy Philip Good, 29; Jerry Brown, 52, an interior designer; and Ronald Mayes, 39, a former Sherman police officer.

Good's wife, Marlene Bushard, said the delay was 'very frustrating since we were so close.'

'I am hoping once this is done he will be out of options, we can get another death warrant and end this,' she said in an email.

Police looking through her slain husband's phone records spotted several calls from Bower, and he lied to investigators when they contacted him.

'Not cooperating with authorities was the biggest mistake,' Bower told The Associated Press last month. 'And I paid for it with my life. A lot of us have done some crazy things.'

He insisted the presence of the disassembled aircraft at his house should not be incriminating.

'They can't prove it was stolen and I can't prove I bought it,' he said. 'They have four dead men. It's too good a story, so they say I stole it.'

Second chance sentencing? Since his 1984 trial, court rulings have refined instructions to Texas capital murder trial juries to account for mitigating circumstances. Several condemned inmates from that era — but not Bower — have received new court-ordered punishment trials
