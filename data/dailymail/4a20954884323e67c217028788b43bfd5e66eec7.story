Daniel Libeskind led a memorial lecture marking the 20th anniversary of the death of Stephen Lawrence last night.

Mr Libeskind, who designed Manchester’s Imperial War Museum North, was chosen to speak at the event in memory of budding architect Stephen, who was killed in a racist attack aged 18 in 1993.

The Polish-born architect made a speech, entitled ‘Architecture and Memory’, at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.

Mr Libeskind said: ‘I was honored to give the Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture this year. Clearly, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and prejudices of all sorts are unacceptable in a democracy.

‘Forging a better future means fighting against the intrusions of these evils into society. Building a city of the future does not only involve building in concrete, steel and glass – but involves building a better civic society.’

Mr Libeskind designed the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the Military History Museum in Dresden; and faced off strong competition in his bid to reconstruct the World Trade Centre site.

In his speech Daniel Libeskind said: 'Building a city of the future does not only involve building in concrete, steel and glass ¿ but involves building a better civic society.¿

The lecture was the thirteenth of its kind to be held by the Trust, which aims to provide access and opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, especially minority ethnic and white working class young people.

Previous speakers have included Prince Charles as well as Professor Chris Wise who designed the Olympic velodrome and RIBA Stirling Prize winning architect Zaha Hadid.

The Trust awards bursaries to disadvantaged young people and has so far helped nine people to qualify as architects. It is seeking to expand to improve access to other professions such as law, finance and the media.

Symon Sentain, Chair of the Stephen Lawrence Trust, said: ‘We were delighted to welcome Daniel Libeskind as our keynote speaker this year.

‘He is an inspiration to the young architects supported by the Trust’s bursary scheme. We continue our work to improve access to the professions in careers including architecture, law, banking and media. Our aim is to build hope for the future.’
