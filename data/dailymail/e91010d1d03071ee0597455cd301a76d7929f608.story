Someone, somewhere, must be looking out for them.

Their screams filling the air, religious pilgrims plunge ceremonial daggers into their necks and chests - and draw not a drop of blood.

These stunning images show a sacred ritual more than 100 years old at the Temple of Petilan Pengerebongan in Bali, Indonesia.

Gruesome: Devotees at the temple of Petilan Pengerebongan in Bali, Indonesia, stab themselves in the neck without drawing blood in a traditional ceremony. They say they are protected by invoking a state of trance

Outer-body experience: The ceremony is known as Ngerebong and happens every 210 days, the length of a year in the Balinese calendar. People stab themselves with a dagger called a keris to unite with nature and God

Tradition: The daggers are made of iron, nickel and steel and are thought to have originated in the 10th century

The royal temple near the Balinese capital Denpasar played host to the ritual today, as it does every 210 days - the length of a traditional Balinese year.

It is known as Ngerebong and is one of the most well-known religious ceremonies in the world.

Worshippers in the deeply religious village of Kesiman gather for a day-long communion between the Hindu gods, nature and humankind.

They start with rituals to summon Hindu spirits back to Earth, escalating until they work themselves into a mass trance.

Devotees dressed in elaborate costumes of mythological beasts, complete with hair and wild eyes, gather around villagers dressed all in white with white headdresses. 

Residents of the tiny village have wild looks in their eyes as the religious ceremony reaches its climax

Communion: The ritual not only brings villagers closer to God, it also helps give them a sense of community

Pain: Young members of the community struggle under the weight of their companions as they enter a trance

As the ceremony reaches its peak, individual men start to thrash and scream and they stab themselves with their keris daggers.

A traditional gamelan orchestra plays faster and faster, and women join the throng, shutting their eyes and moving as if on an otherworldly dance floor.

The spectacle attracts tourists and photographers from around the world. The images below were captured by the award-winning Indonesian photographer Agung Parameswara.

The ritual is said to date back to the 19th Century when it began under the reign of Pengerebongan, the first ruler of the village.

It is said he invited all his subjects together to pay tribute to the gods together. To this day, the festival is held on the anniversary of the royal temple.

Otherwordly: Some of those in the ritual don huge, flamboyant masks, which help them invoke the spirits

Young women caught in a trance look almost as if they are dancing. The practice dates to the 19th century

Denpasar, Bali, has not escaped the 21st century - just like in Britain, if people are given something interesting to watch, a host of them will start filming it on their mobile phone. Only one man gives the camera a wary gaze
