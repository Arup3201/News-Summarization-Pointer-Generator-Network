A 11-year-old boy died when a police chase went wrong and he was hit by a stolen car that was involved in a police chase.

Donovan Turnage, was killed instantly when the car he was in was hit but his brother Derrick, 20, and his father both survived.

The alleged driver of the stolen car was Rockie Douglas, 34, according to police who have launched an appeal to any witnesses.

The family had been on their way to 
get a hair cut in time for Christmas celebrations when the terrifying hit and run happened at the corner of 55th and Halsted, Chicago, Illinois.

Mr Turnage told DNAinfo Chicago: 'He was a joyful, playful, goofy kid.

'He 
was a gamehead... he said he wanted to make his own video games, be a 
graphic designer... he was into anything to do with technology. Nobody 
knew it unless you knew him.'

Wanted: Rockie Douglas, pictured, has been identified as the hit and run carjacker

Describing the horrifying moment he saw the stolen car careering towards him, he added: 'It hit our car so hard. Like it was going 100 miles an hour.'

Speaking from his family's
 home in Chicago Lawn, he said he did not think his brother suffered 
during the impact which threw his body from his seat.

Wanted Douglas is suspected in three 
carjackings over the weekend, as well as a number of robberies and other
 crimes in Chicago and Wisconsin, police said.

The
 1998 Dodge Caravan van had been stolen Friday morning from the 800 
block of West Irving Park Road in Buena Park, police said.

A chase ensued Saturday 
morning when the van was reported spotted near where it later crashed at
 about 12:30 p.m., killing Donovan, according to Officer Daniel O'Brien,
 a police spokesman.

The
 stolen van slammed into the left side of the family's Chevrolet 
Suburban, at the intersection of 55th and Halsted streets, after 
officers tried to curb it during the chase.

It is claimed Douglas managed to flee the scene and later hijacked another car at gun point.

The Chicago Police Department is working 
with the Illinois State Police, as well as federal and local agencies to
 find Douglas, who is described as 6-feet-3 and 275lbs.
