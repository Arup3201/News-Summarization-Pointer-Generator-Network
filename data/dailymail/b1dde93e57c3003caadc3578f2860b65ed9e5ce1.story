A bus driver in Croatia is facing the sack after he was caught using two mobile phones to text friends while driving at around 80mph.

He is said to have told passengers to 'get lost' when they complained about how dangerous his actions were.

Passengers on the bus - travelling between the southern town of Split to the capital Zagreb - claim he said he had to tell friends that he had been 'stuck in traffic'.

One, Zlatko Kralj,  said: 'I could not believe what he was doing but he didn't care.

'He was typing SMS messages on two mobile phones at the same time while driving with his elbows at 130 km/h.

'We said you’re mad and he said he needed to just send the message, and carried on.'

The owner of the bus company, Promet Makarska, told daily newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija the driver will now be sacked.

Mate Jujnovic, the owner of Promet Makarska, said: 'There is no excuse, we are now preparing his papers, nothing can save him from getting sacked.'

The bus was travelling from the southern town of Split to the capital Zagreb and the driver said he wanted to tell pals he was running late after being caught in a jam.

Another passenger said: 'He should have sent them when he was in the jam, not wait until he was on the road again.'
