A super slimmer has revealed the secret of her great British weight-off: baking rich, gooey cakes... but just enjoying the smell of them.

Sweet-toothed Lynne Gadd, 36, from Pontypridd, South Wales, tipped the scales at almost 17 stone because of her love of cakes and pastries.

She steadily ballooned to a dress size 22 by baking every variety of cake for herself and friends to enjoy, but she has successfully dropped 10 dress sizes by exercising self-control and enjoying just the smell of her creations rather than the taste.

Lynne said: 'My friends and family loved my cakes and I'd get requests to make wedding cakes and birthday cakes all the time.

'I loved making them so much but I couldn't stop eating them as well as making them.

'All I could do was watch as my waistline got bigger and bigger.

'But now I have discovered a way of getting my daily sweet fix without actually tucking in.'

After a health scare she knew she had to lose weight - but didn't want to give up her home baking.

So Lynne carried on cooking - and became satisfied just by the smell of the ingredients.

She could even resist a slice of one of her hot cakes as it came out of the oven.

Lynne loved making cakes so much... but she also loved eating them, and watched her waistline swell

Lynne said: 'My friends and family said I would never lose the weight if I started making more cakes. I wouldn't be able to resist eating them.

'But I trained myself to enjoy the sweet aromas of the cake without tucking in.

'Now I've joined Slimming World, switched to a healthy diet and carried on baking more than ever.'

Mother-of-two Lynne hit her target weight of 10st 12lb and is now a svelte size 12.

She said: 'I laugh about it but its true - I really did bake myself slimmer.'

She since starting a cake baking business from home and avoids the temptation of eating on the job

She continued: The aroma of those cakes cooking really did help me to lose all the weight.

'I've lost almost seven stone baking cakes, and when I tell people my story it shocks them. They wonder how I couldn't be tempted to eat all the cakes.

'But, honestly, the sight of all the sugar and chocolate and the lovely aroma of them baking in the oven was enough.

'Now my kids tell me I have lost my big bum and I'm very pleased about that.'

Lynne has also turned her love of home baking into a full-time job.

She said: 'My cakes are so popular now that I've started a business called Lucky Girl Cakes.

'I make every sort of cake you can imagine - from cupcake bouquets to sparkly ruby slippers.

'Of course, I still love the odd slice of cake, but now I know when it's time to stop scoffing.

'I'm living proof that you can have your cake and eat it - just a little bit!'

And Lynne's unusual weight-loss has scientific backing.

A team at the Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands found that people take smaller bites of food when it's accompanied by stronger aromas.
