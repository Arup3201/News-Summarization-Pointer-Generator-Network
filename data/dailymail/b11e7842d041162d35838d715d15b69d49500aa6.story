It is the moment a great white shark latches on to a buoy and refuses to let go.

Passengers on a boat in South Africa managed to capture amazing footage of the terrifying shark grabbing hold of a flotation device.

As the fisherman on board tries to pull the buoy in, the shark can be seen battling to maintain its vice-like grip - in much the same way a dog would with a toy.

As the shark becomes more frustrated, fling the buoy from side to side in a bid to keep hold of it, the onlookers on the boat can be heard laughing.

In fact, the shark is so busy swing its head from side to side, it almost headbutts a cage hanging off the side of the boat, which is used by scuba divers.

The footage was filmed in Mossel Bay, an area known for its shark diving along South Africa’s attractive Garden Route.

The frustrated great white shows immense force as it fling around the bait, before eventually giving up and sliding back into the water and out of view.

Scientists discovered in 2008 that the bite force of a great white can reach 1.8 tons, which is 20 times greater than a human's bite. 

Cage diving with great whites is a popular pastime for holidaymakers on the South African coast, with one session costing around £100.

Firm grip: When the shark bites down on the buoy it holds it in its mouth in a powerful grip

Incisive: The shark moves the buoy around in his mouth as he bites down on the object and onlookers watch on
