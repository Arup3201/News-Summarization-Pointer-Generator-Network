Across the world, people are crammed around their television sets, eagerly watching the $42million spectacular of London’s Opening Ceremonies.

But those watching stateside will be forced to wait until 7:30pm EST, when NBC will broadcast the show, three and a half hours from the actual start of the ceremony, adjusted for time differences.

The network, which has sole rights to broadcasting the Olympics in America, has chosen to delay their broadcast to the chagrin of viewers hoping to catch a live glance of the elaborate ceremonies.

Delayed: The live broadcast of the Opening Ceremonies in London are being held by NBC, and will be broadcast instead at 7:30pm EST tonight; here, the performance has already started

Further, they chose not to stream the events online, the Wall Street Journal said.

This means that those wanting to watch on the West Coast must wait a full six and a half hours before seeing the commencement of the 2012 Olympic Games.

Journalist and former TV critic Jeff Jarvis was among many who voiced their anger over the delay in the games. Mr Jarvis tweeted: 'Without NBC live streaming of the Olympics opening ceremonies, I'll have to rely on Mitt Romney's tweets.'

Mr Romney has been doing damage control after questioning if Britain was capable of handling the Olympics. The presidential candidate has been on a high-profile tour of the country, and is attending the night's ceremonies.

NBC, which has owned the American broadcasting rights to the Summer Olympic games since 1988, most likely held the broadcast so it would hit square in prime time. Advertisers pay more for time slots in such programming.

According to Ad Week, NBC purchased the rights to the Olympics from 2014-2020 for a staggering $4.38billion.

They were awarded the right by the International Olympic Committee.

The site said that NBC lost $223million in its broadcast of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic games, and is slated to lose even more in the London broadcast.

Isolation: This Twitter user (hyperbolicly) said he would turn off every form of social media ahead of tonight's delayed events

Tony Metcalf, the Editor-in-chief of New York City paper Metro called NBC’s actions a ‘clueless, arrogant disgrace.’

The jilted editor wrote in an editorial that he and his staffers had planned an office party, complete with drinks and pizza. When he realised that the pizza orders had to be cancelled, he wrote: ‘America's reputation at the Games has already taken a hit thanks to the brainless gibbering of Mitt Romney in the last few days.’

He continued: ‘And the notion that the NBC's audience figures are more important than the Olympic Games just supports stereotypes that Americans are insular, arrogant and could not care less of about anything that happens beyond the country's borders. I know they are not.’

Today show host Matt Lauer, along with 
the rest of the popular morning show, have been broadcasting live from 
the English capital and will continue their broadcast from London’s 
Olympic Park for the duration of the two-week games.

NBC affiliates like NBC Sports, NBC News, and CNBC will all broadcast events.

NBC earlier told the New York Times’ Media Decoder that it has collected $1billion in Olympics advertising, including digital and cross-platform adverts.

Included in that are apps for mobile and tablet devices, and a 3-D channel.  A full list of tomorrow's events may be seen here.

Britain opened its Olympics with a royal entrance like no other.

London greeted the world in a celebration of Old England that was stunning, imaginative, whimsical and dramatic - and cheeky - even featuring a stand-in for Queen Elizabeth II parachuting into Olympic Stadium.

Moments later, the 86-year-old monarch herself stood solemnly while a children's choir serenaded her with 'God Save the Queen,' and members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force raised the Union Jack.

Fighter jets streaming red, white and blue smoke roared over the stadium, packed with a buzzing crowd of 60,000 people, at 8:12 p.m. - or 20:12 in the 24-hour time observed by Britons.

An explosion of fireworks against the London skyline and Paul McCartney leading a singalong were to wrap up the three-hour show masterminded by one of Britain's most successful filmmakers, Oscar winner Danny Boyle.

He led off his spectacular in his favoured medium, with a high-speed flyover of the Thames, the river that slices like a vein through London and was the gateway for the city's rise over the centuries as a great global hub of trade and industry.

The rush of images showed a cricket match, the London Tube and the roaring, abundant seas that buffet and protect this island nation - set to a pulsating soundtrack including snippets of the Sex Pistols' more irreverent cover of 'God Save the Queen.'

To open the ceremony, children popped balloons with each number from 10 to 1, leading a countdown that climaxed with Bradley Wiggins, the newly crowned Tour de France champion. Wearing his race-winner's yellow jersey, Wiggins rang a 23-ton Olympic Bell from the same London foundry that made Big Ben and Philadelphia's Liberty Bell.

Its thunderous chime echoed around the 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium. Bells in Britain have traditionally pealed to celebrate the end of war and the crowning of kings and queens, and now for the opening of a 17-day festival of sports.

The show then shifted to a portrayal of Britain that Britons cling to - a place of meadows, farms, sport on village greens, picnics and Winnie-the-Pooh, A.A. Milne's fictional bear who has delighted generations of British children tucked warmly in bed.

But the British ideal - to quote poet William Blake, of 'England's green and pleasant land' - then took a darker, grittier turn.

The set was literally torn asunder, the hedgerows and farm fences carried away, as Boyle shifted to the industrial transformation that revolutionized Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, the foundation for an empire that reshaped world history. Belching chimneys rose where only moments earlier sheep had trod.

The Industrial Revolution also produced terrifying weapons, and Boyle built a moment of hush into his show to honour those killed in war.

'This is not specific to a country; this is across all countries, and the fallen from all countries are celebrated and remembered,' he explained to reporters ahead of the ceremony.

'Because, obviously, one of the penalties of this incredible force of change that happened in a hundred years was the industrialization of war, and the fallen,' he said. 'You know, millions fell.'

Olympic organizers separately rejected calls for a moment of silence for 11 Israeli athletes and coaches slain by Palestinian gunmen at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Two of the Israelis' widows appealed to audience members to stand in silence when International Olympic Committee chief Jacques Rogge rises to speak later at Friday's ceremony. The Israeli culture and sport minister planned to do just that.

Since then, 8,000 torchbearers, mostly unheralded Britons, have carried the flame on a 70-day, 8,000-mile journey from toe to tip of the British Isles, whipping up enthusiasm for a $14 billion Olympics taking place during a severe recession.

The identity of the last torchbearer, the one to light the cauldron, was kept secret - remarkable given the intense scrutiny at what have been called the first social media Olympics.

Speculation focused on Roger Bannister, the first man to run a four-minute mile, in 1954, and on rower Steve Redgrave, among others.

Boyle's $42 million show, with 15,000 volunteers, promised to take the expected global television audience of 1 billion on a rich and textured journey through British history.

In the center of the stadium, where athletes like Usain Bolt will star in the coming weeks, Boyle constructed a giant set portraying a romanticized vision of a green and pleasant Britain.

Smoke wisped from the crooked chimneys of a homely thatched cottage. Meadows of perky pink flowers, spreads of real grass, fake fluffy clouds and live animals - including 40 cream-colored sheep - transported spectators from the East End of London to a rural idyll so dear to English hearts.

That was later to give way to darker, grittier segments dwelling on the industrial might upon which Britain built a global empire and shaped world history.

Full house: Thousands of spectators - an estimated 60,000 - take their seats ahead of the ceremony

Boyle's challenge was daunting: To be as memorable as Beijing's incredible, money-no-object opening ceremony of 2008.

He drew from Shakespeare, British pop culture, literature and music, and other sources of inspiration that will speak to - but perhaps at times baffle - not just Anglophiles but people across the globe.

One segment featured the actor Daniel Craig as James Bond, and former Beatle Paul McCartney was to lead a sing-along.

For Jacques Rogge, it was his last time as president of the International Olympic Committee to watch the Olympic flag being raised at an opening ceremony. He will step down in 2013 after completing the maximum two terms.

Besides the thousands of athletes and performers, 60,000 spectators were expected to pack Olympic Stadium. Political leaders from around the world, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters, and a sprinkling of European and celebrity royalty were also attending.
