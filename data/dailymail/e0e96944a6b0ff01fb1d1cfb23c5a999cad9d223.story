Financial pain: Ryanair has revealed a £28m loss in the last three months of 2013 - at a time where its boss Michael O'Leary promised to stop 'p****** off' passengers

Ryanair has recorded a £28.7million loss in the last three months of 2013 despite its controversial boss promising to stop 'p****** off' its customers.

The Irish airline, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, issued its first profit warnings in a decade last year on the back of weak winter bookings.

The carrier said today it lost £28.7million (35million euros) in the three months to December 31, its worst performance in its traditionally weak third quarter since 2008.

Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said the loss was due to lower average fares and weaker sterling.

This is its worst end of year results since 2008, and the airline has already promised to bring in allocated seating after years of complaints.

From this month travellers can pay five 
euros - £4.23 - to choose their seat while the rest will be allocated in
 the 24 hours prior to departure.

It remains on course for profits of around £420 million (510million euros) in the year to March 31.

'Market pricing remains soft but is no longer declining,' Mr O'Leary said.

The flamboyant tycoon, 52, decided last November to
 remove himself from the public eye in a bid to 'stop unnecessarily 
p****** people off', adding: 'I'm getting in the way'.

Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years.

The budget airline - which has been criticised for treating its 
passengers 'like the enemy' - has recently been forced to issue its 
second profits warning in two months.

Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a 
reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for 
almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary 
growth

Pay-per-pee

In 2009, Mr O’Leary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight.

'We’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny,' he told the BBC Breakfast show.

When asked if he would charge more than a pound, he replied: 'If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver.'Vertical seats

A year later, the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats, akin to bar stools with seatbelts.

His theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats, flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent.

Reservation charge

Ryanair has announced it will begin to allocate seats from next year - but it will still cost almost £5 if you want to choose it yourself.

From February travellers can pay five euros - £4.23 - to choose their seat while the rest will be allocated in the 24 hours prior to departure.

Who needs co-pilots?

Mr O'Leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to 'make sure the first fella doesn’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls'.

He declared aviation authorities should axe the 'unnecessary' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as 'back-up' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight.

Over the autumn the outspoken tycoon 
was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer 
session from customers.

He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets.

Many
 customers told Mr O'Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was - with
 user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired 
British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'.

The
 Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more 
accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still 
love me.'

Mr O'Leary also claimed he was a 'Neanderthal' who 
believed men should not feel any pressure to help bring up their own 
children.

He also compared himself to Jesus and insisted Ryanair only punishes customers who fail to comply with its rules.

Only
 ten days earlier, he had declared that a passenger who complained at 
being charged to print out a new boarding pass was 'stupid'.

But he has since promised to end his airline's 'over-abrupt' culture.

He has said strict hand-luggage 
restrictions would be relaxed to allow ‘small ladies’ handbags’ and 
airport shopping to be carried onto the plane in addition to the stated 
allowance.

Mr O’Leary 
also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine 
mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often 
results in a £70 charge to reprint them.

He said that Ryanair was ‘evolving’ and becoming more ‘sophisticated’.

He added: ‘In the past we have said, “That’s the policy – go to hell”. That culture needs  to evolve.’

EasyJet has been growing its revenues when compared to its rival.

Anger: Some Twitter users took the opportunity to vent their frustrations about the company

Ryanair flew six per cent more passengers in the last three months of 2013 compared with a year earlier, but revenue was flat due to the fall in ticket prices.

British rival easyJet by comparison increased revenue 7.7 percent on passenger numbers growth of 4.2 percent in the same period.

It has been being voted the worst of the 100 biggest brands serving the British market by readers of consumer magazine Which?.

Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said the changes had not yet had an impact on profit, but that there signs the strategy was starting to bear fruit.

'There has been a very positive reaction ... particularly in terms of forward bookings which we have never had as substantially ahead,' he said.
