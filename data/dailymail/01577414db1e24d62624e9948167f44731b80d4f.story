After the wettest January for more than 100 years, we're all desperately looking forward to any sign that spring is on its way. One of the earliest heralds is the snowdrop.

And since the beginning of February, gardeners with land not swamped by floodwater will have been looking out for the first shoots nervously peeping their heads above soil.

But gardeners have another reason to feel protective and anxious about their flowers this year. Snowdrop collecting has seen a boom in Britain over the last few years, with sales reaching many hundreds of pounds for just one bulb.

Flower power: Steve Owen is spending
£1,000 to protect his snowdrops

The most expensive is a variety called Galanthus Elizabeth Harrison: just one bulb went for £725 last February. Clearly, this is not a poor man’s hobby - and that's the problem.

Thieves have seized upon the desirability of some of the rarest bulbs and are stealing them from verges, private gardens and public parks in worrying numbers.

Now, the gardeners are fighting back with a range of measures to try to deter even the most determined thief.

Some are even installing anti-theft devices worth thousands of pounds to protect their precious plants.

No one can deny snowdrops are beautiful. On a walk in the pouring rain through Sir Harold Hillier Gardens near Romsey in Hampshire, they take your breath away. Carpets of them grow in the Winter Garden, yet only two are labelled.

This is deliberate, says head gardener, Fran Clifton. Back in 2008, she planted out two pots of Galanthus Blewberry Tart, a rare variety that then cost £25 per bulb.

'Both clumps went missing. One day they were just gone,' she says. 'But the problems really started in the winter of 2011/12. We planted out a few rather rare snowdrops from a private collection and within a few weeks we noticed that some had gone missing.

'We got some more and we’ve planted them in subterranean cages so you can’t just dig them up. We do that with all our rare varieties now and we don’t label them.'

Expensive: Galanthus Elizabeth Harrison is worth £725 a bulb

The gardens have 60 of the world’s 2,000 varieties of snowdrop in a 180-acre site. Over the past two years, however, to stop thieves stealing the rarer plants they have been removed from the grounds and rehoused in pots in locked greenhouses.

The public's only glimpse of them is at an annual, two-week snowdrop exhibition in the main house. This spring some 40 varieties are on view to snowdrop enthusiasts - known as galanthophiles - from the diminutive Tiny Tim to the foot-tall Mrs W. M. George, named after the wife of Hillier's former head gardener.

Two wardens patrol the room at all times to enforce a strict 'no touching' rule. Plants can be inspected only with the use of mirrors, which are provided. So far, fingers crossed, nothing has been taken.

'I think it's very sad,' says warden Jean Snowsill. 'They would all look beautiful in their natural habitat. They are so lovely. They make you think that spring is on its way.'

But this simply isn't possible: after the exhibition, which ends this Sunday, the rare varieties are returned to their greenhouses, the doors locked and alarms set.

'It's just awful,' says Fran. 'It's very disappointing that this has happened and that we have to protect plants in this manner.

'I can understand that the bulbs are expensive, but you can just buy the cheap ones. You don’t have to buy the expensive ones. It’s like a mania for people.'

'Steve Owen owns, grows and maintains the National Collection of snowdrops in his back garden in a hidden corner of Bedfordshire.

Here, over the last ten years, he has amassed the largest collection in the world, numbering some  900 varieties.

'It looks wonderful at the moment,' he says. 'There are snowdrops flowering everywhere. It's great.'

But only Steve, his wife and perhaps a few select friends will see his stunning spring display this year.

The reason is that Steve, too, has fallen prey to a snowdrop thief over the last two years.

'We usually make the gardens available for people to visit, to open up the collection,' he explains.

'We got lots of visitors the first time we opened in 2012. People brought cameras and took lots of pictures. Clearly, they marked where things were and came back under cover of darkness.'

A few weeks after Steve’s open day he discovered that a variety named E. A. Bowles, which was only discovered in 2004 and was consequently very rare, had been dug up.

'It was a particularly valuable variety,' he says. 'That theft alone cost me £900. It's not about the money; you don't look at your garden in terms of monetary value. But it did make me sad.'

Last year, the same thing happened. He held an open day, and a few weeks' later discovered another two valuable varieties had been stolen. 'They just walked in the front gate when I was in bed and took them,' he says.

'I don't know who's doing it, but it suggests it's being done by people who know their snowdrops.'

Steve didn't report either theft to the police, but this year his prized garden is closed to the public while he installs security measures to protect his plants.

Four CCTV cameras and night-time anti-theft lights are being put in at the cost of £1,000.

'It's quite annoying, but I have to keep them safe,' he says.

Joe Sharman, proprietor of Monksilver Nursery in Cambridgeshire, is known as The Snowdrop Pope and sells them across Europe.

The rarest do not have a price. He simply accepts bids for them.

This is his busiest period of the year, often working until 1am to package and send out plants 'in the green' (snowdrops are traditionally sold in leaf as they tend to not prosper as well when planted as bulbs).

'I think it's someone who’s doing this to stock their own garden,' he says. The plants are so rare no one has them for sale.

'The thief keeps incredibly good records of what's growing where. They know what's in each pot and where it is,' he adds.

So far, he's not had any thefts, but is cautious about revealing the location of his nursery, where, he says, there are ‘people patrolling the whole time’ to protect the bulbs.

Beautiful sight: But many displays are being ruined thanks to thieves

When attending special snowdrop events, he employs security staff to protect his wares.

'Now the 'mania' for snowdrops seems to be spreading beyond the inner circle of galanthophiles to the general public.

Andrew Turvey is head gardener at Myddelton House Gardens on the outskirts of North London. The gardens have drifts of snowdrops in woodland and attract up to 55,000 visitors per year.

They have experienced so many thefts - not just of snowdrops - that they have now installed a 600m-long, 2m-high metal security fence, costing £25,000. 'It was necessary to do it,' says Andrew, 'otherwise people could just have hopped over a four-foot wall into our snowdrop area and taken them.'

And it's not just public gardens that are being targeted.

Online gardening forums are abuzz with people lamenting thefts from their flowerbeds. Such is the paranoia that all of them hide behind pseudonyms and refuse to speak publicly about their losses, for fear of being hit again.

Bulbs are disappearing from roadsides and parks too. On March 22 last year, Jill Eveleigh wrote to her local newspaper, the Kingston Guardian, saying that snowdrops had been stolen from Morden recreation ground in South London.

'It has upset me greatly,' she said. 'I, and no doubt countless others, have enjoyed for many years the snowdrops that come up and flower for weeks, and grow when nothing else is able to.'

Back at Hillier Gardens, I walk back to my car through the Winter Gardens. Under a hornbeam tree there is a vast carpet of purple cyclamen and snowdrops.

It is a beautiful sight. It’s hard to imagine who would want to spoil that by stealing some of the plants. But somewhere, someone is planning their next heist. This year, however, the gardeners are ready for them.
