Gerald Howarth: The former defence minister said MPs must be allowed to debate the potential merger

The potential merger of BAE with Franco-German aviation giant EADS should be delayed so Parliament can discuss whether it is in the national interest, a former defence minister said yesterday.

Gerald Howarth, who was minister for security strategy until last month’s reshuffle, said the Government must not allow Paris and Berlin to gain control of the UK’s biggest defence firm.

BAE is in merger talks to gain a foothold in the European defence and civil aircraft markets.

But MPs are concerned that the £30billion deal would hand France and Germany at least a 9 per cent share each in the new company.

Mr Howarth said there were potential commercial advantages for BAE by diversifying outside the defence market.

But he said MPs must be allowed to debate and block any attempt to create a merged company which would give foreign governments the power to close British defence plants and lay off British workers.

The two companies are expected  to make a statement on their  plans to the stock market on October 10.

Mr Howarth said: ‘There has to be an extension. It’s not acceptable that the Government could make decisions alone where there are 100,000 jobs at stake.’

He added: ‘Politically it will be unsellable to Parliament for the French and German governments to have a large stake in the new company.

‘We can’t possibly have a company, our major defence contractor, with those governments as its shareholders deciding where to invest its money.’

'National interest': The Government must not allow Paris and Berlin to gain control of the UK's biggest defence firm, Mr Howarth said

The Government is locked in talks with the French, Germans and the two companies in a bid to limit the size of their share in the new company.

Downing Street has been spooked by proposals to let the French and German governments acquire further shares in the future.

EADS chief executive Tom Enders sought to reassure critics concerned about the potential for large redundancies by saying the deal was not about ‘slashing thousands of jobs’.
