The Queens Park Rangers squad have taken press-ups to a new level in their preparations for Monday's game against Everton, as shown by Shaun Wright-Phillips in a workout video with a difference.

The former England winger posted a video on social media site Kicca showing him and his team-mates taking part in a conga-style workout in the gym at QPR's training ground.

Accompanied by the caption, 'Having fun after a hard session in the gym', the video shows a long line of QPR players perform synchronised press-ups with their legs mounted on the team-mate behind them.

It creates quite a visual effect, as the players are spurred on by a coach in the minute-long workout video.

Rangers climbed out of the bottom three of the Premier League after their impressive 2-0 win against Burnley, and face a tough test away at Goodison Park on Monday.

The R's will be without top scorer Charlie Austin, who is suspended after he saw red on Saturday.

Defender Steven Caulker is fit though, despite needing hospital treatment on a cut sustained to his head while falling over at the QPR Christmas party last Sunday.
