It was a day of returns for Arsenal as they stormed to a 3-0 victory over Stoke on Sunday.

Olivier Giroud returned to the first-team after a three-game suspension and Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey were back on the Arsenal bench after lengthy injuries.

And in the stands at the Emirates, were two former Arsenal legends.

Thierry Henry and Robert Pires were all smiles as they watched Arsene Wenger's side put in a clinical performance against Stoke.
