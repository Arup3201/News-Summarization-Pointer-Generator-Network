Iraqi soldiers battling ISIS militants have recaptured most of the town of Beiji, home to the country's largest oil refinery.

The strategic town, which is situated 155 miles north of Baghdad, is now likely to become the base for a future push to take back Saddam Hussein's hometown. 

There was no word on the fate of the refinery, which lies on Beiji's northern outskirts, today but the advances in the town could help break the five-month siege of the facility by Islamic State fighters.

Since June, a small army unit inside the refinery has successfully resisted wave after wave of extremist assaults.

Lifting the siege of the refinery, which sits inside a sprawling complex, was said to be the next objective in the campaign to rid Beiji of the militants, according to military officials  in the town.

However, hours after news of the recapturing of Beiji broke, a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into a military outpost in the Tarmiyah district north of Baghdad, killing seven soldiers and wounding 13 others.

Those killed included the post's commander, a major, two other officers, a captain and a lieutenant, police said.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but it bore the hallmarks of the militant Sunnis of the Islamic State group. Elsewhere, nine people were killed and 24 injured in three separate blasts in and around Baghdad.

State television has today quoted the top army commander in Beiji, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, as saying troops also recaptured Beiji's local government and police headquarters at the centre of the town. 

It aired footage of army tanks and armored personnel carriers moving around the town's dusty streets and a ball of white smoke rising in the background.

Al-Saadi later spoke to state television by telephone but the line appeared to be cut off after he said his forces were meeting stiff resistance. Three military officials later said the advancing army troops and Shiite militiamen are being slowed down by booby-trapped houses and ambushes.

Raed Ibrahim, the governor of Salahuddin province, where both Beiji and Tikrit are located, said the military had secured about 75 per cent of the town, retaking the centre of the town and outlying districts. 

He said government forces continued to meet fierce resistance from the militants, whom he said were using suicide bombers to stall the military's advance. 

Neither the military officials nor Ibrahim gave casualty figures for the government forces or the militants.

The officials, however, said the forces had blocked access to Beiji from Anbar province, where militants control vast swaths of land, prior to their assault on the town to prevent militant reinforcements from reaching the city. 

Government officials in Baghdad offered no immediate comment on the news.

The Beiji oil refinery has a capacity of some 320,000 barrels a day, accounting for a quarter of Iraq's refining capacity. 

A fire raged for days back in June at one of its storage units, but the refinery is believed to have also suffered major damage elsewhere.

Iraq's army and security forces have partially regrouped after melting away in the face of the summer's Islamic State group offensive.

In recent weeks, they have recaptured a string of small towns and villages, but taking Beiji would be strategically significant in what is shaping up to be a drawn-out campaign of attrition against the extremists.

Recapturing Beiji also would be a major boost for Iraq's Shiite-led government. 

Airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition have aided Iraqi forces, militias and Kurdish peshmerga fighters battling Islamic State militants. Hundreds of U.S. advisers and trainers also have been working with the Iraqis.

U.S. Central Command said yesterday that coalition aircraft have conducted seven airstrikes near Beiji since Friday, destroying three small militant units, a sniper position and two militant vehicles, including one used for construction.
