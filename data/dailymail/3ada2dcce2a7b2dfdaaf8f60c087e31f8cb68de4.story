Former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon has admitted he contemplated suicide when he realised he was getting dementia, which he blames on the punishment he sucked up during this football career.

He said he would leave home and forget how to get back and spend weeks at a time in a darkened room because the pain in his head was so bad.

In his darkest moments, he said, he thought of ending his life.

Former NFL football quarterback Jim McMahon speaks during a news conference in Chicago where he told reporters of his ongoing battle with dementia that he believe is related the punishment of pro football

'I am glad I don't have any weapons in my house or else I am pretty sure I wouldn't be here,' he said. 'It got to be that bad.'

McMahon is one of several players in a federal lawsuit filed last month in California that accuses teams of dishing out powerful drugs to keep players on the field despite injuries.

He is also part of a class-action lawsuit which the NFL has agreed to settle for $765million without admitting it hid the risk of concussion from players.

McMahon, 54, spoke about his struggles with dementia and depression with a small group of reporters, including Associated Press sports writer Andrew Seligman, yesterday.

He was clear that he believes his health problems were brought on by the beating he suffered as a professional footballer.

McMahon playing with the Chicago Bears in 1983. He said he had three to five diagnosed concussions and, he believes, many more that went undiagnosed

McMahon said he had three to five diagnosed concussions and who knows how many more that went undiagnosed, reported the Associated Press.

He also suffered injuries to his kidney, broken ribs, an addiction to painkillers and even a broken neck he claims that team doctors never told him about.

It was only five years ago, after X-rays and an MRI, that doctors told him he had broken his neck at some point.

McMahon believes it happened while he was playing with the Minnesota Vikings in 1993, when he got sandwiched by two Giants defenders in a playoff game at New York - and was left unable to move his legs.

Eventually he made it off the field but, after just 10 minutes, 'like an idiot' decided to get back on the pitch. Another slight graze to his head and his legs went numb again, forcing him out of the game.

McMahon told the reporters that despite the match-ending injury, a doctor only asked him how he felt and did not examine him. He said there's 'no doubt about it', the team knew his neck was broken, AP reports.

The news agency asked the Vikings for comment, but had received no reply by the time its writer Mr Seligman published his story.

McMahon's dementia diagnosis came at about the same time he learned of his broken neck. He had begun having trouble remembering names of people he'd met, and even people he knew for years.

Then he started getting lost after leaving his house, suffering mood swings, and holing up in his bedroom in the dark for weeks on end, leaving only if he had an appearance to make.

'I can see how some of these guys have ended their lives, because of the pain,' AP quoted McMahon as saying.

The more than 4,800 former players who are party to the concussion lawsuit had alleged the NFL misled players about the long-term dangers the brain injuries posed.

The lawsuit doesn't specify which medical problems are suffered by the retired players. But it says they have included headaches, dizziness, loss of memory, dementia, depression, impulse control, impulsivity to anger, physical disability, embarrassment, and a 'loss of the pleasures of life'.

And it is similar in wording to several previous lawsuits, accusing the NFL of 'carelessness, negligence, intentional misconduct and concealment of information' directly connected with the players' injuries.

McMahon messages his head and neck after game against the New England Patriots in Chicago. He also suffered injuries to his kidney, broken ribs, a painkillers addiction and even a broken neck he says he wasn't told about

The 18-page document, seen by MailOnline, says the plaintiffs are seeking damages to be decided by a jury for long-term or chronic injuries, along with funds for medical treatment.

'For over 40 years [the NFL] have continuously and fervently denied that it knew, should have known or believed there to be any relationship between NFL players suffering concussions while playing, the NFL policies concerning tackling methodology,' the complaint says.

It adds that evidence showing concussion causes the brain condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been readily available 'for more than 100 years'.

The complaint notes that the most dangerous tackles - where players used their heads as a 'weapon' - were outlawed in the late 1970s.

But it adds that the laws were not well-enforced, saying: 'The NFL wanted to keep its fan base excited by the visual exhilaration witnessing such hazardous techniques.

'Despite the NFLâ€™s knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades.'

McMahon is bitter about the way the NFL has treated former players. 'The NFL continues to make billions and billions of dollars every year, and some of these guys are homeless,' he was quoted as saying.

'They don't know who they are, and they were the ones who built this brand to where it's at.'
