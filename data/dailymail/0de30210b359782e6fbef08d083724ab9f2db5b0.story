The Football League has agreed to put Leeds owner Massimo Cellino's ban on hold until after his appeal has been heard.

Cellino had been ordered to step down from the club's board of directors on December 29 after the League disqualifed him under its 'owners' and directors' test' earlier this month following a thorough investigation.

But the governing body has now reached agreement with the Italian's legal team and he will be allowed to stay on as a club director while his appeal is being considered.

Massimo Cellino has faced an ongoing battle to convince the Football League he is fit to run Leeds United

The Italian bought 75% of the club in February, but the move was initially blocked a month later

Leeds fans were opposed to the 58-year-old's involvement, but some have been won over since

A League statement read: 'The Football League and the legal representatives of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, have agreed the process and date of Mr. Cellino's appeal against the decision by The Football League Board that he is subject to a disqualifying condition under its Owners' and Directors' Test.

'The matter will be heard by a Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by Tim Kerr QC on January 15.

'The original decision required Mr. Cellino to resign as a director of Leeds United and cease acting as a 'relevant person' in line with Football League regulations by December 29.

February 2014: Leeds United announce that Massimo Cellino has agreed a 75% buy-out of the club, subject to approval from the Football League.

March 2014: A court in Sardinia finds Cellino guilty of illegally evading import duty. Ordered to pay a €600,000 fine after being convicted of failing to pay €388,500 in tax on a yacht seized by Italian police and customs officials in June 2013.

Back in England, Football League vote unanimously to block Cellino's takeover of Leeds and disqualify him from owning the club after failing their owners and directors test.

April 2014: Cellino wins his appeal the decision, with his Eleonora Sports company completing the purchase of a 75 per cent stake in Leeds from Gulf Finance House Capital.

June 2014: Cellino agrees to sell Cagliari to Italian company Fluorsid for an undisclosed fee.

October 2014: Cellino's court trial in Italy for tax evasion for allegedly failing to pay import duty of around £75,000 on a second yacht is delayed after the judge decided to step down due to a conflict of interest.

December 2014: The Football League announce that Cellino has again been disqualified from owning the club after they received detailed evidence from the Italian court that convicted him of tax evasion on his second yacht.

'The League has agreed to defer that deadline until two days after the handing down of the final decision of the PCC.

'As a consequence, the parties have agreed that if Mr Cellino is unsuccessful in his appeal, any disqualification period will be extended by an amount equivalent to the length of time between December 29 and the deferred deadline.

'The parties have agreed to make no further comment prior to the hearing of the PCC on January 15.'

Cellino was disqualified from being owner of Leeds on December 1 when the governing body announced he had failed its 'owners' and directors' test.'

Cellino had successfully appealed against the League's decision to block his takeover of Leeds in April, but after receiving further evidence from the Italian court that convicted him of tax evasion in March, the governing body ruled he was not fit to continue as the club's president.

The League ruled the 58-year-old would be able to resume in his role at Elland Road on March 18 when his conviction is spent under UK law.

Cellino, currently in Miami, announced he was prepared to stand down on December 29 to safeguard Leeds from further sanctions.

This latest development means Cellino will continue in his role of club president throughout the January transfer window, while the appeal verdict is scheduled for three weeks after his hearing.
