Tragic: Krista Nichols, 5, was found hanged in her family's home

Sacramento police have started an investigation after a five-year-old girl was found hanged in bizarre circumstances in her living room on Sunday.

Krista Nichols died after becoming entangled in a piece of string she had managed to loop around a ceiling hook for plants.

The child's heartbroken grandmother, Moang Saelee, said no one was in the same room as Krista when she died in what the family described as a 'freak accident'.

Ms Saelee was out when Krista died and an aunt who was at home was said to have been in another room talking on the telephone.

No arrests have been made but Sacramento police told CBS 13 they were investigating the circumstances of the death and whether Krista was being looked after properly.

The family don't believe Krista intended to harm herself, and the grandmother was in tears as she recalled how she had been running errands at the time.Â 

'I'm not home, it's just my daughter home and her auntie home, but her auntie in the bathroom and talk on the phone,' Ms Saelee said. 'I'm so sad. I think about her much.'

She said no one was sure how her grandchild, who she described as happy and lovely, managed to loop the string around the plant hook before becoming tangled in it.

A neighbor, who didn't want to be identified, told CBS the family's children often played unsupervised in their yard.

'We had some concerns, especially through the summertime, the kids were out unsupervised often,' the woman said.

'A couple of months ago, the same girl supposedly went missing. The 
police were out and then they found her under the bed later.'
