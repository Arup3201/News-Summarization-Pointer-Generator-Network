'Well my dad, it's like a great year for him,' Sutter said.

He added, 'Let's do it again!'

The LA 
Kings beat the New York Rangers 3-2 in double overtime. It was the 
team's second Stanley Cup championship in three years.

In the interview, Kopitar referred to Sutter as 'like a brother.'

'He feels like a brother to me,' Kopitar said. 'When we get down during the season, since it's such a long time, he comes in the room and he jokes around with us, we play a little basketball with him and he always lightens up the mood and it's so, so nice to have him around now.'

Darryl Sutter spoke to the Toronto Sun this week and explained his close relationship with his son.

'I can stand and talk to Chris and know what he’s talking about, but you might not be able to,' he told the paper. 'It’s the same thing when you talk to the other challenged children; you can pick up what they’re trying to do, right?'

The Sun also reported that the hockey coach regularly keeps in touch with families who also have members with Down syndrome, many of whom reach out to him directly.

'You feel almost responsible to do it,' Sutter told the paper. 'You feel responsible, like you should do it. And that’s a good thing. It makes you feel good, too.'
