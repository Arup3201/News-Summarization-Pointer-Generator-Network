They are the kind of palatial suite that wouldn’t look out of place in the penthouse of the world’s grandest hotels.

In fact, these are the luxury berths that feature on the breath-taking Quantum of the Seas cruise ship.

The two-storey loft suites feature private balconies and their own dining rooms, and come with a dedicated concierge service, while the spectacular Royal Loft suite comes with its own whirlpool.

However, the luxury rooms don't come cheap.

An eight-night stay in the Royal Loft Suite for a Bahamas cruise costs £7,499 per person - almost £1,000 each a night.

The trip departs from Cape Liberty in New Jersey and calls at Port Canaveral in Florida, and Nassau and Cococay in the Bahamas before returning to Cape Liberty.

The rooms cost £133,000 each to build.

Touted as the world’s first smartship, Quantum of the Seas is the most high-tech cruise ship in the world, boasting wristbands that serve as room keys, speedy wifi and a skydiving simulator.

Royal Caribbean International’s brand new ship is one of the most luxurious in the world with 18 decks and room for 4,905 guests, and is one of the most luxurious vessels in the world.

At 1,141ft long, Quantum Of The Seas is the length of 41 London buses and longer than five Boeing 747s. It’s the third largest cruise ship in the world. It is 2.5ft longer than the Great Pyramid of Giza is tall.

Its most striking feature is the unique North Star, a jewel-shaped glass observation capsule suspended from a giant arm that lifts passengers over 300ft above sea level.

The passenger pod, similar to the capsules on the London Eye, offers 360-degree panoramic views of the ocean.

In addition to a skydiving simulator, the 1,142ft ship boasts a surf simulator, rock climbing wall and multiple venues for live performances.

Billed as ‘the world’s most futuristic and advanced ship’, Quantum of the Seas is the first in Royal Caribbean’s new Quantum class of vessels.

Built at Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg Germany, it has more than 2,000 guest rooms and an area known as SeaPlex, the largest indoor active space at sea, complete with a flying trapeze, basketball court and three firsts for a cruise ship – bumper cars, roller skating and a food truck.

It has the fastest internet speeds at sea using a new generation of mid-Earth orb satellites, and smartphone apps that allow guests to plan their shore excursions, book restaurant reservations or set up spa appointments.

On Sunday the ship began its voyage from Southampton to a port near New York.

After spending its inaugural season in North America the 168,000-tonne ship will relocate to Shanghai in the spring. An eight-night Caribbean holiday is priced from £879 per person.

Decks four and five are lined with elegant Las Vegas-style restaurants, bars and shops selling everything from pints of beer and slices of pizza, to champagne and diamonds. 

Level 16 boasts iFly - the world's first skydive simulator at sea - as well as North Star, a five-star spa, a surf simulator, and a climbing wall.

Deck 15 is where guests can find swimming pools, sunbeds and hottubs - as well as a pool-side bar playing music and serving drinks throughout the day.

Inside, the ship's awesome architecture is complemented by a multi-million dollar art collection – from a huge butterfly wall by the glass lifts, and on-board galleries, to the 30ft-tall magenta polar bear made from stainless steel triangles standing proud on the ship’s exterior deck.
