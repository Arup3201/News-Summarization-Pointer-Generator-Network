The Ministry of Justice is investigating how receipts allegedly belonging to serial killer Rosemary West and stolen from the prison where she is serving a life sentence ended up on eBay.

The jail receipts were put on the site by convicted rapist George Galloway, 50. The online auction site has said it will remove the items – which contain confidential information such as West’s alleged cell number – after being alerted by The Mail on Sunday.

Galloway put the receipts from Low Newton prison, near Durham, on eBay in April with bids starting at £300.

Fred West killed himself while on remand accused of 12 murders. His wife Rose was convicted of 10 murders in 1995

When an undercover MoS reporter contacted him asking him to prove authenticity, he said: ‘They are genuine ’cos I work in the prison see. I work in the canteen.’

A source from the MoJ said last night: ‘We will be conducting an investigation into how the receipts were obtained.’

Last night, Cleveland Police said: ‘Following an investigation, a 50-year-old man from Middlesbrough has been arrested on suspicion of theft and is in custody. Enquiries are ongoing.’

West, Britain’s most notorious female serial killer, was convicted of ten murders in 1995 after remains of victims were found at the Gloucester home she shared with her partner Fred West.

He was accused of 12 murders but committed suicide while on remand in prison.
