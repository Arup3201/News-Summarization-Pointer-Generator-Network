Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has denied that the club put pressure on England boss Roy Hodgson to rest Raheem Sterling for the Three Lions' Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia on Sunday.

Sterling started in the victory against San Marino the previous Thursday but was left out of the starting line-up on Sunday, although he came off the bench to win the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored the only goal.

Rodgers insists that Sterling never said he did not want to play and that it was Hodgson's decision to leave the forward out of the starting XI.

'I'm fed up reading about this club v country, claims we intervened and put pressure on Roy Hodgson,' Rodgers told The Independent.

'I've read we sent a dossier to the FA on Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge and I'm having showdown talks with Roy Hodgson on Sunday and all sorts of rubbish. 

'The decision not to play him was a managerial decision. 

'I haven't said a single word but have to say I have never seen such rubbish written over the past few days.'

Rodgers feels Sterling is not being fairly treated and does not believe the criticism will end any time soon.

'At no point did Raheem Sterling say he didn't want to play for England,' he added. 

'The boy is being hung out to dry and I dare say the criticism will continue for a few more weeks to come because of this.'
