Recipes, cures and handy hints from a Victorian housewife have been given a new lease of life on the internet.

Over the years, Sarah Matthews, born in 1893, noted down all her recipes for cakes, cures, medicines, furniture polishes and handy hints from days gone by in elegantly-written Victorian handwriting.

And she left this treasure trove of handy hints to her granddaughter-in-law Patricia Matthews when she died in 1970.

Mrs Matthews used the book (which she's holding in the picture) handed down to her from her husband's grandmother to make cakes for her children and grandchildren - but in 2007 decided she wanted to share Grandma Sarah's legacy with others and publish it - the result was Grandma's Antique Recipes

Among the recipes is her improbable 'cake determined by weight of the egg'. Weigh an egg, then take equal quantities of sugar, butter, rice flour, and vanilla essence, mix and bake.

 A tablespoon of boiling water added to sponge mix makes lighter sponge cakes.

To help green vegetables keep their colour boil in the pan without the lid.

The best way of making curdled custard smooth is to stand it in a pan of cold water and beat with an egg whisk until smooth.

To prevent skin forming on boiled milk, cover the pan with a plate or saucer, thus saving all the goodness.

When making oatmeal porridge or cooking rice, if the pot is greased with lard or butter first it is much easier to clean.

Mrs Matthews has since used the book to make cakes for her children and grandchildren - but in 2007 decided she wanted to share Grandma Sarah's legacy with others and make it into a book - Grandma's Antique Recipes. 

In May a publisher got in touch with her and said they would take the book on. It's currently available on Amazon as a Kindle download.

A donation from every book sold is going to The Christie Hospital in Manchester. 

Grandma Sarah's recipes are all in original imperial measurements, and rely on basic equipment and elbow grease.

Favourites include Tennis Cake, Potato Pie, jams and preserves, Simnel Cake, lemonade and ginger wine.

Mrs
 Matthews said: 'She was the only girl and was born in Salford in 1893 
but moved to Bolton after her mum died. Over the years, while baking and
 cooking for her family, she documented all her tips and tricks in her 
little recipe book.

'When my husband Ronnie and I started courting we would go round to her house and it would always smell of baking. She was a God-fearing, straight-laced person who wouldn't stand for any messing - but she had a wicked sense of humour.

'We will never see the like of this kind of woman ever again. They were very resilient people in those days.'
