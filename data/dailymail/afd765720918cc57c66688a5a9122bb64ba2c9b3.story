Football fans who braved the bitterly cold weather to attend Monday night’s football game between the Chicago Bears and the Dallas Cowboys had more to content with than just the frigid conditions when their beer started to freeze.

Chicago has a well-earned reputation for brutally cold winters, but Monday night set a new record as temperatures plunged and the Windy City experienced its coldest December night in 18 years.

Players as well as spectators had to suffer the bone-chilling conditions, but while pitch side they used heaters to thaw out their Gatorade buckets, fans in the stands weren’t so lucky.

Several bear-drinkers posted photos on social media sites of their frozen beverages, including one person whose drink had so completely turned to ice that they could turn their cup upside down and not spill any.

Bears fans could at least enjoy the result, a convincing 45:28 win which puts them right back in the playoff race, but spare a thought for the poor Cowboy’s fans who sat through what is officially the coldest regular-season game in teams' history.

Of course the coldest game in franchise history is the Ice Bowl, the 1967 NFL Championship when it was minus-13 at kickoff and the Cowboys lost to the Green Bay Packers 21-17 at Lambeau Field.

The official game-time temperature on Monday was a frigid eight degrees and wind chill conditions made it feel below zero, but it doesn’t come close to the coldest days ever in Chicago.

Would you like ice with that sir? Football fans amused themselves at Monday's nights game by posting photos on social media sites as their drinks quickly turned to ice

The coldest day ever in Chicago happened nearly 30 years ago on Jan. 20, 1985, when the temperature was 27 degrees below zero.

The coldest December day ever was Christmas Eve in 1983, when the temperature dropped to 25 below.

The last time Chicago had subzero temperatures this early in the season was Dec. 9, 1995.
