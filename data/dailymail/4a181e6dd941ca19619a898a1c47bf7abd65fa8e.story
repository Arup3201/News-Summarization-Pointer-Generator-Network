In the 1930s, countries around the world began to introduce white canes, which both helped blind people ‘feel’ the ground in front of them and made them more visible.

The invaluable tool has barely been innovated since, but now several companies have developed technologies that help the cane ‘sense’ objects nearby.

So-called smart canes use sonar to let blind people know, through vibrations, if there are objects ahead - and which way to go to avoid them.

The SmartCane (illustration pictured) helps visually impaired people navigate obstacles and people. The device, which attaches to the top of standard white canes, uses sonar technology and vibrations to tell a user how far away an object is and can detect obstacles above knee level, preventing accidents

The SmartCane is designed to help users detect obstacles above knee-level and prevent accidents from occurring.

Using sensors, the device detects obstructions up to a distance of 10ft (three metres).

It
 attaches to the top of a standard folding white cane, currently used by
 millions of visually impaired people across the globe.

The SmartCane mimics the capabilities of bats, using sonar to detect objects in the surrounding environment.

Ultrasound
 waves are sent out and, when they return to the cane, they vibrate on 
the relevant side of to warn of an obstacle ahead.

Different patterns and intensities let the user know how far away an object is.

The latest smart cane to hit the market is the aptly named SmartCane, from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi’s Assistive Technologies Group (AssisTech).

According to the World Health Organisation, 285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide.

Almost 90 per cent of these live in developing countries, with India home to the most, at 12 million.

With that in mind, the SmartCane is designed to help users detect obstacles above knee-level and prevent accidents from occurring.

Using sensors, the device detects obstructions up to a distance of 10ft (three metres).

These sensors can detect a small 1-inch (3cm) wide and are adjustable, meaning people of different heights and with different cane holding styles can still use the device.

Different patterns and intensities let the user know how far away an object is.

The device was perfected after extensive field trials with over 150 people and is now on sale for the equivalent of £30 ($50).

Another, similar device is called the UltraCane. It uses similar technology to help blind people navigate. It comes equipped with a dual-range, narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a hazard protection area in front of the user (pictured)

SmartCane claim the device is especially useful for blind people avoiding obstacles (demonstration pictured) when they don't have assistance, including low-hanging tree branches. Each side of the device vibrates with different intensity if an obstacle is ahead to let the user know which way to move to avoid a collision

An ultrasound sensor kit could enable people with visual impairments to ride a bicycle independently.

The
 UltraBike unit has sensors to give the rider constant directional 
feedback of obstacles ahead and at each side, via vibrating buttons 
beneath each thumb.

The
 device, which is detachable and can be fitted onto the handlebars of 
any bike, was designed by electronics engineer and entrepreneur Paul 
Clark.

‘Blindness
 is not just a medical condition but possesses the larger dimensions of 
social exclusion, stigma and neglect,’ said Dr Rohal Paul, who has 
played a key role in the development of the SmartCane.

‘Blind
 people are often taken by surprise by over-hanging branches, protruding
 air-conditioners and parked vehicles while navigating through 
unfamiliar terrain.

‘SmartCane warns the user of such objects in their path through a unique system of vibratory patterns, designed to detect potential obstacles even at head height.’

And Dr Diana Tay, Business Development Manager for Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust said: 'The SmartCane is a mobility aid device that will have a positive impact on the day-to-day activities of the visually impaired in India and possibly further afield.

'The cross-disciplinary team approach behind the SmartCane has enabled the successful delivery of this technology to the marketplace.'

Another device known as the UltraCane (pictured) is on sale in the UK. It comes equipped with a dual-range, narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a 'hazard protection area' in front of the user using similar ultrasound technology to the SmartCane

Despite its innovation, the SmartCane is not the first such product to hit the market.

Another known as the UltraCane was launched in various countries including the UK back in 2011, using a similar technology.

It comes equipped with a dual-range, narrowbeam ultrasound system that provides a hazard protection area in front of the user.

Two ultrasound sensors provide range data on the closest potential hazards such as plants, people, road signs and over-hanging branches.

And two small, button-shaped tactile vibrators on the handle give the user information about upcoming obstacles in much the same way as the SmartCane.

Both devices are seen as being invaluable tools for the visually impaired, and could help to drastically reduce the number of accidents that occur when using white canes.
