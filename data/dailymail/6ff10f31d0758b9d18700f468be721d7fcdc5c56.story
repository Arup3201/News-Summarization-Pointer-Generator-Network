A Sydney man was determined to create the ultimate travel experience on a European trip of a lifetime but has tragically died in a boating accident in Croatia.

Alex Daleo, 23, was at a yacht event on Saturday, when he believed to have fatally hit his head while trying to jump from one boat to another at a popular tourist spot.

The former Woolooware High School student has prompted an outpouring of grief from friends and family, particularly his twin brother Lucas.

'My brother, my best mate! I love and miss you so much. I'm truly blessed to have spent the past 23 years with you by my side even through all the times we were fighting, the love was always there,' he wrote on Facebook.

'I'd do absolutely anything I could to change what's happened, there right when they say the good die young! I am so glad that we got to travel the world together before you were taken from us.

'I promise I'll keep my head up and do you proud with everything I do in my life. Please send us a sign every now and then to let us know your doing alright! Your my hero I will always look up to you, life will never be the same without you brother. R.I.P my brother ALEX DALEO.'

Before leaving Sydney Airport, the tradesman from Taren Point in Sydney's south posted, 'someone once told me that one day your life will flash before your eyes, so make sure it's worth watching...'

'Today I set out with my best mates to make that movie worth watching for so many different reasons... Sydney will always be here so see you when I see you,' he said.

Social media paints a picture of a young, outgoing tradesman who had been travelling with his mates through Europe, taking in an international festival in Belgium and visiting popular tourist destinations including Barcelona and Ibiza.

Mr Daleo documented his travelling journey through his Instagram page.
