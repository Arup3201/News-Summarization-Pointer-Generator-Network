It has become known for its pushy sales techniques and brightly coloured Minis driven around by its staff.

Now Foxtons estate agent, which started life as a single branch in 1981, is to go public in a floatation that could value it at more than £400m.

Its private equity owners are lining up the stock market listing in a bid to cash in on soaring house prices in London.

Boom time: The owners of Foxtons are lining up a stock market floatation in a bid to cash in on soaring house prices which at 2.6per cent are growing at their highest annual rate in more than two-and-a-half years

Now has 40 offices: Foxtons was sold to BC Partners by founder Jon Hunt (right) in 2007 after starting life as a single branch

BC Partners, which bought the chain 
in 2007 for about £375m just before the market crashed, is understood to
have appointed Credit Suisse, Numis Securities and Canaccord Genuity to
advise on the floatation.

The chain of about 40 offices in and around the capital has grown since its buyout by adding about 20 offices.

Founder Jon Hunt sold the firm in May 2007, just months before the credit crunch sent house prices plunging.

The company was taken over by its 
lenders in 2010 in a deal which slashed its debt, before the private 
equity firm regained control last year.

BC Partners, which also owns mobile 
phone retailer Phones4U, has reportedly described its purchase of 
Foxtons as a ‘mistake’ with partners referring to the estate agency as 
the ‘F-word’.

It is thought
it is keen to start the floatation soon as it seeks to take advantage 
of a recovering housing market, which has been boosted by government 
stimulus schemes including its Help to Buy loan scheme.

The
move comes as mortgage lender Halifax reported a 0.4 per cent rise in 
UK house prices in May and said the annual growth rate of 2.6 per cent 
was its highest level in more than two-and-a-half years.

Property values raced ahead in May to
record their strongest year-on-year increase for more than two years in
a further sign the market is gathering momentum, according to the 
latest Halifax house price index.

Float: The owners of Foxtons want to capitalise from the rocketing house prices currently seen in London

It
found house prices rose by 2.6 per cent annually last month to reach 
£166,898 on average – the largest annual uplift since September 2010.

In May 2012, the average property value was £160,906 - or £5,992 less than today’s figure.

On a month-on-month basis, prices 
increased by 0.4 per cent. This was a smaller leap than the 1.1 per cent
growth recorded in April, but the fourth month in a row of rises.

Industry figures yesterday showed Help to Buy has got off to a ‘flying start’ with 4,000 homes reserved for purchase in the two months since its launch.

The UK’s biggest estate agency chain Countrywide also rejoined the stock market earlier this year, valued at more than £800m.

The group, which has almost 1000 branches, trades through brands including Bairstow Eves, Gascoigne-Pees and Hamptons International.
