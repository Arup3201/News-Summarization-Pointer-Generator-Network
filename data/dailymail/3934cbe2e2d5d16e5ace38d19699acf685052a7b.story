Colleges students graduating from the University of Connecticut's School of Engineering received a unique commencement speech from space on Saturday.

NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio delivered a pre-recorded address from inside the International Space Station.

Mastracchio said in his speech that he was orbiting 260 miles above the Earth and was set to return from his mission on May 13.

Out of this world: NASA astronaut Rick Mastracchio delivered a commencement speech from inside the International Space Station

'I was trying to figure out how to make this speech different than all the other commencement addresses that are given each year,' Mastracchio said in the video.

'And then I realized: I'm in a weightless environment, so maybe I should give this speech in a different orientation,' he said before making a flip.

'I probably have the best job on and off the planet,' he later said.

Mastracchio said he was inspired to become an astronaut after the Challenger disaster in 1986 - and got the job in 1996 after nine years of applications and three interviews.

He said the during the interim, he worked as a developer at the Johnson Space Center, completed a second master's degree, and even earned his pilot's license.

Flipping out: At the end of his speech Mastracchio even flipped upside down while wearing a UConn hat and cheering 'Go Huskies!'

Mastracchio then told the Class of 2014 that in order to become an astronaut or achieve other types of big goals, it requires near-daily hard work and perseverance.

Mastracchio also took time in his speech to tell the graduating students' families and friends to be 'impressed' with their accomplishments.

After congratulating the Connecticut students on their hard work, Mastracchio showed school pride when he put on a UConn baseball cap and said 'Go Huskies!' as he did another flip, referencing the school's athletic teams.
