She might have married a prince, but Kendra Spears hasn't given up the day job, as these exclusive images from Next's newest campaign reveal.

The model, 25, is now known as the Princess Salwa Aga Khan after marrying Prince Rahmin Aga Khan, the 42-year-old eldest son 
and heir of the Aga Khan, in August.

But despite her royal status - and her 
husband's estimated £800 million fortune - it seems the American 
model has no intention of retiring.

Smouldering: Fledgling royal Kendra Spears, 25, looks wonderful in the Next winter campaign

Elegant in a glamorous burgundy lace 
cocktail frock and chic petrol blue jumpsuit, the brunette beauty looks a
million dollars in the photos for the British high street brand, which were shot on location in New York 
by rising talent, Victor Demarchelier.

The
campaign, which will be unveiled officially on the 31st October, is the second to feature Spears.

The model seems busier than ever since marriage: along with fronting Next's most recent campaigns, she has also appeared in advertising for Prada, Calvin Klein, Etro and Diane von Furstenburg.

Magazine appearances have included starring on the covers of Vogue China and Elle France, and in editorial spreads for Dazed & Confused, V and Vogue Italia.

Chip off the old block: The photos are the work of Victor Demarchelier, the 28-year-old son of Patrick

In addition to the burgundy lace showstopper of a dress, Spears' current campaign for Next also sees her prowling the streets of New York in a chic black T-shirt dress and a stunning suede and leather biker jacket.

Other likely hits include a delicate champagne silk slip that neatly captures this season's key lingerie trend, a cosy faux fur jacket and a series of super-soft pastel knits vamped up with skinny leather trousers.

And Spears isn't the only star of Next's new campaign with a fashion pedigree to be proud of.

Photographer Demarchelier, 28, is the youngest son of legendary snapper Patrick and has an impressive reputation in the fashion world.

Although the Next campaign is his first, he has worked for some of the magazine world's biggest names with Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Vanity Fair and GQ all featuring on his CV.
