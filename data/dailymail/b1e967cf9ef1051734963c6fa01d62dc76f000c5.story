BBC presenter John Inverdale provoked fury yesterday after making a disparaging remark about the physical appearance of Women’s singles champion Marion Bartoli.

Speaking on Radio 5 Live, he posed the question: ‘Do you think Bartoli’s dad told her when she was little, “You’re never going to be a looker?”’

His comments an hour before Ms Bartoli's match against Germany's Sabine Lisicki sparked widespread criticism with the BBC forced to apologise.

But Bartoli today made light of his remarks - inviting Inverdale to ‘come and see me in my ball gown and heels’.

Crass remark: John Inverdale has forced the BBC into making an appology after he suggested that Marion Bartoli the women's Wimbledon champion was 'never going to be a looker'

Winner: Bartoli was attacked by Trolls on Twitter who criticised her looks and branded her as 'manly'

In an interview with journalists from
 her own country, Ms Bartoli said she wanted the BBC man to come and see
 her at the traditional end-of-Wimbledon ball in London.

She said: ‘Good, I invite this 
journalist to come and see me this evening in ball gown and heels, and 
in my opinion he could change his mind.’

Ms Bartoli also said: ‘It doesn't 
matter, honestly. I am not blonde, yes. That is a fact. Have I dreamt 
about having a model contract? No. I'm sorry. But have I dreamed about 
winning Wimbledon? Absolutely, yes.’’

Speaking on the show yesterday, Inverdale had said: ‘I just wonder if her dad, because he has obviously been the most influential person in her life, did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, "listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker".

‘"You are never going to be somebody like a Sharapova, you're never going to be 5ft 11, you're never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that".

‘"You are going to have to be the most dogged, determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it", and she kind of is.’

Bartoli’s father immediately rushed to her defence and the BBC was forced to apologise.

The
 French player’s father, Walter, who coached her until this year, said: 
‘The relationship between Marion and me has always been unbelievable so I
 don’t  know what this reporter is talking about.

‘When she was five years old she was playing like every kid and having fun on the tennis court. She’s my beautiful daughter.’

He was among friends and family who supported Marion from the players’ box – and she made a beeline for him after claiming her first grand slam title with a 6-1 6-4 victory over German Sabine Lisicki.

Twitter users were also highly critical, describing the remark as ‘shameful’ and ‘absolutely disgusting’.

One wrote: ‘John Inverdale is never going to be a looker, or a thinker, or as good at anything as Bartoli.’

Another
 said: ‘I can’t believe John Inverdale is so unpleasant and sexist about
 Marion Bartoli. Expect he will say, “It was just a joke”. No, it 
wasn’t, John.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We accept that this remark was insensitive and for that we apologise.’

Inverdale also gave a grovelling apology today.

Speaking at the start of 5 live's coverage of the men's final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, Inverdale said: ‘Before we start, I probably ought to just briefly return to yesterday and a clumsy phrase that I used about Marion Bartoli which has understandably caused something of a furore.

‘The point I was trying to make, in a rather ham-fisted kind of way, was that in a world where the public perception of tennis players is that they're all 6ft tall Amazonian athletes, Mario - who is the Wimbledon champion - bucks that trend.’

He said she was ‘a fantastic example to all young people that it's attitude and will and determination together, obviously, with talent that, in the end, does get you to the top.

‘So I have apologised to Marion by letter if any offence was caused and I do hope that we can leave the matter there now’.

The apology came as Bartoli faced a barrage of abuse from vile online trolls who took to Twitter to criticise her looks, saying that she did not deserve to win as she is too 'ugly'.

Another said: 'For the first time ever a man wins the women's Wimbledon final! Go team men. #balls'

And she was also told to: 'get a boob job with the money you won. ugly b****'.

But the Twitter attacks have prompted an outpouring of criticism online as with Bartoli supporters rushing to her defence.

One said: 'Bartoli as the complete underdog has just won Wimbledon. WHY ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HER FACE AND BODY!!?!'

Another added: 'Sadly being an amazing athlete counts for nothing if you're a woman :('

Bartoli
 had endured a difficult 2013 before Wimbledon after failing to pass 
the third round of any tournament. She had also never won a major tournament before.

'Honestly I just can't believe it,' she said. 'As a little girl I dreamt about this moment for so long.

'I
 was there in 2007 and I missed out. I know how it feels Sabine, and I'm
 sure, believe me, you'll be there one more time, I have no doubt about 
it.

'When I started this 
campaign on Court 14, I think if you told me I'd be here in the final I 
wouldn't believe you. To hold the trophy is unthinkable.

'I'm just so happy to be holding this trophy. It's been my dream since i was six years old.'
