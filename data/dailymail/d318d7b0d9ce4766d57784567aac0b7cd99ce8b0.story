Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi will be fighting for his political life tomorrow when he speaks to MPs ahead of a crucial confidence vote.

Berlusconi, 75, is currently involved in four trials - including one for having sex with an underage prostitute - and will attempt to rally MPs and reassure them he is still capable of running the country, which is teetering on the edge of a financial meltdown.

In-party squabbling between members of his ruling right-wing coalition meant that many failed to turn up for a crucial vote on the state of the country's public accounts earlier this week - a vote that Berlusconi lost.

No way out? Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi will be fighting for his political life tomorrow when he speaks to MPs ahead of a crucial confidence vote

Berlusconi will speak to parliament in Rome at 11am on Thursday morning - just 24 hours after Italy's president Giorgio Napolitano called for ''credible answers' from the country's government.

The confidence vote will take place on Friday and, if he loses, Berlusconi - whose reputation has come under scrutiny following revelations of his sordid 'bunga bunga' sex parties - will have no option but to resign.

This would mean a general election ahead of the scheduled 2013 ballot.

Following the defeat in the Italian lower house earlier this week there were chants from opposition benches of 'resign, resign' and even some of his own allies were questioning whether he could still remain in power after such a public humiliation which dominated TV and newspaper headlines.

A front page editorial in La Repubblica newspaper headlined 'The Duty of Resigning' said that the defeat for Berlusconi in the vote was a 'devastating and defining politically' for him and his centre right coalition.

However, Berlusconi remained upbeat 
with sources saying he was confident of carrying the confidence vote - 
one of several he has faced in his political career - and that he would 
be stressing in his speech how it was 'irresponsible' of the opposition 
to try and topple the government when the country is facing an economic 
crisis.

Fabrizio Cicchitto,
leader of Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in parliament, said: 
'The prime minister will address the House on Thursday and will then ask
for their confidence on Friday.

'The vote is the only way of measuring the relationship between Government and parliament.

'The
opposition are making a mistake if they think the loss earlier this 
week was a sign of no confidence in the Government - there is a 
difference between a vote of confidence and a no confidence vote.'

Political
commentators say the chances of Berlusconi losing the vote are slim as 
he and party whips will ensure the 30 or so MPs missing from the vote 
earlier this week are in attendance.

Opposition leader Pier Luigi Bersani,
of the Democratic Left, said: 'This is the 53rd vote of confidence that
has been called and it is now becoming a joke - the only clear position
is his resignation.'

Italy - the third largest economy in the Eurozone - has a debt of more than Â£1trillion or 120 per cent of its GDP.

Despite
introducing a belt tightening 53billion euro austerity package earlier 
this summer there are fears the country is heading the same way as 
neighbour Greece.

Financial
ratings agencies and commentators say the lack of strong leadership 
from Berlusconi and the internal squabbling indicate that he is not 
strong enough to carry through policies and reforms to save the 
country's economy.

Besides 
the underage sex case which resumes next month, he is also on trial for 
corruption and abuse of office and one commentator said he was spending 
more time 'talking to his lawyers then governing and should be talking 
more to Jean-Claude Trichet the head of the European Bank.'

If he loses, Berlusconi will almost certainly have to quit
