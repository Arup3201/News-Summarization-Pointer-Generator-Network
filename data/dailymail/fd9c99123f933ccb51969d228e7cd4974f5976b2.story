More than 10,000 children will soon have a bit more colour in their school day after a district came up with a novel way of easing its money worries.

Schools in Pennsbury, Pennsylvania, will soon feature adverts as big as 5ft by 10ft across their walls, floors, lockers, benches and lunch hall tables.

More than 200 adverts will appear in 16 primary, middle and high schools - and they are expected to generate up to $424,000 for the district.

Pennsbury School District officials came up with the idea as they try to repair a battered budget, reported the Philadelphia Inquirer.

They signed up with a national marketing agency for the adverts - which must be about health, education, nutrition or student safety.

The adverts are not allowed to directly endorse products but can promote subjects such as outdoor activities and concussion awareness.

The U.S. Library of Congress, Post-it Notes and Dick’s Sporting Goods are all expected to advertise in the schools.

‘It's imperative we find alternate means to preserve our programmes,’ Assistant Superintendent W. David Bowman told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Minneapolis-based School Media said its deal will help firms contribute to education.

The company has deals with nine other districts in Minnesota and California, a spokesman said.

In another similar move, New Jersey will soon allow school districts to place adverts on school buses, reported the Philadelphia Inquirer.
