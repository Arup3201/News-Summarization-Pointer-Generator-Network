Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has insisted his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge was 'just to a little blip' after admitting another relapse could kill him.

The 47-year-old, who appeared happy and relaxed as he was spotted grocery shopping near his home in the Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, has adopted a healthier lifestyle after declaring: 'The only person who can save me is me.’

Friends claim the former midfielder, who has struggled with alcohol addiction for several years, has taken up a fresh diet and exercise regime less than a month after he was sectioned and put on a three-day emergency detox following a relapse.

Recovering: Paul Gascoigne is said to be doing well a month after he was sectioned following an apparent alcohol binge. He appeared relaxed out shopping this week near his home in Poole, Bournemouth

Struggle: Friends are said to have credited a new diet and exercise regime, and his girlfriend's support

The former football star, who retired from the game in 2004, blamed his recent 'blip' on boredom but said he felt 'victimised' by doctors who sectioned him.

He admitted he had 'messed up' but said he felt he had not done anything wrong to warrant being held at the hospital.

He has now vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that the booze will kill him.

Speaking to The Sun's Mike Hamilton, he said: ‘I know it's true. But as long as I stay how I am now and enjoy life, I will be OK.

'I have had tests on everything - liver, kidneys and heart. And it has all come up fine. I have been very lucky with my liver. 

‘There is nothing wrong with me – as long as I don’t pick up a can’.

The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle star, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly.

Gascoigne, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

Following his latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24, the star was placed on a three-day emergency detox following an apparent alcohol binge.

During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day.

Since returning to his seaside home, he is said to have continued with his exercise regime and his efforts appeared to be paying off when he was spotted shopping for groceries last week.  

He smiled towards onlookers as he bought groceries including milk and air freshener, alongside a copy of The Sun and Hello! magazine.

During his outing to the supermarket, he also visited an off-licence - but only to buy cigarettes. 

As well as making daily trips to the gym, the former footballer is also  concentrating on his diet and abstaining from alcohol, friends told the Sunday People. 

He also continues to be supported by his close friend and rumoured girlfriend Mandy Thomas, 44, who has stood by his side throughout the last few turbulent months. 

They are said to have met and become friendly after Gascoigne visited the post office she runs in Bournemouth, Dorset, several years ago.

First outing: Gascoigne was spotted putting the bins out a week ago in his first public appearance since  being sectioned under the Mental Health Act on October 24. He was seen in a dressing gown and pyjamas

His recent outing comes just seven days after he was spotted putting the bins out in what was his first public appearance since his hospitalisation. 

He looked downcast as he was spotted carrying out the chore outside his Dorset home wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes.

He was also sporting cuts to his face following a recent fall, but these appear to have healed somewhat and he looked the picture of health during his most recent outing. 

Following his trip to the shops, the Gateshead-born footballer also made a trip to his home city yesterday to encourage budding footballers.

He grinned as he posed with young players from Wallsend Boys FC, with the reaction on Twitter proving his enduring popularity.

'The lads with Gazza after the game today,' said one supporter. 'Absolute legend'.
