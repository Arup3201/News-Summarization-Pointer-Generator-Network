This is the moment a five foot long unexploded Second World War bomb discovered under a building site in south London was blown up.

A controlled explosion was carried out in a quarry at Cliffe in Kent this morning after the German device was discovered under a former pensioners home in Bermondsey in the Southwark borough on Monday.

Soldiers of 11 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment) Royal Logistics Corps used two kilogrammes of high explosives  to blow up the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb.

The 1,000lb explosive was transported to the site in Kent, owned by Brett Aggregates, inside a skip packed with sand and loaded onto a lorry, which was flanked by police yesterday.

The area in Bermondsey, Southwark, which was severely bombed during the Blitz in the Second World War, was put into lockdown from Monday night.

It is believed the bomb was dropped over London by the Luftwaffe on 11 May 1941 but unusually did not detonate. 

More than 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes following the discovery by builders working on the construction site of the former Southwark Irish Pensioners centre.

A police cordon sealed off 200 metres of land surrounding the bomb site for 32 hours as the Army built a bunker around the bomb to safely defuse it. 

The  teams, who had previously worked on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, used Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there.

A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings.  

Senior Ammunition Technician John Lester said it was a 'a live munition in a dangerous condition' which had to be taken far from the city before it could be safely destroyed. 

SAT Lester, of 11 EOD, Royal Logistic Corps, said: 'This bomb was a live munition in a dangerous condition. It had been disturbed by some pretty heavy building machinery, which is never a good thing. Bombs don't like being bashed around.

'But once we'd uncovered it, we knew what we were dealing with and it was just a question of solving the puzzle quickly so we could get it away and the good residents of Bermondsey back in their homes.

'We knew we had to get it away to dispose of it safely because trying to deal onsite with a bomb that size, even under a controlled explosion, would cause significant damage to buildings, (and) property, and the risk of major loss of life in such a highly populated part of the city was very high.'

The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion at Cliffe in Kent (the quarry before, left, and during, right) could be heard 10 miles away. These pictures show the devastating effects the bomb could have had if it was accidentally detonated in London

The authorities warned that 'remaining in your home is placing your life at significant risk' and residents were forced out of their homes on Monday night. 

Around 80 people were re-homed in hotels or empty council accommodation, while others had to sleep at houses of friends and family.

Hot meals and tea and coffee were provided for nearly 70 people at the Seven Islands Leisure Centre and Canada Water Library during the day.

Scotland Yard confirmed at around 6pm  that the area was deemed safe and residents could return to their homes. 

Residents were commended for their 'Blitz spirit' by local councillor Lucas Green, who referred to the residents as the 'evacuees of 2015', and said they had a mass phone charger swap', which was 'the modern day cup of sugar'.

Cllr Peter John, Leader of Southwark Council has thanked the emergency services, St Johns Ambulance and the Red Cross for their support at the rest centres. 

He added: 'Thankfully we don't have to deal with unexploded bombs very often, but we do have plans in place to deal with such emergencies, and they work. Once again I want to thank residents for their patience and co-operation while the army and police carried out their work.'

Dartford Police warned residents in Kent that there would be a loud explosion this morning but they needn't panic. 

The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion could be heard 10 miles (16km) away. 

Writing on Twitter, they said: 'EXPLOSION: Plz don't panic if you hear a loud bang... Army due to safely detonate a WWII UXB discovered in London yesterday.'

Residents reported hearing a loud bang after the explosion at around 9am claiming it 'rattled' houses.

Andy B posted on social media: 'Massive bang heard in Meopham, house shaken!!'.

On The Thames said: 'Judging by the massive bang and thud just then in Kent, I'd say the #Bermondseybomb is no more!'.

Residents were evacuated on Monady night after the 1,000lb German ordnance was discovered by builders under the old site of the Southwark Irish Pensioners. Pictured: Bomb disposal experts excavate the device

A bunker was built around the bomb by Royal Engineers of 33EOD to protect the surrounding buildings in case of accidental detonation. It was created from Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there
