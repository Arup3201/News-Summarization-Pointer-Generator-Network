Disney is in trouble.

No sooner had their Habit Heroes attraction - which tackles childhood obesity - opened at the popular Florida resort than it was abruptly closed 'for retooling'.

Epcot's new interactive exhibit has been blamed for stigmatizing and singling out fat children. Some parents called it 'horrifying and insensitive'

The official opening date was set to be March 5 and this has now been 'indefinitely postponed'.

A spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the health insurer which partnered with Disney to create the exhibit, said: 'Habit Heroes is currently in a 
soft-opening period, which gives us a chance to collect guest feedback 
and test and adjust the attraction prior to its opening.'

Inside the park's Innovations section, Habit Heroes features characters Will Buff and Callie Stenics. The animated fitness gurus take groups through each room where they teach about bad habits like watching too much television and eating junk food.

Cartoon villains include the super-sized Snacker, Sweet Tooth and Lead Bottom.

The heroes encourage children to destroy the 'baddies' using weapons such as fruit and vegetables to destroy unhealthy food.

The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance said: 'It appears that Disney now believes 
that using the tool of shame, favored so much by today's healthcare 
corporations, is the best way to communicate with children.

'Disney, in partnering with Blue Cross/Blue 
Shield, has taken the side of the bullies.'

John W. Herbkersman from Blue Cross/Blue Shield told the Orlando Sentinel: 'Our goal is to ensure that the 
attraction conveys a positive message about healthy lifestyles in a fun 
and empowering way.

'To work on further improving and
 refining the experience, the attraction is closed for the time being. 
We look forward to officially opening it soon.'

A message on the exhibits corresponding website says it is also closed for maintenance.

The founder of the Bariatric Medical Institute in Ottawa and family doctor Yoni Freedhoff, raised concerns about the new exhibit, posting on his blog: 'So thanks for being so helpful Disney. I mean if your kid is not overweight or obese, here’s to Disney reinforcing society’s most hateful negative obesity stereotyping, and if they are overweight or obese.

'What kid doesn’t want to be made to feel like a personal failure while on a Disney family vacation.

'A little Dance, Dance Revolution and 
some broccoli spears ought to clear everything up, right?

'Here's to Disney's reinforcing society's most hateful negative obesity 
stereotyping.'

Peggy Howell, also with the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, said: 'I was really disturbed to see the most negative habits were attached to really fat bodies.

'These pictures further the stigma against people of higher body weight.'

Disney spokeswoman Kathleen Prihoda said: 'That’s why we have a soft opening. So we can open it up to others and listen. We’ve heard the feedback.'
