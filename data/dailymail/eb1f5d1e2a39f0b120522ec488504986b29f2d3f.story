Paedophile BBC presenter Stuart Hall will be paid to attend classes to stop him being a sex offender.

The jailed TV host will be given £4 a week to go to the sessions where he will be asked to accept the damage he has done to his victims.

Attendance is compulsory, reports the Mirror, and if Hall doesn't go he could lose the right to early release. 

Jailed: Hall will attend courses in prison after he was jailed for a string of sex assaults against girls

The 83-year-old is serving his sentence at Wymott prison near Preston in Lancashire after he admitted a series of assaults against girls.

Wymott Prison is Category C and has 1,200 prisoners as well as four wings for sex offenders.

Hall is on I Wing which is reserved for elderly prisoners and as well as the Sex Offenders Treatment

Programme, which Hall will be paid to attend, the prison also offers a Victim Awareness Course.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Prisoners who take part in work, education or offending behaviour programmes receive a minimal amount but only if they participate in purposeful activity.'

Hall, who presented the popular show It's a Knockout between 1972 and 1982, admitted assaulting 13 girls between 1967 and 1986.

Last week, the former BBC Radio Five Live presenter faced new allegations of raping two girs, one aged 11, between 1976 and 1981.
