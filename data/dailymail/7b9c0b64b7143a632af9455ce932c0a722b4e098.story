As the US president's daughter, Sasha Obama has had to sit through her fair share of speeches.

So it was no surprise that the 11-year-old found her father's second inaugural address, well, a little tedious.

During the speech in Washington D.C. a television camera panned to Sasha as she sat beside her sister Malia, 14, and mother Michelle.

What a bore: Sasha Obama, left, sitting beside her older sister Malia, 14, and mother Michelle, was pictured yawning during her father's second inauguration speech in Washington D.C.

Sleepy: The 11-year-old was clearly not overly excited by her father's speech in front of 700,000 spectators

Admiration: Social networks became abuzz with users describing the yawn as the 'best part' of the speech, while some said the schoolgirl 'will be hearing about that yawn for the rest of her life'

But rather than looking as if she was hanging on her dad's every word, as he told the nation 'We’ll need to equip our children for the future', she appeared weary.

Despite letting out the huge yawn, Sasha still managed to diligently clap her father.

The schoolgirl can be forgiven for feeling tired after a gruelling day of preparation for the ceremony, beginning with an early-morning church service.

Social networks were immediately abuzz with admiration for the youngster.

One user wrote: 'Best part of the inauguration: Sasha's GIANT "Dad you're boring me" yawn.'

Rachel Mc said: 'Did Sasha just yawn? Love it! #kids', while another said that the schoolgirl would be 'hearing about the yawn for the rest of her life'.

While the speech in front of 700,000 spectators might not have been that gripping for the 11-year-old, her interest was certainly piqued when Beyoncé appeared before the family to sing the national anthem.

The sisters were also seen laughing and joking with their mother throughout the ceremony, while they also played with their mobile phones.

During the speech, the huge crowd heard 
Barack Obama say: 'I want to look out one more time because I'm not 
going to see this again.'

The president walked hand-in-hand with his wife as part of the Inauguration Parade, which featured floats from 60 organizations, as it snaked through the city's streets.

The parade came after Obama was sworn into office by Chief Justice John G. Roberts.

After he took the oath with two bibles - one belonging to Abraham Lincoln, the other to Martin Luther King Jr. - Obama addressed the crowd of supporters in an impassioned speech and urged the country to work together.

'We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few... We must act together, as one nation and one people,' he said.

'We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity... Let each of us now embrace, with solemn duty and awesome joy, what is our lasting birthright.

'With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history, and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.'
