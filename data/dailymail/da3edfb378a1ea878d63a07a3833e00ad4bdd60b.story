A young girl has scraped together her pennies and, with a little help from her parents, has bought the business she used to work in as a Saturday girl.

Molly Clegg, who is just 18, from Lincolnshire, has used her university fund to buy the jewellery store where she has been working at weekends for the past year.

She had just completed her A-levels and was considering going to university when the opportunity arose to take over Murano Silver in Market Deeping.

Molly, who has dreamt of working in the shop since she was a child, was thrilled when she managed to buy the business from her boss and is looking forward to a glittering career.

'The shop opened when I was 10 and I used to go in and buy earrings with my pocket money, then I managed to get a Saturday job there about a year ago,' said Molly.

'I had considered going to university, but I couldn't decide what to study and when the opportunity came up to buy the shop I knew it was what I really wanted to do.

'I feel incredibly lucky and love it so much, I don't feel I am missing out by not going to university. I'm learning a huge amount on the job.'

The money used to buy the shop was a combination of Molly's savings and ten years' worth of savings from her parents. Her father is an engineer and her mother is a housewife. The money was in a joint fund intended for university.

Molly bought the business name, domain name, assets, and is paying a lease on the shop.

Molly left school with four A-levels and has always been entrepreneurial. When she was 13 she started making bead necklaces and bracelets to sell to her friends.

She now sells her own designs, under the label Made by Molly, as well as classic silver pieces and unusual mixed metal jewellery.

'I have always loved jewellery and started making it out of kits when I was just six,' she said.

'As I go older I began designing my own and realised it was quite good, so I sold it to my friends.

'I love the fact that a piece of jewellery can change a whole outfit. You could wear a plain T-shirt but if you added a statement piece it could look completely different.'

Molly admits that running the shop is very different to working there as a Saturday girl and now has to meet with suppliers, order stock and monitor sales. But she is enjoying being her own boss.

'It was rather a shock at first and it has been hard getting to grips with all the spreadsheets, but I am getting there,' she said.

'There's obviously a lot more responsibility, but it's fun as I get to choose the stock, which I love.

'My parents have been very supportive and help me out when I get stuck. My friends all think it's great and are looking forward to seeing the shop when they're back from university.'

Molly said some of her suppliers have been surprised about her young age.

She added: 'I went to one showroom and they looked at me a bit puzzled, but I guess that's kind of understandable because not a lot of people my age are in my situation.'
