England's loss to South Africa on Friday exposed a host of deficiencies in Stuart Lancaster's line-up and will force some serious discussions about selections for Samoa this weekend and beyond.

Some of Stuart Lancaster's men stood up to be counted against the Springboks while others may have shown the coach enough to make him look elsewhere ahead of next year's World Cup.

Of the 15 starters on Saturday in the deceptively close 28-31 loss, here's who is safe, who is set for some sleepless nights and who has to make way for the good of the team.

Chris Robshaw leads England off the Twickenham pitch after their 28-31 loss to South Africa on Saturday

SAFE AS HOUSES

MIKE BROWN: Two sharp breaks and always full of intent with ball in hand. Defensively sound but would be good to see him at first receiver more. Match rating: 7/10

JOE MARLER: Another strong scrummaging display with the Harlequins prop to the fore. Consistent and one of the few rocks in the team. Must stay. 7

Harlequins prop Joe Marler is consistent and one the few rocks in Stuart Lancaster's team

DAVID WILSON: England cannot blame their set-piece forwards for their problems. Rock-solid scrummaging and carried well in both matches. Gets better with every Test match. 7

Also outstanding in the scrum, David Wilson crosses for a try after an excellent drive from England

DAVE ATTWOOD: Early knock-on against Boks put England on back foot and should have put Watson away for early try. Otherwise industrious and making an excellent impression. 7

Dave Attwood made some uncharacteristic errors but is making a big impression

COURTNEY LAWES: Huge questions over if he should have played after head knock against All Blacks. Lineout solid and work-rate high but looked tired. Could be rested against Samoans but would be on fitness, not form. 6

Courtney Lawes' work-rate and lineout work make him an asset and won't

SLEEPLESS NIGHTS

DYLAN HARTLEY: Lineout throws again exemplary and work in tight superb but blotted copybook with a brainless stamp that led to a yellow. Bath’s Rob Webber worth trying. 5

Dylan Hartley's strong work with the lineout and in tight was undone when he earned a yellow card

CHRIS ROBSHAW (capt): Honest and hard-working but does not seem to be inspiring his team. England were second best at breakdown again. Likely to play against Samoa but perhaps it should be at blindside. 6

Chris Robshaw is supposed to be leading the team as captain but they aren't even winning the breakdown

KYLE EASTMOND: Early knock-on set the tone for England’s wobbly opening and will be frustrated by lack of opportunities. Lacks a kicking game but merits consideration. 6

Kyle Eastmond's lack of a kicking game works against him but he can be dangerous when given a chance

JONNY MAY: What is the point in picking the Gloucester ace if he is hardly going to see the ball? Capable of individual brilliance but needs to get more involved. 6

If Jonny May isn't given the ball and a chance to use his blistering speed in space he shouldn't be picked

ANTHONY WATSON: Like Rokoduguni before him, England’s inside backs failed to release the Bath flyer. Not a bad first start by any means but if Rokoduguni is fit, he could return. 6

The inside backs are letting Anthony Watson down by not giving the Bath star early ball

BRAD BARRITT: Never anything other than committed and brave but questions over lack of creativity persist. Jonathan Joseph would offer a far greater attacking threat. 6

Brad Barritt's immense strength is his weakness with the fearless centre offering little creativity

ALMOST CERTAIN TO GO

OWEN FARRELL: (Subbed by Ford 63min) Looked rusty and short of fitness again. Kicking from hand is below par and isn’t getting the line going. George Ford is worth a shot. 5

Owen Farrell is short of fitness and struggling with his kicking ... George Ford's form warrants a shot

DANNY CARE: (Youngs 63) A 50th cap for the Harlequins No 9 will not be remembered as his finest. Lacked zip and pass was laboured. Youngs deserves another start. 5

Danny Care marked his 50th Test with a performance he'd prefer to forget

TOM WOOD: Carried well but gave away too many penalties and will be frustrated by breakdown work. England’s back row is getting outshone with alarming regularity and with James Haskell in form a change should be made. 6

With ball in hand Tom Wood impressed, but he gave away too many penalties and lacked at the breakdown

BILLY VUNIPOLA: (Morgan 44) His worst display in an England shirt. Carried valiantly but knocked on too often. Huge future but needs a break to improve his all-round game. Ben Morgan will start next week. 4

Billy Vunipola gave his worst performance for England and Ben Morgan will get his chance against Samoa
