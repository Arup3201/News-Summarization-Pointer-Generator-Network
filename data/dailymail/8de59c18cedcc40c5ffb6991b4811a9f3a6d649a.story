Over the last few years we've seen increasingly weird and innovative new uses being found for breast milk: women are selling their breast milk online; there's cheese churned from breast milk on sale - and even 'Baby Gaga' ice-cream made from expressed milk, created by gourmet company the Icecreamists.

And now there's soap. The bars - fashioned into rabbits, 
teddies and tortoises - are being sold online in China on e-commerce 
website Taobao by an anonymous mother.

The new mother in question came up with the concept when her son refused to breast feed,
 and, wanting him to still have some of the benefits, decided to mould 
the expelled milk into soap to rub on his skin.

While there is no medical benefit in rubbing the skin with breast milk, the unnamed mother found her soaps were popular with family and friends and decided to sell them online.

People have attempted to harness the benefits a mother's milk gives to her baby

This entrepreneurial move was so 
successful it has apparently prompted other mothers to follow suit, with
 one claiming to have sold over 300 bars on Taobao.

However,
 there has been a backlash from Chinese doctors against the growing fad,
 with Want China Times even claiming in their report that the soap could
 spread diseases if it came from a mother in poor health.

But this is not the first time people have attempted to harness the benefits a mother's milk gives to her baby.

Human breast milk has become a new luxury item for China's super-rich in recent years with firms even offering wet nurse services

China's super-rich are paying thousands of dollars a month for human breast milk, with some adults even choosing to be wet nursed.

The bizarre trend has seen a rise in adults buying breast milk and drinking it either straight from the breast or after it has been expressed.

According to the Southern Metropolis Daily, domestic staff agencies are offering wet nurses for newborns, sick people or anyone who will pay up to 16,000 yuan (£2,600) a month.

Customers say they want the concentrated nutrition breast milk provides.

It has a unique combination of antibodies, living cells, enzymes, hormones and fatty acids that has led some people to treat it as the latest superfood.

'Adult (clients) can drink it 
directly through breastfeeding, or they can always drink it from a 
breast pump if they feel embarrassed', Lin Jun, owner of company 
Xinxinyu that offers the service, was quoted as saying by AFP.

Critics say the practice turns a mother's milk into a commodity and cheapens the bond between mother and child.

In 2011, London outlet The Icreamists hit headlines around the world with their Baby Gaga ice-cream made from breast milk and served with a rusk.

Other countries take the supposed health benefits of breast milk very seriously.

Cancer patients, or those with digestive disorders or immune problems, can obtain breast milk on prescription in the U.S.

Breast Milk Cheese

In a move that has delighted some and disgusted others, in 2010 chef Daniel Angerer made cheese out of his wife's breast milk.

He claimed hte idea came to him after his wife gave birth and she began freezing her excess milk.

The chef began to experiment in using it to make cheese; aging it for a fortnight before testing it - and was amazed at its sweet taste.

Daniel even put the unusual cheese  on sale at the chef’s Klee Brasserie in New York where it could be enjoyed in dishes such as maple caramelized pumpkin seed encrusted cheese with concord grapes.

Breast Milk Jewellery

Mommy Milk Creations is selling pendants made from mothers' breast milk on Etsy.com, and they are proving a huge hit. So far founder Allicia Mogavero has sold over 250 items.

Allicia turns hardened breast milk into hearts, moons, flowers, stars and even tiny hands, and then adds sparkly gems to the finished product.

Costs range from between $69 to over $100 per piece (around £44 to £65).

Breast Milk Ice-cream

In 2011, London outlet The Icreamists
 hit headlines around the world with their Baby Gaga ice-cream made from
 breast milk and served with a rusk. 

Lactating mothers were recruited via an advert for suppliers on the Mumsnet forum and donated the milk for the sweet desert.

Each donor was given £15 for every ten ounces of milk extracted by pumps.
