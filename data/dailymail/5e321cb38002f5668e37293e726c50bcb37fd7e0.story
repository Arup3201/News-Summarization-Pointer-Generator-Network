The 'kill mission' against Islamic State boss Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi carries chilling echoes of TV show Homeland where the chief terror suspect Haissam Haqqani is supposedly killed in a drone attack.

In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson is very much alive, pulling the insurgent strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans.

I wonder if al-Baghdadi was doing the same. It would certainly suit him to play dead for a while - plus, he's risen from beyond the grave before.

Even now, the Pentagon is seeking to confirm whether coalition air strikes have critically injured or even managed to kill the elusive 'caliph'.

A scene from Channel 4 series Homeland after Haqqani was targeted by missile strikes on a farmhouse

This afternoon, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior announced: 'The leader of the ISIS group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdad has been transported to Syria after he was injured in an air strike that resulted in 40 casualties among ISIS militants. 

'The air strike targeted a meeting held between the ISIS leader and his key aides in an area near al-Kanadi school in al-Sa'ada district.'

'The leader of the group, known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been injured while his key aide Abu Huzayefa al-Adnani was reportedly killed. Senior leaders and experts in explosive devices were also killed in the attack including Omar al-Absi and Ahmed Salem al-Salmani, known as Abu Omar, the leader of Ashbal al-Jannah within the ISIS group.' But will his injuries make any difference to the terror group?

Normally so effusive on social media, ISIS are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend, though it has started arresting former members of the Iraqi army lest they are providing the US with actionable intelligence. It was telling too, that reports of his demise originally leaked out apparently from Isis sources.

ISIS is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed.

Baghdadi has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity, especially since his Al Qaeda mentor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. bombing raid in 2006. 

Except for his brief appearance in Mosul in July to proclaim himself Caliph (an office that fuses political and religious leadership), Baghdadi has kept a low profile, so that the fate of ISIS does not appear to hinge on his personal survival. 

It also offers the perfect cover should Baghdadi wish to disappear for a while, Homeland-style.

For Baghdadi has been careful to organize ISIS in such a way that power is highly decentralised, with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations.  

ISIS has been careful to include many Sunni tribal figures in administration, precisely to pre-empt any U.S. attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them, a strategy the Americans pursued against Al Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS's forerunner) in 2007-08 with some success. 

Targeted: Baghdadi was reportedly wounded on Friday night when American warplanes hit a ten-car ISIS convoy like this one southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS's capital in northern Iraq (file picture)

ISIS's military command includes at least two Sunni Muslim Iraqi army generals on the run since the Saddam era, who clearly have considerable tactical ability. 

ISIS has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres.

They also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing, and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their Iraqi or Kurdish opponents.  

So far, the U.S. response has been to remove the unpopular Shia prime minister of Iraq, to reduce the alienation of the country's Sunni and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the Iraqi national army, which, poorly led, effectively fled from this ferocious opponent. 

The only effective obstacles to ISIS taking over the country have been Shia militias in Baghdad and further south, and the Kurdish peshmerga in the north. 

Although the U.S. has added a further 1,500 military advisers, bringing their total strength to over 3000, they have to be careful since the same Shia militias are restive about a renewed U.S. 'occupation' of Iraq. 

American airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm. 

Taken out: According to Iraqi sources, parallel attacks on Qaim in Anbar province (above) killed one of the terror group's top strategists in a predominantly Sunni region where ISIS has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the world's attention was distracted by its relentless siege of Kobane in northern Syria

So far there have been an average of five strikes a day, compared with 50 in Libya in 2011, 85 in Afghanistan, and 800 a day in Iraq itself during the 2003 US-led invasion. 

So far, only 800 of the 3, 200 sorties over Iraq and Syria have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles. 

Until these raids at the weekend, there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground, while Pentagon lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties. 

The long distance planes have to fly from bases in Qatar or the UAE, or from carriers in the Persian Gulf, also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity.

So while it would be a significant blow to ISIS to lose its self-styled Caliph, he is replaceable in what in practice is a collective leadership with many experienced and hardened personalities.

Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq

Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group.

He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history.

But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world.

The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous.

This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'.

But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year.

Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam.

In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends.

But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation.

American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009.

He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast.

But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly.

After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.
