A church which has been 'cursed' by a plague of flies has been rendered unusable and could be demolished if a solution is not found.

The  evangelist Martin-Luther church has stood on the site  in Krumpendorf in Styria, in southern Austria, since 1969.

But three years ago, it was struck by an infestation of flies, forcing the congregation out.

It has become so bad that after pest control efforts failed, curator Helga Duffek and vicar Renate Mooshammer have even resorted to bringing in a team of ghost hunters and exorcists to the site, but all without success.

The evangelist Martin-Luther church in Krumpendorf in Styria, in southern Austria has been hit by a plague of flies

The church takes so long to clean before each service, at least two hours, that the congregation has left the building and now has to use a nearby catholic church in Krumpendorf.

Helga Duffek said: 'The church has been on the site since 1969 but suddenly in 2010 the was an infestation of flies – we called in the pest control and it didn't help at all, so we called several other pest control advisers but nobody was able to do anything.

'The pest control experts tried using gas, poison and a new technique known as high-temperature vaporisation.

'Every time within days the flies are back.'

Despite frequent cleaning away of dead flies they are still littered everywhere on the seats, on the floors and on the tables and alter while other living flies are seen buzzing around overhead.

Insect experts who have attempted to get to the bottom of the bizarre problem have identified five completely different species of flies infesting the church.

But they have been unable to explain why they are attracted to the church and why they keep returning. 

Vicar Renate Mooshammer joked: 'I can imagine this wonderful building offers not only plenty of room – but also peace. With one service per month, the flies aren’t exactly being disturbed.'

The church stands empty now the congregation has been forced to move.

There have not been any firm decisions made as to the future of the evangelist church building yet. If the national heritage agency agrees, it could be demolished or sold.

The head of the local monumental protection Association Gorazd Živkovic said they were considering lifting the status of the church so that it could be demolished because of the fly problem but admitted it was unlikely they would allow it to be knocked down immediately.
