Stonehenge attracts around one million visitors each year and now archaeologists have revealed that it was ‘the London of the Mesolithic’ – and even had an ancient ‘visitor’s centre’.

Ancient Britons from far and wide were drawn to Stonehenge to see the area’s pink flint and the River Avon acted as an ‘A-Road’ carrying people to a nearby settlement at Blick Mead where feasts and tour guides were available even before the monument was built, one archaeologist has claimed.

It is now thought that there was an established community in the area before the monument was built and that people travelled to the settlement in log boats.

An ancient tourist attraction: Ancient Britons from far and wide were drawn to Stonehenge to see the area¿s pink flint and the River Avon acted as an 'A-Road' carrying people to the location where feasts and tour guides were available, one archaeologist has claimed

It had long been thought Thatcham in Buckinghamshire was the oldest continuous settlement in the UK, but researchers have now bestowed the title on Amesbury in Wiltshire.

The location is home to Stonehenge and now holds the claim of being the birthplace of history in Britain - an honour confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records.

It is thought the settlement dates back more than 10 millennia to 8,820BC.

David Jacques of the University of Buckingham said:'The area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away, and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at Stonehenge itself. The first monuments at Stonehenge were built by these people'

Carbon dating of bones from giant bulls and boars discarded at Vespsian’s Camp, Blick Mead - a settlement around a mile from the monument - prove that Amesbury is the oldest settlement in Britain and has been continually occupied since 8,820BC.

Archaeologists think that the communities that built the monument lived and worked in the area for around 3,000 years and that Stonehenge was built as part of an established settlement, rather than a monument in an empty landscape.

They have also ruled out the possibility of the monument being built by European immigrants and think the giant stones were placed by indigenous hunters and homemakers.

The team found that Mesolithic cultures cleared land around Blick Mead between 7,500 and 4,600BC, which they had thought was an activity previously thought to be a part of the ‘farming package’ brought in by Neolithic immigrants from the continent in the 5th millennium BC.

Main attraction: Before Stonehenge was built there was a settlement on Blick Mead and people used the River Avon to access the community from the east and west (pictured), which is thought to have erected the famous stone monument

Archaeologists also recovered the largest haul of Mesolithic worked flints (some pictured) across the Mesolithic period ever found.  A total of 31,000 were discovered in an area measuring  52ft (16 square metres) 2,000 of which were concentrated in just a metre squared

The persistent use of the site for nearly 3,000 years and the fact that many of the tools found were for domestic purposes rather than hunting ones also points to the fact that people were settling there .Previously it was thought that there weren’t any settlers until Neolithic times.

David Jacques, research fellow in archaeology at the University of Buckingham, who led the dig, said that the site ‘provides evidence for people staying put, clearing land, building, and presumably worshipping, monuments.

‘The area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away, and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at Stonehenge itself. The first monuments at Stonehenge were built by these people.

Carbon dating from an archaeological dig has found the parish of Amesbury in Wiltshire has been continually occupied for every millennia since 8,820BC - making it the oldest settlement in the UK. These pieces of flint were found at the site on Vespasian's Camp, Blick Mead - a mile-and-a-half from Stonehenge

Historic: The dig in Amesbury, which took place in October and was funded by the University of Buckingham, also unearthed the largest haul of worked flints from the Mesolithic period

Experts from the University of Buckingham claim the new findings dismiss previous theories that Amesbury, marked at A, was conceived by European immigrants. 'In effect, Blick Mead (near the settlement) was the very first Stonehenge Visitor Centre, up and running in the 8th millennium BC,' one archaeologist said

‘In effect, Blick Mead was the very 
first Stonehenge Visitor Centre, up and running in the 8th millennium 
BC. The River Avon would have been the A-Road – people would have come 
down on their log boats.

‘They would have had the equivalent of tour guides and there would have been feasting.’

The settlement was confirmed using carbon dating on bones that belonged to aurochs - animals once twice the size of bulls, illustration pictured

The team of archaeologists found remains
 of big game animals and a large amount of burnt flint from their 
feasting fires as well as tools that suggest people travelled to the 
site from the east and west.

‘Another possible reason why people were attracted to the area was the striking bright pink colouring of the flint, which isn’t that colour anywhere else in the country,’ he said.

The pink colour of the flint was caused by Hildenbrandia rivularis algae and is due to a combination of dappled light and the unusually warm spring water in the area.

Dr Jacques said: ‘It’s unique to have people of that time come from so many different faraway places. The site and the Stonehenge areas were very well known places to visit for a very long time – the London of the Mesolithic.’

Archaeologists also recovered the largest haul of Mesolithic worked flints across the Mesolithic period ever found. 

A total of 31,000 were discovered in an area measuring  52ft (16 square metres) 2,000 of which were concentrated in just a metre squared.
