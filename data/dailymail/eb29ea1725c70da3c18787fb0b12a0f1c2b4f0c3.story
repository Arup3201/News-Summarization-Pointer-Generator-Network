The body of Emylee Lonczak was found in shrubbery between two homes on Madrillon Estates Drive in Vienna on Friday morning

The death of a 16-year-old girl whose body was found in a bush has been ruled an accident causes by drugs, according to the state medical examinerâ€™s office.

Emylee Lonczak was reported missing August 21 from her home in an affluent area of McLean, Virginia.

Two days later, her body turned up in the bushes between a pair of million-dollar homes in the well-heeled suburb of Vienna.

Today it was reported her death was caused by the adverse effects of heroin and an over-the-counter antihistamine.

According to a search warrant obtained by The Washington Post, the McLean High School student left home August 21 with two men and then drove out of state to buy drugs from another man.

Members of the group then used the drug, before returning to Fairfax County in the early hours of August 22 after realizing the teen was in medical distress, but did not seek help, the document stated.

No charges have been filed in the case.

Police investigating Lonczak's death had previously interviewed one of the teen's companions, identified by NBC Washington as 19-year-old Kyle Alifom, and searched his parents' Vienna home

Probe: Police determined that one of the men Emylee (left) was with before her death was Kyle Alifom (right), 19, who told officers that he and the 16-year-old drank beer and smoked marijuana that night .

Alifom,
who attends Marshall High School, reportedly told officials that hours 
before the girl died, he and Emylee attended a party together where they
drank beer and smoked marijuana.

Alifom later got a ride with the girl to his home in Vienna, where Lonczak remained for several hours before taking her leave on foot.

On August 23, police bloodhounds picked up Emylee's scent in the Tysons Corner area of Vienna, and quickly tracked down her body left in the shrubbery between two homes.

According to online records, Alifom has had at least two run-ins with the law. Most recently, he was arrested in March on a public drunkenness charge.

A year before, Alifom was collared on a count of alcohol possession.
