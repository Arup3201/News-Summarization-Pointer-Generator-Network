A pedestrian bridge in Brooklyn has had to be shut down because it's too bouncy.

The zigzagging, 450-foot Squibb Park Bridge connecting the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood to Brooklyn Bridge Park will be closed until spring.

The bridge opened in the spring of last year and was intended to bounce gently — but the motion has become more pronounced over time.

The bridge is a beloved spot for Brooklyn Heights residents. Some are miffed that it will take city officials some eight months to fix the construction

Brooklyn's Squibb Park Bridge was always meant to bounce gently, but engineers say the motion has become too pronounced

The bridge was closed for repairs in August. 

Park officials announced Friday that the bridge would remain closed while engineers study the problem.

'At this point, because of the movement we notice, it would be overly optimistic to say we could solve this in two to three weeks,' Regina Myer, who heads the nonprofit Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation, told the New York Times.

'We need to fully understand the bridge — and we want the public to know that we are really erring on the side of caution,' she added to the newspaper.

The Squibb Park Bridge cost $5 million. It was a long-awaited addition to Brooklyn Heights.

Some local residents were bummed out to hear their bridge would be closed for so long.

'It’s a bummer,' mother-of-three Susannah Drake, of Brooklyn Heights, told the Times. 

'I love the bridge. It feels like you’re out in the wilderness on an adventure, and here we are in the middle of Brooklyn.'
