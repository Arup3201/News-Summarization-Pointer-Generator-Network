The world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier has been retired from active service in the U.S. Navy having served longer than any other U.S. aircraft carrier.

At 1,123 ft, the ‘Big E’ was the longest naval vessel in the world, she weighed 94,781 tonnes and was home to a crew of some 4,600 people.

When she was first built in the early 1960s, the Enterprise was meant to be the first of a class of six, but construction costs ballooned and the remaining vessels were never laid down.

Enterprise is the second oldest commissioned vessel in the United States Navy, after the wooden-hulled, three-masted frigate USS Constitution.

The USS Enterprise (CVN-65), the eighth United States naval vessel to bear the name. She was originally scheduled for decommissioning in 2014 or 2015, depending on the life of her reactors and completion of her replacement, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78).

Her final deployment, the last before her decommissioning, began on 10 March 2012 and ended 4 November 2012.

Enterprise is the only aircraft carrier to house more than two nuclear reactors. She is also the only carrier with four rudders, two more than other classes, and features a more cruiser-like hull.

The USS Enterprise ended its notable 51-year career on Saturday during a ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.

Thousands of former crew members, ship builders and their families lined a pier to bid farewell to one of the most decorated ships in the Navy.

The ship had served in every major conflict since participating in a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In October 1962, following revelations that the Soviet Union was constructing nuclear missile launch sites on Cuba, President John F. Kennedy ordered the United States Department of Defense to conduct a large-scale buildup.

President Kennedy ordered a naval and air blockade on shipment of offensive military equipment to Cuba, and demanded the Soviets dismantle the missile sites there.

Four United States Second Fleet carriers participated in the blockade - Enterprise (as part of Task Force 135), Independence, Essex, and Randolph, backed by shore-based aircraft.

By 28 October, the crisis was averted, after the US secretly agreed to remove nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey.

In the late 60s, early 70s the carrier was involved in the Vietnam war and the aftermath. More recently been the carrier has involved in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

With the inactivation, the U.S. fleet is temporarily reduced to 10 aircraft carriers while the USS Gerald R. Ford is built. It will join the fleet in 2015.

The Enterprise was a principal setting of the Tom Cruise 1986 blockbuster Top Gun. Director Tony Scott filmed actual flight operations aboard ship and incorporated them into the film's plot.

Also in 1986, Enterprise was a setting of scenes in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The ship was unavailable for filming, so scenes depicting Enterprise were again filmed aboard USS Ranger.

More important for Star Trek lore, the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was the inspiration for the naming of the Starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701).

80's movies including Star Trek 4 and Top Gun featured the Enterprise
