The odds of cracking open an egg and finding a double yolk inside of finding a double are believed to be around 1,000/1.

So chef Ross Cruickshanks might be tempted to buy a lottery ticket after an extraordinary run that saw him crack open 19 ‘double yolkers’ in a row while cooking breakfast at a Scottish café.

Mr Cruickshanks was rustling up breakfasts for diners at Café Riva by Nardini in North Ayrshire when he broke open six of the unusual double yolk eggs in succession last week - a feat in itself believed to have a one in a trillion chance of happening.

Amazed waitresses took the first six to waiting customers, only for the chef to find double yolks in the next 13 eggs he cracked on to his grill at the café in Inverkip, Inverclyde, last week.

Staff snapped pictures of the bizarre coincidence and posted them on the restaurant’s Facebook page.

The post added: ‘Ross has just made three breakfasts with SIX double yolkers in a row – that’s odds of more than a TRILLION to one!’

When the chef went on to crack open more than a dozen more, staff added: 'Ok now it’s getting unreal, another 13 in a row!'

The run 
continued at the café last week, with kitchen staff cracking open 
another 10 double yolkers on Thursday and 10 more on Friday, according 
to café owner Alessandro Nardini.

'I've
been researching it a bit myself and it's supposed to be lucky to find a
double yolk, so I've put on a lottery ticket for this week,' Mr Nardini
said.

Mr Nardini said 
the cafe's egg supplier, C&G Eggs in Greenock, use vans emblazoned 
with the fitting slogan: 'Need a Yolk? I'm Your Bloke'.

Chef
Ross, from Skelmorlie in North Ayrshire, is studying sport and physical activity at Strathclyde 
University in Glasgow. He has been working part-time in the kitchen at Cafe
Riva since March.

A spokeswoman for the British Egg Information Service said cracking open 19 double yolks in a row was 'very impressive indeed'.

'The chances of getting a double yolk are estimated to be less than one in 1,000, so this is pretty rare,' she said.

The spokesman added: 'Egg yolks contain all kinds of vitamins and minerals and studies recently showed that they contain more nutritional value than was previously thought,'
