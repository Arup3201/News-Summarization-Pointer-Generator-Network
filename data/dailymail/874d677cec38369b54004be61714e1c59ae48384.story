Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years for a string of sex offences. The IPCC is now investigating claims police failed to take action on reports about him

Eight police officers are being investigated over claims they failed to take action to stop paedophile rockstar Ian Watkins, it emerged today.

The officers from three separate forces across Britain are being probed after claims some of them were told about the Lostprophets frontman before he attempted to rape a baby.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is now looking into reports police failed to act on the information.

The watchdog is investigating South Wales Police - who cover Watkins' home town of Pontypridd.

They are also looking at South Yorkshire Police and Bedfordshire Police, who cover the home area of two women said to have 'offered' their children to Watkins.

The IPCC have already served notices on three South Yorkshire Police officers - one sergeant and two police constables - advising them that their conduct is subject to investigation.

A fourth officer - another constable at South Yorkshire Police - has now been served with a misconduct notice.

The officers are being investigated after complaints about the handling of three reports made to the force between March and May 2012 which contained 'potential evidence'. 

A sergeant and a constable at Bedfordshire Police are also being probed over their 'handling of information from a member of the public' in October 2012.

A detective constable from South Wales Police's Child Protection Unit is also being investigated.

Another detective sergeant in South Wales has already been served with a gross misconduct notice and removed from frontline duty.

Announcing the investigation into the latest officer, a spokesman for the watchdog said: 'The IPCC has served a misconduct notice on a South Yorkshire Police constable as part of its ongoing investigation into the force's handling of information about Ian Watkins in 2012.

'Three South Yorkshire Police officers served with gross misconduct notices have already been interviewed by IPCC investigators. An interview with the fourth officer will take place in the near future.'

At least one of the reports about Watkins (pictured on stage the V Festival in 2011) is said to have been made before he tried to rape a baby in London in 2012

The police watchdog said it has received a substantial amount of information from the three forces involved, which is being analysed by investigators.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission Commissioner Jan Williams said: 'We are making good progress with our three independent investigations.

'We are continuing to gather and analyse information to establish what steps were taken by police in response to the allegations made against Ian Watkins.

'And whether he could have been brought to justice sooner and whether his celebrity status had any impact on those investigations.'

The IPCC is looking at the 'effectiveness of the response to reports of abuse' - after claims Watkins was reported to police as early as 2008.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how Watkins attempted to rape baby in a hotel room in Shepherds Bush, London, in April 2012.

The singer was jailed for 35 years last year after admitting a string of sex offences.
