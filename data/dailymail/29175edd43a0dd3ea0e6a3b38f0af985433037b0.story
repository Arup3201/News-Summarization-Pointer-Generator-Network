These dazzling optics were created using nothing more than some homemade torches and a camera.

Light artist Ian Hobson waves lights in a formation whilst capturing the movement through time using long exposure photography.

The former lecturer in neuropharmacology and computing at Newcastle University creates his tools by adapting mains powered light sources for portable battery packs.

The striking results are not photo-manipulated in any way.

Dazzling objects: Light artist Ian Hobson's work entitled Rural Railway

Mr Hobson first painted the night sky in 1980s but re-kindled his passion after advances in digital photography.

Mr Hobson, from Wallsend, North Tyneside, said: 'The main attraction is the fun. It's very enjoyable jumping about waving lights, then rushing back to the camera to see what was captured by the sensor.

'But the technical and cognitive challenge is also a big part of the attraction, as there are so many variables to be juggled.

'It takes a lot of concentration, making a successful effort all the more rewarding.

The 44-year-old employs recurrent motifs in his art, inspired by his previous studies of neurology and prehistoric rock carvings.

He said: 'On one level, it's all very cerebral and abstract, in that I'd like the images and their mode of creation to be able to say something about the relationship between human cognition and space and time, but on another level I simply like making bonny patterns.

A work entitled 'Middle engine orb and self' by light artist Ian Hobson, made using LEDs spun on a wire, handheld LED strip with off camera flash and LEDs mounted on sunglasses, in a pedestrian underpass below a dual carriageway

A work entitled 'Culvertising' by light artist Ian Hobson, made using handheld LED strips and cold cathode tubes in an underground culvert

Mr Hobson took this using LEDS mounted on a bike wheel rolled inside concrete drainage

This image was made using handheld LEDs with perspex diffusers inside a concrete drainage pipe

'In an age where computers can generate images that look like reality, I also get satisfaction from creating imagery that are reality looking like computer generated images.

'The lack of post processing in my light paintings hopefully raises some questions about the way in which our perception of the real world can be skewed by digital manipulation of images.'

Mr Hobson's nocturnal light-beaming activities have been cause for concern for many people stumbling across him whilst painting the skies.

A work entitled 'Antimatter Replacement Unit' by light artist Ian Hobson, features LEDs with perspex diffuser swung on a string above a cheesegrater mounted on the camera lens

He said: 'I have had people ask me if I am performing some obscure kind of martial art, when shooting by rivers or by the sea.

'People have asked how on earth I expect to catch any fish with all those LEDs attached to the rod, on some occasions people will come over and ask what I'm up to, and this has resulted in them featuring in some of the shots.

'On one occasion, the images on the camera's screen persuaded members of the constabulary that despite me waving a power drill bedecked with flashing lights, I was in fact harmless.'
