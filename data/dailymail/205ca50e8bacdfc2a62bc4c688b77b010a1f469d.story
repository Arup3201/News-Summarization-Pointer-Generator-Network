The selfie is here to stay - whether you hate them or are an enthusiastic participant.

And while the self-portrait snap is a relatively recent online obsession, gaining popularity as social media became a part of daily life, this man was an early adopter.

YouTuber 'Dumo' has been taking a selfie every day for the past eight years, and last month uploaded a video compiling all 2,900 pictures online, creating a  'life montage'.

Life montage: Youtube 'Dumo' has taken a selfie everyday for eight years, and compiled 2,900 in a video

The video, entitled 'Picture of My Face Every Day for 8 Years' has gone viral, gaining more than 192,000 hits in less than a month.

The montage shows Dumo growing from fresh-faced  into fatherhood, gradually losing his youthful chubby cheeks, gaining a more defined jawline and changing hairstyle several times.

A wife and babies make cameo appearances throughout the video, as do some holiday tans, costumes and facial injuries.

Clearly a stickler for continuity, Dumo carefully changes his position in each picture so it appears he is gradually moving around his house throughout the three-minute video. 

Baby-faced: Dumo began the project in 2006 and stuck to it with remarkable dedication

Fashion critics: Viewers have commented on his changing appearance and sartorial choices over the years, including this unpopular necklace, which he sported for several years

In the description, Dumo jokes that he made the video for his children - 'and they can't do anything to stop me.'

'Not sure what's up with my murder death stare,' he muses, in reference to his subdued expression throughout. 'That's actually just my relaxed face.'

He discusses some viewers' comments on his appearance, such as his unpopular necklace, and hairstyle, apparently described as 'a pineapple' or 'dancing spiders'.

Dumo adds that he has been compared to actors Jerry O'Connell and Leonardo DiCaprio.
