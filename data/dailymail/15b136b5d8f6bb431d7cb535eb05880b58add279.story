Beleaguered: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp could be at the centre of fresh corruption allegations after the FBI allegedly began investigating a Russian firm it used to own

The FBI is reportedly investigating whether a Russian billboard company once owned by Rupert Murdoch's media giant News Corp bribed local officials to get their signs in the best positions.

Two sources familiar with the investigation said it it will examine operations at former News Corp subsidiary News Outdoor Russia, according to the Associated Press.

The alleged investigation appears to have grown out of the phone hacking scandal, which revealed that journalists at Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World obtained exclusives by illegally listening to private messages.

The two people spoke about the alleged Russian probe on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the investigation. 

The story was reported by Fox News, part of Fox Entertainment, which is owned by News Corp.

News Corp sold its majority stake in NOR in July, but the alleged investigation opens another legal battlefield for the New York-based media group.

Murdoch's empire is trying to contain the damage from the hacking scandal at News International newspapers News of the World and The Sun as well as from allegations of bribes paid to police and other officials.

Sources said FBI investigators are trying to establish whether overseas units of News Corp engaged in corrupt acts or bribery, and, if so, whether those acts were part of a pattern, according to the Wall Street Journal, which is also owned by News Corp.

News Corp has said it is cooperating with the UK investigations.

Asked if NOR employees engaged in bribery or other acts of corruption while it was a subsidiary of News Corp, a spokesman for the Russian company said: 'This is not possible'.

He added: 'News Outdoor Russia was an investment project for News Corp and [News Corp] didn't participate in the operations of the company.'

A News Corp spokeswoman declined to comment on the FBI probe in Russia, or to say if the media giant had provided any information to U.S. investigators about the Russian business.

Federal prosecutors and the FBI have yet to reach any conclusions about the Russian affair, according to the people familiar with the U.S. investigation.

The U.S. probe began in July to investigate a media report that UK-based employees of News Corp newspapers may have hacked the phone messages of 9/11 victims and their families.

Investigators have not found any evidence to support that claim, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation, but investigators have apparently since begun probing possible bribery in Britain and Russia.

In written responses to WSJ questions, NOR said it had not been contacted by the FBI and was not aware of such an investigation.

'Over the entire history of the company's activities, both before the alliance with News Corp. and after the sale to the strategic investor, NOR conducted its business within Russian law,' a company spokesman said.

NOR was a profitable property for News Corp, which had a majority holding in the Moscow-based billboard company for a decade, until it sold its 79 per cent stake last July.

NOR benefited from a burgeoning Russian consumer sector and buildings in big cities wallpapered with ads, becoming one of the largest outdoor-ad companies in Russia.

Head of the company Maxim Tkachev was shot outside his office in 2002. He survived the shooting, which occurred months after an executive at a chief rival to NOR, Vladimir Kanevsky, was shot dead at a Moscow intersection. No one was convicted in either case.

Two people familiar with the probe said the FBI is looking into the murder of Mr Kanevsky to see if it was connected to any possible corruption at NOR, but they cautioned that it may be difficult to learn anything about the decade-old killing. Mr Tkachev declined to speculate on the shootings.

The company later became mired in a tax dispute with Russia's federal tax authorities that it eventually lost. In 2008, News Outdoor Russia's offices were raided by Russian anti-corruption authorities investigating a Moscow city official. NOR was not accused of wrongdoing in that case.

That same year, News Corp's Mr. Murdoch made clear he had soured on his investment in Russia. On an earnings call in August 2008, he said that the more successful it was, the higher the likelihood the business would be 'stolen' - but did not say by whom.

News Corp valued NOR at more than $1billion when it first began looking to sell it in 2007, though that was before the financial crisis and resulting drop in ad sales. News Corp sold its holding in NOR last July for $270 million.

Some multinationals, including Daimler AG and Pinalpina World Transport (Holding) Ltd, have fallen foul in Russia of a U.S. law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits entities with U.S. operations from paying bribes to officials overseas.

In such cases authorities quickly expand the probe to the company's conduct around the globe.

If the FBI find that News Corp engaged in acts of corruption or bribery through NOR, the company could face potential liability even though it no longer owns NOR, lawyers said.

The Moscow advertising market is widely suspected of being riddled with corruption, though recent attempts have been made to clean it up.

A key factor is the influence of city or state officials in making decisions on prime advertising sites, laying them open to bribery.

Sources in Russia say that Rupert Murdoch felt uneasy with News Outdoor long before he sought to sell the business, a deal that went through last year.

He made clear his strong desire to unload the Russian operation, evidently feeling uneasy in Moscow compared with China.

'The more I read about investments in Russia the less I like the feel of it. The more successful we'd be in Russia the more vulnerable we'd be to have the business stolen from us, so there we sell now,' he said.

Earlier he had got rid of stakes in Russian radio stations Nashe Radio and Ultra.

Damaged reputation: The hacking scandal led to the demise of News Corp paper News of the World and is threatening the image of The Sun following journalists' arrests

The sale of News Outdoor took place in July last year and the company was purchased by a pool of investors including Russian giants  VTB Capital and  Alfa Capital Partners.

When he sold, News Outdoor owned 50,000 advertising spaces in 85 cities. Its business has suffered during the economic crisis with revenues plunging to 2.5billion roubles from 4.5 billion in 2009.

In 2008, work at News Outdoor was paralysed by a raid from by Interior Ministry investigators probing financial documents amid suggestions of a bitter conflict between the company and the Moscow authorities.

At the time, company officials said they were victims of 'unscrupulous competition'.

In the murky and lucrative world of advertising in Moscow - where the city's potential is seen as untapped compared with New York or London - there are many illegal advertising sites giving them impression of an uncontrolled market.

While details have not been disclosed of the FBI probe, the advertising market in Moscow is no stranger to legal actions.

Last year Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin fired the head of the Moscow advertising committee Vladimir Makarov who was earlier arrested over abuse of office allegations.

Investigators accused him in 2009 of illegally doling out at least 131m roubles ($4.3m) in discounts to private companies in the city.

Makarov's underling Igor Gavrilov was also arrested the same year on charges of accepting a 3.25 million ruble bribe from the head of a private company for prolonging city advertising contracts. Gavrilov served three-and-a-half years in jail for extortion.

Makarov spent six months in custody and was released pending further investigations in February 2010.
