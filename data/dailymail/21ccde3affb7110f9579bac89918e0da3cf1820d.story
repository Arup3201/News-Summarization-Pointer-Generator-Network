A Philadelphia man has been charged with stabbing a member of Nikki Minaj's tour crew to death during an argument over a barmaid.

Pierce Boykin was charged with the murder of 29-year-old De'Von Pickett on Tuesday, Homicide Captain James Clark confirmed.

Pickett - who was Minaj's tour manager - was stabbed to death in the early hours of Wednesday, February 18, outside a bar in Philadelphia.

Charged: Pierce Boykin, 31, (left) was charged with the murder and attempted member of members of Nicki Minaj's (right) tour crew - who had arrived in Philadelphia for rehearsals for the singer's upcoming tour 

He and the rest of the crew had just arrived in the city to rehearse for Minaj's tour, which is supposed to begin in Europe this month. 

Fellow crew member Eric Parker, 27, was also stabbed in the attack, but was expected to survive his injuries. 

Boykin, 31, was originally charged with attempted murder of Parker, but Clark says the murder charge was tacked on after additional evidence pointed to Boykin for both stabbings. 

According to NBC 10, the argument began inside Che Bar & Grill in Philadelphia’s West Oak Lane neighborhood.

'We believe that both of the victims, as well as the perpetrator, were all inside of this bar and that’s when an argument started,' said Chief inspector Scott Small.  

Boykin is in custody, and an attorney for him could not be reached to comment on the charges.
