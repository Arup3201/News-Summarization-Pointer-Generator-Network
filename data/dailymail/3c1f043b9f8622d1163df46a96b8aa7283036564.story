The opulent, five star Ritz Paris is closing its doors for two years for a €140 million renovation.

Once the hotel of choice for Charlie Chaplin, Coco Chanel and Princess Diana, it will close on Wednesday after it failed to win France’s coveted ‘palace’ top luxury destination.

Owned by Egyptian tycoon Mohamed Al Fayed, the 114-year-old landmark hotel is in dire need of revamp, industry insiders say.

Closing its doors: Ritz Paris will close tomorrow for two years for a 140 million Euro renovation which includes the refurbishment Coco Chanel suite (pictured) and its other 159 rooms

Vanguelis Panayotis, head of development at the MKG Group hospitality consultancy said: ‘It was a waste to see a hotel with such a location, with such a history, in a state like this.

‘To justify this kind of price, you really have to offer quality on a par with the competition.’

With cables hanging down in full view from its flat screen televisions and ageing elevators and dumbwaiters, a Ritz spokeswoman admitted the hotel has some sprucing up to do to match the competition.

For closing night tonight, chef 
Michel Roth has put on a special €240 menu with dishes such as foie gras, blue lobster 
in raspberry vinaigrette with caviar and the Ritz's signature peach 
melba.

The
hotel was virtually booked out for Monday night, mostly to regulars, 
for prices ranging from €850 to €10,000 for the Coco Chanel suite.

The refurbishment, which will last until mid 2014, includes fitting out its 160 rooms with the ‘latest technology’ and a new garden restaurant.

All the bedrooms will be redecorated but they would stay traditional in style, in its trademark tones of pink, almond green, yellow and sky blue the spokeswoman said.

Like the rest of the luxury industry, the high end hotel sector is booming thanks to demand from emerging markets. Paris has also seen US clients flood back to take advantage of a weaker Euro.

Two state-of-the-art Asian luxury hotels opened in the French capital in 2010, the Shangri-La and the Mandarin Oriental, raising the stakes for historic players like the Ritz.

Another established Paris hotel, the nearby Crillon, is closing for renovations in the autumn.

The Bristol and Meurice hotels have already had face-lifts, the Plaza-Athenee is working on an extension, and the Royal Monceau underwent a full refurbishment under its new Qatari ownership from 2008 to 2010.

Founded in 1898 by Cesar Ritz and the chef Auguste Escoffier, the Ritz is home to L'Espadon restaurant, holder of two Michelin stars and the Ritz-Escoffier cooking school.

The Ritz's 460 employees have all been promised their jobs back after the renovation. In the meantime, 320 have taken up a generous severance package offered by the hotel.

Chef Roth will keep working for the Ritz as an ambassador, promoting it to rich clients in Asia and around the world, and the hotel hopes much his team will return once the hotel reopens.

The hotel spokeswoman said: ‘Many of the kitchen staff have found other employment, but most have said they want to come back to the Ritz. 

‘It's a very close-knit team.’
