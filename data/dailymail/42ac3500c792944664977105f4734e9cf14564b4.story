A former NFL star and his new bride are calling it quits.

Jennifer Conrad has filed papers to end her marriage to Keyshawn Johnson just seven months after she and the wide receiver said 'I do' in an intimate beachfront wedding ceremony.

This also comes three months after one man claimed that Johnson was having an affair with his model wife.

TMZ reports that Conrad claimed the pair separated back in February and is citing irreconcilable differences as the reason behind the split. 

She is asking for primary custody of the couple's two children, 5 and 2, and notes in the papers that she did sign a prenuptial agreement.

Johnson and Conrad's wedding was a four-day celebration that spared no expense last August in Newport Beach, California, with the ceremony taking place at the swank St. Regis hotel.

Then, in December, a man came forward alleging Johnson had been having an affair with his wife.

Brian Holloway sought an annulment after claiming his wife, Alicia Tarry, was having an affair with Johnson just six months after they were married. 

Holloway claimed he went through his wife's Twitter direct messages, and found numerous exchanges between her and Johnson, including a request for a graphic nude photo.

'Send me a p**** shot,' one direct message says.

'I'll get one in a few sorry have a guest over,' the other person responds.

Tarry says she did not have an affair with Johnson, and that these messages were 'illegally obtained.'

Johnson seems to echo this statement, with a source saying he has 'no idea what the guy's talking about.'

Johnson, who played for the New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys and Carolina Panthers before retiring in 2007 to become an analyst and enjoy a very brief stint on Dancing With the Stars, is said to still be trying to repair his marriage with Conrad and get her back.
