A breakdown mechanic fixed a 50-year-old Land Rover with a potato.

AA patrolman Mario Papademetriou made the ingenious repair after being called out to a farm in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.

Initially, he tried to fix the broken condenser on the 1960s vintage Land Rover using tin foil and silicone repair tape, but this failed.

Mr Papademetriou, 59, from Chingford, Essex, said: 'As the vehicle was on a farm, there were a lot of vegetables around, so I thought I'd try wiring up a potato with a couple of screws to act as a condenser.

'Amazingly, it started instantly, so I followed the owner to the garage and he said the vehicle had never driven so well!'

The owner made the 12-mile journey to the garage where the ignition system was properly repaired.

Mr Papademetriou's ingenuity saw him win the AA's annual competition for most innovative roadside repair.

AA technical director, Donald MacSporran, said: 'AA patrols work on pretty much any vehicle on the road and pride themselves on their ability to fix them.

'While they regularly go the extra mile with some very inventive repairs, we continue to invest in their training and equipment to maintain our leading fix rate.

'Although vegetables are best left on the dinner plate, Mario's use of a potato was definitely a chip above the others - an excellent example of thinking outside the box.'
