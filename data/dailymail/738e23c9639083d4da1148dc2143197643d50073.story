It was a bust in more than one sense of the word.

Footage has emerged of Arkansas officers pursuing and arresting a naked female who was running through a parking lot.

The incident led to the phrase ‘tripping balls’ being used possibly for the first time ever in a police report.

Naked ambition: Melissa Valencia, 21, is filmed by a police unit streaking through a parking lot in Fayetteville

Giving chase: Valencia made a concerted to evade capture

Charged: Valencia was booked for misdemeanor public intoxication and resisting arrest

On the evening of July 1 police in Fayetteville received a call from a member of public who said that a naked woman ‘intoxicated on drugs and “tripping balls”’ was running around the town center.

Two squad cars were dispatched, with the woman in question, later named as 21-year-old Melissa Valencia, filmed on an in-car camera.

At the start of the footage she is seen running away from the police units and an officer giving chase on foot.

The clip then shows her struggling with officers as they try to arrest her.

A police report about the incident seen by The Smoking Gun website said: ‘I was dispatched to the area of Church and Center for a naked female running down Center Street. The caller stated she was intoxicated on drugs and "tripping balls".

Resisting arrest charge: Officers claim that Valencia screamed and kicked her legs when they tried to detain her

I observed a naked female, later identified as Melissa Valencia running through the parking lot of this intersection... Valencia ran approximately 75 feet to a pole in the parking lot and appeared to be attempting to hide from me. Valencia was speaking but was not making any sense. While attempting to handcuff her, Valencia pulled away and was thrashing her arms about.'

The report noted that Valencia screamed and kicked her legs while on the ground.

She was taken to Washington Regional Medical Center and treated for a possible drug overdose. A nurse later told the officer who filed the report that Valencia had admitted to 'taking acid at her boyfriend's house'.

The officer noted that the following day she was 'calm, polite and cooperative'.

She was charged with misdemeanor public intoxication, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges.

According to the urban dictionary, 'tripping balls' means 'being under the influence of a substance that is extremely altering your mental and/or spiritual state'.

Its exact origins are unknown, but some say it was coined as a result of bouncy balls being used by LSD users to help them connect with reality.

It's been in popular use in America since the mid-1980s, with the phrase seeping into popular films, TV shows and books over the years.

On hit animation American Dad Roger the alien sings a song called 'Trippin' Balls' in an episode when the characters visit a theme park. It's also been used on a variety of occasions on South Park.

It's thought that the earliest broadcast of the phrase was in 2004 comedy film Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle.
