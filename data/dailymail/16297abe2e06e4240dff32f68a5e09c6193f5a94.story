David Traill, 51, was a Chinook instructor at RAF Odiham where Prince William was taught

The war hero pilot who died in the Glasgow helicopter tragedy is thought to have been one of Prince William’s flight instructors.

David Traill, 51, was a Chinook instructor at the Hampshire base where the Duke of Cambridge learned how to fly five years ago.

The former flight lieutenant, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq with the RAF, was an ‘extremely experienced’ pilot who had won medals for his bravery.

Mr Traill, from Lochwinnoch, leaves behind three devastated nephews who he cared for after their father died three years ago.

He regularly visited nephews David, Jamie and Max, who live with their mother Mary in Bathgate.

Cousin Toni Lawson, 25, said: ‘His younger brother Angus died three years ago from throat cancer, which knocked him for six.

‘Since then he’s helped raise his three young nephews.

'Their mum will have a hard time explaining to the boys what has happened to their uncle.

'They will be completely distraught about this.’

Miss Lawson added: ‘As long as I’ve been alive, he’s been flying helicopters. When he was in the RAF, he did tours of Iraq and Afghanistan.

'You name the country, and he was there. I think he got various medals for his bravery in the forces.

'He was a very experienced pilot and has always been a real hero in our family.’

Kensington Palace said it was 'very possible' that Prince William and David Trail may have met before

Authorities fear more bodies may be trapped in the wreck of the pub after the helicopter crash

Mr Traill retired from the RAF several years ago but continued to work as a civilian pilot.

He taught cadets how to fly Chinooks at RAF Odiham in 2007 and 2008 – the same time the Prince was at the base being taught how to fly the twin-rota machines.

Kensington Palace last night said officials were unable to get hold of the Prince to check, but it was ‘very possible’ that their paths had crossed during his military career.

A ninth body was found by emergency services on Sunday but only six have been removed because of the dangerous condition the pub is in.

DCC
 Rose Fitzpatrick said on Sunday: 'The site is extremely challenging and
 the efforts of colleagues from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and
 investigators have been painstaking.

'We
 can now confirm that Samuel McGhee died during the incident on Friday. 
Our thoughts are with his family and friends tonight as they are with 
all those affected by this tragedy.

Aftermath: A helicopter rotor blade is lifted from the roof of the Clutha Vaults pub in Glasgow

The helicopter's rear rotor blade is lifted from the site on Sunday and the wreckage will be analysed

'Sadly I can also confirm the discovery of a further body within the site. This takes to nine the total number of people who died on Friday night.

'Our absolute priority has been to locate the bodies of people who were within the pub at the time of the incident and recover them safely.

'This process takes time, as formal identification procedures have to take place before we can notify relatives and publicly confirm identities.

'We are doing all we can to support the families of those who have lost loved ones. It is essential that we maintain sensitivity and dignity for the families of the deceased.'

The wreckage of the Eurocopter EC135 T2 will be transported to the headquarters of the Air Accident Investigation branch in Farnborough, Hampshire.
