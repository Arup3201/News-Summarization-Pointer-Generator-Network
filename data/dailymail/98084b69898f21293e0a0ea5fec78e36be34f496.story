Ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock tonight apologised to Eric
Pickles after joking that the Tory minister would drop dead if he took part in
the London Marathon.

Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice minister, posted a
letter from Lord Kinnock online in which he suggested getting Mr Pickles to
join him in this year's race 'so we have a helpful by-election'.

The Tories condemned both men for the 'nasty' remarks,
and tonight Lord Kinnock said he has written Mr Pickles 'apologising for the
poor taste which I showed in a light-hearted private note'.

Earlier Mr Khan deleted the tweet featuring the letter
and also apologised.

Tasteless: Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan posted this letter on Twitter from Neil Kinnock, apparently joking about Eric Pickles dying if he took part in the London Marathon

Posting the letter 
online amounted to an 'offensive, personal attack', the Tories said 
which raised doubts about Mr Khan's ambitions to run the capital.

Mr Khan is taking part in this year's London Marathon and is raising money for the Dispossessed Fund.

He has been posting messages of support on Twitter, and last night tweeted a photo of a a hand-written letter from Lord Kinnock.

Scrawled
 on House of Lords notepaper, the ex-Labour leader wrote: 'Dear Sadiq. 
You are mad, crazy, daft, brave... So here's 26.2£ x 4 (1 for each 
adjective) to help you on your way.

'Get Pickles to go with so we have a helpful by-election.... Cheers, Neil.'

Mr
 Khan said the letter was 'witty' and thanked Lord Kinnock and wife 
Glenys for supporting his run, under the hashtag #YesWeKhan.

If Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) took part in the marathon, he would suffer a heart attack and trigger a by-election, Lord Kinnock (right) suggested

The note appears to imply that if Mr 
Pickles were to attempt to complete the 26-mile course around the 
capital he would be killed off, triggering a vote to replace him in the 
Tory safe seat of Brentwood and Ongar.

The Conservatives condemned the joke by Lord Kinnock, and criticised Mr Khan for posting it on Twitter.

Tory
 Priti Patel MP said: 'Sadiq Khan’s judgement is seriously flawed if he 
thinks it is appropriate to tweet Kinnock’s abusive letter.

'To resort to such offensive, personal attacks is a reflection on how desperate the Labour Party are.

'Endorsing
 personal remarks about a cardiac arrest shows they are not fit to 
govern. These desperate, offensive, personal attacks show them up for 
they are; the same old nasty Labour Party.'

A
 Tory source added: ‘It’s nastiness like this which shows why Sadiq Khan
 isn’t fit to be Mayor of London. And if he keeps taking political 
advice from "legend" Neil Kinnock, he never will be.’

Mr Khan is running the London Marathon this year, but also has his eye on running for London Mayor for Labour in 2016

Mr Khan later deleted the letter from Twitter and apologised to Mr Pickles

In an attempt to diffuse the row after it was reported by MailOnline, Mr Khan apologised to Mr Pickles.

He deleted the photo from Twitter, adding: 'Profuse apologies to @EricPickles – I have spoken to him to apologise & am sorry. Inappropriate tweet.'

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said Mr Pickles was content.

'The Secretary of State is relaxed about this. He recognises that occasionally people will write foolish things but he is far too busy getting on with his job to get caught up in this sort of thing,' the spokesman said.
