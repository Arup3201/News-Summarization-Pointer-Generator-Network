Former Major League Baseball superstar Pete Rose, banned from the sport since 1989, has revealed he now earns more than $1million a year signing autographs in Las Vegas.

Throughout his long and illustrious career Rose used to charge for his signature, but since 2005 he has been a regular fixture signing at the Mirage Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, when he now has his own memorabilia shop.

Since 2005, Rose claims to have spent several hours a day, for 15 to 25 days per month, 12 months of the year signing his name for money.

Rose says he is happy to sign and pose for photos with anyone, provided they buy some of the memorabilia he and his business partners sell, including baseballs and photos ranging from $75 to $800.

'I must say that what I do, and I don't mean to sound arrogant about this, but what I do, I think I'm the best at it,' he told The Wall Street Journal.

After years of practice, Rose knows his market in Vegas and says he much prefer conventions and business travelers to party goers.

'Every three days, there's different people. People come here and they have money and they shop and they spend money,' he said.

Pete Rose and fiance Kiana Kim had a short-lived reality show which wasn't a hit with TLC viewers earlier this year

Born in 1941, Rose was nicknamed ‘Charlie Hustle’ during his career as a player from 1963 to 1986. He also managed his hometown team, the Cincinnati Reds, from 1984 to 1989.

He is the all-time Major League leader in hits (4,256), games played (3,562), at-bats (14,053) and outs (10,328).

He won three World Series rings, three batting titles, one Most Valuable Player Award, two Gold Gloves, the Rookie of the Year Award, and also made 17 All-Star appearances at an unequaled five different positions.

Then in August 1989, three years after he retired as an active player, Rose agreed to permanent ineligibility from baseball amidst accusations that he gambled on baseball games while playing for and managing the Reds, including claims that he bet on his own team.

In 2004, after years of public denial, Rose admitted to betting on baseball and on, but not against, the Reds.

He remains hopeful that one day he will be re-instated, but his election to the Hall of Fame remains a contentious one throughout baseball.

While Rose's autograph signing business remains in good health, another of his ventures appears to have bitten the dust.

His reality show TLC's Pete Rose: Hits & Mrs, aired in January but didn't make it to the end of it's six episode run.

The show chronicled the 71-year-old's life with his fiancee, 30-something Playboy model, Kiana Kim and her two children.

Since 2005, Rose has been a regular attraction at The Mirage in Las Vegas where he spends 15 to 25 days per month signing his name for money

'We’re not a traditional family,' said Kim prior to the show launching. 'We are a total modern-day family, mixing the cultures, the ages, the different backgrounds together.'

'I didn’t even know who Pete Rose was when I first met him. It’s kind of a crazy story, but at the core of every family is love and it’s what TLC wants to show.'

Rose had hoped that the show would afford him the opportunity to clear up misconceptions that he believes the public have about him.

'People will get a chance to see what kind of personality I have - and she has,' he said. '... we go through the same things everybody else 
does: taking the braces off, making sure they get their education and 
they go to basketball practice or acting class.'

The couple appeared on Howard Stern's radio show in 2010 to discuss their active love life, while Rose's adult children have voiced their skepticism regarding the engagement.
