Mr Carswell claimed he had been in touch with a Labour MP about the possibility of defecting

The Tories should expect further defections because the party is out of date ‘like HMV’ – according to Ukip’s first elected MP.

Douglas Carswell, who quit the Conservatives to claim a stunning by-election success in Clacton last week, likened his old party to a ‘defunct retail model’ and said it needed to be modern ‘like Spotify’.

As research showed four Tory MPs would do better next May if they jumped ship, one Conservative backbencher said he would ‘never say never’ to the prospect of joining Nigel Farage’s party.

Mr Carswell said it was not just the Tories that were tempted to join Ukip, claiming he had been in touch with an unnamed Labour MP about the possibility of defecting.

Meanwhile, Mr Farage has said that if Ukip held the balance of power in May, it would demand a referendum on the EU by August from both the Tories and Labour.

He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics that he would demand ‘a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union’.

Insiders from Ukip said Mr Carswell’s success in Clacton – and the fact it came so close in the Labour stronghold of Heywood and Middleton – meant that it would be targeting 25 seats in next May’s election. Previously just 12 seats had been targeted.

A poll yesterday showed that Ukip was on 25 per cent of the vote – a level of support which would be enough to take 128 seats in the Commons, according to one analysis.

The Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday put Labour and the Tories both on 31 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 8 per cent.

And it found that 41 per cent believe the Tories should agree a pact with Ukip.

John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said: ‘Today’s poll suggests Ukip’s support has increased much more in the south of England outside London than it has elsewhere in the UK – by a staggering 34 points.

‘If that level was recorded throughout the South, Ukip could win as many as 128 seats, with no less than 102 of them coming from the Conservatives, whose vote in the region is down 14 points.’

The Financial Times reported that four Tory MPs would be more likely to retain their seats if they defected to Ukip. Matthew Goodwin, a professor at Nottingham University, said jumping ship could help Nigel Mills in Amber Valley, Martin Vickers in Cleethorpes and David Nuttall in Bury North.

Chris Kelly in Dudley South would also benefit, but he has said he is stepping down. All four have said they will not join Ukip.

But one senior backbencher told the Mail on Sunday that the situation could change if the Tories lose the Rochester and Strood by-election next month. ‘If they [Ukip] take Rochester and Strood, a number of people will conclude they have a better chance of being re-elected as Ukip,’ he said.

One of Ukip’s targets is likely to be John Baron, Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, who replied ‘You should never say never in politics’ when he was asked on the BBC’s Newsnight whether he would defect. However he added: ‘My very strong preference is to stay within the Conservative Party.’

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Carswell said the Tories needed to modernise. ‘The way the Tory party is retailing politics is like the way HMV retailed music: it’s a defunct retail model,’ he said. ‘I argued that we needed to Spotify politics, we ought to make the Conservative Party a bit more like Spotify, but the Conservative Party can’t change and won’t change.’

Mr Carswell also revealed that one Labour MP is considering switching. But the party’s Michael Dugher dismissed the claim as ‘typical bull****’.
