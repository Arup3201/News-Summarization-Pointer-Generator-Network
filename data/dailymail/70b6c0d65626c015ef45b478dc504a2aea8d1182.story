If you thought Snakes On A Plane was goosebump-inducing, wait until you see 'snake on a car'.

Two men in Queensland, Australia, got the shock of their lives while driving down a three-lane road at about 70km/h (about 43 mph).

Despite their speed, all of a sudden an inquisitive red-bellied black snake - a venomous creature native to the country's east coast, which can grow up to 2 meters long - pops up out of nowhere on their windscreen.

The driver and passenger, not knowing what to do, slow down and start filming the experience.

'Get off my freakin' car!': Driver Ben Lehmann freaks out as a red-bellied black snake entangles itself on his car in Queensland, Australia

Ben Lehmann and his passenger were driving in Capalaba, Queensland when all of a sudden the poisonous snake appeared on the bonnet of the car  

The video, which has received almost 200,000 hits on YouTube, shows the men try a variety of different methods to try and get the snake off their utility.

The incident occurred on Mount Gravatt Rd in Capalaba, a semi-urban area just east of the state's capital city, Brisbane.

Initially the pair use their windscreen wipers to try and flick the dangerous animal off.

However this only entangles it further.

It also seems to enrage the snake. 

Red with anger: In this scary moment of the video, the red-bellied snake, seeming quite enraged, attempts to find a way into the car. Luckily for the two men inside, all the windows were done up

Eeek! The snake makes its move from the windscreen to the passenger window

In the sunlight, the red scales the snake that define the snake become apparent

'I don't know what to do - he's got too much grip,' the driver says at one point.

In the second part of the video, which is much more intense, the now-angry snake can be seen nudging the window of the passenger window, appearing to try and get inside the car.

The driver then decides to speed up the car hoping the snake will fall off in the process.

However it hangs on.

Finally, after about five minutes recording two videos, the snake finally falls from the car.

I can see you: The snake looks straight into the camera while wrapping itself around the side mirror

Psss: The snake continues to try and get inside the car, much to the horror of the men inside

It hits the ground and slithers off the road, hiding underneath a shipment of bricks outside the All Seasons Garden Center.

Not that this would have helped the men at the time, but bites from a red-bellied black snake are rarely life-threatening.

While their venemon is highly toxic, the snakes usually choose to inject very little when biting.

Humans who are bit, however, require immediate medical attention.

Finally!: After about five minutes, the snake finally falls from the vehicle and slithers off into the distance
