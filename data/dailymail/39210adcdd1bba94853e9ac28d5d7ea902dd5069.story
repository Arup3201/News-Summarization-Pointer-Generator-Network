A cellist and a beatboxer may seem like an unlikely musical duo but as this video shows,  it's clearly a combination that works. 

Maximillian, a crew member who usually beatboxes on flights was joined by cellist Francisco Vila and together the pair created sweet music.

The improvised duet took place on a Southwest Airlines flight to Denver and was shot earlier this month. 

Cellist Francisco Vila decided to treat Southwest Airlines passengers to an impromptu 

According to Newsflare, the Indianapolis University Chamber Orchestra was on the flight. 

The air steward did a beat-boxing performance, as he usually does on board the flight, when Mr Vila, the cellist, said he wanted to play a song as well. 

After two tracks the flight attendant joined the impromptu classical act as the other passengers listened in delight. 

The Ecuadorian-Spanish cellist Mr Vila, is said to be one of today's emerging classical music talents and is a soloist in residence at  the prestigious Queen Elisabeth. 

In the video the classical musician directs the air steward to give him  some room to 'bow' before they start on their tune.

Mr Vila then begins his piece whilst the air steward waits for the right moment to join in. 

As the cellist increases his tempo the beatboxer quickens his pace and soon the two of them are racing towards the climax of the tune.

Passengers on the flight can be seen filming the spontaneous show, nodding along as the beatboxer manages to keep to speed.

A round of applause erupts at the end of the recital and appreciative cries of 'that was awesome' fill the air.
