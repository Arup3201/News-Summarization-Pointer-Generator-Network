The BBC’s war with ministers over the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal deepened last night as the broadcaster’s chairman, Lord Patten, warned that it is not an ‘agent of government’.

The peer told Culture Secretary Maria Miller that the BBC should be left to deal with the matter without interference from ministers, although he conceded that the affair was a ‘tsunami of filth’ and ‘the worst crisis the BBC has ever known’.

The row erupted earlier this week when Mrs Miller, whose department is ultimately responsible for the BBC, wrote to Lord Patten expressing concerns about the way it has responded to the Savile revelations.

To the fury of senior Tories, Lord Patten replied by suggesting indignantly that she was questioning the BBC’s independence.

But he stepped up the attack last night saying: ‘In view of what some people have said, it’s quite important for people to remember that the BBC is independent, it is answerable to licence fee payers.

'It’s not an agent of the Government. Occasionally people perhaps misunderstand that.

‘We’re a national broadcaster – we’re owned by the licence fee payers.’

His outburst will deepen the concerns of the BBC’s critics that it is determined to resist external scrutiny.

Lord Patten was also forced to issue a
humiliating apology to Tory party chairman Grant Shapps over the BBC’s 
attempts to gag him.

The Mail revealed yesterday that Mr Shapps was warned against raising damaging allegations about the Savile affair hours before an appearance on BBC political show Question Time on October 11, as the corporation was fighting to contain the revelations.

The email from the BBC’s head of 
public affairs, Julia Ockenden, insisted claims that the corporation’s 
Newsnight programme had scrapped an investigation into Savile’s 
activities because of internal pressure were ‘malicious’.

Mr Shapps was told: ‘No pressure was 
applied to drop this investigation. None. To suggest otherwise is to 
risk impugning the professional reputation and integrity of a number of 
journalists.’

The email referred Mr Shapps to a 
blog written by Newsnight editor Peter Rippon explaining the decision 
not to broadcast claims against Savile. The BBC has since admitted key 
elements of Mr Rippon’s defence were inaccurate.

Lord Patten was yesterday forced to 
concede that the email was ‘misleading’ and too aggressive. He said he 
hadwritten to Mr Shapps saying that ‘if I’d been in his position I would
have felt much the same’.

‘The fact that it was misleading – 
that’s what was wrong,’ he said. ‘I also think the terms in which it was
expressed were unfortunate.’

The BBC is also facing fresh allegations relating to other stars working for it in the 1970s.

A spokesman for the National 
Association for People Abused in Childhood said: ‘We have been told of 
new allegations of abuse at the BBC. This time by three key personnel on
a flagship BBC programme from the 1970s.’

He added the caller rang the helpline but declined to give further details so was advised to contact the police.

It comes as the BBC investigates nine
current cases of alleged sexual harassment, at least two of which are 
of the most serious grade. None of the claims involve paedophilia.

The most serious allegations have been reported to the police, while the others are being handled by the BBC’s HR department.

Letter: Culture Secretary Maria Miller, whose department is ultimately responsible for the BBC, wrote to Lord Patten expressing concerns about the way it has responded to the Savile revelations

Lord Patten admitted he would not be 
surprised if people lost their jobs or faced disciplinary action over 
the scandal once the findings of the inquiries into it were made public.

He told ITV News: ‘I would be delighted if there didn’t have to be, but not surprised if there did.

‘We have to find out who made mistakes, where those mistakes were made and what the consequences of those mistakes were.

'It seems difficult to believe there weren’t any mistakes and those have consequences.’

He admitted that he and the BBC had 
misled the public because of Mr Rippon’s inaccurate claims about why a 
report on Savile’s predatory activities was shelved in 2011, shortly 
after the former Top Of The Pops presenter’s death.

Lord Patten added: ‘The BBC hasn’t 
done as well as we should have done, to put it mildly, and that is an 
issue we will have to address in the aftermath of this.’

Mark Williams-Thomas, the former 
detective who fronted a bombshell ITV documentary on Savile, said the 
‘true figure’ of the DJ’s victims could be 500.

He said: ‘What we do know is that it’s going to be in excess of 300. We are talking about four decades of abuse.

'We will see a criminal investigation in respect of other significant individuals, and not just in the media.

'There are people in significant 
standings in the community who will hopefully be sleeping very 
uncomfortably, and who will in due course be subject to criminal 
investigation.’
