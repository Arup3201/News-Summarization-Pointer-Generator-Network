Kind-hearted Britons have donated an incredible £55million to help more than half a million people affected by the typhoon which devastated parts of the Philippines.

The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) said its aid agencies have now reached almost 600,000 survivors across the country, providing much-needed clean water, food, medical care and materials for temporary shelter.

A spokesman for the DEC said: 'The 
generosity of the UK public has been overwhelming and will make a huge 
difference to people's lives.

Cash raised through the Philippines Typhoon Appeal is helping to fund crucial aid in some of the worst hit parts of the islands.

The scale of the disaster remains enormous with more than 13 million people now known to be affected, the DEC said.

Four
 million people have been forced to leave their homes since Typhoon 
Haiyan struck almost two weeks ago, while the death toll is expected to 
exceed 10,000.

Aid 
agencies are focusing on reaching the most remote areas of the country, 
after facing difficulties with debris on roads and poor access to ports 
and airports.

Access is now improving, however, as debris is being cleared from roads and bridges are repaired, the DEC said.

Speaking
 on behalf of the 14 UK charities which make up the DEC, chief executive
 Saleh Saeed said: "Thanks to the people of the UK, aid agencies have 
been able to help save lives. We can and must do more.

'It
 will take months and years for people to recover and we will 
immediately start helping people with better shelter and the means to 
rebuild their lives.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'The British 
Government is providing vital aid directly to those that need it with 
the help of charities on the ground. Since the Typhoon hit and we 
activated the Rapid Response Facility, DFID has helped charities to 
immediately scale up their response.  'On top of this, we have 
harnessed military assets including cargo planes and logistical 
equipment to ensure aid not only gets to the Philippines but reaches the
 neediest people in the most remote parts of the country.'
