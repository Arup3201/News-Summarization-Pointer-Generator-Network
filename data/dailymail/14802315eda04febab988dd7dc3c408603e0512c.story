Former first lady of Virginia Maureen McDonnell will spend 18 months in jail for public corruption, if prosecutors get their way.

The wife of disgraced former Governor, Bob McDonnell, is due to be sentenced later this month for her part in illegally accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans.

He has already been handed a two-year prison term but remains free during his appeal.

In it together: A jury found Bob and Maureen McDonnell guilty of public corruption after they illegally accepted $165,000 in gifts and loans from vitamin entrepreneur Jonnie Williams

Prosecutors and defense lawyers filed memos arguing their positions ahead of McDonnell's sentencing on February 20. 

Her lawyers have argued she should be sentenced to probation and 4,000 hours of community service, while prosecutors said she was a 'full participant' in the crime.

'Because Mrs McDonnell was a full participant in a bribery scheme that sold the Governor's office in exchange for luxury goods and sweetheart loans, many of which she solicited personally, and because she repeatedly attempted to thwart the investigation through false representations, it would be unjust for her not to serve a period of incarceration for her crimes,' documents said. 

Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years after his conviction for public corruption. Prosecutors want his wife Maureen to be given 18-months while her lawyers call for probation

Last year, a jury found McDonnell and his wife guilty of illegally accepting high-value gifts including a Rolex watch, designer clothing, vacations and loans from wealthy vitamin entrepreneur Jonnie Williams, in exchange for promoting his products.

Williams testified under immunity as the prosecution's star witness in a case that exposed the details of the McDonnells' shaky finances and troubled marriage. 

McDonnell testified in his own defense during the six-week trial, acknowledging that he accepted Williams' handouts but did nothing for him in return other than extend routine political courtesies. He was convicted of 11 counts.

U.S. District Judge James R. Spencer surprised many legal experts last month when he sentenced former Gov. Bob McDonnell to only two years, well below the 10 sought by prosecutors.
