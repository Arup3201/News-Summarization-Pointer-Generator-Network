Brendan Rodgers is hopeful recent signing Lazar Markovic will be available for their first Premier League match of the season against Southampton next week, as the Serbian attacker nears full fitness following a tendon problem.

Markovic, who moved to Anfield from Benfica for £20million this summer, has not featured for the Reds since playing one half of their friendly win against Olympiacos in Chicago on July 27.

Rodgers confirmed Markovic is closing in on a return and said if the 20-year-old does not play some part at Anfield on Sunday, he will certainly be ready for Liverpool's match against Manchester City on August 25.

Brief debut: Lazar Markovic has played just 45 minutes for Liverpool since joining from Benfica this summer

Highly-rated: The 20-year-old earned praise from his manager and team-mates following his first display

'He'll hopefully be around then [against Southampton], but if not then he certainly will for the next game,' the 41-year-old told reporters following Liverpool's 4-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund.

'He had a slight problem with his tendon, but he's up to speed.

'He's working with our sports science team, he's looking very strong and if he just misses out, he certainly should be available for the next game.'

Elsewhere, Rodgers confirmed centre-back Daniel Agger continues to receive treatment on a knee problem picked up during the club's recent tour of the United States.

'Dan is still getting some work done on his knee. He's been unfortunate since America, so he's still getting treatment.'

Confident: Liverpool finished their pre-season with an emphatic 4-0 win against Borussia Dortmund at Anfield

All smiles: Rodgers shakes hands with Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp ahead of the friendly

When asked how he would integrate seven new players into his squad and manage the group over the coming campaign, he said: 'There is no chore in it at all. We bring in the right characters, first and foremost. We assess the mentality of the player, they're told exactly what the situation is before they come in so they're not coming in blind to any situation.

'They know the philosophy of how we work exactly, they know the style in which we operate, they know I will speak and communicate with them and they know the team will change because there will be so many games. It'll be about the squad.' 

Integration: The Liverpool boss is not daunted by having seven new players in his squad ahead of season start
