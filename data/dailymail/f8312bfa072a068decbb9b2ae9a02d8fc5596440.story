The North Korean long-range missiles that jangled nerves across the world when paraded through Pyongyang last month were 'almost certainly' fake, government experts and independent researchers have claimed.

The weapons, which were showcased in a lavish show of military muscle to mark the 60th anniversary of the Korean war armistice, were heavily criticised by researchers who insisted they would be unable to fly let alone unleash a deadly attack on the US.

The experts came to the conclusion, following an investigation by NBC News, after studying a series of high-definition photographs taken during the parade, held on July 27.

All a big hoax: The retro rockets should be mounted to the left of this Hwasong-13 intercontinental ballistic missile

Bogus bombs: The weapons were showcased in a lavish show of military muscle last month

'Undulating skin': One expert pointed to 'undulating skin' on the warheads that would create drag, pulling them off course and out of the sky in a matter of minutes

The revelation casts further doubt on the hermit nation's bellicose showboating after its failed Unha-3 rocket launch in April 2012.

'My opinion is that it's a big hoax,' said Markus Schiller, an aerospace engineer in Munich and former RAND Corp. military analyst.

He said he saw no evidence of 'retro rockets' on the back of the Hwasong-13s, hardware that is necessary to propel them into sub-orbital space and strike faraway targets. 

James Oberg, an NBC News space and 
missile expert who witnessed first hand the 2012 failed launch, agreed, 
pointing to 'undulating skin' in the warheads that proves they are 
bogus.

Grandiose statement: Unidentified North Korean drones are displayed during a military parade past Kim Il-Sung square marking the 60th anniversary of the Korean war armistice in Pyongyang

Fake numbers: An expert added that North Korea also seems to be trying to inflate the number of weapons it claims to possess, claiming it reproduces old pictures of warheads to pass them off as new

'Upper-stage missile skin has got to 
be really smooth, or else it sets off high-speed turbulent air flow that
 can both heat the region and also create localized drag effects that 
can pull the missile far off attitude (direction), or even pull it 
sideways and thus lead to loss of control and disintegration,' he said.

 added that North Korea also seems to be trying to inflate the number of
 Hwasong-13s it claims to possess, saying it reproduces old pictures of 
warheads to pass them off as new

'I
 can tell that on the mock-ups, they simply changed the markings and 
serial numbers from last year's parade to make it look like they have 
more missiles,' he said.

It is not the first time North Korea's missile capabilities have been called into question.

In 2012, experts claimed the North Korean missiles that were 
paraded as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the country's 
founding father, Kim Il Sung, were also probably fakes.

'There is no doubt that these missiles were mock-ups. It
remains unknown if they were designed this way to confuse foreign 
analysts, or if the designers simply did some sloppy work,' revealed a 
researcher in a paper posted on Armscontrolwonk.com.

Those missiles, called KN-08s, were loaded on to the largest mobile launch vehicles North Korea has ever unveiled.

That caused an international stir with the weapons appearing to be new, and designed for long-range attacks.

Along with developing nuclear weapons, North Korea has long been suspected of trying to field an ICBM capable of reaching the United States.

Washington contends that North Korea's failed April 13 rocket launch was an attempt to test missile technology rather than the scientific mission Pyongyang claims.

North Korea has a particularly bad track record with ICBM-style rockets. Its four launches since 1998 - three of which it claimed carried satellites - all ended in failure.

North Korea also frequently overstates its military capabilities. Last year, one of its senior military leaders, Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho, claimed his country was armed with powerful modern weapons capable of defeating the United States 'at a single blow'.
