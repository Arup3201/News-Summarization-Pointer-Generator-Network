A 12-year-old boy captured the heart of a young girl – and her mom – sat behind him at the Red Sox ball game on Friday night when he handed the surprised fan a foul ball he’d just received on the third base line.

The young charmer, Ryan, was sitting in the stands at Fenway Park, Boston, when his random act of kindness was caught on camera.

The young girl, Reece, looked delighted to receive the ball, while her mom seemed even more impressed with the young man’s behavior.

After giving the ball to Reece, the two broadcasters also noticed that she couldn't appear to keep her eyes off Ryan.

‘I think that’s one of the nicest things I've seen at the ballpark all year,’ said one of the broadcasters commentating on the game.

‘Somebody has made a friend,’ commented the other.

A reporter was promptly dispatched to interviewed young Ryan and to give him not one, but two baseballs as payback for his kindness. 

‘I thought it is a nice thing and it is good to make people happy,’ said a bashful Ryan, who also to give a shout out to his own mom who was sitting nearby and looked extremely proud of her son's good behavior.

Ryan’s good will to others didn't stop there. He was also handed a goodie bag and could be seen moments later giving a bracelet that was in the bag to Reece who once again looked very happy to receive it.

Major League Baseball later tweeted about the incident and referred to as a 'power move', reports The Blaze.
