These incredible photographs show one of Hawaii's most active volcanoes spilling out lava into the star-filled sky.

The shots capture the molten liquid spraying from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano and pouring into a tumultuous sea against a backdrop of the night sky. 

They combine the formidable and rarely seen forces of nature, including stormy seas, moonbows and fearsome sunsets all contrasted with one of the Earth's most powerful lava flows. 

Photographer CJ Kale, 38, who constantly braves some of natures most dangerous elements to capture the perfect picture, took the shots. He stood just metres away from the lava 'lake' days after the island's volcano said  

Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano, is 300,000 to 600,000 years old, and is the most active of the five that form the island in the Pacific. 

The lava spraying out onto the surrounding land has been part of one a long-running eruption, which began in 1983.

Galaxy: The stars of the Milk Way shine in the orange glow of the lava flow coming from the top vent of the volcano

Eruption: Photographer CJ Kale, 38, took the photos of the natural phenomenon, standing just feet away from the mouth of the volcano

Glow: Kilauea is the most active of the five volcanoes that form the island in the Pacific 

The lava 'lake' at the summit of the mountain is one of two 'vents' that release lava
