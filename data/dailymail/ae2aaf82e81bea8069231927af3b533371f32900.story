From a mischievous llama to a coy zebra, these animals are striking their best model poses for the camera.

Professional photographer David Boni, from Glasgow, captured the tongue-in-cheek portraits as part of a six-month project.

The 47-year-old set out to create a collection of head shots to make people laugh rather than gush.

What are you looking at? David took the tongue-in-cheek portraits, including this mischievous llama, as part of a six-month project

Strike a pose: David created a collection of portraits intended to make people laugh rather than gush over the adorable animals, including this camouflaged cow

The portfolio includes a mischievous llama and a camouflaged cow, as well as a British bulldog with a stiff upper lip and a feisty looking chicken

David says: 'A lot of animal photography shows the animals looking doe-eyed or pathetic, but with this project I didn't want to show them looking cute.

Say cheese: The British bulldog shows off his stiff upper lip, as he sits down for a rest

Not impressed: It is best not to get on the wrong side of this feisty chicken

'I wanted the portraits to come across as heroic and show off their attitude and characters - if they had fingers these animals would definitely be flicking the Vs.

'It all started by accident when I was shooting a cow for another job, but the shots turned out really well and I absolutely loved it.

'After that, I was on a day trip with my family and there were llamas so I took some shots on a compact camera. They turned out great and the project started from there.

'The llama had so much character, all of the animals were different. I just wanted to make people laugh with the project.

'I didn't have too much trouble working with the animals, I just had to be a bit zen about it. After all they are animals, there is only so much you can get them to do.

'I think the white pony was the hardest shot to get, it was technically quite a difficult image.'
