Mr Johnson claims that incomes from tolls on new roads, passengers on new railways and airport charges would help create returns of up to 8 per cent for pensioners

All the pension schemes in the public sector should be merged into one giant pot to be invested in transport infrastructure, Boris Johnson has said.

The 39,000 funds for public sector workers could be amalgamated to cut out ‘extraordinary’ waste from relying on thousands of pension managers, trustees and advisers, the Mayor of London suggested.

A single fund could be used to create a ‘Citizen’s Wealth Fund’ to boost the economy and improve roads, rail and airport links.

Mr Johnson argued in the Daily Telegraph that incomes from tolls on new roads, passengers on new railways and airport charges would help create returns of up to 8 per cent for pensioners who invested with them.

He calculated local authority pension funds alone could hold assets of more than £180billion, while combining all public sector pensions would yield ‘hundreds of billions’.

Mr Johnson said: ‘There are more than 39,000 public sector pension funds in this country – each with its own trustees, managers and advisers and accountants. The waste is extraordinary.

‘Think of all those advisers and investment managers taking their fees – their little jaws wrapped blissfully around the giant polymammous udder of the state. Think of the duplication.

‘But it is worse than that – because this country is missing a huge opportunity, and one that is being exploited by more sensible governments around the world.’

Mr Johnson highlighted how huge public sector pension funds from Canada, Holland and Singapore are already investing in new housing and infrastructure in London and elsewhere in Britain.

‘We welcome that investment, of course. We are grateful,’ he said. ‘But is it not absurd that we are not able to call upon British pension funds to perform the same function?’ He predicted pension fund managers would try to stand in the way of any change.

Mr Johnson said: ‘The little pension funds will fight for their independence; they will make all sorts of spurious arguments about the need for “localism” in managing this dosh, when of course the advice is all subcontracted to the same legion of investment managers, and when what they really care about is their fees and their tickets to Wimbledon…and their golf-club bragging rights.

‘The vested interests must be ruthlessly overridden. It is time for Britain to have its own Citizens’ Wealth Fund, deploying our assets in a useful way, helping us to bolster pensioners and cut pointless public expenditure at the same time.’

Mr Johnson’s plans go further than proposals already suggested by the Government to move towards Dutch-style collective pensions from 2016.
