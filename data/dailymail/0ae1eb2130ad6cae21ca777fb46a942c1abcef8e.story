Heathrow Airport is set to be surpassed as the world's busiest by a new construction in China due for completion in 2015.

Daxing Airport will be Beijing's third and could have as many as nine runways, under plans that have already antagonised environmental campaigners.

It is expected to handle between 120 and 200 million passengers every year - at least twice the number dealt with at Heathrow.

Busy: Beijing already has two airports, including its Capital International Airport (pictured), but a third is being constructed due to huge demand

The city already has Beijing Capital International Airport and Nanyuan Airport but they are not big enough to handle growing demand.

Air traffic in the country rose in 2010 to 268 million trips - a 16.1 per cent increase on 2009, according to CNN.

Cao Unchun, a profession at China Civil Aviation University, told The Telegraph: 'The existing airport in Beijing has an annual capacity of 75million passengers.

'Last year, it handled 73 million. In two years, it will be totally packed and it cannot be expanded infinitely.'

Minister Li Jiaxing, who is in charge of the Civil Aviation Administration in China, says a single flight cannot be added to the already tight schedule in Beijing.

Details of the construction in Daxing have yet to be announced but according to The Guardian, it will be built 50km out of the city in the village of Nangezhuan.

Labourers are already said to have put up huge signs declaring: 'Construction of a New Airport City for the Capital' near the plot and migrants apparently started work in August.

It is thought it will not only serve Beijing but also Tianjin and Hebei Province.

A new expressway and high-speed rail link is also set for construction to link Daxing and Beijing, according to CNN.

The latest development comes just three years after the unveiling of Beijing Capital International Airport, which was designed by British architect Norman Foster.

Heathrow Airport Terminal Five - Daxing Airport will be bigger and busier

At the time, it was the world's biggest airport building with the same amount of floor space as all the terminals at Heathrow put together.

China's aviation industry is positively booming, making profits of 43billion yuan (Â£3.9billion) last year - three times the figure for 2009.

It intends to increase the number of airports from 175 to 230 in the next five yeas and is expecting to buy more than 20 jet planes over the next two decades.
