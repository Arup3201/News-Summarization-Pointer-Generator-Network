Beer consumption was down for the 181st Oktoberfest festival in Munich with the Bavarian beer celebration's 6.3 million visitors drinking 1.2 million litres less amber nectar than last year. 

This year's visitors downed 6.5 million litres of beer, a significant reduction on the 2013 figures of 7.7 million litres from an estimated 6.4 million guests. 

The 2014 festivities, which began with the tapping of the first keg on September 20, closed on Sunday with the traditional gun salute from the Munich Salute Gun Regiment's one-shot rifles.

Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter declared the 2014 festivities 'unbelievably pleasant' as the final drops were pulled from the last of thousands of wooden kegs.

While there was a reduction in the amount of steins consumed this year, incidences of alcohol poisoning were also down with the Bavarian Red Cross recording just 600 such incidents compared to 629 in 2013 and 739 in 2012.

The Red Cross were seen by 7,900 patients over the two-week event, up marginally on last year, but mainly due to minor injuries after wet weather early on in the festival. 

Police were overall satisfied with how partygoers behaved, with just 720 arrests at the world's largest drinking festival. Actual detentions were down 39 on last year but not all who attended behaved in the right spirit.  

'From bite wounds to kicking, we had it all,' police spokesman Wolfgang Wenger said.Poor weather at the start of the festival resulted in fewer visitors.
