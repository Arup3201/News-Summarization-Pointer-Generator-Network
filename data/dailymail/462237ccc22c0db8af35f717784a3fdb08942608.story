Refusal: Tim Bannister, 35, had offered to carry a tray of drinks at a waterside restaurant to help out a busy waitress

A customer was stunned to be told that he was not allowed to carry a tray of soft drinks in a restaurant because he needed special training.

Tim Bannister, 35, had offered to carry a tray of drinks at a waterside restaurant called Nautical Nellies in Southampton to help out a busy waitress.

But he was told he could not carry them because of 'health and safety'.

Mr Bannister, a technical adviser at chemicals firm AkzoNobel, told The Sun: 'It was embarrassing but also laughable.

The incident happened in November when Mr Bannister was dining with friends at the restaurant.

He offered to carry the four drinks a few yards to the table because it was busy.

But when his offer was turned down, he was so incensed that he contacted  the Health and Safety Executive.

They set up an independent panel – the Myth Busters Challenge Panel - to scrutinize such ludicrous decisions.

HSE chief Judith Hackitt: 'It’s 
important that we are all ready to challenge stupid decisions made in 
the name of health and safety.'

A spokeswoman for the Universal Marina 
near Southampton said Nautical Nellies had since closed down. Its former
 owners could not be contacted.
