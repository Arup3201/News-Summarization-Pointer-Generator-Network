This is the moment a lorry driver crashed through closing barriers just moments before a high-speed train thundered past - and didn't even notice.

Geoffrey Peachey, 54, drove straight over the level-crossing in his 44-tonne lorry - oblivious to two sets of flashing red lights and a warning klaxon.

The HGV driver then continued with his journey blissfully unaware of the wreckage dangerously left lying on the line in his wake.

Peachy admitted failing to stop at the crossing when the case came to court.

Magistrates told him the consequences of his blunder could have been 'catastrophic'.

CCTV caught Peachey's articulated lorry smashing the red and white barrier as he made his way across the tracks leaving debris on the tracks moments before an express train was due.

Paul Brown, prosecuting, told Cambridge Magistrates' Court that Network Rail had been forced to step in to prevent a disaster.

He said: 'As the level crossing barrier starts to fall it caught on the lorry or the back end of the trailer of the lorry.

'It then ended up falling on to the tracks. Mr Peachey was not aware that it had caught the barrier on the way through and so he carried on without stopping.

'Network Rail became aware that it had happened at the crossing and this affected traffic for the rest of the day.'

Geoffrey Peachey, who lives on a farm in Ely, Cambridgeshire, admitted failing to stop at Ely north railway level crossing, on Bridge Road, at 12.37pm, on July 20.

He was banned from driving for three months after admitting the charges.

Charles Snelling, defending, said that Peachey was a 'trusted' driver but had been unable to see the flashing red lights.

He said: 'Because of his position in his cab he couldn't see the lights and the klaxon was straight in front of him and he didn't hear this either.'

Brenda Anderson, presiding magistrate, described the offence as 'serious' during the sentencing on Tuesday.

She said: 'This is a serious offence aggravated by it being at a busy level crossing. The repercussions could have been catastrophic.'

Peachey was disqualified from driving for three months and ordered to pay a £135 fine, £70 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Speaking after the case, Sgt Linda Welch, the investigating officer, said Peachey had put himself and others in danger.

She said: 'Level crossings are designed to keep people safe and do so when used correctly.'
