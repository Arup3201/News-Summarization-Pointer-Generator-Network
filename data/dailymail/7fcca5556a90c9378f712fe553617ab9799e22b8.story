Etiquette expert William Hanson says that women need to be more accepting of chivalry 

In a world where one-night-stands, booty-calls, cheating and the like are more prevalent than ever, it is perhaps easy to see why chivalry is, if not quite dead, then clinging on precariously on life-support.

We are all a bit to blame for allowing this noble art to fade but what has not helped is the total confusion that men still have over what is acceptable and what is not.

The oft-lampooned bra-burning brigade (the ones who socially style themselves Ms. Sara Parker with no irony whatsoever) have spent so many years screeching from their parapets that any man with a sense of decency is at a loss as to what is now correct. 

'If I hold this door open for her, will she launch into a lecture?' 'Should I remain seated when she gets up to use the restaurant loo just to keep the peace?' 

A few loud-mouthed 'wimmin' (as they would have us spell it) have ruined it for the rest of us.

Chivalry can be dated back to the mid-twelfth century and while early codes focused on mares of the equine variety and included tips on how to wear your armour, today chivalry is about how a man treats a woman.

But listen, girls. Men really aren't holding doors open for you because we think you'll break into a sweat if we let you muster the energy to do it yourselves.

Equally, we're not pulling your chairs out because they are so heavy you may chip an over-adorned nail if you try to shift it solo.

We do it because it is the nice thing to do. We men would love a bit of attention to be focused on us in a similar way from time to time (and indeed with modern chivalry doors should get held open by whoever reaches them first… although on a date, chaps, make sure that's you). 

Men and women are different. Vive le difference! 

Most ladies should be secure enough now to not worry that accepting a man's coat   means she will have her right to vote revoked with immediate effect.

It is the opposite of chivalry (and good manners) for a woman/womyn/wimmin to bark at the man for playing the gallant knight.

A first date is usually a pretty terrifying experience anyway, what won't help it go well if any party starts belittling the views or actions of the other. 

Those 'wimmin' who don't appreciate chivalrous acts probably aren't worth dating, he adds

Due to this complete lack of knowing what is now acceptable, men now can be seen on dates awkwardly and clumsily sitting down first - before the lady - knowing that they have just committed a faux pas but have at least avoided an argument.

And it is that last word that is to blame. The age of feelings we now share has brought on the demise of chivalry.

There are still some of these insecure women about. You may even end up courting one this weekend.

So what acts of chivalry should we men contemplate? My advice is do it all! Pull out all the stops on your next date. If she doesn't like it, is she really worth dating?

A true lady would never rebuke their companion publicly or so soon after the unintended transgression. 

Girls – if you really, really don't like it then firstly, get over yourself, and secondly, just have a quiet word with them at a later stage – politely say that you appreciate the sentiment but you can manage.

Most level-headed people will enjoy and respect little acts of courtesy.

If, and this is for the male readers, you find yourself paired with a Ms. then it is probably best to leave it there. 

See the date out – to walk out or act bored will only be stooping to her level – but make sure you are unavailable for future engagements with her. 

She clearly doesn't want the company of men and so should get used to not having it.

RISE UP 

A gentleman should always rise from his seat when a lady arrives or leaves the table (for example, to go to the lavatory). 

That said, in correct etiquette a woman (or man) does not leave the table until the end of the meal. 

But should the lady need to nip to the loo mid-meal then the time to do it in a restaurant or hotel dining room is after the main course, before the pudding. 

And ladies – please leave the table quickly so we men aren't left standing for long. Get up and go!

SEAT WITH A VIEW 

Table for two? Position the lady in the seat where she will have the best view of the restaurant and wont get stuck looking at the wall. 

If you are meeting your date at the restaurant then a nice touch is for the man to arrive beforehand and check the table is satisfactory and you aren't going to be stuck next to the door to the kitchen.

ORDER LAST: PAY FIRST

Properly trained waiters should ask for the lady's order first, before the man's, but if you are eating in a less than excellent eatery then ask your date to give her order before yours. 

The man, on a first date, should always pay… unless it's gone horrifically badly in which case there may be a case for you both 'going Dutch'. For the second date onwards, whoever initiates the date should pay.

GET YOUR COAT

Walking to a bar for a postprandial drink? Is your date shivering? Even though it is probably caused by her insufficient dress, a man should offer his coat to drape over the woman.

(As a side note, men, don't think you'll impress your date by showing how 'hard' you are by leaving the house in just a shirt. Compensating much?)

BE HONEST

Let's face it, not all dates are going to end with a marriage and 2.4 children, or even get close to. If something isn't working then both parties owe it to each other to be honest and grown-up about the situation rather than protracting things with smoke and mirrors.
