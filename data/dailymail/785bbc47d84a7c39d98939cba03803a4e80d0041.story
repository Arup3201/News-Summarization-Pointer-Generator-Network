A solo cyclist was the first victim of the Alpine gun massacre – and not the British al-Hilli family.

The hugely significant development throws the focus of the entire investigation back on to 45-year-old Sylvain Mollier, a Frenchman who was hit by up to seven bullets in the attack in eastern France.

Mr Mollier, who worked in the nuclear industry, died in an isolated wooden lay by near Lake Annecy on September 5.

New developments: Investigators now believe French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was killed before the Al-Hilli family

Until now he was regularly described by detectives as ‘collateral damage’ to what looked like the professional assassination of Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf.

All were all found dead in the family BMW in an attack which left Mr Al-Hilli’s seven year old daughter Zainab severely wounded, and his four-year-old Zeena traumatised. 

But the latest ballistic report into the atrocity reveals that Mr Mollier was the first to be attacked.

Forensic examinations of the soles of victims’ shoes combined with a detailed analysis of bullet trajectories reveal that Mr Al-Hilli was outside the car with Zainab while the gunman was targeting Mr Mollier.

Mr Al-Hilli is said to have been ‘surprised’ by what he saw, and tried to get back into the car, where the rest of the family were waiting. But, in his haste and panic, Mr Al-Hilli reversed the BMW into a muddy bank where the rear axle of the estate car got stuck.

It was then that the killer shot him repeatedly in the head, and also used a semi-automatic gun to murder his mother and mother-in-law, sitting in the back seat of the  car.

The assassin then returned to ‘finish the cyclist off’, said an investigating source who made details of the ballistics report public.

The report also shows that the cyclist’s body was moved at some point.

The long waited report appears to confirm that just one gunman was involved in the attack, and that he turned from ‘one victim to another in quick succession’.

Police now believe that this modus operandi suggests the work of an amateur, rather than a ‘professional assassin’.

A month ago Mr Mollier’s body was ‘temporarily buried’ in a secret ceremony, even though this went against the wishes of his family, who had asked for him to be cremated.

Thirty people attended the funeral, which took place in a closed burial site which was deliberately kept hidden from the media.

French investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘double life’ and been the intended target of the shooting.

Mr Mollier worked for Cezus, a subsidiary of the Areva Group, specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers.

He had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his new partner, a pharmacist, gave birth in June.

Mr Mollier was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside.

Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute
with his brother, Zaid, over their father’ s will, and had changed the 
locks on the family home before they went on holiday to keep his sibling
out. Mr Al-Hilli also kept an illegal Taser defence weapon at home – 
suggesting that he lived in fear of attack.

Both Zainab and Zeena are now back in Britain and being kept at a secret location.

Brett Martin, a 53-year-old Englishman who used to be in the RAF, was 
the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle.

The family left their Europa campsite after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy
