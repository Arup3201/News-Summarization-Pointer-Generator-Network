On D-Day, they defied fierce German shelling and machine gun fire to reach the Normandy beaches.

Seventy years on, and much frailer, our Second World War heroes have come up against a new adversary as they return for the landmark anniversary... French bureaucrats.

The authorities require veterans’ groups to complete lengthy forms at short notice or risk being turned away from the battle sites on June 6.

Ken Smith, 89, was one of the youngest – and luckiest – soldiers to survive the D-Day landings after a radio he was carrying on his back deflected two bullets.

Paperwork: D-Day veteran Ken Smith who braved bullets and barbed wire to storm the Normandy beaches 70 years ago face a new obstacle to this summer's commemoration - French bureaucracy

The former signals operator, who is 
organising an anniversary trip  for 40 people, was given just four 
weeks’ notice of the demands.

‘We didn’t need to fill in a load of paperwork last time I landed in Normandy,’ he said. ‘I didn’t even need my passport.’

A
 two-page form must be completed for every person attending, including 
personal information and contact details, as well as rank, regiment, 
‘role’ performed on D-Day, medals awarded, events they plan to attend 
and details of their travel arrangements.

 veteran Ken Smith, (pictured in his uniform) is now 89 and is one of 
the youngest making the trip. He was struck by machine gun fire as he 
waded ashore

Mr
 Smith, from York, was forced to spend hours on the phone, along with  
his wife Gloria, to gather all the required details from the veterans, 
their carers and friends in their  party in order to fill in the 80 
pages of forms by last weekend’s deadline.

He said the red tape has been far greater on this occasion than for other commemorative events he has attended.

‘The
 French have never done anything on this scale before so it’s been quite
 a shock. Most of the veterans are in wheelchairs or need walking 
frames, so it’s not as if they present any kind of security threat at 
all.

‘There is a lot of disgruntlement and dismay among veterans, particularly since this has been so late in the day.’

He
 said this is not the first time veterans have been upset by the 
attitude of the French authorities during commemorative visits. On one 
occasion, former soldiers had to stand in the rain for hours during 
speeches, and were then refused permission to collect dry clothes from 
their coach.

Police have 
also stopped disabled veterans being dropped off close to their hotels, 
meaning they have had to be carried, Mr Smith said.

This
 year’s event is the last  to be officially marked by  the Normandy 
Veterans’ Association, which is scheduled to disband in November.

Secretary
 George Batts said: ‘Everybody going to Normandy is affected by this. 
The forms have got to be filled in and if they are not filled in they 
don’t go. Full stop.’

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was working closely with the association to ensure everyone is registered.

He
 added: ‘As a major anniversary, significantly more people than normal 
are planning to attend this year’s commemorations, putting significant 
pressure on the transport network, and as a result the French 
authorities will be putting in place stringent access control.’

It
 is also feared some veterans hoping to attend the Normandy events may 
not know about the requirements and have already missed the official 
deadline.

French police are planning to cordon off the relevant beaches and surrounding areas between June 4 and June 8.

All visitors will require an official pass and vehicles must have security stickers.

Those who have missed the deadline will now have to apply directly to the French government if they wish to attend.

Ukip
 leader Nigel Farage condemned the veterans’ treatment, saying: ‘French 
bureaucracy is what the whole European system is based on.

‘If any British veteran was not allowed to go because he had not filled in a form that would be completely outrageous.’

The MOD says any veteran, family member, or carer planning to attend needs to register their details in advance for access to the invasion beaches and surrounding areas, such as Arromanches, Bayeux, Caen, Ouistreham and the American sector.

A spokesman said: 'As a major anniversary, significantly more people than normal are planning to attend this year's commemorations, putting significant pressure on the transport network, and as a result the French authorities will be putting in place stringent access control.

'We are working closely with the Normandy Veterans' Association and the Royal British Legion to ensure that all veterans wishing to attend the commemorations have all the information and support they need to register for the key events.'

The MoD has stopped processing forms for non-veterans - who now have to apply direct to the French authorities and supply photo ID.

Mr Batts has apologised to members that the time limit for the return of the forms could not be extended.

'This was due to procrastination by the French Government and therefore completely beyond our control,' he wrote to branches.
