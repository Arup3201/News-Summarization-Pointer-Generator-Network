Going a week without a shower, blowing your nose on a tea towel, and going commando before laundry day are just some of Britain's dirty little secrets, according to new research.

Four out of five respondents admit to living in a messy home with some using their hairdryer, tea towels and even socks to do the dusting. 

What's more, even though we admit that our houses are a state, 70 per cent are happy eating food off the floor.

Would you..? Even though British houses are a state, 70 per cent would eat food off the floor

Nearly half (45 per cent) admit to having bad washing up habits with one in 10 re-using their lunch plate at dinner time without cleaning it.

Others revealed the great lengths they go to to avoid dishwashing, including using papers plates and even wiping lipstick marks off of glasses instead of giving their guests a clean one.

What's more, 46 per cent of 2,000 
Britons aged 25 and over surveyed only clean their windows when we can 
no longer see out of them or when a bird messes them up.

When it comes to the bed sheets, 60 per 
cent don't change their bed linen every week - with one 
person even owning up to buying brand new sheets to avoid washing their 
dirty ones.

And it seems women fair better than men when it comes to sleeping in 
fresh, crisp sheets with 40 per cent changing them weekly, as opposed to 
an incredible 20 per cent of men only doing it once a month.

According to a staggering 90 per cent of the people surveyed online anonymously, the most common reasons for slovenliness are a lack of motivation, time and enjoyment.

A spokesperson from eco-cleaning brand method, who commissioned the research, commented.

'The road to discovering the country's dirty little secrets has been both fascinating as well as a tad shocking at times, but we are happy to say that it's not all bad news.

'Our research shows that nearly a third of the nation admit to having a spotless home and are self-confessed clean freaks. So for the rest of us there is still hope.

'As a nation, our cleaning habits have changed quite dramatically in recent years. Instead of doing a big clean once a week, we do little bits throughout the week and fit it in when we have time.

'In our busy lives we don't have hours to spend cleaning and instead we clean as we go. Life's too short - we want to spend our time doing more enjoyable things. The mess can wait! method gives you another option.  We like to challenge everyone to make cleaning fun!'
