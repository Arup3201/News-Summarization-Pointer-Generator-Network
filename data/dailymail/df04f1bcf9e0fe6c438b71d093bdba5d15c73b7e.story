A primary school headmaster has come under fire after he took time off during term time to compete in an international triathlon in the Austrian Alps.

Paul Simon Abeledo, 45, is being investigated after he flew out to take part in the ETU Triathlon championship in picturesque town of Kitzbühel on June 20.

For parents, taking their children out of school during term time can mean sanctions, fines and the threat of legal action.

But it is unclear whether similar rules apply for the primary school, who is headmaster of Rush Green Primary School in London.

The father-of-one, who is a keen runner, cyclist and swimmer, is now facing criticism after a whistleblower complained to his school’s chairman of governors and local council chiefs.

Parents who take their child out of 
school in term can be fined £60, which increases to £120 if it is not 
paid within 28 days. Failure to pay can result in court action.

In May, a 10-year-old girl was 
refused time off school to attend her grandfather's funeral because the 
reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'. Demi Hodge, a student at Hansbury Farm Primary School, Tamworth, was told that she couldn't attend the service and her parents were threatened with a £1,000 fine.

And last month a mother from Shrewsbury, Shropshire was told that she would face criminal proceedings if she took her son out of school so that he could attend her weekday wedding.

Council bosses in Barking and Dagenham are trying to establish if the amateur athlete received the go-ahead to leave school during the week to participate in the gruelling event.

A Barking and Dagenham Council spokesman said: 'The chairman of governors, with support from the local authority, has set up an independent investigation to look into the matter.'

Neither Mr Abeledo nor school governors would comment on the row last night.

Records at triathlon.org show Mr Abeledo, who competed in the sprint distance event,  finished in 43rd place in the 45-to-49 male category - completing the 750-metre swim, 19.7km bike ride and 4.8km run in one hour, 19 minutes 26 seconds.

Mr Abeledo, who’s been headmaster at Rush Green Primary School for the last year, has competed in triathlons all over Europe.

The ambitious teacher took part in the Pontevedra ITU Duathlon World Championships in Spain during half term, three weeks before the Kitzbühel event.

He also competed in the Horst ETU Powerman Long Distance and Sprint Duathlon European Championships in Holland during the Easter holidays in April as well as tackling the elite Iron Man triathlon in Switzerland in July 2010.

Mr Abeledo describes himself as 'focused, driven and relentless' on his profile page on top worldwide business network Linked In.

In May, a 10-year-old girl was refused time off school to attend her grandfather's funeral because the reasons for her absence did not amount to 'exceptional circumstances'.

Demi Hodge, of Hansbury Farm Primary School in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was told she could not attend the service in Watford, Hertfordshire - and her parents were threatened with a £1,000 fine.

The day before the funeral, her parents Gaynor, 39, and Leigh Hodge, 41, who had sent the form one week earlier - received a letter from headmaster Peter Hollis refusing the request.

Mr and Mrs Hodge decided to risk the fine and take Demi to the funeral, and it was only once they contacted the school to see if they would be punished that they were told the refusal was a mistake.

The school told Mrs Hodge that the headmaster had not read the letter properly and did not know the request related to a funeral. Mr Hodge has since ‘apologised unreservedly’ for the error.

Facing criminal prosecution: Clare and Andrew McLeary with their son Riley Bryan, nine, moments after getting married in Cornwall

Last month a mother from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was told she would face criminal proceedings if she took her son out of school so that he could attend her weekday wedding.

Clare McLeary flouted a school ruling by taking nine-year-old son Riley Bryant out of lessons so he could watch her tying the knot with fiancé Andy McLeary, 37, on Lusty Gaze beach in Newquay, Cornwall.

Mrs McLeary, 30, who works as a police call handler, wrote to Clive Church of England School asking for permission to let Riley miss three days this week.

But the school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as ‘exceptional circumstances’.

The couple, who have been together for three years, are now facing a criminal prosecution and believe their wedding pictures might be used in court to prove Riley’s unauthorised absence from school.

Mary Lucas, headteacher at the school, said: 'The school will only authorise leave in exceptional circumstances. I would have been happy to talk to the parents about this request if they had come to see me.'

Other recent cases include that of a mother who defied a council’s bid to gag her after she was prosecuted for taking her children on holiday in term time.

Janice Skelcher - who is now fighting for a change in the law - and her husband Ian took their two children to visit family in Australia.

She said the three-week trip had to be during term time as she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged.

They refused to pay a £240 fine imposed by Coventry City Council and were prosecuted.
