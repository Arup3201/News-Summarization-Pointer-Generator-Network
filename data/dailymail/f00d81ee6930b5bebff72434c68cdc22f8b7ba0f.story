Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

Is there any way back? At what point is enough is enough and football begins to turn its back on Luis Suarez?

As news began to sink about this latest, remarkable controversy to engulf Suarez, the calls for him to be banished from the game for an indefinite period were long and loud. Three strikes and you are out, so the theory goes.

‘I do not want to see one of the best players in the world banned from this tournament but you cannot have that example,’ former England manager Glenn Hoddle said on ITV. ‘You do that in a street somewhere and you are going to prison.’

FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings, to which Uruguay and Suarez have until 9pm UK time on Wednesday to provide evidence.

A statement on FIFA's website said: 'FIFA can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player Luis Suarez of Uruguay following an apparent breach of art. 48 and/or art. 57 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil match Italy-Uruguay played on 24 June 2014.

'The player and/or the Uruguayan FA are invited to provide with their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 June 2014, 5pm, Brasilia time.

'According to art. 77 lit. a of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC), the FIFA Disciplinary Committee is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officials' attention.

'Furthermore, according to art. 96 of the FDC, any type of proof may be produced (par. 1), in particular are admissible, reports from referees, declarations from the parties and witnesses, material evidence, audio or video recordings (par. 3).'

There is no defending Suarez. Biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in November 2010 could have been considered an aberration but to repeating the transgression on Branislav Ivanovic of Chelsea (April 2013) and now Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini highlights an underlying behavioural problem.

Suarez, for some reason, doesn’t learn but what he may now discover in the wake of this absurd moment in Natal is that the trust managers and team-mates have for him begins to slowly dwindle away. How can you rely on someone that has the ability to let you down?

From now on, that question will lurk in the back of everyone’s mind. He might be a genius, one of the most spell-binding players in the world when at the peak of his powers, but that habit of going wildly off the rails is going to be his legacy.

What happens with him now will make for intriguing viewing. A move to Barcelona has been mooted and the signs that have been coming from Spain in the last few days was that a bid to prise him away from Anfield was looming.

But will 
this controversy force Barcelona to abort? They pride themselves on the 
motto ‘mes que une club’ (more than a club) but will they go him for him
 now? Given the turmoil they have experienced in the past year over the 
deal to sign Neymar, do they need to bring more trouble to their door?

There will, inevitably, be ramifications for Liverpool too. Should he stay on Merseyside, he will be the subject of intense scrutiny, critics will be waiting for him to step out of line and ask how they can continue to offer support when he has besmirched their reputation.

Yet ask Brendan Rodgers or any of his team-mates and they will all tell you the same thing about him around the training ground: he is quite and humble, never any trouble. He comes in, relishes his work then goes home to dote on his family. They don’t see the monster that others do.

They see a world class player and that is why, regardless of the shock and horror of this bite on Chiellini, he won’t fail to have a career at the highest level.

‘I’m staggered but it won’t affect him,’ said former England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day. ‘There will always be someone who is prepared to take a gamble on him.’

Yet there will always be that anxiety with Luis Suarez that a moment of madness is never far away.
