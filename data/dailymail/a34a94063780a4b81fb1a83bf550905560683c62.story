Britain's biggest union is plotting to cripple the country with the first general strike for nearly 90 years.

In a move that it privately admits is ‘explicitly political’, Unite will meet other unions later this month to discuss a co-ordinated nationwide industrial walkout.

Leaked papers from the union, which has 1.5million members, describe a general strike as a ‘desirable’ protest at the Government’s austerity drive, including the recent changes to benefits.

Last night fellow union, Unison, 
which has 1.3million members, said it would back proposals for a general
strike as long as it was the end, not the beginning, of a protest 
campaign.

The leaking of Unite’s explosive plans comes as its members are voting to elect a new leader.

Current general secretary Len 
McCluskey – nicknamed ‘Red Len’ – is opposed in the ballot by one other 
candidate, Jerry Hicks, who is backed by the Socialist Workers’ Party.

A result is expected on April 15, and a meeting about a general strike is due at the Trades Union Congress HQ nine days later.

The Conservatives are calling on 
Labour leader Ed Miliband, whose biggest backer is Unite, to stop taking
cash from the union until it withdraws the strike threat.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps 
said: ‘Labour’s single biggest union paymaster is threatening British 
businesses and hardworking people with mass strikes.

‘Ed Miliband must refuse to take a 
single penny more of his union paymaster’s cash until Len McCluskey 
withdraws Unite’s threat to sabotage our economy.’

Since Mr McCluskey became leader in 
September 2010, Unite  has donated £8.4million to the Labour Party, 
according to the Electoral Commission.

The threat of co-ordinated industrial
action comes after unions voted overwhelmingly last September to start 
planning the ‘practicalities’ of the first general strike  since 1926.

Britain's previous general strike came in May 1926 following a dispute over reduced wages for coal miners.

After the miners (right) were locked out from work, the TUC called on its 1.7million members to walk out of their jobs in solidarity.

Last-minute
negotiations with prime minister Stanley Baldwin's government were called off after 
the Daily Mail's printers refused to print an editorial criticising the 
proposed strike as a 'revolutionary move'.

The workers participating in the general strike included railway workers, dockers and steelworkers. Thousands
of volunteers and special constables tried to replace the lost labour, 
and after nine days the TUC admitted defeat and called off the action.

Then from 1978 to 1979, the Winter of Discontent saw a public sector strike under Lord Callaghan's Government, which resulted in power cuts and piles of rubbish on streets.

The strikes, which called for bigger pay rises, had even seen gravediggers join picket lines and leave dead bodies waiting to be buried.

If it goes ahead, a general strike 
would wipe out vital services, with workers from teachers to prison 
guards, firemen to nurses, dinner ladies to paramedics likely to walk 
out.

But such a move is strongly opposed 
by more moderate unions, who fear it would be impossible to organise and
would fuel resentment among the public due to the chaos it would cause.

Yesterday Mike Clancy, general  
secretary of Prospect, which represents professionals such as engineers 
and scientists, said: ‘Whilst an understandable reaction to austerity 
and failing Coalition  policies, talk of a general strike is a dangerous
distraction, allowing the Government to shift attention from its own 
problems.’

At last year’s TUC, Jim McAuslan, 
general secretary of Balpa, the airline pilots’ union, warned: ‘It won’t
work. Worse, it will give our opponents a stick to beat us with.’

A Unison spokesman said yesterday: ‘A
general strike? In principle, yes, we would support that provided there
was a legitimate trade dispute and it was legal.

‘We believe that a general strike can only be the culmination of a campaign, not the beginning of a campaign.’

The Public and Commercial  Services 
union, whose members are taking strike action today, is also keen to 
co-ordinate industrial action for maximum effect.

‘If we as a union movement are 
serious about opposing what the  Government is doing, then clearly the 
best weapon at our disposal is industrial action,’ a spokesman said. 
‘The best way to deploy that weapon is co-ordinated action.'
