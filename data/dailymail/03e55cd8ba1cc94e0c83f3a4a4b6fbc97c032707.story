Money-saving: Lee Beaumont demanded his mains water was stopped after realising he could save cash by using bottled mineral water

A money saving expert has had his mains water supply shut off after realising it was cheaper if he used mineral water instead.

Lee Beaumont does everything in his Leeds home with bottled water - washing, cleaning and even flushing the toilet for less than the cost of his previous monthly bill.

The 25-year-old's brave decision came after Yorkshire Water asked him for a £14 per month standing charge, and so instead of paying up he asked them to cut off his supply.

He now is now saving cash by buying water in bulk from the supermarket, which he says  more than enough for him and his two-year-old dog Bella.

Lee cleans himself using baby wipes and bottled water each day and pops to friends' houses or the gym to use a shower.

To avoid any washing up he drinks and eats using disposable cups, plates and cutlery.

The cash he is saving will help him pay for the redecoration of his home, he says.

'It's been fantastic for me. It has saved me money,' he told MailOnline.

'In April I used one unit of water, and they charged me £16 including a £14 standing charge so I asked them to cut me off.

'When I need the loo I just take the dog bowl and use that to flush the loo and put more bottled water into the dog bowl for her to drink. This means the dog gets fresh bottled water all day.

'In the morning I wake up and use baby wipes I bought in bulk to clean myself and in the evening I have a strip-down wash.

'I also take out free trials with gyms so I can use their showers or go to a friend's house'.

Man's best friend: Lee with his two-year-old dog Bella, who also enjoys mineral water rather than from the tap. He is spending his savings on redecorating his home

Maverick: The 25-year-old uses bottled water to flush the loo and handwashes clothes and is still saving money

He added that he visits the dentist monthly and says he has been told that his teeth have improved since he started using mineral water full-time in May. 

WATER: Was around £18 a month with £14 standing charge. Currently spends at most £14 on bottled water

GAS: Used to spend £35 to £40 per month - now £0 since his boiler broke

ELECTRICITY: Up to £40 a month, now down to £15 a month. His best week was last week - £3.66.

Mr Beaumont, who works from home and runs a self-harm support charity, also decided to cut off his gas supply after his boiler broke and he didn't have the £1,000 to replace it.

'It was hard last winter but I've bought myself a new duvet and have an electric blanket if I need it. I also try to live in one room.

'My electricity bill is now £4 per week and I want to get it lower'.

Lee's entrepreneurial skills have already hit the headlines after he turned the tables on the cold-callers by  setting up his own premium rate phone number – and has since pocketed £300 as a result. 

Cheers! Lee says by buying water by the case he has more than enough to drink, make cups of tea and coffee and make food

Clever: The 25-year-old says his new cheaper life is 'fantastic' and he eats items that only require a kettle

Good health: The entrepreneur says that his dentist has told him that his teeth have got better since he starting using only mineral water

Technique: Lee cleans himself with baby wipes, bottles water or grabs a shower at a friend's house or at the gym

Remarkable: The young man has even set-up his own 0871 number to make money from cold-callers

Washing: Cleans with bottled water, baby wipes and showers at friends or at the gym

Eating and drinking: Items like tea, coffee porridge, pasta or noodles made in plastic pots or cups using boiling water

Going to the loo: He uses water from the dog bowl to flush the toilet

Heating: Has bought warmer duvet, has an electric blanket

Washing up: Lee uses disposable items that can be thrown away when used or broken

The 25-year-old paid £10 plus VAT to 
set up a personal 0871 landline and now makes money every time he 
receives an unsolicited phone call.

He said it was ‘extremely easy’ to set up the number online.

He chose an 0871 number because it was more profitable than one starting with 0845 or 0844.

Mr Beaumont said he gave out the premium rate number whenever he needed to talk to utility companies but had a separate line for his friends and family to call.

‘I was getting annoyed at the PPI calls I was constantly getting so I thought there must be a way to make money out of them,’ he said.

‘I decided I would get an 08 number and realised if I had an 0871 number they would be charged 10p a minute.

MailOnline has asked Yorkshire Water to comment on his case.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
