Manchester United hope to push through the signing of Thomas Vermaelen after the World Cup.

Sportsmail understands that wage package has been agreed in principle between Vermaelen and United and the player is believed to be confident that a move will go through this summer.

Sources close to the Belgian camp in Brazil indicate that the 28-year-old has been instructed by his advisors not to talk about the move publicly but there is an expectation that Vermaelen will be a Manchester United player when the Premier League season kicks off in August.

Moving on: Vermaelen is keen to leave Arsenal and will earn around £100,000 a week at United

Vemaelen is in line for a significant pay rise at Old Trafford and he is expected to sign a deal that will edge him towards the £100,000-a-week bracket at United.

His contract at Arsenal will expire in twelve months’ time and he has little to desire to remain at the Emirates Stadium while he remains behind Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny in the pecking order.

United are understood to have been knocked back in an initial enquiry but it is expected that the clubs will agree a compromise fee in the region of £11million to take Vermaelen to Old Trafford once the Belgian’s involvement in the World Cup is over.

United view Vermaelen as a pragmatic fit with Premier League experience to fill the vacuum that has been left following the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic at the end of last season.
