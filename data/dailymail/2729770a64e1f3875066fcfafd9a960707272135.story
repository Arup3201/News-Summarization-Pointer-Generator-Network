Cem Duzgan, 21, was shot 11 times as he played a game of pool with his friends at the Clapton FC Club in Hackney, east London on October 5 2009

Four men who shot an innocent victim 11 times with a sub-machine gun in a botched revenge killing have been jailed for a total of 114 years.

Cem Duzgan, 21, was shot in the head, body, arms and legs as he played a game of pool with his friends at Clapton Football Club in Hackney, east London, on October 5 2009.

The victim, who lived with his family in Islington and worked as a sales assistant at a clothes store in Croydon, died at the scene, Scotland Yard said.

The court heard the murder was part of a spate of violent tit-for-tat incidents - including other killings - that took place around that time between the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks gangs.

Just three days before Mr Duzgan's murder, another man was shot and killed in a targeted attack while driving a car in Tottenham.

The prosecution case was that Mr Duzgan was killed in revenge, though he was not thought to be the intended target.

Blaize Lunkula, 28, of no fixed address, who was found guilty of murder on February 27 at the Old Bailey, was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 35 years.

Another three men found guilty the same day were also sentenced.

Yusuf Arslan, 24, of no fixed address, was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 33 years.

Ndombasi Makusu, 27, of no fixed address, was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 28 years.

And Christian Barabutu, 22, also of no fixed address, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years.

The court heard that the gunman - Lunkula - gained access to the Turkish social club with the help of an accomplice who held open a pair of secure air lock doors.

People inside became aware something was happening and Mr Duzgan went to investigate the lobby area.

Lunkula opened fire, shooting 11 bullets
 through the victim's head, body, arms and legs. Ballistics experts 
later estimated the weapon was less than 30cm from Mr Duzgan's head when
 it was fired.

Lunkula had travelled to the scene with Makusu and Barabutu, who had been involved in planning and organising the shooting.

Mobile phone analysis found that all the defendants had dumped their phones shortly after the murder and did not use them again. Before the killing they had been in contact with each other frequently.

The phone evidence also pinpointed Lunkula, Makusu and Barabutu as being in the area of the club at the time of the shooting.

The other defendant Arslan remained away from the scene, having been the earlier 'organiser' and present at a 'council of war' when the revenge attack was planned.

Acting Detective Sergeant Simon Franklin, the case officer for the homicide and major crime command, said: ‘The victim was simply enjoying a night out with friends when he went to investigate a disturbance.

‘Sadly this decision cost him his life as he became unwittingly caught up in a bitter and violent rivalry between two gangs operating in the area.’

The Mac 11 machine gun used was not recovered but ballistics experts were able to prove it had been used in two other shootings linked to Hackney Turks premises in 2009.
