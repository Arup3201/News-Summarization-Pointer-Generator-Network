The son of Gerry Anderson, the brains behind the original Thunderbirds, has criticised the computer-generated remake for lacking the 'magic' of the classic show. 

Jamie Anderson said the CGI characters did not have the same charm as the 'lovingly detailed' miniature puppets. 

Thunderbirds will return to our screens tonight 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world.

However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. 

Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope 

Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images 

Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as "quaint", "naff" and "full of wobbly sets". 

'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 

'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' 

He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects – real explosions rather than computer-generated ones.

'There is something utterly magical about seeing a puppet come to life under the skilled operation of talented puppeteers.

'Sadly for fans old and new alike, that's not going to be possible with the new series.'

Quest: As with the original show, the remake will feature the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world

Thunderbirds aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. 

There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. 

The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. 

As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. 

The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065.

When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. 

There is also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island.

The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget

The updated version of the iconic show is not the first attempt at a remake. 

Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was a dismal flop, losing almost £20 million at the box office.

Even Gerry Anderson, the show's co-creator, called it 'the biggest load of c**p' he had seen.   

The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a modest budget, but the new production team spans the globe.

Peter Jackson's animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics.

Rosamund Pike, the Gone Girl star, will voice Lady Penelope in the new show and 89-year-old David Graham has returned to voice her driver, Parker. 

He has dropped his chauffeur uniform and now sports a roll-neck sweater. He also has a clipped Indian accent. 

The new version kicks off on today at 5pm on ITV with a double episode, before moving to an 8am slot on the same day.
