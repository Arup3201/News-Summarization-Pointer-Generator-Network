Lady Tatiana Howard, who was fined £500 after admitting driving her black Porsche without due care or attention, when she struck a pedestrian 

An aristocrat has been fined after running over a pedestrian while driving her Porsche to her King's Road furniture boutique on the wrong side of the road. 

Lady Tatiana Howard was fined £500 after striking David Laing on North End Road, West Kensington when she attempted to overtake a row of stationary cars on the way to her store Tatiana Tafur in Fulham. 

After being hit Mr Laing sustained injuries to his leg, neck and head and required hospital treatment. 

At Lavender Hill Magistrates Court, Lady Tatiana, 49, who lives in a £1million house in Burford, Oxfordshire, admitted driving her black Porsche Boxter without due care and attention. 

Bench chairwoman Cathy Jago told the mother-of-two: 'We have heard that you drove in a dangerous manner. 

'You were driving on the wrong side of the road and that resulted in a pedestrian being hit by your vehicle and him being taken to hospital by ambulance.'  

Prosecutor Melanie Hardwick told the court that it was 10am when Mr Laing was crossing the road outside North End Medical Centre.

She said: 'He says that as he approached the middle of the road he looked to his left and to his right and as he stepped out he was hit by the Porsche.

'The driver said she was rushing to get to work.

'Mr Laing received injuries to his shoulder, leg, neck and head as a result of being struck by the defendant.

'She got out of her car to ask if he was okay and an ambulance was called.'

The court heard Lady Tatiana, who studied History of Art at Sotheby's, already has six penalty points on her driver's licence for using a mobile phone and speeding.

Her lawyer Mr Mark Haslam told the court: 'The impact speed was in the region of 10mph and the injuries were not described as serious.

'The traffic was solid in two lanes and she wished to turn right into Star Road and pulled out of her lane, having checked there was no traffic coming towards her.

Lady Tatiana was driving to her boutique furniture shop, Tatiana Tafur on the fashionable King's Road, pictured, when she struck the pedestrian in nearby North End Road in West Kensington 

'The pedestrian came from between vehicles, from behind a stationary white van and did not choose to use a pedestrian crossing.

'By being on the wrong side of the road she accepts that it was driving without due care and attention.

'All insurance issues have been settled and there was no significant personal injury claim,' added Mr Haslam.

Asking the court not to impose six or more penalty points, which would result in an automatic ban, he said: 'She is a married lady and her husband works in London, where he lives during the week.

'She has twin children, aged seven, and they go to school 18 miles away and there is no public transport.

'She works for her manufacturing company that designs furniture and employs four people, but it is not in the best financial health and the last account showed losses of £8,000.

'She works from home, but also drives to her work three times a week.'

She was also ordered to pay £85 costs, a £50 victim surcharge and received five penalty points.
