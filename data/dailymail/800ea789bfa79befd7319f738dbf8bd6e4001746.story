When a young child becomes bored of the latest Barbie doll or Action Man, it's often thrown at the back of a cupboard to gather dust and be forgotten.

But one artist has found a more creative use for hundreds of unwanted toys discarded each year. Â 

These bizarre sculptures are the creation of Australian-based artist Freya Jobbins who combines a variety of influences to create her unique artwork made from a variety of toy parts.

As well as creating random human faces, Freya's sculptures also include on of Star Wars villain Darth Vader and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character.

And aside from being unique, the Sydney artist's work carries a message about the commercial and disposable nature of the world in which today's children are growing up in.

She said on her website: 'My work explores the relationship between consumerist fetishism and the emerging recycling culture within the visual arts.

'Due to our society's over consumption of plastic children's toys, the materials I need for my assemblages are all very accessible.'

The Johannesberg-born artist takes her inspiration from an ecletic range of sources including the Toy Story trilogy, controversial anatomist Gunther Von Hagen, Guiseppe Archimboldo and his fruit and vegetable paintings, and various other artists.

Her creations are also inspired by a keen interest in Greek mythology.

Freya takes miscellaneous parts of discarded dolls and toys to create the bizarre faces, heads and busts.

Each piece of plastic is painstakingly carved and glued layer over layer to add depth to each sculpture.

As well as her plastic sculptures, Freya, who moved to Australia at the age of nine and grew up in Sydney, also makes prints.

She said: 'The plastic toy assemblages, disturbing to some, I see as my humorous side and my printmaking is what I consider more my voice.'
