American life: Michael Moore says he no longer has anything to say about mass shootings following Santa Barbara slayings

The filmmaker behind Bowling for Columbine has responded to calls for comment following the latest U.S. mass shooting.

Michael Moore wrote a Facebook post describing America's national symbol as the gun, not the bald eagle.

'With due respect to those who are asking me to comment on last night’s tragic mass shooting ... I no longer have anything to say about what is now part of normal American life,' Moore wrote.

'Everything I have to say about this, I 
said it 12 years ago,' he said, referencing his 2002 documentary in 
which he explored the possible causes of the horrific Columbine High 
School massacre in 1999 carried out by teens Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold.

He goes on to say
 that the U.S. is singularly plagued by these violent attacks in part 
because of a climate of fear and paranoia and weak gun laws that enable 
'disturbed white males' to get their hands on deadly weapons - legally.Elliot
 Rodger was found to have three .9mm semi-automatic gun and more than 
400 rounds of ammunition, all of which was legally purchased and 
registered.

Moore writes 
that while other countries have more violent histories than the U.S., 
more guns per capita and consume the same violent movies and video games
 as the U.S., but none have anywhere near the rates of mass killings 
that America does.

'...and yet we don't seem to want to ask ourselves this simple question: "Why us? What is it about US?"' he writes.

Richard Martinez the father of Christopher Martinez who was gunned down by Elliot Rodger echoed Moore's despair.

'When will this insanity stop?' he asked through tears while speaking to the media.

'Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA,” Martinez said, raising his voice.

'They talk about gun rights. What about Chris’s right to live?'

Bowling for Columbine: Moore says nothing has changed since he made the documentary 12 years ago

The bloodshed is just the latest in what is fast becoming a regular occurrence in the United States, and one that is sure to happen again, says Moore.

'We won't pass the necessary laws, but more importantly we won't consider why this happens here all the time,' he writes.

'When the NRA says, "Guns don't kill people - people kill people," they've got it half-right. Except I would amend it to this: "Guns don't kill people - Americans kill people." Enjoy the rest of your day, and rest assured this will all happen again very soon.'
