There are few things more frustrating to the ardent fashionista than spotting a stylish passerby as she drives by - but being unable to ask her where she got her killer outfit.

But now, one clothing company is offering a solution in the form of the first ever shopping car.

The fashion car of the future allows for a little retail therapy while on the move by scanning a must-have item from a distance then offering a selection of lookalikes available on an online store.

The user then chooses the one they want to purchase - and the company will track the whereabouts of the car before delivering the item to the car, wherever it is parked.

Now THAT'S handy: The new concept car by German e-tailer Zalando helps you can what a passer by is wearing, order it and have it delivered to your car- there's even a wardrobe in the boot so you can update your look instantly

The fashion concept car, designed by German e-tailer Zalando, uses a specially designed iPad app to recognise outfits on the streets and enables the user to find a direct match on the Zalando website.

The chosen look will then be delivered direct to the car, which also has an integrated packing station that allows clothes and accessories to be stored in the boot area.

There is even a built-in changing room that pops out of the boot hatch so that you can slip into your new outfit in privacy.

Step one: Fashionistas on the go will be driving along and spot something they like on a passer by

The concept car, launched at the 
International Motor Show in Geneva, is also fully equipped with a compact fashion wardrobe so that you can spruce up 
in style.

Christian Meermann, Chief Marketing Officer at Zalando, said:
'Our fashion car could be the answer to the perfect shopping experience. We believe the car fulfills the needs of the customer of tomorrow.

'In todayâ€™s hectic society, time 
plays a huge part in consumers' buying decision so this concept car not 
only recognises that but also brings an element of fun and playfulness 
to digital shopping.'

Currently only one prototype exists but if there is enough interest, the car could be put into production. The prototype will be on display for one more week at the show.

Step two: The car will then use a special detection device to identify the outfit worn by the passer by and allow you to order it from Zalando straight to your vehicle

Step three: You clothes will be delivered for you to collect from your portable wardrobe in the boot

Ta-da: Your own private clothing rail extends from the boot hatch so you can get changed into your new outfit in privacy
