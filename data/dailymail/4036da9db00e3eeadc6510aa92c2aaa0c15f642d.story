Festive frenzy: Shoppers are expected to spend £12billion next weekend as last-minute bargain hunters hit the high street

Shoppers are expected to spend £12billion next weekend as last-minute bargain hunters hit the high street in the final few days before Christmas.

Retail experts are predicting that shoppers will take to the streets in their thousands, spending almost as much in the four days from December 20 as they did in the whole of October.

Analysts say that many people have been putting off their festive shopping in the hope of bagging a bargain, with many stores slashing prices in the run-up to Christmas.

Some high street giants, including Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, John Lewis and Selfridges have been offering as much as 50 per cent off items in store as Christmas draws ever closer.

Other shoppers have been leaving it late knowing that with many workers leaving their offices for Christmas on Friday they will have three days to do all their buying before Christmas Eve.

Retail consultancy Verdict said that spending over the entire weekend could be as much as 20 per cent higher than it was last year, when Christmas Eve fell on the Monday.

'To put £12billion in context, shoppers spent £17billion in October: it's a huge amount,' Verdict's senior retail analyst Andrew Stevens told The Sunday Telegraph.

'People have been putting things off to see if they can get a bigger deal, but also you have the fact that the 23rd falls on a Monday. People know they can wait to the end of this week and still have three days to shop.'

Many shoppers took to the shops this weekend, with retailers reporting brisk trading yesterday.

More than 330,000 people were expected 
to visit the Bull Ring centre in Birmingham over the course of the 
weekend, while last weekend the Liverpool One complex recorded its 
busiest day since its opening in 2008.

Shop 'til you drop: London's Oxford Street was on course to host 6.2 per cent more shoppers this weekend compared to last year

Cutting prices: Many stores are offering discounts of up to 50per cent as they try to lure shoppers

Sales were up nine per cent on the corresponding Saturday last year, with takings in Union Square, Aberdeen, rising by the same figure.

In the last week five per cent more people have visited the Silverburn centre in Glasgow compared with last year.

One of the country's most famous shopping destinations, London's Oxford Street was on course to host 6.2 per cent more people this weekend compared to last year, while the Westfield Centre in Shepherd's Bush will stay open from 8am until midnight on the 23rd in order to cater for last-minute shoppers.

The Bluewater shopping centre in Kent will also be opening until midnight on the 23rd, with 20 of the stores including Rigby & Peller and All Saints staying open.

Robert Goodman, Bluewater's general manager, said: 'This weekend is likely to see a similar surge in sales and footfall to Black Friday, but driven largely by need rather than retailer promotions. 

'For some, the weekend is the last chance to shop in earnest for Christmas presents, and our stores are going to be busy. 

'Over the four days we will also have a lot of guests that are here to treat themselves, having completed their Christmas shopping already. 

'We also expect guests to take advantage of our extended opening hours, including the debut of midnight trading on Monday, to make a day of their visit to Bluewater.'

Christmas countdown: Bargain hunters, such as these shoppers in Cambridge, are expected to flock to the shops in their thousands next weekend

Tom Nathan, general manager at Brent Cross shopping centre in north London, said people were leaving it later than ever to do their Christmas shopping.

'Christmas really started from Black Friday which has become a far bigger phenomenon than previous years,' he said.

'People are leaving it later and later because retailers have better ranges available.

'The general view customers take is that if I want to buy something, I can have it.'

Shops and restaurants at the Trafford Centre, just outside Manchester have also been reporting increased sales.

General manager Richard Paxton said: 'Some of our retailers are offering pre-Christmas deals, in a bid to attract customers to their stores. Savvy shoppers are arriving early on Saturday mornings, or staying later into the evening, for uninterrupted Christmas shopping with the chance of some great bargains.'

Among the stores offering discounts to entice savvy shoppers are Tesco, which is cutting prices on electronics, John Lewis, which is offering up to 50 per cent off selected womenswear brands including Hobbs and French Connection as well as deals on electrical items, and House of Fraser which has 40per cent off selected premium brands in a deal that ends at midnight.

Gap has 50per cent off many items in store, Topshop is offering 30per cent off coats, Halfords have deals on bicycles and SatNavs and Mothercare has also cut prices by 20per cent.

For hosts needing extra furniture to help them house guests over the Christmas period Homebase is offering a 20per cent online discount, and B&Q has half price Christmas lights for those who are yet to deck their halls and trim their trees.

Mike Coogan, Toys R Us marketing and ecommerce director said: 'The additional days before Christmas will be outstanding for shoppers and big for retailers, Toys R Us are working hard to ensure we'll have plenty of the popular and best selling toys still in stock right through until Christmas Eve at the best possible prices.'

Bargain hunters: Christmas shoppers on Oxford Street

Predictions: Retail consultancy Verdict said that spending over the entire weekend could be as much as 20 per cent higher than it was last year, when Christmas Eve fell on the Monday

Roughly £3.3billion of the £12billion total will be spent online, with £2.4billion on that on non-food items.

Around half of the £12billion will be spent on food, £900million of which will come from online sales, with customers opting to have their groceries delivered, rather than brave the busy supermarkets.

Waitrose is expecting the number of internet deliveries to rise by 60per cent in the final week before December 25, and expects 10am to 11am on December 23 to be its busiest hour of trading.

A spokesman from Asda said that the supermarket is expecting the weekend before Christmas to be one of its busiest, with shoppers enjoying offers including £10 bottles of Pierre Darcys Champagne - with sales currently up 35per cent on last year.

Alongside food the chain has noted an increase in shoppers buying festive jumpers and onesies, with £3million worth of Christmas knitwear sold in just one week, and 2million onesies sold since October at the rate of £1million worth every week.
