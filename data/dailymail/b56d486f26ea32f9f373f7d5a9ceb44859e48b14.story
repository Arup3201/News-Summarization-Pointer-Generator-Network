Since age seven, fifth-grader Shyanne Roberts has had one passion - firing guns.

Now aged 10 she has become a sensation in competitive shooting tournaments across the United States, using a weapon painted in her favorite colors, purple and black.

And despite the perceived dangers, the Franklinville, New Jersey, girl believes: 'Kids and guns don't always mean bad things happen.'

Young gun: Shyanne Roberts from Franklinville, New Jersey, began competing in local shooting matches aged seven. Now 10, she is taking tournaments across the country by storm

According to CNN, when Shyanne was five, she started to learn gun safety laws. By age six she could recite them off by heart, so her father Dan started taking her to a gun range.

It was not until she was seven that she developed the passion and began competing in local matches.

She told CNN: 'I want to be an inspiration to other kids and be a leader. It's not a hobby; it's what I want to do!'

Her father, who has custody of Shyanne and her younger brother says he is 'very comfortable' with his daughter using a gun, because she has been expertly trained.

'I could have a fully loaded machine gun, and she would not dream of touching it because the curiosity factor has been eliminated,' he added.

Shyanne, who now has 20 sponsors backing her in competitions, takes on junior shooters, who are 18 or younger and has even begun entering adult tournaments.

Ambitions: At the end of October, she will square off against 200 of the top women shooters at the Brownell's Lady 3-Gun Pro-Am Challenge in Covington, Georgia

Last year, she came second in the Women's Division of the New Jersey Ruger Rimfire Challenge.

At the end of October, she will go up against 200 of the top women shooters at the Brownell's Lady 3-Gun Pro-Am Challenge in Covington, Georgia.

She is the youngest competitive shooter registered at the female-only event where the top performer has a chance to win $5,000, as well as items from a prize table of guns, ammo and more.

Her passion aside, she claims to also like playing soccer and hanging out with her friends. But she reiterated that shooting is what she 'really wants to do'. 

She lives 15 minutes from the shooting range and tries to fit in a 30-minute practice with a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun. But she insists her homework is a priority.
