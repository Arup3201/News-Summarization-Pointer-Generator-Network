A delicate pink peony perched atop her Jane Taylor hat and her neat Alexander McQueen coat falling in razor sharp pleated folds to her knees, the Duchess of Cambridge couldn't have chosen a more appropriate ensemble yesterday.

From the soft cream colour of the coat came a subtle nod to white, the colour of peace, while the summery bloom echoed the fresh flowers laid on the war memorial at St Symphorien cemetery in Mons by her husband, Prince William.

And the Duchess wasn't the only one to send a message with her clothes. Queen Mathilde of the Belgians chose a delicate soft blue, a colour redolent of motherhood, peace and tranquilty.

In 
Westminster Abbey, the Duchess of Cornwall, representing the Queen, 
chose an all-cream ensemble that mirrored her daughter-in-law's, while 
the monarch herself wore delicate primrose yellow as she remembered the 
fallen at Crathie Kirk in Balmoral.

The
 centenary of the outbreak of war was not a day for black mourning garb 
and poppies. At the time, the declaration of war was greeted with 
excitement as young men flocked to the recruiting offices.

Although
 some, among them Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, whose gloomy 
prediction that 'the lamps are going out all over Europe' inspired the 
Westminster Abbey service, were apprehensive, many more welcomed war.

That
 excitement swiftly turned to sorrow as the trenches filled up and 
millions perished makes the jubilation that greeted the outbreak of war 
all the more poignant.

Subtle: The monarch, like Camilla and Kate, picked a subtle coat and hat in a pale hue for her visit to the church

Poignant
 too were the letters read out during the service at St Symphorien, 
among them one from Private Michael Lennon to his brother Frank which 
was read out by Prince Harry and ended: 'I shall see you again when this
 is done.' He died a few days after the letter was written.

Also
 remembered were the Belgian victims of the first day of the Great War, 
with the city of Liège, the first port of call for the royal mourners, 
subjected to a fearsome bombardment and an 11 day siege.

'We were enemies more than once in the last century,' said Prince 
William during a speech made at the Inter-allied Memorial to President 
Joachim Gauck of Germany and President Francois Hollande of France among
 others. 'Today we are friends and allies.'

After
 commending the Belgian's fighting retreat on the 4th August 1914, he 
added: 'Their resistance was as gallant as their suffering was great.'

Next
 came the first major clash of the war: the Battle of Mons, which, 
although those joyous soldiers signing up 100 years ago yesterday didn't
 know it, would turn into a bloodstained disaster.

At St Symphorien, the graves include those of 229 
British and Commonwealth soldiers and 284 Germans, the majority of whom 
were killed during the battle.

The fighting, which began with a British attempt to hold the Mons–Condé Canal fail after a 
sudden French retreat, lasted for more than two weeks.

Although the German army came close to taking Paris, British and French victories in the Battle of the Marne that followed saw the invaders pushed back before the war got bogged down in stalemate and trenches.

But on the 4th August 1914, none of the men then signing up knew that and they wouldn't know for some time to come.

The Duchess in her cream coat and the little girl dressed in white who released a matching balloon during the Liège ceremony were both offering a sartorial tribute to the precious thing those men willingly threw away - peace. It would be another four years before they saw it again.
