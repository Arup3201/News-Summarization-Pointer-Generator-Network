The wife of the Sydney man Mohamed Elomar who is fighting with the extremist group ISIS in Syria, has been ordered to face court next week over charges she was preparing to travel to Syria to join the jihadi front.

Fatima Elomar, 30, will appear in person at the Downing Centre court in central Sydney after Magistrate Lisa Stapleton told her lawyer that any further delays in the case were 'unacceptable'.

On Tuesday, Ms Stapleton flatly rejected an application by Elomar's latest lawyer, Muhammad Tehseldar, to have her case adjourned for a further three weeks.

Citing the fact it had been before the same court for mention seven times since Elomar's arrest by counter terrorism police in May last year, Ms Stapleton described any further delay as 'unacceptable'.

 'She must be ready for committal or arraignment," Magistrate Stapleton said and order Elomar to appear on February 3.

Enough is enough: Sydney magistrate Lisa Stapleton has ordered Fatima Elomar (pictured) to appear at the Downing Centre court in central Sydney next week on terrorism charges, saying any further legal delays were 'unacceptable'

Be ready: Fatima Elomar (pictured, getting into her  black Jeep Patriot following her last court appearance last November) has had her case up for mention seven times, but a magistrate has now demanded that the Brisbane mother face an arraignment or committal hearing

Poster boy: Ms Elomar's husband, Mohamed Elomar (pictured allegedly holding the severed heads of Syrian government soldiers) has become one of the Australian 'poster boys' for the extremist group ISIS since he travelled to war-torn Syria last year

New lawyer: Fatima Elomar (pictured at Goulburn Street parking station in central Sydney with her previous lawyer, Zali Burrows) has now appointed solicitor Muhammad Tehseldar, but his application to further postpone her case was rejected by magistrate Lisa Stapleton

Elomar, who is the mother of Sydney ISIS recruit Mohamed Elomar's four children, was arrested trying to board an international flight earlier this year to allegedly join husband Mohamed in Syria. She was allegedly carrying cash and camouflage clothing. 

Joint counter terrorism detectives arrested and charged Elomar with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities.

She has since appeared before a number of Sydney magistrates and last appealed to Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan in November not to have to appear personally in January because she had a baby to look after.

The accused, whose face has been uncovered during her brief court hearings, has always donned a a full-face niqab when leaving the court complex for the street.

During one court appearance, for which she brought along her four children, the family group all left court draped in cloths and blankets.

Time's up: Fatima Elomar (pictured in full-face niqab on the street, right, and, left, with her previous lawyer, Zali Burrows) will now be arraigned on February 3 to face charges of preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities

Final appearance: Fatima Elomar pulls out of the parking station following her appearance at Downing Centre Court. Her lawyer Zali Burrow (pictured in Ms Elomar's Jeep) has successfully applied for Ms Elomar not to appear in person at the next court hearing because she has a baby to look after

Hoped reunion: Fatima Elomar (pictured, left, leaving court last year with her four children draped in sheets and cloths) is the wife of Mohamed Elomar (right) and  mother of his four children. She was caught last May allegedly trying to leave the country to join husband, Mohamed Elomar (right) in Syria

High court bid: Fatima Elomar (above) with her former lawyer, Zali Burrows, leaving a central Sydney court after she briefly appeared on foreign incursion charges may still lodge an appeal against the Federal Government laying terrorism charges, saying the matters are unconstitutional

Ms Elomar has maintained since her arrest that she was travelling to Malaysia on holiday with her with her two young sons, daughter and baby.

In the ensuing months last year, her husband Mohamed Elomar  became one of ISIS's 'poster' Aussie terrorists, posing in the besieged Syrian town of al Raqqa with a pair of severed heads and posting the photos on social media.

Through her lawyer, Ms Elomar has said she is a ‘devoted mother’ of her four children and described the charges against her as ‘serious and over-zealous’.

In a statement released following her arrest last year, Ms Elomar said her children had suffered enough from not being able to visit Malaysia for the holiday, and by being questioned by detectives.

'The ordeal of being interviewed without their mother, being unable to return home to their friends and school, having to adjust to a new way of life of reporting in to the police station with mum, and the task of trying to make new friends at a new school in a new state,’ Ms Elomar said in the statement.

Ms Elomar's husband, Mohamed, is the nephew of convicted terrorist Mohamed Elomar, who plotted with four other men in 2005 to bomb targets in a bid to force Australia's government to change its policy on Middle East conflicts.

Mohamed Elomar Snr is  still wielding significant influence over would-be Australian jihadis, despite the fact he is being held in Australia's Supermax jail in Goulburn, NSW, the Australian reports.

Mr Elomar is believed to have flown to Syria in 2013 with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport.

Mr Sharrouf has also posted photographs of himself and his children allegedly from Syria on social media, with one of his sons posing with a severed head. 

Ms Elomar said last year through Ms Burrows that her arrest highlighted the pitfalls for travellers packing camouflage gear as a fashion item.

'At the end of the day this is an example of one must be careful what you pack to travel, let it be a travel warning to leave the camouflage pants at home and best check with Smart Traveller as to what the acceptable fashion is,’ she said.

Ms Elomar will be arraigned on February 3.
