Business Secretary Vince Cable hit out at the Government’s controversial charity tax last night saying the move could strip leading universities of millions of pounds a year in donations.

Oxford and Cambridge vice chancellors have privately written to George Osbourne over his plan, which is attracting growing opposition from within the Conservative cabinet.

Mr Cable said the proposals would have potentially serious consequences for many ‘genuine’ charities – a claim denied by the Treasury.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also said 
to be alarmed by the proposals, which have been criticised by an 
anti-poverty group founded by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan 
Smith.

Clash: Business Secretary Vince Cable has 
made it clear that he is 'sympathetic' to concerns raised by 
universities that funding for scholarships and research could be 
affected by Mr Osborne's proposal

He said he had been contacted by leading universities concerned that they could lose vital private sector cash at a time when they are facing cuts in state funding.

He said: ‘Obviously I am 100 per cent behind efforts to crack down on abusive tax avoidance – wealthy people must pay their share. But we have got to separate out that issue from genuine charitable donations.

‘Universities come within my department and they are concerned about this. For some universities this is a big deal because they get large sums in one-off payments from individual donors, which could be caught by this.

‘What is happening is that genuine charities have been caught up in something that was not intended to affect them.’

In a letter to Mr Osbourne, Andrew Hamilton, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, warned the tax "risks undermining the culture" of university philanthropy, according to The Times.

A university spokesman said: "The generosity of Oxford's donors provides huge public benefit, contributing to teaching, research and student bursaries.

Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge has also written a private letter to Mr Osborne expressing his concern, the paper said.

Chancellor George Osborne’s decision to cap tax relief for charitable giving has provoked a storm of protest from charities.

David Bull, executive director of Unicef in the UK, warned the move would have dire consequences for the poor. He said: ‘The poorest and most vulnerable children will pay the price, and they could pay the price with their lives.’

Arts Council England warned at least £80million in regular donations to its organisations was at risk, while a new £55million ‘matched funding’ scheme with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport could also be in jeopardy.

Faith-based charities also criticised the move. In an open letter, Christian Aid, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, Islamic Relief, Jewish Care and Muslim Aid warned the ‘misguided’ proposal would have a serious impact on their activities.

Concerns: Arts Council England chair Dame Liz Forgan said donations to arts organisations were likely to suffer, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, is said to be worried by the proposals

They said: ‘We ask the Government urgently to reconsider this proposal so that it tackles any potential abuse, but protects the life-saving philanthropy David Cameron has rightly praised in the past.’

Mr Cable’s intervention sparked fury at the Treasury, where sources pointed out that the cap had been introduced partly to help pay for Liberal Democrat demands to raise the income tax threshold to £9,200.

A source said: ‘Vince’s position seems to be a bit confused. He is setting himself against a policy that is designed to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share of tax and that helps cut tax for people on lower and middle incomes – a policy that Nick Clegg has made a big priority.’

Yesterday, as it emerged that independent schools could also be hit by the proposals, universities said Mr Cable was right to raise concerns.

Dr Wendy Piatt, director-general of the Russell Group of 20 leading universities, said: ‘Our institutions are increasingly reliant on charitable giving as we strive to remain world-class. Anything that could reduce philanthropic donations would be of huge concern to us and we urge the Government to clarify the implications of this announcement.’

Treasury sources also revealed that the controversial plan might raise as little as £60million a year – of which only a fraction relates to abuse of the rules. Sources in the charitable sector suggested this would equate to losses of about £300million a year for good causes.

The new proposals would cap the amount an individual can give to charity before incurring tax at £50,000 a year or a quarter of their total income, whichever is higher.

Ministers claim the scheme remains ‘generous’ and will prevent abuse by individuals who give money to questionable charities, often abroad, in order to avoid tax.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said the policy had been ‘set out for extremely good reasons’. He acknowledged there had been ‘controversy’ about the proposal, but said ministers would work with charities and philanthropists ‘to ensure the removal of the tax relief does not have a significant impact on charities which depend on large donations’.

On Wednesday Mr Cameron indicated that ministers were considering a partial climbdown in order to limit the damage to charities. But yesterday it remained unclear what form this would take. Former Tory leadership candidate David Davis last night said the problem could be fixed without imposing a damaging cap as most of the alleged abuse was already against the law.

He said: ‘The abuse being talked about is not tax avoidance, it is concealed tax evasion. We do not need any new laws, we need better enforcement. They are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.’

Labour accused ministers of presiding over a shambles and said the Chancellor appeared to be ‘increasingly isolated’.

The Treasury yesterday refused for a third day running to reveal how many tycoons it  believes are abusing the rules on charitable donations to dodge tax.

A reliable source told the Mail that the heavy-handed clampdown on charitable  giving was prompted by concerns about the tax affairs of just seven wealthy individuals and their families.

The Treasury took four hours to respond to the claim yesterday before indicating the true level of abuse was higher.

But a spokesman refused to say how many people ministers believe are bending or breaking the rules. And he muddied the waters by saying the policy was not just about tackling abuse, but about ensuring all individuals pay a minimum level of tax.

The Treasury would not comment on why it was being so secretive about the scale of a supposed loophole it has already announced it is closing.

The spokesman said: ‘This is not just about a handful of people – there is a lot of it going on. But this is not just about the abuse – there is also a  broader principle of people paying a certain level of tax.’

The Treasury claims that the controversial cap on tax relief for charitable donations is essential in stamping out tax-dodging.

Sources claim some wealthy individuals channel vast sums into charitable trusts  with the benefit of tax relief before moving the funds to a charity abroad and withdrawing the cash once it is away from the eyes of British authorities.

Another scam involves channelling money into charitable trusts that give only a small amount to genuine charities. The rest of the cash is lent to the donor’s companies or spent on lavish parties dressed up as charitable fundraising events.

Critics, including the influential Tory backbencher David Davis, point out that both scams are already illegal and could be tackled by better enforcement of the existing laws rather than a draconian cap that risks damaging genuine charities.

The Treasury’s own figures suggest the amount of abuse involved is relatively small. Budget figures state that capping a series of tax reliefs will generate about £300million for the taxpayer. But the Treasury acknowledged yesterday that as little as £60million of this relates to charitable giving.

But the impact on the charitable sector could be more than £300million a year.

According to the Treasury the top 20 individuals affected by the changes reduced their tax bills by £145million last year by using various uncapped tax reliefs.

But almost two-thirds of this related to tax relief on business losses. Only 20 per cent involved tax relief on charitable giving.
