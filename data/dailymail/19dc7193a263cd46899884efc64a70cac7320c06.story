A new phone app calculates how many cows a South African bride-to-be is worth.

The 'Lobola Calculator ' - Lobola means bride price, or dowry - calculates a woman's marital value and then determines what she is worth based on the dowry averages in different South African provinces, which vary.

In Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, the average Lobola is 12 cows, or £893. 

A new phone app calculates how many cows a South African bride-to-be is worth based on her personal and physical attributes and the average dowry paid in provinces across the continent 

The app was created as a way for giving men a 'ballpark figure' on what they will need to pay their bride-to-be's family, but was also said to be 'great for a laugh with friends'

The app requests the users age, height, weight and waist size and asks them to rate their attractiveness on a scale of 'not at all' to 'really hot'. But the calculations aren't simply based on physical attributes, the app also bases its calculations on a woman's educational qualifications, their job and whether they have been married before or have children. 

Developer Robert Matsaneng describes the app as 'great for getting a ballpark figure if you're planning on proposing soon, great for breaking the ice on a date lol, great for a laugh with friends.' 

A disclaimer on a website for the app says the Lobola Calculator is 'just for entertainment and is not intended to replace the true culture and protocols of lobola'. 

The app is only currently available for Android devices, but it is being developed for iOS and BlackBerry. It also determines lobola for a man.

In Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, the average dowry is 12 cows, or £893

But South African's have been quick to see the funny side and have taken to Twitter to reveal their labola scores, using the hashtag - #Lobolacalculator

One reviewer praised the Lobola Calculator as 'innovative and relevant,' and a 'fun guideline' for South African men planning to marry. 

However, some of the feedback has been less constructive, with the Global Post reporting that commentators have requested the developer add extra metric to the equation, suggesting women should also be ranked according to their ethnicity, class and ability to cook.
