About 20 Florida manatees been freed from a storm drain near Cape Canaveral, Florida, where they are believed to have gotten stuck in search of warmer water amid the Florida cold-snap.

Rescue workers are continuing the effort to save the seacows today,but the total number of manatees stuck in the culvert is not yet known.

Officials said the warmth-loving creatures, which can weigh up to half a ton, were likely following warm freshwater out of frigid seawater into the underground drains when they became stuck. 

Desperate rescue: Rescuers with SeaWorld and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission brought in earth moving equipment in a desperate bid to pull 17 trapped manatees out of a coastal community's storm culvert 

Workers first hauled the endangered mammals out one-by-one before winching them up to ground level, assessing them for injuries and then lowering them back into a nearby waterway

Looking for warmth: The animals were likely trying to find warmth inside the culverts, but did not have room to turn back around, nor can they swim backwards

Video footage show a rescuer comforting one manatee floating at the opening of the pipe, which was cut open during the hours-long rescue.

The footage, posted online by Central Florida News 13 and Florida Today newspaper, also showed a manatee being carried in a sling to a nearby canal, where it was released to cheers from onlookers, and two other manatees being petted after being hoisted out of the water by heavy machinery.

A team from SeaWorld and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have been working along with police and firefighters,since yesterday.  

Inside the culverts, the manatees do not have room to turn back around, nor can they swim backwards. 

The Sunshine State has experienced a serious cold snap in recent days and temperatures have dropped low enough to threaten the endangered mammals' lives.  

Rescued: Among the first manatees pulled out were a calf and its mother. Their state of health was not immediately known but they, like all the manatees, were released back into a nearby waterway

After using earth moving equipment to pull out the manatees, a rescue worker assessed each's health before they were lifted once again and placed back in safe waters

Not winter hard: Here, scores of West Indian manatees huddle near a freshwater spring at Three Sisters Springs inside the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge in Crystal River, Fla. The warm-blooded aquatic creatures which live in the shallow confines of the river seek the warmth of the 72-degree spring water when temperatures plummet

'It's been cold lately and these canals are all filled with manatees,' Satellite Beach Fire Chief Don Hughes said.

'I wouldn't even begin to venture a guess as to how they got into the drainage pipes. They will go wherever there's warm water.'

Rescuers brought heavy earth-moving equipment to the Satellite Beach neighborhood, located on a barrier island along the Atlantic Ocean.

Workers were expected to be there through the evening as they desperately tried to pull the creatures from what would otherwise become their grave.

Among the first of the manatees, also known as sea cows, pulled one-by-one from the drain were a mother and her calf.   

After using earth moving equipment to pull out the manatees, a rescue worker assessed each's health before they were lifted once again and placed back in safe waters.
