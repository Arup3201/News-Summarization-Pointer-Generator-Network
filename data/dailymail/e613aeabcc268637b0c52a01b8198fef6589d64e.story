It might seem an unusual accomplishment for a banker from the big end of town, but Harrison Young isn't concerned with what other people think.

Mr Young, who is a director Australia's Commonwealth Bank, has just launched his second saucy novel: 'Submission: Lessons from the desert'.

'I'm sure there are colleagues who think it's foolish, but I say: sex and laughter? What's not to like?' 

'Submission' is the second piece of erotic fiction by former soldier and director of the Commonwealth Bank, Harrison Young

'Submission' is an erotic thriller set in Alibi, a fictional middle-eastern country where 'perfection is tangible, women are invisible' and 'warmth is a drug.'

According to Cassandra, the 'all-seeing secretary' to Alibi's Prime Minister, and one of the novel's central characters, it's a place where people come to make their fortunes.

'So the expatriate compounds are full of ambitious, oversexed fools,' she tells the reader. 

Harrison Young says the title does make people wonder. 

'You can't write any good story about adults without sex and certainly, there are a few scenes in the book that are a bit confronting,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

In Submission, Young draws on his pre-corporate life as a Special Forces officer in the US Army to tell the story of three ex-pats; their 'spiritual awakenings' and their passions in Arabia.

There's Philip, a New York lawyer and Vietnam veteran who has been sent by his firm to advise Alidir's Prime Minister  - though he's not quite sure why. There's Allison Baxter, a 'sincere' American with an absent banker husband and there's Cassandra, the  gorgeous secretary and a former high-end-call girl who takes a fancy to Philip.

'It's an action movie in prose,' says Young. 'It presents as a literary thriller, spy stuff, and gradually turns into a love story with a fair amount of self awareness for Philip and a degree of spiritual awakening for the two women,' he tells Daily Mail Australia. 

Young says his early experiences in the army helped him build Philip's character in the novel. 

'It's in the way he sees the world, his attitude to violence and the way you always know where you stand with him,' he says. 'I think anyone who's served in the American Army will get some good laughs from the book.'

Young says the setting for Submission was inspired by six months he spent living in Bahrain, where he was sent by international firm Morgan Stanley in 1991. He spent a lot of time in a hotel room with not enough to do.

'It was the kind of place where you heard the first half of a joke at someone's lunch and you'd hear the punchline  at someone else's dinner,' said Young.  'I realised very quickly that I could either become an alcoholic or try writing.'  

In fact, Young began writing much earlier, beginning his professional life as a journalist with a four-month gig at the Washington Post. 

He says he soon decided he didn't want to write about what other people do, but felt he didn't have any stories of his own to tell. 

'I stopped writing for 18 years then finally thought, maybe I'd had enough life experience now.'   

I always wanted to write but didn't think I had a story to tell: The Commonwealth Bank Director and former US Army officer, pictured here in 1970 in Okinawa, actually began his career as a journalist in Washington DC. 

So how does Young find the time to write around  his demanding responsibilities with one of Australia's biggest banks?

'We always find time for the things we love,' he says.  

The other thing Harrison Young loves, and something he's famous for, is giving 'brilliant, animated dinner parties.' 

'I always try to have a mixture of people - you don't want big bankers sitting around a table talking to themselves, that would just be boring - you want artists, academics, journalists, a diversity of people.'

Certainly, Young's own story has been a diverse one. Do his dinner guests enjoy his books?

'Well they say they do!'  

Submission: Lessons from the desert by Harrison Young is available through Jane Curry Publishing.  Young's first erotic novel, 'Partners: love is a law unto itself' was called  the business world’s equivalent of E.L. James’ hit novel Fifty Shades of Grey.

Dr. Maloof allowed another silence to grow between them. Allison forced herself not to fidget, but she found it impossible to hold his gaze.

“Miss Prime, you are direct, so I will be direct. I would like you to take off your clothes.”

Allison flushed. “For money?” She didn’t know what had made her say that.

“Certainly not. For the experience. I judge that you have never done it before, for a man.”

Allison stood up and began.

“You are charmingly awkward,” he said. “It is better to start with your shoes, and sitting down. But never mind, you are doing fine. Hang your dress in the closet. There are hangers. Put everything in there and close the door.”

“Now what?”

“Sit back down. No, over there on the couch. You are extremely pleasant to look at.” Silence. “Change your position from time to time, so that I may appreciate all of you. You look fit. Do you run?”

“Every morning.” Allison’s throat was dry and her voice cracked a little.

“Would you like a glass of water?”

“Yes, please.” Allison started to rise.

“No, don’t move. I am happy to wait on you.” He went in to his kitchen and returned with an expensive looking tumbler of ice water. He set it on the table beside her and she drank.

He returned to his chair.

“Better?”

“Yes.”

“You have a dignity about you that I like.”

“It is surprising,” said Allison, “but I am not at all ashamed.”

“There is no reason to be.”

“My pulse is racing, though.”

“Of course it is.”

“I wish it would calm down.”

“That is quite unnecessary. The point is to give me aesthetic pleasure – for you are a lovely woman – and to give yourself an interesting experience.”

“I am not sure I’d call myself a woman.”

“You are on the verge of womanhood.”

“How reassuring.” For the first time, she laughed.

“If you ever are ashamed, there is pleasure to be taken in that too, you know?”
