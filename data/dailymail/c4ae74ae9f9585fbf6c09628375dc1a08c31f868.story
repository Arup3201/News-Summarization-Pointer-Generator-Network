The father of one of three teens in Florida charged with the horrifically violent school bus attack last month said that his son is 'sorry' for his part in the beating.

Speaking outside of Pinellas County Courthouse today, Julian McKnight said that his son Julian, 15, was contrite over his role in the attack after he appeared along with Lloyd Khemradj and Joshua Reddin to be charged with aggravated battery.

'All I can say is that he had his consequences already, you know?' said McKnight. 'This is life. I am sorry what happened to the victim. It's just the way it is. My son ain't never been no bad person, he just got mixed with bad people, that's all...He's sorry.'

Sorry: Julian McKnight said his son, also called, Julian, 15, was sorry for his role in the beating of a 13-year-old boy on a Florida school bus in St. Petersburg last month

All three of the 15-year-olds are first time offenders and are due back in the juvenile court on August 27th where prosecutors will seek a sentence of nine months of probation for the suspects, no contact with the victim and random drug testing.

The attack on the bus which made national headlines and caused outrage across the country came after the unidentified 13-year-old victim told officials at Lealman Intermediate School that one of them attempted to sell him marijuana.

The three boys were captured on surveillance video camera on the bus landing 50 blows onto the younger teen, leaving him with a broken arm and two black eyes according to Fox News.

The bus driver in Gulfport, Florida who made the desperate call for help as he witnessed three teens brutally punch and stomp a younger student and won’t face charges despite video that shows he did not physically intervene.

Pinellas County driver John Moody, 64, put in a call to his dispatcher as he watched three 15-year-olds attack a 13-year-old, breaking the boy’s arm and leaving him with two black eyes.

‘You gotta get somebody here quick, quick, quick, quick,’ Moody could be heard pleading in surveillance footage as the victim moaned with each kick and punch. 'They are about to beat this boy to death.'

Additional charge: Joshua Reddin is also charged with unarmed robbery for allegedly stealing the victim's money

The 18-year veteran did not try to 
stop the attack himself, which led Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent 
to pursue criminal charges.

‘There
was clearly an opportunity for him to intervene and or check on the 
welfare of the children or the child in this case, and he didn't make 
any effort to do so,’ Vincent told WFLA.

However,
Moody was not required to help the beaten boy under Pinellas County 
rules. While some jurisdictions completely ban a driver from stepping in
when fights occur, the Florida county merely allows a driver to do so 
if he or she feels it is safe.

Moody followed protocol, say officials, by radioing for help.

‘Please get somebody here quick. There's still doing it,’ Moody said in footage from the scene. ‘There's nothing I can do.’

In fact, Moody says he was traumatized by the event  and has since retired.

‘I had many sleepless nights,’ he told CNN. ‘I had nightmares.’

Moody described the fight and subsequent controversy as the ‘final straw…and it was a big straw, too.’

‘Me
jumping in the middle of that fight with three boys,’ he told CNN, ‘it 
would have been more dangerous for other students on the bus for as 
myself. There's just no telling what might have happened.’

Savage: The controversy began when footage taken from a student's cell phone showed the brutal beating and Moody not helping

Helpless? John Moody radioed for help but did not intervene as three boys, all 15, aboard his Gulfport, Florida school bus savagely beat a 13-year-old on July 9

'Quick, quick, quick!': Gulfport Police Chief Robert Vincent initially accused Moody of neglect, but video shows he followed protocol by asking dispatchers to get to the scene

Police say the victim was targeted because he was offered marijuana by one of the attackers and then reported the attempted drug sale to school administrators.

In spite of this, all the boys were allowed to board the bus together, which Moody’s attorney says points to a problem at the school.

Brutal: The 13-year-old victim walked away with two black eyes and a broke arm

Nightmarish: Pinellas County, Florida school district rules allow a bus driver to intervene in a fight but does not require them to. Moody, 64, says the attack has left him with nightmares. He retired two weeks following the fight

‘School officials let these two boys back on the bus, or let them on the bus, and Mr. Moody had no idea what had happened at the school,’ Frank McDermott said.

Now the three accused attackers are charged with felony aggravated battery. One of the boys is also charged with unarmed robbery, having allegedly stolen the victim’s money during the attack.

McDermott says his client deserves an apology from local Gulfport police.
