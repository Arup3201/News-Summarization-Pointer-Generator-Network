His face covered in blood and screaming 
in agony as a medical worker cares for his wounded leg, this iconic picture of Eric Whalley caught the full horror of the Boston bombings.

The wounded 65-year-old, who is now on the road to recovery, is a British expatriate who swapped rural Cumbria for Massachusetts as he started a new life.

The retired pharmacologist and his wife Ann, 65, who was also hurt in the explosion, moved to the US in 1989 with their two sons.

Horror: Eric Whalley, 65, is treated by medics after being caught up in the Boston bombings

The couple remain in hospital after suffering serious injuries in the blast, but are now both awake and are 
spending time together in a shared room.

Their sons Richard, 25, and Chris, 34, who both live in America, only learnt their parents had been wounded via the internet. They have launched an online drive to raise $200,000 to pay their medical bills.

Mr and Mrs Whalley, who were childhood sweethearts at Cockermouth Grammar School, were going for a walk on marathon day when they were caught up in the terror attack.

Mr Whalley lost part of his right 
foot, suffered damage to his eyesight and brain trauma but has since 
regained consciousness and has been able to speak.

His wife was placed on a respirator
and will require major leg surgery. They have had nearly 12 operations 
between them to remove ball bearings and nails.

When Mr Whalley woke up for the first time after the disaster, his son Richard told him he was on the frontpage of the Daily Mail - and he started laughing.

Childhood sweethearts: Eric and Ann Whalley, both 65, moved to the US with their two sons in 1989 after growing up in Cockermouth

'He
was just barely talking, but he was understanding what we said,' Richard said. 'I told him his photo was on the front page of the
Daily Mail. He started laughing.'

Mr and Mrs Whalley both grew up in Cockermouth and still have friends living in the area. After nearly 20 years in the US, they became American citizens in 2008.

In school, accomplished student Mr Whalley captained his rugby first team and the athletics squad, was on the cross country team, and was also a house captain and prefect.

After leaving school he studied at the University of London and at Bradford before lecturing in pharmacology at the University of Manchester for 14 years.

He later moved with his wife, a teacher, to the US so he could take up a pharmacology job.

John Partridge, who went to school with Mr Whalley in Cockermouth, now lives in Indiana, USA.

Fear: Richard Whalley wrote that he was worried his mother was dead in the hours after the bombing when he saw images of his wounded father online

Retirement: Mr Whalley is a retired pharmacologist while his wife Ann is an ex-teacher. The couple have two sons Richard, 25, and Chris, 34

Brutality of the bombings: Caked in dirt and debris and covered in blood, Mr Whalley is wheeled away into an ambulance after the terror attack

He said: 'I found out the terrible news about the Whalleys via my mother who still lives in Cockermouth.

'I knew Eric very well as a young man.
He lived on Woodside Avenue, which was off Kirkfell Avenue in 
Cockermouth where I lived, so we basically played together. He was very 
keen on sports.

'I knew his parents very well, and his dad came to Cockermouth to work at Millers shoe factory when they opened it.

'Eric was a couple of years behind me at Cockermouth Grammar School and I believe he and his wife were childhood sweethearts.'

Mrs Whalley's sister Patricia Underwood 
still lives in Cockermouth and it is understood she has another sister 
in Harrington and cousins in Maryport.

Both Mr and Mrs Whalley have now come out of intensive care, but will require at least two more weeks of hospital treatment and extensive rehabilitation.

Richard Whalley and his brother have set up a website to help pay for their parents' medical expenses

Their son Richard only realised they were hurt after seeing his father's photograph on the internet.

After spotting the image, which was being used by several news outlets, Richard posted: 'This is my dad in the picture in this link. I have no idea where my mum is. They were both bombed.

'I'm trying to figure out what hospital they are at. Can you help? They look pretty severely injured and I'm worried my mum is dead.'

When he tried to find them there was no record of them at any of the hospitals.

More than 200 people were injured in the explosion and they had been registered under the wrong names in the ensuing chaos.

After staff were asked to double check, the Whalleys were tracked down to separate medical centres.

Updates on their condition have been posted on the Give Forward website where the Ann and Eric Recovery Fund has been created and has raised more than $128,400 for their treatment

The family has pledged that anything left over from the fund which is not required will be spent on helping other marathon bombing victims.
