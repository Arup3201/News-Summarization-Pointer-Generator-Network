A team of cadaver dogs will search Plano, Texas, for the body of a 23-year-old woman who was last seen leaving a party three months ago. 

Christina Morris walked into a shopping mall garage with a male friend on August 30 but she never drove out, surveillance footage showed.

Despite searching ponds, lakes, fields, and buildings, and combing through Morris's texts, police and a private investigator have failed to uncover any new information.

Missing: Cadaver dogs will search for the body of Christina Morris, 23, who went missing on August 30 after a party. She was last seen walking into a garage at 4am that day. This (left) is the last picture taken of her

Morris lives with her boyfriend who failed to report her missing, her parents Ronnie and Jonnie McElroy said. 

It wasn't until September 3, when Morris didn't turn up to work, that police were alerted to the case by her employer.

Police released surveillance footage showing her entering The Shops at Legacy parking garage around 4am Saturday with a male friend.

According to the family's private investigator Paula Boudreaux, the search team is struggling to find witnesses willing to offer information.

'It is very frustrating, because you have people with information who don't want to talk,' Boudreaux told NBC. 'Everybody is afraid.'

Morris lives with her boyfriend, but he didn't report her missing until four days later when she didn't show up for work and her boss called. Morris pictured left in a picture with an unidentified man, posted to her Facebook 

The close friend she was seen walking with has been questioned and police do not consider him a suspect in the disappearance. 

'He goes to the right to his car. He gets in his car and he leaves,' Officer David Tilley, a Plano Police spokesperson, told CBS Dallas/Fort Worth. 'She went the other way. From there, we don't really know what happened.'

Morris' bank accounts have not been accessed and her cell phone is turned off or dead. 

The last 15 calls were to her boyfriend. And police say there was no sign of foul play or a struggle near her car. 

Her parents organized a search of the area around the shopping mall in early September, but it turned up no new evidence.

'We can't sleep,' Mrs McElroy said. 'I have two different visions… in one vision I see her smile, I feel her touch. And I also vision the worst. And I don't like that at all.'

'If my daughter is alive out there, somebody knows.' 

Morris is described as 5-foot-4, 100 pounds with brown eyes and blonde hair.
