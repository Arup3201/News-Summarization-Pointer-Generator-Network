The Mediterranean has become 'another Somalia', Italy's naval chief has warned, as criminal gangs importing migrants to Europe by the thousand wreak havoc on the high seas.

Admiral Giuseppe De Giorgi, head of the Italian Navy, said that the influx of migrants had grown 'exponentially' in the last few months to reach 'Biblical proportions'.

It comes as the UN today said that an estimated 6,000 Syrian and Eritrean migrants, including women and newborn babies, have been rescued by Italy's navy in four days, while thousands more asylum seekers keen to reach Europe have gathered in Libya.

Italy has been forced to step up military efforts to match the surge in trafficking operations, he said, but was fighting a losing battle.

The emergency comes as Italy's interior minister, Angelino Alfano, warned that more than half a million migrants are ready to set sail from North Africa.

Since October last year almost 19,000 migrants have landed on the Italian coastline, roughly a ten-fold increase on the year before. British experts believe one in five continue on to the UK.

Italy's southernmost island, Lampedusa, 70 miles off Tunisia, is the gateway for illegal migrants entering Europe.

More than 40,000 people made the crossing to Italy last year, often in crowded and unseaworthy boats.

Admiral De Giorgi said the number of migrants entering Italy by boat surged by 300 per cent in 2013.

Following a tragic shipwreck off the island of Lampedusa that killed some 300 migrants, the military's search and rescue operation was stepped up. 

The Italians were forced to up their numbers to 900 Navy seamen engaged to combat the trafficking, he said.

'But we know there are 600,000 or 700,000 waiting in camps. Even though 350 people died –it makes no difference to the influx.'

Arrested: More than sixty traffickers have been arrested since last October, and face up to 13 years prison each

Conversely the improved rescue operation, following the accident, 'has created a boom,' in landings, he said, with up to six boats a day calling for rescue, often hundreds of miles from shore. He said: 'The Mediterranean used to be a peaceful lake. Now it is another Somalia.' 

In one incident the Italian Navy stalked a 'mother ship' carrying Egyptian traffickers for four hours using submarines, before successfully capturing it in a daring chase across the high seas.

He said: 'We were following the mother ship with a submarine. The traffickers herded all the migrants into a dinghy, gave them a satellite phone and pointed them in the right direction for land.

'It then turned and headed back towards Egypt at full speed. One of our frigates gave chase firing warning shots, but they would not stop.

'Eventually the frigate fired on the rudders to disable the ship and we were able to capture her and the traffickers on board.' 

More than sixty traffickers have been arrested since last October, and face up to 13 years prison each.

Under EU rules migrants are obliged to remain in the country where they first seek asylum. But most want to head to northern Europe were there are more job opportunities and generous benefits.
