Carl Froch's dream of a career-defining night in Las Vegas against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr is closer to becoming a reality.

The super middleweight world champion, who last fought in May when he knocked out George Groves at Wembley, has long craved a fight in Sin City.

And his promoter Eddie Hearn is confident a deal can be reached for him to take on Chavez in March after productive talks with the Mexican's advisor Al Haymon.

Carl Froch has been out of action since knocking out George Groves at Wembley in May

Froch defended his WBA and IBF titles with his ninth-round win over his British rival at the home of football

'I'm more hopeful than ever that the fight will happen, hopefully at the end of March,' he told Sportsmail.

'There's a dispute between Chavez and Top Rank but the kid's got to fight. Sooner or later that will be resolved and when it does, I believe Froch-Chavez will be made.'

Froch has until December 31 to decide he wants to vacate his IBF title or face mandatory challenger James DeGale.

'We have to make a decision and Froch can either ask for an exemption, fight DeGale or vacate,' Hearn added.

Chavez is an icon in Mexico and would ensure Froch gets his big night in Las Vegas before he retires 

'As far as Carl is concerned, he's not phoning me up every day asking me if it's done. I phoned him last night and told him to get his running shoes ready just incase.

'He's ready to go, he's been studying Chavez and he's walking around 10lb over the limit already.

'The only time scale comes from the pressure from the IBF and the fact we represent James.

'We will be transparent with them and Carl will too. He doesn't need to hold on to belts.

'I think you'll see something being delivered in the next few weeks.'
