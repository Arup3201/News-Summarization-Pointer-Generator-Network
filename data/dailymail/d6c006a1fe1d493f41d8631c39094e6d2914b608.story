It took 40 volunteers several days to plant 2,000 trees intended to form a Diamond Jubilee wood.

It took a blundering council worker only a few minutes to chop the lot down.

The young saplings were hidden by long grass in a hay meadow at Nidd Gorge, Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

‘The council had told the grass cutter where to go, but he went off piste and wiped out the young trees,’ said Keith Wilkinson, chairman of the Bilton Grange Conservation Group which carried out the planting in December.

‘It is a real shame. The mower has just ripped most of them from the ground. Only a couple of shredded oaks have survived. It is disheartening for the volunteers. It is sad to have lost all that work.’

The planting was part of a nationwide Woodland Trust scheme which saw the planting of six million trees to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

The saplings were of oak, rowan, hazel, holly, cherry, crab apple, hawthorn, blackthorn, birch and elder to mimic the natural make-up of woodland in the area.

Harrogate Borough Council has apologised and promised to replace them by the end of the year.

A spokesman said: ‘It was decided not to use tree guards for the saplings because such guards have attracted vandals.

'The council will also be reviewing its procedures to make sure that such a mistake will not happen again.’
