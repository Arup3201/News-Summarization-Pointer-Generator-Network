Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts has accused a man of stalking her and even threatening to hit punch in the face

Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts has accused a man of stalking her and even threatening to punch her in the face.

Troy Warren, 43, appeared outside ABC’s Time Square studios at least eight times and threatened her, according to court records.

It is alleged that between June 10 and June 24 Warren turned up at her place of work and asked to see the show host.

'When I see her I’m going to punch her in the face,' Warren told the security director of the programme.

'Due to the defendant’s above described conduct Ms Robin Roberts fears for her physical safety and well-being,' court records show. 

Warren was arrested and arraigned Wednesday in Manhattan Criminal Court on misdemeanor stalking and harassment raps.

A judge set bail at $3,000.

In the same month a knife-wielding homeless man allegedly stormed the studio threatening to kill Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan. 

Andre Johnson, 25, allegedly tried to stab a security guard with a serrated knife near the show's New York City set, before being tackled by a police officer.

When questioned by cops, Johnson said: 'I was there to kill Michael Strahan.'
