Ex-Tory Minister Michael Fabricant went public yesterday to denounce claims that he was in ‘a feud’ with Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU) boss Iain Corby.

Mr Fabricant, sacked as Tory vice-chairman last week, revealed he told party chiefs of concerns about the PRU’s ‘drinking culture’ three years ago – but no action was taken.

He complained to senior Tory MP Oliver Heald, former chairman of the PRU, after he was approached by two PRU officials who complained about boozing in the PRU.

According to Mr Fabricant, one PRU aide was called a ‘whip’s nark’ by Mr Corby, in the hearing of a senior Minister. This newspaper has established that the Minister was Philip Dunne, then a whip and now a Defence Minister. 

Mr Fabricant volunteered a statement to The Mail on Sunday to rebut claims that he was in a ‘feud’ with Mr Corby.

He said: ‘There is no feud. In 2011, I met with two members of PRU staff, both of whom felt that activities in the PRU at the time fell far below the standards expected of a professional employer.

'One of them made the case that he is neither gay nor willing to involve himself in a culture of long drinking sessions.

‘He believed he was not being treated fairly despite his annual reviews saying his work was outstanding. Others had received modest pay rises while he had not.

'He had even been told in front of a Minister that he was a “whip’s nark” or whistleblower. As a consequence he left for a better job. I reported this to the appropriate authorities and that was that.’

Senior Tory sources have told this newspaper that Mr Corby was also the subject of a complaint concerning an allegation that he had returned to work after a boozy lunch, when a PRU aide was discussing a crucial Commons vote on the EU with a senior Foreign Office mandarin.

Furious: Strategist Lynton Crosby (pictured) was furious when Mr Fabricant said he was having an affair with a llama but refused to reveal its gender

Mr Corby allegedly grabbed the phone and made scrawled notes.

The incident was witnessed by Mr Dunne who was said to be furious. In a Tory inquiry into Mr Corby’s conduct, he defended himself saying he was not officially on duty that day and was trying to be helpful.

As evidence of his condition, the inquiry was given a sheet of Mr Corby’s scrawled notes made when he spoke to the FO mandarin.

The Mail on Sunday has copy of his notes. Mr Corby was told to improve his behaviour. PRU sources say  his behaviour subsequently improved markedly.

The intervention by Mr Fabricant adds to the increasingly bizarre nature of certain aspects of the so called ‘sexminster’ row to hit the  Tories at Westminster.

It has been likened to Tory peer Michael Dobbs’ House Of Cards TV political thriller set in Parliament – and by a quirk of fate, Mr Fabricant was ‘political adviser’ to the film.

Mr Fabricant was fired last week as deputy Tory chairman, reportedly for a series of hostile messages about expenses scandal MP Maria Miller, culminating in one saying ‘about time’ when she resigned as Culture Secretary.

David Cameron’s Australian-born strategist Lynton Crosby was furious when Mr Fabricant, in response to someone who asked him about his sexuality, said he was having an affair with a llama but refused to reveal its gender.

Mr Crosby is said to have protested: ‘We cannot have a f****** deputy chairman who believes in bestiality.’

Some Tories believe Mr Fabricant’s complaints about the PRU were also a factor in his dismissal by Conservative chairman Grant Shapps.
