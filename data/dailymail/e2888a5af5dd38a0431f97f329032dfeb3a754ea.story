'Ghoulish': Gareth Kemp lived with the body of a dead pensioner for weeks so he could continue to steal from him

A thief who lived with the body of a pensioner on his sofa for three weeks so he could continue to steal his life savings has been jailed.

Gareth Kemp, 40, had befriended Thomas Hulme, 72, who allowed him to live in his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, despite his drug addiction.

Mr Hulme also allowed Kemp to use his cash card so he could buy him shopping, Bolton Crown Court heard.

But when Kemp found Mr Hulme dead on his living room couch, he chose not to tell the authorities and continued to use the card to feed his drug habit for weeks.

Kemp was finally caught out when he appeared in court in connection with a separate offence and tried to throw a cash card to his girlfriend sitting in the public gallery.

Suspicious court staff intervened and discovered it belonged to Mr Hulme. They reported the matter to police.

Detectives discovered that over four weeks Kemp had drained almost all of Mr Hulme's life savings totalling more than £4,500.

Kemp admitted theft by false representation and was jailed for 20 months.

Mr Hulme's death was finally reported on April 18. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances but that he had likely been dead for around three weeks.

Caught out: Kemp was caught on CCTV near to cash machines when the withdrawals were made from Mr Hulme's account

Confession: When interviewed, Kemp admitted to police that he had withdrawn all the money to buy drugs

And during the investigation, police established that Kemp had continued to live in Mr Hulme's house during this time.

Bank records showed that Mr Hulme's bank balance had gone from £4,440.91 on March 11 to £4.78 overdrawn on April 15.

There were numerous withdrawals of £100 at various locations and the pattern of spending was vastly in excess of previous months. Officers also viewed CCTV of Kemp near to cash machines at the time withdrawals were made.

On interview Kemp admitted withdrawing all the money from the account to pay for drugs.

Detective Constable Andy Devine, said:
'Draining an elderly man’s life savings after he has died is, in my 
eyes, tantamount to grave robbing.

'The victim put a roof over Kemp’s head and got nothing in return other than betrayal.

'Over
just a few weeks Kemp blew a significant amount of money to feed a 
habit and his ghoulish actions reflect the kind of appalling lengths 
some people will go to when dependent on drugs.

'Drug addiction blights many lives and, as this case shows, can impact on the lives of the most innocent of residents.

'Hopefully a stint in prison will help cure him of this terrible affliction and help him to see the error of his ways.'
