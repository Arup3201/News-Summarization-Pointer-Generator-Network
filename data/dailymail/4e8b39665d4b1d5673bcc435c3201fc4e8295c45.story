Bedbugs have become a growing problem around the world, with epidemics New york and other world cities.

However, researchers have found an unlikely solution - kidney bean leaves.

Inspired by a traditional Balkan bedbug remedy, researchers found microscopic hairs on kidney bean leaves effectively stab and trap the biting insects.

The Bedbug (Cimex lectularius) may have finally met its match - in the unlikely form of a kidney bean leaf

Bedbugs have made a dramatic comeback
 in recent years, infesting everything from homes and hotels to schools,
 movie theaters and hospitals.

Although not known to transmit disease, their bites can cause burning, itching, swelling and psychological distress.

It helps to catch infestations early,
 but the nocturnal parasites’ ability to hide almost anywhere, breed 
rapidly and “hitchhike” from place to place makes detection difficult.

They can survive as long as a year without a blood meal.

Current
 commercial prevention methods, including freezing, extreme heating, 
vacuuming and pesticides, can be costly and unreliable.

Scientists at UC Irvine and the University of Kentucky are now developing materials that mimic the geometry of the leaves, according to findings published today in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Their work was motivated by a centuries-old remedy for bedbugs used in Bulgaria, Serbia and other southeast European countries.

Kidney bean leaves were strewn on the floor next to beds and seemed to ensnare the blood-seeking parasites on their nightly forays.

The bug-encrusted greenery was burned the next morning to exterminate the insects.

Through painstaking detective work, the scientists discovered that the creatures are trapped within seconds of stepping on a leaf, their legs impaled by microscopic hooked hairs known botanically as trichomes.

Using the bean leaves as templates, the researchers have microfabricated materials that closely resemble them geometrically.

The synthetic surfaces snag the bedbugs temporarily but do not yet stop them as effectively as real leaves, Loudon said, suggesting that crucial mechanics of the trichomes still need to be determined.Theoretically, bean leaves could be used for pest control, but they dry out and don’t last very long. They also can’t easily be applied to locations other than a floor. Synthetic materials could provide a nontoxic alternative.

'Plants exhibit extraordinary abilities to entrap insects,' said Catherine Loudon, lead author of the paper.

'Modern scientific techniques let us fabricate materials at a microscopic level, with the potential to ‘not let the bedbugs bite’ without pesticides.'“Nature is a hard act to follow, but the benefits could be enormous,” said Michael 
Potter of the University of Kentucky.

'Imagine if every bedbug inadvertently brought into a dwelling was captured before it had a chance to bite and multiply.'Funding for the study was provided by the National Science Foundation.

Common adult Bedbug- Bed bug (Cimex lectularius.)

Bedbugs, or cimicidae, are small parasitic insects that feed on human blood.

Reddish-brown, flattened, oval shaped and wingless, adult bed bugs grow to 4–5mm in length and 1.5–3mm wide.

To feed, the pests pierce the skin of their hosts with two hollow feeding tubes shaped like tongues.

With one tube it injects its saliva, which contains anticoagulants and anaesthetics, while with the other it sucks the blood of its host.

It takes between five to ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged, after which it usually returns to its hiding place.

Bedbugs can cause a number of health effects including skin rashes and allergic symptoms. Worryingly, they have been found with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA.

The creatures were largely eradicated in the developed world in the early Forties, but since 1995 they have enjoyed an unwelcome resurgence, the reasons for which are unclear.

Elusive and usually nocturnal, bedbugs can be hard to spot.

Aside from bite symptoms, signs include faecal spots, blood smears on sheets, and molts.

They can be found singly, but often congregate once established.
