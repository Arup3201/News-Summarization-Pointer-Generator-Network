David Cameron will today send a ‘love letter’ to Scotland as he makes a passionate plea for families across the UK to save the ‘most extraordinary country in the world’.

In a major speech at the symbolic Olympic Park in London, the Prime Minister will argue that 63million people across the UK all have a ‘voice’ in this year’s historic referendum.

He will urge families in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to urge friends and relatives in Scotland to vote against independence, to ensure that the message till ‘ring out’ that ‘we want you to stay’.

Mr Cameron will claim that victory for Alex Salmond would ‘rip the rug from under our own 
reputation’.

With some opinion polls suggesting that support for the break-up of Britain has increased marginally in recent weeks, Mr Cameron will also candidly admit: ‘The outcome is still up in the air.’

His speech, which comes on the same day as the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, is part of a concerted ‘lovebombing’ campaign being orchestrated from Downing Street.

It echoes a Canadian tactic that helped persuade voters in Quebec to reject separation in 1995, where the ‘Yes’ movement narrowly lost a referendum after being ahead in the polls. A campaign was arranged in the rest of the country at the time to demonstrate support for a ‘United Canada’, which is widely credited with the dramatic turn-around.

Mr Cameron will speak at the Olympic Park in east London, where athletes such as Jessica Ennis, Sir Chris Hoy and Mo Farrah famously contributed towards Team GB’s impressive tally of 65 medals in 2012.

Scottish athletes were involved in 18 per cent of those medals, but only three were won without the assistance of competitors from elsewhere in the UK.

Similarly, there are 18 Scots representing Team GB in this month’s Winter Olympics, while figure skaters from Northern Ireland and England have trained in Scotland.

But if the SNP wins September’s referendum, a separate Scottish team would compete for the first time at the next summer Olympics in Rio.

In 2012, Alex Salmond was widely ridiculed when he coined the term ‘Scolympians’ and failed to recognise the widespread support for Team GB north of the Border.

Last night, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon overlooked the SNP’s past record and accused the Prime Minister of ‘politicising’ the Olympics.

In his speech, Mr Cameron will say today: ‘For me, the best thing about the Olympics wasn’t the winning - it was the red, the white, the blue.

‘It was the summer that patriotism came out of the shadows and into the sun, everyone cheering as one for Team GB. And it’s Team GB I want to talk about today: Our United Kingdom.’

He will add: ‘This is a decision that is squarely and solely for those in Scotland to make.

‘But my argument today is that though only 4million people can vote in this referendum, all 63million of us are profoundly affected. There are 63million of us who could wake up [the day after the referendum] on September 19 in a different country, with a different future ahead of it.

‘That’s why this speech is addressed not to the people of Scotland, but to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We would be deeply diminished without Scotland.’

Mr Cameron will say the UK has a global reputation and is a ‘powerful brand’ around the world.

‘If we lost Scotland, if the UK changed, we would rip the rug from under our own reputation,’ he will add.

The Prime Minister will also warn against ‘complacency’ and encourage people across the UK to spend the next seven months doing ‘all we can to keep our United Kingdom as one’.

‘Seven months to save the most extraordinary country in history, and we must do whatever it takes,’ he will say.

‘So to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, everyone, like me, who cares about the United Kingdom, I want to say this: you don’t have a vote, but you do have a voice.’

Similar ‘love messages’ were sent to Scotland from the House of Commons yesterday, where Tory MP Rory Stewart said the argument against independence cannot solely be about economics.

‘If a relationship is going wrong, if a marriage is going wrong, the answer cannot simply be to say 'you can't afford to break up because you are going to lose the house',’ he said. The answer has to be only one thing which is 'I love you'.

‘And the nature of that love that we express for Scotland, we in this House are struggling to express. We are not very good as politicians in talking about emotions. We have become very bad at it.

‘But we need to learn to do it because otherwise a party which is trying to reduce, that is trying to shrink, that is trying to vanish, will win.’

Speaking in advance of Mr Cameron’s speech, Deputy SNP leader Miss Sturgeon said: ‘This is a cowardly speech from a Prime Minister who uses the Olympic Park in London to give high-handed lectures against Scotland’s independence, but hasn’t the guts to come to Scotland or anywhere else to make his case in a head-to-head debate.

‘A ‘Yes’ vote will put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands, and will mean we will never again have to endure Tory governments, Prime Ministers and policies we didn’t vote for.’

She added: ‘With this tawdry bid to use the Olympic Games – past and present – as a political tool, David Cameron has exposed the utter hypocrisy and double standards at the heart of the ‘No’ campaign.’
