John F Kennedy kept the cold war out of the North Pole. 

That's at least what he told Michelle, an 8-year-old girl who wrote to the president about being worried over Santa Claus being threatened by nuclear bombs from the Soviet Union.

The JFK Library Foundation in Boston released a video Friday displaying the text of the letter that Kennedy signed and sent to Michelle in 1961.

Nuclear winter: John F Kennedy penned a letter to 8-year-old Michelle in 1961 assuring her that Santa was safe from nuclear testing

'Dear Michelle,' the letter reads, 'I was glad to get your letter about trying to stop the Russians from bombing the North Pole and risking the life of Santa Claus.' 

'I share your concern about the atmospheric testing of the Soviet Union, not only for the North Pole but for countries throughout the world; not only for Santa Claus but for people throughout the world.'

'However, you must not worry about Santa Claus. I talked with him yesterday and he is fine. He will be making his rounds again this Christmas.'

Atmospheric testing refers to above-ground nuclear tests that the Soviet Union, the United States and other countries conducted.

Atmospheric testing: Two days after the letter was postmarked to Michelle, Russia actually tested a 50-megaton bomb, nicknamed Tsar Bomba, over an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean

Two days after the letter was postmarked to Michelle, Russia tested the Tsar Bomba, at 50 megatons the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated.

The bomb exploded over Novaya Zemlya, a Russian archipelago located in the Arctic Ocean, just over a thousand miles from the North Pole.
