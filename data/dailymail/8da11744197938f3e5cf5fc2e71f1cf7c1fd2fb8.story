An Ivory Coast model who was brutally 
beaten in a taxi, slipped into a coma after being left untreated by hospital staff for more than 12 hours because no one was there to pay her $230 
medical fees, her family claim.

Awa Fadiga, 23, was attacked about 11pm in a cab taking her home to an upscale neighborhood in the capital, Yamoussoukro, on March 23.

Two witnesses say they saw the locally famous fashion model being thrown out of the cab under a bridge, apparently unconscious.

Firefighters rushed the young woman to the Central University Hospital where she was allegedly neglected before falling into a coma. She died two days later.

Fadiga's aunt, Sira Kone Fadiga who had raised her since she was five-years-old, said the family heard about the young woman's injuries about 1pm the next day.

She
 said the hospital refused to provide even basic care until someone came
 to pay for Fadiga's treatment, showing bills amounting to around $230 
for everything from medicine to sanitary gloves.

'We found her half-naked on the floor, in a coma. We had to use her grandmother's scarf to hide her breasts,' she said.

The
 hospital CT scan machine was down that day, so Fadiga's family also had
 to pay for transport to a private clinic, Sira Kone Fadiga said.

Fadiga's
 death was caused by severe head injuries including a skull fracture 
sustained during the assault, according to the family and medical 
reports.

Police are searching for the driver and have shown two portraits of the men who allegedly robbed and attacked Fadiga.

Attacks in 
private taxis are fairly common, usually involving the driver and an 
accomplice who waits at an agreed-upon location to rob an unsuspecting 
passenger or is sometimes even hiding in the trunk.

Fadiga's tragic death has devastated her family, who said her modeling 
career was starting to take off.

She had signed with an elite agency and
 landed several major gigs, including an advertisement campaign with the
 telecoms firm Orange.

'Since she was a young teenager, people would stop her in the street to offer her modeling jobs,' her aunt said.

Health
 Ministry officials declined to comment for this story, but they have 
published several documents about Fadiga's case including a medical 
report.

A statement said the ministry was not responsible for Fadiga's death.

The horrific case of alleged neglect has reportedly shone a spotlight on Ivory Coast's declining health care system, once the envy of West Africa.

More than 8,000 Ivorians signed an 
online petition criticizing the hospital's behavior in Fadiga's case, 
and more than 23,800 have joined a Facebook group denouncing 'the priority of money over basic health care'.

'Everybody has a story like that. Awa is
 just the symbol of all our pain,' said Salif Barry, a 23-year-old 
technology worker.

'It is a moment to come together and ask ourselves 
what has become of our health care system.'

The
 hospital has denied claims of negligence, saying officials were 
following standard procedure, but the director of the hospital was fired
 on Friday.

The hospital, in a large concrete 
building erected in the 1960s at Ivory Coast's largest university in 
Abidjan's Cocody district, is a symbol of what Ivorians describe as 
free-falling care standards. It used to be considered the most modern 
hospital in West Africa.

Once one of Africa's most prosperous and stable countries, Ivory Coast has experienced economic decline and turbulent politics.

The
 country of 20 million people came near to a civil war in early 2011 
when Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down from power after losing 
elections. This sparked a violent crisis in which more than 3,000 people
 were killed before President Alassane Ouattara took office.

Free
 health care was stopped the 1990s because of the country's struggling 
economy and pressure from global financial institutions.

The
 free care was temporarily reinstated after the postelection violence in
 2011, but it proved too expensive and was again abandoned. Ouattara's 
government has said it intends to re-introduce universal health coverage
 by 2015.

Angry: Thousands of people have signed an online petition criticizing Central University Hospital which allegedly failed to immediately treat Fadiga last month (women pictured at Fadiga's funeral on April 2)

Disbelief: Mourners wearing T-shirts printed with Awa Fadiga's face openly wept at the 23-year-old model's funeral in the Ivory Coast on April 2

The
 state of the Cocody hospital illustrates the decline in Ivory Coast's 
health services. The hospital has leaking water pipes and there aren't 
enough beds for patients. Equipment is missing or broken, and doctors 
say they lack even the most basic resources.

'We
 have to buy our own soap to wash our hands,' said one doctor who spoke 
on condition of anonymity because he feared losing his job.

'We
 do want to help patients, but we do not have the means to do more. It's
 sad. When I started working at this hospital as an intern, it gave me 
pride. Now I realize how, slowly, this hospital is crumbling down.'
