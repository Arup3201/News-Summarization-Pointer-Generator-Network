Discovery: Painkillers found in Tesco's chocolate and nut cones, pictured, could have been put there on purpose, police believe

Supermarket ice creams found to contain painkillers may have been deliberately spiked, police say.

Tesco was forced to recall boxes of its own-brand chocolate and nut cones last month after two were found to have been contaminated. Now detectives believe the incident was sabotage.

Tablets were found in two separate cones in stores in different parts of the country and police are investigating the R&R Ice Cream factory near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, that supplies Tesco.

Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn from the North Yorkshire Police' major crime unit said: 'What we are trying to identify is how that product became 
contaminated.

'It
 is a challenging investigation, because what we have got to try and 
identify was how and where and who was responsible for that 
contamination, and was it deliberate contamination.

'With
 the process chain of all the ingredients that go into making an item 
like that, we don’t know for sure where that contamination took place.'

Mr Malyn added that the 
possibility of malicious contamination was 'one of the lines of inquiry'
 and his 'gut instinct' is that it was a 'deliberate contamination'.

He
 added: 'If it was felt to be accidental from the outset, the resources 
we have put into it probably wouldn’t be to the scale we have done.

'We have got to look at it as "we think it’s suspicious unless we prove otherwise".'

Tesco recalled its own-brand cones in November after two separate packets delivered
 to two different stores were found to contain the drugs.

One tablet was found in a single cone in each packet.

At the time the Food Standards Agency warned consumers not to eat the product and to return it to Tesco for a full refund.

A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'As a precautionary measure, we issued a product recall on Tesco Chocolate and Nut Ice Cream Cones in November, after two individual cones were found to contain tablets.

'We are currently investigating this incident with our supplier and we are helping the police with their enquiries.'

R&R - which also produces 
leading brands including Fab lollies, Rowntree’s Fruit Pastille lollies,
 Kelly’s of Cornwall ice cream and Skinny Cow - said today they are keen
 to hear the results of the investigation.

Human resources director for the R&R Peter 
Pickthall added police were 'now in the process of going through an 
investigation, that is taking some time'.

He
 added: 'They have taken away 
details to have a look at and will let us know in due course what, if 
anything, they want to do further.

'It is really a case of it being pending while they carry out their own investigation.'

Mr
 Pickthall added 'It is not something that would have been done in 
store, because it is two separate parts of the country so that has 
focused the police on the fact that it could be a potentially malicious 
act, perhaps by someone in the factory.

'From
 our point of view, if there is evidence of anything where there is 
potential for a consumer to be injured in any way we need to find out 
how it happened.

'If it
 is something like a tablet, which cannot have been accidentally put 
into the product, it needs to be investigated to try and find the 
culprit.'

R&R describes itself as one of the 
largest manufacturers and distributors of ice-cream in Europe.
