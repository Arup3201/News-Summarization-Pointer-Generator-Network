A groom-to-be who smacked the bottom of an air hostess on his way home from his stag do could be jailed - just two months before his wedding.

Peter Thompson, 48, was on a flight from Alicante, Spain to Bournemouth in Dorset when he drunkenly attacked the female Ryanair crew member.

He told the 'pretty' hostess he 'loved her' before he mounted a friend's lap and slapped her bottom as she walked past, the court heard.

The attendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pushed Thompson's hand away and told him not to do it again.

Case: Thompson appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates Court (pictured) where he pleaded guilty to being drunk on the flight and to one charge of assault

Thompson appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to being drunk on the flight and to one charge of assault.

Lee Turner, prosecuting, read a statement from the air stewardess and said Thompson told her she was very pretty and that he loved her.

The statement said: 'He was looking at me as if I was a piece of meat.'

She later noticed he moved from the seat and was sitting on the lap of his friend.

Mr Turner said: 'As she walked past he smacked her bottom with his open right hand.

'She pushed his hand away and said "Don't do that again".

'He wasn't aggressive, she thinks he was trying to be funny but was actually very disrespectful.'

The court heard that Thompson, who works at a language school and lives in Poole, had consumed alcohol and an antihistamine tablet before the flight on May 4.

He was then sold a discounted alcoholic drink by the air stewardess on the plane.

James Moore, defending, said that Thompson was in high spirits and looking forward to seeing his fiancee when the incident happened.

He said he flailed his arms to express himself and accidentally made contact with the stewardess as she walked past.

Mr Moore said: 'He's sat on the arm of a chair with a friend. He's barely aware that he's even touched her.

'Unfortunately, she got this wrong.

'What we have here is a man not intentionally making contact with the flight attendant. It wasn't nasty, it wasn't malicious, it didn't cause any trouble.

'This is not a sinister, nasty offence, it didn't put anyone at risk.'

Thompson will be sentenced on June 16, two months before he is due to get married.
