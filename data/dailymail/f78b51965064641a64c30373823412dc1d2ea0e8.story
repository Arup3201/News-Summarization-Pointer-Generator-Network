In demand: Millions of fans were left disappointed after tickets to see Beyonce, pictured, sold out in less than 15 minutes

If you’ve managed to get a ticket to one of Beyonce’s UK concerts, one question: how on earth did you do it?

Millions of fans have been left disappointed after seats to the 11 shows sold out in less than 15 minutes.

The tickets went on sale online and through phonelines at 9.30am on Saturday.

But following a rush of pre-sales to 02 mobile phone customers just 48 hours earlier, there were barely any to choose from. Those left had all gone by 9.42am.

One retailer selling tickets claimed three million people had flooded its website in two hours.

There are fears that a huge number of tickets priced between £55-£85 have been snapped up by touts who are now reselling them for more than £1,000 each.

Within moments of Saturday’s sell-out, tickets started appearing on eBay and ticketing websites.

One was on offer for up to £1,306.31 on Viagogo and another at £1,098 on Seatwave.

Fans who queued up at some venues didn’t fare much better.

Some of those who had camped over night for tickets to see the singer were left terrified and ticketless after gangs of thugs hijacked the queue.

Teenage girls were left in tears and one man has described how he was caught in a 'terrifying crush' as hundreds attempted to buy tickets.

Venue bosses turned everyone away empty-handed from the box office of Manchester Arena, after police were called when trouble erupted.

Some of the fans had waited outside 
in the cold conditions for up to 24 hours for the chance to see the 
American singer when she performs three gigs in the city later this 
year.

Tickets for the 
performances in May were due to go on sale at 9.30am on Saturday - but 
an announcement was made about ten minutes before that the box office 
would not be opening for health and safety reasons.

Security guards told the crowds they feared people would rush towards the ticket desks and cause a crush.

Genuine fans who had waited for hours slammed the organisation of the event as diabolical - and claimed the problems were caused by ticket touts.

Witnesses described how young girls were left in tears as groups of men barged into the queue, intimidating them and throwing bottles. One teenage girl said it was the scariest night of her life.

They were verbally abusive, trying to bribe people to buy extra tickets for them, and some were even openly taking drugs, according to fans.

Sarah Miah, 25, from Bury, queued for 17 hours and said that the problems began about 10.30pm when the touts pushed into the queue - with stampedes throughout the night as they fought to get near the box office.

Sarah said: 'I stayed in the tunnel outside the arena to avoid being crushed when all hell broke loose at about 5am.

'Men were ripping open fire doors 
that were locked. Once opened, they fought to get through one side of a 
double door.

'Children were getting crushed and screaming. It was 
horrible. By far the worst night of my life.'

Emily
Hopkins, who was among the first in line for the tickets, also 
described the experience as one of the scariest of her life.

The 15-year-old, from Moston, queued up outside Manchester Arena for 26 hours with a group of friends.

But
she said their excitement about the prospect of seeing their idol was 
replaced by fear when ticket touts descended en masse and barged their 
way into the queue.

Emily
told how the men were smoking cannabis, swearing loudly and pushing 
genuine fans out of the way throughout the night, from about 10.30pm.

Fans were told not to travel to the arena's box office when the concerts were announced, the venue has said.

A spokesman for Manchester Arena said: 'Since the Beyonce dates were announced two weeks ago we strongly advised all customers not to travel to the venue box office as tickets could not be guaranteed due to the anticipated high demand.

'Unfortunately, when we opened our doors at 5.30am what had been an orderly queue immediately stormed the box office windows causing a potential crush.

'Despite the best efforts of our stewards and security staff we had to involve British Transport Police in an attempt to restore order. Even then the safety of genuine fans could not be guaranteed and, following police advice, the box office remained closed.

'This information was communicated via our PA system and customers were redirected to the official website and phone lines for tickets.'

She was so scared that she called her mother, Debbie, in distress at 1am. Her mother was so horrified when she turned up that she called the police twice.

Emily said: 'It was really horrible. It was intimidating and frightening - one of the scariest nights of my life.

'These men were smoking drugs, they were so aggressive and more and more turned up into the night. They were pushing in and drinking. We were all so excited about seeing Beyonce - we love her - but this was more like a nightmare.'

Debbie, 47, said around 300 people were queuing for tickets - and she estimated that lots looked like ticket touts. She is making a formal complaint to the Arena. She said: 'It was absolutely disgusting the way that it was handled.

'I ended up calling the police twice and it got really bad when the lads started ripping the doors open. They were trying to fight their way to the box office but nobody seemed to be doing anything about it.

'The situation was out of control and it’s so unfair that people like my daughter had to go through that - and end up ticketless.'

Dozens of fans also posted of their anger on Twitter. One wrote: '100s of Beyonce fans crushed and camped out. Turned away due to health and safety. Was no organisation. Appalling.'

The US singer - who thrilled millions with her spectacular performance at the Super Bowl earlier this month - is visiting Manchester on May 7, 8 and 9 as part of her world tour.

All general release tickets for her 11-date UK arena tour, starting in Birmingham on April 26, sold out within 12 minutes.

Ticketmaster crashed as fans bombarded the site in the hope of snapping up the seats.

But some tickets quickly appeared on the online auction site eBay for hundreds of pounds over their face value. The seats, which originally cost £60 to £90, were on offer for up to £1,000 a pair.

Beyonce, 31, will perform six shows at
the 20,000-seat O2 Arena in London.

There will also be two shows at the
15,000 seat LG Arena in Birmingham and three at the 21,000 seat 
Manchester Arena. Phone firm O2, which organised the ticket pre-sale, 
said it could have sold out London’s O2 Arena 150 times.

A Liverpool man today told how he was caught in a terrifying crush after Beyonce fans stormed the arena box office in a bid to get tickets.

Shaun Pyke (right), 25, of Netherton, had waited overnight at Manchester Arena to buy tickets so his family could see the Destiny's Child star perform in May.

But he was caught up in the melee after hundreds of fans rushed into a small corridor - and then turned away empty-handed after the box office was closed.

Shaun and about nine friends got to Manchester at 1pm on Friday ahead of the tickets going on sale at 9.30am on Saturday.

He was hoping to secure seats at the Mrs Carter Show Tour as presents for his mum Susan Stevens and sister Angela.

He said: 'At about 5.30am one of the security guards led us through the car park and into a corridor.

'As they opened the door people started running to get to the front of the corridor but the security guard wouldn't open the other door.

'I had a panic attack - if it wasn't for my friend I would have collapsed. It was traumatising, I couldn't breathe and I could just hear screaming. In the end the doors came off their hinges.'

Shaun was left with bruised ribs and a bruised knee after the crush and had to take yesterday off work to recover.

He said: 'We came home on the minibus in silence. None of us could believe what had happened.'
