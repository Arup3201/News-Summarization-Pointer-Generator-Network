An abandoned dog so skinny you could see his ribcage has been rehomed in time for Christmas after he was nursed back to health.

The Staffie-cross was found abandoned wandering the streets of Birmingham by the dog warden in the summer.

He was taken to Birmingham Dogs' Home weighing little more than 5kg, the weight of a healthy cat, and he was so thin horrified staff could easily count his ribs.

Starved: Staffie-cross Sammi was so this his ribs were clearly visible after he was left abandoned on the streets

Picture of health: But he now looks full of life after being nursed back to a normal weight by staff at Birmingham Dogs' Home

But after months of dedicated care, 12-month-old Sammi has been nursed back to health and delighted kennel workers have managed to find him a new home just in time for the festive season.

Sammi, who now weighs a healthy 12.5kg, has happily settled into his new home with owner Pauline Soloman.

Alayna Warner, who looked after Sammi at the home, said: 'Sammi was in a real state when he was brought to us - he was very nervous and so thin.

'We think someone had just abandoned him on the street after deciding they didn't want him.

'The poor thing was so think - it was heart-breaking. He was very nervous at first, but obviously a friendly dog, as it wasn't long before his cheeky personality started to shine through.

'He's now back up to full health and has settled in really well with his new owner.'

Abandoned: Sammi weighed the same as a cat when he was found wandering the streets of Birmingham

Visible: Nurses at the dogs' home were shocked at how they could see Sammi's ribs when he first arrived

Tranformation: Staff at the kennel have been delighted with Sammi's progress following months of care

New owner Pauline said: 'Sammi is a lovely dog and I'm so glad I've been able to offer him a loving home.

'He was so skinny when he was taken into the home, but fortunately, he's happy and healthy now.

New family member: Owner Pauline Soloman has said Sammi is a 'lovely dog' and is glad she had been able to rehome him

'He's made himself a little bed on the sofa, and he loves snuggling up there.'

The dogs' home has been inundated with abandoned dogs, leading manager Alayna to ask potential dog owners to think carefully before deciding to share their home with a dog.

She said: 'Our kennels are fit to bursting all year round, but especially at this time of year, I'd ask people to really think before deciding to take on a dog.

'A lot of people don't research the cost involved, and just throw their pet out on the streets when they get bored with it.

'There has been a notable decrease in the number of people coming to us to collect their dogs.

'It used to be the case that about half of our dogs had gone missing, and people phoned around looking for them before coming to collect them from us - but in the last 12 months, fewer and fewer owners are coming to us to be reunited with their pets.

'People even bring dogs into us with the most ludicrous reasons why they can't keep them - one woman told us she didn't expect the dog to bark, and several people have brought dogs to us saying they didn't realise their puppies would grow so big.

'It's great that Sammi has found a home, and we hope that all our dogs will be as lucky as him.'

Commitment: The kennel has said it is inundated with dogs and warned people to think carefully before sharing deciding to get a new pet
