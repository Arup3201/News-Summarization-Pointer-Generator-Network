So what do Arsenal have to worry about?

76,000 raging Turks is never a hospitable sight. It will be raucous, visceral and unpleasant. When Manchester United visited in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson said afterwards: 'The fans made the loudest noise I have ever heard.' Arsenal will have to show that they are made of the right stuff and silence the Ataturk Stadium.

Anything to concern Arsenal on the pitch?

Pre-season can often be a deception - just ask Manchester United - but Besiktas did beat Chelsea 1-0 in Istanbul just a few weeks ago. It was, however, only a 45-minute game. The Turks also lost 2-1 against Wigan Athletic in a friendly game this summer.

Who do Arsenal need to watch out for?

Demba Ba is the main man, having moved to Besiktas this summer after scoring 50 goals in English football over the course of three seasons at West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea. Another former Premier League player - Kerim Frei - who spent a couple of seasons at Fulham, is highly-rated by Arsenal's Turkish opposition.

And who's the leader on the sidelines?

Slaven Bilic, the former West Ham defender that rather enjoys knocking English teams out of competitions. He was the man in charge of Croatia when they defeated Steve McClaren's England home and away to deny the Three Lions' progress into Euro 2008.

Reason to be cheerful?

Arsenal have a potent record against Turkish opposition. Over 90 minutes, they have played seven games, winning four of those and drawing three. Arsenal also defeated Turkish side Fenerbahce to qualify for the Champions League group stages last season.

Reason to be fearful?

Arsenal fans still rue that UEFA Cup final in Copenhagen in 2000, when the Gunners were defeated by Galatasaray in a penalty shootout. Davor Suker and Patrick Vieira both missed from the spot to hand the victory to the Turkish side. In clashes before the game, four men were stabbed.
