A schoolboy has been threatened with expulsion after getting a hair cut inspired by The Only Way Is Essex.

Daniel Smith, 14, had his hair styled like TOWIE star Mario Falcone, 24, for the last week of term at Strood Academy in Kent.

But teachers branded the cut - which involves shaven sides and long hair on top - 'extreme' and said it would affect his 'educational outcomes'.

Richard Hart, principal of Strood Academy, said there is 'a clear link' between a smart dress code and better results

Now Daniel has been told if his hair style has not changed by the time he goes back to school in January, he could be expelled.

His mother Clare Whalin, 41, said Daniel's hair cut is 'not offensive in any way'.

The mother-of-three, who works with adults with learning difficulties, said: 'He was told that if he doesn't grow it back in January he can expect to be excluded.

Strood Academy in Kent branded Daniel Smith's shaved sides and long on top haircut 'extreme'. His mother Clare Whalin says it is 'not offensive in any way' and that her son is being discriminated against

'He is known for always looking immaculate. There's a boy in sixth form who's got a Mario, but they are saying that's OK because he's older. That's just discrimination.

'Daniel is doing well at school, and I don't see why he should be penalised for looking smart.

'It's certainly not offensive in any way. Anyone would think he had dyed his hair purple.'

Richard Hart, principal of Strood Academy, said there is a 'clear link' between smart dress and good results at the school.

He
said: 'We believe there is a clear link between standards of dress, 
behaviour and educational outcomes for young people and this is 
reflected in our policies and procedures that were agreed with the 
Department of Education when we opened in 2009.

'Our rules state that extreme haircuts or style are not allowed, examples are patterns or unnatural colours.

'In
cases where these rules are contravened we ask young people and parents
to remedy the situation, as far as is possible and not to infringe the 
rule in the future.'

Mario Falcone works as a tailor and joined TOWIE in series three.
