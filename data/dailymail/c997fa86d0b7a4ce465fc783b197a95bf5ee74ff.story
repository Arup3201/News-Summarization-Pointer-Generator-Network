Programmes such as Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax have reversed a ‘long term decline’ in the relationship between the BBC and the North, says the corporation’s Director of England.

But it is perhaps unsurprising Peter Salmon should make these comments, given that his wife Sarah Lancashire is the star of both shows.

Salmon, who is in charge of the BBC’s Salford base, has revealed figures showing that ‘for the first time in living memory’ people in the North feel better represented than those in the rest of the UK.

Peter Salmon, who is in charge of the BBC's Salford base, pictured, claimed the corporation has reconnected with the north of England following the success of Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax

In 2011, before 3,000 BBC staff began working in MediaCity UK, in Salford, the corporation gave itself an internal score for the portrayal of people in the north of England of 6.30, compared with 6.48 for the rest of the UK.

But numbers released today show the balance has shifted to 6.31 for the north of England and 6.29 for the rest of the UK. The highest score was given to northwest viewers with 6.48.

Speaking at a Broadcast Press Guild event in London, Salmon, who earns a salary of £375,000 said: ‘When we did the big change and the big switch, we said this has got to transform the experience of licence fee payers right across the region.

‘So in the last two or three years we’ve halved the gap in consumption between the North and the rest of the UK. It used to be 4 percent because the BBC has been traditionally more southern centric broadcaster in terms of consumption. ITV were the kings and queens outside London but in recent years we’ve reversed that.

‘If we look at things like portrayal approval and things like that, do the people think the BBC reflects their lives, we now see for the first time in living memory people in the north of England feeling on a par to the rest of the UK, if not slightly better represented’.

He put this down to the increase in programmes both set and produced in the region, such as drama Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax, both set in Yorkshire, and Inspector George Gently, set in Northumberland and County Durham.

A number of formerly London-based departments, such as sport and children’s programming, moved to Salford three years ago and tent-pole shows such as Blue Peter and Match of the Day are also now produced there.

He said that shows such as Last Tango in Halifax, pictured,  helped reverse the BBC's decline in the north

Salmon believes this has thawed even the frostiest of the BBC’s regional relationships. 

He said: ‘In the North East of England, which has always been one of the most chilly places for the BBC, it’s quite remote from London based organisations typically, we’ve really begun to reverse years of having a negative relationship either with the power structure in the North East or audiences. We’ve done it simply by making a lot more programmes in the Northeast.’

Happy Valley is a crime drama following the Yorkshire police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire, trying to come to terms with the suicide of her daughter. She becomes obsessed with the man who she believes raped her daughter and drove her to suicide. It transpires that the man is also involved in a kidnapping plot.

Earlier this year Happy Valley prompted criticism for showing ‘gratuitous’ violence in a string of graphic scenes.

The lead character - police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire - was savagely beaten in a basement during one episode.

As the show ended, she collapsed in the road, her face covered in blood, leaving viewers guessing whether she had died.

The scenes prompted 15 complaints from viewers.

It followed a harrowing incident previously in which another policewoman was murdered on a lonely country road.

An average of 5.8million viewers tuned in to Happy Valley’s first four instalments, and most praise its gripping plot and realistic police procedure.

But some have expressed concern at its increasingly gruesome twists and graphic depictions of violence against women.

Last Tango in Halifax is a romantic comedy series also starring Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid.

Alan Buttershaw (Jacobi) and Celia Dawson (Reid) are both widowed and in their 70s. When their grandsons put them on Facebook, they rediscover their feelings for one another are as intense as they were 60 years ago when they were teenagers.

Sarah Lancashire plays Anne Reid’s daughter Caroline in the series.

Mr Salmon’s relationship with his common law wife collapsed in 2000 and it emerged that he and Miss Lancashire were an item several months later. Mr Salmon the former controller of BBC1, left the mother of his three sons, Penny Watt, after falling for the former Coronation Street star.

Mr Salmon and Miss Lancashire got to know each other when he worked at Granada Television in Manchester. They have a son together and live in Twickenham, south-west London.
