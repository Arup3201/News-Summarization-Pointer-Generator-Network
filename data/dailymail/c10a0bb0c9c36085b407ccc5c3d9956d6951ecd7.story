Physicists may have created the smallest drops of liquid ever made in the lab.

Researchers using the Large Hadron Collider in Cern say they create droplets three to five protons in size - 100,000th the size of a hydrogen atom or one-100,000,000th the size of a virus.

The droplets are believed to be similar to a primordial matter that existed immediately following the Big Bang, the team say.

This surprise result was achieved by firing proton 'bullets' into lead ions, creating a subatomic blood spatter-like effect.

Evidence of the minuscule droplets 
was extracted from the results of colliding protons with lead ions at 
velocities approaching the speed of light.

To provide a sense of scale, that is about one-100,000th the size of a hydrogen atom or one-100,000,000th the size of a virus.

'With
 this discovery, we seem to be seeing the very origin of collective 
behavior,' said Julia Velkovska, professor of physics at Vanderbilt who led the study.

'Regardless
 of the material that we are using, collisions have to be violent enough
 to produce about 50 sub-atomic particles before we begin to see 
collective, flow-like behavior.'

These tiny droplets 'flow' in a manner 
similar to the behavior of the quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter 
that is a mixture of the sub-atomic particles that makes up protons and 
neutrons and only exists at extreme temperatures and densities - and many believe the entire universe once consisted of this 
strongly interacting elixir for fractions of a second after the Big Bang
 when conditions were dramatically hotter and denser than they are 
today.

Now that the universe has spent billions of years expanding and 
cooling, the only way scientists can reproduce this primordial plasma is
 to bang atomic nuclei together with tremendous energy.

In what was supposed to be a control run
 to check the validity of their lead-lead results, the scientists 
scheduled the collider to smash protons and lead nuclei together. They 
didn’t expect to see any evidence of the plasma.

Because the protons are
 so much lighter than lead nuclei (they have only one-208th the mass), 
it was generally agreed that proton-lead collisions couldn’t release 
enough energy to produce the rare state of matter.

'The proton-lead collisions are 
something like shooting a bullet through an apple while lead-lead 
collisions are more like smashing two apples together: A lot more energy
 is released in the latter,' said Velkovska.

After analyzing several billion events, they found hundreds of cases where the collisions produced more than 300 particles flowing together.
