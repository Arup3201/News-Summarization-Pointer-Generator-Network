Jenson Button is feeling 'really comfortable' over his future no matter which way the dice may fall at McLaren.

A decision from the team as to whether Button or Kevin Magnussen will partner the returning Fernando Alonso next year is likely to be announced on Friday.

It follows a board meeting on Thursday involving Group CEO Ron Dennis and two other primary shareholders in TAG co-owner Mansour Ojjeh and Mahmood Hashim Al Kooheji, CEO of Mumtalakat, Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund.

Button and Magnussen are vying to partner former Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso at McLaren in 2015 

Dennis has kept everyone waiting on tenterhooks for an announcement as he has opted to evaluate every aspect of his two drivers and take on board opinions, even though the final decision is his alone.

It is understood Magnussen will get the nod, with Button switching to sportscars and a crack at the World Endurance Championship where good friends and two other former Formula One drivers in Mark Webber and Anthony Davidson currently ply their trade.

Davidson even became a world champion in his own right last month when he and Toyota team-mate Sebastien Buemi, another ex-F1 driver, claimed the WEC crown.

Such a move would represent a good step for Button, even though he would love an additional year at McLaren working alongside Alonso.

The 34-year-old Englishman appeared in good spirits as he entertained the crowds in Scotland on Thursday

'It's a weird time,' said Button speaking at a Johnnie Walker 'responsible drinking' event in Edinburgh.

'It's the end of the season, we haven't got a race for many months, and I have had time to reflect on many things.

'The great thing is I've had my family and my mates round, so there have been a lot of people to talk to about it, to discuss.

'It's been an important week, but a really good week. I'm now really comfortable, and whatever happens I will have a great year next year.

'New challenges are exciting, whether it's in Formula One with McLaren alongside an exciting team-mate, or whether it's elsewhere.

'So I'm good, but I just want to get it done. I want to hear the decision - as we all do - so we can all move on in whatever direction.'

Button speaks to the assembled media about his future 

Button can understand McLaren pursuing a big name such as Alonso in light of Honda's arrival as power-unit supplier after a seven-year absence from F1, and their desire for a marquee name.

But he feels it a pity McLaren could not keep faith with himself and Magnussen given the rapport he has developed with the young Dane.

Button added: 'I've spent some time with Kevin over the past couple of days, and it's been really nice doing that.

'This situation has been difficult for both of us, but we've shown over the last couple of days that we work so well together.

'It's such a shame we won't be working together in the future in terms of being team-mates.

'But we're both very grown up about the situation and we'll both deal with it whichever way it goes.'

Button does have irons in the fire, and whilst nothing is signed as he awaits Dennis' decision, he is looking forward to the future.

'There are options, but nothing set in stone yet,' added Button. 'What I can say is I'll definitely be racing next year, and in a series I'll be very excited to race in, so there's no worry of me not racing next year.

'If it's a new challenge it will be exciting, if it's in Formula One it will be very exciting as well because that will be a new challenge with Honda.'
