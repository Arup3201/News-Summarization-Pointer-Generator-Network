This is the moment a couple spotted a mysterious flying object hovering in the night sky above their home.

Footage of the strange glowing light was captured with a mobile phone from the back garden of a home in Eltham, south London.

Stunned couple Charlie and Gemma were having a cigarette outside at about 9pm on Monday when they noticed the unidentified object hanging motionless in the distance.

Mysterious: This strange light was seen hovering in the sky above Eltham in South London on Monday night

The couple captured the footage from this spot in their back garden and took daytime footage to show where it had been

Charlie grabbed his girlfriend's phone and managed to capture 30 seconds of footage of the bizarre light.

The round object stayed in the same place for a matter of minutes before disappearing, leaving the couple baffled.

In the video, Charlie, 27, can be heard saying: 'Oh what the hell man. What is that?'

His girlfriend Gemma, 24, then suggests it might be a plane before Charlie replies: 'That's staying in the same place though Gemma.' 

Gemma can be heard banging on the window to encourage her brother and his girlfriend - who live in the same house - to come and take a look. But they were too late and after a few minutes it had vanished.

This morning, Charlie told MailOnline that he was adamant he had not seen a passing plane and that it could not have been the moon as it was too small, or a lamp post as there are none in that position.

Unexplained: The couple are adamant that the light could not have been the moon or a passing plane

‘It was really weird because I’m a massive sceptic when it comes to things like this,' he said.

'But it couldn’t have been a plane as they do not normally appear as a light like that – normally they would be flashing.

‘I’m 100 per cent certain it was not the moon. It was too small for that. It is a quiet road and there is no street light where I was filming.

‘If anything it looked like a massive star.

‘Eventually it just disappeared.

‘The whole thing is really mysterious and we are still scratching our heads trying to work out what it was.’
