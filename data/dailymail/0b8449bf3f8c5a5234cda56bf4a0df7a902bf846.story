A dead bear cub has been found in New York's Central Park Monday morning - and the New York Police Department is investigating it as a case of animal cruelty.

The cub was discovered under a bush by a Central Park Conservancy worker about 9.45am, who called 911.

The NYPD says it does not know where the bear came from or how it got to Central Park, though the department's animal cruelty unit has been called to investigate the case.

The bear, which is about three feet long, was discovered near West Avenue near West 69th Street, just south of Strawberry Fields. 

It appeared to have a cut on its side and suffered trauma before itself death, police said. 

Police are still trying to identify the species of bear, noting only that it had 'dark-colored fur.'

'We don't know where it came from or how it got there,' a police spokesman said.

Black bears are native to the hills and mountains in New Jersey and New York - though it seems unlikely that a bear could have made it to Central Park, which is surrounded on all sides by dense Manhattan neighborhoods. 

The Central Park Zoo had a famous depressed polar bear named Gus, who died in August 2013. 

Zoo officials are currently remodeling Gus' enclosure to make way for a new pair of bear pals - Betty and Veronica - who are moving from the Bronx Zoo.
