Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has been awarded a sixth Michelin star after his new London restaurant Dinner was upgraded to two stars.

The chef has kept his three-star rating for The Fat Duck and one star for The Hinds Head, neighbouring restaurants in Bray, Berkshire.

The 2014 Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland also awarded a second star to The Greenhouse, the Mayfair restaurant run by French chef Arnaud Bignon, for its ‘technically impressive and innovative cooking’.

Diner is Mr Blumenthal's newest restaurant located in London icon the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park and showcases historic British gastronomy.

Mr Blumenthal said: 'This is absolutely brilliant - I am overjoyed. It's great news for Ashley [Palmer-Watts, executive head chef for The Fat Duck Group] and the whole team.

'It's been an incredible two and a half years for Dinner and this is just simply the highlight. As a Brit, I am very proud that a restaurant inspired by and celebrating historic British cooking has been recognised today.'

Mr Palmer-Watts said: 'This is just incredible news and an amazing achievement for the entire team at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. Everyone works so hard every day and myself and Heston are so proud of each and every one of them. I am just blown away.'

The 15 new one stars include Wilks, an ‘unpretentious neighbourhood restaurant’ in Bristol, and Campagne, a contemporary Kilkenny restaurant.

Lima in London is the first Peruvian restaurant to gain a star, highlighting the increasing popularity of South American cuisine, the guide said.

Lima co-owner Gabriel Gonzalez said: ‘A Michelin star is an incredible accomplishment.

‘I am so proud of Robert Ortiz and the team at Lima who work to exceptional standards at every service, and feel this really is a testament to all of our hard work over the past year.

‘To be the first Peruvian restaurant to achieve a star in UK and Europe is a huge accolade.’

Rebecca Burr, the guide's editor, said: ‘We have never produced a GB and Ireland guide that provides our readers with such diversity and variety.

Continues to shine: The Fat Duck, another of Blumenthal's restaurants which serves unique dishes such as nitro green tea (right) and beautifully presented mango puree (left), retained its three Michelin stars

‘Fantastic B&Bs, wonderful pubs, stylish hotels, world class restaurants and great value eateries - we have them all in our guide.

‘In the last year, we've seen the rise of relaxed counter dining but also the opening of some big brasseries.

‘Dining is becoming a less structured, less formal affair and opening times and menus are more flexible to reflect the way we live our lives.

‘Single concept restaurants focusing on one or two dishes have also continued to open.

‘The Michelin guide has always reflected what's out there and London in particular has never offered so much choice.

‘There really is something for everyone and for every occasion and there appears to be no end to the number of exciting new restaurant openings.

‘With cuisines and culinary influences from all parts of the globe, it's no surprise that the capital is one of the most exciting cities in the world for food.

‘We've seen internationally acclaimed chefs open restaurants over here but we're also delighted to witness the rise of the next generation of talented British chefs and the continued evolution of British cooking.’

The Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland 2014 goes on sale on October 4 priced £15.99.

What the critics said:

‘Dinner updates historic dishes with flair and precision. The signature Tudor-inspired "meat fruit" bears striking resemblance to a dimpled mandarin, its gel-like zesty sheen yields to a delectable chicken liver and foie gras parfait, with chargrilled sourdough bread a perfect partner’ – TimeOut

‘Dinner by Heston Blumenthal may be expensive, but it's also bloody lovely. Save up’ – The Guardian

‘So what do you want to hear? That Dinner by Heston Blumenthal at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, despite its bombastic, unwieldy and quite horrendous name… officially the best restaurant in London? Well, then it is’ – The Times
