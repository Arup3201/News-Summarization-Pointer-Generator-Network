Here's something to raise French spirits after they were named Europe's gloomiest people - a water-splash recreation of their beloved Eiffel Tower.

According to polls this week the country appears to have lost its famous joie de vivre.

But maybe this droplet artwork can reinvigorate their sense of national pride.

This patriotic image of a water-splash recreation of the Eiffel Tower was created by French photographer Vincent Xeridat, 30, from Miramas, Provence

The patriotic image was created by French photographer Vincent Xeridat, 30, from Miramas, Provence, France.

He said: 'I wanted a picture of my beautiful flag in my gallery and what's more representative than the Eiffel Tower to illustrate France?'

To create his work, he first fills a square vase to the brim with coloured water.

A 'spring mushroom' effect is created with a drop of coloured water. The artist uses a pipette to carefully drop the water and create the beautiful images

The 'autumn mushroom' was again created using a pipette to release droplets and create tiny splashes. A macro lens, flashgun and reflex enclosure allow Mr Xeridat to capture the rebounds in detail at 1/2000 of a second

In this 'nuclear explosion' image, an eruption of water 'lava' is created against a fiery backdrop

He then uses a pipette to release droplets and create tiny splashes.

A macro lens, flashgun and reflex enclosure allow him to capture the rebounds in detail at 1/2000 of a second.

It takes Mr Xeridat up to three hours to capture an image he is happy with.

For the Eiffel Tower image he superimposed three different water droplet shots on top of each other using digital software.

This image (left) appears to show a hula hooping dancer with arms above her head, while the image on the right is Mr Xeridat's interpretation of a lassoing cowboy

An exploding light sabre is created against the backdrop of a sinister looking 'Darth Vader'

Some of his other images, which have tailored backgrounds, include water droplets shaped like cowboys, aliens and mushrooms.

And although he is happy with the final result of the Eiffel Tower image, he is not 100 per cent convinced it will cheer his nation up completely

He added: 'The French are well-known for griping - even when all goes well.'
