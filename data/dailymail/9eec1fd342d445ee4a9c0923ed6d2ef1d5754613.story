The son of Quincy star Jack Klugman is livid that his late father is not receiving a tribute at Sunday's Emmy Awards in Los Angeles.

And Adam Klugman feels it's an unfair and odd decision to pay tribute to tragic Glee star Cory Monteith while omitting his Emmy winning father, who died last December aged 90, and other TV icons who passed away this year, like Dallas legend Larry Hagman.

'I think it's criminal,' The Hollywood Reporter quoted Adam Klugman about his father's omission from the memorial tributes.

Fallen stars: The Emmy Awards will remember late Glee star Cory Monteith, shown in 2012, but The Odd Couple star and three time Emmy winner Jack Klugman, shown in 2008, did not make the five-person memorial list

His father - who took home three gongs
at the TV Oscars also starred in The Odd Couple, and was hugely beloved 
for his canon of work.

Tragedy: Adam Klugman doesn't mean to disparage the late Glee star

Adam said: 'My dad was at the inception of television and helped build it in the early days.'

He
added: 'It's an insult and it really seems typical of this 
youth-centric culture that has an extremely short attention span and 
panders to only a very narrow demographic of young adults."

The
Emmy Awards honouring the small screen's finest on Sunday will feature 
tributes to five television stars who died in the past year, including one for Cory Monteith of Glee, who overdosed in July.

Adam said: 'What about the people who should be introduced to somebody like my father?'

'I don't mean to say anything disparaging about Cory, but he was a kid who had won no Emmys and it was a self-induced tragedy.'

Cory's mother Ann defended her son's inclusion to TMZ, she said: 'If he had lived 30 more years he would have accomplished much more.'

The
show will also pay tribute to Sopranos star James Gandolfini, All In 
The Family matriarch Jean Stapleton, comedy legend Jonathan Winters and 
producer Gary David Goldberg who created Family Ties.

The awards show's tribute segment will not include iconic television actors such as I Dream of Jeannie and Dallas star Larry Hagman and Jack Klugman, star of The Odd Couple and Quincy, M.E.

Emmy Awards show executive producer Ken Ehrlich told the New York Daily News in an article on Wednesday that grumbling was to be expected.

'No matter what we do, there will be people who feel we had other options and could have done other things,' Ehrlich said.

Top of the game: Jack starred in The Odd Couple and Quincy, he passed away last December aged 90

Shock: Many are displeased that Larry Hagman isn't included, especially given his triumphant return in the rebooted Dallas

Made the list: Jean Stapleton, shown bottorm right in 1983 with the cast of All In The Family, will be among those remembered at the Emmy Awards

The decision to honour Monteith, who died in July at age 31 of an alcohol and heroin overdose, has drawn the most second-guessing.

'It was a rather personal choice. Corey’s appeal was to maybe a little different generation than some of the others we were honouring,' he said.

The ultimate decision rested with the show's producers and was a judgement call.

'In all candour, this became a producer’s option, and we selected these five individuals knowing that there were certainly others that could have been treated this way,' Ehrlich added.

Comedy legend: Jonathan Winters, shown in 2005 in Los Angeles, will be honoured by Robin Williams

Meanwhile, Emmy winning actor Peter MacNicol has defended the award show's choice in honouring Monteith

The
television veteran, who won his gong for his part in Ally McBeal, 
believes that the tribute could help dissuade youngsters from abusing 
drugs.

'If we are going to get into a merit system based on longevity then we are in trouble.' he told TMZ.

Adding: 'The memoriam is not only to honour those who completed a full marathon.'

But fellow Glee star Jane Lynch was a bit more fair and balanced in her estimation of the situation.

The actress told TMZ: 'Obviously I'm a big fan of Jack Klugman. I don't choose these things.

'He was there in the beginning of television and he had a terrific career. And if I were his son, maybe I'd be upset too.'

Adding
of her scheduled appearance on the Emmy's to honour Monteith: 'I'm 
really proud to be up there tonight and proud to tell people about him.'

Sympathetic: Fellow Glee star Jane Lynch says she can empathise with Adam Klugman, pictured in Los Angeles earlier this month

Close friends of the late actors will remember them during the tribute segment.

Edie Falco will talk about Gandolfini who played her mobster husband on The Sopranos and Jane Lynch will pay tribute to her Glee co-star Monteith.

Rob Reiner will honour Stapleton, who played his mother-in-law Edith Bunker on All In The Family, while Mork and Mindy star Robin Williams will pay homage to his mentor Winters.

Family Ties star Michael J. Fox will honour the show's creator Goldberg.

The 65th Primetime Emmy Awards will air on Sunday on CBS.
