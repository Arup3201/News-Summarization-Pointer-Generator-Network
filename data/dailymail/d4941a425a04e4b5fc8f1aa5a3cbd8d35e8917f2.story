What started as some complaints from neighbors has lead to a former NASCAR driver being locked up on several drug-related charges this week after allegedly being caught cooking meth.

Robert Powell, 49, had been under investigation for some time after residents near his home in Goose Creek, South Carolina, reported suspicious activity.

Powell competed in NASCAR’s Weekly Series from 1984 to 2002 winning 111 races in 328 starts at Summerville, Florence Motor and Myrtle Beach Speedways.

However when police went through a garbage can that had been put on the curb for pick-up, what they found was enough to arrest the retired race car driver and his housemate, according to MS News Now.

According to MS News Now, inside the can investigators discovered empty containers of drain cleaner, batteries and cold medicine - all known meth-making materials.

They also found numerous syringes, with one testing positive for meth.

Police then stormed the house and arrested Powell and a woman that also lives at the residence, Elma Buchanan.

Powell has been charged with possession of meth and manufacturing of meth.

Both bonded out of the Berkeley County Detention Center on Tuesday morning, according to Examiner.

In 1988 Powell became the youngest titlist to win a NASCAR series, aged 23.

He is from a successful racing family.

His older brother, Charles, was a national championship contender in 1984 and his father, Charley, was a star of southern dirt Late Model racing, according to Nascar.com.

Powell also competed in the NASCAR All-American Challenge series, the AutoZone Elite and Southeast series. 

However this is not Powell's first run-in with the law.

He has an extensive criminal history dating back to 1992, with multiple arrests. 

Among his offenses are forgery, burglary, assaulting a police officer, criminal domestic violence of an aggravated nature and assault of a high and aggravated nature.
