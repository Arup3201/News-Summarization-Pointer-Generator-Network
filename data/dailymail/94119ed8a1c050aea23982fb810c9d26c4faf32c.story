A heartbroken mother has confronted an allegedly drunk driver who smashed into the back of her car five years ago, leaving her son brain damaged.

Loubna Khader sobbed and smacked the glass divider at the Tarrant County Jail in Fort Worth, Texas as she came face-to-face with Stewart Richardson, who is still awaiting trial for the 2009 crash due to legal wrangling and appeals.

'It's been five years today! Five 
years!' Khader yelled at Richardson, WFAA-TV reported. 'My son is dying every single day... I am never going to 
forgive you for what you did to my son!'

Mrs Khader, her husband and her then two-year-old son Abdallah were driving back from a family gathering when Richardson rear-ended them, leaving the little boy trapped in his seat.

Confrontation: Loubna Khader is pictured yelling at Stewart Richardson - the man who smashed into the back of her family's car 5 years ago after allegedly drunk driving. The crash left her son, then 2, brain damaged

Anger: Khader is pictured yelling at Richardson and telling him that his apologies would change nothing

After the accident, doctors predicted 
that he had suffered damage to 80 per cent of his brain. He is now unable to
 see, speak or walk and needs around-the-clock care.

WFAA was there to film the moment Khader confronted Richardson, whose alcohol blood level was allegedly three times the limit when he crashed into the back of the family.

She raised an image showing Abdallah before the crash and then swapped it with one showing his bandaged face.

Richardson looked down as the mother yelled at him. He stayed for the entirely of her tirade and repeatedly apologized for her - but she would not accept it.

Changed: Abdallah, pictured left before the accident and right afterwards, became trapped in his child seat when Richardson rear-ended the family's car. He is now unable to see, talk, walk or care for himself

Devastated: Khader said after the meeting that she has tried to forgive Richardson but she can't

Face to face: Khader showed Richardson photos of her son before and after the life-changing crash

'I'm supposed to go home now and my son is going to be okay, because you said you’re sorry?' she said, before instructing him to be sent back to his cell.

Khader, who was unsure if Richardson would agree to meet her, had invited along the cameras to raise an understanding of her family's suffering and the long-term effects of drunk driving.

After the confrontation, she said: 'There's so many more things I wanted to tell him about my son - 
the things he goes through daily, but a man like him would 
never feel stuff like this.'

She said that, while the meeting was the start of her healing process and made her feel better, she will never be able to forgive the man who destroyed her son's life.

Remorse: Richardson, pictured left in his 2009 booking picture and right during the confrontation, said he had wanted to meet with Khader to let her know that he thinks about her son every day

Daily struggle: Khader is pictured with Abdallah, who now requires around-the-clock care

'I don't think there will ever be 
peace with this man,' she said. 'I tried so many times to convince 
myself to forgive him, because it's not going to change anything. But
 the minute I saw him, I just saw the devil in him.'

Richardson said he wanted to meet with Khader so she knows he thinks of her family every day.

'I made a mistake,' he told the news channel. 'And I want that family to know I’m trying to stand up for my mistake. To let them know that I love them, and I'm very sorry for what happened.'

He added that he keeps a news clipping of the accident in his cell so that he is always reminded of the crash. He said the family are the first people in his prayers.

His trial is on hold until an appeals 
court considers a request by prosecutors to use prior drunken driving 
charges in the case. He had seven prior arrests for DUI.
