It's a cold and windy Tuesday in February  and I'm on my way to Cheshire, looking - in my head - pretty glamorous.

And by glamorous, I mean that I have woken up half an hour earlier than I normally would, blow-dried, brushed AND straightened my hair and I have a full face of make-up on. All before 9am. 

Or at least I thought it was a full face of make up-until I arrived at Opium in Hale Barns, the salon owned by Ampika Pickston from the hit reality TV series, The Real Housewives of Cheshire.

The salon is full of silver, chandeliers and incredibly good-looking, very groomed people.

In fact, the pretty beauticians, who are busying themselves applying polish at the nail station, look better than I do on most nights out and I wonder if I have time to sneak into the toilet and shove on another layer of lipstick. 

I'm here to find out what it takes to look like the nation's new favourite reality stars - the glamorous women of Cheshire.

The breakout star of the show is Ampika, the tanned, big-haired straight-talking businesswoman who's also the only divorcee of the programme.

When I meet her in the flesh - all hair, legs and a pearly white smile to boot- she doesn't disappoint and it takes no time at all to feel like I'm in an episode of the ITV2 show. 

'Just wait til we're done with you,' she beams, leading me in to a treatment room complete with faux fur blanket  and offering me a glass of Champagne, which I politely decline as it's only 11.45 in the morning.

Facial time: Stacey cleansed Olivia's skin and removed her make-up before she started the procedure 

The first step in my Real Housewives makeover is a  CACI facial, which involves being prodded with what look like cattle prongs.

Thankfully, they don't feel like them though and the beautician Stacey Bolland explains that the probes, which feel like a firm massage, are lifting and re-shaping my face.

I'm pretty sceptical that it's doing anything at all but when the right side is finished she hands me a mirror and I have to say the results are pretty impressive. 

 The probes sent waves through Olivia's face which are supposed to lift and tighten her muscles

My face looks visibly lifted to the point that the left side now looks a little saggy in comparison, which, at 27, is not something you want to see.

The treatment, which is known as a non-surgical facelift, concludes with LED light therapy which is supposed to iron out the lines on your forehead. 

I resist saying that until this makeover started, I didn't even think I had any.

Next up is the Skinbreeze facial, which starts with an orbital microdermabrasion head that exfoliates the outer layer of your skin.

At the end of the Skinbreeze facial, Olivia's beautician Angela sprayed a relaxing mist over her face

This stings a bit but is soon cooled by a face mask. 

I ask Ampika how often she would recommend having the treatments done and she replies: 'If I could I would have one about every couple of weeks.

'It's important to maintain your skin. Our clients come in regularly and usually sign up for a course of ten treatments.'

Sounds like this real housewife malarkey is a lot of hard work. 

Angela Ferguson, who does the treatment, explains that the results are supposed to be like having the Botox without having to pump your face full of chemicals.

A second reveal shows my face is smooth and incredibly clean-looking and it does look tighter - there's something to this  'notox,' thing after all.

The only downside is that with the top layer of my skin removed, the emergency fake tan I had applied the night before is clear to see in a ring around my neck.

But it's a small price to pay for crystal clear skin and they assure me this can be covered with make-up later on. 

Next up came the task of picking a nail varnish to match my Karen Millen makeover dress - fresh from Ampika's own wardrobe with the tags still on.  

'I think you should go with a light colour, something classic,' says Ampika, who has owned the salon in the the leafy Cheshire suburb for the last year. 

Time for a wash: Kirsty washed Olivia's hair before getting to work on drying it and putting it into an extravagant up-do

Make-up complete: When the make-up was done you could no longer tell Olivia had a fake-tan error 

As I settle down at the nail bar, she brings me a glass of fizz and I begin to think I could get used to this Real Housewives lifestyle.

On the ITV2 show, Ampika and her fellow housewives Dawn Ward, Lauren Simon, Tanya Bardsley, Leanne Brown and Magali Gorre certainly do appear to live the high life. 

The women fill their weeks with Champagne brunches, charity galas and plenty of gossip. But there are some downsides, or at least 'odd' sides to starring in a successful television show. 

During my time at the salon, Ampika is bombarded with phone calls from a man pretending to be her ex-husband, Mark. 

While it seems he's just a harmless fan, it must be a bit disconcerting for her and her staff.

I ask her if it's been odd adjusting to life on the small screen. 

She says: 'It is very surreal, but mostly people are nice and I've had a lot of support.'

On the show, Ampika comes across as the tough one of the group but in real life she definitely has a softer side. 

She also has a strong work ethic that doesn't come across on the programme - she's very hands-on with the salon where she works seven days a week.

After my nails are finished, we head upstairs and she lends me her own make-up artist, Liz Clough, to begin the final steps of my transformation. 

'I always like to have a glamorous eye,' she advises, so I opt for the same.

It feels strange to be wearing so much make-up in the middle of the day but I must say the results are amazing. 

My skin looks flawless and I have contouring that even Kim Kardashian would be envious of. 

With my make-over nearly complete, Opium's hair-stylist Kirsty Dickson teases my hair into a giant bouffant do and it's time to slip on my dress. 

Ampika too slips into a new outfit - a breast-baring, leg-showing, showstopper of a gown that wouldn't put her out of place on Strictly Come Dancing.

As she's slipping into her costume, she says: 'When I'm in London I like to shop at Harrod's and Selfridges but I buy a lot of my clothes abroad as well as I hate to wear the same things as everyone else.'

As the day draws to a close and I wave goodbye to Ampika and the other salon staff, I can't help but feel a little sad to be leaving Cheshire. 

I'd certainly like to keep my Real Housewives look, if only I had my own hair-stylist and make-up artist...
