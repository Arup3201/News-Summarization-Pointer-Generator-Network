Here's one nativity scene you'd have trouble accomodating on the hall table.

This astonishing life-size depiction of the wise men visiting the infant Jesus has been made entirely from wool by an enthusiastic group of knitters, two of whom can be spotted among their creations.

It took six people nine months with nearly 7lb of wool used for each figure.

Oh holy knit... Incredible life-sized knitivity scene - with Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus all hand-made from wool. Alison Spurrall and Anne Iles (pictured) are part of the team that created the Christmas nativity scene

Festive scene: As well as Jesus, Mary and Joseph, you can see the wise men, the shepherds, an angel, a donkey and a camel. Alison Spurrall and Anne Iles pose with their needles

As well as Jesus, Mary and Joseph, you can see the wise men, the shepherds, an angel, a donkey and a camel.

Oh, and a sheep - well, all that wool has got to come from somewhere.

It is the work of a group called the Knutty Knitters, who all work at a school in Bristol.

After one of their founders, Christine Walsh, died last Christmas they decided to honour her with the mammoth task.

The scene is touring shopping centres to raise money for St Peter's Hospice in Bristol, where Ms Walsh was cared for. 

Little donkey: Even the animals have been lovingly recreated in wool. The whole scene used nearly 7lb of wool

Alison Spurrell, 52, pictured with colleague Anne Iles, seated, said: 'There are 13 figures now - three kings, two shepherds, Mary,  Joseph and baby Jesus, a sheep, a lamb, a donkey, a camel and the angel.

'For each figure we’ve used about three kilogrammes of wool, and about three  king-sized duvets for the stuffing.

'I had to write the pattern myself - using the basis of an original pattern and  scaling it up and tweaking it a bit.

'It’s been great fun - and my knitting has definitely improved along the way.'

And perfect to gather round for a spot of carol singing.

All together now: Silent knit, holy knit...
