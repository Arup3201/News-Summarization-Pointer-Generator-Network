Splashed out on a new sheer summer dress? Dug out those white trousers for the weekend? Then you, like me, risk the scourge of sunshine dressing: the dreaded Visible Panty Line (VPL).

While winter woollies and thick fabrics hide all manner of underwear sins, your summer wardrobe is another matter entirely. VPL was cited as Sixties supermodel Twiggy’s pet hate this week, when she advised women of a certain age to spend as much time looking in a rear view mirror before leaving the house, as they do in their bathroom one.

But how do you banish VPL? The good news is there’s an astonishing array of ‘invisible’ knickers said to be undetectable beneath even the flimsiest of clothing. 

Summer scourge: Charlotte isn't loving this unsightly case of VPL

But are these new breed of second skin undies really as effective as they are claimed to be?I road-tested 12 pairs ranging from £3 to £75 under a sheer frock and a pair of tight white trousers to find out which work and which don’t.

Florence and Fred No VPL Nude Knickers, £3, tesco.com

These
 are a hipster style with a generous cut where it counts across the 
rear.

The material has been laser cut so there are no seams, meaning the
 knickers sit flat against the skin. 

The lace panel might show up under
 some dresses but was totally invisible under light-coloured trousers.

Great value, too — I’m stocking up.

SCORE: 5/5

Sloggi Invisible Light Hipster in camel, £9, sockshop.co.uk

I tried the shimmery caramel shade, which was a little dark for my skin tone but would look very natural against tanned skin.

These
 have laser cut, scalloped edges at the back to avoid the seams that can
 give that tell-tale line under clothes and there’s no label to get in 
the way either — the washing instructions are printed on the fabric 
instead. But they are let down by the vertical back seam visible beneath
 the sheer dress.

Quite
 tight and high cut at the back so I had to go up a size to a size 12 to
 stop them digging in and  creating two bottoms.

SCORE: 3/5

M&S cotton No VPL Brazilian with stretch, £6, marksandspencer.com

Great
 everyday knickers if you are more of a J-Lo than a Gwyneth in the rump 
stakes.

The lace at the back gives discreet, reassuring coverage without
 leaving a line.

These comfy smalls were totally invisible under white 
trousers, though you could see a lacy shadow in places beneath the 
dress.

They were the most flattering by far, and cotton, too, so cool 
for summer.

SCORE: 4.5/5

Primark Secret Possessions seam-free full briefs, £5 for three, primark.com

Bridget Jones,
 eat your heart out. These are definitely in the passion killer category
 of big pants. But they are seamless and label-free so they give a 
smooth finish and are very soft — and reassuring if you like a high-cut 
style that covers the tummy.

The leg trim could be seen beneath the 
sheer dress, but there was no VPL under the white trousers.

SCORE: 3/5

Ultimo Invisible Thong, £10, ultimo.co.uk

Avoid
 these teeny tiny knickers unless you have a teeny tiny bottom.

There 
are no seams but the fabric was so tight fitting, even in a larger size,
 it pressed against my skin leaving unsightly bulges.

These smallest of 
smalls confirmed all my worst fears about wearing a thong at my age.

They were tight, hideously unflattering and within minutes I felt like I
 was being spliced with cheesewire.

SCORE: 1/5

Elle Macpherson Dentelle Culotte Brief, £25, houseoffraser.co.uk

These
 are white with pale pink trim. The back panel is made in a very fine, 
seamless netting which doesn’t cling and they are generously cut so that
 you feel you are wearing something substantial rather than simply 
wobbling about unsupported.

Sadly, the white fabric showed up beneath 
the sheer dress, but they’re great for jeans.    

SCORE: 4/5

Triumph Body Make Up Lace Tai Brief, £15, triumph.com

A pretty
 design that’s less skimpy than most and therefore much more flattering.
 Comfy, too.

Smooth across the bottom but the seams at the leg are quite
 bulky and so sadly were still visible beneath the white cropped 
trousers as well as under my favourite cream dress, which was 
disappointing. Had an unsightly label, too, that I had to cut out.

SCORE: 2.5/5

Studio La Perla Invisible Brief, £24, houseoffraser.co.uk

These
 come in a dark nude shade that would best suit darker skin tones.

Quite
 skimpy on, so not great for containing curves and I found they rode up 
at the back when worn.

I had no lines across the bottom cheeks but the 
sides were quite narrow, and, in my usual size, dug in to my hips 
creating unsightly bulges.

Bafflingly, they’re also hand-wash only.

SCORE: 1.5/5

Victoria’s Secret No-Show Seamless Thong, £11

Low
 cut at the front so there’s the risk of a muffin overspill, but the 
soft, stretchy fabric mercifully doesn’t dig into love handles at the 
back or sides so they are not too torturous to wear.

They’re
 great under white jeans, and invisible under the dress, but they won’t 
protect against cheek-wobble under a floaty skirt, so are only for the 
brave/under-30s/flat-bottomed.

SCORE: 4.5/5

Next No VPL shorts, £12 for a three-pack

These
 are not attractive. They look like hot pants and that’s only a good 
thing if you are Kylie Minogue.

But they did prove to be invisible under
 the sheer dress and gave some coverage and wobble-protection.

Sadly let
 down by the back seam and label, which could be seen under the white 
trousers.

SCORE: 4.5/5

Wolford Tulle Control Shorts, £75, wolford.com

These
 transparent control shorts are not at all pretty, but they were totally
 invisible under both the sheer dresses and the white trousers, and as 
an added bonus they kept all my wobbly bits in place.

There are no seams
 so they don’t dig in to the upper thigh or waist.

Just
 don’t wear them on a windy day or your skirt might flap up and reveal 
your secret.

They’re seriously expensive, but could prove an 
indispensable addition to your summer armoury if you need a little extra
 help.

SCORE: 5/5

Marks and Spencer Waist Cincher Knickers With No VPL, £19.50, marksandspencer.com

Tummy
 control pants can be the worst for digging in across the bottom, but 
these big beauties have seamless mesh panels at the top of the thigh and
 across the rear so that they lie flat against the skin and are 
completely invisible.

They
 cinched in the waist well, but its best to go up a size to avoid a roll
 of fat being pushed downwards to the upper thigh.

SCORE: 3.5/5
