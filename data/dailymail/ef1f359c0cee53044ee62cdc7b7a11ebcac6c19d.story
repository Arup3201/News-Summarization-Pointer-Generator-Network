Health tourists must be given free treatment by GPs because it is their human right, say NHS bosses.

New guidelines tell doctors across England they must register any foreign patient who asks for care otherwise it would be ‘discriminatory’. 

These include asylum seekers, overseas students or tourists coming for a short holiday. Once registered, they will be entitled to the same NHS care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests, jabs and – in some cases – free prescription drugs.

In fact, the new rules will give overseas patients more rights than those living in the UK who can be turned away from surgeries if they live a few yards outside its catchment area.

There are also fears the ruling will make it even harder for local patients to get an appointment.

Already half of patients cannot get an 
appointment with their doctor within 48 hours, according to the 
Government’s own figures.

Some family doctors are furious at the guidelines and describe them as a ‘charter for health tourism’.

They say that such patients, once 
registered at a surgery, will also find it far easier to be referred to 
hospital for thousands of pounds of free treatment.

By law, overseas patients are not entitled to be treated at hospital – unless it is urgent – but staff rarely check on their backgrounds.

Until now, GP practices were not  legally obliged to register foreigners  and many turn away patients if they do not have passports or ‘proof of address’ documents.

But the new guidelines issued to all doctors in England will change this.

One GP, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘I am not sure the British taxpayer should be paying for the world’s health treatment for free.’

And Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who is campaigning for tougher regulation on health tourism, said: ‘It is alarming that managers are passing these kind of diktats to doctors, many of whom are rightly  worried that GP registration is effectively buying free treatment on the NHS.

‘This is not just about the money, vital though that is – we cannot have the NHS, paid for by taxpayers, being abused by people who pay nothing into the system and who are not eligible for free care.’ 

Mr Skidmore has obtained figures showing that health tourists currently owe the NHS £40million in unpaid medical bills.

In the last year nearly 3,600 ‘overseas visitors’ have had hospital treatment worth at least £1,000 a time.

National guidelines say it would be discriminatory for GPs not to treat health tourists.

NHS London, one of four strategic health authorities in England, has backed up this advice with further guidelines explaining they will ‘promote human rights and public health’.

Dr Vijayakar Abrol, a GP who practises 
in Edgbaston, Birmingham, said: ‘The guidance is not worth the paper it 
is written on. We do not have endless resources. Why should we give 
these patients – be they from India, Canada, the US or Eastern Europe – 
free treatment?

‘We cannot go to those countries and get free treatment ourselves.’

Last week an investigation by BBC’s 
Panorama found that staff working at GP surgeries were taking bribes of 
£800 to register health tourists on surgery lists.

One manager, Asif Butt, who worked at a practice in Sparkhill, Birmingham, has since been suspended.

Some doctors say it is cost-effective – not to mention humane – to register overseas patients. 

Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of science and ethics at the British Medical Association, said it would be far cheaper to give patients insulin for diabetes, for example, rather than later treating them in A&E after they had fallen into a coma.

They also believe it could help prevent the spread of certain diseases such as tuberculosis which is commonly brought in by overseas patients.
