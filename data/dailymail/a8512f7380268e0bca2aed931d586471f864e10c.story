A church which was handed £67,000 in a will is facing bankruptcy after it emerged the cash was intended for a different church of the same name.

Parishioners at Holy Trinity Church in Milton Regis, Kent, thought their prayers were answered when they were apparently bequeathed the cash from a generous well-wisher.

Clergymen spent £6,000 repairing the roof and invested the rest in a year-long investment bond.

Error: Parishioners at Holy Trinity Church in 
Milton Regis, Kent, (pictured) have been wrongly bequeathed £67,000 from a well-wisher and they spent £6,000 repairing the church roof - but the money isn't theirs

Mistake: All the money was supposed to go to the Holy Trinity Church in Sittingbourne, (pictured) which is 
just 1.4 miles down the road from the other church but £61,000 has been invested in a year long bond

But it has now emerged that the money was actually meant for Holy Trinity Church in Sittingbourne, which is just 1.4 miles down the road.

Now lawyers have requested the money back which could send the church in Milton Regis into bankruptcy.

Parochial church council member Keith Nevols said: 'The bottom line is that the church might go bankrupt because the money given each month doesn’t match the outgoings.

'Bankruptcy may be a bit extreme but without the money we will be in great difficulty.'

Worshippers at the Milton Regis were stunned when the anonymous benefactor bequeathed the money in September last year.

But only 10 months later treasurer 
Sue Thomas received a letter from John Morley Solicitors, based in 
Sittingbourne, stating that they had made an error when administering 
the will.

Church leaders 
say they can cover the £6,000 already spent from other savings but the 
remaining £61,000 is tied up in a savings plan until February 2013.

Mr
Nevols added: 'We sought legal advice about whether we could claim 
against the solicitor for the £6,000 we have spent, but The Church of 
England advised us that we must give the money back and that, as it was 
an honest mistake, we should go no further.

Worried: Parochial church council member Keith Nevols said that the bottom line is that the church in Milton Regis might go bankrupt

'All
very Christian but it still puts us heavily out of pocket. Not only do 
we stand to lose £6,000 but the donation may have affected people giving
donations over the last few months.'

The two churches are now in negotiation about how and when the remaining money will be returned.

But
Ann Fagg, 72, a congregation member of the church, which is one of the 
three oldest in Kent, said that she thought some form of compensation 
should be paid to the church from the solicitors.

She said: 'It was a big mistake from the solicitors concerned and I think that there should be some compensation in it.

'It
is a big mistake to happen, but that’s only my opinion. We are a big 
church but we have a very elderly congregation with limited income so 
donations are limited too.

'We give a lot of the money we collect to charity, but at some point you have to look after yourself too.

'We do have money invested elsewhere so the part we spent we can pay back just about, but it will be getting the invested amounts back, we can’t access that until February 2013.

'We’re appealing for money now, we’re desperate, we don’t know how we will pay it.'

A joint statement issued by the Diocese of Canterbury and John Morley Solicitors said: 'We recognise that the unfortunate circumstances in this matter have arisen through no one’s deliberate fault.

'The Archdeacon of Maidstone, John Morley Solicitors and both parishes are working together to ensure a resolution of the problem that will give proper consideration to the best interests of both parishes and to effect an agreement by mutual consent.

'We are not expecting any further legal costs to be incurred.'

Clergymen at Holy Trinity Church in Milton Regis, Kent have already spent £6,000 repairing the roof

They've got to pay the whole lot back but the rest is stuck in a savings investment bond until 2012

It actually belongs to a church 1.4miles away and there are calls for the Milton Regis church to be compensated
