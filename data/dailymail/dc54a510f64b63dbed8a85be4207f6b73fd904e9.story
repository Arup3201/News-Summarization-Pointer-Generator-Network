Southampton have emerged as favourites to sign Italy starlet Gianluca Scamacca.

Dubbed the 'new Zlatan Ibrahimovic' by Italian media, the 6ft 4ins 15-year-old centre-forward is on Roma's books but is ready to move abroad.

Roma will offer the Italy U17 international a three-year contract when he turns 16 on January 1, initially starting on £1,142 a month.

However, his family and agent are keen to see what is on offer abroad where he can earn considerably more. 

Scamacca, who has scored 34 goals in 30 games for Roma's youth side, spent time at PSV Eindhoven's training ground recently and they were confident of striking a deal.

Now though, Southampton have moved into pole position.
