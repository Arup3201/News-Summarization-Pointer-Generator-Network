Ukip leader blamed Western foreign policy and mass immigration for ‘much of what has happened'

Nigel Farage risked sparking fresh outrage today after claiming European governments bore some ‘culpability’ for the Paris massacres.

The Ukip leader blamed Western foreign policy and mass immigration for ‘much of what has happened’.

His remarks come after he was attacked by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg for claiming there was a ‘fifth column’ in Britain.

But speaking in the European Parliament, Mr Farage brushed aside the claims he was ‘seeking to divide’ the country for political points.

He told MEPs: ‘We need an honest admission that actually our political decisions have led to much of what has happened.

‘Just think about foreign policy – from Afghanistan through Iraq, through Libya and even the attempt to arm the rebels in Syria.

‘All of these we were told to make our streets safer, when in fact what we have done is stir up real resentments within the Muslim community and it’s had the very opposite effect.’

He added that ‘mass immigration’ had ‘made it frankly impossible for many new communities to integrate’.

But Mr Farage said: ‘Perhaps worst of all we have been guilty of weakness – lack of courage – a lack of assertion of who we are as people.

‘We’ve turned a blind eye to many of our minority communities to practises that would not be tolerated in the rest of the population.

‘We’ve allowed preachers of hate to go around saying things that are totally unacceptable.

‘The result of all this is we have a fifth column living in our communities that is utterly opposed to our values and how we deal with that is vital for the future.

‘Unless we are prepared to admit our own culpability in much of what has happened we are not going to be able to find solutions.

‘We are going to have to be a lot braver and courageous in standing up for our Judeo Christian culture.’

Mr Farage was last week criticised for 'inflaming' tensions after the Muslim Council of Britain insisted there can be no justification for the 'barbaric' attack on the office of a French satirical magazine.

Mr Cameron said it was wrong to use the attacks to 'make political remarks or arguments' while Mr Miliband insisted: 'I don't think Nigel Farage or anyone else should be seeking to divide us in this way.'

Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg said: 'I am dismayed that Nigel Farage immediately thinks, on the back of the bloody murders that we saw on the streets of Paris yesterday, his first reflex is to make political points.'

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims

He told LBC: 'If this does come down, as it appears to be the case, to two individuals who perverted the cause of Islam to their own bloody ends, let's remember that the greatest antidote to the perversion of that great world religion are law-abiding British Muslims themselves.

'And to immediately ... imply that many, many British Muslims - who I know feel fervently British but also are very proud of their Muslim faith - are somehow part of the problem rather than part of the solution is firmly grabbing the wrong end of the stick.'

But Britain’s first elected Muslim Cabinet minister yesterday insisted it was ‘lazy’ to claim Islam had nothing to do with last week’s terror attacks in France.

It comes after Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said there was ‘no getting away’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves Muslims.

Mr Javid also called on British Muslims to do more to tackle extremism – claiming they had a ‘special burden’ because so many of the attacks were carried out by fanatics who claim inspiration from Islam.

The former banker, who became the first Muslim Tory MP after being elected in 2010, attacked the ‘barbaric’ terrorists responsible for last week’s atrocities.

Mr Javid said: ‘The lazy answer from people out there is to say that this had got nothing whatsoever to do with Islam and Muslims and that should be the end of that part of the debate.

‘That is lazy and that would be wrong. You can’t get away from the fact that these people are using Islam, they are taking a great religion, a peaceful religion of a billion people around the world, taking this religion and using it as their tool to carry out their horrible activities.’

Mr Javid said because of this there was a ‘special burden’ on Muslims to deal with Islamic extremism.

He said: ‘All communities can do more to try and help and deal with terrorists, try and help track them down, but I think it is absolutely fair to say that there is a special burden on Muslim communities, because whether we like it or not, these terrorists call themselves Muslims.

‘It is no good for people to say they are not Muslims, that is what they call themselves. They do try to take what is a great peaceful religion and warp it for their own means.’
