Imposing boardroom quotas for women would be 'patronising' and wrong, Women's Minister Maria Miller said yesterday.

In a major speech on women's role in the economy yesterday, Mrs Miller dismissed a drive by the European Commission to impose a minimum 40 per cent quota for women on company boards.

She said more still needed to be done on both equal opportunities and pay, but insisted policy would not be driven by 'political correctness'.

Removing barriers: Women's Minister Maria Miller has called for greater support in helping women reach their goals rather than imposing quotas

'It makes no sense to stifle the achievement and aspiration of 50 per cent of our society.

'It is absolutely essential that we maximise the contribution that women can make to our economy.

'Not because of political correctness, but because of economic reality. Now more than ever, we need to remove barriers to the workplace.

'The way to do this is not through special treatment or regulation like the European Commission's quotas idea, which patronises women and undermines the business case.

'It is about removing the barriers to achieving their goals, and so that women are supported all the way from the shop floor to the boardroom.'

Sources in Brussels last night said the EU was poised to abandon its controversial quota plans because of opposition from Britain and other countries.

Mrs Miller also unveiled a £2 million scheme to boost childcare and help more women find a job.

Grants of up to £500 will be available from next April for people setting up a nursery or childminding business.

The money will help cover legal and insurance costs, health and safety training and equipment, while advice and mentoring will also be offered.

Mrs Miller hopes £2million scheme will boost female entrepreneurs

Mrs Miller said the scheme would create jobs and help reverse a decline in the number of childminders, which has been identified as a barrier for women wanting to return to work.

She said: 'The childcare industry is already a major employer of women, and this scheme will provide huge opportunities for female entrepreneurs to start up and run their own businesses.

'This is an injection of cash designed to stimulate the sector in tough times, the new scheme will provide more childcare places but will also help get up to 6,000 new childcare businesses off the ground.
