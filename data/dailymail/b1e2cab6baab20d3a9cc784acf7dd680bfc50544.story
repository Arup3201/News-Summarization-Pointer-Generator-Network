Model, actress and now reality TV star, Katia Elizarova, 27, is clearly no shrinking violet. But even a woman as self-possessed as Elizarova found dealing with fashion's unpleasant underbelly a challenge.

Now, she's using her new found fame to shine a light on the challenges faced by the industry's teenage models and is calling for change.

'There are people who try to bring you into clubs to attract the attention of older men,' Elizarova revealed in a candid interview with the Times.

'This is not a nice part of our job. If you’re a model and your agency hasn’t paid you in months, you don’t have anything to eat — and then someone comes over and says, "We’re doing free dinners in the club, come and bring your girlfriends," of course you go.

'Then you have 20 men perving at you, but you’re so hungry you don’t care.'

Elizarova, who is currently starring in Fox TV reality show Meet The Russians and treading the boards in her role as an unhappily married woman in new play Sunstroke, made her name modelling for Chanel, M&S and MaxStudio among others.

The model was scouted in her home town of Saratov at the age of 14 and has seen plenty of things to dislike during the 12 years she has spent working.

Among them, she reveals, are girls aged 16 or 17 being drugged by men or falling down drunk, and constant pressure to lose pounds from already skinny frames.

Even Elizarova, although a slender size 8, came under pressure to lose weight, telling of how, when working in Japan, she and other girls would be weighed after lunch.

Although still modelling, Elizarova has now made it her mission to speak out about what she sees as exploitation of young, vulnerable girls and has even taken part in an Oxford Union debate about size zero.

She's also been linked to Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch with whom she was seen getting cosy during a summer wedding in Ibiza.

'It was a wedding, you know, everyone was jolly and happy and, you know, things happen...' she told the Times.

Evasive though she might be on the subject of Cumberbatch, she has no such qualms when it comes to her thoughts on young models.

'I knew girls who were bulimic, who used cocaine to make their cheeks hollow,' she adds. 'Some girls pulled out their teeth to look thinner.'

For now though, she says she's confining her efforts to the UK, although she adds that she does have plans to start helping to tackle the problem in her home country when she feels strong enough.
