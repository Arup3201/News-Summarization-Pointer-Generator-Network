Disney-owned Marvel Comics, the publisher of X-Men, Spiderman, and The Incredible Hulk, has come under fire for manufacturing 'sexist' T-shirts that portray women as weak, and men as strong.

Two T-shirts based on the popular Avengers comic franchise use the same 'hero' slogan, but play off deeply ingrained traditional gender roles.

A blue shirt for boys declares, 'Be A Hero,' while a red shirt for girls says, 'I Need A Hero.'

Controversial slogan: Two T-shirts based on the popular Avengers comic franchise use the same 'hero' slogan, but play off deeply ingrained traditional gender roles - this one for women costs $24.50

While the boys shirt is for juniors and the girls shirt comes in adult sizes for women, both tops are available online at DisneyStore.com.

A description of the women's T-shirt, $24.50, says: 'If you ''Need a Hero,'' then we've got four of the toughest on this 
Avengers tee for women. The Hulk, Thor, Captain America and Iron Man 
team up on this 100% cotton v-neck tee with silver glitter highlights.'

Meanwhile the boys T-shirt, $16.50, exclaims: 'They'll suit-up for super-powered fun in the invincible Iron Man's athletic jersey style tee for boys.'

Disappointed customers have voiced their frustrations at the T-shirts' heteronormative messages.

Only for boys: A T-shirt made exclusively for boys, $16.50, exclaims: 'They'll suit-up for super-powered fun in the invincible Iron Man's athletic jersey style tee'

Lindsey Weedston wrote: 'These shirts are 
representative of and perpetuate a widespread problem that separates 
girls and boys at an early age, encouraging gender roles that tell boys 
to be violent and girls not to complain about violence committed upon 
them.'

Petition siteÂ Change.org has hosted two recent petitions from women's advocacy groups, calling for Disney to stop selling the 'sexist' shirts.

'This sends a harmful message about who can and cannot be a leader in this world,' the petition, with nearly 7,000 signatures and created by Miss Representation, states.

The Avengers: The 2012 American superhero film produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, is based on the Marvel Comics Avengers superhero team

'These shirts promote the idea that men and boys are meant to do the saving, and that women and girls are the ones who need to be saved.'

Another petition from Powered by Girl, explains: These shirts reflect the antiquated, sexist gender roles that Disney has worked so hard to move away from in the past few years.

'I love Disney movies...What I don't love is seeing the same old assumptions and gender roles being taught to a new generation. The "Be a Hero" t-shirt is made exclusively for boys, with no girls or even unisex version available.'
