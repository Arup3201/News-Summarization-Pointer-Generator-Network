She's been dubbed a child prodigy, a genius and 'the binary wunderkind'.

But Akiane Kramarik says everyone  is blessed with a gift - she simply found hers at the very tender age of three.

Art has become a way of life for the 20-year-old, who grew up in a small town of Illinois in what she described as a 'dirty shack' with no television, no radio, no friends or relatives.

Coming from a background of financial hardship, it was a surreal experience for the young artist when she was first discovered by Oprah Winfrey and featured on her show at just eight years of age.

Since then, she's gone on to publish best-selling books and paintings which are valued at millions of dollars.

Having lived and explored more than 30 countries with her family, they've finally decided to settle down in Australia with hopes of opening up a gallery and and an international arts academy for aspiring artists.

Akiane Kramarik began drawing at the age of three as she grew up in a small town of Illinois, US, with no television, no radio, no friends or relatives

When she started having vivid dreams at a very young age, the artist felt the urge to express them through art

Coming from a background of financial hardship, it was a surreal experience for the young artist when she was first discovered by Oprah Winfrey and featured on her show at just eight years of age

For more than 10 years, Ms Kramarik has woken up at 3am every morning to gather her thoughts and to begin creating another one of her masterpieces.

It's this kind of discipline that's driven the US artist from virtually nothing to renowned success.

But none of her values and goals have changed as she's remains humble and grateful for the support she's had over the years, especially from her parents and four brothers.

'I grew up in a very nurturing family,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'We were financially extremely poor. We literally lived day by day and had no TV or radio.

'I remember my mother actually going from door to door, introducing herself and wanting to make friends with people but no one was welcoming of us.

'So we led our lives in nature and spent a lot of time together as a family. That's how we picked things up and learned about life.'

Then began her vivid dreams.

'I was so young but started having these visions and impressions of the world,' Ms Kramarik said.

'I was just so surprised at the impeccable images I had in my head that I just had to express them in some sort of physical matter.

'So I began sketching on anything and I remember these drawings scattered around the dirty shack we used to live in.'

Since then, she's gone on to publish best-selling books and valuable paintings

When the drawings were noticed by Ms Kramarik's parents, they saved up to buy her a sketch book and pencil to help her explore her new-found talent

When these drawings were noticed by Ms Kramarik's parents, they saved up to buy her a sketch book and pencil to help her explore her new-found talent.

'That's when I started to take my art very seriously,' Ms Kramarik said.

'Then as I turned seven, I gradually moved onto pastels and started painting on large canvases that were much bigger than me.'

It was from this moment that she began her early morning 3am rituals.

'It's the most peaceful time for me as I can slowly get lost in the world I'm painting,' she said.

'It really is the best thing I do every day and I don't plan on changing my routine any time soon.' 

At the age of eight, she completed her first five-foot long oil painting and made her first TV appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show.

'I was so young then plus I didn't grow up with TV, so had no idea about what kind of person Oprah was,' Ms Kramarik said.

'It was only after I came off her show that I understood how influential she was as it really opened up a path for me.'

Since then, she's also met the likes of TV host Craig Ferguson and former anchor of Good Morning America Diane Sawyer.

Ms Kramarik - who many in the art community refer as 'the binary wunderkind' - deeply struggled with the labels she's been given as a child

Looking back, Ms Kramarik believes all the emotional and financial hardship she's endured over the years have been worth every little bit

Having lived and explored more than 30 countries with her family, they've finally decided to settle down in Australia with hopes of opening up a gallery and and an international arts academy for aspiring artists

But Ms Kramarik - who many in the art community refer as 'the binary wunderkind' - deeply struggled with the labels she's been given as a child.

'Before I went on Oprah there was a lot of judgement from people around me because they didn't believe the paintings and drawings were by me,' she said.

'People wanted to burn all my works when we tried to display them in public. That made me doubt myself and my talents.

'But then once I was discovered and people started labelling me - it was also hard to live up to those expectations.'

Despite all this, the gifted artist has gone on to publish two best-selling books of poems as well as paintings which are worth $10,000 up to $3 million.

Looking back, Ms Kramarik believes all the emotional and financial hardship she's endured over the years have been worth every little bit.

And this year, she's keen to start working on some of her lifelong goals here in Australia.

'Me and my family moved to the Gold Coast (southeastern Queensland) about six months ago and it's just perfect,' Ms Kramarik said.

'This is our second home and we've completely fallen in love with its charm.' 

The 20-year-old hopes to open up an art gallery and an international arts academy in Australia for aspiring artists.

'It's still in the planning process but I'm really excited about giving back to the community, inspiring people and helping others find their talents,' she said.

'I was lucky enough to meet such great people during my journey so I hope I can somehow do the same for others.'
