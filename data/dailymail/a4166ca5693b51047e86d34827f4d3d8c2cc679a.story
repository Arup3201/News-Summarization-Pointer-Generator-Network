The only official Government report into future Romanian and Bulgarian migration into Britain has been branded a ‘whitewash’ – after it failed to answer the key question of how many would arrive next year.

From January 1, EU controls on workers from the two countries will expire, allowing almost 29million people free access to work here.

Following repeated refusals by ministers to estimate how many will come, the £30,000 Foreign Office-commissioned study said it was ‘not possible to predict the scale of future migration’ from the two EU countries.

However, the report did warn an influx could lead to pressure on already scarce primary school places, and of high levels of diseases such as measles among Romanian nationals.

The lack of estimate provoked ridicule from commentators and backbench Tory MPs.

The MigrationWatch think-tank has predicted about 50,000 Romanian and Bulgarian migrants could come here every year from next year.

Chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘This report is a bucket of whitewash. In 60 pages it provides no estimate whatever. It doesn’t even address the only estimate published so far, by MigrationWatch.’

‘It brushes aside any indication of an increase in migration from these countries.’

Experts say the lack of any firm 
estimate makes it impossible to prepare for the extra pressure new 
arrivals could put on public services. They also fear the most 
significant disruption could be felt in the jobs market.

The report, by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, was published today despite officials receiving it ‘in draft’ as early as December last year. 

It blamed lack of ‘current data’ on how many migrants are here, and said there was ‘no agreed definition’ of what migration was.

It said: ‘Estimates of potential migration to the UK are likely to be inaccurate and misleading and our report does not include these.’ It suggested Romanians and Bulgarians will migrate to Spain and Italy – despite much higher unemployment levels there. It said: ‘Survey evidence suggests the UK is not a strongly favoured location.’ 

The report did warn that families arriving with children could ‘potentially increase pressure’ on primary school places, and are likely to claim child benefit and other  in-work benefits such as tax credits. 

It pointed to high levels of measles, mumps and rubella among Romanian nationals and high rates of tuberculosis. And it said there could be ‘added pressure’ on housing.

Those who come are likely to be under 35 and working in low-skilled jobs, it said.

According to a British Labour Force survey, there are 26,000 Bulgarians and 80,000 Romanians already living in the UK.

Last month, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles admitted the Government had ‘no idea’ about the size of the possible influx.

Tory MP Philip Hollobone said: ‘I think they have avoided answering that question because the numbers are likely to be huge.’
