Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has blasted the club's transfer dealings on Twitter, believing they made a huge error in not signing a centre back and defensive midfielder this summer.

The Gunners lie seventh in the Premier League currently, already finding themselves 11 points behind leaders Chelsea, and Frimpong says the £30million that was spent on bringing Alexis Sanchez to the club would have been better utilised elsewhere.

The 22-year-old, who now plays in Russia for FC Ufa, vented his frustrations on the social networking site during Arsenal's Champions League game against Anderlecht.

Frimpong says too many of Arsenal's squad are similar in their style

Frimpong says Arsenal should have spent money on a centre-half and a defensive midfielder rather than Alexis Sanchez this summer

He said: 'Said it and will say it again we need a F***king centre-back with Laurent a bloody DMF and a bloody striker.

'And before you start going down on me it's bloody true all our players are so similar, Jack, Ramsey Arteta, Chambo, Sanchez, Ozil, all too similar.

'FFS Sanchez has had a good season but no disrespect would have been better using that to buy a centre back and a DMF bloody sick of it man.'

Emmanuel Frimpong still has a close affinity for Arsenal despite being released by the club in the summer

Alexis Sanchez has impressed for Arsenal since signing from Barcelona but Frimpong thinks the money spent on him should have utilised better elsewhere

Ironically, Arsenal went on to recover from going 1-0 down against the Belgian champions, with Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski both scoring late on, as Arsene Wenger's side ensured it would be a birthday to remember for their manager, on the day he turned 65.

Next up for the Gunners is a trip to Sunderland on Saturday as they look to get their faltering league form back on track against Gus Poyet's side.
