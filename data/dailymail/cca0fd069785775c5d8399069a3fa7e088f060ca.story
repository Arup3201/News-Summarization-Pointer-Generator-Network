A Sydney man has been charged with  using a five-year-boy, believed to be his nephew, as a drug mule. 

Detectives arrested a 34-year-old man at a home in Woolloomooloo, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, around 8am on Tuesday. 

Police allege they witnessed the man selling heroin from his Dowling St home earlier this month.
