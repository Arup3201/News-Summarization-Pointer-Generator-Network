Not content with second spot at FIFA's goal of the year award, Republic of Ireland women's forward Stephanie Roche has added another wondergoal to her collection.

The 25-year-old came in just behind Colombia forward James Rodriguez's World Cup superstrike in the 2014 Puskas award contenders - and if this effort is anything to go by she could be walking FIFA's red carpet alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi again this year.

Last year Roche took three touches before smashing in from outside the box for Peamount United against Wexford Youths, but this time she needed just two to find the net with a brilliant dipping shot from 20 yards out for the Republic of Ireland against Costa Rica.

Latching on to a cross-field ball from Diane Caldwell, Roche took a touch to control the ball before striking it in mid-air over the goalkeepers head and into the net. 

After the game Roche said that her coaches had been telling the side to make sure they improved their finishing.

'Sue (Ronan) and Paul (Martyn) and the rest of the staff have been telling us that we have to finish our chances,' Roche said.

'I was glad that I had the opportunity to get the shot off.

'I gave Denise (O’Sullivan) a shout because I knew it was on my better foot, and luckily enough she left it for me and I managed to get it out of my feet and get a shot.'

Ireland ran out 2-1 winners with Megan Campbell adding a second goal before a Reid Burke own goal pulled one back for the visitors.
