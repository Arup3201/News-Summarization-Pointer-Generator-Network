The new Defence Secretary personally overruled an ‘outrageous and juvenile’ attempt to make the Red Arrows trail the colours of the Scottish flag at the Commonwealth Games.

Michael Fallon reacted with fury when told of the plan for the famous jet display team, part of Britain’s Royal Air Force, to replace their traditional red, white and blue smoke with just white and blue, representing the Scottish Saltire.

It would have been a highly political statement just weeks ahead of a referendum in Scotland on whether the country should become independent, breaking up the 300-year-old union with England.

A guide handed to journalists at Wednesday night’s spectacular opening ceremony stated that as the Queen’s car came into the stadium, the ‘nine hawks of the Red Arrows fly overhead in a v-formation trailing blue and white smoke’.

However, in the event, the jets trailed their traditional three colours, representing the Union Flag, to huge cheers from the 40,000-strong crowd inside Glasgow’s Celtic Park.

TV images of the flypast, and the warmth of the welcome extended by the Scottish crowd to the Monarch, were seen as a blow to nationalist First Minister Alex Salmond’s campaign to persuade Scots to back independence in the September 18 referendum.

A senior Government source revealed the request for the Red Arrows to produce white and blue smoke was overruled at the last minute by Mr Fallon, appointed to lead the Ministry of Defence in last week’s wide-ranging Government reshuffle.

‘Michael Fallon personally refused the request. They wanted white and blue, but the Red Arrows are part of the Royal Air Force, keeping all of Britain safe.

‘The Secretary of State was not about to let politics interfere with our Armed Forces,’ the source said.

A defence source added: ‘It’s just bizarre. Can you imagine England asking for just red and white for their events? Or Wales doing this same?

‘The Red Arrows have never flown with any other colours because they represent the United Kingdom. That’s what they do. You cannot request different colours.’

Former Labour defence minister John Spellar said: ‘Frankly, this would have been both outrageous and juvenile. In their reaction to the Red Arrows trailing red, white and blue, the Scottish crowd gave a very clear answer to the people who wanted to play games with the Games.’

Mr Salmond promised not to play politics with the Commonwealth Games, saying he would not use the event to push his campaign for Scottish independence.

However, opponents say he has already broken that pledge by predicting this week that Glasgow will vote yes in the referendum and become ‘Freedom City’.

The First Minister also used a press conference at the Games’ main media centre to attack George Osborne and suggest Scottish sporting teams would ‘flourish’ after independence.

Mr Salmond has been accused of hijacking major sporting events in the past – prompting fury when he unfurled a Scottish flag behind the Prime Minister’s head when Andy Murray won Wimbledon last year. Mr Murray condemned the stunt, saying he ‘didn’t like it’.

The Scottish First Minister also urged people to back ‘Scolympians’, a term he personally coined instead of Team GB to describe Scotland’s competitors at the 2012 London Olympics.

Red Arrows insiders insist they only ever use red, white and blue smoke, wherever they are booked to perform

Commonwealth Games organisers blamed a typing error in the guide which could not be corrected before it went to press

In an initial statement, a spokesman for the Commonwealth Games said that there had been no plan for the Red Arrows to trail blue and white smoke, and the reference to such a flypast in the guide had been a typing error.

‘It was a mistake that was done in the editing. It was always the case that there would be the three colours,’ the spokesman said.

But later, the position changed. A spokesman said: 'Glasgow 2014 would like to clarify that it was its ceremony’s producers who had initial conversations about Red Arrows trailing blue and white smoke to represent the host nation’s Saltire, but this was never formally requested.

'We were delighted with the participation of the Red Arrows who deployed their standard trail of red, white and blue in the ceremony.'

A source close to Mr Salmond insisted the First Minister had not been aware of the request for blue and white smoke by the Games organisers.

A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘The Scottish Government made no such approach regarding the Red Arrows whose flypast was a spectacular highlight of a fantastic opening ceremony. Any claims to the contrary are completely untrue.

‘Glasgow 2014, as organisers of the Games, independently contract a private company to organise and stage the opening and closing ceremonies.

‘An approach was made by them to the MoD to explore whether it would be possible to have blue and white smoke in recognition of Scotland as the host Commonwealth nation. We believe that ultimately the UK Government did not want to proceed with this suggestion.’

Alex Salmond has been accused of abandoning his pledge not to use the 2014 Games to score political points 

The opening and closing ceremonies of the Games have been produced on behalf of the organisers by US-based brand agency Jack Morton Worldwide, which was also behind the Commonwealth Games ceremonies in Manchester in 2002 and Melbourne in 2006.

It is understood the agency held informal discussions in February, and one insider suggested that initially no objections were raised to the idea of the Red Arrows using white and blue smoke.

A spokesman for the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence said: ‘If there was any attempt by the nationalists to play politics like this with Glasgow's Games it will be frowned upon by Scots.

‘The Red Arrows are loved by people in Scotland and right across the whole UK.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Red Arrows are ambassadors for the United Kingdom and are famous for their red, white and blue smoke trails which represent the whole of the UK.

‘The flypast was to celebrate the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, the Commonwealth and the presence of Her Majesty so it was fitting that red, white and blue were used.’

The most recent poll of polls suggests Mr Salmond’s independence dream is likely to be crushed, indicating a 14-point lead for the no campaign.
