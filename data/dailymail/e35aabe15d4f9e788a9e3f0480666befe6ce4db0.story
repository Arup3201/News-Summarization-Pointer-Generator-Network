Mama June has had a glamorous makeover for the Here Comes Honey Boo Boo series of Holladay Specials.

The family matriarch, 33, who had greying curls pulled back off her face in previous episodes, debuts a new blonde hairdo in a preview clip, with straightened, shoulder-length locks.

She also appears to have had fake tan applied, completing the transformation.

One imagines that the makeover was inspired by the family's newfound fame - June is now photographed wherever she goes.

There may be a story behind it though. When asked for more information about June's new look, a TLC spokesman would only say that 'viewers will have to tune in to the episode to find out.'

The preview clip of the first Holladay Special, which airs on Sunday night, sees the mother-of-four reveal her fear of mayonnaise.

Though she visibly shudders at the mention of the condiment, June admits that she will eat potato salad or tuna salad, as long as she has not witnessed it being prepared.

Freaking out: Mama's distress is visible as her girls goad her with exclamations of, 'Look, it's so yummy!'

'If I watch somebody make it, I can't [eat] it,' she says. 'The reason why is 
because when I was growing up, the babysitter I had [would make] mayonnaise 
sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack... I can't talk 
about it, this is making my flesh crawl!'

'I think it's stupid that you're scared of mayonnaise, Mama, I mean 
seriously, it's mayonnaise ... It's
like ketchup but white'

In a bid to help their mother conquer her fear, the four girls decide to take action, by attempting to explain how ridiculous she is being.

16-year-old Jessica, also known to the family as 'Chubbs', says: 'I think it's stupid that you're scared of mayonnaise, Mama, I mean 
seriously, it's mayonnaise, it's white and it's mayonnaise. C'mon, that's
like ketchup but it's just white.'

When asked why she doesn't eat 
mayonnaise, Jessica says that it is because she is a vegetarian, 
sparking ridicule from the whole family.

Mama asks: 'When did you become a damn vegetarian?'

Lauryn, aka 'Pumpkin', 13, adds: 'Marannaise does not have meat in it.'

The pair then embark on a bizarre argument, that doesn't involve Jessica at all, in which they both seem to be making the same case.

It ends with Pumpkin insisting that 'you could just make a marannaise sammich', causing Mama to shudder, and Pumpkin to then do an uncanny imitation.

With the family discussion ending in failure, seven-year-old Alana, Jessica and eldest sister Anna 'Chickadee', 17, decide to present Mama with a large bowl of mayonnaise.

'Coming from the kitchen with the mayonnaise to the dining room, you could feel the tension in there,' Jessica reveals.

The bright stuff: Alana hollows a pumpkin

As the girls goad their mother with exclamations of, 'Look, it's so yummy!' and 'It jiggles, it's pretty!' June gets increasingly distressed.

'My anxiety levels is up like beyond out the roof,' she says. 'I mean like my chest is real tight, my throat feels like its gonna close up... Y'all gotta get that outta there, c'mon now...Â  I'm gonna go into full panic ******* attack... Y'all gotta get it outta here FOR REAL!'

She failed to find much sympathy from Alana, who recalls afterwards: 'Mama was turning white, just like mayonnaise.'

The first episode in the Holladay Specials sees the family prepare for Halloween. According to a precis of the episode from TLC, a pumpkin carving incident ends with Uncle Poodle stuck inside a one of the gourds and the family gets hopelessly lost in a corn maze.

A freak accident leaves Pumpkin unable to go trick-or-treating, and June's new look nspires love-struck Sugar Bear to surprise her with an unlikely costume.
