Home invasion survivor Dr William Petit and his wife Christine have released a new image of their nine-day-old son wearing an adorable watermelon hat as he looks up at his doting father.

Mrs Petit shared the heart-melting picture of baby William on her photograph company's Facebook page on Sunday, adding that her little bundle of joy 'cries to eat and that's about it. [He's] very calm.'

William's birth on November 23 - a week after his due date - heralded a new chapter of happiness for the couple, six years after Dr Petit's wife and two daughters were killed in a grisly home invasion.

He was named William Petit III after 
his father and grandfather and, soon after, the couple released an image
showing the dark-haired boy wearing a blue baby-gro and lying on a 
blanket.

Hello Daddy! Baby William Petit, who is now nine days old, looks up at his father, Dr William Petit, in a new image released by the family. His birth comes six years after Dr Petit's family was killed in a home invasion

They added: 'Happiest and sweetest time ever...our new little son, William. So in love!'

Hundreds of well-wishers posted comments and shared the photo, to which Mrs Petit responded: 'Thank you! Over the moon, he's so chill too. Eats like a champ.'

Baby William brings happy news for Dr Petit whose first wife Jennifer and two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela, were raped and murdered in a horrific attack at the family's Connecticut home in 2007. 

The family was held hostage for hours
at their Cheshire home before it was set alight by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky. Dr Petit 
was severely beaten and dumped in the basement but managed to escape.

Happy: The couple (at their wedding last year) met when she offered to take photos for his foundation

Bundle of joy: William Arthur Petit III was born on November 23 to Christine Petit and her husband Dr William Petit

Joy: Christine Petit (second left) and her husband, Dr William Petit, announced in August they are expecting their first child together as they looked after William's niece

After the tragedy, Dr Petit met Christine Paluf at his local country club when she offered to volunteer for the Petit Family Foundation, which was created in the memory of his late wife and daughters. 

When the killers went on trial in 
2011, Christine was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the 
courthouse along with his relatives and listening through hours of agonizing 
testimony.

Last year they married and moved into a small home in Farmington River in western Connecticut.

Shortly before their first wedding anniversary 
on August 5, they announced that they were expecting a child.

When
local news station WFSB interviewed the couple before the birth, Petit 
said he was very excited about the prospect of a new baby and ready to 
start changing diapers again.

Responding to the reporter's question 
about starting a family again, Dr Petit turned somber, saying ‘children 
are always your jewels'.

‘Children
are the hope for the future,’ he said with a catch in his throat, 
adding that most parents aim to teach children how to be good people and
help others.

Deadly scene: Michaela and her 17-year-old sister, Hayley, 
were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the house was
doused in gas and set on fire

Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack

Dr Petit retired from practicing medicine after losing his wife and daughters, and he has now dedicated his life to the foundation.

He has been approached about running for Congress and told reporters he was considering it after having talks with Republican Party officials.

His foundation aims to foster the education of young people, especially women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by violence.
