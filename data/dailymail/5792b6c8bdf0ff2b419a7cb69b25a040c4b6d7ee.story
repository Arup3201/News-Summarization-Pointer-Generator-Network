Angela Brower made the brave move of breaking up with her boyfriend of six months after he started becoming physically and verbally abusive.

But on May 18, when Walter Bradley came over to collect his things, the 37-year-old Tennessee woman was allegedly viciously attacked.

Brower says she was punched so hard she was knocked out and woke to still find the man beating her.

She managed to plead with him to spare her life, The Huffington Post reports.

Her ex-boyfriend has been charged with aggravated assault, according to WREG News Channel 3, and Brower has taken it upon herself to spread awareness about domestic violence.

The Memphis mom has posted pictures of her injuries and subsequent recovery on her Facebook page since the attack, first writing:'Does this look like LOVE TO ANYONE OF YOU?'

'I just want everyone to be aware that I'm NOT posting pics to hurt anyone, nor make them relive any abuse they've been through!' Brower wrote.

'I am posting them to make people (especially women) aware of domestic abuse!

'To let them know this is NOT OK & it's also NOT THEIR FAULT!

'The abuse only gets worse EVERYTIME it reoccurs! Ladies, you may not always be able to walk away the next time!

'I want EVERYONE of you to know if you need someone to talk to about anything I would love to talk with you!

'I Love all of you & just want to be the example for abused/battered women!'

Her ex-husband is standing by her through the abusive former relationship.

'She is lucky to be alive,' Jason Brower told WREG. 'She finally came to the realization that it’s time for women to start standing up and not being scared.'.

Brower said she feels she could understand the situations many women found themselves in.

She regretfully took her boyfriend back after he hit her the first time.

But she's making sure the second time will definitely be the last.

Brower said she wrongly accepted her ex back into her life after he hit her the first time, and said that it is a mistake many women make. She is trying to help other victims

'I made a mistake and I took him back, and everything was OK for a little while,' she told The Huffington Post.

'If you have never been there, you can’t understand why people go back.

'Women follow their heart, they love them, they want to believe them when they say they will change, they lose their friends and family and don’t feel like they have anyone.'

Doctors have placed a metal ring around her eye to stop it from collapsing, according to her posts.

Late last month, Angela Brower underwent surgery to remove bone fragments from her face and to place a metal ring around her eye to stop it from collapsing

Healing: Doctors say it will take two to three months for Brower to be fully recovered

'This isn't Love, nor is it how you show your Love for anyone!!!! No one deserves this!!!' Brower posted on her Facebook

Graphic: Brower posted this photo to show how much blood had come out of her eye, which was seriously injured in the attack

'I have health insurance, but it only covers half the costs,' she continued.

'I don’t want to lose everything I have because I fell in love with the wrong person.'

Brower is trying to raise money to cover her medical bills on GoFundMe.
