Victor Razumov Jr., who stands accused of murder, gouged out both of his eyes in prison in December

A man accused of murdering an elderly widow in her home during a robbery has gouged out both of his eyes in separate incidents in prison, it has emerged.

Victor Razumov Jr.'s horrific injuries were revealed as it emerged he will receive a competency hearing due to the two incidents in New Jersey State Prison in Trenton last December.

'He was transported to Trenton State Prison where he apparently, according to the guards, put his own eye out and was brought to Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia,' his attorney Robert Baer told the New Jersey Herald. 

'Then he was brought back to Trenton State Prison and the next thing you know, he was back in the hospital and they're having to take his other eye out. Now he is completely blind.'

It is not clear how Razumov gouged out his eyes. Baer said he is still waiting for further information as to what exactly happened.

He will now undergo a hearing to determine if he's fit to stand trial, NJ.com reported. A status conference on the case is scheduled for May 30, his attorney said.

Razumov was 18 when he was charged with murder for allegedly stabbing Virginia 'Suzy' Sommer, 73, to death during a robbery at her Wantage home in November 2012.

Police tracked him down several days later after they found some of her stolen jewelry at local pawn shops.

Among his multiple charges, he faces counts of stealing jewelry, selling stolen jewelry and tampering with a probation receipt by eating it, the New Jersey Herald reported.

Razumov was a senior at High Point Regional High School at the time.

His older brother, Alexey Razumov, was also charged in the crime after allegedly driving his younger brother to the pawn shops. He was charged with third-degree conspiring to deal in stolen property and third-degree conspiring to receive stolen property.

After Victor Razumov was arrested, he was transferred to a state psychiatric hospital and placed under suicide watch, authorities said. It is not clear if he remained under suicide watch at the time of the eye-gouging incidents.

Sommer, a retired nurse who lived about half a mile from Razumov, was found by a family friend who had been unable to reach her on the phone. She had been stabbed several times.

Police said there were no signs of forced entry and that nothing was out of place, and only the jewelry appeared to be missing. 

She left behind her three children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her late husband, Bob, had served as mayor of Lafayette.

'She was intelligent and she had a good sense of humor and she'd tell it like it is, you know a hard worker,' her friend Marie Flaumenbaum, 82, told the Sparta Independent after the murder.

'She was a wonderful person. She didn't deserve this.'
