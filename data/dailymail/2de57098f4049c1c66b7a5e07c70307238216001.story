The single supplement has long been the bane of the solo traveller's life.

But now an accommodation website has come up with an unusual solution that allows singletons to save money while seeing the world.

Easynest offers travellers the chance to split the cost of their hotel bill - providing they are prepared to share with a total stranger.

Holiday heaven...or hell? Easynest allows you to split the cost of a hotel room by sharing with a stranger

Globetrotters set up a profile on the site, indicating their preferred destination and travel date.

'Hosts' - fellow solo travellers who have already booked a room - can then get in touch to see whether they would like to share.

Users of the site are encouraged to create interesting and colourful profiles in order to ensure a timely response, and must pay the host directly for their share of the room.

According to the website, the service provides 'the opportunity to meet new friends, build your network, create new opportunities, exchange on the city and learn.'

But it would seem that not everyone is convinced, including Mail On Sunday Travel Editor, Frank Barrett.

'The idea of making friends on the internet in the interests of thrift has all the appeal of sharing a shower with Psycho's Norman Bates in order to cut down on the water bill,' he said.

'It would be nice to think that the internet was a friendly community of benevolent people keen to help you out. But we know from experience that it's as likely to be populated with people as mad as a French mini-roundabout.'

Saving: The website could be the difference between having to plump for a tent (left) instead of a luxury hotel

The new trend for sharing hotel rooms is the latest in a line of purse-friendly solutions for travellers.

Couchsurfing, where hosts offer their sofas and spare beds to travellers, has become increasingly popular among younger travellers - and according to Couchsurfing.org, was used by 10.4 million globetrotters last year.

Other popular ways to save cash on accommodation include home swapping, where travellers switch homes for a week, and trips based in hostels, monasteries and even pub gardens.

Home swapping: If your pied-a-terre is in a lovely enough location, there is a whole world of choice out there for you. Sign up to a swapping website such as Home Base Holidays, and they will put you in touch with a traveller willing to trade their home for yours. You pay an upfront fee of around £30 to use the site, but after that, everything except flights and food is free.

Pub camping: Don't expect luxury yurts or private pools - this is camping of the most basic sort. That said, you do get to use all of the pub facilities and you won't have to go far in search of a pie and a pint. UKCampsite.co.uk lists hundreds of pubs which offer camping - many of which are to be found in the UK's most popular holiday spots.

Farm B&Bs: Thanks to increasing competition from abroad and rafts of smothering legislation, many farms have been forced to diversify, with many throwing open their doors to travellers. Farmstay.co.uk lists some of the nicest - all of which cost less than a hotel stay.

A recent study from network operator EE found that Brits would
consider sharing personal, everyday items if it meant it would
save them some money. 

From a study of 1,000 Britons, 12 per cent said they'd be willing to share their toothbrush with a friend or family member, and 62 per cent would share deodrant.

The research also found that 47 per cent of men would share a towel and 33 per cent would even share a razor. 

Of the female population, 44 per cent would be happy to
share their hairbrush, and over half, 53 per cent, said they’d willingly share
make-up if it meant they could conserve some cash.

On average, women in the UK
could save over £200 a year if they shared clothes, beauty products and
toiletries with friends and family, according to EE.
