A man with a realistic-looking tattoo of a gun on his stomach had the real thing tucked into his waistband when he was arrested, police said.

Police told said that 41-year-old Michael Smith, of Norridgewock, showed up at a sheriff's deputy's home Thursday night. He was crying and had been drinking, authorities said.

Smith told police he had a fight with his ex-girlfriend and had stolen prescription narcotics from her, authorities said.

Previously: On March 18, Smith awoke to a SWAT team outside his door after his tattoo of a gun tucked into his waistband was mistaken by a tree removal crew for a real gun

He was charged with stealing drugs, and his gun was confiscated. He was released from jail on $1,000 bail. His phone has been disconnected, and he couldn't be reached for comment.

Madison police Officer Eric Bronson said Smith was carrying a .40-caliber Glock but isn't facing any gun charges because Maine is an open-carry state and his weapon was visible.

Smith's next court date is August 6th.

Smith made headlines in March when members of a tree removal crew he'd told to clear off his property reported that he had a gun. But the gun turned out to be his tattoo.

He told the newspaper then that the tattoo had never been a problem before. He wasn't charged in that case.
