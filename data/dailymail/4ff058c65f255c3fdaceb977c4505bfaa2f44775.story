Dogs are simple creatures.

But this 14-year-old poodle is more cultured than most people.

In just four years, Cerbero has jetted to 10 countries for art exhibitions.

And he has become an internet sensation. 

Globetrotter: Cerbero (pictured on his first plane) has spent four years scaling the art capitals of the world

Bright lights: The 14-year-old poodle has jetted from Lima to places including Las Vegas, Nevada

Big spender: He made a stop off in Caesar's Palace for an evening between their more cultured activities

The globetrotting poodle has visited France, Spain, Slovenia, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Brussels, the United States, Mexico, and Peru.

He was bought by proud owner Ety Fefer, 41, from a pet shop in Lima 14 years ago.

But the artist, who funds their trips by making and selling mechanical sculptures at exhibitions around the world, never expected her four-legged friend to become her long term travel companion.

She said: 'I travel a lot with my exhibition so I had to leave him behind for a long time in Lima with my mother.

'I always dreamt of taking Cerbero with me on my travels one day but I thought it would really difficult and complicated. 

Travel companion: His owner Ety Fefer, 41, funds the trips by selling sculptures at exhibitions around the world

Fellow star: Internet sensation Cerbero was kind enough to share his spotlight with David Bowie in Hollywood

The big guns: He looked completely un-fussed perched in front of this menacing graffiti art in California

Do the can can: With bouffant hair and a zipped-up jacket, Cerbero looks ready for a night on the razz in Paris

Parisian chic: But the next day he and Ety relaxed in the sunshine at a cafe before jetting back home

'He stayed in Lima and was very sad in my absence, sleeping on the couch, waiting days or months till my return. 

'It was very sad for both of us, so three years ago I decided I couldn't leave him anymore.

'It was then that everything suddenly dawned on me, why was I not taking him on my travels with me.

'The certificates, vaccines, blood tests and passport were the easy part. 

The ultimate silver screen: The pair made a fleeting visit to Cannes to experience the alternative film capital 

A true holiday: A jaunt in Saturnia, Italy, allowed Cerbero do have a well-earned breaked relaxing in a pool

Euro trip: The culture capitals of western Europe - Barcelona (left) and Berlin (right) - also welcomed the dog

Cheers! Unfortunately, Cerbero couldn't join in on the real fun to be had at a beer garden in Dusseldorf

Spain (Madrid, Barcelona, Tudela)

Switzerland (Geneva)

Italy (Milan, Venice, Florence, Torino, Rome)

France (Paris, Lille, Cannes)

Belgium (Brussels)

USA (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco)

Slovenia (Piran)

Germany (Berlin, Dusseldorf)

Mexico (Mexico City, Oaxaca, Merida, Playa del Carmen, Tulum) 

Peru (more than 10 cities)

'We had our first trip from Lima to Madrid. It was a twelve-hour direct flight and he behaved very well.

'I truly believe that our partnership was meant to be.' 

When Ety first bought Cerbero as a puppy, she was warned by a vet that he was weary and he should have a calm lifestyle.

But after being treated for a cough, he was bounding around excitedly.

Since then, he has had a wonderous lifestyle exploring the world's art capitals.

Ety, who documents every trip on her blog Cerbero On The Road, takes pictures of her pet at every opportunity.

From soaking in the bright lights of downtown New York to sipping on a beer in Germany, Cerbero, who sometimes has to hide in a specially made bag when passing through 'dog un-friendly' countries, is a constant on Ety's travels.

She said: 'Travelling is so much more fun when it's with Cerbero.

'Many countries are very nice with dogs, but some countries, like Mexico, just don't accept them anywhere; so we have to hide him.

La vida mexicana: He looks like he wants time to chill out on the white sand beach and a hammock in Mexico

Roll up, roll up! Street vendors in Mexico were given a run for their money when Cerbero decided to try his hand

Statesmanlike: He had been told he was too weary to travel. But Cerbero looks content sat in Geneva

On top of the world: He's getting on, but Cerbero (pictured in San Francisco) is still raring to go, Ety says

'Italy is our favourite place, people are in love with dogs there and he can go anywhere he likes.

'But he is old and gets tired of walking fast, so now that I have a son, they share the stroller.

'I take pictures of him all the time, but it is spontaneous because he hates posing, they just come naturally.'
