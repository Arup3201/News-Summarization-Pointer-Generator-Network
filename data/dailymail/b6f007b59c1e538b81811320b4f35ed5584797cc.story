Claim: Experienced teacher Perena Polius-Curran took Basildon Academies to a tribunal after the job she wanted went to a newly-qualified candidate

An experienced maths teacher has won her claim for racial discrimination - after the job she wanted went to a newly-qualified candidate.

Perena Polius-Curran, 42, of Eaton Socon, Cambridgeshire - who is of Black Caribbean origin - took Basildon Academies in Pitsea, Essex, to an employment tribunal.

She claimed the school had failed to interview her properly for a head of department role - despite her 10 years’ experience - and instead gave the job to a newly-qualified teacher.

Judge Julia Jones upheld her discrimination claim, and found Mrs Polius-Curran was treated unfairly ‘not because of her lack of qualifications or lack of ability, but the difference in her race.’

Mrs Polius-Curran said: ‘I’m very pleased with the judgement, but sitting though the hearing and reading the verdict has bought it all back.

‘I’m not sure I will ever teach again, and it’s made me think what I’m going to do with my life. It was an awful experience, and one which I’m terrified of going through again.’

The hearing, which took place at East London Tribunal Hearing Centre in Poplar, heard Mrs Polius-Curran first applied for a job at the Basildon Upper Academy through an agency at the end of 2011.

She stated she wanted a more senior role and was particularly interested in the head of maths vacancy, but went on to accept a job as a £40,000-a-year teacher in April 2012.

Bosses at the Basildon Academies felt she was unsuitable for a management role because she had taken a five-year break to have a child, but failed to give her any formal feedback.

The senior team also promised to give her training to become an advanced skills teacher but later back-tracked on this, saying her performance was not good enough. But it turned out there was no funding available for the role.

Discrimination: A judge found Mrs Polius-Curran was treated unfairly by Basildon Academies in Pitsea, Essex

The tribunal heard the head of department job went to Will Coombs, a newly-qualified teacher of white British origin, who did not have to go through the formal application procedure.

Another junior teacher, whom Mrs Polius-Curran had helped mentor, went on to become deputy head of department. She handed in her notice at the end of February 2013, and left the next month.

Judge Jones said: ‘It is our judgement that Mr Coombs was appointed without interview, without any objective assessment of his suitability for this post and without responding to an advert.

‘Mr Coombs was effectively “tapped on the shoulder” and invited to apply. This is totally different from the claimant’s situation where her agency had put her CV forward and asked that she be considered for the post.’

The judge stated that because of these differences, 'we can infer less favourable treatment on the grounds of race'.

Claim: Mrs Polius-Curran first applied for a job at the Basildon Upper Academy through an agency in 2011

Mrs Polius-Curra - who gave up a job at Westcliff High School for Boys, a grammar school 12 miles away in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, to join the Upper Academy - is set to be awarded compensation, but a date has not yet been scheduled for a further hearing.

Despite being offered jobs at schools in Cambridgeshire, Mrs Polius-Curran has struggled to face work since. Basildon Academies is planning to appeal the decision.

Mrs Polius-Curran, who was born and bred in Dagenham but moved to the Basildon area while working at the Upper Academy, also made a complaint of harassment but this was thrown out.

She felt her bosses failed to support her, and even undermined her in front of a class by failing to help her discipline pupils. During her time at the £50million Basildon Academies, which opened in 2009, it was put in special measures.

This came after an Ofsted report in March 2012 that graded both Academies as 'inadequate' for pupils' achievement, behaviour and safety, the quality of teaching and leadership and management. 

The Academies said in February this year that they had both been taken out of special measures. An Academies spokesman could not immediately comment when contacted by MailOnline today.
