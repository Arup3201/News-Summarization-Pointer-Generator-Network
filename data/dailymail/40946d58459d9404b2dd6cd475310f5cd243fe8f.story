Two sisters have defied the odds after giving birth within minutes of one another in the same hospital.   

Dwynwen Williams had her son Celt only three minutes after Iola Roberts gave birth to her daughter Mirain on February 19.

Midwives gave the sisters, who live in Wales, beds side by side to each other in the same ward at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital, after the births.

The sisters, who were both overdue, had booked to be induced on separate dates but astonishingly both went into labour on February 19 this year 

Dwynwen, 38, and Iola, 39, who both already had two children each, were thrilled to fall pregnant at the same time last year.

Neither sister knew the other was pregnant, and the announcements were a huge surprise. They went through ante-natal appointments together, also at the same hospital.

Iola, who lives in Nebo, North Wales, with husband Paul and their older children Brenig, six, and Brillaen, three, was given February 9 as a due date. 

While Dwynwen, who lives in Llangernyw, North Wales, with husband Dewi, a farmer, and their older children Mabon, seven and Llywarch, five, was due on February 13.

Older sister Iola, who works as a nurse, said that despite their due dates being so close they had never expected to go into labour at the same time.

She said: 'Everyone kept joking we might have the babies on the same day but I didn't think it was possible.

'Both of my sons were born early so I expected this one to be the same.'

But both babies were overdue and the sisters were booked in to be induced three days apart. However, both sisters went into labour before their appointments came.

Dwynwen, 38, said: 'When I was on my way to hospital, I texted Iola to say what was happening, and I couldn't believe it when she sent one back to say she was also on her way.' 

Iola, who arrived at the hospital shortly after Dwynwen, added: 'When I arrived at the hospital, I was told I'd have to wait because there was someone in the treatment room being examined, and I replied: "Tell her to get a move on!"

'The midwife was shocked until she realised it was my sister.'

The sisters were allowed on a ward together in the early stages of labour. They then gave birth in adjacent rooms, within three minutes of each other.

Dwynwen said that having her sister there made the experience even more special.  

'It was just so nice to have Iola around. It turned out she gave birth to Mirain at 1.11am, and I gave birth to Celt at 1.14am.'

Iola agreed: 'It was like a family reunion on the ward. It was lovely having my sister next to me.'

The mums were then given beds side by side in a maternity ward.

After giving birth both of the sisters were kept on the same ward before travelling home the next day. Iona is pictured here at home with her two elder sons and baby daughter Mirain 

Iola says that the amazing coincidence attracted a lot of attention from the staff in the hospital.  

'The midwives couldn't believe what was going on. They said they'd never come across anything like it before, and people were taking photographs as the babies looked so similar and were almost the same weight.'

Dwynwen's son, Celt, had a suspected heart murmur so they stayed in hospital for an extra night. But the next day he was given the all-clear and allowed home.

The sisters are enjoying bringing up their babies together and hope they will grow up to be as close as they are.

They are both also supporting a campaign to keep doctor-led maternity services at the hospital where the two cousins were born.

The consultant-led unit is currently under threat of downgrade, but without it, the sisters say their story might not have been such a happy one.

Dwynwen said: 'I needed a consultant with me all through the birth because of complications. If I hadn't been able to go to Glan Clywd I would have faced a much longer journey to hospital, meaning my baby could have been danger.

'People like me, living in rural areas, rely on Glan Clywd as a lifeline.'

Both sisters are now backing a national campaign in Wales to keep doctor-led maternity services at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, in North Wales, where their babies were born.
