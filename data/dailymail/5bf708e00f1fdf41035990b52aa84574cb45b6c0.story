It's unlikely to win a gold with those who like their Christmas cards 'traditional'.

But as the winter chill bites, David and Samantha Cameron's seasonal greetings remind us that there were a few days of sunshine this year.

The Prime Minister and his wife are photographed on a bright July day waving from Number 10 as they welcome the Olympic flame to Downing Street on the eve of the London Games.

The PM tweeted a picture of himself signing the cards, saying it was a 'lengthy task!'

The flame is carried by war hero Kate Nesbitt, whose treatment of wounded troops while under fire in Afghanistan won her the Military Cross to be awarded to a woman in the Royal Navy.

Aides will hope the card will act as a reminder of the amazing summer of sport - and the mood of optimism it created.

Today he tweeted a picture of himself 
signing the cards on the way to visit businesses in the West Midlands. 
He wrote: 'Nearly finished signing my Christmas cards, a lengthy task!'

The PM is a fan of summery shots in Downing Street - last year he opted for a similar photo from a Royal Wedding street party.

Assuming one of his cards gets to Nick Clegg, Mr Cameron can expect to receive a more festive one in return. The Deputy Prime Minister’s cards this year feature a Santa and a grinning snowman in a collage by eight-year-old Caitlin Costello, a patient at Sheffield Children’s Hospital

Ed Miliband’s friends will be treated to a snap of him grinning along with wife Justine and their sons, Daniel, three, and Samuel, two. The picture was taken at their north London home.

Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband both chose images taken by Press Association photographer Stefan Rousseau.

All three party leaders went with traditional Merry Christmas' messages inside their cards.

Aides to Mr Milband revealed the thinking behind the choice of photo.

'Ed's family are at the centre of everything he does and he is looking 
forward to spending time with them this Christmas,' said a party source.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who last year enlisted his own children to draw a picture, has chosen a painting by a young patient at Sheffield Children's Hospital.

Nick Clegg and wife Miriam, who are keen to keep their three children out of the spotlight, again chose not to use a photograph of their family

Eight-year-old Caitlin Costello's 
collage featuring Father Christmas and a snowman won a competition to 
feature on the Lib Dem leader's card.

On the back of the card is the second-placed entry by Cameron Delaney, nine, and information about the work of the hospital.

Mr Clegg said: 'The cards designed by the children were fantastic festive efforts. We were so impressed, we chose two - one for the front and one for the back.

'Sheffield Children's Hospital do amazing work all year round but especially for those children who have to be in hospital over the Christmas period. It's a cause very close to mine and Miriam's heart.'

Last year the Cameron's chose a photo taken on at a street party to celebrate the Royal Wedding held in Downing Street

Since becoming Labour leader Mr Miliband has always chosen family portraits, opting for black and white images in 2011 (left) and 2010 (right)

Last year Mr Clegg enlisted his three sons to draw a family of snowmen for his card

For the last two years Mr Clegg has enlisted his children to design his card. In 2011 the Clegg boys' felt-pen scrawl depicted the family as snowmen, each offering their best wishes for the festive season.

Those wishes were 'happiness' from Mr Clegg, 'peace' from wife Miriam, 'fun and no homework' from Antonio, 'cakes and sweets' from Alberto and 'lots of presents' from two-year-old Miguel.

A year earlier the Cleggs were shown as gingerbread men, but raised eyebrows because the sons showed their father on the mobile - suggesting he often had to take calls since becoming Deputy PM.

It later emerged Miriam insisted the boys added the phone. Mr Clegg admitted: 'She says I spend far too much time on the blower.'
