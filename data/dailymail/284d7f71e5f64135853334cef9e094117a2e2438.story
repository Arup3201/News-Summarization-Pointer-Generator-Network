Devon Still shared some amazing news about his daughter Leah on Tuesday.

The Cincinnati Bengals star wrote that 4-year-old Leah, who has been bravely battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma for the past year, may finally be free of the disease.

'That moment you get the best news you've ever received and don't know what to do so you just flex!!' wrote Still on his Instagram page. 

'We got Leah's MIBG Scans back tonight and the doctors told us they didn't see any active disease in her body!!!'

Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease

Still shared the news of his Twitter and Instagram

He went on to say; 'We still have to wait for her MRI and bone biopsy results later this week. But the doctors feel very optimistic about them because of the results from today. So for now we celebrate!!'

Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy.

She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research.

In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment.

The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance

Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys.

The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play.

The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. 

And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage.
