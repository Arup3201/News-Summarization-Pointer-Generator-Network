There have been a lot of attempts to win the title of cheesiest 2015 calender. 

But with six weeks still to go until January 1, a group of French women have swooped in and stolen the crown. 

All it took was... well, some lumps of actual cheese.

It's 10th birthday of the Calendrier des From Girls (Cheese Girls calendar). Every month has a scantily clad woman posing with a piece of cheese

The Calendrier des From Girls (Cheese Girls calendar) is celebrating a decade of existence this year, with their 2015 offering marking ten years since the first was published. 

Every month features a scantily-clad woman posing in a suggestive manner with a piece of cheese. 

The dairy products range from goats cheese to Camembert and are featured on the month when they are traditionally produced the most.

The calendar costs €19 (£15.18) plus postage and packing, with proceeds going to L'Association Fromages de Terroirs (The Association Of Regional Cheeses). 

The month of June features the Mothais goat cheese, which was was first made in the Deux-Sevres region, where it is still produced on the farms

The month of July features Banon AOP - an unpasterised goat cheese made in the region around the town of Banon in Provence, south-east France 

The association fights the cause of unpasteurised cheeses, as the numbers of people eating them have diminished greatly in France in recent years. 

The calendar is the brainchild of Véronique Richez-Lerouge, who also founded the organisation and the country's National Cheese Day. 

The website reads: 'The profits of sales are completely put back to the Association which militates for 12 years for the unpasteurised milk cheeses and their preservation in the French heritage.'

Camembert is the star cheese for March. It is is Normandy's most famous cheese, which takes its name from the village near Vimoutiers, in the Orne region

Mimolette is a cheese traditionally produced around the city of Lille, France. Cheese mites are intentionally used on the outside of the cheese to create extra flavour - this process led o the US banning the product

The website continues: 'Your contribution is precious to help us to follow our fight against the standardization. 

'Farmers and producers continue to make some cheese in the respect for the product and for the values. 

'Those need your support and there is only you, as consumer, who can act.' 

Neufchâtel is the cheese for February. It is one of the oldest cheeses in France and is thought to date back to the 6th century

The calendar costs €19 (£15.18) plus postage and packing, with proceeds going to L'Association Fromages de Terroirs (The Association Of Regional Cheeses)
