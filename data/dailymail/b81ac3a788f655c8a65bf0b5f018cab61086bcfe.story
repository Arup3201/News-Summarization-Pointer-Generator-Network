First thing in the morning, many of us need a quick stretch to ease ourselves into the day.

But Nicola Whitehill’s daily routine is a little more complicated. She needs three hours of bathing in oil and slathering moisturiser on her skin to unlock her stiffened limbs.

Miss Whitehill, 40, has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), meaning her skin and blood vessels harden and restrict her movement.

Nicola Whitehill, 40, suffers from both Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), meaning her skin and blood vessels harden and restrict her movement

Ms Whitehill says that when she wakes up she is 'like the Tin Man' and that her skin feels very stiff and as thought it is made of leather

Ms Whitehill must also wear gloves constantly as 
simply putting her hand into the fridge can mean her fingers turn blue 
and cause her immense pain. She also wears Ugg boots to keep her toes warm

Raynaud's phenomenon affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body - usually the fingers and toes. It occurs when the blood vessels go into a temporary spasm which blocks the blood flow (pictured)

‘When I wake up I’m like the Tin Man. 
My whole body is stiff and feels like leather,’ she said.   ‘I have to 
bathe in liquid paraffin and then cover myself in cream, otherwise I 
can’t even straighten my arms out in front of me.’

She also has Raynaud’s syndrome, a 
condition in which blood is prevented from reaching the extremities of 
the body, mainly the fingers and toes, when exposed to the cold.

The diseases are linked, with a small proportion of patients suffering from both.

Miss Whitehill, a barrister, was diagnosed in 1997 after several years of feeling unwell and exhausted.

It takes Ms Whitehill three hours to prepare to leave the house as she has to apply so many creams to her skin

She has to bathe in liquid paraffin to soften her skin or she is unable to straighten her arms out in front of her

Ms Whitehill has to go to her local hospital every month and sees her consultant in London twice a year. She works hard to raise awareness of her conditions

Ms Whitehill says that for the first seven years that she had the conditions she did not look after herself properly and that she failed to recognise how serious they are

Scleroderma, an auti-immune condition, results in an overproduction of collagen, which is found in connective tissue.

Scleroderma is a disease that results in the hardening and thickening of areas of skin.

It is an autoimmune condition which means that the body attacks its own tissues causing them to harden.

Systemic scleroderma, as suffered by Ms Whitehill, can also affect the internal organs.

This can cause symptoms such as heartburn and difficulty swallowing.

The condition causes the skin to become thick and puffy which can restrict the movement.

It can also cause the fingers and toes to swell.

In some cases it causes hair loss, weight loss, fatigue and joint pain.

Treatments include taking steroids and immunosuppressants, physiotherapy and applying creams and moisturisers.

It affects skin, blood vessels, and joints but can sometimes sink into internal organs such as the heart, kidneys and bowel.

Luckily, Miss Whitehill is not  yet 
affected to this extent but she does suffer from ulcers, which build up 
on her fingers and toes. Changes in temperature set off her symptoms and
something as simple as a cool breeze or air conditioning can  affect 
her.

‘I live in gloves and Ugg boots, and 
when I leave the house I look like an Eskimo, all year round,’ she said 
at her home in Southport, Merseyside.

‘I can’t walk in proper shoes any more, but I have to be thankful for the things I do have.’

The severity of the illness meant  she
had to give up work in 2004  and she now spends as much time as she can
working as a volunteer with the Raynaud’s and Scleroderma Association.

She relishes the chance to help other patients understand the condition, manage it properly and live life to the full.

‘There isn’t enough awareness  out 
there, even among the medical profession – many GPs don’t know anything 
about it,’ she said. ‘I can’t live the life I used to but I have  to 
look at the positives and hope  that one day I will wake up and jump out
of bed.’
