A decomposing body believed to be that of the prime suspect in the murder of teenager Alice Gross was found yesterday less than two miles from where she was discovered – raising fresh questions about the police investigation into her disappearance.

Officers discovered the corpse, thought to be that of Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns, in a West London park they had searched a week ago while looking for the schoolgirl. Zalkalns disappeared a month ago.

A source revealed last night that the body was in an advanced state of decomposition when it was found in dense woodland.

It was also reported that the body had been found hanged.

Police hunting Arnis Zalkalns (left), the prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross (right), have found a body in Boston Manor Park in Brentford, west London - just miles from where Alice's body was discovered

The body was in an advanced state of decomposition when it was found in dense woodland in the London park

The discovery raises the prospect that the bodies of both the 41-year-old and his 14-year-old alleged victim had remained undiscovered for several weeks in the very area where the Metropolitan 

Police had been carrying out its biggest search operation since the 7/7 terrorist attacks on London. 

A local resident confirmed last night that police had searched Boston Manor Park a week earlier. She suggested Zalkalns could have been living there with Eastern Europeans who use it as a makeshift campsite.

The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘When I spoke to one of the policemen, he said they were looking for evidence in connection with Alice. 

'I asked him whether they had looked into the campsite which is in the dense wooded area because I’ve seen a lot of Eastern European people camping out there.

‘I think [Zalkalns] could have been living rough there. If the police had searched that area sooner they might have found him alive.’

Police deployed officers and a forensics team to Boston Manor Park following the discovery of a man's body

It can also be revealed that officers had not informed Zalkalns’s girlfriend by the time news of the body’s discovery was announced on Saturday afternoon.

Told by The Mail on Sunday that the search team had found a man, Zalkalns’s partner Katerina Laiblova asked: ‘Has he been found in a good way or a bad way?’

On learning that the man found was dead, Czech-born Ms Laiblova said: ‘I hope he is innocent. I wish I could get drunk or be distressed but I can’t because I have Linda [their one-year-old daughter] to look after. He was a very good father.’

Although the body was discovered at 2pm yesterday, it will not be recovered until today because police need ‘specialist resources’.

Alice vanished on August 28 after leaving her family home in Hanwell at lunchtime and telling her mother she would be back that evening.

Scotland Yard confirmed the body of a man had been found in 'dense woodland' in the park this afternoon

Over the following days, her family made emotional appeals for her to return.

A week after her disappearance the police investigation was taken over by a homicide team, and in the following days her rucksack was found, containing her shoes.

Zalkalns, who lived with his girlfriend and their baby in Ealing, was reported missing on September 4.

It was only on September 16, three weeks after the schoolgirl’s disappearance, that police announced they were searching for the labourer in relation to the case.

Analysis of CCTV images showed Zalkalns cycling just 15 minutes behind Alice on the day that she went missing.

Detectives also discovered that Zalkalns murdered his first wife Rudite in Latvia in 1997, for which he served seven years, and was arrested for indecently assaulting a teenage girl after arriving in Britain a decade later.

Zalkalns, 41, has not been seen since September 3 - a week after 14-year-old Alice disappeared on August 28

David Cameron has said he will examine 'all the circumstances of the case' surrounding Alice's murder

Last Tuesday officers discovered Alice’s body on a stretch of the River Brent that had previously been searched, and yards from where her belongings were discovered four weeks earlier.

A post mortem has proved inconclusive, possibly because of the delay in finding the body, and further tests are being carried out to establish the cause of death.

Yesterday Boston Manor Park was sealed off while teams in forensics suits looked for evidence.

The developments came after David Cameron pledged to personally examine how Zalkalns managed to gain entry into Britain in 2007.
