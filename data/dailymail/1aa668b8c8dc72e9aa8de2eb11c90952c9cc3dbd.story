Most pubs are used to disturbances on their premises, but they are usually not of the supernatural kind.

However, staff at one of Britain's oldest pubs believe they have caught a ghost on CCTV - and claim it has smashed a glass on the floor.

The spooky intruder was spotted floating by the bar at the 763-year-old Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Bolton, Manchester.

A ghost? This spooky figure was caught on CCTV at Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Bolton, Manchester. It is believed to have smashed a glass on the floor of the premises, which is one of the oldest pubs in Britain

Manager Tony Dooley discovered the spectre after heading downstairs on Friday morning and stumbling upon a broken glass lying on the floor.

Thinking he had been burgled, he rushed to check CCTV footage - only to discover the figure flickering mysteriously by the bar.

The recording then shut off - for no apparent reason - at 6.18am.

'I came down and saw a glass smashed on the floor so I was instantly suspicious and went to check the CCTV and found it has stopped working,' said Mr Dooley. 'We checked the footage and it revealed this figure.

'To be honest I was a bit concerned - I’m a bit of a sceptic when it comes to ghosts but you become more of a believer when you see things like that.'

The pub, which dates from 1251, is the fourth-oldest pub in Britain and is reportedly haunted by the ghost of James Stanley, the seventh Earl of Derby.

The royalist, whose family originally owned the inn, is believed to have spent the last hours of his life there before he was beheaded in 1651 toward the end of the Civil War.

The chair he sat in before he was executed is still in the pub today - leading some to believe his spirit also remains on the premises.

Hundreds of soldiers and civilians were also killed outside the pub during the Bolton Massacre in 1644.

With such a bloody history, the premises has long been considered a hotspot for paranormal activity - with a psychics previously finding it to be haunted by at least 25 spirits.

Among these are believed to be s woman who hung herself in the cellar several centuries ago, as well as an eight-year-old girl and a phantom dog.

'There have always been rumours it is haunted and we have had psychic readings done here in the past,' said Mr Dooley.

'Occasionally you hear things and wonder if it is just the building settling down or whether it is something else.

'It is the fourth-oldest pub in Great Britain so it’s had its fair share of deaths and whatnot.'

Mr Dooley added that he hoped his customers would not be put off by the spirits of olde - saying: 'There is a well-known haunt in Bolton and people are quite receptive of it.

'But you can’t help but get all spooked out when you see something like this. It can make your hairs stand on end.'
