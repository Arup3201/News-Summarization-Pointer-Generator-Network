Addictive: A fixed-odd machine in a bookmakers. Payouts from them are to be capped for three years under plans to clamp down on 'Wild West' betting practices

Slot machines dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of the  gambling world are to have their payouts capped for three years under plans to clamp down on ‘Wild West’ betting practices.

The Mail has learned that a government review will  conclude that until at least 2016 bookmakers cannot put up the stakes or the prizes on fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), where punters can place bets of  up to £100 a turn.

High street bookies have also been told to draw up a code of  conduct for the casino-style machines which will allow customers to set a limit on how much they are prepared to lose.

The machines, which feature games such as roulette, blackjack and poker and have a maximum payout of £500 – have been blamed for a spate of problem gambling as it is possible to lose hundreds of pounds in just a few minutes. They have become so popular that the profits from the machines now account for around half of all income for high street bookmakers.

Under the plans, customers will be able to set their limit when they start betting and receive running updates about how much they have lost in order to discourage them from losing money that they cannot afford.

At the same time, Culture Secretary Maria Miller will also bring forward plans to crack down on the world of online betting.

Legislation will be introduced when MPs return to Westminster next month to ensure that every gambling website which has UK customers has to have a British betting licence.

Thanks to rules introduced  by Labour, online gambling is lightly regulated, and high street firms such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral run their websites offshore, leaving them immune from control.

Government officials say that requiring all online operators which work or advertise in the UK to have a British licence will ensure they participate in tackling corruption in sports, provide funding to combat problem gambling and ensure adequate protection of children and vulnerable adults.

The Treasury is also set to introduce rules at a later date to ensure that online gambling operators are forced to pay tax on their activities in the UK. Government officials claimed that Mrs Miller had been privately lobbied by gambling companies to increase the number of FOBTs in their premises and the prizes they pay out.

A senior source said: ‘Last year companies said they wanted more fixed odds terminals, and when they realised that wasn’t going to happen they said they wanted higher stakes and prizes.  They say these terminals are vital for their revenues. There’s been a lot of lobbying.’

However, the Association of British Bookmakers, which represents high street firms, insisted that it had not made a formal demand for higher payouts for the FOBTs, classified as B2 machines.

Spokesman Dirk Vennix said: ‘The ABB has never called for an increase in stakes and prizes on B2 gaming machines, and we believe they should remain as they are now.’

He added: ‘The ABB is launching a new code for responsible gambling and player protection in  betting shops, which will be published soon.’

Mrs Miller has not commented on the results of the review of stakes and prizes since it is not due to be published until next month.

But the Culture Secretary said that she was bringing forward the legislation to control offshore  gambling websites to coincide with the review.

She said: ‘Online gambling companies that operate in Britain and can affect families up and down our country must not remain outside British law.

‘Consumers need to know that this is not the Wild West and rules for gambling apply equally across the board.

‘We will ensure that through our licensing reforms, our online gambling companies take the responsibility they need to, including providing funding to help combat the problem-gambling which can blight lives.

‘There is no reason at all why online gambling taking place in this country should be able to operate outside UK law.’
