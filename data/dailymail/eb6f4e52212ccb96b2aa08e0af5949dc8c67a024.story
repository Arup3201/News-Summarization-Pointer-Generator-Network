'Little daredevil': Edward Rainger, who drowned after falling into his grandparents' swimming pool as he played with his brother

A two-year-old boy drowned after falling into his grandparents’ swimming pool.

Edward ‘Teddie’ Rainger was last seen playing with his four-year-old brother next to the pool in his grandparents’ garden.

Emergency services were called after he was found lying lifeless on the pool bottom in Langdon Hills, Essex. The little boy was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

Yesterday family members paid tribute to Teddie, who had been staying with his grandparents Mark and Deborah Rainger at their £600,000 detached home.

His aunt Kirsty Rainger, 26, wrote a message on Facebook saying: ‘This is breaking our hearts … it’s a cruel world.’ She added: ‘My gorgeous brave Teddie. I can’t believe this has happened.

‘You will always be in my heart and not a second will go by where I don’t think of you and miss you. You’re such a clever funny boy. A little daredevil and a little fighter. Life itself will never be the same. You’ll be the brightest star shining down on your big brother, mummy and daddy.

‘This is so heartbreaking. Sleep tight and keep smiling, we know you’ll always be with us.’

His 22-year-old aunt Roxy Rainger also posted online, saying: ‘I just want him back.’

An inquest was formally opened at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court yesterday following the tragedy on Tuesday last week.

During the brief hearing, the court heard how the boy was seen playing shortly before he was found under the water.

Coroner’s officer, Alan Adkin, said: ‘Teddie Rainger and his four-year-old brother were last seen playing on the decking. He was later found at the bottom of the swimming pool.’

Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray offered her condolences to the family, who were not present, before adjourning the inquest. A police investigation into the death is now under way, although a spokesman confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances.

The family were contacted at their home yesterday, but chose not to comment.

Tragedy: The two-year-old boy was rushed to Basildon Hospital, pictured, in Essex, where he was pronounced dead

 A 16-year-old boy drowned 30ft from 
the shore on a family holiday to France – moments after his father 
suggested that they head back to the beach. Kevin Knight, 48, saw his 
son Kieran disappear off the coast of Messanges in south-west France. 
Kieran, from Newhall, Derbyshire, was dragged away by a strong 
undercurrent.

His body was recovered from the water on Saturday – three days after he went missing.

Warning of the dangers of swimming in 
the sea, Mr Knight said: ‘We were no more than ten metres away from the 
shoreline when I felt we should come out of the sea.

‘I looked back and Kieran was gone. He was two metres away but the undertow was different.

‘We were not in deep. We both had our 
feet on the ground. People need to be aware that the danger can be right
there at the water’s edge.’
