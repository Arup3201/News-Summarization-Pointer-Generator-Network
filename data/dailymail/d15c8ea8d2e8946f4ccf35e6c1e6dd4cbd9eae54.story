A gun fan shows everyone how to open a beer - by shooting off its lid using a shotgun.

The dangerous stunt, uploaded onto YouTube, shows a Swedish hunter holding a bottle of Carlsberg at arms length before blowing the cap off with his gun.

He then hold the undamaged glass bottle to the camera and takes a swig of his freshly opened beer.

Undamaged: After shooting the lid off, the Swedish hunter holds the glass bottle to the camera and takes a swig of his freshly opened beer

While the most adventurous many of us get when opening a bottle of beer is using a lighter or perhaps our teeth, the hunter thinks nothing of taking things to a dramatic new level.

The short clip, uploaded by Anders Rodenberg, has already attracted over 13,000 views.

Some commenters have branded the gunman stupid, while others appear to admire his eccentric methods of consuming alcohol.Â

While some Youtube commenters thought the gunman behaved recklessly, others appeared to admire his eccentric methods of consuming alcohol. One user branded him 'stupid but also mildly impressive'

Other users pointed out the man could easily have blow his fingers off, while another accused him of needlessly wasting bullets.

In
 the clip the man lowers the barrel of his gun to meet the top of a 
bottle of beer, pulls the trigger and blows the lid clean off.

Other than a slight trickle of foam, the beer and glass bottle appear to be totally unaffected by their close encounter with a shotgun.
