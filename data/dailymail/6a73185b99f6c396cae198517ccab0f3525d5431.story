Following reports last week Amazon is working on gaming and entertainment device, the retail giant has fuelled these rumours by acquiring video studio Double Helix Games.

Amazon already has its own studio, developing games for iOS and Android gadgets, and this acquisition suggests the firm is looking to expand this part of the business further.

TechCrunch discovered leaked details about the acquisition earlier this week and Amazon has since confirmed it bought the company as part of its 'ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers.'

Double Helix Games was set up in 2007 following a merger between studios, The Collective and Shiny Entertainment.  

Previous to that the firms had been respectively building games since the mid-1990s.

Recent titles produced by Double Helix Games include G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and Silent Hill: Homecoming.

The firm is based in Irvine, California and employs 75 people.

Rumours about an impending games console were reported last week by gaming blog VG24/7.

The 'gaming and entertainment device' is set to cost $300 (£180) and will run on Android. It is expected to go on sale later this year.

Any games console Amazon makes will directly compete with the likes of Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.

The company is also starting from an established base of more than 200 million customers, and already has a strong software base, with its Amazon store, alongside hardware such as the Kindle e-reader, and the Kindle range of tablets.

After selling games on its App Store, Amazon decided to set up its own studio called Amazon Games Studios in 2012.

It
 launched a Facebook game called Living Classics, which was pulled from 
the site in October last year. Current games include flying game Air 
Patriots, available for Apple and Android devices.

If
 Amazon doesn't launch a console, it could be looking to use Double 
Helix's expertise to enhance the successes of this studio.
