A North Carolina man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six to 10 years in prison on Wednesday for handcuffing an 11-year-old boy by his ankle to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as punishment.

Former Emergency Room nurse Dorian Harper entered the plea to three felonies, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and maiming without malice. His plea came a day after a jury was seated in the case.

'Yes, sir,' Harper, 58, said when the trial judge asked if he was guilty.

Harper rejected prosecutors' plea deal Monday, saying he wanted the trial to go on. 

He and his girlfriend, 58-year-old Wanda Larson, were arrested after a sheriff's deputy found the boy in November 2013.

'This is a very serious case, with very serious implications for Mr. Harper,' Judge Brad Long told the jury Tuesday.

Larson was the boy's guardian and a Department of Social Services supervisor in Union County. 

Larson faces similar charges. 

She has pleaded not guilty.

Authorities said they think Harper tied the dead chicken around the boy's neck as punishment for killing one of the chickens on the 5-acre farm where they lived.

The indictment against the couple said the boy had been subject to abuse that also included being chained to a piece of railroad track in his room. 

Harper cut the boy's face with a knife and used an electric wire to burn his face, according to the indictment. 

The chicken: Dorian Harper is guilty of chaining his 11-year-old foster son to the porch with this chicken tied around his neck as a punishment 

It also said the boy once broke his wrist trying to escape.

Four other children — ages 7 to 14, all adopted by Larson — were removed from the home after Harper and Larson were arrested. They also had one 20-year-old adopted son. 

After his arrest,  Harper  lost his job as an emergency room nurse and Larson lost her county job working for social services. 

After the incident in the 2013, the 20-year-old, who didn't want to be named, said his adopted parents Wanda Larson and Dorian Harper provided a 'loving and caring home' but the boy has severe psychological issues, including a history of being cruel to animals.

He said his parents' punishment, though he didn't condone it, was a last ditch attempt to control the child's behavior and protect the rest of the household. 

Everyone says this is some sweet innocent kid when in actuality, he is not. He has been to counseling, he is on numerous heavy medications, but nothing has worked,' the brother told KHOU in 2013.

The brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to 'shame the child.' 

'There has to be something going on, between that child and that chicken,' he said. 'He either, one, didn't feed it and it died, or two, either he was out there harassing the chicken. He may have killed the chicken. This child has been known to be cruel to animals.'

He said the controversial discipline was his father's doing, as his mother, who would have put a stop to it, wasn't home at the time.

The brother explained the 11-year-old, who had lived at the home since he was six, was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem, not because he was being mistreated.

'He would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer, let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw,' the man, who moved out of the home two years ago, when he turned 18, told KHOU.

The home: Police and neighbors described the family's home as being covered in feces with such a pungent smell it 'takes your breath away' 

'He has severe psychological issues.'

'He was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then, throw the lunch box away and say he didn't have lunch for the day.'

Union County Sheriff deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment. But the brother insisted his parents cared for the children.

'Everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused, that is not accurate. You ask all four of the children, they will say they lived in a loving and caring home,' he said.

The account contradicts claims from the 11-year-old's relatives who say they have tried for years to get DSS to look into the allegations of abuse.

Union County Sheriff Animal Services were at the house early this week gathering the property's remaining animals, including an estimated 75 fowl (chicken, ducks, guineas and peacock) three horses, three donkeys, two llamas, eight dogs and a hog.

It was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away.

Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'. 

 Disturbing: Larson, a former child services worker, lived at this property with four adopted children and the 11-year-old who was the only foster child

Another neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'.

'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn't know where he lived,' she said.

The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich. 

'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said.

He told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.'

Her daughter called 911 and a sheriff's deputy came out, spoke with the boy, made a phone call, then told him she'd take him home.

'He didn't refuse. He just went with her.'

The neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn't been missing more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home.

'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.'

Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'.

'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,' he said.

Chance finding: Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to this porch

'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.'

All the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza. 

Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch.

He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch.

According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. 

By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house.

Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened.

'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'
