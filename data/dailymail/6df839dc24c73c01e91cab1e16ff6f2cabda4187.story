Roma have insisted that midfielder Kevin Strootman is not for sale.

The 24-year-old Dutchman, who has been linked with a potential January move to Manchester United, is currently out of action after suffering a serious knee injury in March.

And the Italian club are adamant that he will not be going anywhere when he makes his return.

Roma general manager Mauro Baldissoni told Sky Italia: ‘We can’t wait until Kevin is back on the pitch.

‘We miss him a lot, but he is getting closer to his return. We are proud that Kevin is part of our squad and he is not for sale.’

Strootman had been a big part of Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal's plans when he was in charge of Holland, but the knee injury kept him out of the Dutchman's squad for the World Cup.

However, Van Gaal is still said to be extremely interested in signing the midfielder, with Juan Mata touted as a possible makeweight in any potential deal.
