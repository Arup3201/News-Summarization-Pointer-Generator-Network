Sarah Ferguson has proclaimed that Princess Diana would have been the 'naughtiest' grandmother had she lived to meet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s one-year-old son Prince George.

During an appearance on The Meredith Vieira Show on Wednesday, the Duchess of York said: '[Diana] would have just been the naughtiest, funniest and the best ever just because she loved her boys so much and she would be so proud of all of them and what they've achieved.'

The 55-year-old, whose former husband Prince Andrew is the younger brother of Prince Charles, also praised Charles and Diana's two sons, William and Harry, and William's wife Kate Middleton.

'They really are extraordinary boys and Catherine is incredible. I just think it is all goodness and we need to hear more about goodness and Diana would have loved that,' she said.

While the Duchess could not confirm rumors that William and Kate plan to name their second child after Princess Diana, who died in 1997, she had plenty to say on how the couple are handling life in the spotlight.

'I believe in love. I believe in just that goodness of love and I think they are a beautiful example of a great family, totally in love and with that delicious little George, so squishy, you know you want to eat him,' she said.

She also shot down allegations that her ex-husband had sexual relations with an underage girl; Prince Andrew has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with the minor in question.

Virginia Roberts - now said to be a married mother-of-three in her 30s - alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.

The Duchess defended Prince Andrew, whom she divorced in 1996 after ten years of marriage, telling Ms Vieira: 'Knowing him as I know him, he’s one of the greatest men I've ever met in my life and my best friend and great father to my children.

Picture perfect: 'I think they are a beautiful example of a great family,' Ms Ferguson said of Kate Middleton, George and William

'I don’t understand in this day and age how people could make salacious lies up and how the media can then write about it, and then follow on with it because I just don’t understand. This is defamation of character, of a person that is the opposite of how he’s being portrayed.

'Buckingham Palace put out a denial on his behalf, that’s how it works within the Royal family. They stand by that denial. There is nothing more to be said.'

She made similar statements while on the Today show yesterday, telling Matt Lauer: 'I won't stand by and have his character defamed. My integrity and the American people know my integrity and my integrity is of a great man and I will not have one word said about him on any level. Any level.'
