A $100m pricetag for a three bedroom house may at first glance seem a little over the top... until you realise it is situated on its own paradise island complete with private airstrip.

The island of Pumpkin Key lies less than a 50 minute boat ride from Miami, Florida, and is a ten minute helicopter flight to the city's South Beach.

The island's private marina also offers potential buyers the space to park up to 20 boats - or at least one mega yacht.

Exclusive: The $100m Pumpkin Island is a ten minute helicopter ride from Miami and features its own private airstrip

Living space: The main compound on the 26-acre island features a swimming pool, two caretaker's cottages and a boat captain's apartment

Marina: The island's private marina also offers potential buyers the space to park up to 20 boats

For sale: Russell Post, from Sotherby's International Realty, described Pumpkin Key as 'one of the most exceptional opportunities in real estate today, anywhere in the world'

The main compound on the 26-acre island features a swimming pool, two caretaker's cottages and a boat captain's apartment.

There are also tennis courts which double up as helipads and a huge private beach.

While the property is marketed as a potential family home, the island has planning permission for 12 houses that would overlook the Card Sound Bay in the Florida Keys.

The current family home features just three bedrooms but the island does form a part of the exclusive Ocean Reef community in the U.S.
