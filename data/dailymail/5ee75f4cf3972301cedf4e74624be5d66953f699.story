Former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed has said he was forced to resign yesterday 'at gunpoint' by police and army officers in a coup.

Dozens of demonstrators - including Mr 
Nasheed - were injured today as riot police used tear gas and batons against 
protesters in Republic Square who were demanding that he be reinstated.

Reeko Moosa Manik, a lawmaker and 
chairman of the Maldivian Democratic Party, was beaten unconscious by police and 
hospitalised, according to his son Mudrikath Moosa.

There was no immediate comment from police.

Mr Nasheed, the nation's first democratically elected president, said he was forced to resign at gunpoint Tuesday in what he termed a coup.

He demanded his successor resign and he promised to fight to return to office.

'We will come to power again,' 
Mr Nasheed said. 'We will never step back. I will not accept this coup and 
will bring justice to the Maldivians.'

President
Mohammed Waheed Hassan, the former vice president, took office when Mr 
Nasheed resigned after police joined relentless street protests against 
his government.

Addressing a news conference Wednesday, Mr Hassan denied claims there was a coup or a plot to oust Nasheed.

The former leaders supporters cheered as he arrived for the Maldivian Democratic Party's meeting in Male today, although it later turned more dangerous when Mr Nasheed led an anti-government demonstration and police responded with tear gas

He said he had not prepared to take over the country and he called for the creation of a unity coalition to help it recover.

'Together, I am confident, we'll be able to build a stable and democratic country,' he said, adding that his government intended to respect the rule of law.

Later in the day, he appeared to be consolidating his power by appointing a new military chief and police commissioner.

Mr Nasheed insisted he was pushed from power by the armed forces.

'I was forced to resign with guns all around me. They told me, if I don't resign, they won't hesitate to use arms,' he said.

Speaking to about 2,000 wildly 
cheering members of his MDP in the capital, Male, he called for Hassan's
immediate resignation and demanded the nation's top judge investigate 
those he said were responsible for his ouster.

Mr Nasheed then led an anti-government demonstration. Police responded by firing tear gas.

'If
the police are going to confront us we are going to face them,' Mr Nasheed
told the rally. 'We have to overcome our fear and we have to get 
strength.'

Mr Nasheed's 
supporters began rioting, throwing fire bombs and vandalizing a private 
TV station that had been critical of his government.

Hassan,
who had promised to protect Mr Nasheed from retribution, said his 
predecessor was not under any restriction and was free to leave the 
country. However, he said he would not interfere with any police or 
court action against Mr Nasheed.

Police were investigating the discovery of at least 100 bottles of alcohol inside a truck removing garbage Tuesday from the presidential residence as Mr Nasheed prepared to relinquish power, said police spokesman Ahmed Shyam.

Consuming alcohol outside tourist resorts is a crime in this Muslim nation. If charged and convicted of possession of alcohol, Mr Nasheed could be sent to jail for three years, banished to a distant island, placed under house arrest or fined.

Mr Nasheed presented his resignation in a nationally televised address after police joined demonstrators who had spent weeks protesting his decision to arrest a top judge and then clashed with soldiers in the streets. Some of the soldiers then defected to the police side.

Mr Nasheed's party insisted his ouster was engineered by rogue elements of the police and supporters of the country's former autocratic leader. Others blamed Islamic extremists.Mr Nasheed defended his government.

'I did not want wealth or to continue in the presidency, but I wanted to bring good governance,' he said.

The dueling leaders ran as a ticket in the nation's first multiparty elections in 2008 after Mr Nasheed's MDP formed a coalition with Hassan's Gaumee Itthihaad Party, or National Unity Party.

In a news conference Wednesday, Mr Hassan sought to tamp down fears that Islamists were gaining power.

'They are part of the society; you can't ignore them,' he said. 'But there are wide range of people with different views, philosophies and ideas about politics. I am planning to create a plural multiparty government.'

He also worked to reassure the vital tourism industry that the country, known for its stunning beaches and lavish resorts, remained a peaceful place to visit.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement he hoped Mr Nasheed's resignation would lead to a peaceful resolution of the political crisis.

U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco is scheduled to lead a U.N. team to the country later this week to help the Maldives resolve its political tensions.

Mr Nasheed's resignation marked a stunning fall for the former human rights campaigner who defeated the nation's longtime ruler, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, in the country's first multiparty elections in 2008.

Mr Nasheed was also an environmental celebrity calling for global action to combat the climate change that could raise sea levels and inundate his archipelago nation.

Over the past year, Mr Nasheed was battered by protests over soaring prices and demands for more religiously conservative policies.

Travellers planning to visit the Maldives for a spot of winter relaxation have been advised to take care and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has updated its advice on visits to the capital Malé.

The FCO is currently advising ‘against all but essential travel to Malé Island’, explaining that ‘there are political demonstrations in the capital Malé, which have resulted in violent clashes between government and opposition supporters, and the police and defence forces.’

‘The situation remains uncertain,’ the guidelines continue. ‘If you are in Malé, or choose to travel to Malé, you should exercise caution, avoid demonstrations and beware of spontaneous gatherings.’
