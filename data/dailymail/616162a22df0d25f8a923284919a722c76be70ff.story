The parents of a sport-mad 11-year-old today told of their anger after school nurses branded him fat.

Alfie Brady, who is 4ft 5ins and 6st, exercises every day taking part in tennis, gymnastics and netball classes.

But after a check-up with the school nurses, his father David and step-mother Julie Haydon were sent a letter telling them Alfie is considered 'overweight' and is likely to become an overweight adult.

The youngster, who rides his scooter to school everyday and regularly roller blades, said he has been left upset by the label, which his parents have branded 'outrageous'.

Experts today told MailOnline the BMI measure is a 'waste of time' unless at least three measurements are taken over a set period of time.

Tam Fry, chair of the Child Growth Foundation said any BMI measurement must be taken in conjunction with an assessment with a healthcare worker, who can make an informed judgement taking into account a child's lifestyle.

'If
 the boy is sporty that immediately tells you he will have more muscle, 
which weighs one and a half times as much as fat - and BMI takes no 
account of that.'

Mr Brady, 41, said: 'To class Alfie as overweight is a disgrace - it’s outrageous.

'He is an active 11-year-old and, due to his gymnastics and other sports he plays, he has a good physique and is quite muscly. He is clearly not overweight.'

The health and safety officer from Portishead, near Bristol, added: 'He was a bit bothered by the letter but we reassured him that he was fine and not overweight at all and that the tests didn’t take into account his muscle.

'Luckily Alfie is sensible enough to accept that there is nothing wrong with how he is. But I am angry that my son has been pigeon-holed in this way.'

Alfie exercises every day, tkaing part in tennis, gymnastics and netball classes. But when measured by nurses at his school, his BMI - calculated from his height and weight - declared he was 'overweight' and in the 93rd percentile for someone of his age

Tam Fry, 
chair of the Child Growth Foundation, said, told MailOnline: 'The thing to remember first
 off is that BMI is a waste of time in that all it will do is tell you 
how tall, how short, how thin or fat a child is on that given day.

'If
 you are to make any kind of judgement about what is appropriate or not 
for that individual child, you either have to measure them again in three
 to six months or use clinical judgement to determine whether the boy is
 normal or overweight.

'If
 the boy is sporty, that immediately tells you he will have more muscle 
which weighs one and a half times as much as fat, and BMI takes no 
account of that.

'When
 making a judgement on any individual you have to actually see the 
person holistically and know a bit about them, whether they are sporty 
or not, or tall for their age.

'It is really important a clinical judgement is made by somebody who knows what they are doing, a healthcare professional.

'Measurements taken at school are sent to parents at home without clinical assessment.

'A
 computer inputs the measurements and BMI into a pre-formed letter and 
that can annoy parents who know exactly how the child lives, exercises, 
eats and their standard of living.

'It is the interaction between the health professional and parents which will achieve a sensible outcome.

'BMI
 is a useful measure but only  when taken sequentially, so a curve can 
predict the child's growth, and whether it is normal or veering towards 
overweight or underweight. And for that you need two, ideally three 
measurements.'

Alfie was weighed and measured by nurses
 from the North Somerset Community Partnership who visited his school, 
Trinity Primary in Portishead, near Bristol, two weeks ago.

He was measured at 137cm, 39.15kg, putting him in the 93rd percentile for this age.

In the letter, the school nursing team said: 'The results suggest that your child is overweight for their age, sex and height.

'If your child is overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult.

'This can lead to health problems. You and your child can make simple changes to be more active and eat more healthily.'

Alfie, from Portishead, said he was upset by the letter and added: 'My mum and dad told me not to believe what it said. I’m pretty happy with the way I look.'

Both Mr Brady and Ms Haydon, 43, are now calling for changes to how the letters are written.

Ms Haydon said: 'The letter is written in a blunt way and is quite patronising.

'What concerns us is if this letter was seen by a child who was more impressionable and already had issues with self-esteem and how they looked.

'To be labelled as overweight like this could have a really negative effect on them and lead to problems with eating disorders in the future.

'What happens in your childhood can affect you for the rest of your life. Children these days are under enough pressure without being labelled like this.'

The North Somerset Community Partnership - who has sent out letters to thousands of parents across the district - has apologised for any upset the letter may have caused.

Fiona Owens, assistant lead for school nursing at NSCP, said: 'The letter was sent as part of the National Child Measurement programme in which all children in reception year and year six have their height and weight checked, unless their parents opt-out.

Mr Brady said: 'To class Alfie as overweight is a disgrace - it's outrageous'

'The heights and weights taken are used to calculate a Body Mass Index (BMI).

'The BMI thresholds have four categories, underweight, healthy weight, overweight or very overweight and this falls in line with guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE).

'Across the country every health provider is asked to provide feedback to parents to try and encourage families to engage with the School Nursing Service.

'They can provide help and support if needed and actively ask parents to get in touch with any concerns.

'This letter was not meant to cause distress or upset and we apologise if this has been the case.

'The School Nursing Service will be contacting Mr Brady direct to discuss this issue further.'
