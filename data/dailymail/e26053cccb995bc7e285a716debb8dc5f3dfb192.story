With their sleek lines, stylish interiors and powerful engines, Bentleys are the king of the road, but now the luxury  brand is trying to conquer a new domain.

Today, the  car firm unveiled its latest machine - a £10,700 phone.

The 'Vertu for Bentley' smartphone is made only from the finest materials: it's handcrafted from grade-5 titanium, solid sapphire crystal and hand-finished calf leather.

That piece of glass and plastic feeling a bit cheap in your hand right now?

The Bentley mobile, which is based on the Android operating system, is almost 20 times the £539 price tag of the new iPhone 6.

Like the smaller version of the new iPhone 6, the 'Vertu for Bentley' has a 4.7-inch screen.

The £10,700 phone also has 13-megapixel camera, for those selfies in the back of your Continental,  a 64gb hard-drive and a battery with a talktime life of up to 15 hours 30 minutes.

The £224,000 Bentley Mulsanne Speed, which will be officially unveiled at the Paris Motor Show next month

But in case customers feel that's a slightly inflated price for a mobile handset, it also comes with its own concierge service.

So if you're sitting in the back of your Bentley (chauffeur driven of course) and suddenly realise you need a holiday to the Bahamas - no need to squint at the screen. A quick call to your personal butler and all will be arranged for you.

The new Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cost a relative snip at £539 and £619 

The luxury phone, launched at the global headquarters of Bentley in Crewe today, is the perfect Christmas gift for the man who has it all (other than, perhaps, a grip on reality).

Kevin Rose, from the luxury car firm, said: 'The partnership between Bentley and Vertu allows customers to experience the Bentley brand while out of the driving seat.

'The look and feel of the handset is a consequence of a strong collaboration between the Bentley and Vertu creative teams.

'The handset's design and materials, when coupled with its exclusive services, integrated Bentley content and high-performance technology, embody what both Bentley and Vertu stand for, and deliver what our customers are looking for.'

Massimiliano Pogliani, boss of Vertu, added: 'The new Vertu for Bentley handset combines English handcraftsmanship, contemporary elegance, outstanding performance and cutting-edge technology.'

But for those who don't rate handcraftmanship top of the list of necessities for their mobile phone, there's always your local Carphone Warehouse.
