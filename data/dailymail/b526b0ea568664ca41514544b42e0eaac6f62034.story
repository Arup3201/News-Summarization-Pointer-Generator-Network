Roy Hodgson defended Wayne Rooney's performance as the England striker came under criticism again after a World Cup performance.

Rooney, who has never scored in three World Cups, endured a frustrating game at times though he laid on England's goal with a great cross for Daniel Sturridge starting on the left and then playing on the right in the second half before going centrally for the final quarter of the game.

Hodgson said: 'We wanted to get Raheem Sterling around because of his agility and of course that meant moving Wayne Rooney and I thought that worked well, He set up the goal for us, he worked very hard and did well also when we brought him back into the centre. There's always going to be one player who there's a big debate around but I think it's very harsh to criticise Rooney's performance today because for me he played.'

Hodgson did concede that Rooney and Leighton Baines had been exposed in the first half by the attacks of the runs of right back Matteo Darmian and significantly Danny Welbeck was moved to the left in the second half to cover him.

'We did struggle in the first half there 
in particular but I think much less in the second half, although we got 
caught upfield for the goal,' he said.

'You can't recover when you go forward as much as we do. We got forward as well but his fun forward helped produce the cross that got them the winning goal.'

Despite the defeat Hodgson singled out his young attacking players for praise. 'I thought all the young players did well. I thought Sturridge had an exceptional time until he got the dead leg. I thought Sterling was as bright as we thought he would be.

'I thought Barkley when he came on did some very good things. I thought Wilshere was showing all the right intentions. And of course we know what Danny Welbeck can give us. None of those players let me down today. They all did what we were hoping â€“ except score an equalising goal.'

Hodgson confirmed that physio Gary Lewin will have to return home, with Steve Kemp taking over responsibilities, after dislocating his ankle in the celebrations for England's goal.

He said: 'It's very sad. He jumped up and landed on a water bottle. He's been taken to hospital. It was very, very painful. The doctor was able to set it at the side of the field but it's the end of the world cup for Gary and a sad moment for him and the team.'
