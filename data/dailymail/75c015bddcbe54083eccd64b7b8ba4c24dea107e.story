Experts have revealed that an increasing number of young people are developing a condition, unique to modern society, that they have dubbed 'Gameboy Back'.

They say the modern phenomenon, which causes curvature of the spine and sometimes herniated (slipped) discs, is a result of children sitting hunched over games consoles and smartphones for hours on end.

They do not however believe a ban on such devices is required. Instead more attention needs to be paid to correct posture, they said.

'Gameboy Back' is affecting increasing numbers of eight to 18-year-olds who spend extended periods of time hunched over a game or smartphone. The last time such a volume of problems was seen, was over 100 years ago when child labour was still common

Surgeons Piet van Loon and Andre Soeterbroek said the last time such symptoms were observed was more than 100 years ago, when child labour was common in Europe.

The problem is particularly prevalent in eight to 18-year-olds.

'In those days, kids got weak back from child labour, now they're getting it from these devices,' Dr Soeterbook told The Irish Times.

'It makes no difference to the body whether you’re hunched over in a cigar factory or spending eight hours over an iPad.'

He and Dr Van Loon are joint authors of an article in the Dutch medical magazine Medisch Contact, which alerts GPs to the trend.

'Essentially, it’s like growing bonsai trees: bone responds in the same way as wood,' said Dr van Loon. 'If you force it in a certain direction over a prolonged period, that’s how it ends up growing.'

The surgeons said that the problem is not the devices themselves, and that the answer is not to ban them.

Instead, more attention needs to be paid to posture: particularly, good sitting habits. They explained that  attention to posture has almost disappeared the world over.

Whats more, parents, physical education teachers and family doctors accept poor posture children and teenagers as normal, they added.

The simplest test for Gameboy back is to have children bend over and touch their toes, making an 'n' shape.

Those with curvature of the spine won’t be able to flex in the middle enough to touch their toes.

Teenagers who sit for hours over a screen with head bowed, forcing the spine to curve outwards, can counter this by lying on their front and propping themselves on their elbows.
