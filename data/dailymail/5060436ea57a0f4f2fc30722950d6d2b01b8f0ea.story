President Vladimir Putin is not known for speaking out about matters of the heart.

But today the Russian leader said he believes in the power of love, adding that it is the whole meaning of life.

Mr Putin made the comments while giving a speech at the Russian Geographical Society on the same day it was claimed a Russian army convoy of 32 tanks crossed into the Ukraine despite the Kremlin vowing to keep a fragile truce.

Speaking to students in Moscow, Vladimir Putin said Stalin was justified in splitting Poland with the Nazis - as the Poles had earlier agreed to do the same thing with Czechoslovakia following the Munich Agreement

Addressing the gathered audience, he started speaking about love saying it is at the heart of his philosophy.

According to the Washington Post, he said: 'The meaning of our whole life and existence is love.

'It is love to the family, to the children, to the motherland. This phenomenon is complicated, it lies at heart of any of our behaviours.'

But despite talking about matters of the heart, Ukraine's military has today claimed that a fleet of Russian tanks including 16 howitzer artillery systems and 30 trucks containing ammunition and fighters crossed the border.

If true it is the latest blow to a truce between pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine's military which has already been broken several times.

Kiev's army spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing the incursion happened yesterday, adding: 'The deployment continues of military equipment and Russian mercenaries to the front lines.

'Supplies of military equipment and enemy fighters from the Russian Federation are continuing'.

Meanwhile earlier, Mr Putin had also explained that there was nothing wrong with Stalin's deal with Hitler to divide up Poland in 1939 because the Poles did the same thing with the Czech Republic in 1938.

Putin met with students and history teachers at the Museum of Modern Russian History in Moscow to discuss a range of issues concerning the First and Second World Wars. He also addressed the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.

He said it was important that Russian academics were involved in attempts to re-write the history of the 20th century so the impact of the Soviet Union was not forgotten.

Commenting on the weeks leading up to World War Two, Putin said: 'But I completely agree with you that we need to fully study this period, as well as others. Why? That period is also interesting.

Putin urged Russian academics to get involved in attempts to rewrite the history of the 20th century so the impact of the Soviet Union is not forgotten or underplayed by western historians and academics 

'Because before that, we had the so-called Munich Agreement in 1938. And what is it? Incidentally, your colleagues in western nations hush it up.

'Chamberlain arrived, shook his paper and said, “I brought you peace” when he returned to London after the talks. To which Churchill, I believe, in private, stated, “Well, now the war is inevitable.”

'Because appeasement of the aggressor, which Nazi Germany was, would clearly lead to a major future military conflict, and some people understood that. There should be a deep multilateral study of what was happening before World War II.'

Putin attempted to claim there was a difference between the Munich Agreement and the non-aggression deal between the Soviet Union and Germany.

Putin said that Joseph Stalin, left, needed time to rearm before he could successfully fight Adolf Hitler, right

He said: 'For example, there are still arguments about the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and the Soviet Union is blamed for dividing Poland. But what did Poland itself do, when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia? It took part of Czechoslovakia. It did this itself. And then, in turn, the same thing happened to Poland.

'I do not want to blame anyone here, but serious studies should show that these were the foreign policy methods at the time. The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression agreement with Germany. They say, “Oh, how bad.” But what is so bad about it, if the Soviet Union did not want to fight? What is so bad?'

Putin said: 'We cannot deny the enormous input of our allies into the victory over Nazi Germany. But we must compare the victims sacrificed at the altar of this common victory, the efforts and significance.

'And to do this, we simply need to restore some information: how many German divisions were on the Eastern Front, and how many fought on the Western Front? Simply the number of tanks, artillery, planes on the Eastern Front and the Western Front. Everything immediately becomes clear. We simply need to talk about this, to repeat it again, to count. But to do this, of course, we must work in the archives.'

He also said it was necessary to compare the 25 million victims in the Soviet Union to the combined allied losses.

Putin said it was important that history properly recorded the sacrifice of the Russian people during conflict

Putin claimed that even Western historians acknowledge that without Russia in 1914, Paris would have fallen

Addressing the First World War, Putin suggests that Russian intervention into the conflict saved Paris.

He said: 'It is very interesting to show the real events of World War I. This is exceedingly important in understanding the relationship between nations, peoples and governments. After all, the allies were playing the game, they were competing against one another, but they also helped one another.

'For example, at the time, everyone knew and said, and nobody denies it today, that Russia saved Paris with its offense.

'We must give credit to the allies that in 1915, when the Russian army suffered a defeat, the allies gathered and began offensive actions at the cost of enormous losses – granted, they did not achieve a result, but they did it. And all of this ought to be discussed, but in order to discuss it, it must be researched.'
