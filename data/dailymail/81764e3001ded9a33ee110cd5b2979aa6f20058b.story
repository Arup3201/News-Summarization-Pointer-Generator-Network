Shocking tragedy: James Bulger was kidnapped from a Liverpool shopping centre and killed

Two young boys apparently tried to lure a young girl away from her mother in a supermarket, in a chilling echo of the James Bulger abduction.

Police have arrested an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old in connection with the incident.

They are now trying to trace the girl's mother, who reported the incident to a security guard at a branch of Asda in the Wavertree area of Liverpool - just a few miles away from where two-year-old James was kidnapped and killed by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables in 1993.

James's mother, Denise Fergus, said the disturbing echo of her son's case made her blood run cold.

'Hearing of the incident from police sent a chill down my spine, it's so similar to what happened to my James,' said Mrs Fergus.

'It's so important that this mother comes forward to tell the full story of what happened.

'The police must have some real concern about what is shown on the CCTV and it's right they should treat this seriously.

They need to get to the bottom of this and she is a vital witness.

'The two who abducted and murdered my son were ten, but they did the worst things imaginable.

'I've been told that the pair involved in this are eleven and twelve but age should never be an excuse.

'I've seen some very calculating 
children. These days some kids are so hard and knowing about the world, 
they are not like normal children at all. They act like little adults.

'These two could have been intending 
to do something terrible to the child they tried to lure away. The 
thought of it made my blood run cold.

'In this case, thank God, nothing bad happened, but it could very easily have been a different story.'

Mrs Fergus urged mothers who are likely to be shopping with their children over the festive period to be vigilant when heading into crowded places with their kids.

She said that the lesson of history should be a warning sign to mothers who, now more than ever, need to be on their guards.

Mrs Fergus said: 'People know how something like this can happen and we all need to be on our guard.

'It only takes a few seconds and a child can be lured away as it did with my James.

'So often you see "lost children" in supermarkets and yet people walk past them. I say that should never happen.

'If there is a lost child or anything suspicious it is up to any adult to take an interest and alert the responsible authorities.

'Most of all, it is essential to challenge any children who claim to be left in charge of much younger ones in public. These days that just should not happen.

'If the people who saw James when he was led away had stepped-in, as they should have done, he could be alive today.'

The two youths aged 11 and 12 arrested 
in connection with this incident have been released on police bail 
pending further enquiries.

Merseyside police confirmed they are still unsure as to the 'full circumstances' which led to the mother reporting the school-aged children to a store guard, who in-turn called police, on November 6.

Merseyside Police released a CCTV image of the mother and urged her to step forward to help with their investigations. The girl is believed to be aged between three and five.

'This is a very disturbing incident, and I'm sure it would have caused a great deal of distress for this woman and her child,' said a police spokesman.

'We are treating this report very seriously and are very keen for this woman to come forward, so we can piece together the full circumstances of this incident.

'Thankfully incidents such as this are rare and while we are not sure of the intentions of the two youths, we would urge members of the public to always reports any incident of this nature to police immediately by calling 999.'
