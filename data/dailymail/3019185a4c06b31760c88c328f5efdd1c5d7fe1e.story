Westminster Magistrates Court: Kazi Jawad Islam, 18, of Manor Park, east London, will appear here tomorrow charged with preparing to commit acts of terrorism contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006

The latest charges come amid a spate of terror arrests, as security services warn of the possibility of retaliation for Britain's involvement in military action against the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq.

On Monday a 26-year-old man was arrested in Hayle, near St Ives in Cornwall, in connection with what police called alleged activities over the Internet in connection to terrorism in Syria.

The suspect - a Bangladeshi national - was yesterday being quizzed on suspicion of preparing for an act of terrorism under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act.

Last month a 21-year-old man, a 32-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman were arrested by anti-terror police in three seperate probes all linked to Syria.

Officers searched two properties in Bedfordshire, two in west London and one in Hackney, north east London after raids over the last three weeks.

Four terror suspects were also charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings earlier last month.

Tarik Hassane, 21, Suhaib Majeed, 20, Nyall Hamlett, 24, and Momen Motasim, 21, all from London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court amid tight security as they were charged with an Islamic State-inspired gun plot.

It was alleged to have been formulated following a fatwa by a senior ISIS terrorist.
