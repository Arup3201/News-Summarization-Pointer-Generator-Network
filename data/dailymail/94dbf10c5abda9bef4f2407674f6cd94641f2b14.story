From filthy clothes dangling from broken coat hangers to beds riddled with mould, these abandoned hotels are a world away from their luxurious past.

The venues are spread across the US - but many owners still keep the exact location secret to protect them from being vandalised or looted.

One of the reasons owners are afraid of looting is that some of the spooky locations still have the likes of TV installed.

Ravaged by time: The Hotel Do De, in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, was a residential hotel with a shared kitchen before it was gutted by fire in 2012

The Lee Plaza Hotel in Detroit was built in 1928 in  Art Deco and Mediterranean style. In its final days it was an assisted living home for the elderly but was seized by the city for unpaid taxes

In this more modern hotel room, the walls and ceiling are deteriorating rapidly while the plastic in the television set still looks new; plastic does not biodegrade like other materials

Photographer Matthew Christopher, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, spent six years travelling the States between 2007 and 2013 taking photos of the abandoned hotels.

The 37-year-old visited Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania for the series, which will feature in his new book Abandoned America: The Age of Consequences, which is released on December 7.

As well as hotels the book also features other interesting abandoned locations he has shot including factories, schools, churches and asylums.

This room, nearly decayed beyond recognition, stands in stark contrast to the one across the hall from it, which is in excellent shape. This is because the roof in one area is gone, but it is intact in the other

At an unnamed resort, the bar area is slowly falling apart, as revealed in this photo by Matthew Christopher for his new book

He said: 'Each hotel represents a window into a different set of lives and a different period of time.

'Most of my finds are either through research, networking with others or dumb luck.

'All three are represented in these buildings - some I just stumbled across but most were places I was either made aware of through friends and business contacts or hunted down information on prior to visiting.

'I photograph any sort of site I can manage access to and I would love to spend more time with abandoned hotels and resorts because there are still so many out there.'
