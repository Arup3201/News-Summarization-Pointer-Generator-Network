Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, who allowed Goodwyn to be freed after a panel of judges sitting at the High Court said it would be unlawful to keep him locked up 

A ‘very dangerous’ paedophile who attacked children as young as seven has been freed from jail on a technicality, it emerged yesterday.

A judge had wanted Jeffrey Goodwyn – convicted of two separate sex attacks on young girls – to stay locked up indefinitely for the public’s protection.

The courts say he is a grave threat to children, and even the sex attacker’s own lawyers say he has made ‘no progress whatsoever’ behind bars.

Yet he was freed after his sentence was ruled ‘unlawful’ because it pre-dated the introduction of legal powers to lock up offenders indefinitely. Incredibly, police have refused to release a photograph of the newly-freed predator in case it makes it harder for Goodwyn to ‘rebuild his life’.

Last night the case sparked fury among MPs and victim groups.

Goodwyn, 48, was sentenced in 2012 for indecently assaulting a seven-year-old girl. The sickening attack took place in 2004 or earlier, with the young victim unable to remember the precise day. He had a previous conviction for raping a nine-year-old.

The judge called Goodwyn ‘a very dangerous offender’ and gave him an IPP (imprisonment for public protection) sentence – which means a person can be held indefinitely.

IPPs were introduced in 2005 and, by the time Goodwyn was sentenced, they had been in force for seven years.

But, because the actual date of his crime pre-dated the introduction of the new powers, the Court of Appeal ruled its imposition was ‘unlawful’.

As a result, he was released from jail two weeks ago.

Mr Justice Coulson, sitting with Britain’s most senior judge Lord Thomas, said yesterday that he had reached his decision ‘unhappily’.

He added: ‘Despite the danger to the public which this applicant clearly represents, we are in no doubt that... the IPP was unlawful.’

The appeal court heard that while in prison Goodwyn refused to transfer to open conditions. The Parole Board described his conduct as unsatisfactory after he threatened staff and was punished for fighting. He also refused to discuss his sexual offending.

An indeterminate prison sentence is where a minimum jail term is set before a defendant can be considered for parole.

Goodwyn had received an IPP, an imprisonment for public protection sentence after being convicted of raping a nine-year-old and sexually assaulting a girl aged seven.

IPP sentences had allowed the authorities to keep the most dangerous criminals locked up indefinitely until they have proved they are safe.

However the Court of Appeal ruled that IPP sentences can only be passed for offences, which happened after April 2005.

In Goodwyn's case, the two offences had occured in October 2001 and May 2004, meaning it was before the Criminal Justice Act 2003 came into force.

Therefore judges ruled that there had been no power to impose an IPP on Goodwyn, which led to his sentence being quashed.

Mr Justice Coulson said: ‘This applicant remains a very dangerous man. Because of his failure to engage with the relevant assistance available to him in prison, he has not begun to address his offending.’ The news sparked immediate demands for police to release a picture of the paedophile, which would be normal when a person is convicted of such a serious offence.

But Gwent Police, which covers the area, last night refused. A spokesman said Goodwyn was now ‘back in the community trying to rebuild his life’ and releasing a picture could disrupt that.

Des Mannion, head of service at the charity NSPCC Wales, said: ‘It is extremely frightening that a child rapist described as “very dangerous” and unrepentant has been released back into the community due to what seems like a legal technicality surrounding the timing of the offence.

‘Sexual offending can be compulsive. Any offender with a history of child sex abuse should be considered a risk to children’s safety for the rest of their lives.’

Mr Mannion called for the disclosure of details about the paedophile. He added: ‘Every measure needs to be taken to ensure our children are kept safe.’

Jenny Willott, Liberal Democrat MP for Central Cardiff, said last night: ‘This is really worrying.

‘Given that both the original sentencing judge and the judge today described Jeffrey Goodwyn as “very dangerous”, I am really concerned that he has been released.

‘I’m sure parents in Cardiff will be worried given the nature of the crimes he has committed. I appreciate this a legally complex case but... I hope safeguards have been put in place to keep children safe.’
