The ‘wild cat of Woodchester' was 
feared to have struck again after the mutilated carcass of a second deer
 was found in a country field.

The savaged animal was found a few 
miles from where the big cat is first believed to have struck in 
Woodchester Park near Stroud, Gloucestershire.

It was found by a woman on Tuesday as
 she walked her dog between Whiteway and Rendcomb, near Cirencester – 
around 10 miles from the scene of the earlier attack.

She went home to get a camera - but 
by the time she returned the deer had been stripped down to its spine, 
and all its vital organs were missing – a similar state to the first 
carcass.

Is this it? This image of a large black animal was captured in a field in north-west Wiltshire and could be the beast that is stalking a Gloucestershire village

Big cat expert Frank Tunbridge, who was first on the scene of the first killing , said he believed the same animal is behind both attacks.

Mr Tunbridge, 65, said: ‘I have seen pictures of this carcass and it is hard to asses because there is not much left.

‘But it has all the hallmarks of a big cat kill. The woman found it in a field but when she came back to take photographs, it was completely stripped out, with just its spine left.

‘I believe it could be the same cat that attacked in Woodchester because, in my experience, these animals usually have a territory of around 100 square miles.

‘Either that or it could be a relative or cub of this cat.’

The animal had been ripped open and was missing its heart, kidneys and liver, he said.

Its snout was also missing - important because big cats clamp their jaws over the mouth, causing death by suffocation.

Experts believe the deer was brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a puma, jaguar or leopard.

Tufts of the animal's fur were also 
found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from 
the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh.

Tuesday’s attack supports the theory of big cat hunters who are convinced a puma or panther is on the prowl.

Investigation: Frank Tunbridge is looking into both attacks, which he thinks were carried out by the same animal

Earlier
 this week a dog walker claimed to have seen a big cat in a field half a
 mile from where a deer had been found on January 4.

That animal was found by dog walkers with its abdomen torn open and major organs including the heart, kidneys and liver missing.

The
 woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was jet black and at 
least the size of a German Shepherd, very powerfully built and with 
large paws, a long tail and a smallish head.’

A positive test result could provide more evidence of big cats living in the British countryside.

Mr Minter, an expert on big cats in 
England who examined the carcass of the six-month-old roe deer, said it 
showed ‘hallmarks of a big cat attack’, adding: ‘The claw and teeth 
impressions are indicative of big cat activity.

‘And the stomach was taken out and 
discarded. Big cats are strict carnivores so they don’t want to eat the 
grass-filled intestines.’

Mr Tunbridge added: ‘Big cats could 
be thriving at the moment because there are plenty of deer around and 
the winter weather creates more cover for them to hunt.

‘Hopefully the DNA test will prove what some of us have thought for years - that these creatures are roaming the countryside.’

Wilf Ashman, 72,  said he had seen a big black cat nearby seven times in the past ten years, most recently in 2010.

Mr Ashman said: ‘It’s not a normal 
feral cat, this is different and bigger.’ A large, panther-like animal 
has been pictured in fields just over the county border in north-west 
Wiltshire.

Examination: A man completes a DNA test on the carcass of the deer. Experts said that the attack had the hallmarks of a big cat due to claw and teeth impressions

Other recent sightings include a ‘pure white predator’ spotted in nearby Nailsworth, just weeks before the deer was killed.

Andy Todd, who said he saw the beast, added: ‘It was pure white. It almost looked like a polar bear.’

Dr Robin Allaby, an expert in 
evolutionary genetics at Warwick University's School of Life Sciences, 
is studying samples of DNA taken from the first carcass.

He said: "I'm prepared to believe in 
the existence of big cats in the UK and we have a reasonable chance of 
finding out if it was there.

"We are in the process of studying 
samples of DNA taken from the deer and if its death was the result of a 
big cat then we're hoping it left cheek cells and saliva.

The DNA tests are expected to be completed later this month.
