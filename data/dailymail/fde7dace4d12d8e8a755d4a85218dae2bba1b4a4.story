A schoolboy has spent three weeks recreating some of cinema's most unforgettable scenes using hundreds of pieces of LEGO.

Morgan Spence, 15, created the two-minute video by crafting the little coloured bricks into clips from dozens of Hollywood classics.

Backed by music from the films themselves, the film includes the most iconic scenes from Dirty Dancing and the Sound of Music, as well as instantly-recognisable snippets from films such as Dracula, ET and Pulp Fiction.

Morgan Spence spent three weeks creating a LEGO film of cinema's most unforgettable scenes, including this scene from Life of Pi

The 15-year-old has created a miniature version of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio standing on the bow of the Titanic for the two-minute video

He also recreated the scene from the Sound Of Music in which Julie Andrews dances and sing on a floral hillside in Austria

Each clip - including this one from The Shining - is backed by famous songs and compositions used in the well-known films 

Cinema fans can also see  miniature versions of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio standing on the bow of the Titanic, Audrey Hepburn enjoying a cigarette in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Morgan's favourite recreation, a scene from Singing in the Rain.

Morgan, of Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, made the video for a project by LEGO masterbuilder Warren Elsmore, who has released a book featuring scenes from 60 cult movies, made with LEGO, called Brick Flicks. Masterbuilders are the highly-trained builders who design all of the official LEGO sets.

Using characters created by specialist website minifigs.me, Morgan made short videos to match the iconic scenes, keeping as close to the originals as possible.

He said: 'He had seen some of my work before and asked if I wanted to create a montage of that. The only thing I had was the characters and none of the backgrounds.

'It was a judgement of what we could do and would be most effective on camera initially. I suppose the trickiest thing was keeping it as accurate as possible and making sure it was instantly recognisable. It was mostly pretty straightforward. It was more the set design and making it look good on camera.'

Morgan's favourite scene - and the first to feature on the film - is from Singing in the Rain. He loves this scene because it is so recognisable, he said 

Morgan said: 'I suppose the trickiest thing was keeping it as accurate as possible and making sure it was instantly recognisable'. Pictured: A scene from Pulp Fiction 

Honey Ryder, left, and James Bond, right, from the James Bond film Dr No, were recreated for the clip. The figures were created by specialist website minifigs.me 

Each scene - lasting just a few seconds at a time - took anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours to film. Pictured: A scene from ET

Other iconic scenes - which Morgan tried to keep as close to the original as possible - include this scene of 'the lift' from Dirty Dancing 

LEGO-loving Morgan used his bedroom for his films, having set up a small studio. Pictured: A LEGO scene from Wayne's World 

It took Morgan three weeks to put the two-minute video together, which by stop-motion standards is 'a quick turnaround', he said. 

He added: 'I'm quite proud of the results. My favourite one was Singing in the Rain because it's such an iconic film scene and it's so recognisable.'

Each scene - lasting just a few seconds at a time - took between 15 minutes to two hours to film. He created the scenes from his bedroom, where he set up a small studio for the project.

He said: 'It does require quite a bit of patience.' 

Morgan became interested in stop-motion movie-making in 2011, after creating a film for a school project. Pictured: A scene from Laurel and Hardy

The teenager focussed on Hollywood classics and scenes which would be easy  to recognise, including this from Laurel and Hardy

Morgan also put together a scene from Dracula for the film. He said he likes using LEGO because it 'lets the imagination run free'

Another scene he created was from The Wizard of Oz, featuring all of the main characters and the famous Yellow Brick Road 

Morgan has already achieved fame by creating a music video for superstar DJ Paul Oakenfold

He has his sights set on film-making as a future career, with plans to study the subject once he finishes school. Pictured: Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's

Morgan first became interested in stop-motion film-making in 2011, after creating a film for a Second World War project at school.

He said: 'I thought I could maybe do something different. I animated Airfix planes in a Battle of Britain dog fight. It went down well at school so I thought I might as well combine this with my hobby - LEGO. Then I branched into commercial work.'

Morgan has already achieved fame having created a music video last year for superstar DJ Paul Oakenfold. The artist asked Morgan to direct the video for his single, Who Do You Love, using LEGO.

And, unsurprisingly, Morgan has his sights set on film-making as a future career. He plans to study the subject once he finishes school. 

He said: 'I'd like to continue doing stop motion and move into live action. I really do enjoy the animation. I'm a big fan of LEGO - it lets my imagination run free.'
