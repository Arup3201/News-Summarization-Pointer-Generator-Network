Kim Jong Un called for the two Koreas to be reunited during a surprise New Year's speech last night.

In the first television address by a North Korean leader for 19 years, he said he wanted an end to 'confrontation' between the two countries.

But he also promised to boost the country's military power and make the science and technology sector world class.

Kim John Un gave the first television address to the nation by a North Korean leader for 19 years

In what appeared to be a pre-recorded address for state television, Kim Jong Un said: 'An important issue in putting an end to
 the division of the country and achieving its reunification is to 
remove confrontation between the north and the south.

'The past records of inter-Korean relations show that confrontation between fellow countrymen leads to nothing but war.'

Kim's grandfather, national founder Kim Il Sung, would routinely 
address his people on New Year's Day, but his father, Kim Jong 
Il, avoided making public speeches.

He
 never gave a television address during his 17-year-rule, and his New Year's 
messages were published as joint editorials in the nation's three major 
newspapers.

Fireworks exploded over Kim Il Sung Square in celebration of the New Year following the speech.

Kim Jong Un outlined plans to improve the impoverished nation's economy through science and technology.

'The
 industrial revolution in the new century is, in essence, a scientific 
and technological revolution, and breaking through the cutting edge is a
 shortcut to the building of an economic giant,' he said.

He
 then pointed at the success of a long-range rocket that North Korea 
fired on December 12 carrying a satellite into space, drawing international condemnation.

'Let
 us bring about a radical turn in the building of an economic giant with
 the same spirit and mettle as were displayed in conquering space,' he 
said.

North Korea has tested two atomic devices since 2006, both times weeks after U.N. condemnation of a long-range launch.

A recent analysis of North Korea's main nuclear test site indicates readiness for a possible third atomic explosion.

Kim made no mention of nuclear weapons, but indicated that the military will continue to be boosted.

'The sector of defense industry should develop in larger numbers sophisticated military hardware of our own style that can contribute to implementing the Party's military strategy,' he said.

'Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country and defend the security and happiness of its people.'

The speech came amid scuffles as activists tried to send balloons carrying anti-North Korean propaganda into the country from the demilitarised zone.

The group of activists sent millions of propaganda leaflets towards North Korea by balloons urging citizens to rise up against their leader Kim Jong Un

The two Koreas have seen tensions rise to the highest level in decades after the North bombed a Southern island in 2010 killing two civilians and two soldiers.

The sinking of a South Korean navy ship earlier that year was blamed on the North but Pyongyang has denied it and accused Seoul of waging a smear campaign against its leadership.

Last month, South Korea elected as president Park Geun-hye, a conservative daughter of assassinated military ruler Park Chung-hee whom Kim Il-sung had tried to kill at the height of their Cold War confrontation.

Park has vowed to pursue engagement with the North and called for dialogue to build confidence but has demanded that Pyongyang abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions, something it is unlikely to do.

Conspicuously absent from Kim's speech was any mention of the nuclear arms program.
