A teenage beauty queen who suffered 25 per cent burns to her face and body after she was seriously injured in a freak explosion has taken to the catwalk to compete in a top beauty contest.

Plastic surgeons performed three skin graft operations on Lucy Morgan after a can of flammable liquid blew up in her face on March 9 this year while she sat next to a bonfire with friends.

Miss Morgan frantically tried to dampen the fire but by the time a friend had used a blanket to stop the burning she had suffered horrendous burns and her tights had disintegrated.

Despite the injuries, the 19-year-old became a contestant in the glamorous Miss Leeds contest on Saturday night and made it to the final ten.

Miss Morgan did not end up in the final three, but she said just making it to the competition was 'quite an achievement' for her.

Wearing a floor length white gown, her right hand and arm covered by a long black glove, the student said she took her inspiration from acid attack victim Katie Piper.

Former model and TV presenter Piper suffered horrific facial injuries after an ex-boyfriend arranged to have sulphuric acid thrown in her face.

Since the attack she has established a charity, the Katie Piper Foundation, aimed at raising awareness of the plight of victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries.

Miss Morgan, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said: 'Katie Piper is my role model, she had her own problems in life but went on to help other people in their lives.

'She is a great inspiration to me.'

Speaking after the contest, keen horserider Miss Morgan said she wasn't disappointed with her placing.

'Just making it here is a massive personal achievement for me. I hope it shows other people that if you have scars or disability you don't have to hold back in life.'

She added that she now wants to set up a charity called the Phoenix Trust to help others.

Miss Morgan said: 'The accident happened just a week after I won my place in the event and, sitting in pain in my hospital bed with my anesthetised body covered in bandages, I thought it was an impossible dream to take part.

'My world had been turned upside down in an instant.

Miss Morgan posted this image of her hand following a skin graft, which used skin from her leg, on Facebook on March 21. She has had two other skin grafts while in hospital

'I did think about dropping out but I am lucky as it could have been a lot worse - I could have lost my sight.

'People
 believe you have to be perfect to take part. But thanks to the amazing 
skills of the team of doctors and nurses at the regional burns unit at 
Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield who have overseen the first stages of
 my recovery, I am going to do it anyway.

'I hope other burns victims who are unlucky enough to find themselves in the same situation that I did can find some inspiration from me.'

The winner of the Miss Leeds competition had to demonstrate charity work, take part in a catwalk, do a model photoshoot, and showcase other talents. 

In Miss Morgan's case she showed a video of her horesriding skills.

The winner of the competition - art student Molly Wragg - will now go on to the grand finals of Miss England in June.
