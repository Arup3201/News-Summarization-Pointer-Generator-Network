While the likes of Google, Amazon and Apple are trying to make tablets smaller and thinner, Panasonic has decided to buck this trend with a giant touchscreen device. 

The Toughpad is a 20-inch 4K tablet - almost three times the size of Google’s Nexus 7 - and runs Windows software. 

It also weighs over 5lbs, which is five times heavier than Apple’s new iPad Air, but is just half an inch thick.

Panasonic unveiled its Toughpad tablet, pictured, earlier this year and has now announced the 20-inch device will go on sale in the U.S in January. UK prices and release dates haven't been confirmed.The tablet's screen is three times bigger than Google's Nexus 7, and it weighs five times more than Apple's iPad Air

Screen: 20"

Resolution: 3,840 x 2,560

PPI: 230

Processor: Intel i5 1.9GHz

Memory: 8GB RAM

Storage: 256GB

Battery life: Two hours

The huge size and screen also means the device comes with a two-hour battery life despite costing $5,999.

Panasonic hasn’t designed the tablet for consumers, though. Instead it is aiming the device at hospitals, museums, architects and construction sites. 

It is called Toughpad because it has been made of reinforced glass fibre and has a magnesium alloy case. 

The 4K technology in the screen has been dubbed the next-generation in high-quality displays, and the Toughpad has a resolution of 3,840 x 2,560.

This gives it a pixel-per-inch density of 230, putting it slightly above the quality of Apple’s 13-inch Macbook Pro. 

The tablet additionally has an Intel i51.9Ghz processor, 8GB of RAM and comes with 256GB of built-in storage -  the same amount offered on high-end Apple iPads and Google’s 12.85-inch Chromebook Pixel.

Bill Mannion, Microsoft’s director of Windows Consumer Marketing said: ‘This is as close as I’ve ever seen to real life on a display. It literally is like looking out of the window.'

Panasonic is also offering an Electronic Touch Pen that works like a stylus, similar to Samsung’s S-Pen. 

It is said to give 2,000 levels of pressure by using infrared signals and Bluetooth to analyse and read the screen’s individual pixels, making it highly accurate and responsive.

Panasonic is not the first company to launch a 20-inch device; HP recently launched a giant tablet called the HP Envy Rove 20.

It is almost twice the weight of Panasonic's Toughpad, at 12.27lbs, and the screen resolution is 1,600 x 900, yet because of the lower-quality features and age it costs a much cheaper $979.
