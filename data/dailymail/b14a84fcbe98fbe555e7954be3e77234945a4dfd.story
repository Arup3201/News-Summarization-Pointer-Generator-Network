Sarah Palin's daughter-in-law Britta Hanson has shrugged off the end of her 18 month marriage to the family values advocate's eldest son Track, as it is revealed she will get custody of the couple's daughter Kyla - and Track will get the gun collection.

Hanson, 22, tied the knot with Track, 23, on an Alaskan mountain near the Palin home in May 2011 and gave birth to their little girl three months later.

But quizzed about her impending divorce yesterday, she seemed happy the short-lived marriage was coming to an end, insisting 'I'm fine with it.'

'We just filed the papers so we aren't 
divorced yet,' she told RadarOnline. 'I'm not sure how long it will take
to get the divorce finalized.'

Track's relationship breakdown isn't the first domestic disaster in the Palin household. His divorce comes after his sister Bristol's ongoing family dramas.

Bristol famously got pregnant in 2008, just days after Sarah Palin was announced as John McCain's running mate, and gave birth to a little boy, Tripp, at age 18.

She was twice engaged to the child's father, her high school boyfriend Levi 
Johnston, but broke it off both times and the pair are now locked in a bitter custody battle.

TMZ revealed this week that Track and Britta's seemingly happy love story was over after the pair jointly filed for divorce in an Alaskan court, in a further blow to Palin - a strong advocate for the traditional family unit.

Custody: According to the court papers, Britta gets physical custody of little Kyla, pictured right with Track and the rest of the Palin family, and will share legal custody with Track

Under Alaska law, filing for divorce 
together means Track and Britta have fully settled their property and 
custody issues, including child support for Kyla, who is now
15 months old.

According to TMZ, which got its hands
on the court documents, Track walks away with his most prized 
possessions, his gun collection, worth $1,000.

The Army reservist also gets the 
$30,000 Wells Fargo bank account and $500 worth of tools, while his 
soon-to-be ex-wife Britta will walk away with her $2,500 bank account 
and her $4,000 in jewelry.

According to the court papers, Britta gets physical custody of little Kyla, and will share legal custody with Track.

Track earns $42,800 a year and has 
agreed to pay $642 a month in child support, with any other 
child-related expenses, including medical and travel costs, being split 
in half.

The agreement also requires
Track and Britta to watch a 48-minute video showing them how to explain
the breakup of the family to their child.

Happy: The couple seemed happy about the birth of their child, though things obviously went downhill

In the interview with RadarOnline, Britta said she and Track are trying to keep a low profile while the divorce goes through.

'We want to keep our personal lives private and we don't want to say anything about each other or the situation,' she said.

But she did say of her little girl: 'She's perfect. She's just so sweet.'

Yesterday, Britta's mother, Elizabeth Hanson, confirmed the couple had separated.

Delighted: At the wedding, Sarah Palin, pictured, said the families looked forward to the couple's long life together

She told MailOnline: 'They're not divorced, but they are separated.

'They're both very private and all I can say is that
they're concentrating on working to be the best parents they can be to their
daughter.'

Abstinence 
preacher Sarah Palin claimed she couldn't be happier when the high 
school sweethearts wed in a ski slope ceremony last May.

In a joint statement with Britta's parents, Ms Hanson and and Reverend Duane Hanson, who performed the ceremony, the Palin's said they looked forward to the couple's 'blessed' life together, but didn't mention the pregnancy.

'Our families couldn't be 
happier! These are two hard working, humble, active, studious young 
adults who grew up together,' the parents said.

'We're tickled that after two decades
of friendship we proudly witnessed their marriage, knowing their new 
life together will be blessed.'

After Kyla's birth, Britta's mother 
expressed her delight over her first grandchild, telling RadarOnline the
little girl was 'great.'

'She’s beautiful. I’m very happy,' she said. 'I love my daughter and my son-in-law very much.'

It's unclear what led to the couple's marriage unraveling.

Kyla Grace is the second of Palin's 
grandchildren after her daughter Bristol gave birth to Tripp, in 2008.

Palin has famously advocated that schools teach 
teenagers to abstain from sex before marriage and became an even stronger advocate after her daughter's unintended pregnancy.

Pictures of an excited Britta before the couple's daughter was born suggested they were happy about the impending birth.

One photo captioned 'my beautiful 
britta pie!' taken after a baby shower, shows
the expectant mother smiling brightly and surrounded by gifts.

Another, posted on a Wasilla woman's Facebook wall, shows Britta holding up a small hoodie as she smiles at the camera.

Track became the first Palin child to get married when the couple wed last May.

He spent a year with the Army in 
Iraq as a reservist before the wedding. Britta studied nursing at the University of Alaska.
