Angry Everton manager Roberto Martinez claimed champions Manchester City should have had two men sent off by referee Andre Marriner in a feisty evening game at The Etihad Stadium.

City defender Eliaquim Mangala left Samuel Eto'o with bad bruising on his back after a high and dangerous kung-fu style kick and later on Fernando's boot was even higher when he caught Gareth Barry on the forehead as they challenged for the ball soon after Yaya Toure had controversially given City a 24th-minute lead from the penalty spot.

Martinez, who was also unhappy that Phil Jagielka had been penalised for a challenge on James Milner for the spot-kick, said: 'I don't like players being sent off but when you get a referee who gives a penalty to the letter of the law, Mangala is a red card every time.

'The ball is clearly headed away by Eto'o, it is not 50-50, and Mangala's foot and knee are high in an unnatural position. It is violent conduct and Eto'o has a strong mark where he was kicked.

'Fernando is more unfortunate, he is challenging for the ball but it is a high boot. If he doesn't touch the head of Gareth Barry, it is a yellow card. But if he does touch it, which he did, it is a red.'

Martinez was also critical of the penalty award which led to the only goal of the game.

He said: 'To say I am disappointed is an understatement. The penalty should not have been allowed at all.

'There was clear contact, which is something that is allowed. It is a ball that is played into the 18-yard box, and the defender is allowed to challenge.

'Milner changes direction and Phil Jagielka carries on with his run, he can't disappear, so there is going to be a coming together. There was nothing below the waste, everything is hip and shoulder.

'Milner gets up immediately and fights for the ball which says it all. He was not even asking for a penalty. If it is a shoulder to shoulder, it is part of the game and shouldn't be penalised.'

Martinez also complained the referee made his decision too hastily.

'I am more disappointed with the way it was given so quickly. It was an instant reaction and a very disappointing decision.'

The Spaniard's frustrated was increased when he thought Frank Lampard made a similar challenge on Ross Barkley by the halfway line and wasn't punished. 'It's inconsistency,' he fumed.

Everton are stuck in 11th place in the table, some way below expectations, but Martinez said: 'There wasn't very much between the two teams. When the penalty was given, our confidence left us. But I have never come to City before and they have had only three shots on target.'

He has decided not to take his complaints about Mr Marriner's decisions any further – believing it would be a waste of time.

'When you are young and inexperienced, you want to fight the world and put it right,' he said.

'It is better for me to focus on my team and work on how they respond to bad decisions. You realise as you get older you will get good and bad decisions. So I really look forward to the second half of the season because it will be so easy to win games.'
