Stuart McCall has agreed to make an emotional return to Rangers after answering the call to salvage their promotion campaign.

The Nine-in-a-Row legend will take over as manager until the end of the season in a bid to steer the Ibrox club back to the top flight via the Championship play-offs.

Caretaker boss Kenny McDowall, who handed in his notice in January, is not expected to play any role in the new first-team coaching set-up.

That could open the way for McCall to bring in Kenny Black, his assistant during a successful stint in charge at Motherwell.

McDowall admitted after Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Queen of the South that there was now a danger of Rangers missing out on the play-offs altogether if they didn’t find form. They have won just one of their last seven matches, dropping to third place in the table behind Hibs.

That dismal sequence convinced Dave King and the new Ibrox board that they had to act, with McCall approached to see if he would be willing to agree a short-term contract. An extended deal contingent upon winning promotion could also be a possibility following a day of discussions.

No official confirmation on McCall’s appointment was forthcoming from Rangers on Wednesday night but that is expected to follow on Thursday.

It is also understood the players were told to report back to Murray Park early on Friday morning – after a day off – in preparation for meeting their new boss.

McCall, who won six league titles in seven years as a Rangers midfielder, has been out of work since resigning at Fir Park last November after a slump in form. 

However, his overall record in Lanarkshire was hugely impressive, including back-to-back second-place finishes and a Scottish Cup final.

The 50-year-old is also currently a member of Gordon Strachan’s Scotland backroom staff but admitted last month it may be an ‘impossibility’ to combine that role with managing a club of Rangers’ size.

King flew back to South Africa via Heathrow on Wednesday, admitting in an interview en route that ‘the playing side is in need of a huge injection of energy’. He also added that the new regime would do ‘whatever it takes to give the club the best chance of promotion this season’.

McCall is the man they have turned to for that purpose, with Saturday’s home game against Livingston set to open his tenure. 

Gordon Strachan has also used McCall as part of his coaching set-up with the Scotland national team

Speaking last week, Rangers midfielder and ex-Motherwell player Nicky Law welcomed the prospect of a McCall appointment.

‘For me personally, it would be great,’ said Law. ‘Not just for me, but for the club as well. ‘He’s a legend here and he knows about the club and the expectations. There would be no trouble with him there. 

'With his character, it’ s something he would relish. It wouldn’t worry him at all. I’m sure he’d get a positive reaction straight away just with his demeanour and the way he is. If he’s lucky enough to get it I’m sure he’ll do a great job.’

Meanwhile, Sandy Easdale has agreed to step down from his position as football board chairman and will make an ‘amicable’ exit from Rangers.

The Ibrox club announced on Tuesday that Easdale, Derek Llambias and Barry Leach had been suspended from their duties ‘pending investigation’. 

Any proceedings relating to the Greenock-based businessman have, however, been dropped.
