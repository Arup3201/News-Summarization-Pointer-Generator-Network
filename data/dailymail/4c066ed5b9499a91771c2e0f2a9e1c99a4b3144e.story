A Wyoming college student visiting Denver on spring break jumped to his death after eating a marijuana cookie that his friend legally purchased in one of Colorado's recreational pot shops, authorities said Wednesday.

An autopsy report lists marijuana intoxication as a 'significant contributing factor' in the death of 19-year-old Levi Thamba Pongi, a native of the Republic of Congo who witnesses say leaped from a Holiday Inn balcony on March 11.

Pongi's death is now the first in the state listed with such a cause since Colorado legalized marijuana January 1.

Pongi's friends told investigators he ate the cookie and 'exhibited hostile behavior' that included pulling things off walls and speaking erratically, the report said.

Attempts by the three friends to calm Pongi seemed to work until he went outside and jumped over the balcony railing, according to the report.

Denver police ruled the death an accident and their investigation remains open.

Michelle Weiss-Samaras, a spokeswoman for the Denver County medical examiner's office, told the Denver Post that investigators have no evidence Pongi had underlying psychological issues.

'We have no history of any other issues until he eats a marijuana cookie and becomes erratic and this happens," she said. 'It's the one thing we have that's significant.'

Colorado law bans the sale of 
recreational marijuana products to people under 21. Possession by people
 under 21 is also against the law.

Authorities said one of Pongi's friends was old enough to buy the cookie from a pot shop.

The
 medical examiner's office had Pongi's body tested for at least 250 
different substances, including bath salts and synthetic marijuana, 
which are known to cause strange behavior.

Rare fatality: Pongi died after leaping form a fourth story Holiday Inn balcony. He and some friends had driven to Denver over spring break to try legal marijuana

His blood tested positive only for THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, according to the report.

'We were told they came here to try it,' said Weiss-Samaras

One of Pongi's friends also tried the cookie but stopped after feeling sick.

The marijuana concentration in Pongi's blood was 7.2 nanograms of active THC per milliliter of blood. Colorado law says juries can assume someone is driving while impaired by marijuana if their blood contains more than 5 nanograms per milliliter of the chemical.

Officials at Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, say Pongi started taking classes as an exchange student in January. He was studying engineering.

'The Northwest College campus community continues to grieve after Levy's death,' the college said in a statement. 'All of us were deeply saddened by this tragic incident and feel for his family.'

Sad: Marijuana cookies like these are legal to buy and consume in much of Colorado. However, Pongi was 19 and you must be 21 to buy pot in the state. Officials believe one of the teen's friends was old enough to make the purchase
