Manchester United have made no move to register goalkeeper Victor Valdes with the Barclays Premier League this week, effectively ruling him out of Saturday’s game at Arsenal.

United are in the grip of a deepening injury crisis with midfielders Daley Blind and Michael Carrick and goalkeeper David de Gea returning from the international break with injuries.

De Gea’s finger dislocation makes him a doubt for the weekend – although that hasn’t been confirmed yet – and there has been speculation that United manager Louis van Gaal may overlook regular No 2 Anders Lindegaard at the Emirates this weekend and try and push the experienced former Barcelona keeper Valdes in to emergency service.

The 32-year-old is a free agent and has been training at United while he recovers from a knee injury.

Valdes is close to fitness now but United would have to officially add him to their Premier League squad in order for him to play and it is understood that has not happened.

There is room in United’s official list for Valdes as they are not currently up to their 25-man maximum permitted by the league. However, an application to add the 32-year-old would take a number of days and the fact United have not even started the process would appear to suggest Lindegaard will play this weekend if De Gea is not fit.

As regards De Gea, the United No 1 sat on the bench as Spain beat Belarus over the weekend, rather than being sent home to his club as would usually be the case when a player is seriously injured.

The 24-year-old - who has been linked with a move to Real Madrid - told the Spanish press that Valdes is not being signed as a replacement for him.

'Yes, my contract runs out in 2016. But they didn't sign him for that,' De Gea told Spanish newspaper AS.

'Victor had a difficult injury, he had a bad time and the boss knows him well and has given him the opportunity to recover.

'Yes, Victor is training over in Manchester, he's still not 100 per cent after his injury. When he is fully fit he will start to train with us. He's still not training in goal with us. From time to time he comes out with the goalkeeping coach but very little still.

'Van Gaal knows him well because he gave Victor his debut at Barca and has a special affection for him and whenever possible we have to help where we can.

'Football is cruel at times, it's difficult. When things go well you're very good and when they go badly, well it's awful.'
