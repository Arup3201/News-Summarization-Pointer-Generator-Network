Alan Pardew has warned his Newcastle players they could be substituted early if they fail to handle what promises to be a poisonous atmosphere inside St James’ Park.

The United boss is bracing himself for a mass supporter protest against his management of the team.

One group – SackPardew.com – have printed 35,000 A4 cards calling for him to be sacked.

Pardew is concerned that such a toxic atmosphere will spread to the pitch.

Alan Pardew has vowed to hook any Newcastle players who struggle with the St James' Park atmosphere

And, to that end, he admits he could be forced to withdraw players affected by unrest in the stands.

‘I would not say this is a normal negative game. I think it is a little more than that,’ said Pardew ahead of the visit of Hull City.

‘I have tried to express to the players that this is a place where emotions run high.

‘It’s an emotional crowd which relays itself on to the pitch. The players are going to have to deal with it.

‘I don’t really know the answer to what they are going to be like. I will look for players who I think are struggling with the situation, more so to protect them. It may well be that at half-time, I make an early change.

‘It might be that the situation has got too much for that individual player, not because he is necessarily playing poorly.’

Newcastle are bottom of the Premier League heading in to the game and owner Mike Ashley has given Pardew no guarantees over his future, although Sportsmail understands his job is safe in the short term at least.

It was during the final home game of last season – a 3-0 win over Cardiff – that fans hissed their disapproval every time Pardew ventured in to his technical area.

And he said: ‘That was the first time I have ever experienced that. As a manager, you have to use your knowledge and resolve to deal with certain situations.

‘I had some really testing times last season, as we know.

‘But it can also make you stronger - it can make the players stronger too. We have talked about the Cardiff game and coming through that. We knew before that game how much pressure there would be.’

Pardew, though, is in bullish mood ahead of the game and even found time to share a joke before outlining his determination to stay in the job.

‘Of course (I’m bracing myself). You don’t expect me to wave to the crowd and say, “Hi everyone, I’m happy, how are you today?”. That’s not happening,’ he went on.

‘I’m not nervous at the moment and I’m not in fear of it either. That’s not an ego or an arrogance thing, that’s just the way I am wired.

‘I kind of want the game now, I want to play it. I want to get it done and I want to get a win.’ 

Meanwhile, Pardew will come face to face with David Meyler for the first time since headbutting the Hull midfielder in March.

His actions cost him a £100,000 club fine, £60,000 FA fine and a seven-game touchline ban, which included three matches excluded from the stadium.

But Pardew said: ‘Obviously I have had to change. It is an incident I apologised for and regretted.

‘I have not seen him since. I will shake his hand and I am sure he will smile at me. It is something I’d like to think that I have learnt from.’
