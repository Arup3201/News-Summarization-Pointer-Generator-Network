Raheem Sterling started on the bench by Roy Hodgson for England’s Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia in Tallinn after complaining of feeling tired.

The Liverpool winger, who came on for Jordan Henderson after 64 minutes, did not complete training on Saturday night and spoke with the England manager.

Sterling only played 45 minutes in Thursday’s 5-0 win over San Marino and was replaced by Adam Lallana at half time.

Lallana started in place of Sterling in Tallinn but after coming on the livewire forward won the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored for England.

'Yesterday we trained  but Raheem was complaining a little about being tired and was not at his best. So we won't risk him and Lallana is in fine form,' Hodgson told ITV before the game.

'We can use him as a sub. Adam was very good against San Marino and interpreted the role behind the two attackers very well.

'They are different types of players and both feature strongly.' 

Given Hodgson’s comments on Thursday, it was perhaps no surprise that Lallana started.

He said: ‘Lallana, when he came on for Raheem, was every bit as dangerous and inventive and creative as Raheem could be. That's nice to know.’

Sterling trained with the England substitutes before the game and took part in a game of keep ball. He then took part in shooting practice – blasting his first effort well wide, and his second over the bar.

He was more effective when he came on, however. 

Adam Lallana replaced Sterling against San Marino on Thursday and starts in his place in Estonia 

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will hope Sterling will be fit during a busy spell of upcoming fixtures, with their next three games played within six days: Oct 19 – QPR (a), Oct 22 – Real Madrid (h), Oct 25 – Hull (h).
