Taxpayers are picking up the bill for civil servants to hire ball gowns and dinner suits.

Whitehall staff have received thousands of pounds through the ‘evening dress allowance’, new figures reveal.

It is just the latest revelation about the extra perks and expenses enjoyed by government officials despite three years of austerity.

Officials at government departments can claim back the cost of hiring or buying dinner suits or evening dresses to attend official functions

Under official Whitehall rules staff can claim for the cost of hiring evening dress to attend official work functions.

And if there are three events in the diary they can ask the taxpayer to help to buy them a suit or a dress.

At the Ministry of Defence alone, expense claims for evening dress have reached almost £16,000 since 2008.

Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills paid out almost £3,000 from December 2011 and to May 2013.

At least five other departments offer the evening dress allowance but could not say how much it cost the taxpayer.

Details of the use of public money for civil servants to attend black tie events and dinners were revealed by Tory MP Priti Patel in a series of parliamentary questions.

She said: 'British taxpayers will be astounded to 
see that they have been footing the bill for new suits and gowns for 
civil servants attending fancy events.

'Perhaps this is another public 
sector perk to undress ahead of the comprehensive spending review.'

Defence minister Andrew Robathan said 80 members of staff have claimed £15,793 on expenses to hire or buy evening dress since 2008, including 14 people in the last year.

He added: 'This allowance is for the hire of evening dress by civilian staff for official functions, or for the purchase of it if more than three functions are foreseen, in which case 75 per cent of the cost may be recovered through the allowance. However this is only available once in every 10 years.'

Treasury minister Sajid Javid confirmed staff in George Osborne's department were able to claim for an evening dress allowance, but could not say how much it has cost the state.

He said: ‘This is a taxable benefit and is paid through staff salary; to attempt to extract this information would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold.

‘All staff must refer to the Department’s travel and subsistence policy when making a claim for evening dress allowance and must obtain pre-approval from a director for the expenditure.’

The Home Office, the Department for Education, the Scotland Office and the Department for Transport also said they did not keep separate records for the cost of hiring evening dress.

Solicitor General Oliver Heald said it paid £75 for someone to hire full evening dress for an official engagement in July 2008.

Matthew
Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It is 
totally unacceptable that a small number of civil servants are billing 
taxpayers for thousands of pounds a year to pay for their glad rags.

Staff can claim back the cost of hiring a dinner suit, or buy one if they will be attending three official functions

'The civil servants in question are doubtless being well fed and watered at these official functions at our expense, so making us pay for their clothes as well is beyond a joke.

'This is yet another example of the kind of perk enjoyed by civil servants which would be a non-starter in the private sector.'

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Cabinet Office, the Department for International Development, the Northern Ireland Office and the Wales Office and the Department of Health said they had not made any payments for officials.

A Government spokesman said: 'We are reviewing Civil Service terms and conditions as part of our Civil Service Reform programme.

'The Civil Service will remain a good employer so it can attract and retain high quality staff.

'However some of its conditions have become outliers in comparison to the wider public and private sector and these will be addressed.'

Earlier this month it emerged that Whitehall staff are being paid extra bonuses worth thousands of pounds just for doing their job.

Extra allowances are given to civil servants for being good at typing, knowing first aid, being green and working late. Critics said the payouts were outdated and must be abolished at a time of austerity.

Dozens of staff in government departments and agencies are eligible for the extra cash on top of their salaries.

At Eric Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government, staff can receive £144 for being a fire marshal, £200 as a first aider and £600 in a 'green allowance'.

They can also be paid £3,160-a-year for being on call and up to £1,092 for 'typing proficiency'.

Spending on the allowances and subsidies last year was £946,600, 23 per cent higher than in 2011-12.
