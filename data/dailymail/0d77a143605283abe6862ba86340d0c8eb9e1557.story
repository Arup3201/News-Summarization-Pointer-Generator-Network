Forget increasing output and booming high street sales. If you want to measure the strength of Britain’s economic recovery, look in the hands of children.

There has been a 52p annual rise in pocket money to £6.50 a week, plus a greater proportion of youngsters are now receiving a handout from mum and dad.

Children are picking up the most pocket money on average since 2007, in a further sign that families are starting to feel better about the economy.

Cashing in: British children are being given the highest amount of pocket money since 2007

A survey by Halifax also found a rise in the proportion of children receiving pocket money from 77 per cent in 2012 to 84 per cent now as households ease their purse strings.

But there also appears to be gender ‘pay gap’ similar to that seen in the workplace, with boys receiving more money from their parents than girls – £6.67 as opposed to £6.32.

However, girls are more accepting of what they receive. Just over one third (38 per cent) think they should get more, compared with almost half (44 per cent) of boys.

Children in the North West  are the most likely to receive pocket money, at 90 per cent, while those in the South East are the least likely at 78 per cent, according to the survey of more than 1,200 children aged between eight and 15.

For millions of people, the middle-class idyll is becoming a distant mirage. Today, many people are starting to realise they will probably never enjoy the comforts their parents took for granted

But it is young Londoners who receive most – £8.46 on average – while those in the South West receive least, at £6.26.

While children need to be aged 16 before they can register for their own online banking, the survey found that one in 12 (8 per cent) used the internet in some way to manage their cash.

Halifax said the positive shift in pocket money ‘reflects a growing confidence in the current economic environment’.

Evidence of the improving economy has recently been shown in areas such as spending, with retail sales rising. And the Treasury said last week that Britain was ‘moving from rescue to recovery’ after the release of better than expected growth figures.
