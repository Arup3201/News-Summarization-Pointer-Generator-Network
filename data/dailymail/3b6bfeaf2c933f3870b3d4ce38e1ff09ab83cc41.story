Police are hunting a woman after she took a photo of herself on a stolen iPad.

The image of the brunette, who was pictured pouting at the camera, appeared after the gadget was stolen in a house burglary in Rushden, Northamptonshire in December last year.

Three weeks after the break-in, the owner of the iPad spotted photographs of the mystery woman on the online iCloud system which is linked to his device.

Northamptonshire Police are now attempting to track the woman down in case she has information about the burglary.

A force spokesman said: 'On December 20 last year, a house in the town was broken into and a number of items were stolen, including an iPad.

'It is thought the woman could have unwittingly bought the iPad from the people who stole it.'
