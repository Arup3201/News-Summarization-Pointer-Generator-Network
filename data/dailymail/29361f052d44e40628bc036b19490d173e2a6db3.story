The Queen came face-to-face with millions of portraits of herself today, as she visited a stamp factory in Wolverhampton. During the visit to International Security Printers, she was shown printing machines, as well as a stamp archive.

But Her Majesty, who was making her first visit to Wolverhampton since 1994, certainly didn't appear to mind and beamed as she was shown around the plant in the Midlands city's i54 business park.

Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh for the visit, the Queen, who was resplendent in a colourful turquoise ensemble, looked delighted by her welcome, smiling as she spotted a large crowd of well-wishers outside.

As they toured the business, the Queen was shown the printing machines at work before being taken to view a display of archived stamps and unveiling a plaque to commemorate the visit.

But the royal couple couldn't stay long and were whisked off for their second engagement of the day at the city's brand new Jaguar Land Rover factory which was recently completed at a cost of £500m and will create up to 1,400 jobs in the area.

The Queen, who formally opened the plant, toured the factory and was introduced to an excited group of local school children before being treated to a private lunch with the directors and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Although declared officially open today, the Jaguar Land Rover plant will not start full production until early 2015 - but has caused much excitement among locals and is the first new factory that the company has built from the ground up.

The facility will manufacture a new family of engines called Ingenium - the first engines to be entirely designed and built in-house by Jaguar Land Rover for exclusive use in the company’s future vehicles. 

The Queen is herself a fan of Jaguar Land Rover's vehicles and has often been photographed driving around the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire in a Land Rover.

Inner workings: The Queen looks on, clearly enjoying the visit, as she is shown a stamp cutting and finishing machine

Technology: The new factory will produce innovative new engines that will be used exclusively in Jaguar Land Rover cars

Clever: The Queen has the new engine parts explained to her by Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Dr Ralf Speth

 

But she has had little time for peaceful drives in recent weeks, thanks to a heavy schedule that included a reception for Victoria and George Cross holders at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday and a meeting with the Emir of Qatar yesterday.

The visit to Wolverhampton also marks the first time she has ventured outside London since returning from her annual summer holiday at Balmoral in September and her first visit to the Midlands for two years - the last being during the Diamond Jubilee tour.

It is not the first time the Midlands city has enjoyed a royal visit from a reigning queen, however. In 1866, Queen Victoria visited the city and was driven through the city in an open landau to Market Square (now called Queen Square), where she unveiled a statue of Prince Albert.

So impressed was the monarch with the event and the enthusiasm of the crowds, she stopped to knight the mayor, a man named John Morris, once the unveiling ceremony was complete.

Interest: Prince Philip, who has long had an interest in technology, is shown engine parts by director of manufacturing Wolfgang Stadler

Impressive: The brand new factory will begin production early next year, creating up to 1,400 jobs in Wolverhampton

Interested: The royal couple listened to company executives speak about the positive impact the factory is expected to have

Big opening: After officially opening the new factory, the Queen signed the visitor's book as the Duke of Edinburgh looked on

It has been named the fifth worst city in the world and was dubbed the least happy place to live in the Midlands, so why on Earth would the Queen want to pay a visit to Wolverhampton?

The answer is because it's brilliant. Today, for instance, the monarch is set to open a new Jaguar plant. Not only has her visit gotten locals talking, it’s set to create 1,400 jobs.

Those who hail from Wolverhampton like myself will know this is the best news we’ve had since Wolves got promoted to the Championship and local lad Liam Payne (the one from the Midlands who isn’t Harry Styles) landed a spot in One Direction.

And Wolverhampton has plenty to offer the Queen too. My advice? Stop by the Civic Hall to hear the dulcet tones of Beverley Knight, pop in at Katie Price’s hairdresser Royston Blythe for a perm and round off the day with a curry at The Bilash (the only Michelin rated restaurant we have to offer).

It might look grey from the outside but those of us who live there and love it know that Wolverhampton really is one of the best cities in the world.
