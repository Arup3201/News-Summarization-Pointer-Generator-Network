Lib Dem minister Norman Baker last night resigned from the Home Office, claiming working with Theresa May was like 'walking through mud'.

The maverick and conspiracy theorist claimed he could no longer work with the Home Secretary after the Tories blocked his report on decriminalising drugs.

But his decision to resign had been planned with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for months and timed to cause maximum damage to Mrs May, who is under pressure over her bungled handling of the government's child abuse inquiry.

Mr Baker will be replaced at the Home Office by the International Development minister Lynne Featherstone, who has previously worked under Mrs May.

Mr Baker used a newspaper interview to launch a stinging attack on Mrs May, accusing her of running the Home Office as a 'Conservative department in a Conservative government' and not part of the coalition.

He accused her of being 'soft on drugs' for refusing to bow to his demands for reform of the law to decriminalise possession of drugs and target dealers. 

It suggested he had taken the decision to resign after last week's public row over his report into drug laws around the world, which was suppressed for several months by the Conservatives.

However, Mr Baker struck a secret deal with Mr Clegg in August to resign from his post at the point which would cause maximum damage to Mrs May and her Conservative colleagues.

The Home Secretary was forced to eat humble pie in the Commons yesterday as she explained why not one but two people she had appointed to chair the inquiry into historic child abuse had been forced to resign.

She said sorry for the child sex abuse inquiry debacle and admitted the Government may have to look abroad for its third chairman.

The Home Secretary insisted the resignation of Fiona Woolf last week would not derail the inquiry, which will meet for the first time a week tomorrow without a chair – four months after it was announced.

Hours later, Mr Baker gave an interview in which he claimed Mrs May found it  'hard to accept' that he was the Lib Dem minister in her department, and he could no longer work with her.

Mr Baker, 57, will remain as MP for Lewes, where he is defending a majority of 7,647.

Theresa May remains the top choice as the next Tory leader among party members, a new survey showed today.

A quarter of members (24 per cent) surveyed by ConservativeHome back the Home Secretary, ahead of 22 per cent for Boris Johnson and Michael Gove on 11 per cent.

However, Mrs May has slipped in the league table of Cabinet ministers' performance, down one place to sixth.

It follows the ongoing problems with finding a chair for the child abuse inquiry and growing public unease about immigration.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is rated as the best performer, followed by Mr Gove, Chancellor George Osborne, Commons Leader William Hague and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. 

Tories retaliated, accusing him of behaving like a 'Liberal Democrat Home Secretary' despite being a middle-ranking minister. 

But Mr Baker told The Independent: 'They have looked upon it as a Conservative department in a Conservative government, whereas in my view it's a Coalition department in a Coalition government.

'That mindset has framed things, which means I have had to work very much harder to get things done even where they are what the Home Secretary agrees with and where it has been helpful for the Government and the department.

'There comes a point when you don't want to carry on walking through mud and you want to release yourself from that.'

In his resignation letter to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, Mr Baker wrote: 'I regret that in the Home Office, the goodwill to work collegiately to take forward rational evidence-based policy has been in somewhat short supply.'

Last night it was claimed Mr Clegg had tried to persuade him to stay. But Mr Baker had agreed in August the plan to stay in post until the opportunity presented itself to resign.

Mr Clegg has repeatedly clashed with Mrs May, most recently when she claimed the Lib Dems were putting children at risk by blocking the Communications Data Bill, which would give police access to a person's full internet history and who they have contact with on social media websites. 

Mr Baker spent three years as a transport minister when the coalition was formed, and was a surprise choice for the Home Office when he was appointed in October last year.

He wrote a book in 2007 claiming weapons inspector Dr David Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad, while the security services hushed it up.

He has also claimed the death of former foreign secretary Robin Cook was suspicious.

Mr Baker said Mrs May had found it 'hard to accept' when he was given the role, but he added: 'To be fair to the Home Secretary, I think she takes the view she has to keep a tight leash on everything otherwise she wouldn't carry on as Home Secretary – she has been there four-and-a-half years.

'I think she is quite competent and professional, and I have a lot of respect for her professionally.'

He added: 'I just think it's a pity that she took the mindset that the Lib Dems had to be put up with, and we were almost a cuckoo in the nest rather than part of government.'

However, the Tories accused Mr Baker, a keen musician who is about to release his second album, of over-inflating his importance in one of the biggest government departments.

Damian Green, a former Conservative immigration minister, said Mr Baker was like 'a guitarist who was only interested in his own solos while the rest of the band was trying to play a close harmony number'.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Norman's problem was that he came in and announced, he gave an interview to his local paper, saying 'I am the Lib Dem Home Secretary', he regarded himself as being on a par with the Home Secretary and asked for papers from other ministers. 

'He wanted to check what everyone else was doing. The world doesn't work like that. If you are a minister of state, in the end, you work to the secretary of state in that department.' 

Mr Baker sought to suggest the row over the drugs report was the final straw which forced his resignation.

When asked about his public row with Mrs May over drugs policy, he said: 'The phrase 'soft on drugs' is used. What is soft on drugs? I think being soft on drugs is pretending there isn't a problem, and this is being sorted.

'If anyone is soft on drugs it's my Conservative colleagues, because they are the ones who allow the process to go on whereby drug dealers continue to make money and people continue to get fined and carry on taking drugs.'

Mr Baker last week hailed a Home Office-commissioned report finding 'no obvious' link between tough laws and levels of illegal drug use.

He said the report meant the genie was out of the bottle and was not going back in. He said: 'I think the days of robotic, mindless rhetoric are over, because the facts and the evidence will no longer allow that.'

But he was slapped down my David Cameron, who said: 'I don't think anyone can read that report and say it definitely justifies this approach or that approach, but the evidence is what we're doing is working. 

'I don't believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today. I'm a parent with three children; I don't want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is OK or safe.'
