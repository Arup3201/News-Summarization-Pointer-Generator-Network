A fire chief appeared in court today charged with attempted murder after he broke into a female neighbor's home and assaulted her, authorities said.

Gary M. Swiercz, 49, allegedly climbed into the woman's house in the early hours of Saturday in a ski mask carrying a knife, duct tape, eight-inch sexual instrument and lubricant.

The deputy chief, from Tinley Park, Chicago has been held without bail after being charged with attempted murder, home invasion, 
aggravated unlawful restraint, aggravated attempted criminal sexual 
assault and residential burglary.

He is believed to have covered her mouth with his hand while she slept, then threatened to slash her throat before throwing her to the ground and beating her.

The victim fought back and the attacker fled the building while she dialed 911. Tinley police said that they found Swiercz in the parking lot where he was arrested.

The woman was treated for minor injuries including bruising to the face at her home.

He has been placed on administrative leave from the Chicago Ridge Fire Department following the alleged attack which his lawyer told the Chicago Tribune was out of character.

The fire chief appeared in Cook County Circuit Court today and was held on $150,000 bail.
