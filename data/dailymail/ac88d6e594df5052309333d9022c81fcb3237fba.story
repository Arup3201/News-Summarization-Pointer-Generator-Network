McLaren team principal Eric Boullier has hailed Kevin Magnussen's drive to claim a sole point in the Singapore Grand Prix as 'heroic'.

An overheating car beneath Magnussen resulted in the Dane's lower back sustaining minor burns, while the liquid in his fluids bottle boiled and became undrinkable.

At one stage during the safety car period Magnussen could be seen raising his arms outside of the cockpit, one at a time, in a bid to get cooling air behind him, but in temperatures of 28 degrees centigrade it was to no avail.

Despite the problems, Magnussen managed to cross the finishing line at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in 10th place to collect McLaren's only point as Jenson Button retired eight laps from home.

After being checked over at the track medical centre, Magnussen then lay on a towel filled with ice in order to relieve the pain.

Boullier said: 'It was a heroic performance. He really gave it his all.

'The afternoon was gruelling for him, there's no other word. He was subjected to severe bodily discomfort as his car's cockpit began to overheat.

'That necessitated his holding his arms aloft at one stage in an effort to direct cooling air down his sleeves and inside his race-suit, which was an unusually painful complication for him.

'In the end he was able to score a single point for the team. It was scant consolation, but it's indicative of his tremendous fighting spirit, and I commend him for it.'

Unsurprisingly, Magnussen claimed his result was 'the hardest point' he had ever earned.

The 21-year-old added: 'I don't know if something was wrong, but my seat was very hot which made things extremely uncomfortable for me, so we have to check what's going on.

'That was tough, very tough. I couldn't even drink the water, but at least we got one point. It's better than nothing.'
