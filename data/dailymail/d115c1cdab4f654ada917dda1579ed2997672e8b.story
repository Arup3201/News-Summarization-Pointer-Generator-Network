Jacob Rees-Mogg has come under fire for his mother's plans to build 19 new houses in the village of Hinton Blewett

A Tory MP has come under fire after his aristocratic mother unveiled plans to build a housing estate in the middle of a country village.

Residents in Hinton Blewett, Somerset, are outraged by Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg's plans to build 19 detached houses in the historic village.

Her Ladyship has been accused of taking advantage of a change in planning laws that allow local authorities to regulate applications for new buildings.

The family is well known in the village where former editor of The Times, Lord William Rees-Mogg was a Baron.

Jacob Rees-Mogg is the MP for North East Somerset, and lives in a neighbouring village.

Residents claim to have been on friendly terms with the family, but now say they are 'disappointed' with the plans.

Local farmer Graham Sage claims to have written to Lady Rees-Mogg personally to ask her to reconsider.

'I think people are feeling very disappointed and let down by this,' the 65-year-old said.

'It's totally inappropriate and I've never known them so upset about anything before.

'Even when the family moved they kept the Lord of the Manor title and 
there was always this great closeness between the Rees-Moggs and the 
people of Hinton Blewett.'

Consultants gave a lack of housing land as the reason behind a planning application for 19 detached homes shortly before Christmas.

Critics claim however the parish council has already found 15 individual, small building plots across the village which would be more suitable than an estate.

'There is no question about it, they are taking advantage of a narrow window of opportunity,' said Mr Sage.

The family is well known in the village after the MP's father (left) was named the Baron of Hinton Blewett in 1988

'Two years ago this application would have been laughed out because you'd have had a (hard) job to put a garden gate or wooden shed up in this village.

'It will be the same again when Banes gets its act together.'

Residents held the village's first ever public meeting to discuss the matter, while some have sent letters of objection to the plans which 'will spoil a very sensitive part of the Somerset countryside.'

One person who wished to remain anonymous said: 'People are not sure how Jacob feels about this but he's bound to have a foot in both camps because the land belongs to his mother.

'But her Ladyship might be in for a surprise. In the old days the Lord of the Manor could do what he wanted, but the peasants are educated now and are in revolt.'

Though the land is not green belt, it 
is situated next to a Nature Conservation area and includes the Cam 
Brook, a special landscape designation.Â 

Her Ladyship's planning consultants told
 villagers that she will discuss financial 
contributions towards improvements to highways and education or 
broadband if she gets planning permission.

Local farmer Graham Sage has said residents are disappointed with the plans which they feel could ruin the area's landscape

A local resident said: 'All planning is political and politically it would be convenient for Banes to grant permission for this development to help meet its housing targets, but for the residents of the village the application represents a money-making exercise by the owner of the land at the expense of the aspirations of others.'

Mr Rees-Mogg said: 'Planning is a matter for the local council and is not something that an MP has any say over.

'However, the green belt is a national policy designation which I strongly support and would oppose developments that threaten it.'

The MP's father, Lord William Rees-Mogg was the editor of The Times from 1967- 1981.

Following his death in 2012 the former columnist was described as 'a Fleet Street legend,' and 'distinguished public servant'.
