Olympiacos are interested in re-signing Fulham striker Kostas Mitroglou on loan.

The Greek international signed for Fulham for a club record £12million in January but has only started one game and the west London club are prepared to let him leave. 

Fulham would prefer to sell the striker but it is more likely that he will move back to his former club on a season-long loan.

Flop: Kostas Mitroglou has made just three appearances since his January switch to Craven Cottage 

Discussions have proved complicated so far and it is understood that Olympiacos want Fulham to pay some of the 26-year-old’s wages.

Mitroglou featured in all three of Greece’s World Cup group games in Brazil but failed to score and was dropped for the last-32 defeat to Costa Rica.

The striker was also left out of Fulham’s opening day Championship defeat to Ipswich last weekend.

Out of favour: Felix Magath has made it clear Mitroglou doesn't feature in his plans this season
