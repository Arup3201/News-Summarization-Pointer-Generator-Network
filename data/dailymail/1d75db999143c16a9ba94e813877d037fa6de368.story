The world's biggest and most advanced radio telescope, capable of detecting signs of extraterrestrial life in the far reaches of the universe, will be located in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.   

The decision to split the location of the $2 billion ‘Square Kilometre Array’ followed an intense battle between the bidders - South Africa one side and a joint bid from Australia and New Zealand on the other.   

Scanning the sky 10,000 times faster and with 50 times the sensitivity of any other telescope, it will be used to study the origins of the universe and will be able to detect weak signals that could indicate the presence of extraterrestrial life.   

Australia, New Zealand and South Africa will jointly host the largest ever radio telescope. It will have up to 50 times the sensitivity and 10,000 times the speed of current radio telescopes, say astronomers

Scientists leading the project rejected the suggestion that the decision, which will mean higher costs, meant science had taken a back seat to political expediency.   

‘We were all aware of the political dimensions of this,’ said Jon Womersley, Chair of the Board of Directors of the SKA organisation, but he added: ‘It's a scientifically motivated way forward.’   

There is already infrastructure in South Africa and Australia, including radio telescope dishes that were built as precursors to the new array. They will now be incorporated into the SKA.   

The consortium estimates that the decision to split the project will add about 10 percent to the 350 million euro ($440 million) budget for the first phase of construction.   

When completed in 2024 the telescope will be made up of 3,000 dishes, each 15 metres wide, together with many more antennae, that together will give a receiver surface area of a square kilometre.    

‘This hugely important step for the project allows us to progress the design and prepare for the construction phase of the telescope,’ said Michiel van Haarlem, Director General of the consortium.   

‘The SKA will transform our view of the universe; with it we will see back to the moments after the Big Bang and discover previously unexplored parts of the cosmos.’

To process the data coming back from the Square Kilometre Array, IBM is designing a computer which will digest twice as much information every day as the entire internet, sifting through radio waves from space in an effort to unravel the origin of the universe.

The machine will be attached to a 1,900 square mile array of telescope antenna, and will be built to 'suck in' in radio telescope data which will 'see' 13 billion years into the past, back to the dawn of the universe and the Big Bang.

The machine will be millions of times more powerful than the fastest PCs today - and will deal with 100 times more information than the output of the Large Hadron Collider.

The amount of data gathered by the Square Kilometre Array's dishes will be twice the traffic on the entire internet - and 100 times bigger than the output of the Large Hadron Collider

Ton Engbersen of IBM resarch says, 'If you take the current global daily Internet traffic and multiply it by two, you are in the range of the data set that the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope will be collecting every day.'

Upon completion in 2024, the telescope will be used to explore evolving galaxies, dark matter and even the very origins of the universe dating back more than 13 billion years.

IBM is to investigate using 3D 'stacks' of computer chips to achieve the enormous computing power required by the Square Kilometre Array.

This extremely powerful survey telescope will have millions of antennas to collect radio signals, forming a collection area equivalent to one square kilometre but spanning a huge surface area - approximately the width of the continental United States.

The SKA will be 50 times more sensitive than any former radio device and more than 10,000 times faster than today’s instruments.

The SKA is expected to produce a few Exabytes of data per day for a single beam per one square kilometer. After processing this data the expectation is that per year between 300 and 1500 Petabytes of data need to be stored.

In comparison, the approximately 15 Petabytes produced by the large hadron collider at CERN peryear of operation is approximately 10 to 100 times less than the envisioned capacity of SKA.

The directors of the Square Kilometre Array project are to meet in Amsterdam on 3 April to discuss the location of the huge telescope, scattered across 1,900 square miles of Earth's surface.

It will start building in 2016.

'It will have a deep impact on the way we perceive our place in the universe and how we understand its history and its future,' says Michiel van Haarlem, interim director general of the SKA project.'We know we are going to discover things.'

The SKA will consist of thousands of dishes across 1,900 miles, with a total surface area of one square kilometre, that will provide so much data that one astronomer has declared it will completely change our view of the universe.

Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, told MailOnline: ‘The SKA project will provide astronomers with a fantastic new tool which may well revolutionise our understanding of the universe.

‘With its huge area the telescope will show incredibly fine detail in galaxies, help test the theory of relativity by studying exciting and mysterious objects like black holes  and allow astronomers to learn more about the early history of the universe.'

The final location for the Square Kilometer Array has yet to be decided

The scientific community also believe that the SKA represents our best ever chance of finding out if there’s life beyond our solar system.

To do this will require ground-breaking technology. The SKA’s 15m-dishes, which will detect electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects in space, will be the most sensitive ever built - able to detect an airport radar on a planet 50 light years away.

These dishes will be complemented by low and medium frequency aperture arrays, which provide a large field of view and are capable of observing more than one part of the sky at once.

It will be carried on enough optical fibre cable of such quantity that it could be wrapped twice around the world.

As yet, a location for it hasn’t been decided, but Southern Africa and Australia are both n the reckoning.

They all offer areas with ideal conditions for telescopes, which must be well clear of electronic interference, such as that generated by mobile phones.

It’s hoped that construction will begin in 2016, with the dishes coming online eight years later.

A prototype of SKA called KAT-7, which consists of seven 16-metre dishes, is undergoing testing in South Africa's Karoo desert.
