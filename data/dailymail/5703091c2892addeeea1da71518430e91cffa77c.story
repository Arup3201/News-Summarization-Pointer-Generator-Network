The Arctic will turn green due to rising temperatures within decades, warns a new study.

The study forecasts that rising temperatures will lead to a massive 'greening' - increase in trees and shrubs - in the Arctic.

Scientists have revealed new models 
projecting that wooded areas in the Arctic could increase by as much as 
50 per cent over the next few decades.

The research shows that this dramatic greening will also accelerate climate warming at a rate greater than previously expected.

Lead author Richard Pearson, a research scientist at the American Museum of Natural History's Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation, said: 'Such widespread redistribution of Arctic vegetation would have impacts that reverberate through the global ecosystem.'

Plant growth in Arctic ecosystems has increased over the past few decades, a trend that coincides with increases in temperatures, which are rising at about twice the global rate. 

The research team - which includes scientists from the Museum, the University of York, AT&T Labs-Research, Woods Hole Research Centre, Colgate University and Cornell University - used climate scenarios for the 2050s to explore how the trend is likely to continue in the future.

The scientists developed models that statistically predict the types of plants that could grow under certain temperatures and precipitation. Although it comes with some uncertainty, the researchers said such modelling is a 'robust' way to study the Arctic because the harsh climate limits the range of plants that can grow, making this system simpler to model compared to other regions such as the tropics.

The models reveal the potential for massive redistribution of vegetation across the Arctic under future climate, with about half of all vegetation switching to a different class and a massive increase in tree cover. For example, in Siberia trees could grow hundreds of miles north of the present tree line.

Doctor Pearson said: 'These impacts would extend far beyond the Arctic region. 

'For example, some species of birds seasonally migrate from lower latitudes and rely on finding particular polar habitats, such as open space for ground-nesting.'

The researchers also investigated the multiple climate change feedbacks that greening would produce. They found that a phenomenon called the albedo effect, based on the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, would have the greatest impact on the Arctic's climate. 

When the sun hits snow, most of the radiation is reflected back to space. But when it hits an area that's 'dark' - covered in trees or shrubs - more sunlight is absorbed in the area and temperature increases. This increases climate warming as the more vegetation there is, the more warming will occur.

Co-author Scott Goetz, of the Woods Hole Research Centre, added: 'By incorporating observed relationships between plants and albedo, we show that vegetation distribution shifts will result in an overall positive feedback to climate that is likely to cause greater warming than has previously been predicted.'

The findings were published in the journal Nature Climate Change.
