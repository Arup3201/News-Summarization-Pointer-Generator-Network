He risked his life by running across open ground in front of an enemy sniper to save a fallen comrade on an Afghan battlefield.

And now a young soldier, who was shot in the head while carrying out the courageous rescue in Helmand province, has received a Military Cross in recognition of his bravery.

Lance Corporal Matthew Wilson, 21, of Aberystwyth, who serves with 2nd Battalion The Rifles, deliberately put himself into the cross hairs of a Taliban sniper after a fellow soldier was shot in the leg.

His unit had been on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines in Nahr-e Saraj when they came under enemy fire.

By drawing the sniper's attention, L/Cpl Wilson won time for a helicopter to fly in and rescue the injured soldier.

But his bravery almost cost him his own life, when a bullet struck his helmet, knocking him out. His horrified comrades feared L/Cpl Wilson was dead.

A few seconds later they watched in astonishment as he groggily got to his feet, sprinted 50 yards across open ground and began returning fire at the insurgent.

Incredibly, the round had deflected off the soldier’s helmet – saving his life, and leaving him with nothing worse than a ‘massive headache’.

His selfless actions allowed a helicopter to land and fly his stricken colleague, who had been shot in the leg, to safety.

L/Cpl
Wilson, who is now based in Northern Ireland, was one of three soldiers
from 2 Rifles to be awarded with the Military Cross for 'exemplary 
gallantry' yesterday at Buckingham Palace. The award is the UK’s second highest honour for valour.

He
is among 107 servicemen and women who received awards in the 
operational honours list. Most of the honours go to troops who fought 
with 20 Armoured Brigade in Afghanistan in the six months from October 
2011.

His citation said he displayed ‘exceptional gallantry and leadership...with complete disregard for his own safety’.

L/Cpl Wilson told how he cheated death
, during a reconnaissance mission last autumn. His unit was pinned down
in an ambush more than a mile behind enemy lines.

He said: ‘I heard a loud crack and 
then woke up on the floor. Everything was a bit blurry and a massive 
headache. The lads behind me thought I’d been killed.’

Lance Corporal Wilson said he did not think he was in any real danger when he made the decision to save his comrade.

'Stuff like this happens every day,' 
he told the Telegraph, 'I was just lucky to be recognised and I am proud
but really this award is for everybody.'
