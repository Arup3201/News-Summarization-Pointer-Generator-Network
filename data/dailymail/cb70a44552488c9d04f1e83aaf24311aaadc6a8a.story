Cristiano Ronaldo almost left Cardiff with two UEFA Super Cup medals in tow after Michel Platini tried to hang a second around his neck.

The forward, who scored both goals as Real Madrid triumped 2-0 over Sevilla at the Cardiff City Stadium on Tuesday, had already been presented with his medal when he arrived at the UEFA president.

Platini did not realise at first, however, and went to put another medal around his neck on the concourse in the stands where the ceremony was taking place.
