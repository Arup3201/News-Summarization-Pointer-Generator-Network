Convicted murderer: Steven Pratt, 45, was just out of prison when he allegedly clubbed his mom to death

A convicted murderer who had just been released after spending 30 years in prison stands accused of clubbing his own mother to death on his second day of freedom.

Steven Pratt, 45, killed 64-year-old Gwendolyn Pratt during an argument at her home in Atlantic City, New Jersey, prosecutors said.

Police found Mrs Pratt dead from head injuries to her head at 6.30am Sunday. Pratt had got out of jail Friday.

The Pratt family had just held a welcome-back party to celebrate the end of the 30-year jail sentence, imposed for killing a neighbor with a handgun, the Press of Atlantic City reported. 

An autopsy found that Mrs Pratt had died from massive trauma to the head.

Ruan Tilghman Pugh, who lives next door, told the paper: 'It's so devastating. You just never know what people are going through.'

He said that before the alleged attack he had overheard Pratt on the phone to a cousin, asking to stay with him in the wake of an argument with his aunt, who was staying for the weekend.

Police arrested Pratt at the scene and charged him with murder. He is being held on a $1million bail in Atlantic County Jail. It is unclear whether he has retained an attorney.

Pratt had just served his 30-year sentence for the murder of Michael Anderson, a neighbor in Atlantic City whom he shot dead in 1984.

Pratt, then aged 15, was hanging around in an apartment hallway when he got into an argument with Mr Anderson, court records state. He was tried as an adult.

After the confrontation, Pratt attacked Mr Anderson with a lead pipe, but Mr Anderspn disarmed him and hit him back.

Pratt came back with a borrowed handgun and killed Mr Anderson.
