John Collins has urged Celtic to grant Ronny Deila time to deliver his Parkhead blueprint.

The Norwegian has endured a troubled start to life in Scottish football, with Aberdeen top of the Premiership by a single point.

Speaking as the Scottish champions began a winter training break in Gran Canaria, assistant manager Collins called for patience and backed Deila to deliver an attractive, winning team.

‘We want to build an attacking team that scores goals and plays at a high tempo, creates chances, one-twos, phases of play,’ he said.

‘But it’s not just a case of pushing a button and that’s what happens. It takes time.

‘There are obstacles and setbacks along the way. But, if we all stick to our principles, we will get there.’

Four points adrift before Monday night’s clash with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, the champions reduced the deficit with a strong performance in a 2-0 victory.

Some have questioned the timing of Celtic’s decision to exercise their option to take a one-game break and spend the week in the Canaries, but Collins is not concerned with the team’s league position. He insists that performance is as important to the management as points.

‘People analyse results — and the results haven’t been great,’ he admitted.

‘There have been periods in games where we have created so many chances, but not taken them.

‘We analyse the performance. We need to win games to stay in the job and keep people happy. But we are both development coaches — not just results coaches.

‘If we play badly and win 3-0, we look at each other and say the same thing — we are not quite happy.

‘We are not fulfilled and that’s not going to change — it’s just the way we are.

‘We want to see performances, we want to see the players develop.’

Conceding that supporters will show little understanding or patience if the league title is in doubt going into the last two months of the season, Collins added: ‘We are not going to change the supporters.

Collins says Deila deserves more time to make his mark at Parkhead

‘But we want to win and we want to win in a certain way — we do not want to win ugly.’

The 46-year-old, meanwhile, has delivered a stinging putdown to Michael Stewart after the Sportscene analyst used an online podcast to criticise Collins — his boss at Hibernian between 2006 and 2007.

Stewart, who was one of the alleged ringleaders in an Easter Road player rebellion against the coach, claimed last week: ‘Collins had a great career and was a great player — and within five minutes he’d lost the Hibs dressing room because of his demeanour and stature.’

Asked to comment, Collins deadpanned: ‘Michael who? Michael won’t be saying anything nice about me. I left him out of a Cup Final. That’s all I’ve got to say.’
