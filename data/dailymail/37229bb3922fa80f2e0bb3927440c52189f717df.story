Slow zone: Conservative MEPs rubbished the suggestion that all EU states should agree to the 20mph limit in residential areas

European Union plans to enforce a mandatory 20mph speed limit in residential zones and replace the Highway Code with European law has sparked outrage from British politicians.

Conservative Members of the European Parliament last night slammed the suggestion to decrease the limit as 'silly'.

Dozens of road safety suggestions were endorsed thanks to a show of hands by MEPs.

They voted on a report drawn up by centre-right MEP Dieter-Lebrecht Koch, whose resolution on behalf of the Parliament's Transport Committee includes the introduction of a 30km speed limit in residential areas.

This would include single lane roads in urban areas which have no separate cycle lane, 'with a view to protecting vulnerable road users more effectively'.

The proposed limit equates to 18.6mph and is just one of a raft of recommendations which also include harmonised road traffic rules, road signs, road worthiness tests and blood alcohol limits.

Ironically, Mr Koch is from Germany, the European country which decades ago warned it would never tolerate interference in its right to have motorways with no speed limits.

And although today's proposal is only an 'own initiative' report and unlikely to see the light of legislative day, Tory MEP for the North West and transport spokesman Jacqueline Foster said it was 'another example of Europe trying to dictate to Britain on issues that should be decided locally'.

Tory MEP Jacqueline Foster (left) attacked the proposals as 'plain silly'. German MEP Dieter-Lebrecht Koch (right), who put forward the report, believes that his recommendations will halve road deaths by 2020

She said: 'Of course speed limits as 
low as 20mph or so can be right in some very specific areas, especially 
near schools or nurseries, but every location is different and these 
decisions need to be made case by case.

'Not by a Europe-wide edict.'

A British road sign declaring 'Speed limit - 18.64mph' would be 'plain silly' she said.

Other ideas among more than 100 from Mr Koch include standardised road signs across the EU, harmonised road worthiness standards for cars, a common drink-driving limit and a standard 'highway code' for all member states.

Mr Koch, whose report is a response to a European Commission discussion paper last year on road safety, says his combined measures could halve road accident deaths by 2020 - and help towards his ultimate target of a 'zero death toll' on Europe's roads.

'The choice of measures and their assessment should be a scientific process, based on comparable, high-quality data, definitions and statistics,' said Mr Koch during the debate on his report.

'We expect a harmonised analysis of the causes of accidents and injuries and an EU-wide exchange of data which respects a high standard of data privacy.'
