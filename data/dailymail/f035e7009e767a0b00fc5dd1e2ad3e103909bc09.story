After more than 30 years behind the lens, award-winning wildlife photographer Paul Souders decided to let someone - or rather something - else do most of the hard work for him. 

The 53-year-old American snapper has traveled to every conceivable corner of the world in his quest to capture animals in their natural habitat, but for his latest shoot Paul put decided to put his feet up and put his trust in a drone.

Paul traveled 10,000 miles from his home in Seattle to  Chobe National Park in Botswana for the shoot, which he took using his DJI Phantom Vision 2+drone operated via a hand-held remote control.

Wildebeest, elephants, lions, elephants and giraffes are among some of the species captured on film during the unusual shoot, with mesmerising results.

A heard of wildebeest can be seen fleeing the scene as the drone hovers overhead, while in another shot, a lone giraffe appears fascinated by the device.

In 2013, Paul was the Grand Prize and Nature winner of the National Geographic Photography Contest with a stunning photograph of a polar bear peering up from beneath the melting sea ice on Hudson Bay.

Speaking to the magazine, Paul explained that he fell into wildlife photography almost by accident: 'I never set out to be a nature photographer, I wanted to be a news shooter, and I started my first job at a small daily paper in Rockville with dreams of journalistic glory. 

'I covered a lot of high school sports, portrait assignments and weather features. It felt like telling the story of my community, one day at a time. At some point, I decided a change of scene was in order. 

'Never one for half measures, I packed up everything I owned and drove 4300 miles to Anchorage, Alaska, to take a job at the state’s biggest newspaper. It was 27 below zero the day I arrived, but it was entirely new and magical. There was a moose in my backyard and I could see bald eagles on my morning commute.'
