A little girl, 8, suffering from a neurological disorder wrote a heartwarming letter to an injured police offer who was shot in the chest.

Abby Holbrook, of Loveland, Colorado sent local police officer Garret Osilka a letter to make him feel better after he was shot during a March traffic stop.

Abby suffers from an autoimmune condition similar to multiple sclerosis called transverse myeliti. At one point in her sickness, she was paralyzed from the neck down.

Abby Holbrook and Officer Garrett Osilka met after Holbrook, who suffers from a disease, wrote him a heart warming letter telling him he will heal after being shot

Though Abby did not know Osilka personally before reaching out to him, 'She wanted to give him a gift,' mother Carrie Holbrook said.

Abby sent Osilka a St. Christopher medal along with the letter.

'Dear Officer Osilka, I know how it feels to hurt really bad. I'm in the hospital, and Chief Hecker is my friend, so that makes you my friend. I hope you feel better soon. I got this medal because St. Christopher will help protect you from bad guys. Love, Abby,' said the letter.

9News reports that Abby goes to the hospital for brain surgeries often and that gifts always make her feel a little bit better.

In addition to painful brain surgeries, Abby must undergo bladder surgeries and has one scheduled for next week.

Loveland Police Chief Luke Hecker, referenced in the letter, is a family friend of the Holbrooks, the station adds. Hecker even delivered the gifts to Osilka on Abby's behalf and told him about Abby's condition. Osilka asked if he could visit Abby, which he later did.

This is Abby Holbrook's inspiring letter to Officer Osilka telling him that St.Christopher will protect him and that she's in the hospital so she knows what it is like to feel pain

Abby's mom Carrie Holbrook believes this will be the beginning of a long and special friendship for her daughter and injured officer Garret Osilka

'It was very, very sweet,' Carrie Holbrook said told the station.

Holbrook believes that this will be the beginning of a very long and special friendship.

'It was a super, special letter obviously,' Osilka told 9News. 'That's why I wanted to come see you afterwards.'

Osilka is currently healing from his injuries, which include both the gunshot wound as well as psychological trauma.

The 'bad guy' Abby refers to in her letter, who police suspect is 23-year-old Cody Powell, was charged with suspicion of attempted first-degree murder in early March.

He was arrested after police linked a vehicle, either a blue or black Jeep Cherokee with temporary plates occupied by two people to the scene of the crime, Westword.com reports. Powell turned himself in at a Loveland Walmart.

Osilka told 9news that even though he suffered an injury while on his sometimes frightening job, he believes that Abby is even stronger than he is.

'I kind of picked my profession,' he said.

'It's not a choice that she made. In my mind, she's tougher than I am.'
