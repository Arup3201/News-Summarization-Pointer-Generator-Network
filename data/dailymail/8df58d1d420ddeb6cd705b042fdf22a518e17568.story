The woman suing Casey Anthony for defamation, was arrested for allegedly
selling Four Loko to a minor.

Zenaida Gonzalez, who was referred to as Zanny the Nanny in Anthony’s murder
trial, works as a cashier at a Circle K convenience store in Orange County,
Florida.

Police say she sold a 23.5 ounce can, costing $2.98, of the alcoholic power
drink to an 18-year-old, even after Gonzalez had looked at the teenager’s ID
card and saw the customer was underage.

The 41-year-old  was arrested Friday
evening by the Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, as part of
a sting operation to catch retail clerks selling alcohol to customers under 21,
order to the Orlando Sentinel.

The alcoholic beverage, labeled as an energy
drink, comes in a variety of fruity flavors and its manufacturer, Phusion
Project, has been criticized for marketing the drink to younger consumers. 

The ‘Four’ in the brand name refers to the mixture’s main ingredients: alcohol,
caffeine,
taurine,
regularly found in energy drinks, and guarana, a highly
caffeinated plant extract.

But in 2010 the FDA forced the makers to remove the caffeinated portions from the mixture sold in the U.S., citing its danger to consumers. The reformulated drink was re-released in 2011.

Gonzalez faces one charge of selling or giving liquor to someone younger
than 21. She was released from jail on Saturday after posting $250 bail.

Gonzalez gained notoriety when Casey Anthony, who was found not-guilty in the
death of her two-year-old daughter Caylee, claimed Gonzalez had kidnapped the
toddler when the girl was reported missing and investigators launched a massive search that gained notoriety nationwide.

Caylee disappeared in Orlando, Florida, in the summer of 2008, and
her mother concocted a bizarre tale that implicated Gonzalez, though she had
never even met Casey Anthony or any members of the Anthony family.

After months of searching for the 
little girl, Caylee Anthony’s remains were found by investigators near 
Anthony’s home on December
11, 2008.

Casey Anthony was charged with first degree murder
but found not guilty, in a highly publicized trial that lasted from June to
July 2011.

She was found guilty on four misdemeanor counts of providing false
information to a law enforcement officer, for fabricating information about her
connection to Gonzalez, in addition to falsely telling police that she was
employed at Universal Studios.

Gonzalez has filed a defamation suit against Anthony, alleging that the
mother willfully damaged her reputation.

She claims she has suffered a loss of
employment, was evicted from her home and even received death threats after
Anthony dropped her name in discussions with investigators searching for Caylee.

Gonzalez is seeking compensatory and punitive damages and the case is expected to
go to trial in January 2013.
