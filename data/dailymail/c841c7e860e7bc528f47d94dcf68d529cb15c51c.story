An anxious wait lies in store for Michel Vorm. After his calamitous mistake gifted Leicester a passage to the FA Cup fifth round, Mauricio Pochettino could be forgiven for calling on Hugo Lloris to step in when Tottenham arrive at Sheffield United on Wednesday.

The Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Bramall Lane is his most important game yet as manager. Spurs haven't won any silverware for seven years and Pochettino knows a night in Yorkshire is set to be tricky enough without the potential for any self-inflicted pain.

He will have watched Vorm allow a tepid stoppage-time Jeffrey Schlupp volley bobble over him and wonder whether it's worth risking not starting with Lloris.

The Frenchman is rivalled only by David de Gea as the Premier League's best between the sticks. With that in mind, Pochettino's decision seems clearcut.

Vorm was actually lucky to still be on the pitch at the time of his howler after referee Robert Madley ludicrously felt Andrej Kramaric had dived when clearly fouled in the box.

Regardless, Vorm wants an opportunity to make amends.

'I don't play that much so these kind of games are very important,' he admitted. 'I said sorry to the boys but they were 'Don't be silly, you did very well'. But you feel a responsibility.

'To be honest they did not say to me that you will be playing in the FA Cup and Capital One Cup, I just hear it the day before a game. But I hope they still give me the chance to play on Wednesday.

'It is hard and Sheffield will play the game of their lives probably. If we don' t understand the importance of the game for the club and fans then we don't deserve it. But we will. I am 100 per cent sure we will.'

The ramifications of the gaffe, however, are likely to linger for Vorm — even if he is given the nod.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino must decide whether to continue with Vorm against Sheffield United

'It will (play on my mind) but you have to go on,' he added. 'I am 31 and I have dealt with worse. That is part of the life. Iker Casillas makes mistakes, so why couldn't I?'

One man who didn't fluff his lines was Leonardo Ulloa, who brilliantly equalised for the Foxes and is now gearing himself up for a first trip to Old Trafford on Saturday.

Manchester United hold no fears for Nigel Pearson's side, the striker argues. Doing the double against Louis van Gaal's Reds is not beyond the realms of possibility — particularly after this sure-footed performance at White Hart Lane.

'We need to play with the same intensity. We must play strong because we know they take the ball always but we must defend well and use the counter attack,' Ulloa said. 'They are not as good as in the past seasons but we must press more there.

'Now against Manchester United we believe we have a chance because we always create chances and we created many chances against Tottenham.'

Ulloa is right. Leicester saw opportunities come and go before they finally dumped Pochettino's Spurs out of the Cup.

For a delighted Pearson, it is that attacking ingenuity which will prove key if they are to back up the shock 5-3 win earlier in the season.

'They are the games we've been aspiring to play for a decade,' he said. 'There' s no point in being anything other than positive and look forward to them.

'It's not exactly a straightforward one, but I think we've shown here and places like Liverpool that we can be a threat.'
