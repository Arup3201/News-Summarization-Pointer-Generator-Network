Los Angeles Clippers center Spencer Hawes sat out during Thursday's game against the Golden State Warriors due to an injury but he still managed to bring a heaping dose of holiday cheer and to honor a dear friend.

Hawes marched into the NBA showdown on Christmas Day at wearing a red and green suit adorned with Christmas trees and a snazzy tie to match to pay tribute to legendary side-line reporter Craig Sager who is battling leukemia.

Hawes, who stands over 7-feet, may have been taller than some Christmas trees on Thursday and certainly gave an always dapper Sager a run for his money.

Hawes says his wardrobe decision was a tribute to Sager who is known for wearing outrageous and colorful outfits on the court. 

'Mr. Sager do you approve? Merry Christmas!,' tweeted Dawes at Sager.

Hawes wanted to honor the reporter who has been been battling acute myeloid leukemia since April, creating an absence at the sidelines felt around the league, reports The New York Daily News. 

Sager has showed signs of improvement in his recovery, perhaps due to the love and support from his basketball family.  

The Clippers won the game on Thursday 100-86 and though Hawes was merely on the bench, his holiday spirit may have helped amp up his team.
