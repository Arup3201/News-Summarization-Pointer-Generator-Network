Victim: Christopher Foster is believed to have been stabbed to death in a case of mistaken identity

A father who became the unintended victim of a gangland stabbing 'didn’t have an enemy in the world', friends said today.

Chris Foster, 34, was attacked without warning as he smoked a cigarette with a friend outside a pub in Borough, London.

Murder squad detectives believe he was mistaken for someone else by up to seven armed youths who were seen running away.

The law firm administrative
 clerk, who had a four-year-old daughter, suffered catastrophic internal
 injuries and died an hour later in hospital.

Since the tragedy on Friday, tributes have been flooding in for the father.

Laying flowers at the scene of the murder, devastated friends of Mr Foster paid tribute said he was a 'proper gentleman' murdered while out for a 'Christmas drink.'

One childhood friend who asked not to be identified said: 'His family are devastated, his daughter is devastated.

'There wasn’t a nicer or more genuine guy in the world.

'The geezer didn’t have one enemy in the world. It’s a complete case of mistaken identity.

'He was the most genuine, nicest person you could have met.'

Dozens of friends met in a nearby pub to remember their friend on Saturday as news of his death spread through social media, she added.

'Christopher was always popular, the funniest bloke who would never have caused harm to anyone and never had any arguments in his life.

'When we heard the news on Saturday we met at a pub nearby as it sunk in.

In memory: Scores of flowers and tributes have been left for Mr Foster near to the scene

'Within no time there were more than thirty people there who knew him and had found out over social media. It amazes me so many people came together.

'It happened in outside St Christopher’s Inn and his name was Christopher, it’s ridiculous.'

Another added: 'It’s really worrying, that you could be walking down the road and get stabbed. It could happen to anyone.'

The murder took place outside the packed St Christopher’s Inn in Borough, south London.

Mr Foster had gone into an alley to have a cigarette when he was stabbed fatally from behind with no warning shortly before midnight.

Investigators believe his attackers may have been circling the area looking for another man to target, but they do not know why.

Within moments, the gang ran off towards a nearby housing estate, making use of several back streets and alleys.

Mr Foster was rushed to the Royal London Hospital, in East London, but died just over an hour later.

Crime: Mr Foster was outside the pub having a cigarette when he was attacked

Detective
 Chief Inspector John Sandlin, who is leading the inquiry, said that the
 victim was ‘entirely innocent’.

He said: ‘We believe this was a case 
of mistaken identity. He was out with his friends, minding his own 
business. Chris was 
standing there chatting with a friend when seven people come up the 
alley and one of them stabs him in the back.

'Almost immediately five 
carry on and two double back, there is a commotion and it appears they 
have gone after someone else at the end of the alley.

'This was an 
innocent guy doing what most of us are doing on a Friday night, 
socialising with friends.

‘It
 is a cowardly attack, made even more tragic by the fact there is a 
four-year-old girl who has lost her dad.’

The senior officer said Mr 
Foster was not struck with a baseball bat and no knives had been 
recovered from the scene.

He added: ‘We don’t know anything more than that they were hooded and carrying weapons, some may have been female.

‘A group of bystanders who were also out in the alleyway smoking administered first aid to Chris before the paramedics arrived.

‘At that time on a Friday night there will have been a lot of people in the area, someone must have seen something.’

Tribute: One of the emotional messages left for the victim near to the south London crime scene

'Gone too soon': Another message pays tribute to Mr Foster, saying he was a 'great dad'

In
 recent years the maze of streets around trendy Borough Market, close to
 the River Thames, has become a popular evening destination for young 
professionals.

But it is a short walk from some of the capital’s toughest estates.

Today colleagues at international law firm Pinsent Masons where Mr Foster worked for six years as a facilities assistant paid tribute to the 'very popular' worker.

Martin Roberts, Head of Pinsent Masons’ London office, said: 'Everyone at the firm was shocked and saddened to hear this news.

'Chris was a very popular member of staff and we are doing all that we can to support his family and colleagues at this difficult time.'

A Facebook page RIP Chris Foster was set up by friend Lee Sefton for friends to post thought and comments about their friend nicknamed 'Chicken.'

On Saturday night he wrote: 'RIP to Chris foster an absolute true gentleman and someone that I will never forget the scummy cowardly c***s that did this to you mate are gonna pay and this I promise with all my heart you sleep with the angels now mate and party on.'

Sadness: Police believe Mr Foster, a tribute to the father pictured, was killed in a case of mistaken identity

Mr Sefton added: 'A great young man, a great dad and an amazing friend whose smile and laugh will be missed by many.'

Louise Ward wrote: 'Another young life taken too soon. Sleep tight Chris Rip 3 x'

Estelle O’Brien said: 'Still in total shock, such a lovely funny bloke, nursery, primary, secondary, all the Old Kent Road days.

'Never forget all our crazy nights in the Frog, u cutting one on the dance floor with the crazy chicken dance. R.I.P mate.'

Roly Cater wrote: 'Shocked lost touch with Chris a few years back but my memories were always fond good laugh fun guy RIP my thoughts are firmly with his family.'

Nichole Clarke said: 'So sad & unfair. My thoughts are with Chris’s family! R.I.P God Bless!'

Those who knew Chris also posted tributes on Twitter, angry that he had been caught up in gang violence.

RIP: Around 40 bunches of flowers have been left outside the pub today - which is close to one of London's toughest estates

Jess Dunphy wrote: 'I can’t believe you have been taken Chris Foster in such an awful way, it makes me feel sick.'

Another, Paul Fiander wrote: 'I wish I had the vocabulary to express how much the loss of an old friend has shaken me. But instead I’m failing. R.I.P Chris Foster.'

Around 40 bouquets of 
flowers had also been left near to the scene.

Speaking about the 
victim, who was one of three brothers, Neil and Hayley McGovern said: 
‘He was a great guy, he would never fight.’

One
 tribute said: ‘You were an amazing guy, our brother and devoted father,
 we love you so much, you were always there to help us, cared and loved 
us. You have brought up an amazing daughter who will be so proud of 
you.’

Last night the alley remained sealed off as forensic teams carried out a fingertip search for evidence.

A 32-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender was being held at an east London police station.
