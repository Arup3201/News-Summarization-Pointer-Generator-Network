A man was up in flames after dousing himself and his car in petrol in the middle of a freeway during peak hour traffic in Brisbane.

The man, whose age is yet to be released, was said to be threatening to set himself on fire for half an hour as emergency service workers attempted to defuse the situation on the Pacific Motorway in Brisbane’s inner south on Wednesday night.

At about 6.20pm at Holland Park, the man poured petrol over himself and his car and set it alight but the emergency service staff at the scene managed to quickly extinguished the fire.

The alarming incident caused the closure of all southbound lanes and the traffic came to a complete standstill for several kilometres past the city to Coronation Drive during the height of the peak hour period.

The man was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital and miraculously survived with only minor burns.

Although the freeway was only closed for 15 minutes, police urged motorists to consider alternative routes as there was residual traffic and long delays.
