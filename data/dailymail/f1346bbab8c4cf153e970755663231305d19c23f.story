A man's unique charity challenge has become a selfie sensation after he successful spent the month of September taking photos with complete strangers.

He has taken selfies with Power Rangers outside Buckingham Palace, posed thousands of feet in the air above France and he even gatecrashed a couples wedding photos in Benidorm.

Paul Barnes, 35, from Bolton, Lancashire, has finished his 'Stranger Selfie September' challenge after coming up with the idea to raise money for Cancer Research.

He said: 'The best moments along the way were seeing the reactions of a person after you interrupt their day.

Paul Barnes, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said the favourite part of his Stranger Selfie September was interrupting a Spanish wedding (above)

'The initial reaction is a kind of 'what do you want, why are you talking to me, is this a scam, do you want money from me, I don't even know you'. But as soon as they realise all I want is a photo, and the pressure of donation is totally up to them at a later stage, their face changes completely.'

His idea to take photos of complete stranger not only helped him meet a whole host of people but it also raised awareness of the charity, as well as having a huge amount of fun.

 'My favourite moment was interrupting a Spanish wedding as not only did I manage it, I broke the language barrier,' said Mr Barnes.

'Excuse me, I said, can I have a photo with you please? The groom looked confused, but the bride said 'Ce Ce', then when I got my phone out and got myself into the shot the groom remarked 'Ahhh 'Selfie'. It was such a great moment.'

Mr Barnes has his fair few ups and downs during the challenge and admits it was a struggle at times to approach people, with his main regret of missing out on a selfie with former England football star David Platt.

He added: 'It takes a lot to go up to a complete stranger, and interrupt their day and then to ask for a photo. Some people just don't want to be bothered and would rather go about their day and some just plain don't like their photo being taken.

 'It really knocks the stuffing out of you when you are refused a selfie, but each time it has happened I just think about the reason I am doing this and soldier My mum has had breast cancer and other family members have also been through some very tough times, We have lost close friends and family so this was the reason behind choosing Cancer Research.'

Mr Barnes hoped on raising just £200 through the challenge, but ended up with almost £500, which is a figure that is still rising.

Mr Barnes is taking a selfie with at least one stranger every single day, or in this case, several during a hen do

'I did think the idea had potential, but I am a little overwhelmed at just how well it has all gone,' Mr Barnes, following his idea which has inspired others to take part in the challenge for there chosen charity.

'After the first couple of days, I had discussed all kinds of charities with different people. Lucy Openshaw, raising for mental health charity Mind, and Sara Patel, for Papyrus, which help with the prevention of young suicides, both approached me stating that they wished they had thought of the idea.

'It was then that I asked them to set up their own 'Just Giving' page then join the Selfie teams page. This was exactly the reaction I wanted and still hope others will join us and we can all raise money together but for our own causes at the same time. '

Together the group raised around £1000 for their chosen charities as they hope to start a 'chain reaction' of people looking to take up the challenge for a month.

Mr Barnes and his team will also be holding a 'super selfie session' to official end their month long challenge at a Tesco Extra in Bolton on Sunday, October 12, taking as many snaps with strangers as possible.
