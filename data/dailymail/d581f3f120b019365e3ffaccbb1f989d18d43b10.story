A baby Prince Charles was 'fascinated' by his newborn sister Princess Anne, according to a rare letter written by the Queen just days after the birth.

Less than two years old at the time, Charles treated Anne with 'great care', the Queen wrote to her friend Mrs Tanner.

She also wrote that 'it will be fun when they are able to play together'.

Now, the two page letter giving a glimpse into the rarely seen family life of the royals will go on sale for £600, 64 years after it was written.

In the letter, which offers an insight into the Queen's life as a young mother, she thanks her correspondent for the good wishes upon the 'arrival of our daughter'.

Continuing, she writes: 'The baby is quite unlike her brother, so it will 
be interesting to see whom she will take after when she is older.'

Written in fountain pen, it is dated 3 September, 1950 - just 19 days after Anne's arrival on August 15.

The letter came from Clarence House where the Queen lived with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, before she became queen two years later.

The letter is accompanied by two unsigned vintage Press photographs of the young Prince Charles and Princess Anne in different poses in the gardens of the Royal Lodge in Windsor.

Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions which is selling the item, said it was rare to find a letter of this nature written by Her Majesty.

Davie said: 'Charles is clearly quite fond of his sibling and he appears to be a really sweet child.'

He further revealed that it is unusual for a letter like to come up for auction as most people hang on to their letters from the Queen.

'The Queen has been a prolific letter writer over the years but most recipients have kept their letter.

'Most letters are not going to be of this nature and it highlights really well the Queen's maternal instincts, which makes it an interesting read.

Davie said that although he was unsure of what the receipent, Mrs. Tanner's, relation to the Queen was, he could make a few assumptions.

'I don't know who Mrs Tanner is but she lived in Windsor judging by the envelope which came with the letter.

'She may have been part of the Royal household because she appears on close terms with the Queen.

Charles and Anne have remained close throughout adulthood too, and are members of the Order of the Garter

The letter goes under the hammer with International Autograph Auctions at the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel in Heathrow, London, tomorrow, 15 February.
