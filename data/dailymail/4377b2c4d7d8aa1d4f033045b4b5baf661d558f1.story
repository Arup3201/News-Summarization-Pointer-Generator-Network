Despite surrendering a lead seven minutes into stoppage time against Liverpool, the Arsenal players seemed in good spirits as they enjoyed another Christmas party on Monday.

Martin Skrtel's 97th-minute equaliser at Anfield means the Gunners will be tucking into their Christmas turkey on Thursday having missed out on what would have been a vital three Premier League points.

But the players appeared to have put that disappointment behind them as members of the squad took to social media to share pictures of the festive soiree.

Striker Lukas Podolski posted a picture with team-mates including Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez as the squad enjoyed a sit-down meal at a very grand-looking venue.

'My table tonight... Friends from countries far and wide,' Podolski wrote on Instagram.

The Germany forward, whose future at Arsenal remains unclear after growing frustrated at a lack of game time, was also pictured with his international team-mate Ozil.

Olivier Giroud, who netted his fifth goal in seven Premier League games  in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool, was snapped with his wife Jennifer as the glamorous duo posed for a romantic picture.

It is the players' second Christmas do after several members of the team donned festive jumpers after last Saturday's 4-0 win against Newcastle.

Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott and Kieran Gibbs were among the players to dress up in Christmas-themed attire.

Next up for Arsenal is a Boxing Day visit to the Emirates from QPR as Arsene Wenger's side will be expected to return to winning ways.
