Playing with puzzles and building blocks alongside parents is more beneficial to toddlers than learning to read and write at a young age, according to a university psychologist.

Cambridge University lecturer David Whitebread said it was important for parents to play with their children, as these youngsters were more likely to enjoy solving problems, and better equipped to cope with failure.

Former primary school teacher Mr Whitebread also claimed the government was overly concerned with getting children to learn the 3Rs at an ever decreasing age, and said younger children were better off learning to cook alongside their parents.

'If you want your child to do well at school, then spend time with them in early life,' he told The Times at the Lego Idea Conference in Denmark.

'They need episodes of shared attention, doing puzzles, reading books or playing with building blocks.'

Mr Whitebread, a developmental cognitive psychologist, said that although learning to read was an important skill, teaching reading, writing and arithmatic to toddlers was a waste of government money and the child's time.

He said that studies have shown toddlers who were taught to be 'self-regulated' learners were more likely than their contemporaries to enjoy problem solving, and more likely to know what to do if they made an error.

A US study found that by the time children who learned how to be self motivated became adults they had achieved higher grades academically, earned more money and were less likely to be involved with crime.

Separate 
research has shown there was a link between a toddler's ability to 
concentrate on different tasks and their language skills.

Mr Whitebread said that learning to read at to young an age could even be damaging for a child.

'Instead
 the parent can share something they love, such as making cakes, or 
tinkering with engines, the key is partly sharing the enthusiasm but 
mainly the conversations you have with the child while doing it.'
