Brave: Jordan Rice, 13, told rescue workers to make sure his younger brother, Blake, was saved first during the Queensland floods in 2011

When schoolboy Jordan Rice insisted that rescuers save his little brother first as raging flood waters surrounded them in Toowoomba, Queensland, in January 2011, his incredible bravery touched hearts all over the world.

The 13-year-old's actions saved his 10-year-old brother Blake's life over his own, as they stood stranded in rising waters with their mother Donna during the deadly flash flood.

His final words: 'Take my brother first,' led to promises from politicians that Jordan would posthumously receive the Cross of Valour - Australia's highest civilian honour for bravery.

Three years later, his father is still waiting for the accolade.

In a heartbreaking letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Jordan's father John Tyson has written: 'Three years on, I feel like Jordan's bravery has been forgotten about, and all the talk by politicians were empty gestures.'

He has started a campaign to get his son the award that he so deserves after then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard told him 'the legend of Jordan's amazing courage will go on'.

Ms Gillard met Mr Tyson on a visit to Toowoomba while speaking with flood victims, three months after the devastating floods in January 2011.

During the meeting she even autographed Jordan's brother Blake's cloth sling, which he was using to nurse an arm injury caused by the natural disaster.

Liberal leader Tony Abbott also recommended Jordan receive the Cross back in 2011 but nothing has yet eventuated.

'I was so proud. I waited, waited and waited - but it never happened,' Mr Tyson says in a petition on Change.org.

'Nothing will ever bring Jordan and Donna back. But it would mean the world to us to have his last moments of bravery acknowledged.'

The gold Cross of Valour was established in 1975 to replace the British George Cross, previously awarded to Australians, and has so far only ever been given to five men.

It was last awarded in 2003, to two heroes from Western Australia who entered bombed Bali nightclub Paddy's Pub, in the tourist district of Kuta, in 2002 to rescue people, despite ongoing explosions and their own personal injuries.

In January 2011, Jordan, his brother and his mother were trapped on the roof of the family's car as raging floodwater surrounded them.

When a Good Samaritan, Warren McErlean, waded over to rescue the family Jordan insisted his little brother was saved first despite not being able to swim himself.

'Moments later, Jordan and his mum were swept to their deaths,' Mr Tyson said.

Mr McErlean, who saved Blake, told news.com.au he completely backs the petition.

'I'm right behind anything that will remember what Jordan did and goes towards recognising his actions.'

To Tony Abbott,

My son's last words were 'take my brother first'.

He and his mother were trapped on the roof of our family car as the massive 2011 Queensland floodwaters surrounded them – and as a good samaritan waded in to help my brave little son Jordan, just 13 years old, insisted his little brother was saved first.

Jordan couldn't swim. He must have been petrified. But he put his fears aside to make sure his brother made it through the terrifying flood.

Moments later, Jordan and his mum were swept to their deaths.Time can never heal what losing them has meant for us. We're still devastated, and struggling.

In the wake of the floods there was a glint of light in the darkness – there were calls by politicians in Canberra for Jordan to be recognised for his incredible bravery.

'The legend of Jordan's amazing courage will go on,' said Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Tony Abbott, who was opposition leader, said Jordan should get the Cross of Valour, Australia's highest civilian award for bravery.

I was so proud. I waited, waited and waited - but it never happened. Three years on, I feel like Jordan's bravery has been forgotten about, and all the talk by politicians were empty gestures.

Nothing will ever bring Jordan and Donna back. But it would mean the world to us to have his last moments of bravery acknowledged.

A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott told the website he supported Mr Tyson's calls for Jordan to be appropriately acknowledged.

'Nominations for bravery awards in the Australian Honours system are considered by the Australian Bravery Decorations Council, which makes recommendations to the Governor-General,' she said.

'The Prime Minister has approached the Governor-General to ask for his support in ensuring proper consideration is given to any nominations for bravery awards relating to this tragic incident.'
