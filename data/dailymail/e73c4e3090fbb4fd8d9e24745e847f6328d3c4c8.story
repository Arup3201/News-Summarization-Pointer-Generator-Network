George Knoop, 77, was stabbed multiple times Tuesday afternoon in the Delmas section of Haiti's capital. The missionary from Chicago was alone at the time and apparently knew his assailant, according to friends and police.

Detectives have taken two statements, but no arrests have been made in the case and the motive for Knoop's murder is still not known, said John Munsell, chairman of the board for the Quisqueya Chapel in Haiti where Knoop worked.

American missionary George Knoop, 77, was stabbed to death at his home in Port-au-Prince, Haiti on Tuesday. He was also a volunteer for U.S.-based Missionary Flights International

Knoop's home in Haiti. Police are still searching for the person responsible for his murder and believe he knew his assailant

'We're definitely wanting this person to be found and brought to justice,' said Munsell. The Quisqueya Chapel is a non-denominational and evangelical church.

A memorial for him was held at the church on Wednesday by his shocked friends and fellow church members.
 'It's a small community and we're all pretty devastated,' friend and 
fellow church member Zach Segaar-King said.

After he was stabbed, Knoop called a security guard who worked at the church and cried for help. Munsell said Knoop may have called the guard because it was the first number he could reach in his cellphone.

Church members then went to Knoop's home, a two-minute drive away, and he was found on the floor. Police later recovered the knife. A computer was apparently stolen during the attack but it does not appear robbery was the motive

Knoop was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead at 5:09 p.m.

'In terms of us here at the chapel we are not aware of any conflicts he had with people,' Munsell said. 'He was well-liked.'

Knoop also worked in Haiti as a 
volunteer for U.S.-based Missionary Flights International. Larry 
Campbell, vice president of operations for the organization, said Knoop 
had been a teacher in the Chicago area who felt called by God to work in
 Haiti after attending a church presentation about the devastating 
January 2010 earthquake.

'He
 felt that God wanted him to work there, where people had need,' 
Campbell said. 'And he went down and tried to see what he could do.'

Knoop also mentored young men and led Bible study groups. 'He worked with guys, take them under his wing and follow up with them. 'How's it going?' That kind of stuff,' Munsell said.

Knoop came to Haiti for the first time in 2010 in the aftermath of the earthquake. He became an elder with the Quisqueya Chapel and a worked as a volunteer for U.S.-based Missionary Flights International.

He was divorced and didn't have any children, Munsell said.
