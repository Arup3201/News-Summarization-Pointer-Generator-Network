Sunderland’s players have offered to refund supporters the cost of their match ticket following Saturday’s 8-0 humiliation at Southampton.

Skipper John O’Shea has confirmed that the squad want to acknowledge the 2,500 fans who travelled to the south coast, many making a 640-mile round trip from the North East.

And the players will now pay out an estimated £60,000 either to fans who wish to be reimbursed or to the Sunderland-based hospice Grace House.

Despite the disastrous scoreline, the Sunderland fans continued to show their support at St Mary's stadium

O’Shea, speaking on behalf of the squad, said: ‘We win and lose as a team, players, staff and fans, however we wanted to acknowledge and thank the supporters who travelled such a long way to give us their backing and despite everything, stayed with us until the final whistle.’

The defeat equalled the worst in the club’s history and afterwards goalkeeper Vito Mannone insisted the players should refund fans.

The Black Cats will look to bounce back when they face Arsenal at the Stadium of Light on Saturday.

'Supporters must enclose name and address details, along with their customer number. After the November 5 deadline, the outstanding money not claimed by supporters will be given to Grace House.’
