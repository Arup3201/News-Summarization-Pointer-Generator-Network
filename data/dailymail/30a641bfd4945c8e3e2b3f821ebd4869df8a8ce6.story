President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron told a packed house of reporters Friday that Congress should hold off on legislation that would impose tough new sanctions on Iran as talks about that nation's nuclear ambitions continue.

'My message to Congress is "Just hold your fire",' Obama said during a rare joint White House press conference, insisting that he can easily fall back on a new sanctions regime if talks fail.

'That's not a difficult vote for me to get through Congress,' he said, asking for 'a few months' to avert a larger crisis.

Cameron acknowledged that he has been active in lobbying U.S. senators, urging them to consider taking a wait-and-see approach.

'Yes, I have contacted a couple of senators this morning and I may speak to one or two more this afternoon,' he said, while cautioning that he was not calling 'as British prime minister to tell the American Senate what they should or shouldn't do. That wouldn't be right.'

UNITED: US President Barack Obama (right) and Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron (left) held a press conference in the East Room of the White House on Friday and insisted that the threat of new Iran sanctions could torpedo a nuclear agreement 

Cameron acknowledged that he had taken the unusual step of directly lobbying members of the US Senate to keep their powder dry and back off from new sanctions threats while negotiations proceed

But he said he had communicated 'that it's the opinion of the United Kingdom that further sanctions – or further threat of sanctions at this point – won't actually help to bring the talks to a successful conclusion.'

'And they could fracture the international unity that there's been, which has been so valuable in presenting a united front to Iran.'

'We should not impose further sanctions now,' Cameron had already said during his opening statement, in a clear shot across Congress's bow. 

Iran has maintained that it's only developing nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes but Europe and the U.S. are skeptical – and determined not to let the Islamic republic's mullahs take possession of a nuclear weapon that could target Israel or other countries.

A press aide to Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of the two lawmakers most visible in crafting a new sanctions proposal, said a call with Cameron had been scheduled for Friday but never took place.

But Kirk said in a statement that 'Iran sanctions were signed into law four times with bipartisan, veto-proof majorities in the Senate and the House.'

'If anything can stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it is maintaining the united bipartisan front in Congress to end Iran’s uranium enrichment and plutonium paths to the bomb. Now is the time to stand united against Iran’s nuclear threat, not to divide into partisan corners.'

A spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Kirk's counterpart on the bipartisan measure, did not respond to a request for comment about whether he had spoken with Cameron.

But Menendez vowed on Friday to push ahead with his bill.  

'All I'm saying,' he declared during a press conference in New Jersey, 'is let us put in prospective sanctions that don't get imposed, don't get imposed, until July.'

Menendez said he has a 'fundamental disagreement' with the Obama administration.

Cameron defended his tactics on Friday, along with the current level of pressure the West has put on Iran.

BUDDIES: Obama calls Cameron 'bro,' it has emerged in recent days, and they expressed mutual admiration during Friday's press conference; the two are shown Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House

'I think the big picture is very clear,' he said: Sanctions that America and the European Union  put in place have had an effect. That has led to pressure, that pressure has led to talks, adn those talks at least have a prospect of success.'

'I would argue with the president: How much better is that than the other potential outcomes.'

'Congress needs to show patience,' Obama agreed. 'WIth respect to the veto ... I will veto a bill that comes to my desk. And I will make this argument to the American people as to why I'm doing so.'

'Under the interim deal that brought Iran to the table, we were not supposed to initiate new sanctions.'

He dismissed the argument that the latest congressional legislative language doesn't impose new economic penalties on Iran, but merely promises them if talks fail.

'I assure you that is not how Iran would interpret it, or our partners would interpret it. So the likelihood of the entire negotiations collapsing is very high. And if that happens, there is no constraint on Iran at that point going back and doing exactly what it had been doing before they came to the table: developing a heavy-water reactor that, once built, is extraordinarily difficult to dismantle and very difficult to hit militarily.'

He also warned that Iran would develop more advanced centrifuges for fissionable material and return to underground bunkers.

'And they would be able to maintain that the reason they ended negotiations,' Obama warned, 'was that the United States was operating in bad faith, and blew up the deal.'

'There would be some sympathy to that view around the world, which means that the sanctions that we have in place now would potentially fray – because imposing these sanctions are a hardship on a number of countries around the world. They would love to be able to buy Iranian oil.'

PROMISE: Obama vowed to Congress that he 'will be the first one to come to Congress and say we need to tighten the screws' if Iran backs away from the bargaining table

'There is no good argument for us to try to undercut, undermine the negotiations until they've played themselves out,' the president said. 

'Now if Iran ends up ultimately not being able to say yes, if they cannot provide us the kinds of assurances that would lead myself, David Cameron and others to conclude that they are not obtaining a nuclear weapon, then we are going to have to explore other options.'

'And I will be the first one,' he pledged, 'to come to Congress and say we need to tighten the screws.'

Cameron said that 'if the Iranians say no, and there is no deal, then by all means let's sit down and work out what extra sanctions to put in place.'

'We're absolutely united in a simple thought, which is: A deal that takes Iran away from a nuclear weapon is better than either Iran having a nuclear weapon or military action to prevent it. In the end it comes down to that simple choice.'

Obama emphasized that 'I am not – repeat, NOT – suggesting we are on immediate war footing, should negotiations fail.'

But he warned the new Republican-dominated Senate that there will be a political price to pay if the threat of new sanctions torpedoes a deal with Tehran.

'Congress should be aware that if this diplomatic solution fails, then the risk and likelihood that this ends up at some point being a military confrontation is heightened,' he said. 'And Congress will have to own that as well, and that will have to be debated by the American people.'
