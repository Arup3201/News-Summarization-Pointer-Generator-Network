Ministers say they are 'minded' to go ahead with plain packaging for cigarettes

The government has cleared the way to for cigarettes to be sold in plain packs, despite an outcry from Tory MPs about the ‘nanny state’.

Health minister Jane Ellison said she is ‘minded’ to ban branded packs after an official study found it would lead to a ‘modest but important reduction’ in smoking rates.

But in the Commons she faced stiff criticism from Conservatives, who claimed the next step would be to force alcohol to be sold in brown paper bags.

The government has been bitterly divided over the issue of cigarette packaging and its impact on persuading people to give up smoking.

Last year David Cameron was accused of caving in to big tobacco after the idea was shelved to allow the Tories to focus on winning votes based on the economy and welfare.

But health ministers were furious, and commissioned a review by Sir Cyril Chantler, a former smoker, which today said putting cigarettes in drab and unattractive packaging would contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking.

Smoking groups claime that stripping cigarette packets of branding would lead to an increase in the illicit trade of tobacco products and job losses.

Miss Ellison said: ‘Smoking kills nearly 80,000 people each year in England alone and our cancer outcomes stubbornly lag behind much of Europe.

‘Quite apart from the enormous pressure this creates on the NHS, it is a cruel waste of human potential.

‘Yet we know that the vast majority of smokers want to quit and even more tragically we also know that two-thirds of smokers become addicted before they are 18. As a nation therefore we should consider every effective measure we can to stop children taking up smoking in the first place.

She added that wanted to move forward as swiftly as possible, explaining: ‘I am currently minded to proceed with introducing regulations to provide for standardised packaging.’

But the move was repeatedly criticised in the Commons by Tory MPs. Robert Halfon said: ‘The logical extension of what she is proposing is that we put brown paper bags over all alcohol.

‘Conservatives believe in freedom and the best way to stop smoking is through education, not by banning things.’

Sir Gerald Howarth said: ‘I do not believe that this is a Conservative measure, it is an example of the nanny state.’

Bury North MP David Nuttall said: ‘One unintended consequence of hiding cigarettes behind shutters and putting them in standardised packaging may only increase the desire of inquisitive children to take up smoking.’

However, health campaigners hailed the review into standardised cigarette packaging as a ‘significant step’ towards its introduction.

Cancer Research UK's chief executive Harpal Kumar said: ‘This should happen as quickly as possible. We have the evidence and the overwhelming support of parliament, the health community and the public. No more time should be wasted.’

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said: ‘Sir Cyril Chantler has quite rightly concluded that there is a strong public health case for standardised packaging of cigarettes and tobacco packaging, and that the tobacco industry's arguments against the policy are spurious.’

Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, added: ‘We now look to the Government to take heed of Sir Cyril's review and ensure that legislation on 'plain' standardised packaging is implemented at the soonest possible opportunity.’

Pro-smoking groups and tobacco companies criticised the review.

Daniel Torras, managing director of Japan Tobacco International said: 'Nothing has changed since last summer when the Prime Minister said "there isn't yet sufficient evidence for it and there is considerable legal uncertainty about it”.

'The Chantler report expilcitly references the "limitations" of the evidence presented by a small group of tobacco control lobbyists.'
