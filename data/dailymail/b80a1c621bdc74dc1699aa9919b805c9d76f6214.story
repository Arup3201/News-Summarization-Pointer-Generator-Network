Jon Bon Jovi's teenage daughter was arrested at her college on Wednesday morning - after allegedly overdosing on heroin.

Police in Upstate New York responded to a call that Stephanie Rose Bongiovi, 19, was unresponsive in her dorm room at Hamilton College - a well respected, $55,000-a-year liberal arts institution in Kirkland.

Stephanie is understood to have received medical treatment and is set to be released from hospital at some point on Wednesday.

Cops and a volunteer ambulance squad were called to the scene at 1.51am, according to People.com.

The
room was searched and a 'small quantity' of heroin along with marijuana
and drug paraphernalia was found, according to the Town of Kirkland 
Police Department.

Stephanie - also an aspiring model - was arrested and charged on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance 
possession of marijuana and criminally using drug paraphernalia, police say.

She has since been released from custody and ordered to appear in court at a later date on the misdemeanor charges, TMZ reports.

Police also arrested and charged 21-year-old student Ian S. Grant on suspicion of drug possession, who like Bongiovi, is from Red Bank, New Jersey, People reports.

MailOnline contacted representatives for the Bon Jovi frontman - who had no comment on the matter for the time being.

Hamilton College has released a 
statement, saying it is co-operating with the police investigation - but
would not say what action it will be taking against Stephanie.

It says say the 'alleged actions' not
only violate state law, but also contravene college policy - stressing 
the primary concern is with 'the safety of our students'.

The statement, obtained by WKTV, reads: 'The 
college is cooperating with the police investigation. 

'Our first concern 
is always for the safety of our students. Out of respect for the privacy
of our students and in accordance with federal regulations we do not 
discuss individual health or disciplinary matters.'

Stephanie is Jon's only daughter and the oldest of his four children, who he shares with wife Dorothea Hurley.

The news will no doubt come as a huge blow to Jon, 50, who these days prides himself on his family-man reputation.

The singer has been married to his 
wife Dorothea - his childhood sweetheart - for 23 years and is regarded 
as having one of the strongest marriages in Hollywood.

He has admitted to dabbling in drugs himself in the past - but says he 'wised up quickly'.

In
a 2007 interview with Best Life magazine, he confessed: 'I did the drug
thing very young and wised up very young too, because I 
was into drugs a little too much.

'I've never been a drug guy.
I've always felt I didn't have the mental stability to handle drugs.'

Bon Jovi is scheduled to perform at a benefit concert for Hamilton in Times Square on December 5.
