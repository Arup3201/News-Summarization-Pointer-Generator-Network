Guilty: Dominatrix Lorraine White, pictured leaving Stockport Magistrates court, was fined £8,000 for breaching fire safety rules

A dominatrix who whipped cross-dressing men while they were chained up and gagged has been fined for a serious breach of health and safety rules.

But it’s nothing to do with the way she physically treated her clients.

Lorraine White, 41, was fined £8,000 for breaching fire safety rules at her Stockport sex dungeon.

Magistrates heard how the firemen were unable to get into the building after a blaze broke out there.

Once they finally did gain access they found a trove of handcuffs, chains and other restraining devices in the basement.

Crews were called to the building on Vauxhall industrial estate, Greg Street, on October 30, 2012 after a maintenance man reported a basement fire.

They struggled to gain access to the Medusa club due to the locked doors but eventually they managed to enter and discovered the sex dungeon.

The fire had been sparked by a leaking gas heater.

When questioned, White admitted she had no idea she was responsible for fire safety arrangements.There was only one manually operated fire alarm and one fire exit was permanently locked.

Nature of the business: Ms White said her clients cross-dress and are humiliated

Costs: White, who earns £1,100 a month from the business, spent £10,000 refurbishing her smoke-damaged dungeon

Ignorance: White said she had no idea that she was responsible for fire safety measures

Ms White's sex dungeon is located at Vauxhaull Industrial Estate in Stockport

Ordinary home: Ms White lives in a leafy area of Salford

A dominatrix - or 'dom' - isn't a prostitute, but a female who feeds men's appetites to be controlled by a strong woman. Some dominatrixes don't even let their clients touch them.

Their trade revolves around BDSM, or bondage, dominance and sado-masochism, with clients paying to be chained-up, whipped and gagged.

It's an activity that famously takes place in bestseller Fifty Shades Of Grey. The upcoming movie based on the bestseller stars British actor Jamie Dornan (pictured above with Amelia Warner) as the BDSM-obsessed Christian Grey.

A dominatrix will usually wear black and red, tightly fitting clothes made from leather or rubber latex - and high heels.

Some might wear a corset to ensure their torso remains in shape.

Dominatrixes sometimes let clients use nitrous oxide, sometimes called laughing gas or hippie crack', to attain a feeling of elation.

According to talktofrank.com, nitrous oxide has 'several legitimate uses, but when inhaled can make people feel euphoric and relaxed' with some people experiencing hallucinations.

It warns that there is a risk of death 'as a lack of oxygen can occur' with the risk increased if the gas 'is consumed in an enclosed space'.

The dominatrix trade is legal in Britain - with practitioners only likely to fall foul of the law if they cause clients lasting injuries or marks.

Fire investigators found several 
canisters of nitrous oxide, laughing gas - also know as 'hippie crack' -
 which White’s clients used to get high. Elizabeth Dudley-Jones, 
prosecuting, said: ‘She was asked what would happen if there was a fire 
when her clients were under the influence of the gas and restrained.

‘She said she had not considered it.’

Ms
 Dudley-Jones said White was asked about the activities in the club. 
‘She said nothing was too severe. Slight bondage, possibly a mask or 
gag. It involved a lot of humiliation, doing domestic work and dressing 
up in women’s clothes.’

White, a former beautician, from Chaseley Road, Salford, pleaded guilty to four charges of fire safety rules, including failing to carry out a risk assessment, install suitable fire alarms, maintain emergency exits, or install emergency lighting.

She was fined £5,000 for the offences and ordered to pay £3,000 costs and a £120 victim charge.

White, who earns £1,100 a month from the business and spent £10,000 refurbishing her smoke-damaged dungeon, agreed to pay the sum at £100-a-month.

Peter Grogan, defending, described his client as a small businesswoman of good character.

He said the business now fully complied with the fire service requirements.

Concluding the case at the Stockport court, Chairman of the bench Michael Johnson said: ‘If you find a business where you can earn more don’t hesitate.

Fire prevention chief Peter O’Reilly said: ‘No matter what business you may have, you must take fire safety seriously.

‘In this case the defendant admitted that she didn’t know about the regulations and that she had done nothing to make the premises safe.

‘I would urge all businesses to ensure their risk assessments are up to date and that the proper procedures are in place to give staff and customers the best possible chance of escape in the event of a fire.’
