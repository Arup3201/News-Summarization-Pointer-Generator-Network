Steven Naismith has warned Georgia to expect a Scotland onslaught at Ibrox on Saturday.

The Everton attacker is certain to start the Euro 2016 qualifier as Gordon Strachan’s side seek their first points in Group D after last month’s narrow defeat by world champions Germany.

And Naismith is expected to play off Sunderland’s on-form Steven Fletcher as the Scots seek to kick-start their qualifying campaign ahead of the trip to Poland next week.

‘I think we will be more positive,’ said Naismith. ‘We will be more attacking than we were in Germany. We will need to be.

‘We are probably more favourites to win the game and there are players on form.

‘Fletch (Steven Fletcher) has done very well in getting goals. He’s a quality player. It’s probably the first time he’s had a run without injuries. We should be going on to create a lot of chances and be more attacking so it will be different, whether or not I’m playing, Fletch is playing or we’re both playing.

‘We’ve also got other guys. Shaun Maloney, who never played against Germany, will be looking to play. Even Moz (James Morrison) has played further forward. With Darren Fletcher and Scott Brown in the middle, that might bring him into contention for that.

‘Even Stevie May. People are still debating whether he is good enough or not, but what he has shown this week has been brilliant. He’s someone I have been really impressed with. It might come too quickly for him to get in this one, but he will be competing for places soon enough.’

Naismith, meanwhile, said he is relishing his first game at Ibrox since his acrimonious departure from Rangers.

Naismith will head back to Ibrox for the first time since joining Everton from Rangers in 2012

The 28-year-old was one of a raft of players who refused to transfer his contract to Charles Green’s newco in 2012, quitting for Everton soon after.

Reluctant to return to the stadium since, Naismith said: ‘It should be good. It’s the first time I’ve been back since I left Rangers. I have some fantastic memories from there, not only of playing with Rangers, but when I was with Kilmarnock as well. Hopefully, it can be another good memory.

‘This game and next month’s against Ireland are circumstances that don’t come around much.

‘Although Hampden’s fantastic, you play the majority of your home games there so it’s nice to get a wee change. Going back to Ibrox will be good.

‘When I left to go to Rangers from Kilmarnock, it was a while before I went back to Rugby Park. It’s not that big a deal. I’ve never really thought: “It’s been a while.”’
