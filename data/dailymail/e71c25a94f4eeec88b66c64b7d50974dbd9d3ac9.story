This is the face of the mystery man who confronted a gang of rioting yobs but was  battered to almost death and left on a life-support machine.

Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, is currently in a coma after he tried to stamp out the fire which thugs started in a supermarket bin in Ealing, West London.

He remains in a critical condition in hospital today after suffering serious head injuries on Monday night on Monday evening.

Speaking from the scene of the attack, Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said he has been unable to contact the victim's family and appealed to the assailant to turn himself in.

The victim, whose identity was 
established only when locals recognised his description and officers 
used his keys to enter his house, remains critical on a life support 
machine.

Mr McFarlane said the investigation could turn into a murder inquiry.

The
detective described the scenes surrounding the attack. He said a 
handful of officers, not wearing protective gear, arrived at 10.45pm to 
reports of looting at the Arcadia shopping centre.

The
half dozen officers were massively outnumbered by scores of thugs and 
called for back-up as they were showered with missiles, including 
bottles.

'There was some suggestion he was attacked because he was stamping out fires that had been started,' said Mr McFarlane.

'An officer saw Mr Bowes being knocked over and attacked and they called for assistance. Officers arrived and they were able to drive the mob off.'

The injured 68-year-old was then taken to hospital. Mr McFarlane said the attackers 'clearly did not like what he did or said'.

Mr Bowes was found without a wallet or phone so officers faced an uphill struggle to identify him.

Concern: A police officer and another man come to the victim's aid in one of the most horrifying pictures to emerge from the rioting

Mr McFarlane said the victim, who is 
originally from Bournemouth, 'clearly kept himself to himself and 
appears to be a very private man'.

'I am desperate to get in touch with any of his family,' the officer said. He added that police have footage of the incident.

A man who stepped in to save a 
battered man who has set upon by youths in Ealing has told how he 
dragged the victim away from a raging fire.

Peter Firstbrook, 60, knelt with the 
Richard Mannington Bowes and bravely ushered away the feral youths who 
rampaged through Ealing on Monday night.

Father-of four Mr Firstbrook dragged the Mr Mannington Bowes' body away from the fire as it quickly engulfed his leg. 

Mr Mannington Bowes' is currently in a coma after he tried to stamp out the fire which thugs started in a supermarket bin.

Mr
Firstbrook said: 'There were about 120 youths. One of them, a big black
lad in his early twenties, approached me and said something along the 
lines of: 'There's one of your lot over there and he's injured.'

The documentary film-maker said that the man was beyond the rioters and so he knew he had to push past them.

Suspect: Police have released this CCTV image of the man they want to talk to over the attack

'When I saw him, I realised the man's leg was almost in the fire so I tried to drag him to safety,' he told the Telegraph.

'I
couldn't move him so I got three young lads from the crowd. They also 
seemed quite concerned and helped me drag him to an alleyway. Then they 
disappeared.

'I checked his pulse and his airways and tried to talk to him, but he was unconscious and had blood coming from his ear.'

Mr Firstbrook said that Mr Mannington Bowes had no visible external injuries which lead him to believe that his wounds were internal.

Police have now identified the man. His phone and wallet were stolen in the attack and it is believed that he lived alone.

He is now in a critical condition in hospital after suffering serious head injuries during the attack.

Officers from Scotland Yard are currently trying to trace his next of kin.

Mr Mannington Bowes was attacked at about 10.45pm after remonstrating with teenagers who were setting fire to two industrial bins outside a shopping centre.

Police officers who tried to aid the Mr Mannington Bowes were then pelted with missiles including bottles and bricks.

Riot squad officers who rushed to the scene had to push back the mob to reach the injured man while being attacked. A line of officers then held back the yobs as paramedics arrived.

Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said: 'I need the assistance of the community who may have witnessed the attack on this innocent man, to come forward and provide information or images they may have recorded on mobile devices.

'This information could be crucial in bringing those responsible for this terrible crime to justice.'

He said the victim was 'violently assaulted and knocked to the ground' as he tried to extinguish the fire, and added: 'Police officers who were under attack by the mob drove them away and pulled the victim to relative safety and rendered first aid with the assistance of members of the public in an attempt to save his life.

'Again I urge these people to speak to us as they may have valuable information.'

Police have also released CCTV footage of a man suspected of carrying out the attack.

The
suspect, a black man with a big build, is seen wearing a white t-shirt 
with writing on the front and a dark-coloured jumper over his shoulders 
in the images.

Mr Mannington Bowes attacker is believed to have earlier looted a supermarket in the affluent west London suburb.

Detective
Chief Inspector McFarlane said: 'Through CCTV we have identified a 
strong suspect. I know that on seeing these images of him people will be
able to identify him.

'If you know who this man is please contact my incident room. If you are this man in the CCTV, do the decent thing and give yourself up.'

The aftermath of the attack was caught on camera as the man, in a checked shirt and apparently wearing glasses, lies face down on the ground.

A resident has also described how he helped put out fires after the man was attacked by rioters.

Tom Wakeley, 31, said he and his neighbours ran out of their flats in Ealing with fire extinguishers and bottles of water to help douse the flames in wheelie bins.

Mr Wakeley said: 'I started noticing sirens at about 9pm, and there were a lot of hoodies around. From about 10pm you could guess it was going to kick off, there were a lot of them walking around and it was getting a bit sinister.'
