While the rest of Europe keeps its toes dry, elevated and toasty by the nearest fire place, the football season goes on in the Premier League with the traditional Boxing Day fixtures.

It's the start of a typically and traditionally packed fixture list for teams up and down the land but it is also a time for Christmas crackers as Sportsmail looks at the finest top flight clashes from December 26 over the years.

10. Sheffield Wednesday 3-3 Manchester United, 1992 

It wasn’t just at Old Trafford where Sheffield Wednesday could implode while leading against Manchester United (see 1993) – they could do it at Hillsborough too.

David Hirst, Mark Bright and John Sheridan had the Owls cruising just after the hour mark, before Brian McCLair scored twice in 13 minutes to set up a tense finale for the final 10.

A combination of comical Wednesday defending and fine attacking instinct ensured United an equaliser with six minutes left, as former Wednesday trialist Eric Cantona bundled home from close range. Arguably the first of many amazing United comebacks in the Premier League era.

9. Aston Villa 2-2 Arsenal, 2008

This Villa Park clash was crucial at the top of the table with Arsenal having eyes on the league title, while Aston Villa were well in the hunt for Champions League football.

The Gunners took control with goals before and after half-time from Denilson and Abou Diaby but Martin O’Neill’s side were far from finished.

Gareth Barry netted a 65th minute penalty following William Gallas’s foul on Gabriel Agbonlahor, before Zat Knight clinched a dramatic draw after turning home Stiliyan Petrov’s cross in stoppage time.

8. Manchester City 5-1 Hull, 2008

While Villa were rescuing draws against Arsenal, Hull boss Phil Brown was busy giving one of the more unorthodox team-talks seen in recent times.

With the Tigers 4-0 down at City thanks to doubles from Felipe Caicedo and Robinho, Brown held a three-minute team-talk at the break in front of the Hull supporters as he publicly gave his team a verbal lashing at the Etihad Stadium.

It brought his team a consolation strike in the second half through Craig Fagan, only for Stephen Ireland to restore City’s four-goal advantage just two minutes later in the 82nd minute.

7. Bolton 4-3 Newcastle, 2002

It was the year in which defensive coaches were given Christmas off at Bolton and Newcastle with this game seeing three goals inside the first 10 minutes, with an Alan Shearer equaliser sandwiched between Jay-Jay Okocha and Ricardo Gardner goals for Bolton.

The real shock here though wasn’t that Bolton would go on to win just their second home game of the season, but that Michael Ricketts (post England debut) would find the back of the net twice in the victory.

His final league goals for the Trotters were enough to seal the points despite 71st and 79th minute strikes from Shola Ameobi and Shearer to set up a close finish.

6. Everton 2-6 Manchester United, 1977

Back in 1977, Everton were the team going for the title and they were huge favourites at home to a United side languishing in 14th place in the old First Division table.

Martin Dobson and Bob Latchford scored for Gordon Lee’s side. But goals from Lou Macari (2), Steve Coppell, Jimmy Greenhoff, Gordon Hill and Sammy McIlroy gave United a stunning win in front of nearly 50,000 at Goodison Park.

Everton would go on to finish a distant third behind title winners Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, while United wound up in tenth at the end of the season.

5. Coventry 3-2 Arsenal, 1999

The football world would be stunned if Coventry defeated Arsenal on home turf today, but even back in 1999 it was a big surprise when Gordon Strachan’s team turned over the Premier League title challengers on Boxing Day.

Goals from Gary McAllister and Mustapha Hadji had given the Sky Blues a 2-0 lead at the break, and while Freddie Ljungberg pulled a goal back in the 67th minute for Arsenal, Robbie Keane restored the two-goal advantage five minutes later.

A rare league strike away from home for Davor Suker set up a tense final four minutes but Coventry held on for what is to date their last win against the Gunners.

4. Oldham 3-6 Manchester United, 1991 

Remember when players would celebrate after scoring against former clubs? Well Dennis Irwin didn’t just do it once, he did it twice, after netting a brace on first return to Boundary Park since leaving Oldham for Manchester United – and gesturing wildly with his arms on both occasions.

United gave youth a chance in this clash, and Oldham fans should have known better than to chant ‘donkey’ at Bryan Robson’s half-time replacement, as Ryan Giggs soon silenced his critics with a fine burst of pace on the way to scoring United’s sixth goal.

3. Charlton 4-2 Chelsea, 2003

It was the first year of Chelsea under Roman Abramovich but it would be a miserable first Christmas under the Russian owner as it took Charlton just 42 seconds to get stuck into Claudio Ranieri’s turkeys.

John Terry had levelled following Hermann Hreidarsson’s first minute opener, but Matt Holland nodded the Addicks back in front 11 minutes before the break.

Charlton extended their lead to in incredible 4-1 margin after half-time through Jonatan Johansson and Jason Euell, with Eidur Gudjohnsen’s 72nd minute reply for the big spending Blues nothing more than scant consolation at the Valley.

2. Chelsea 4-4 Aston Villa, 2007

A year before rescuing a draw against Arsenal, Villa were involved in another Christmas cracker as they severely dented Chelsea’s title aspirations at Stamford Bridge.

A Shaun Maloney double gave Villa a 2-0 lead, only for Zat Knight to receive a red card which paved the way for Andriy Shevchenko to grab a rare brace and equalise in the 50th minute for Chelsea.

Villa looked finished when Alex put the Blues ahead, only for Martin Laursen to equalise at 3-3 with 18 minutes left.

Ricardo Carvalho’s red card evened up the numbers, but Chelsea seemed to have stolen victory two minutes from time through Michael Ballack’s free-kick.

But Ashley Cole saw red having handled the ball to deny Villa a goal in the final minute, allowing Gareth Barry to rescue a point for O’Neill’s outfit from the penalty spot.

1. Derby 4-4 Manchester United, 1970

A relic from a bygone era in football. The legends read off like any other big clash, Denis Law, George Best, Bobby Charlton, Dave Mackay and Archie Gemmill among the big hitters.

The game was pretty decent too, with Law scoring twice along with Best to help United come from 2-0 down to lead 3-2 at Derby. The Rams hit back to lead 4-3 only for Brian Kidd to equalise for United.

But there is an old school winter feel to this game which will never be seen again. Snow covered pitches added a different challenge to players rather than a cause for complaint at the nearest snowflake. Check out the packed out Baseball Ground too. 

They sure don’t make stadiums like that any more. It is games like this which prove you don't need perfect under-soil heated stadiums or tika-taka passing to have a superb game of football or a Boxing Day classic.
