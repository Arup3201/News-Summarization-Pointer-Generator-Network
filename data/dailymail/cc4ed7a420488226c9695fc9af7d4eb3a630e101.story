Prince Charles clearly knows how to tell a joke as at a Prince's Trust Event tonight, he had Jerry Hall, and former Spice Girl Mel C in stitches.

The royal joshed with celebrities at the annual Prince's Trust Invest In Futures reception at the Savoy Hotel in London, and he was even privy to a few of magician Dynamo's card tricks.

At his second black tie event of the week, Charles sipped a glass of water as he chatted to rock stars and actors including Gillian Anderson, who's one of the charity's ambassadors.

As always, the Prince (third right) was able to attract a plethora of celebrities to aid his cause (L-R) Sir Ben Kingsley, Samantha Bond, Jools Holland, Ronnie Wood, Melanie Chisholm and Dynamo

The Prince clearly amused former Spice Girl Melanie C, who performed later in the evening 

Jerry Hall looked elegant in black and the former model, who recently chopped her famous long blonde locks, seems to be growing them out again, as her hair fell well below her shoulders.

The prince seemed relaxed and at ease as he talked to The Fall star Gillian, who sparkled in a black beaded dress with black lace sleeves and simple drop earrings.

Meanwhile, Melanie Chisholm roared with laughter at one of Charles's jokes. The singer, who wore a knee-length dress with white, silver and pleated panels, stood out as one of the only attendees not wearing all-black.

Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood made a statement in a shiny blue dinner jacket, his black hair brushed into their signature spikes. 

While his wife Sally Humphreys glowed in a berry-coloured high-necked dress. 

Comedian and actor Rob Brydon - and onscreen sparring partner of Steve Coogan - regaled His Royal Highness with a story on the red carpet, while the royal listened politely.

Among the guests at the star-studded event were actress Emilia Fox with her brother Freddie, presenter Edith Bowman and actor Tom Hiddleston

The dinner was hosted by Gandhi actor Sir Ben Kingsley and Samantha Bond and the lucky guests were treated to performances by pianist Jools Holland, Ronnie Wood, Melanie C and Dynamo.   

Magician Dynamo, whose real name is Steven Frame, credits the Prince's Trust with his success today.

Bullied at school and suffering from debilitating Crohn's disease, he launched his career with a cash grant from the Prince's charity and now he's an ambassador for the charity.

It's not the first time Dynamo has performed for the royal, in 2013 an illusion that made it look as though he was breaking his own fingers, prompted Charles to clutch his face with his hands.

Charles looked highly impressed at Dynamo's skills, though the magician seemed to be feeling the pressure 

Dynamo, who launched his career with a Prince's Trust grant, may have used Charles as a warm-up to his act 

On Tuesday, Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, joined 300 guests at the Banqueting Hall at a gala dinner for the British Asian Trust.

The royal laughed and joked with Bollywood star Rani Mukerji and Tasmin Lucia-Khan, while Camilla was resplendent in purple velvet, a diamond serpent necklace and amethyst earrings.

Today the couple explored central London, starting the day at the Art Workers' Guild in Bloomsbury before exploring St Bride's Church in Fleet Street.

While Camilla seemed to have thrown in the towel and headed home, her indefatigable husband was back on the red carpet.

It is hoped the annual Invest In Futures dinner will inspire the financial community to help underprivileged young people into work or training.

The programme was launched in 2005 by Michael Marks CBE and has raised more than £16m for The Prince's Trust, royalcentral.co.uk reports. 

Prince Charles began The Princes Trust in 1976 and he has said: 'You can see how it is possible to turn young people’s lives around and give them self-confidence, self-worth and self-esteem.'

The Prince’s Trust has funded well over an estimated 500,000 projects and programmes involving young people in the past 39 years.

The 2014 event, held in February 2014 at the Savoy hotel, raised  £1.5 million.
