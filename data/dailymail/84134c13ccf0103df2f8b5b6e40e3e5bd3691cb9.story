The HR director at a healthcare provider in Bangor, Maine claims she was instructed by the company’s CEO to only hire ‘young women with big boobs,’ according to a complaint filed with the state’s Human Rights Commission.

Barbara Mann was fired by Sunbury Medical Associates in Sept 2011. She claims she suffered sexual and age discrimination and was fired for complaining about CEO David Savell’s behavior.

An investigation by the Maine Human Rights Commission found this week that Mann had reasonable grounds for complaint.

Barbara Mann is claiming sexual discrimination against the CEO of Sunbury Medical Associates of Bangor, Maine

Mann claims that Sunbury's CEO had hired several waitresses and had told her she should just hire 'young women with big boobs'

Their report states that shortly after starting at Sunbury in 2003, Mann was told by the CEO 'that Sunbury had a "warm and fuzzy" HR department and that [he] wanted to change that approach,' so the department was no longer a place for employees to 'vent.'

In June 2010, the reports states that he told Mann that 'from now on, she should just hire "young women with big boobs."'

Prior to that, Mann says the CEO had made other comments about 'big boobs' and 'commended her on past female hires because he thought they were "cute and had big boobs.'"

In the report Mann says she found Savell's behavior to be offensive, such as betting with his personal assistant how big her breasts would get when she was pregnant.

In compiling the report, the Human Rights Commission also spoke to Savell, who denies ever using the term 'big boobs.'

The CEO also had a habit of hiring waitresses. In May 2011, he told Mann he was hiring another waitress to be assistant HR director.

When the new assistant was introduced to staff, she was ‘wearing a low-cut sweater which exposed her cleavage,’ the report states.

The CEO later called Mann into his office and told her he didn’t like the look on her face during the introductions, reports The Bangor Daily News.

Mann replied that the assistant should 'be required to wear appropriate business attire.'

In the report is also states that she told the CEO two other female employees wore more revealing clothes when they felt themselves to be out of favor with him. Mann also claims that she had noticed the CEO looking at their breasts 'and that this situation made her uncomfortable.'

Following Mann's comments to her boss about her new assistant's attire, Sunbury hired an attorney to investigate. Believing the attorney could not be impartial, Mann says she refused to answer their questions. She was then threatened with disciplinary action if she did not cooperate.

The attorney's report, issued in June 2011, concluded there was no basis for her claims.

In the new year Mann could file a civil lawsuit at the Maine Superior Court in Bangor, where a binding settlement could include financial damages

Three months later, Mann's employment was terminated.

The report compiled by Maine Human Rights Commission
 included statements from current and former Sunbury employees who described Mann as 'mean' and 'sarcastic.'

Sunbury,
 who claim Mann was fired because of 'lack of fit' and 'negative 
interactions with employees,' choose not to file a formal objection to 
the commission’s report. 

However in a statement from Sunbury’s lawyer Robert Brooks, he said the company disagreed with its conclusions.

'Sunbury has consistently denied Mann’s allegations,' it read. 'Sunbury presented the Commission’s investigator with ample evidence to show that Mann’s claim is without merit.

'Unfortunately, the investigator chose to discount this evidence and conclude simply that there is an "even chance" that there are reasonable grounds to believe Sunbury violated the Maine Human Rights Act. 

'However, if necessary, Sunbury will continue to defend itself against Mann’s allegation of illegal discrimination, which is untrue.'

In the new year the commission will invite both sides and their legal representatives to meet in a bid to reach a settlement. If that fails, Mann may file a civil lawsuit in Maine Superior Court, where a binding settlement can include financial damages.
