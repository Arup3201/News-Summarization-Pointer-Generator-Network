A murderer who slashed April Jones’ killer Mark Bridger across the face in jail was given another life sentence yesterday.

Juvinal Ferreira used a knife he made from a prison-issue Bic razor to cut Bridger on July 7, severing an artery and leaving a wound that needed 30 stitches.

Robin Frieze, defending, told Leeds Crown Court that Ferreira hoped the assault in Wakefield jail would make Bridger reveal where he had hidden the body of the five-year-old girl from Machynlleth in mid Wales.

Frieze said his client was 'under the impression that if he put the defendant in a state of fear then it would be more likely that it would achieve closure for the family of his victim'.

But Mr Justice Coulson said this was not a 'realistic ground of mitigation', adding: 'Convicted murderers cannot appoint themselves as unpaid investigators of another crime, no matter how serious.

'They plainly cannot do that by themselves committing violent crimes.'

Mr Justice Coulson handed Ferreira a life sentence with a minimum term of five years after he pleaded guilty to GBH with intent - meaning that he will now not be considered for release until March 2036.

Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, told the court: 'Bridger’s notorious recent conviction for the murder of April Jones, and the circumstances of that offence, became known to the defendant, and it is that which provided a pretext for this offence, which is a premeditated assault with a weapon resulting in exceptionally serious injury.

April was kidnapped and murdered by Mark Bridger, who coaxed her into his car as she played on her bike on October 1 last year

'Bridger was transferred to HMP Wakefield in June of this year and since Thursday July 4 he had been permitted association with other prisoners.

'The first few days had passed without incident.

'However, his presence had been noted and discussed on the wing, and the defendant decided to attack Bridger.

'The defendant saw him and walked directly up to him with the blade held between thumb and forefinger.

'He then slashed him down the face, causing a deep wound extending from temple to chin.

'He paused for a moment and looked Bridger directly in the eyes - in Bridger’s own words "as if to admire his work or show me who it was".

Mr Sharp told how Ferreira claimed he had flushed the weapon away but a search found a weapon close by that was very similar to his description.

Ferreira initially denied the claim, telling prison officers: 'What’s up, I’ve done nowt wrong', later admitting what he had done.

He was born in Guinea and grew up in the Gambia, arriving in the UK in 2007 with his mother and they lived in Dereham in Norfolk in April 2008.

It was here that he was 'frequently observed drunk and behaving in a bizarre and sexually aggressive manner,' Mr Sharp told.

The court heard he became friendly with a 47-year-old lady named Elaine Walpole, and he began regularly visiting her at her flat.

On April 26, 2008 he raped and murdered her in the flat. The court heard her death was as a result of a single stab wound to her neck.
