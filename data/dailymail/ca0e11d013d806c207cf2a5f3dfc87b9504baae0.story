Brutal: Aaron Jackson was working as a doorman at a nightclub in Leicester when a thug attacked him and bit a chunk out of his nose

A promising young boxer says his career is over after a thug bit off his nose is a row outside a nightclub.

Aaron Jackson suffered the horrifying injury while working as a bouncer at the venue, just days after signing a professional boxing contract.

Mr Jackson, 21, from Leicester, was left scarred for life after Sanchez Moore sank his teeth into the 21-year-old's face in June last year.

He says his boxing career is all but finished and he also fears he will be unable to return to door work - his only form of income.

Since the horrifying attack, Mr Jackson has undergone five painful operations to reconstruct his missing nose, using skin grown on his forehead to graft the new organ.

The groundbreaking procedure, by plastic surgeons at Leicester Royal Infirmary sees layers of skin stretched over the remaining stump of his nose, shaped into place and given time to grow and replace the missing tissue.

But 17-stone Mr Jackson, who was attacked out side Liquid Nightclub in Leicester, says his face will never be the same again.

He said: 'It will never be the same. When my partner saw me, she was shocked. Anyone would be shocked, but I've been assured that eventually it will look like a nose, not my nose, but a nose.

'I don't hate him [Moore], I don't think I hate him, but my mum does. I feel sorry for him. When he pleaded guilty, I could see in his eyes he knew how serious it was.

'There was an incident, but it was a difficult one to assess, so we gave him the benefit of the doubt.

'I asked him to leave nicely but he started kicking off.

'We struggled, but we were getting him out, then someone grabbed me from behind. We never found out who it was because the cameras didn't pick it up.

'He came at me and he bit me. I knew he had done something but I didn't know what until someone said I needed to go and sit down.

'I sat down and one of the managers came and looked after me and the police took me to hospital.

'At the time I didn't realise how serious it was - I just thought the doctors would stitch it back on.

'The whole thing has been really painful. I haven't been able to do anything for the past six months and I had to stop work. I was in the gym every day of the week. I haven't been able to go since this happened.

'I don't really know if I want to be a doorman anymore. This has put doubt in my mind as to whether I will go back.

'It was my birthday on January 11 - it wasn't really how I should have spent my 21st. I didn't want to go out. Now I just want to get back to doing some work and get back onto my feet and get back to normal.

'A couple of my friends have looked after me and have reminded me it will all be over soon and my family have been really supportive.'

'I only had a couple of amateur boxing bouts, but I turned pro because I wanted to see how good I could be. That's out of the window now, that's gone.

'I'll never know.'

Moore, 26, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Leicester Crown Court last week and will be sentenced on February 27.

Detective Inspector Chris Hitchin, from Leicestershire Police, said: 'The injuries sustained by the victim are probably the most horrific I have seen during my career in the force, this was a nasty assault on a man who was only doing his job.

'The victim has been scarred for life and has undergone a number of medical treatments and is due to have a further operation later on this week.

'The victim has been spared the ordeal of reliving the events of that night in the court room, but, unfortunately, he will never forget what happened and his reflection in the mirror is a constant reminder of that.

'Hopefully, the conviction and subsequent sentence will help reassure him that justice has been done.'
