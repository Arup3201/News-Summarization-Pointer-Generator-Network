Polish authorities are now investigating claims the CIA operated a secret prison in used to torture suspected terrorists.

News of the investigation comes after a Washington Post report Thursday that detailed the CIA bribe made to Polish intelligence officers and the egregious abuse that took place on the site.

The spy agency paid millions to its Polish counterpart during a secret 2003 meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw for the right to use a remote villa for detaining terror suspects, according to the Post.

Tortured: 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times at the secret Polish prison, according to the Washington Post

CIA operatives used the clandestine confines to waterboard 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times during interrogations. The former al-Qaida member is now being held in Guantanamo Bay.

The ‘black site’ was allowed to open after the CIA handed over two cardboard boxes filled with $15million, according to the Post. It was one of several across Europe.

The report spurred prosecutors in the Polish city of Krakow to open an enquiry into the matter.

‘In the course of the investigation that is underway, we will analyze this Washington Post article and will include it in our investigation,’ Krakow sicty spokesperson Piotr Kosmaty told Reuters.

The only way criminal charges could be filed is if Polish officials colluded CIA spooks to illegally detain or torture American prisoners, Reuters noted.

Poland has long refuted claims of any secret CIA prison within its borders, and the country’s prime minister moved to further distance himself from any responsibility.

‘These allegations that appear in the public sphere are allegations about prisons and torture committed by the CIA, not Poles but Americans,’ said PM Donald Tusk.

‘Irrespective of what prosecutors determine with regard to the responsibility of Poland's civil servants in this case, our role is to guard the interests of the Polish state,’ he added.

Hearings were held last month at the European Court of Human Rights regarding whether Poland had ever been complicit in torture, a decision is expected this year, the paper reported.

The CIA decided on the remote Polish villa after a ‘remodeled chicken coop’ it had been using in Thailand became overcrowded with Middle Eastern detainees, according to the Post.

Though the facility was not big, the American spies agreed to retrofit it with $300,000 in cameras and even converted a backyard shed into a cell.

'It was pretty spartan,’ an agency official told the paper.

Once remodeled, a number of prisoners were taken there – including Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.

Agents performed a mock execution on the man despite him being of little intelligence value, the official said.

‘He was an idiot,’ said the former CIA official. ‘He couldn’t read or comprehend a comic book.’

Mohammed was able to outlast the waterboarding because he memorized how long the waterboardings lasted and would just count down the seconds, according to the paper, but he eventually cracked.

So did Zubaida, he even offered to help get new detainees to talk, the official said.

These results likely are what led then-CIA director of operations Jose Rodriguez to say the techniques produced ‘dramatic positive results.’

Polish authorities will now determine if any laws were broken to achieve them.
