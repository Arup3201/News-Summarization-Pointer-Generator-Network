Seldom seen: Eduardo Saverin, pictured at a media event in New York last year, now lives a rarefied life in Singapore

On May 18, Facebook's long-awaited share flotation is expected to go ahead - and few will likely be happier with the news than original investor and co-founder, Eduardo Saverin.

Mr Saverin, 30, was friends with Mark Zuckerberg when they attended Harvard in 2004 and originally invested in the social network.Â 

The move left Saverin, who comes from a wealthy Brazilian family, with an estimated $2billion fortune, according to Forbes.

However despite a substantial boost in their collective fortune from the IPO, Saverin will unlikely celebrate with Zuckerberg and the former friends from his college posse.

Saverin began with a one-third stake in the company which was watered down when Zuckerberg began bringing others on board.

The founders became embroiled in a bitter legal battle which left Saverin with a 2 per cent stake, according to the Wall Street Journal - and still an incredibly wealthy man.

He now lives in Singapore where he has 
become notorious for his playboy lifestyle - buying bottles of 
champagne at the most exclusive clubs in the company of the super-rich, society crowd 
and supermodels.

Blogs have sprung up tracking his partying with many locals hoping to get close to the self-made billionaire.

He also reportedly drives a Bentley and lives in a penthouse in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods.

According to Asia Tatler, Saverin is a 
fan of hanging out at Singapore's only private members club Filter in the 
Conrad Hotel.

DJs are regularly flown in from around the world and high-end 
tables come with ice buckets overflowing of bottles of Belvedere vodka and Moet champagne.

Investment: Saverin has invested in a start-up cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Singapore 2009, to whom he also offers his business expertise

The whirlwind 
of parties, adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time 
for business apart from Saverin's investment in Rachel K - a start-up 
cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Universe 2009 whom 
Saverin also mentors.

During a launch for the brand at a rooftop party, Saverin said: 'With a company like Facebook, it's not just three people deciding how the world communicates, it's really about providing a tool so your customers can be themselves.'

He added: 'I think it really inspired me to see that she [Rachel Kum] went from Miss Singapore to pushing her line, that she's going with her passion.'

He has also ploughed money into information site Qwiki and online payment service Jumio.

The Facebook share flotation is expected to happen on Friday, May 18, with Mark Zuckerberg planning to start the 'roadshow' preceding the initial public offering (IPO) on Monday.

The social 
network, now eight years old, has 900million members and was valued at up to $79.3 billion.

It
 is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world's biggest - 
stock market entry of an Internet company since Google floated in 2004.

Zuckerberg, Saverin and the original start-up Facebook team including Dustin Moskovitz, Sean Parker and Chris Hughes were immortalised in the 2010 film The Social Network.

Saverin was played by Andrew Garfield and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game.

In reality, Saverin's former friend Mark Zuckerberg, who is worth an estimated $17.5 billion and is set to 
make another $1 billion from the Facebook flotation, lives a polar opposite lifestyle.

The 27-year-old is rarely seen out of a
 hoodie and lives a low-key existence with his long-term girlfriend in 
Palo Alto, California. He only bought his first property last year.

One thing Saverin does prize highly
 is his privacy and closely guards details of his life. He attends few of the many public events he is invited to speak at and endorse and rarely gives interviews.

It is presumably why he chose to set up home in Singapore which has relatively tabloids and paparazzi who follow the rich and famous compared to the U.S. and Europe.

Those
 who wish to speak to him on a business level must try to make contact 
through an intricate network of society contacts and similarly rich 
friends.

John Fearon, CEO of Singapore-based start-ups dropmysite.com and dropmyemail.com told the WSJ: 'Eduardo doesn't invest in much. He doesn't invest in Singapore companies.'

Last August, Saverin was spotted partying with dozens of models in St Tropez and spending $50,000 on champagne.

He flew a number of his friends over from Singapore and checked into the $8,000-a-night Hotel Byblos before going clubbing until the early hours.

The entrepreneur was also seen at the trendy Bagatelle Brunch in Nikki Beach with three friends and ten beautiful women drinking Cristal champagne from the bottle and spraying it over each other. The bar tab reportedly came to a cool $50,000.
