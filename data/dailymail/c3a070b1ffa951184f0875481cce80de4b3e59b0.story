A photographer has created his own surrealist dreamworld to escape the boredom of his day job.

Logan Zillmer, 28, used pictures taken every day for year to put together a collection of mind-bending illusions, including a floating house and mystical forest, to feed his creative urges.

The conceptual photographer from Michigan, who works as a retail manager by day, then combined the images in layers to create the stunning dream-like pictures.

Mind-bending: Conceptual photographer Logan Zillmer, 28, took an image a day for a year - using them to create surreal images. Here he is seen staring at a house suspended by a balloon 

Hanging on: The retail manager from Michigan was bored of his job and felt the need to ignite his creative urge 

Jumping through hoops: Mr Zillmer took a number of photographs and enhanced them to create images that would be nearly impossible in the real world

Rocket power: The collection - including this image of Mr Zillmer strapped to a rocket - stretches the boundaries of reality 

He said: 'The retail job is my "real person job" but I would argue that it makes me less of a real person. Photography has always been second nature to me, both because I've done it since I was 15 and because it is just how my mind works.

'It was time to realise the full potential of my creativity, and what better way to do so than to exercise it every day?' he added. 'I suppose you could call it surrealism. For me, it is just a further investigation of the unknown and the unknowable.'

When Mr Zillmer had lucid dreams, he wrote them down in an idea journal. He would then try to translate the visions into an image.

'Everything I photograph is real, and made to look real, but it is simply ordered in a way that renders the scene unreal.'

The runaways: This image shows a suitcase being flung out of the back of the car, with Mr Zillmer's female passenger desperately trying to retrieve it 

Reflection: This picture from the collection shows him climbing a step ladder and removing a piece of the blue sky

Images in the project include one which sees the photographer taking the sun from the sky to inspect it, and another in which a castle is carried away by a balloon. 

He said: 'When you write everything down that you think of, sometimes you will get some crazy stuff.' Mr Zillmer has a degree in film and has been interested in cinema and photography since he was in high school.

Until the beginning of 2013 Mr Zillmer was only interested in documentary making but after a series of failed attempts to get films made he was led back to photography.

He said: 'I let my imagination take the lead and it became apparent very quickly that through conceptual and surreal photography my voice speaks the loudest and with the most conviction I have realized recently that I only really care about two things: love and inspiration. Everything else is just a job.'

He and his wife Whitney are expecting twins and though the project was hard on both of them he is happy to have completed it. It was not easy for her. She had to deal with everything while I was doing this. She is amazing.'

Sneak peak: Standing in wintry conditions, Mr Zillmer pushes aside a curtain to reveal a sunnier scene behind 

Fallen: Mr Zillmer stands next to the sun which has dropped from the sky and melted a gap in the snow 

Trip: A shoe flies in the air as Mr Zillmer is seen periously falling backwards down a set of stairs

Fire: This incredible image shows the photographer bursting into flames in the middle of a lake while lighting a cigarette 

Burn after reading: The newspaper suddenly bursts into flames in this photo  while a concerned Mr Zillmer is reading it

Stunning: The photographer used multiple photos of biplanes to create this image of the aircraft soaring overhead 

A miniature world: Mr Zillmer walks towards a ray of sunshine which has broken through a gap in the trees of this mystical forest
