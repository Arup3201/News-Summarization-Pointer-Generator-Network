Ledley King is flying out to China on Wednesday on a scouting mission to find players talented enough to make an impact on Tottenham Hotspur’s academy as he begins a new coaching career at the club.

The 33-year-old has been an ambassador at White Hart Lane after an injury-induced early retirement two seasons ago and will now combine the two roles as he starts as assistant manager of the Under 18s.

It is a position of responsibility for King, who is seen as someone with the potential to kick on at Enfield Training Centre.

Part of the team: King is taking on a new role with Spurs to help them improve their youth system

Kidding around: The former England defnder will be working with children at Tottenham's academy this year

The former England international is giving himself a year to cut his teeth and will be in China for 10 days before embarking on his new job. 

‘A hundred or so local kids take part and I’ll be whittling the numbers down to come and train at the academy,’ King told Sportsmail. ‘For me it’s just to pick based on what I see and who I think has the chance of really making a career out of the game.’

Lee Young-pyo and Kazuyuki Toda are the only Asians to have previously played for Spurs - the latter making just four appearances after Glenn Hoddle signed him in 2003. It is a market the club are trying to tap into and King is confident he’ll find a cluster of ‘five or so’ ready to train with the youth teams.

‘As a young player you’re used to being in pressure situations. Good players will perform,’ he added. 

On his way: King's first task will be to travel to China and discover new talent for Tottenham

‘This will be going on throughout the year. I’m over that side of the world a fair bit at the moment. I come back for a week and then I’m off to Malaysia before going back again out in October.’

King himself will make a decision as to whether he wants to pursue a career on the training ground, be it as a coach or manager, next summer after a year working under Keiran McKenna with the Under 18s.

‘This is an opportunity for me to get a foot in the door,’ he added. ‘His skill will be putting on the sessions but I’ll be able to speak to the kids during that and point out things they can try doing.

‘Hopefully the combination works well. I would’ve loved to have a former player trying to help me at that age.

Blighted: The centre-back's career was ended prematurely after he failed to recover from continuous injuries 

National star: King won 21 caps for England in his career, and wants to help pass that experience on

‘It’s not for everyone. Paul Scholes has just come out and said it isn’t for him. This is why I’m taking on this new role, because it’s something I’m intrigued about and we’ll see if I’m good at it. I feel I’ve got something to offer.

‘Coming out of the game you have to try different things. This is my first option so to speak. I have to try it. It’s down to me while I’m there and I’ll know whether it’s something I can take on after the season.’
