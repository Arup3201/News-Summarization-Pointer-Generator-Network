Tragic: Detectives are continuing to quiz a man over the hit-and-run death of Callum Hilton, 16, from Bury, Greater Manchester

The mother of a 16-year-old boy knocked down on his way to a party with friends has told of her heartbreak after he died in her arms in hospital.

Callum Hilton was thrown 20ft through the air after being hit as he crossed a road with his cousin and friends in Bury, Greater Manchester, on Saturday evening.

Detectives are continuing to quiz a 32-year-old man over the hit-and-run death after arresting him in the Radcliffe area of Bury on Sunday afternoon.

Callum's mother Tricia 
Hilton wrote on Facebook yesterday: 'Can’t sleep and don’t want to, because it all becomes a reality when I wake up after holding my son whilst he passed.'

The teenager suffered serious head injuries after the crash and was taken to hospital but died hours later with his family by his bedside.

The tragedy happened on Stand Lane in Radcliffe - a busy main road with several 30mph speed limit warning signs.

In
a statement released by GMP, Callum’s grandfather Graham Hilton said: 
'We are absolutely devastated at this time at the tragic loss of Callum,
our beloved son, brother and grandson.

'Words
are not enough to express how we feel at this time over the tragic 
death of Callum. We ask that we be allowed to grieve at this sad time, 
but thank all his friends for their kind words and support.'

Heartbreak: Callum's mother Tricia Hilton wrote on Facebook: 'Can't sleep and don't want to, because it all becomes a reality when I wake up after holding my son whilst he passed'

Devastated: Friends of Callum share a tearful embrace, left, after visiting the scene of the crash, which happened shortly before 6.30pm on Saturday.  Others left flowers, tributes and cuddly toys tied to the railings

Callum was crossing the road near the
Hawthorn Hotel shortly before 6.30pm when he was hit by a silver or 
white Peugeot travelling down the hill towards Radcliffe town centre, 
police said.

He had been 
heading to a party which had been publicised on Facebook with two 
friends and his cousin. The boys, three aged 16 and one aged 18, were 
all from the Middleton and Heywood areas of Greater Manchester.

Detective
Inspector Amber Waywell, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The 
reason they were crossing the road was because they needed to get 
directions and they saw the hotel on the opposite side of the road.

Injuries: Callum suffered serious head injuries after being thrown 20ft through the air after being hit as he crossed a road with his cousin and friends

'From viewing the CCTV footage, Callum and his cousin had made it halfway across the road and the other two were waiting to cross.

'His cousin was slightly ahead, so was narrowly missed, and Callum was struck by the vehicle. It is a busy road, it’s a fast road, it’s a slope.'

She added: 'It’s just awful. I can’t imagine what his family, his mother, will be going through. A young boy goes out on a Saturday evening and doesn’t come home. She must be besides herself with grief and we are trying to support her as best we can.'

A police notice appealing for witnesses to the incident has been placed on a lamp post below a flashing 'slow down/30mph' sign.

A bunch of flowers was left nearby in memory of the teen. The card read #Callum xxx'.

Scene: The driver sped from the scene after hitting the 16-year-old in Stand Lane, Radcliffe, as Callum and his friends crossed the road

Shock: Flowers were being left at the scene in memory of the teenager today, following the hit-and-run smash

Restrictions: The tragedy happened on Stand Lane in Radcliffe - a busy main road with several 30mph speed limit warning signs

The 16-year-old was raised by his
mother and his grandfather, who have been left 'absolutely distraught' 
by the tragedy, GMP said.

A man who lives nearby and witnessed 
the 'heartbreaking' scene described how a neighbour, a nurse, and a 
passerby battled to save the boy as he lay in the road.

He said: 'As I was coming back home, the boy was already on the floor and there were two people offering first aid.

'One was a neighbour, a nurse who 
lives further up the hill and one was a guy who was driving past. With 
the boy were three friends, one was apparently his cousin but I don’t 
know any of them.

'It 
was heartbreaking to watch. The lad was in a very, very bad way. The 
frustration of standing there as two people try to save a young kid’s 
life was heartbreaking.'

He said cars were 'always' speeding up and down the road despite a number of signs waning drivers of the 30mph speed limit.

'There was a dog run over about 100 yards up the hill about 10 minutes before this boy was run over last night,' the man said.

'Last week a lady who lives down the road had her car struck.

'So just within this stretch of 200 yards there has been three accidents in a week. It’s very unfortunate.'

The 16-year-old was raised by his mother and his grandfather, who have been left 'absolutely distraught' by the tragedy, Greater Manchester Police said

Nearly 4,000 people had ‘liked’ a memorial on Facebook, while hundreds more posted messages of condolence directly on his mum’s wall or on other tribute pages.

Beth Loftus tweeted: 'RIP Callum Hilton, nobody deserves to go at such a young age. Stay strong for us up there.'

Daniella Jade added: 'Rest in peace Callum Hilton, gone but not forgotten.'

Greater Manchester Police have appealed for any witnesses to come forward.

Detective Inspector Amber Waywell added : 'We have made an arrest but I would continue to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward.

'Callum's family have suffered an unimaginable loss. He was 
just on his way to a party with friends and sadly will never be coming 
home to his family.

'They deserve to know exactly what happened so I 
would urge anyone who either witnessed what happened or has information 
about the movements of the silver Peugeot 206 to come forward.'

Shortly after the crash police recovered an abandoned silver Peugeot close to Bury town centre, but the vehicle has now been ruled out of the inquiry.

'It is now believed another silver Peugeot 206 was the vehicle involved,' a GMP spokesman said.

Anyone with information should call GMP on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
