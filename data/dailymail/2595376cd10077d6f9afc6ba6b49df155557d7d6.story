Nine serving BBC employees, including some famous faces, are under investigation for ‘serious allegations’ of sexual abuse following the sickening revelations about the late Jimmy Savile.

Some are being investigated by police while others have been reported to the corporation’s management.

But the BBC last night refused to say if any of the employees have been suspended.

It has emerged that some of those being investigated are or have been in the public eye. A BBC source told the Daily Mirror: 'The allegations are right across the corporation and they involve some famous faces. These complaints relate to recent and historic incidents.'

The revelation about the nine suspects emerged during yesterday’s questioning of BBC director-general George Entwistle by MPs over the Savile affair.

To add to the Corporation’s embarrassment, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon – who controversially shelved a film detailing Savile’s abuse – faced fresh criticism after an email emerged claiming that he played down the story because ‘it was 40 years ago’ and the girls were not ‘too young’.

And Culture Secretary Maria Miller made it clear she was unimpressed with Mr Entwistle’s often faltering performance in front of MPs – with aides saying it ‘resembled a car crash’.

She wrote to BBC Trust chairman Lord  Patten saying ‘very real concerns are being raised about public trust and confidence in the BBC’.

In a hostile session of cross-examination, Mr Entwistle failed to satisfy those still calling for an independent inquiry as he was repeatedly hauled over the coals and even ridiculed for not finding out more about the Savile film when informed about it last December.

He told the Culture Select Committee: ‘We are looking at between five and ten serious allegations relating to activities over the whole period in question, the Savile period. Some of these cases have been passed to the police where appropriate, and we are reviewing others within our normal HR processes and procedures.’

The BBC later said it was ‘aware of 
nine allegations of sexual harassment, assault or inappropriate conduct 
regarding current staff or contributors’.

The
 fact that nine employees are being investigated is a sign that the 
‘broader cultural problem’ of sexual harassment dating back to the 
Savile years of abuse still needs to be tackled.

Since
 the scandal erupted at the start of October, BBC stars – including Liz 
Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig – have alleged they were groped while live on 
air.

Asked by the MPs if there were active
 allegations against existing employees, Mr Entwistle said: ‘Information
 is being assembled on exactly that subject.

‘New allegations are being made and are coming in. What I am looking at is all the existing current allegations.’

The director-general did not dispute suggestions
 that child abuse had been ‘endemic’ at the corporation in the past, but
 insisted children were safe there now. ‘I believe we have good 
policies, but I am currently checking them to make sure they are as good
 as they need to be.’

David
 Jordan, head of editorial policy, said that if any allegations emerged 
which related to people still working for the BBC, the corporation would
 ensure they went to the police and that those involved were denied 
access to children.

Mr Entwistle told MPs he was bringing
 in Dinah Rose QC – who represented News International in phone hacking 
cases – to look at how the BBC handles sexual harassment cases.

‘This is something the BBC simply has to get right and I’m not sure we have got it right in every respect at the moment.’

Newsnight
 boss Mr Rippon ‘stepped aside’ from the role earlier this week after a 
blog he wrote  was revealed to be inaccurate in  key respects.

The
 latest email, revealed yesterday, suggests that Mr Rippon was trying to
 ‘kill’ the Savile story by making ‘impossible editorial demands’.

Channel
 4 News said it had seen the email from Newsnight reporter Liz MacKean, 
the reporter who worked on the investigation. In it she accuses Mr 
Rippon of backtracking.

It
 reads: ‘Having commissioned the story, Peter Rippon keeps saying he’s 
lukewarm about it and is trying to kill it by making impossible 
editorial demands.’

Claims: Since the scandal erupted at the start of October, BBC stars – including Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig – have alleged they were groped while live on air 

She adds: ‘When we rebut his points, he resorts to saying, “Well, it was 40 years ago ... the girls were teenagers, not too young ... they weren’t the worst kind of sexual offences etc”.’

If true, his comments will outrage child protection groups as they appear to play down Savile’s crimes.

Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘Oh my God. He said that, and in the year 2011? Now we know why he has “stepped aside”. What an inane thing to say, and sadly reminiscent of the attitudes of too many people who don’t take these crimes seriously enough.’

The email follows another in which Mr Rippon, when referring to the evidence the programme, had used the phrase ‘just the women’.

Broadcast on Panorama it read: ‘The key is whether we can establish the CPS did drop the case for the reasons the women say. That makes it a better story – our sources so far are just the women and a second-hand briefing’.

Conservative MP Therese Coffey said the email was ‘chilling’ and questioned whether the culture had really changed at the BBC.

Mr Entwistle told her: ‘That phrase, on the face of it, isn’t in the least defensible, of course. I do believe the culture has changed since the Seventies and Eighties but I’m not convinced it has changed as much as it should have.’

Emails that suggested senior BBC executives tried to cover up the scandal were pulled from the Panorama programme for ‘legal reasons’ amid concerns that others implicated in the shelving of the report could sue for damages.

At least one of these emails suggests the Savile report was being discussed by a ‘long political chain’ of executives.
