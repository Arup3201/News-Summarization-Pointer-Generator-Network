The BBC's Head of Television has been criticised after he appeared to claim viewers have 'free access' to the broadcaster's programmes.

Danny Cohen said the BBC should continue to offer viewers 'free access to news and great television' when he was interviewed on BBC One's Points of View show.

But critics rushed to point out that viewers are forced to pay £145.50 annual licence fee and accused Mr Cohen of being 'out of touch'.

The controversial comments came as Mr Cohen discussed whether the BBC should become a subscription service like on-demand internet TV site Netflix.

Arguing that the corporation's funding should stay the same, he said: 'I believe in the universality of the BBC, I believe the BBC should provide something for everyone, and it should be free access to news and great television programmes for everyone in the UK.'

But his comments were seized upon by those calling for reform of the licence fee, who insisted his mistake showed the corporation's complacency about its funding.

Conservative MP Rob Wilson told the Daily Telegraph: 'That Mr Cohen thinks paying £145.50 a year constitutes "free access" shows just how out of touch with reality some overpaid bosses really are.'

He branded the licence fee a '60-year-old idea' and called for it to be reformed to give customers better service.

Viewers also took to Twitter to mock the claims, with David Hartley tweeting: 'Give me free access to the BBC anytime!'

Website user Nick Dale added: 'Head of BBC TV Danny Cohen insists we keep ‘free access’ to the BBC - apart from the £145.50 licence fee we all have to pay, of course…'

Mr Cohen worked for E4 before joining the BBC in 2007 as controller of BBC Three. He was appointed to his current role as Director of BBC Television in April last year.

He is currently paid £320,000-a-year by the corporation, but defended his huge pay packet earlier this year
 by saying: '[BBC] executives continue to be well-paid, but if we went to 
commercial organisations we'd be paid roughly double.'

Earlier this year, he vowed to get more women on TV by putting an end to 'sexist' all-male line-ups on comedy panel shows like Have I Got News For You and Mock The Week.

His latest comments came as plans emerged to increase the fine handed out by magistrates to people who do not pay the licence fee from £1,000 to £4,000.

The BBC has faced down calls for it to become a subscription service but ministers recently announced a review of plans to de-criminalise the offence of not buying a licence.
