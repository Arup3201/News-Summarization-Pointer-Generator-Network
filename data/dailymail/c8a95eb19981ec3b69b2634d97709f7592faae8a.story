Manchester United defender Luke Shaw could return to action on Boxing Day against Newcastle United.

Shaw injured his ankle in the 2-1 Barclays Premier League win at Arsenal on November 22 and was expected to be out for between four and six weeks. 

But the 19-year-old left back has made good progress since then and is now on the verge of returning to full training.

If Shaw comes through the next few days unscathed he is line to figure at Old Trafford against Newcastle next week.

Ashley Young has done well in the left wing-back position in Shaw's absence and is prepared to fill that role again against Aston Villa on Saturday.

A win would see them record their seventh win in a row in the Premier League. 

It would give Van Gaal a boost of options ahead of the match on Boxing Day against Newcastle
