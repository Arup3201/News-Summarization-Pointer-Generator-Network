With her dark sunglasses and stony expression, the image of Hillary staring at her smartphone made her look such a boss that it launched its own Tumblr parody account.

The photograph, which dates from a trip to Tripoli, Libya in September 2011, was even adopted by the former Secretary of State herself for her Twitter profile picture.

However, it seems that the picture which inspired hundreds of comedy memes could be no laughing matter for Clinton as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun.

Indeed, Clinton herself has removed the image removed from her Twitter account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in Libya.

For more than a year, the former Secretary of State had used the monochrome image of her using a Blackberry on board a C-military plane headed to Tripoli in September 2011, around a month after Colonel Gaddafi's regime fell.

But the picture, regularly seen by her 2.9million followers, was removed Sunday - ostensibly to promote a political campaign for gender equality, timed to coincide with International Women's Day.

The image was once a symbol of Clinton's funny side as the face of the Texts From Hillary meme, which she said had given her 'many LOLZ' - but fell out of favor this week.

However, the change also comes at a time when senior figures in Congress are intensifying scrutiny of Hillary's communications from 2009-13, which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official State Department accounts.

Clinton has handed over swathes of communications from the time, but it has been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. 

The image was mentioned by the chairman of a House committee into the 2012 attack on U.S. diplomats in Benghazi to suggest that vital communications from Clinton's involvement in Libya were being kept from public view.

Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina), today told CBS's Face the Nation that he has been provided with no emails from the September 2011 trip - despite Clinton being clearly pictures communicating while aboard the plane.

Proof? The chairman of the House Committee on Benghazi mentioned that he has seen no emails from Clinton's time in Libya, despite pictures such as this one from 2011, showing her using a Blackberry

He said: 'There are gaps of months and months and months. And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip.

'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress.

'So, there are huge gaps. And with respect to the president, it's not up to Secretary Clinton to decide what is a public record and what's not.'

Gowdy also said the records don't include anything from around the dates of the Benghazi attack itself, in which the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed.

As of Sunday evening, Clinton's profile still featured the Blackberry image, but as the 'header photo' displayed at the top of the Twitter page.

In order to see it, users have to access her profile directly. The image will not appear in the timelines of her followers, nor when she is retweeted or appears in search results.

Clinton herself tweeted to explain the change of profile picture. She wrote: 'See my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide.'

She also included a link to Not-There.org, which is sponsored by the Clinton foundation she runs with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

Hillary Clinton used to love the photograph now shunted out of her Twitter profile - at least enough to spend time making a meme out of it.

After memes imagining her texting politicians and other celebrities took off, she made her own contribution. 

Diplomatically, unlike many entries on the Texts From Hillary Tumblr site, Hillary's entry does not insult any political rivals, but just ribs the site's creators.
