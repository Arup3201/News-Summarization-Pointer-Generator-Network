West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison has been remanded in custody after he was charged with punching and slapping his ex-girlfriend and her mother.

The 21-year-old, who used to play for Manchester United, appeared in court accused of attacking his ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor, 19, outside a bar in Manchester city centre in the early hours of Sunday morning.

He was also accused of assaulting the same woman and her mother Parveen Mansoor, 39, hours later.

Trouble: This is not the first time West Ham midfielder Morrison has been caught up in controversy

Morrison, from Urmston, Manchester, was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged with two counts of common assault. He appeared at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court on Thursday wearing a white t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms.

Before the hearing, a spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'At about 3.20am on Sunday 27 July 2014, police were called to an address on Alexandra Road, Peel Green, Salford, following reports a 19-year-old woman and a 39-year-old woman had been assaulted.

'Officers attended and established the young woman had also been assaulted outside a bar in Manchester city centre earlier that evening and a 21-year-old man was subsequently arrested at a later date.

'Ravel Morrison, of Urmston, is charged with two common assaults. He is due before Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court on July 31, 2014.'

Morrison was widely tipped to become a Manchester United regular as one of the club’s best home-grown prospects in their youth teams.

But the midfielder was sold by former boss Sir Alex Ferguson to West Ham for just £650,000 in January 2012. He has since been loaned out by West Ham to QPR and Birmingham City.

It is believed he earns around £15,000 a week and but a clause in his contract states that he will be entitled to a pay rise to £60,000 a week if West Ham receive a £10 million bid and want to keep him.

He will appear in court again at a later date.
