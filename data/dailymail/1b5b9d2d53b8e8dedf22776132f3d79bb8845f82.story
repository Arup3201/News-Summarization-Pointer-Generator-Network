Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino insists he will take criticism of his opening months at the club firmly on the chin.

The Spurs manager hasn't had the start he'd have wished for following his arrival from Southampton in the summer.

But the Argentine says he will not run from his critics, saying: 'It is a good thing to receive criticism. 

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino insists he does not mind receiving criticism  

Pochettino's side are currently eighth in the Premier League having won just four of their 10 league games

'All managers around the world are criticised. It is difficult to agree with all the people and make all the people happy. 

'Our job is difficult I understand my job and it is difficult to share the same decision (with others).'

Tottenham are currently eighth in the Premier League, having won four of their opening 10 games so far this season.

Pochettino's side take on Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League on Thursday before hosting Stoke City at the weekend.

Aaron Lennon and Younes Kaboul have also not travelled to Greece for their side's Europa League clash

Emmanuel Adebayor is again absent for Tottenham's Europa League travels, but head coach Pochettino denied his non-appearance against Asteras Tripolis is symptomatic of a wider problem.

'Aaron Lennon is not here, Kyle Naughton is not here, Younes Kaboul is not here,' he said when asked specifically about Adebayor. 'It is the same situation.

'I decide the list for those coming to Greece and the players here are the players in the squad that will play.

'Okay, yes, it is a reality that Adebayor has not travelled in three games from England, to Limassol, Partizan Belgrade and here.

'For every single mission, for every single trip, we have our organisation and selections. We are ready.'
