A one-year-old girl in China is suffering from a rare skin disease that makes her look like an old woman.

Yuxin Xiaoli is thought be suffering from cutis laxa, a rare connective tissue disorder in which the skin becomes inelastic and hangs loosely in folds.

Yuxin Xiaoli is thought be suffering from cutis laxa, which is a group of rare connective tissue disorders in which the skin becomes inelastic and hangs loosely in folds

The little girl’s face is covered with wrinkles, and the skin on her cheeks hangs. The skin on her body is even looser. 

Her 23-year-old mother Yang recalls her daughter’s skin was loose when she was born. ‘We didn't pay much attention, as we thought all kids were like that,’ she said.

'She looks like an old man,' said her grandmother Cao Niu (pictured). 'Last time I took her to visit a doctor, and another child was scared and cried heavily'

She added that pregnancy check-ups hadn’t indicated anything was wrong. 'And she was a 9lb baby – a big one,’ she said. 

Now 18 months old, Yuxin’s condition is deteriorating.

'She looks like an old man,’ said her grandmother Cao Niu. ‘Last time I took her to visit a doctor, another kid was scared and cried heavily.

‘I am reluctant to take her out, as people stare at her like an alien.’

Yuxin also has congenital heart disease, pneumonia and asthma, and spends much of her time at the children’s hospital in in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province.

Her hair has to be kept short so doctors can administer drugs through an IV tube and injections into her head.   

In the past year, the family spent more than 80,000 Yuan (around £8,000) on her treatment.

Despite her declining health, Yuxin’s family say she is a lively child. ‘She is quite active and smart and she imitates others’  facial expressions quickly,’ her grandmother said.

Cutis laxa is a disorder of connective tissue, which provides structure and strength to the muscles, joints, organs, and skin.

It is a rare disorder, thought to affect about 200 affected families worldwide. 

The term 'cutis laxa' is Latin for loose or lax skin, and is used to describe skin that is sagging and inelastic. The skin often hangs in loose folds, causing the face and other parts of the body to have a droopy appearance. 

Extremely wrinkled skin may be particularly noticeable on the neck and in the armpits and groin.

Cutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, joints, intestines, and lungs. The disorder can cause heart problems and abnormal narrowing or tearing of critical arteries. 

Those suffering from the condition may suffer from other internal problems such as hernias.

During childhood, some people with cutis laxa develop a lung disease called emphysema, which can make it difficult to breathe. 

Depending on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa can range from mild to life-threatening.
