A 23-year-old former graduate student at New York University has been accused of helping a former Delaware criminal prosecutor arrange a threesome with a 16-year-old boy.

Matthew Coogan, from Brandywine Hundred, Delaware, has been charged with two counts of sexual solicitation of a child and a second-degree conspiracy to aid former Deputy Attorney General Daniel Simmons in the rape of a Salesianum School student in March.

Simmons, 35, was arrested in May on four counts of fourth-degree rape in connection to the assault on the 16-year-old, whom he met through the popular gay dating app Grindr.

Right age: Coogan has not been charged with rape because under Delaware law people under the age of 30 are allowed to have consensual sex with someone who is 16 years old

Just days after his arrest, the prosecutor resigned from his post in the office of State Attorney General Beau Biden, Vice President Joe Biden’s son, after more than seven years on the job.

Mr Simmons remains free on $45,000 bail. He had Coogan are due back in court February 15.

Matthew Coogan, a recent graduate of a Master's program at the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at NYU, was not charged with rape because under Delaware law it is legal to have consensual sex with a 16-year-old if you are younger than 30. 

Scholar: Coogan was a graduate student at the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at NYU studying foreign intervention in Syria 

According to the 23-year-old’s indictment cited by Delaware Online, he allegedly solicited the teenager for sex with Simmons, thus aiding in the act of committing rape.

The case came to light in April when a student at Salesianum School learned about a classmate‘s sexual encounter on March 19 and contacted police.

When investigators interviewed Coogan, the man admitted that he and Simmons had talked about his desire 'to engage in a sex act with a younger person, with the target age being a high school age male,' according to the arrest warrant.’

Following his May arrest, the prosecutor also confessed to knowing having sex with a minor.

The 16-year-old victim told police that he and Matthew Coogan had exchanged messages of Grindr and agreed to have a tryst at Simmons' house in Pine Creek.

On March 19, Coogan allegedly picked up the teen from school and drove him to the prosecutor’s townhouse, where the two were joined by Simmons a short time later for a threesome.

During the group sexual encounter, the 16-year-old was quoted as telling his two partners: 'I'm only 16, take it easy on me.’
