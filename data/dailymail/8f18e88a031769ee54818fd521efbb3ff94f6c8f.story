Travelling on a city's underground system is never expected to be an exciting experience - rather a convenient way of getting from A to B.

But this could not be farther from the truth in the Swedish capital Stockholm, where artists have transformed the city's subway into a gigantic, kaleidoscopic art exhibition.

Around 90 of the city's 100 subway stations have been given a dazzling makeover by over 150 artists, who have been let loose over the last 55 years.

The results are spellbinding, transforming the subterranean transport system into a world of colour and visual stimulation, rather than somewhere to rest amongst the rats while waiting for your train to come.

The makeover has also helped to make the subway system - widely regarded as the most beautiful in Europe - into the world's longest art exhibition, measuring 110 kilometres (68.3 miles).

This series of breathtaking photographs captures the artistic beauty of the subway.

The system features a range of different artistic styles drawn from the art scene in Sweden's largest city over the last 55 years.

The first underground works in the Metro were kick-started by pioneering artists Vera Nilsson and Siri Derkert. Stockholm's first underground line opened in 1950 but the first art installation did not appear until 1957.

Two motions on art in the subway were
 submitted to Stockholm City Council in 1955, attracting cross-party approval and
 allowing almost 60 years of work to begin.

And it's not just static 
painting and sculpture on offer at the subways - art films have been 
shown at Skanstull metro station since 2004.

Into the fiery pits: The red paint on this station's bare rock walls creates an invigorating mood underground

Bus and train stations are also 
decorated, although the city's transport operator SL says that the art 
has 'heavy demands' place on it, as it must be 'washable, durable, 
weather proof and sometimes even have a functional role'.

And the benefits are not just to make
 the daily commute a little more pleasant; the company believes it also 
helps travellers find their way - and reduces crime.

The SL  website states: 'The art 
makes the stations perceived as more beautiful, safer and it helps to 
make the trip into something more than just a transport between two 
places.
