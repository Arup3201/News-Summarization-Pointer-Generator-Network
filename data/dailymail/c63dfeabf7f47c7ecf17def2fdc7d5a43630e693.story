When Neil Olson set up his Christmas tree before two of his sons went off to the Vietnam war, he vowed never to take it down until they returned.

After 40 years, it is still standing in his living room.

The 89-year old from Wausau, Wisconsin, has six sons ranging in age from the mid-50s to mid-60s.

But his eldest Barry, who lives in Washington state, was injured during the war and is unable to make the trip on Christmas Day.

The rest of his family who are married and have children still visit, but one day he hopes to have all of them together.

The tree that went up in 1974 is covered in a number of colorful baubles that have collected dust over time.

Tinsel is also draped over the needles that are still intact after nearly half a century. 

The lights are still up but Mr Olson hasn't turned them on since 1974, fearing they would 'blow up' like an 'atomic bomb'.  

Mr Olson told the Wausau Daily Herald: 'The needles are kept on for a reason. It's supernatural, I say. 

Neil Olson served in the Second World War and the Korean War. Several of his sons served in the military as well.

Speaking to the paper on Wednesday he said his plans for Christmas were to sit with his sons, drink beer and go to bed. 

One of his other sons Rich added: 'It's part of the furniture. It's like family now. I hate to take it down.'

Mr Olson added that having the tree there constantly reminds him of past holidays.

'I can see 'em sitting around there yet, opening presents,' he said.  

The tree is decorated with a number of baubles that have collected dust over the years as well as tinsel. He has not turned on the lights since 1974 fearing they would blow up
