Power company which left tens of thousands of customers without electricity on Christmas Day are due to pay out millions of pounds in compensation.

Southern Electric, who made a profit of £1.4bn last year, failed to get electricity to 19,500 users in south Hampshire, Surrey and West Sussex on December 25 due to flood damage.

On Tuesday afternoon it confirmed it would pay £75 compensation to every customer, regardless of how long the outage lasted, bringing its bill to almost £1.5million.

Power companies are facing payouts worth millions of pounds to customers after leaving tens of thousands without electricity over Christmas

UK Power Networks, who had 30,000 customers in Sussex, Surrey and Kent without power on Christmas Day have matched the offer - treble the legal minimum of £27 - costing them another £2.5million.

However the total bill is likely to be higher as customers without power for 60 hours are paid more, and are then paid again for every 12 additional hours it takes to get the problem fixed.

Southern Electric will be writing to every customer who is able to receive the payment to inform them, while UK Power Networks is asking customers to write to them if they think they are eligible.

Some UK Power Networks customers were still without electricity five days after the Christmas Eve storms, as the CEO Basil Scarsella admitted fixing power lines had taken so long because engineers were on holiday.

Meanwhile politicians have lined up to criticise the power companies' performance, with MP Tim Yeo confirming that bosses will be called before parliament in the new year to explain themselves.

He told the Telegraph: 'I'm very concerned about how long the network distribution companies took to restore power to thousands of customers. The Committee will call them in when the House gets back.

There were just four people left without power on Monday in Kent, but bad weather is now forecast for the rest of January raising fears of more outages

'I'm already concerned that these distribution companies are not properly scrutinised by Ofgem, despite being effectively monopolies. Their performance over Christmas was unacceptable.'

Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, said that energy companies had failed to prepare for the bad weather by sending too many staff away on holiday.

He branded the poor performance 'unacceptible' and said that bosses had let their customers down badly.

Under the law energy companies are required to pay £27 to any customer without power for 48 hours, and then pay another £54 for anyone without electricity for between 60 and 72 hours.

Customers are then paid again every 12 hours until the problem is fixed, up to a maximum of £216.

However UK Power Networks said last week that it would voluntarily treble the initial payout to £75 as a 'gesture of goodwill', with customers being paid £108 after that, up to a maximum of £432.

Today Southern Electric matched that offer, adding that anyone who experienced a power outage on Christmas Day qualified for the £75 payout, no matter how long it lasted.
