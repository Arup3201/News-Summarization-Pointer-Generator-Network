Few things in life frighten me, but dying before my time is one of them. To achieve my dream of longevity, I lead a relatively healthy life, exercising daily, drinking in moderation, eating plenty of fruit and veg, and — most important of all — shunning fatty foods including butter and dairy products to reduce the risk of heart disease.

Well, that’s turned out to be a huge waste of time! The truth is, I shall probably die at exactly the same age as my mum and dad, and I will have wasted decades on a virtuous eating plan based on a lie.

This week, we were told that the advice dished out by doctors in 1983 — that to avoid heart disease we must cut our fat intake drastically, and increase our carbs correspondingly — turns out to be based on flawed evidence.

Shockingly, medical experts have reversed their opinion and now say they find it ‘incomprehensible’ that millions of us were advised to alter our diets, because the conclusion that fats were bad was based on a small sample of ‘unhealthy men’. (Just as shockingly, women weren’t even included in the original survey!)

I can’t tell you how annoyed I am by this news, having spent all those years since 1983 eating slimy, flavourless, low-fat spreads, cutting down on meat and never roasting my spuds in beef dripping, completely taken in by ‘official advice’ from ‘government health advisErs’.

Drinking black tea, not eating trifle, spurning custard and never dripping cream on my crumble. I was totally brainwashed about butter, along with millions of you.

The dairy industry never recovered from the dietary warnings of 1983 — milk sales plummeted, along with those of butter, and supermarkets drastically increased the amount of shelf-space devoted to low-fat spreads, zero-fat yogurt and skimmed milk.

Unsurprisingly, the dairy industry is now in crisis, and in The Archers, poor Ed Grundy has had to flog off four of his cows because he can’t make a living from the herd, while Mike Tucker can’t find a buyer for his milk round.

It’s not surprising when on any given day you’ll hear yet another celebrity proudly announce that they’ve given up dairy as part of their healthy eating regime.

Dairy has become horribly, unfairly demonised — and all because of bogus medical advice.

Janet says that spreads such as Flora Pro-activ taste like 'taste like slimy muck'

But then, when it comes to lifestyle advice, why should anyone bother listening to the medical profession?

Doctors are usually over-weight, middle-aged men with flushed faces and paunches, although my own NHS doctor is the opposite. He’s a fitness fanatic, a fell-runner so scrawny he looks on the point of death every time I walk through the door.

He’s always got the fat-measuring callipers handy, to check my body mass index. (Another discredited method, incidentally, of measuring how near to death we are).

For years now, both Labour and Tory governments have decided to interfere and tell us what we should eat, what we should weigh, and how often we should exercise. Sod the economy, they seem to be thinking, let’s focus on the nation’s blood pressure! Politicians have become like the extra foster-mum we never wanted.

By the way, both my parents ate thick slabs of butter on white bread with every meal.

They loved salad cream slathered over their lettuce. They gorged on tinned ham, tongue, huge joints of red meat every Sunday, potatoes roasted in animal fat, and meat and offal at least five times a week.

Yes, we ate fish on Fridays — usually in batter from the chippy, with chips cooked in dripping — and the idea of a wholemeal grain or a low-fat vegetarian meal was a completely alien concept back in Fifties Britain.

They took sugar in tea, and salt was always on the table. Yet, both parents were as thin as rakes and walked for miles well into old age, even if they did smoke.

But then I regularly meet healthy pensioners over 80 who survive on full-fat milky tea and bread and butter, interspersed with the odd ciggie and a glass of beer or gin.

My generation of baby boomers decided we didn’t want to age like them or get wrinkly and stooped, so we adopted every life-extending fad going, starting with no saturated fat. I love the taste of butter — particularly on crumpets — but a packet of butter now lasts three months in my fridge.

It sits unloved on a special shelf, next to that other devil food, creamy Gorgonzola, which I only eat when I’ve had several glasses of red wine too many.

Full fat cheese is like a class A drug to me — a super-evil.

I am a total food snob, so how I ever persuaded myself that low-fat spreads were delicious is a mystery, no matter what twaddle Lulu claimed in her advertising campaign extolling the benefits of the Flora Pro-activ ‘cholesterol-lowering’ range. Let’s be honest, all these spreads taste like slimy muck. And now we’re told we have been smearing them over our wholegrain for no reason at all.

This strategy of demonising fats was shown to be a sham last year when the British Heart Foundation concluded that UK dietary guidelines on fat needed rethinking. And yet the government did nothing.

Common sense dictates that eating too much fat can’t be good for us, but the advice in dietary guidelines — which substituted carbohydrates for fats — just seems to have been scribbled out on the back of an envelope.

And if the levels of obesity now plaguing the population are anything to go by, the advice has been totally counter-productive.

Janet says full fat cheese is a like a class A drug to her and that Gorgonzola is reserved for when she's had several too many glasses of red wine 

My beef with all this is that it’s just tinkering around the edges.

Instead of promoting cookery lessons in schools (they’re starting this year at long last) and encouraging people to enjoy all sorts of food and use unprocessed ingredients, the government prefers to waste millions of tax-payers money trying to encourage us to change our behaviour using ‘nudge’ tactics like giving people vouchers for free slimming classes.

David Cameron said he would slash government advertising when he took office, but spent a whopping £90 million in the 11 months to November 2013, up from £64 million during 2013, and almost double what was spent in 2011.

We are bombarded with public health messages about ‘healthy eating’ in every ad break on telly. Change4Life was set up by Public Health England in 2009 and made a big expensive fuss about the benefits of eating five fruit and veg a day.

Last June, the National Diet and Nutrition Survey concluded that only ten per cent of boys and seven per cent of girls had heeded that advice.

Yes, a million people have downloaded the app, and 1.9 million families joined the scheme — but when it came to actually EATING fruit and veg, the average number of portions a day we consume remains at three — and, like the great Butter Scandal, experts can’t agree whether it should be five portions, or seven, or what even constitutes a portion.

As for me, I’m too set in my ways to change. My longevity breakfast will remain raw tomatoes or mashed avocado on a slice of heavy, seed-laden wholemeal bread, with chopped anchovies, slathered in olive oil.

I can’t remember what health ‘advice’ brought me to this point, but I’m not stopping now. Heaven forbid that in a moment of terrible weakness I might even start living dangerously and buy another packet of butter.

The moral of this saga? Eat a little of whatever you like, don’t listen to government busybodies — and remember that butter’s not only delicious, it’s also officially good for you.
