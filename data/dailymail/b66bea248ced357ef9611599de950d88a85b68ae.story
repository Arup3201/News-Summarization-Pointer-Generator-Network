David Cameron attended a high society wedding in Hampshire today while colleagues fought a final weekend battle to save the Union.

Labour headed the No campaign's last-minute push while the Prime Minister was mocked by the Yes camp for staying south of the border, where he spent the day with his wife Samantha's close family at a picturesque village church.

With five days to go before the referendum, he mingled with well-heeled guests in the Hampshire village of Northington, where Samantha's half-brother Jake Astor married Victoria Hargreaves.

Countryside: But the Prime Minister will return to business on Monday, giving a pro-Union speech to activists

The younger son of Viscount Astor and his wife Annabel, 33-year-old Jake is an Old Etonian who studied at Oxford University and works as a Mandarin-speaking investment analyst, while his wife is a consultant for a luxury brand.

The couple were thrown a pre-wedding reception in Downing Street two days ago, laid on by the Prime Minister's wife.  

They are part of the aristocratic Astor family, descended from the 19th Century fur trader and America's first multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor.

Today's wedding came just weeks after Mr Cameron faced criticism for returning to the Cornish surf hours after a crisis meeting about a British jihadi beheading journalist James Foley.

It will be back to business for the Prime Minister on Monday, but he is staying away from Scotland on this crucial Saturday and Sunday, despite polls showing the No camp is neck-and neck with Alex Salmond’s pro-independence campaign.

A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: 'If anyone finds them, could you send them to Scotland to help in our final push to helping us win a Yes vote. Every time they venture north support for independence gets a lift'

A poll today put the pro-Union camp on 54 per cent, but Yes campaigners insist there is everything to play for

Today a new poll suggested the Better Together campaign was holding the lead with 54 per cent of those who had made up their minds, but Yes campaigners insist there is everything to play for.

Much of the pro-Union fight is being taken up by the Labour old guard, with Gordon Brown and John Reid leading the effort to stop working-class voters backing independence.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has been in Scotland all week, is not expected to campaign this weekend.

And Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is also a no-show with just five days until polling day.

Independence campaigners today mocked Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg’s absence from the battlefield, claiming if they did turn up it would boost the case for independence.

A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: 'If anyone finds them, could you send them to Scotland to help in our final push to helping us win a Yes vote on Thursday.

’Every time they venture north support for independence gets a lift.'

Mr Cameron made a visit to Edinburgh this week, where he urged voters not to use the referendum to give the effing Tories a kick’.

He is due to make his final visit to Scotland on Monday.

The Prime Minister is expected to spend the weekend working on his final speech of the referendum campaign, to Conservative activists on Monday.

He will deliver a passionate plea to not to 'break up the family of nations'.

But the biggest battle is being fought in the west of Scotland, where Labour has launched a massive operation to stop its working class supporters from backing independence.

Senior Tories say almost all of their supporters are committed to vote No and it is down to Labour to secure their base.

In Glasgow former Labour home secretary John Reid joined Labour MP Jim Murphy for the conclusion of his 100 Meetings in 100 Days tour of Scotland.

Since June Mr Murphy has been travelling across the country and speaking to voters in town centres from atop an IRN-BRU crate to urge a No vote.

Hundreds of people gathered on Sauchiehall Street with Love Scotland, Vote No placards.

Mr Murphy said: ’I've lost most of my voice but I don't think we've lost the argument.

Prime Minister David Cameron has been attacked for returning to London during the final days of the campaign

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also faced criticism although their absence may help the No campaign

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been tasked with securing Scotland's Labour vote for the No side

’The nearer it gets, a lot of the undecided voters have looked into the precipice and they've stepped back.’

Mr Reid said: ’The arguments are coming down to two very simple questions.

’Do you want to retain Scotland's history, culture, control over its own affairs within a bigger state that allows us financial stability, economic growth and and the best of both worlds?

’Or do you want to go a separate route with all the dangers, which are now becoming obvious, to pensions, jobs, investment and security?’

As part of the Labour push, former prime minster Gordon Brown used a SPCA at an event in Kirkcaldy to say: ’I yield to no one in my patriotism and my pride in Scotland.

’None of us here should allow it to be said that anybody who votes no is less patriotic and less proud of our country.

’We are patriotic Scots. We've got a patriotic vision for the future.

Postal votes are already being counted in advance of Thursday's crucial referendum poll of eight million Scots

Nigel Farage on a visit to Glasgow urged voters not to destroy the Union because of their hatred of Tories

We're proud of our institutions. We're patriotic, we're proud of Scotland.’

Better Together strategists admit the spectacle of Mr Cameron jetting into Scotland to tell people how to vote risks angering those who have yet to make up their mind.

Last night UKIP leader Nigel Farage pleaded with Scots not to allow their ‘loathing’ of the Tories to destroy the Union.

But in a direct appeal to Labour voters, he urged them not to use the referendum as a chance to punish the Westminster politicians they hold in ‘contempt’. 

A Labour spokesman said: 'This is not and will not be Labour Party policy.'
