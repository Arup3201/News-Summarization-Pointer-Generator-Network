A police inquiry into a Maoist cult that allegedly kept three women as slaves for 30 years descended into farce yesterday when one of the suspects was told she would not be charged.

After spending nearly a year on bail, Chanda Pattni, 67, was told she would not be prosecuted over the allegations.

Her husband, sect leader Aravindan Balakrishnan, 73, who used the title ‘Comrade Bala’, remains on bail pending further inquiries into the slavery claims concerning three alleged victims – a 30-year-old Briton, a 57-year-old Irishwoman and a 69-year-old Malaysian.

police

The Maoist couple at the centre of the
 slavery probe – said to be originally from India and Tanzania – were 
held after one of the alleged victims contacted a charity, claiming she 
had been brainwashed into remaining in a political collective in South 
London for decades.

As 
detectives continued their inquiries into Balakrishnan last night, it 
was unclear whether there will be sufficient evidence to charge him with
 any slavery-related offences.

Since his first arrest, he has also been accused of serious sex offences – details of which the Met have not revealed.

Should
 he escape charges over the original allegations, which prompted a blitz
 of publicity, Scotland Yard is likely to face difficult questions about
 its initial handling of the case.

Soon after Balakrishnan and his wife 
were first arrested last November, senior officers talked in emotive 
terms about the victims’ alleged ordeals at the hands of a slavery 
‘criminal network’.

Detective
 Inspector Kevin Hyland, from the Met’s Human Trafficking Unit, 
described the case as ‘extraordinary’, saying officers believed the 
30-year-old had spent her whole life in ‘servitude’.

Another senior officer said police believed victims had been kept captive in ‘invisible handcuffs’.

This
 prompted Home Secretary Theresa May, other senior politicians and 
campaigners to speak out against slavery in Britain. Mrs May spoke of 
‘eradicating the scourge of modern slavery’ and described it as a 
‘personal priority’.

Mr Balakrishnan, who is accused of sexual offences, has been re-bailed until December

But 
within days, it emerged that the alleged victims had not been kept under
 lock and key and at least one talked freely with neighbours in Brixton.
 It also emerged that the ‘cult household’ was known to local 
authorities and that Balakrishnan and his wife were well known to the 
police.

Described as a ‘guru’, the economics graduate was said to have a
 band of devoted female followers under his ‘spell’.

Known
 as ‘Comrade Bala’, he came to police attention after setting up a 
communist squat, the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre, in Brixton in 1976 
where the couple ran their group, the Workers’ Institute of 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought, holding lectures and film 
evenings. He had been kicked out of the Communist Party’s national 
executive after his faction ‘attempted to put themselves above the 
discipline of the party’.

Balakrishnan
 and his wife were arrested following the rescue of the three women from
 their home in Brixton. The alleged victims were said to have found the 
courage to act after watching a TV documentary about forced marriages on
 October 9 last year, which featured an organisation called Freedom 
Charity, prompting the Irish woman to call its helpline.

The charity’s founder, Aneeta Prem, subsequently spoke about the ‘danger’ the women were alleged to have been in.

Scotland
 Yard confirmed yesterday that – on the advice of the Crown Prosecution 
Service – Miss Pattni would face no further action over the slavery 
allegations.
