Wholesome video bloggers who advise their fans about a variety of topics including lifestyle choices, fashion and video games are taking the internet by storm - with some earning over £20,000 a month for their online musings.

Some of the more high profile video bloggers, or vloggers, have up to 26million subscribers - with some of their posts watched by over 11million.

Some vloggers can earn around £4,000 for mentioning a specific product on one of their entries.

Others are raking in up to £20,000 for adverts placed on their YouTube sites, according to one digital marketing firm eight&four.

Zoe Sugg - a shopping and beauty vlogger who earns thousands giving advice to over 4million subscribers

Tanya Burr's makeup blog was so popular, she has now launched her own range of makeup

One of the UK's best-known 'vloggers' is 24-year-old Zoe Sugg - known online as Zoella.

With around 4.5million YouTube subscribers, Ms Suggs specalises in shopping advice - but also helps her fans on topics such as career choices and friendship via her weekly Chummychatter entry.

Ms Sugg, who is based in Brighton, told Monique Rivalland of The Times: 'After you go shopping and you discuss what you got with your friends - it's like that, but millions of people watch you doing it.'

Another high profile vlogger is Tanya Burr, 24, - who blogs about beauty. She has now launched a range of makeup, which is stocked in high street store Superdrug.

Ms Burr has around 10m views per month on her channel - which has almost 2m subscribers.

Speaking to MailOnline in March, she said: 'I'm not entirely sure how my YouTube channel has become such a success, but I think it could be to do with my positive, friendly personality.

'I think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as I'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable, I'm still just a normal girl despite my large following.

Alife Deyes - Zoella's boyfriend and fellow blogger. One digital marketing agency says some young bloggers earn up to £20,000 a month for adverts around their YouTube pages

'People say that when they watch my videos thy feel like I'm their friend and I love that. When I meet fans in the street I always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely.'

Other top beauty bloggers include Fleur from Fleur de Force who has 1,020,224 subscribers, The Chapman sisters AKA Pixiwoos, with 1,503,906 subscribers, and Lisa Eldridge with 793,528 subscribers.

Felix Kjellberg's blog about video games has 26m subscribers

Young women are not the only ones making their mark in the vlogging world.

Zoella's boyfriend Alfie Deyes, 20, has 2.1million subscribers to his Pointless-Blog - where he and friends set one another silly challenges. He and his girlfriend blog together as 'Zalfie' on occasion.

Lifestyle blogger Marcus Butler uploads new musings every Saturday to his 2.3million subscribers.

The 22-year-old regularly joins forces with Ms Burr and Ms Suggs to appear in postings.

But the trio's subscribers pale into virtual insignificance compared to video games blogger Felix Kjellberg.

The 24-year-old from Sweeden broadcasts commentary on video games under the pseudonym PewDiePie. He has 26.3million subscribers - with his videos viewed a total of 4,222,593,245 times.

Kate Ross, managing director of the digital marketing agency eight&four, says the rise of the wholesome blogger appears to be a reaction to 'booze culture' and 'sexulatisation' of teens.

She told The Times: 'It reflects more of a general trend among the younger generation.They seem to be reacting against booze culture. Teens can see sexualisation anywhere on the internet. This differentiates itself from all that.'

She added: 'They are commercially very savvy. For example, they agree to vlog about a product, Instagram it and then Tweet about it for a certain price.'

It's not just the young who are embracing the power of YouTube.

Peter Oakley became an internet sensation with his quirky and often heartfelt YouTube videos about life.

The prolific vlogger from Bakewell, Derbyshire, was catapulted into internet stardom when he uploaded a two-minute video to the site in August 2005.

In the footage - titled 'First Try' - the former serviceman explains how he 'got addicted' to watching YouTube videos - so decided to take up making videos to 'grumble about life in general.'

In the eight years that followed, the former Second World War radar technician uploaded a total of 434 videos to the site.

He sadly passed away aged 86 last month.
