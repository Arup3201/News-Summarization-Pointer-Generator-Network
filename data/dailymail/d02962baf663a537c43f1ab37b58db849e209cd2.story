Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo has completed his loan move to Crystal Palace for the rest of the Barclays Premier League season.

Arsene Wenger turned down Ligue 1 club Bordeaux to let the 21-year-old move to Selhurst Park, while Hull City and Queens Park Rangers were also interested in the France Under 21 international.

Wenger hopes Sanogo can gain the Premier League experience he needs after becoming new Palace manager Alan Pardew's first signing since leaving Newcastle United.

Pardew told Palace's official website: 'He's a young player with tremendous promise, somebody that I have tracked personally and this club has too so that fitted well.

'We have given him an opportunity, he needs to play more games and I think he's ready for that and he proved that at Arsenal. 

'It's tough to get in their team but he's closer to the starting action with us.'

Sanogo has made six appearances for Arsenal this season in all competitions with his only goal coming against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.

First-team opportunities have been hard to come by since moving to the Emirates in July 2013, but he hopes his move across London can provide more time on the pitch.

'When the Arsenal manager spoke with me about Crystal Palace I was very happy because I want to play more games,' Sanogo said.

'I think Palace are a good team, I watched the game against Tottenham and it was a great performance from the guys. 

'I hope I can help the club have a successful second half of the season.'
