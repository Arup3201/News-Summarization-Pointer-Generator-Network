The power may have shifted but — 42 years on — the scoreline remained the same as Sunderland and Leeds met for the first time in the FA Cup since the famous final of 1973.

Twenty-five places separated Don Revie’s cup holders and Bob Stokoe’s Second Division underdogs when they upset the Wembley odds thanks to the late Ian Porterfield’s goal and those heroes were back at the Stadium of Light yesterday.

More than four decades on and 26 positions divide the sides, with Leeds’ demise leaves them fearing relegation to League One.

In that respect, there was perhaps mitigation for the seven changes made by Neil Redfearn. Gus Poyet, however, believes a cup run can facilitate momentum in the league. 

To that end, Poyet should be applauded for naming a strong XI and won through to the fourth round courtesy of Patrick van Aanholt’s sweet strike.

‘We made a few changes (six) but it was a good team,’ said Poyet, whose side had not won at home since October 4. 

‘We needed to win at home and we need the cup. I love it. 

'I don’t think it’s a distraction playing football. If you think it’s a distraction then you should go to the casino or the cinema.’

Van Aanholt’s goal arrived on 33 minutes, a first-time shot into the bottom corner after Steven Fletcher had rolled the ball into his path.

The Dutch left back had not played for two months since dislocating his shoulder at Crystal Palace and Poyet admitted: ‘It was a big decision to play him. 

'If something happened to him then you would all be killing me. 

'But we didn’t think it was a crazy risk and he was probably the best player. We’ve missed him.’

Leeds could have nicked a replay when skipper Liam Cooper headed against the post in stoppage time.

Redfearn reflected: ‘I thought we were the better team in the second half.’

Leeds were backed by 5,200 travelling fans and former Elland Road assistant Poyet was impressed.

‘That shows the kind of fans they have and where they should be,’ he said.
