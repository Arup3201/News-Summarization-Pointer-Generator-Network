The self-proclaimed 'Painter of Light' Thomas Kinkade died of accidental acute intoxication from alcohol and an anti-anxiety medication, an autopsy report revealed late Monday.

The Santa Clara County Coroner's Office reported Kinkade's cause of death as 'acute ethanol and Diazepam intoxication' and manner of death as 'accident,' according to NBC Bay Area.

Diazepam is the active ingredient in name-brand drug Valium.

Kinkade, whose works captivated millions of Americans despite the scorn of many art critics, died in April at his home in Northern California at the age of 54.

The coroner’s report also said the painter suffered from ‘hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease.’

In layman’s terms, Kinkade had high blood pressure and thickened artery walls in his heart due to high cholesterol.

His brother told the San Jose Mercury News newspaper that the painter had battled alcoholism for several years and suffered a relapse before he died.

Patrick Kinkade said his brother had been burdened in recent years by a separation from his wife, financial troubles and the low opinion of his work by critics.

Thomas Kinkade was arrested for drunk driving in 2010, the same year his company filed for bankruptcy.

Art galleries reported a surge in sales of Kinkade's paintings following his death.

Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes

Mr Kinkade's scenes of country 
gardens and pastoral landscapes led to a commercial empire that was said
to fetch some $100 million a year in sales. The artist's paintings hang
in an estimated one out of every 20 homes in the United States.

A key feature of his paintings are 
their glowing highlights and saturated pastel colors.His works often 
portray bucolic, idyllic settings such as gardens, streams, stone 
cottages, and main streets.

The painter is notable for the mass 
marketing of his work as printed reproductions and other licensed 
products through his company The Thomas Kinkade Company.

The prices of his painting's range from $200 to more than $10,000. 

'Thomas Kinkade, the celebrated 
'Painter of Light' is one of the most widely collected and beloved 
artists of our day, ' his official website says.

'Each year millions of people are 
drawn to the luminous light and tranquil mood of Kinkade's paintings and
include his creations in their lives through prints, books, and other 
fine collectibles.'

The University of California Berkeley
graduate was a devout Christian and has said his inspiration comes from
his religious beliefs and that his work is intended to contain a larger
moral meaning.

'I try to create paintings that are a window for the imagination,' Mr Kinkade said on his website. 

'If people look at my work and are 
reminded of the way things once were or perhaps the way they could be, 
then I've done my job.'
