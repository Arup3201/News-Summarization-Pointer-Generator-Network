Two new videos reveal the terrifying moments during and after a gunfight between police and a 'deeply troubled' Texas gun collector.

One of the videos was recorded by neighbor Rigo Cisneros, a former Army combat medic whose skills honed in Afghanistan were needed at home when he rushed over to dying police constable Brian Bachmann and tried to save him.

Thomas Alton 
Caffall, 35, turned a weapon on Mr Bachmann, a 41-year-old married father of two, 
when the officer arrived at his house near Texas A&M University to 
serve him with eviction papers.

Chris Northcliff, 43, a bystander caught in the crossfire, was also killed. Four others, including three officers, were wounded. Caffall later died.

Good Samaritan: Neighbor Rigo Cisneros shot this video while he was waiting for permission to run over to the officer who was fatally wounded

Shooter: College Station divorcee Thomas Alton Caffall, 35, was 'deeply troubled', according to his mother Linda Weaver

The first video shows little, but reveals the piercing ring of several volleys of gunshots in the quiet suburban neighborhood of College Station, Texas.

The wail of sirens can be heard as the neighbor leads his wife away from the street and into the cover of their house.

The second video, recorded by Mr Ciseros, shows the grainy image of several officers running up to the house after Caffall was shot and disarmed.

'Do not move! Do not move! If you move, you are dead!' screams and officer as he approaches Caffall. 'Do not move! Do not move!'

Mr Cisneros, who emerged from his house when the gunfire started, can be heard asked a police officer if he can help.

'You got an ambulance here yet? I’m a medic,' he volunteers.

'C'mon ... every minute. He's been down for like 20 minutes,' he pleads with the officers, who is keeping him at bay.

The video ends with Mr Cisneros running toward the violent scene.

He told the New York Times that when he arrived at Mr Bachmann's side, it was already too late. He was not responsive and there was no pulse. There was a gaping wound in the officer's chest.

'I heard gurgling sounds,' he said. .

When medics arrived to help Mr Bachmann, police directed Mr Cisneros to help the shooter.

He said he saw bullet wounds in Caffall's thigh, foot and armpit. It was the wound in his abdomen, which showed signs of internal bleeding, that likely proved fatal, the former medic told the Los Angeles Times.

He was badly injured, but Caffall was alert enough to give Mr Cisernos a message.

Killed: Bachmann was the elected constable for Precinct 1 in Brazos County. He was killed in the shooting on Monday, as was civilian Chris Northcliff, 43

'Could you please tell the person I shot I’m sorry,' he asked of Mr Cisernos.

On Tuesday, a lawyer for Caffall's family said the divorcee was mentally ill, but would not elaborate on his condition.

'He wasn't the same kid that he used to be, let's just say that,' W Tyler Moore said. 'He was sweet, very bright, good sense of humor, just a good kid, a sweet kid. I've known him since he was 4 years old.'

The day of the tragedy, Caffall's mother said her son had been having emotional problems.

'He's been very deeply troubled,' Caffall's mother Linda Weaver told the Huffington Post.

She said that her son had been having mental health 'difficulties' in the past few years.

'The minute I saw the TV I knew it was him,' she said. 'I've been that worried about him.

'We are just devastated.'

Mrs Weaver was having trouble coming to terms with the tragedy.

'If you're going to commit suicide, why take all these other people with you?'

Caffall's sister Courtney Clark said the family was 'distraught'.

'Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and this is just a senseless tragedy,' she said.

'We are just distraught by the havoc that he has caused.'

Caffall's stepfather Richard Weaver described the 35-year-old as a 'ticking time bomb.'

'He was crazy as hell,' Mr Weaver said to Click2Houston. 'At one point, we were afraid that he was going to come up here and do something to his mother and me.'

He said that Caffall had quit his job nine months ago and said he would never work for anybody ever again.

On
his Facebook page, Caffall has posted multiple photographs of his 
weapon collection, including antique rifles and semi-automatic guns.

'No,
it's not an AK. It's a Czech vz. 58. Just picked it up today, can't 
wait to try it out on the range. :),' he wrote as the caption to one of 
his gun photographs.

'I just got a new toy!' he wrote on the caption of another one.

He lists his religion as Christian 
and describes himself as 'a cross between Forrest Gump and Jack Kerouac 
(without the drugs). I'm on the road, permanently.'

'God loves us all. We are all capable of redemption, if we are willing to change,' he says.

He
lists Emily Dickinson, Winston Churchill, Yoda and George Orwell quotes
as some of his favorites, as well as one of his own sayings.

'If you feed the bears, they come back,' he says.
