Joseph Edwards, 17, who had autism, was found hanged at his home in Berkshire after receiving a spam email saying he had viewed indecent images

A 17-year-old with autism hanged himself after opening a scam email which appeared to be from police claiming he had downloaded indecent images and demanding £100.

Joseph Edwards, an A-level student from Windsor, Berkshire, likely didn't understand that the message was fake because of his learning difficulty, a coroner said.

Police say it will be almost impossible to trace the fraudsters behind the 'crude' email , but believe it may have originated from abroad.

The 17-year-old was found hanged at his home by his mother Jacqueline who has since launched a campaign to make children more aware of the dangers from internet scams.

Battling through tears, she told the hearing at Windsor Guildhall her son had been a 'happy boy.'

She added: 'He was generally happy and had just started new friendship circles and was enjoying himself,” she told the coroner.

'He didn’t seem to have any worries known to me. I don’t think he really understood. He did suffer from autism. I’m not sure he would have really understood the implications of what he was doing.

'He wouldn’t have done anything to upset myself or his sister, not deliberately.'

Ms Edwards told the hearing how, after finding his body, she had run screaming into the street. 

The noise attracted a neighbour, truck driver Lee Jobson, who came to help, and called the emergency services. Police seized the teenager’s laptop, along with a note he had left.

Coroner Michael Burgess said: 'It seems that from examining the computer that there appeared to be some sort of scam on it.

'He had inadvertently clicked onto this and it seemed to be, according to the police, "a poor attempt at blackmail." It (his autism) may have meant he took it very seriously.'

People with the developmental disability often do not understand sarcasm or lies and take things very literally.

Detective Sergeant Peter Wall, investigating the scam, said it was very difficult to trace those responsible but that police believe it originated abroad.

It was thought Joseph received a spam email which demanded money and downloaded a virus onto his computer.

The message came with a Cheshire Police logo, despite the fact that he lived in Berkshire, which is served by Thames Valley Police.

A coroner said that because of his autism, Joseph likely took the message seriously and became distressed, despite police describing it as 'a poor attempt at fraud'

The scam wrongly claimed indecent images had been found in Joseph’s possession and he would have to pay up to prevent the 'police' taking things further.

Fearing causing his mother and sister Georgia distress, the traumatised young boy, who was studying his A-levels at Windsor Boys’ School, instead took his own life, the inquest heard.

A post-mortem investigation showed the youngster had died from asphyxia as a result of hanging.

'Joseph was subjected to a scam on the internet, a threatening, fake police link that was asking for money,' his mother said in a statement.

'He would have taken it literally because of his autism and he didn’t want to upset Georgia or me.

'The internet is an amazing thing, but it can also be dangerous and I want parents to make sure their children are aware of this sort of scam, especially autistic children, because they will not understand.

'Jospeh was a very loving boy. He had a quirky sense of humour, and was just starting to develop his confidence and in many ways he was a typical teenager, despite being autistic.

Joseph's mother, Jacqueline, has now set up a campaign to teach teenagers about the dangers of internet scams

'He was a sensible, calm, kind and gentle boy - those are all words people are using about him, but his friends have also told me they will remember him as a ‘crazy dancer.'

Joseph, a keen football fan, had attended a mainstream school, despite his autism diagnosis, and the family had been planning to travel to New York together to celebrate his 18th birthday.

Recording an open verdict into Joseph’s death, coroner Michael Burgess said: 'Taking all this evidence into account, I am satisfied that on the 6th of August you found him at his home in the hallway. 

'I’m not satisfied that he necessarily understood the implications that he would die from it. Although he undertook that action himself, his intention is not clear from the evidence.

'It’s what we call an open verdict. I’m sure and hope you will remember him for the better moments of his life than for the way that he died.'

After Joseph’s death, a Facebook page was set up called 'Fake Police Email Scam in Memory of Joseph Edwards.'

A statement said: 'On August 6 2014 Joseph Edwards, received a fake email scam from Cheshire Police (Ukash Scam) informing him that he had been visiting illegal websites, which also generated a virus locking his laptop.

'He was asked to pay a sum of £100 or face being prosecuted. These emails are sent on headed paper from police authorities on both a national and global basis.

'This message was designed to look extremely convincing due to the official police headed paper.

'Joseph, who suffered from Autistic Spectrum Disorder, was so distressed by the accusation and by the demand for money sadly took his own life.

'This page is set up for a plea for more action to be taken against such websites and for the prosecution of those responsible for them.

'Also to raise awareness of the dangers these sites present, not only to children but also to older people and many others may be vulnerable to this sort of extortion.

'We must do more to stop this, please share this to raise awareness. Thank you.'
