A video believed to show the four-year-old girl rescued from a Greek gypsy camp dancing as a toddler has emerged.

In the short clip the tot, thought to have been around one at the time, is shown twirling and dancing as a large dark-haired woman watches.

Frequently the smiling woman, whose identity is unknown, can be seen the grab the little girl, known only as Maria, as she staggers about, pushing her back into the centre of a sunny courtyard to continue her dance. 

Dancing girl: Footage has emerged of the mystery girl rescued from a Greek gypsy camp dancing as a toddler

The child is seen wearing a pair of pink shorts and a white tee-shirt as she dances for the camera

Dressed in a pair of pink shorts and a white tee-shirt, with a dummy in her mouth, the child seems content to perform for the camera.

Her hair appears darker than in the pictures which emerged following her release, backing up the theory that her hair had been dyed by her alleged abductors.

In the recent images the youngster has fair, almost white-blonde hair, but the tips of her plaits are a reddish-brown colour.

It was thought that relatives of the couple who had been 'raising' the little girl gave the video footage, which has been shown on Greek television station Alpha TV, to police investigating the case.

Maria was found last Wednesday in a Roma settlement in Farsala, central 
Greece, after a police officer became suspicious because her pale 
complexion and blonde hair stood out during a routine raid on illegal 
activities. 

DNA tests 
proved she was not related to the couple with whom she was living, and her nationality and the 
circumstances under which she left her real family remain a mystery.

A 
39-year-old man and a woman, 40, have been charged with abducting a 
minor.

Police have requested assistance from Interpol.

Found: The four-year-old girl, known only as Maria, was found living in a gypsy camp with a couple arrested and charged with abducting her from her birth parents

The
discovery of the blonde, blue-eyed girl, who police suspect may be 
originally from northern or eastern Europe, gives hope that Madeleine 
McCann may also be found alive.

Today,
the girl – known only as Maria – was safely playing with other children
at a house run by Greek charity The Smile Of The Child, which is caring
for her.

Photographs of the girl suggest her hair may have been dyed when she was younger, as the bottom half of her plaits are brown.

Maria
only speaks Roma but appears to understand Greek and is also being 
communicated with using sign language, according to staff at The Smile 
Of The Child.

Who is she? The four-year-old sparked one of the officer's curiosity as she is pale skinned and bore no resemblance to the other children or the couple who claimed to be her parents

One employee 
told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The little girl was terrified when she first 
came to us and didn’t talk at all, but she is now calm and has been 
playing with the other kids.’

Panayiotis
Pardalis, a spokesman for the charity, said: ‘It was obvious that she 
was not a Roma girl. She was afraid and under some psychological 
pressure when she arrived.

‘She was living under bad conditions and was very dirty, but is now safe.’

Charity
director Costas Giannopoulos said the child was undergoing medical 
examinations.

‘We are shocked by how easy it is for people to register 
children as their own,’ he told Greek television.

Police have been probing claims that missing Briton Ben Needham was spotted at the same Greek gypsy camp where Maria was found.

Ben's
mother Kerry Needham said she was 'delighted' at the news that Maria 
was recovered in Greece, the country where her own son was last seen.

Ms Needham, whose son
was just 21 months old when he vanished on the island of Kos in 1991, 
says she always believed her son, from Sheffield, was taken by gypsies.

She told ITV: 'My family and I are 
extremely delighted at the news that a four-year-old girl has been found
in a gypsy camp in Larissa, Greece.'We
have always believed that Ben's abduction was gypsy-related and have 
had a long ongoing inquiry in Larissa. We hope that the investigation 
into Ben's disappearance will now be looked at again.'Ben
vanished after travelling to Kos with his mother and grandparents Eddie
and Christine, who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of 
Iraklise.

Eddie Needham also
told ITV's Calendar News: 'We've always been told over the years it's 
impossible for gypsies to hide a European child, well this proves that 
it's not.

The youngster was discovered by authorities living in a Roma gypsy camp in Farsala in central Greece

'What I want now is for the British police to contact Larissa police and have those people questioned regarding Ben.'

Ben's sister Leighanna Needham, 20, 
said the discovery of Maria in the gypsy camp was welcome news for her 
family's fight for answers.

'It's given us great hope," she told Sky News yesterday.

'Obviously,
it's been a strong belief of myself and all my family that Ben was 
taken by gypsies for child trafficking or illegal adoptions and this 
case just shows that they can be found.'

A
witness who visited the grimy camp near Farsala, central Greece, has 
said he saw a child matching Ben Needham's description among the 
gypsies.

Ms Needham is now calling on the British Government to urge Greek authorities to investigate the claims.

Police believe up to ten more children found at the camp may be the victims of a trafficking ring.

Delphine
Moralis, secretary general of Missing Children Europe, said: ‘This case
is very unusual in that we’re looking for the child’s family, rather 
than the child.’

She said 
The Smile Of The Child, a member organisation of Missing Children 
Europe, have several houses in Greece where they take children ‘who have
nowhere else to go’.

Maria
was found just days after the Metropolitan Police revealed the results 
of a major review of the investigation into the disappearance of 
Madeleine McCann.

Comparison: The case bears a disturbing similarity to theories about the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann, who went missing on a family holiday in Portugal on May 3, 2007

Breakthrough? Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured on a BBC Crimewatch appeal) said they are 'genuinely hopefully' that police can make progress in the investigation
