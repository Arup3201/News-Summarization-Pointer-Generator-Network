They may not put themselves in the same aesthetic category as Ryan Gosling, Johnny Depp or even David Beckham, but the average man does believe he is better looking than Simon Cowell, Russell Brand, Wayne Rooney, James Corden, Michael McIntyre... and five of his friends.

Neither do men understand the appeal of Noel Fielding, Steve Coogan or Jason Manford, believing themselves to be a much better catch.

Meanwhile, one in five women believe their partner is better looking than David Beckham, and 30 per cent say he's more attractive than actor Gerard Butler, according to a study.

Most men also admit checking out their 
reflection at least five times a day - while one in four 
confess they have to fight with their partner for the mirror.

Moreover, a
cocksure 54 per cent of men even believe at least one of their friends'
girlfriends, wives or partners have had a soft spot for them, according
to a study.

Surprisingly, almost a quarter of men think they are better looking than their partner.

A spokesman for the iPhone app Celebalike, which commissioned the study into male vanity, said: 'Confidence can definitely come across as either vanity or arrogance. But we think confidence is great - and these stats show that most British men are full of it.

'We would probably expect to see men such as Rooney on the list, but we are quite surprised about Russell Brand, as we know a lot of women like him.'
