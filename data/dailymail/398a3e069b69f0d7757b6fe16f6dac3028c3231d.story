It's a religious requirement that Sikhs do not cut their hair so to keep their locks neat they don turbans, which they refer to as a Dastar.

The headgear is not an easy item to arrange, which makes the ability of Bhupinder Singh Thind all the more remarkable.

Mr Thind can tie a turban while driving a motorbike at more than 30mph.

He is known as the international turban coach as he can also tie one in under 20 seconds while blindfolded.

Mr Thind is hoping to raise the profile of his culture by working under extreme circumstances. Incredibly, he can tie six metres of fabric around a mannequin's head in fewer than two minutes while riding a motorbike with no hands.

Mr Thind from from Punjab, India, said: 'I wanted to do something to show off my culture in a unique way.

'I love riding my bike and I've been tying turbans all my life.

'Usually it takes between 18 and 29 seconds to tie a turban and a little longer when I'm driving.

'For me it's no big deal, but the reaction I get is unbelievable.'

Nicknamed Speedy, Mr Thind is hoping his extreme skills will help spread word of his turban tying classes as the traditional head dress comes back into fashion.

He said: 'Youngsters around the world show a keen interest in learning eye-catching ways of wearing their turban to provide a unique look.

'Of course, for members of the Sikh faith and many others worldwide, wearing a Turban is a key part of our identity and faith.

'That's why I am giving classes because I am going to make sure they stay in fashion for a long time.

'Maybe if I get Lady Gaga wearing one that would be nice – I really think it would suit her.'

Among the Sikhs, the turban is an article of faith that represents honour, self-respect, courage, spirituality, and piety.

TheKhalsa Sikh men, who adorn the Five Ks, wear the turban partly to cover their long, uncut hair (kesh).

The turban is mostly identified with the Sikh males, although some Sikh women also wear turban. The Khalsa Sikhs regard the turban as an important part of the unique Sikh identity.

Mr Thind loves riding his motorbike and is very quick when it comes to tying a turban so what better than to combine his two passions?
