Manchester United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was caught on camera apparently swearing in frustration as his side struggled to a draw against West Brom.

Woodward's rant was filmed after Albion defender Andre Wisdom hit a shot over the bar with the visitors 2-1 down at The Hawthorns.

The United chief was sat next to Sir Bobby Charlton in the stands and, as David de Gea took the resulting goal kick, Woodward appeared to swear.

The United executive vice-chairman continues to express his displeasure at the poor result

Some of the options suggested by those on social media included:

'Oh you f****** waste of money'

'Oh f****** hell, what is the point?'

'Oh f*** off where's he put it?' 

Within minutes social media was rife with suggestions over what exactly had been said (see right for some options). 

Daley Blind's late equaliser secured a 2-2 draw and will have lifted Woodward's mood, but the United chief is likely to feel his expensively assembled team should have won the game. 

Manager Louis van Gaal shared his boss' frustration, claiming his had been the better team and deserved all three points.

'It is two points lost,' said a clearly frustrated Van Gaal. 'I think we were the better team. I am very disappointed about the result. 

'I don't think West Bromwich Albion has created many chances, I think zero, and we gave the two goals away.

'We have created four chances in the first half and seven in the second half. I am happy about our playing style but not happy with the result.'
