Former care home manager Janet Tracey died at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge after a 'do not resuscitate' notice was placed on her medical file

Doctors have a legal duty to consult patients and their relatives before placing ‘do not resuscitate’ orders unless there are ‘convincing reasons not to’, the Court of Appeal said yesterday.

The court ruled that the human rights of care home manager Janet Tracey, 63, were violated when a DNR order was placed on her medical notes without  discussing it with her first.

The landmark judgment follows a lengthy legal battle led by Mrs Tracey’s husband David and paves the way for greater consultation of patients and relatives over end-of-life decisions.

National guidance already recommends consultation, but yesterday’s ruling confirmed for the first time that doctors have a legal obligation to do so under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

Grandmother Mrs Tracey had  terminal lung cancer when she was admitted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge, with a fractured neck following a serious car accident in February 2011.

Despite a poor prognosis, her family say she had ‘a strong will to live’ and ‘wanted to have every minute of every day’ for her four daughters and seven grandchildren.

Mrs Tracey had told doctors she wished to be included in conversations about her care, and even wrote a note to one consultant from her hospital bed which said ‘Please do not exclude me’ and ‘I will do my damnedest’.

So she was ‘distraught’ and ‘horrified’ to discover that a DNR order had been placed on her notes without her knowledge.

When Mrs Tracey objected it was cancelled by Addenbrooke’s staff, but it was reinstated days later following discussions with the family after her condition deteriorated, and she passed away on March 7, 2011.

Appeal court judges found Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge violated Mrs Tracey's human rights

Yesterday, Lord Dyson, Master of the 
Rolls, ruled the first DNR unlawful, and that the hospital breached Mrs 
Tracey’s right under Article 8 to respect for private and family life by
 ‘failing to involve her in the process’.

He said it was a human rights breach because ‘a decision as to how to pass the closing days and moments of one’s life’ clearly touches on ‘a patient’s personal autonomy, integrity, dignity and quality of life’.

Yesterday, Mr Tracey, 67, a retired engineer, said: ‘My wife spent her life looking after the elderly.

'She knew about the options and wanted to take part in discussions about her treatment.

‘It was extremely distressing for her when she found out about the DNR.

'We hope this will go some way to helping other patients. I feel relief that something has been done.’

Lord Dyson added: ‘Since a [DNR] 
decision is one which will potentially deprive the patient of 
life-saving treatment, there should be a presumption in favour of 
patient involvement.

'There need to be convincing reasons not to involve the patient.’

The court stressed the importance of the case as DNR orders affect most of the population ‘directly or indirectly’ because 68 per cent of the population die in hospital and 80 per cent die with such notices in place.

Kate Masters, 47, one of Mrs Tracey’s four daughters, said: ‘It was absolutely awful for my mum to find out that this decision had been taken without consulting her. We are really pleased with the outcome and we hope it will give some protection to other patients – that’s what my mum did not have.’

Current guidance – which is issued by the British Medical Association, the Resuscitation Council and the Royal College of Nursing – is now expected to be updated to reflect the ruling.

Dr Keith McNeil, chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Today’s ruling hinges on a specific point of law. There was no criticism of our clinical care.’
