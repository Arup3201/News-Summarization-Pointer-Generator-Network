Princess of Michael of Kent appeared on Daybreak on Tuesday to promote her new novel The Queen of Four Kingdoms

She won't wear Spanx, hates her granddaughter's name and eats fat-free yoghurt with cinnamon for breakfast while her cats feast on fresh chicken or ham.

Following a round of promotional interviews to push her latest novel it seems that there isn't much we don't know about Princess Michael of Kent.

The wife of the Queen's cousin, often nicknamed Princess Pushy because of her demanding demeanor, also recently admitted that she was horrified when told to downsize and move full time into Kensington Palace.

And today Daybreak presenters Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly had to stifle giggles as Her Royal Highness likened the Royal residence to a living in a terrraced house with a completely straight face.

Wearing a sharp blazer and stiff-collared white shirt as well as a collection of heavy jewellery Princess Michael was appearing on the daytime TV show to promote her book, The Queen of Four Kingdoms, a tale of 15th century European royals.

She explained that the book, the first in a trilogy, is a historical love story 'set in a time of Henry V, Joan of Arc, witches being burned daily, suspicion, superstition and arranged marriages.'

When asked about her own love story, a marriage which has lasted for 35 years, the mother of two gushed: 'I'm a granny!'

Princess Michael's son Freddie and his wife Sophie Winkleman had a daughter, Maud, in August. The princess wasn't massively impressed with her granddaughter when she first met her at a few days old though, declaring today: 'It was just a little thing, you know, awfully small. I'd forgotten how small they are. She has very long legs though. My two had little fat legs like a frog but she had long slender things that hung down.

'Now I get pictures almost daily. I live on Skype.' 

The royal talked about her new role as a grandmother to baby Maud, and also being neighbours with Prince George

There is also another new, very high profile baby in the 71-year-old's life, as she is a neighbour of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son Prince George.

Describing their living arrangements she told hosts Aled and Lorraine: 'Kensington Palace is a little bit like Harrods. There are lots of courtyards.

'One of the family called it the 'aunt heap' because all the aunts live there, it's like living in a terrace.'

'[William and Kate] have been living there for a while in a little cottage. William and Harry grew up next door to us so we have always seen them.'

Princess Michael and her husband Prince Michael, who is the grandson of George V, have been living in the West London palace since 2006.

Speaking
 to The Sunday Times Magazine this weekend, she recalled the moment when she was told
 she would have to sell their £5.7million 16th century mansion, Nether 
Lypiatt, in Gloucestershire to move full time into Kensington Palace.

They needed to sell the house meet the £120,000-a-year rent on their 
five-bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace, after being told they could
 no longer pay a subsidised ‘peppercorn rent’ of just £69-a-week.

She
 said: ‘Of course I miss the big gardens we had at our country house but
 it became very expensive to run... we couldn’t afford it.

‘For the first time that terrible word
 came into my life when our private secretary said, “Ma’am, you have to 
downsize.” It was the worst word I’d heard in ages.’
