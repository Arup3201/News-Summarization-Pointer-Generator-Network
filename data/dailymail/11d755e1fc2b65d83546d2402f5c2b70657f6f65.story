The Louisiana family behind Duck Dynasty is also attempting to build a political dynasty. A nephew of patriarch Phil Robertson has announced plans to run for the U.S. house.

Zach Dasher, a 36-year-old Republican, is looking to replace Representative Vance McAllister, who the famous family had previously supported.

McAllister. who ran on a platform of conservative Christian family values, landed in hot water in April after video emerged of the married Republican enjoying a long smooch with a female staffer - the wife of one of his best friends. 

The 40-year-old has been branded the 'Kissing Congressman' after the incident. He initially said he would not run for reelection this year, but later seemed to renege on that pledge.

Dasher, a pharmaceutical rep, has no previous experience in public office, but pledged to return God to the nation's capital

Dasher, a pharmaceutical rep with no experience in public office, pledged to bring God back to the nation's capital.

'I got to looking around at the problems in politics today, and what I see in Washington, D.C., is no God. There is no God. The elite political class thinks they can be running our lives,' he said in an interview with The Associated Press.

'I think there’s a vacuum in D.C. of people who understand where rights come from. Rights don’t come from men. They come from God.'

Dasher said he hopes to introduce new abortion restrictions, rollback ObamaCare and pass a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the budget every year.

In Louisana's rural, deeply conservative Fifth Congressional District, the family behind A&E's hit show 'Duck Dynasty' hold enormous sway.

Even as the show has slumped in ratings nationally after patriarch Phil Robertson made anti-gay comments, the wealthy family behind the Duck Commander brand of game calls has remained influential.

Scandal: Rep Vance McAllister was pictured enjoying a long kiss with a female staffer shortly after he was elected with the endorsement of the Duck Dynasty clan

When Rep McAllister ran for the special election for the Fifth District seat last year, he sought and won endorsement from the family.

If he decides to run for reelection, it seems, he will be facing one of the Duck Commander's own.

Dasher's mom is the sister of Phil and Silas 'Uncle Si' Robertson.
