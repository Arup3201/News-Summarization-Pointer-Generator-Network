Pope Francis has agreed to meet his first Falklands War veteran since his election last March.

He will receive fellow Argentinian Oscar Doria Fernandez privately at his Vatican home Saint Martha's House on Wednesday.

Fernandez, the youngest Argentinian Air Force non-comissioned officer to take part in the 1982 conflict, wants the Pope to bless two crosses due to end up at Falklands cemeteries where casualties from the two countries are buried.

Speaking before leaving his home in Gran Canaria ahead of his meeting with the Pope, Fernandez, 19 when war broke out the two countries, said: 'I want to tell the Pope there are new paths we haven't trodden and that we have to take, and that I'm committed to helping.

'I believe the Falklands issue can be solved but we have wounds to heal because the damage has been great.'

Pope Francis, the first Argentinian Pontiff, claimed the islands were snatched by Britain when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 2011.

He insisted those who died in the war had 'shed their blood on Argentinian soil.'

And in a mass to mark the 30th anniversary of the Argentinian invasion he said the islands were 'usurped.'

After he became Pope, David Cameron urged him to respect the overwhelming wishes of residents who days earlier had voted overwhelming to remain British in a referendum.

In a dig at the Vatican, where officials pumped white smoke from a chimney to announce Pope Francis had been chosen in keeping with tradition, he said: 'The white smoke over the Falklands was pretty clear.'

Argentinian president Christina Kirchner begged her compatriot to intervene in the row with Britain over sovereignty of the islands when they lunched together before his inaugural papal mass.

But Tory minister Baroness Warsi, the minister for faith, said later she was confident the Pope would not get involved.

And Nigel Baker, the UK ambassador to the Holy see, claimed around the same time he had received assurances from Vatican officials its policy of non-intervention in the dispute had not changed.

Fernandez, who has written a book about the Falklands war and is in close contact with British veterans of the conflict, says he was invited to meet the Pope through his publishers.

He said ahead of his meeting with Pope Francis he supported the idea of a 'diplomatic war' and dialogue.
