Sky News reporter Colin Brazier has apologised and admitted he 'got things wrong' when he rifled through dead passengers' possessions - including picking up a child's pink water flask - at the scene of the MH17 crash.

The presenter sparked outrage when he was captured in a live broadcast picking items – including a set of keys and a toothbrush – out of open luggage before saying: ‘We really shouldn’t be doing this, I suppose.’

Among his detractors were family members of a crash victim, who described his actions as 'sick' and Prime Minister David Cameron who called it 'completely inappropriate'.

Brazier has now issued a public apology for his actions at the scene of the 'warzone' crash site which have prompted 195 complaints to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

In his public apology and explanation of his actions, Sky News reporter Colin Brazier said his six-year-old daughter owned a drinking flask identical to the one he spotted at the crash scene

He wrote in the Guardian: 'At the weekend I got things wrong. If there was someone to apologise to in person, I would.

'Certainly it was a serious error of judgement. I acknowledged that and so did Sky. My bosses issued an apology by tea-time.'

During his live to air piece at the scene he spotted a victim's pink drinking flask that was identical to one possessed by his six-year-old daughter.

He then said he 'lost it' and broke out in tears while on air as he bent down to touch the victims' possessions.

The moment Brazier handled the luggage live on air has now prompted 182 complaints to broadcast watchdog Ofcom - with 72 of these lodged since yesterday evening.

Leeds University student Richard Mayne was one of ten Britons to die when the Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in Ukraine on Thursday.

Speaking from the family home in Leicester, Richard Mayne’s older 
brother Thomas, 24, branded it 'sick' adding: 'I think it's totally out 
of order. It's not on.'

Mr Mayne said: 'It’s sick and the worst example of news journalism which is sensationalising an appalling human tragedy.

'It's really hard for us at the moment. The magnitude of it all and the way it happened. You don't think this sort of stuff happens to you.

'We just want Richard to come home now, so we can say goodbye properly. We want to lay him in peace, see him one last time and give him a good send off.'

Last night Prime Minister David Cameron also condemned the reporter's actions branding it 'completely inappropriate'.

Sky News has refused to say whether disciplinary action will be taken against the veteran reporter, or whether there are any plans for him to return.

In a statement they added: ‘Whilst presenting from the site of the MH17 air crash, Colin Brazier reflected on the human tragedy of the event and showed audiences the content of one of the victims’ bags. Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on air.

‘Both Colin and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused.’

Brazier later gave a moving account of coming across scores of human remains at the site.

Meanwhile, an ABC reporter who has been criticised for touching clothes and debris from the MH17 plane crash has defended his actions saying 'it's not as though it's a crime scene'.

The ABC report was removed from its website for re-editing as Mr Williams told the broadcaster's PM show on Monday: 'I am guilty of picking up, touching a scarf on the ground'.

Mr Williams explained his actions, which have been branded inappropriate, by saying: 'There are piles of people's belongings that have just been collected and dumped on the roadside, they've been picked through and so it's not as though it's a crime scene, an uncontaminated crime scene there.'

He added: 'It's a very difficult scene to report on. Literally the evidence is everywhere you walk.'
