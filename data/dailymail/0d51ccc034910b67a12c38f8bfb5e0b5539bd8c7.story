Shaun Clee is chief executive of Gloucestershire's 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, and chairman of the Mental Health Network

With his staff facing pay cuts and redundancies, it might have been wise for Shaun Clee to show a little more sensitivity.

Instead, the NHS chief executive went on Twitter to show off his new pride and joy  – a £10,000 speedboat.

Some of his staff follow his account on the social networking site and were outraged and insulted by his ostentatious purchase, made during a summer trip to Cornwall.

Mr Clee, 52, chief executive of the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, has signed up to a consortium of health trusts reviewing staff pay and conditions in an attempt to reduce costs by 2013.

All staff earning more than £21,000 could face a pay cut, with reduced leave and bank holiday pay. Sickness and unsociable hours pay could also be slashed. Under his Twitter username Pictoontwit, he told his 407 followers: ‘Round-trip to St Austell, sea trial resulted in a new boat – oops!’

Tim Coupland, an NHS worker in Gloucestershire, then asked: ‘As in the purchase of a new boat?’

And Mr Clee replied: ‘I am afraid I have to plead guilty.’

The father of three, who lives in a £650,000 detached house in Worcester, went on to describe his purchase as a fast ‘day boat’ for inshore or river fishing.

He then posted a picture of what is believed to be his boat on his Twitter page, before adding: ‘Relaxing with a nice glass of something is definitely the order of the day.’

His 27-year-old daughter Ellen replied: ‘Nice, but we were hoping for something we could holiday on!’ Mr Clee responded: ‘That sounds like a lottery win wish.’

'Oops!': This picture tweeted by health trust boss Shaun Clee is believed to be the boat he purchased after a trip to Cornwall

As boss of the trust, which provides mental and social healthcare in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, Mr Clee earned between £140,000 and £145,000 last year.

The boat in the picture is a Raider Boats 16 Cuddy, believed to be about 12 years old and worth around £10,000.

John Nicholson, managing director of Raider Boats UK, said: ‘The 16 Cuddy is purely a leisure fishing boat and this particular model could reach up to 30mph, maybe more.’

Mr Clee’s gaffe stunned workers who face an anxious few months to discover whether their pay will be slashed.

Employees who fail to agree to the proposals could be made redundant and forced to sign new terms of employment.

'Regretful': Mr Clee's tweets about his new boat were met with anger from some staff at the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust

Chris Moore, co-ordinator for the local campaign group Stroud Against The Cuts, said: ‘At a time when NHS staff are being told their pay and conditions are under attack, it is outrageous that management can behave in this way. It shows a complete arrogance of management.’

A worker at the 2gether Trust, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘It seems insulting to people who follow him. I believe it shows poor judgment.

‘Staff want a leader who they can look up to and admire. People are absolutely incensed. You shouldn’t put it in other people’s faces.’

Mr Clee, who is married to wife Sarah, has 32 years experience in the NHS and moved into management in 1990.

A spokesman for the 2gether Trust said: ‘The timing of the message on Mr Clee’s Twitter feed was regrettable as we appreciate staff have concerns around our membership of the pay consortium.’

He added that there were no formal proposals to consider and discussions with staff would continue.
