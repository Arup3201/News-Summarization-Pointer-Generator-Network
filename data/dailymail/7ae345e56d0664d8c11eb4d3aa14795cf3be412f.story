A nine-year-old boy has died after being crushed by his grandfather’s horse when it fell on top of him.

Kaian Burford was enjoying an afternoon riding with his brothers and cousins when the accident happened.

The horse suddenly reared up twice and before falling backwards with Kaian still clinging on. It then landed on top of him.

At first Kaian’s grandfather, John, believed he had just been winded.

But his nose began to bleed and he collapsed moments before paramedics and his mother, Joliene Burford, arrived at the field in Markfield, Leicester.

Despite the desperate efforts of the emergency services, Kaian was pronounced dead at the scene.An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned.

Joliene, 32, paid tribute to her son today, describing him as her 'little smiler'.

She said: “He loved life and was keen to be friends with everyone.

'People would call him "little smiler" and everyone always said he was a little gentleman. 'Nothing fazed him and he would have time to talk to anyone. He was a lovely boy.

'He wanted to be friends with everyone he met, and everyone he met loved him - they adored him.

'The house already seems empty without him and it’s never going to be the same.'

Joliene, of Ratby, Leicester, said her father was leading the horse, which was on a long rein, in figure of eight shapes in the middle of the field when the tragedy occurred last Sunday.

She added: 'It was all a complete blur, with paramedics and police and everybody coming and going.

'It didn’t seem real. It still doesn’t. I half expect him to come running in the door with his big grin on his face shouting, "just kidding, Mum".'

Kaian also leaves his dad, Craig, sisters Beth, 16, and Piper, four, and brothers Cody, 15, and Kory, 11.

He was well known in the local area for rollerskating to school every day, and for his love of BMX riding at a nearby track.

Andrew Pridmore, head teacher at Elizabeth Woodville Primary School, where Kaian was in Year 4, said staff and pupils were 'devastated' by his death.

He added: 'Kaian was an absolutely delightful child with a truly infectious smile He had an endless enthusiasm for everything he did.

'Everyone was his friend and everyone remembers the fun that Kaian always brought with him.

'He really had that extra special sparkle. We will miss him hugely.'

Mr Pridmore said the school’s vicar and youth worker were talking to children to help them understand what had happened.

He said: 'We will obviously continue to support the children in the coming weeks and months as we try to cope with this devastating loss.'

A spokeswoman for Leicestershire Police said: 'Officers were called to a farm in Markfield following a report that a child had fallen from a horse and had been crushed, causing fatal injuries.'All indications are that it is a tragic accident.'

Kaian’s family has asked that, instead of buying flowers, anyone who wishes to pay tribute to him send a donation towards two memorial benches they hope to install - one at his school and another at the BMX track, in Groby, Leicester, where he loved to ride.
