Two care assistants face jail after being found guilty of mistreating a dozen severely disabled patients in their care.

In a series of vicious attacks James Hinds, 59, and Susan Murphy, 43, slapped people around the head, physically dragged someone to the toilet, and even locked one woman in a cupboard, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

The pair worked at the  Solar Centre at St Catherine’s Hospital in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, where patients who were blind and physically disabled were abused and tormented.

Hinds was found guilty of 10 counts of ill-treating patients and Murphy was found guilty of 15 counts.

Hinds and Murphy were ill-treated 12 different outpatients between them at the centre.

Hinds was acquitted of nine further charges and Murphy was cleared of 
five further charges after the jury of five men and seven women 
deliberated for two days.

After a month-long trial Judge Rosalind Coe told them they will be sentenced on June 14.

She said: 'You are both fully aware that custodial sentences are the likely outcome.'

Both were given conditional bail but were remanded in custody until 
their passports could be brought to the court and surrendered after the 
judge heard they had been living in Spain.

Another care assistant, Julie Burge, 48, was cleared of all charges she faced as was physiotherapy assistant Michael Barnard.

Shameful: The attacks happened at the Solar Centre at St Catherine's hospital in Doncaster, which should have been a safe haven for users

All those involved are extremely vulnerable adults, with limited communication abilities and a range of physical disabilities including blindness.

Many of the attacks involved patients being slapped and hit around the head.

Hinds threw one man into a wheelchair, dragged another to the toilet and hit another with a microphone.

Wrong: The pair were guilty of a combined 25 counts of abuse, which included the pushing, hitting and dragging of patients

Murphy locked one woman in a cupboard, the court heard.

Prosecutor Sarah Wright told the court at the beginning of the trial: 'James Hinds also smacked Michael Kime around the face and head after Michael Kime had hit out at him.

'He pulled him up by his hair and dragged him across the floor.

Miss Wright told the jury that Hinds would regularly grab the cheeks of Robert Kirsopp and slap him.

Mr Kirsopp, who is in his 40s, has Down’s syndrome, autism and dementia.

The court heard that Hinds also pricked Mr Kirsopp with a needle during a Christmas stocking-making session.

All the incidents happened in a period between January 2005 and March 2007.

Miss Wright told the jury the patients at the Solar Centre exhibited a range of challenging behaviour and had severe problems.

She said: ;They were vulnerable and not able to stand up to those who abused them.'

The prosecutor said a number of patients suffered 'physical assaults, threats, improper handling and degrading treatment'.

Miss Wright said Hinds and Murphy created an atmosphere at the centre which was intimidatory.

She said Hinds in particular was a 'very dominant character who came across as a bully' and who talked about 'sorting them out' in relation to the patients.

The police were called in after one member of staff decided to leave in March 2007 and made formal allegations about the mistreatment of patients.

The Solar Centre is run by Rotherham, Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust (RDaSH).

Scene: Both worked St Catherine's Hospital in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, were they hurt the vulnerable people they were meant to care for

Outside court, Dr Nav Ahluwalia, executive medical director for RDaSH said: 'We fully apologised to service users and their families at the time of the incidents and we apologise again today for the actions of the individuals that have been found guilty.

'The trust took immediate action as soon as we were made aware of the situation in 2007 and worked with South Yorkshire Police in their investigation into this matter.

'The trust has implemented improvements to the learning disability service at this centre to minimise the risks of such incidents happening again.

'We will not tolerate staff mistreating service users and have reinforced our channels of communication to ensure that staff, service users and carers report suspected abuse so that we can take action.'

Dr Ahluwalia added: 'We have a number of ongoing civil claims, which are confidential, and so the trust is not making any further comments.'
