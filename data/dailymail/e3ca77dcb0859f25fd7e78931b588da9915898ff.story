A hole-in-one is reward enough for every golfer on the planet, but the prize being offered for an ace at the KLM Open this week is simply out of this world.

The first player to get down in just one stroke on the 163-yard 15th hole at the Kennemer Golf & Country Club will quite rightly feel over the moon - because they will bag themselves a trip into space.

It is the first time such a prize has been offered at a golf tournament. A life-size model of the spacecraft (a Lynx Mark I) that will take the winner into orbit will be displayed next to the 15th green throughout the tournament.

'With this prize we wish to create awareness among the public that space is now also accessible for everyone,' said Michiel Mol from XCOR Space Expeditions, who have offered the prize worth around £100,000. 

'Journeys into space can be made starting from the end of 2015. We already have 300 bookings.'

Among those hoping to win the prize this week in Zandvoort, which is just outside Amsterdam, include former Open champions Darren Clarke and Padraig Harrington, England's Paul Casey, home favourite Joost Luiten, and Miguel Angel Jimenez.

But whether the colourful Spaniard could stomach tubed space food rather than his beloved rioja wine is doubtful.

The KLM Open winner may not quite join that illustrious list of stars in the golfing firmament - but the first man to shoot a hole-in-one will be blasting off, rather than teeing off, sometime in the near future.
