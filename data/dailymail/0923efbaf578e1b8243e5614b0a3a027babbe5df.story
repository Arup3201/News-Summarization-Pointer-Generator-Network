Sam Allardyce has fired a warning to full back Aaron Cresswell - whose been linked with a move to Manchester City - that the grass isn't always greener and he should look at Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair as examples.

The West Ham star has had a fine debut season in the Premier League, with a number of big clubs circling him for a possible summer move.

But Allardyce believes that City's previous British purchases speak volumes and that the 25-year-old should remain where he is.

He wrote in his Evening Standard column: 'What makes players like him attractive to big clubs is that he is home-grown and squads must have eight of those in the Premier League.

'Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair, for example, both spent time at City but did not play a great deal.

'They're featuring more regularly now, for Sunderland and on loan at Aston Villa respectively, but the decision for a player like Sinclair is would he be willing to join another club on a permanent deal if it meant less money?'

The left back scored a stunning free-kick last weekend against Stoke, as he showed his attacking prowess, as well as his defensive solidity. 

It remains to be seen if Cresswell will be at the club next season but with an England call-up being touted, West Ham may face a tough task of keeping their prized asset. 

Allardyce will be praying he can keep his prized asset from the clutches of the big clubs such as City
