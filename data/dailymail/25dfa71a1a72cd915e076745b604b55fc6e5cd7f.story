Arsene Wenger has promised to back FA chairman Greg Dyke’s attempts to clean up football’s image and revealed how he sometimes has to silence himself to stop his touchline rage.

Dyke has this week promised action to stop the intimidation of officials which he claimed had become ‘pretty scary’ after seeing the images of Chelsea players surrounding Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers.

‘He has my complete support,’ said Arsenal boss Wenger. ‘We all have to respect the referee and make their jobs as easy as possible. It’s difficult enough for the referees — they are criticised a lot, and I include myself. I do remind my players but I don’t think we have a problem with that.

‘We have never been reproached so on that front I don’t question myself too much. I question myself on my individual behaviour, that’s true.’

Wenger is often quick to let off steam at the fourth official and added: ‘Even sometimes at half-time I think, “Come on, stop that, my friend”, you know? And I think in the second half I will not say a word to him any more.

‘Sometimes it helps you to get your frustration out but I don’t think it is right, honestly. That doesn’t mean I don’t do it. I do. I’ve looked back on the tapes sometimes.’

Wenger also fears the officials are getting drawn into the thick of the action when they could be more peripheral.

‘I have spoken about this with referees,’ he said. ‘Maybe they are too close today because sometimes they are in the way of the pass. I can show you situations where they hide the vision of the pass. Because they are so directly involved they are surrounded sometimes when they should keep a bit of distance.’

Wenger admits there are times when managers like to see their players showing desire and unity but agrees with Dyke and UEFA president Michel Platini, who is also investigating ways to banish the problem in European games.

‘We want everybody to be respected and the referees are part of everybody,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘What we have to do is respect the decisions. The referees know the worst offenders but I like to think it doesn’t work. Referees are prepared for that nowadays. They are warned and they can deal with it.

‘I agree completely that you want players to be ready to fight for each other. How far does that go? You have to draw a line somewhere. You cannot go after every decision of the referee.

‘In rugby it didn’t exist. Unfortunately since they have become professional I have seen signs of them starting to question the decisions of the referees. So it may be a result of the pressure of the professional game.’
