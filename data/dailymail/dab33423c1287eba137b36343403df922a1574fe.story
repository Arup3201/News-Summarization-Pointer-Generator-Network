Jailed: Ashley Anderson is accused of having sexual contact with four of her students

A former math teacher in north-central Iowa has pleaded not guilty to allegations that she had sexual contact with four teenage students.

Ashley Anderson, 24, of Ackley, could face trial as soon as January 15.

Anderson has been charged with four felony counts of sexual exploitation by a school employee.

Each carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.

Anderson has resigned from her job as a math teacher at Aplington-Parkersburg High School.

A criminal complaint in Butler County says Anderson sent nude photographs of herself to the students and had sexual contact with them, including intercourse with one, according to The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier.

She also performed oral sex on three other students, according to the complaint.

The boys ranged in age from 16 to 18, and court records say the alleged incidents occurred during the 2011-12 school year.

Police said they received information that Anderson had sexually abused a teen who confided in a friend at the high school.

A fellow teacher heard about the allegation and contacted police, KETV reported.

Anderson, who served as the faculty adviser for Students Against Drunk Driving and the prom committee, is alleged to have begun a relationship with an 18 year old who was in her math class.

She is alleged to have had sex with the teen at his home.

The criminal complaint charges she had 
oral sex with a 16-year-old junior who served on the prom committee and a
16-year-old sophomore.

A fourth relationship with a 17-year-old student included a kiss on a gravel road after track practice last spring and continued after he graduated from the school, the complaint says.

In each case, 'Anderson admitted to the conduct,' according to the complaint, which said the relationships spanned from August 1, 2011 to June 30.

In a statement released shortly after the complaint was filed, Aplington-Parkersburg High School said: 'We can affirm that our students will always be our first priority and that we have followed all school policies on matters such as this and that the school cooperated fully with the police investigation,' the statement said.

Anderson had been arrested, but posted $5,000 bond and was released from the Butler County Jail.
