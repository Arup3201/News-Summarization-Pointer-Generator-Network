Karen Henshaw, 70, burst into song during her final day on the bench at Blackpool Magistrates' Court

A long-serving magistrate forced to retire due to her age chose to go out with a bang by bursting into song on her final day in court.

Karen Henshaw broke into her own version of ‘Nobody Loves A Fairy When She's Forty’ – changing the lyrics to ‘Nobody wants a JP when she's 70’ – on her last day on the bench at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court.

The experienced JP, who has worked at the court for the last 15 years, received a round of applause for her performance, which came just minutes before the first defendant was brought into the dock.

Mrs Henshaw, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, is being forced to give up her court duties because the Government stipulates that it is mandatory for all magistrates to retire at 70.

However, not wanting to slip out of the courtroom quietly, the former civil servant chose to burst into song after she was handed a certificate to thank her for her time working for the justice system.

In today's tongue-in-cheek performance, she sang: 'It seems this old JP is not wanted now.

'Nobody wants a JP when she's 70. Nobody wants a JP when she's old.

'She may still have her faculties but that is not enough.

'They like their bit of justice from a younger bit of stuff.' 

The song went on: 'For years I have sat on this bench.

'I've sentenced man and sentenced wench.

'I can't do all I did, I am satisfied because...

'I would rather be a has been than a never was.'

As the performance came to a close, the courtroom erupted into a round of applause and the first defendant – who was facing a charge of assault – was brought into the dock.

For years a magistrate I have been

Had justice done and justice seen

Bat alas, I'm getting on the years have flown somehow

And it seems this old JP is not wanted now

Nobody wants a JP when she's 70

Nobody wants a JP when she's old

She may still have her faculties but that is not enough

They like their bit of justice from a younger bit of stuff

When once your big brown eyes have lost their glitter

And you voice has turned from gruff instead of bold

Your JP's days are ending when your hands have started bending

Nobody wants a JP when she's old

For years I have sat on this bench

I've sentenced man and sentenced wench

I can't do all I did, I am satisfied because

I would rather be a has been than a never was

Speaking afterwards, Mrs Henshaw, said she chose to sing on her last day because ‘it’s always fun to do something a little different’.

She also said that although the song was tongue-in-cheek, she wanted to make the point because she felt ‘quite able to carry on’ in her role.

She told The Telegraph: ‘I don’t feel past it at all. I admit - a part of me would love to stay on because I feel I can still do the job, and I have a lot of experience.

‘And I do agree there has to be a cut off, but I don’t see why it can’t be at 75 rather than 70.’

As well as the assault case, Mrs Henshaw also dealt with cases of an assault with a weapon, a breach of an anti-molestation order and a breach of an Asbo during her last day.

Frank Shipway, chairman of the bench at the Blackpool court, paid tribute to the hard-working JP.

He said: ‘Karen has played a formidable role in promoting the work of the magistracy.

‘In all aspects of court life she will be nigh impossible to replace.

‘The decision that magistrates should retire at seventy was made at Government level.’

Another colleague added: ‘I have heard of the singing detective but never the singing magistrate. 

'It took us by complete surprise but she has a lovely voice.’
