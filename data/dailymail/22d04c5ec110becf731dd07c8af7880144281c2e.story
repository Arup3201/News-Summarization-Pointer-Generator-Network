A New Hampshire woman got a surprise at a Burger King drive-thru: a bag full of cash instead of food.

Janelle Jones says she discovered on the way home that the bag did not contain the sweet tea and junior spicy chicken sandwich that she had ordered Friday afternoon at the Rochester fast-food restaurant.

Foster's Daily Democrat  reports that Jones called her husband and they decided to return the $2,631, which was a Burger King bank deposit.

Would you like two grand with that? Janelle Jones (right) ordered a chicken sandwich at Burger King on Friday and got a bag full of cash instead. About an hour later, she and husband Matthew (left) returned the bag 

Whoops: Above, the Burger King restaurant where Jones was accidentally given a bag of cash on Friday in Rochester, New Hampshire 

Matthew Jones says the couple briefly considered keeping the money, which they certainly could have used. But he says he and his wife are Jehovah's Witnesses, and that 'Jehovah sees everything.'

They said the money was split between two deposit bags, with a loose $100 bill as well. 

The couple returned the money to the restaurant about an hour later and were met with extremely thankful employees.  

The newspaper reports that the restaurant confirmed the couple's account but had no comment on it.

'One person said "they were going to get fired" so it felt good knowing we helped them keep their jobs,' Janelle told the paper in an email. 

'A manager told me they would give me five free meals,' Janelle added. 'The manager said he talked to the corporate office and they said to tell me "thank you."'
