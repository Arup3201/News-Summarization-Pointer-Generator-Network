A new 'reservation scalping' website which makes last-minute restaurant bookings under false names before selling them for up to $12 each has caused outrage.

ReservationHop.com is the latest entrant in the pay-to-play booking wars, buying up tables at popular San Francisco restaurants and selling them back to customers for a $5 to $12 fee.

While the creator says he's helping users get a spot at in-demand eateries, critics claim the site is 'unethical' because it makes money off a free service and could damage businesses if bookings aren't sold.

Richie Nakano, owner and head chef of Japanese restaurant Hapa Ramen, said the website is 'disgusting and hurtful to restaurants that already operate on razor thin margins'.

'An
 app like that, while not breaking any rules or laws per se, has the 
potential to be hurtful to small businesses that rely on having a 
reservation book full of diners that actually show up,' he said in an email to Valley Wag.

'What happens to 
the reservations that no one winds up buying? This is a perfect example 
of tech trying to 'disrupt' something without thinking of the 
consequences.

'I hate this idea.

'It's awful and selfish and if it was my 
restaurant I would check that site everyday to see if my place were 
listed there so I could delete those reservations.'

ReservationHop.com creator Brian Mayer said he developed the website, which applies only to San Francisco restaurants, after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito.

He said he cancels reservations that aren't purchased four hours in advance and that 'in the interest of ethics and fairness', he wants to talk to restaurants about working with them directly.

Twitter users have slammed Mayer as self-interested and 'sleazy'. 

Observers have noted the website could make it harder for diners who don’t want to use ReservationHop.com to 
get a reservation, and have compared it to apps that allow 
users to sell street parking.

Similar apps are available in New York for everything from spaces in line to buy cronuts to table reservations.

Reservation apps for New Yorkers include:

Killer Rezzy- restaurants in New York and The Hamptons

Resy - New York restaurants

Shout - everything for theatre shows and cronuts to restaurants

Zurvu - restaurants

Others have commented that the website capitalizes on and exploits a free service to the detriment of customers and restaurants.

Beyond Twitter, Josh Ong at The Next Web described the idea as 'sleazy' and as 'tech enabled scalping'.

After receiving a torrent of abuse for his website, Mayer defended himself on his blog in a post titled, 'How I became the most hated person in San Francisco, for a day'.

'I built 
this site as an experiment in consumer demand for a particular product, 
and the jury’s still out on whether it will work...,' the University of Chicago history graduate wrote.

'Reservations
 aren’t free.

'Restaurant tables are limited, in high demand and people 
wait a good long time as walk-ins to get them.

'Reservations take time and planning to make and the restaurant assumes an opportunity cost from booking them...

Backlash: Twitter users, including Selena Larson (pictured), are outraged that startups like ReservationHop.com are capitalizing on services that have always been free

Backlash: Twitter user Mat Honan (pictured) has labelled startups such as ReservationHop.com 'irresponsible' and 'sleazy'

Backlash: Observers and restaurant owners say ReservationHop.com puts businesses in San Francisco at risk if it fails to sell bookings

'What about ethics? We are talking about an asset that most people don’t think about having a value. ... 
If someone does pay for it willingly, is it really unethical?

'The 
consumer has made a choice, the reservation stands, the restaurant gets a
 table filled as planned, and I have made money for providing the 
service.

'That seems perfectly ethical to me.'

Selling services that would otherwise be free has becomea trend in the startup world, with several new parking apps allowing users in crowded neighborhoods post when they're about to leave a spot and charge someone for the opportunity to take it.
