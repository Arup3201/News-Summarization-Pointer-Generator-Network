Newly published research suggests that one of the main reasons people enjoy smoking marijuana is because it helps them combat intense feelings of social exclusion.

Rather than simply getting high for the heck of it, a research team led by University of Kentucky psychologist Timothy Deckman has found  that cannabis relieves not only physical pain but also emotional pain.

As their starting point, Deckman and his team used two recent pieces of research. One that found the pain of social exclusion is more intense than previously thought, and another that revealed physical and emotional pain travel similar pathways in the brain.

This second piece of research was uncovered after tests found the pain killer Tylenol had helped reduce the pain of social rejection and existential angst in test studies.

Since marijuana works through similar brain receptors, Deckman's researchers wondered whether pot could similarly soften the pain of exclusion, reports Pacific Standard. 

One experiment that helped prove their theory involved surveying more than 5,000 Americans about their level of loneliness, their marijuana usage (if any), and assessed their mental health and feelings of self-worth.

Unsurprisingly the researchers found a relationship between loneliness and feelings of self-worth, but that it was significantly weaker for those people that regularly smoked pot.

Tests found that people who regularly smoked pot didn't suffer as much from feelings of social exclusion as those who didn't smoke or did so only very rarely

‘Marijuana use buffered the lonely from both negative self-worth and poor mental health,’ the researchers wrote in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal.

Another experiment found people who were experiencing social pain were less likely to have suffered a major depression in the past year if they were regular pot smokers.

A third experiment was based around the Cyberball computer game, half the participants in the three-person game received the ball twice early on, and then never again during for the remainder.

Afterwards they were asked to react to a series of statements designed to assess whether their need for self-esteem and belonging felt threatened using statements such as, 'I had the feeling that the other players did not like me.'

Smoking pot can help temporarily alleviate feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem and social awkwardness, but the real cure is learning and dealing with the underlying issues that make someone feel like that

The results found that those who frequently smoked marijuana felt less threatened than the others.

Deckman and his colleagues have concluded that these studies show 'marijuana use consistently buffered people from the negative consequences associated with loneliness and social exclusion'.

They also warned that while marijuana isn't an adequate cure to solving these problems.

'Humans have a fundamental need to belong,' the researchers noted. 'Hurt feelings motivate us to fix our relationships and re-establish social connection.'

So while smoking pot can help temporarily alleviate feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem and social awkwardness, the real cure is learning and dealing with the underlying issues that make someone feel like that.
