Polar ice sheets are now melting three times faster than they did in the 1990s, a 'definitive' study of satellite data has found.

The amount of ice lost from Greenland and Antarctica is enough to raise world sea levels by almost one millimetre a year.

Since 1992, it has added more than 1cm to global sea levels - contributing around a fifth of the total rise.

About two thirds of the ice loss was from Greenland and the remainder from Antarctica, said scientists.

Until now, there has been confusion over what is happening to the ice sheets in a warming world.

Estimates have differed greatly, with some studies even suggesting gains rather than losses.

The new survey is said to be the most accurate assessment to date, ending 20 years of uncertainty.It confirms that, with the exception of East Antarctica, both land masses are losing ice. But big differences in the pace of change were seen at each pole.

The new research concludes that 
Antarctica is melting, but points to the smaller ice sheet in Greenland,
 which covers most of the island, as the bigger and more pressing issue.
 Its melt rate has grown from about 55 billion tons a year in the 1990s 
to almost 290 billion tons a year recently, according to the study.

'Greenland is really taking off,' 
said National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Ted Scambos, a 
co-author of the paper released Thursday by the journal Science.

One of the biggest wild cards in 
climate change has been figuring out how much the melting of the massive
 sheets of ice at the two poles would add to the seas.

Study leader Professor Andrew Shepherd, from the University of Leeds, said: 'The success of this venture is due to the co-operation of the international scientific community, and due to the provision of precise satellite sensors by our space agencies.

'Without these efforts, we would not be in a position to tell people with confidence how the Earth's ice sheets have changed, and to end the uncertainty that has existed for many years.'

Scientists blame man-made global 
warming for the melting. Burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, 
emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that trap heat, warming 
the atmosphere and oceans. Bit-by-bit, that erodes the ice sheets from 
above and below. Snowfall replenishes the ice sheets, but hasn't kept 
pace with the rate of melting.

Because the world's oceans are so 
big, it takes a lot of ice melting - about 10 trillion tons - to raise 
sea levels 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). Since 1992, ice sheets at the poles
 have lost nearly 5 trillion tons of ice, the study says, raising sea 
levels by about a half inch.

That seemingly tiny extra bit 
probably worsened the flooding from an already devastating Superstorm 
Sandy last month, said NASA ice scientist Erik Ivins, another co-author 
of the study. He said the extra weight gives each wave a little more 
energy.

'The more energy there is in a wave, the further the water can get inland,' Ivins said.

Globally, the world's oceans rose about half a foot (15 centimeters) on average in the 20th Century.

Melting ice sheets accounts for about
 one-fifth of sea level rise. Warmer water expands, contributing to the 
rise along with water from melting glaciers outside the polar regions.

The scientists matched results from 10 satellite observations employing three separate techniques to spot changes on the Earth. The aim was to reconcile differences between earlier studies.

Care was taken to compare similar geographical regions, time periods, and models of ice sheet behaviour.

Rates of ice loss were calculated for Greenland, East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.

Although East Antarctica showed a net increase in ice mass, this was not enough to compensate for larger losses elsewhere.

The research is published today in the journal Science.

Commenting on the findings, Professor Richard Alley, a US climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said: 'This project is a spectacular achievement. The data will support essential testing of predictive models, and will lead to a better understanding of how sea-level change may depend on the human decisions that influence global temperatures.'

The vast polar ice sheets lock up unimaginable amounts of water. The Antarctic ice sheet contains 30 million cubic kilometres of ice and holds around 90% of all the fresh water on the surface of the Earth.

If the whole Antarctic ice sheet melted, sea levels would rise by more than 60 metres.

The Greenland ice sheet is much smaller, but would add seven metres to sea levels if it all melted away.

Just how much ice is melting at the two poles has been difficult for scientists to answer. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change did not include ice sheet melt in its calculations of future sea level rise because numbers were so uncertain.

NASA chief scientist Waleed Abdalati, one of the few top ice researchers who wasn't part of the study, praised the work.

'Understanding how and why the ice sheets are changing today better equips us for understanding and predicting how much and in what ways they will change in the future,' he said.
