Newcastle’s initial attempts to recruit emergency goalkeeper cover were flatly rejected by the Premier League — but the Tyneside club may yet return to argue their case.

They can make a representation to the Premier League board if they feel they are being unfairly treated because Karl Darlow is out on loan at Nottingham Forest with no recall clause.

Manager Alan Pardew expects Tim Krul and Rob Elliot to be ruled out with injuries until mid-January and 21-year-old rookie Jak Alnwick leaked four at Arsenal on his first senior start.

The only other keeper available to Pardew is 17-year-old Freddie Woodman, and Newcastle think they are being unfairly punished for allowing Darlow, 24, to re-join his former club Forest on loan for the season.

Newcastle are at Tottenham on Wednesday in the Capital One Cup quarter-final, followed by the Tyne-Wear derby at St James’ Park on Sunday and Pardew urged Alnwick, out of contract at the end of the season, to seize his big chance.

‘This is a guy with an opportunity to make a big name for himself,’ said Pardew.

‘And he is the sort of guy you would want to do it. He’s a good, honest guy, humble and another local.

‘I can probably look at one Arsenal goal and say Jak may have been at fault.

‘Other than that I thought he was pretty sound.’
