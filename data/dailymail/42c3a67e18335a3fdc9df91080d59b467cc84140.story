Alex Pritchard is hoping to catch the eye of Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino during his loan spell at Championship new-boys Brentford.

The England Under 21 international was handed his Tottenham debut by Tim Sherwood in May following a successful stint at Swindon Town.

However, the midfielder has been allowed to leave White Hart Lane to get regular first-team football, and Pritchard hopes his time with the Bees will boost his chances at his parent club.

He said: 'I had my first full year of men's football at Swindon so I'm looking to continue that here.

'I felt I needed to make the step back up to Championship, where I've previously played with Peterborough.

'Hopefully people will be watching and I can show them what I can do. But you've just got to concentrate on your game and the rest will take care of itself.

'I'm a Brentford player now so I'll work hard for the team and whatever happens, happens. I've settled in really well. All the lads have made me feel welcome.'

Pritchard has scored one goal in five starts since arriving at Griffin Park in the summer.
