A well-respected family of GPs who spent their lives looking after people on a remote Scottish island will be honoured with a memorial, it was revealed today.

Dr Alexander Macleod, from the Isle of Lewis, and his family spent over 70 years caring for people on North Uist in the Outer Hebrides - and at one point had delivered most of the babies on the island.

From the time Dr Macleod set up his practice in 1932 until he retired in 1974 he visited the people of North Uist on foot and on horseback. He was succeeded by his son John, who served until 2000.

Committed: Dr Alexander Macleod is pictured (left) returning from a visit to Berneray to see a patient and (right) going to Baleshare to visit another patient. He used to visit the people of North Uist on foot and on horseback

Couple: Dr Alexander Macleod with his wife Julia, who was also a GP and served many years standing in for her husband when he was visiting patients on Berneray, Baleshare or other small islands surrounding North Uist

Technique: Dr Alexander Macleod is pictured filling a syringe by gaslight in his surgery. A plaque remembering the Macleod family will be placed on a hill on North Uist in the Outer Hebrides

They have been compared to Dr Finlay - the 
doctor created by author A. J. Cronin, who looked after his Highlands 
patients from birth to death and starred in TV and radio series Dr 
Finlay's Casebook.

John 
Macleod passed away in 2009 aged 74. Now, a plaque remembering the 
Macleod family will be placed on a hill on North Uist and unveiled by Dr
John Gillies.

He 
is the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners of 
Scotland (RCGP), a native of North Uist and was also delivered by 
Alexander Macleod.

Alexander’s
wife Julia was also a GP and served many years standing in for her 
husband when he was visiting patients on Berneray, Baleshare or other 
small islands surrounding North Uist.

During Alexander’s time healthcare was so scarce on the island that he even pulled teeth.

'All the Macleods understood the true meaning of service and of supporting communities as well as individuals'

Dr John Gillies, Royal College of General Practitioners of Scotland chairman

In
a talk given at Uist and Barra Hospital in 2008 - a year before his 
death - John said: ‘In each of the islands, the surgery was part of the 
house so our dining room was also the waiting room.

‘There were only occasional visits from dentists so the GP had to do extractions.

‘There was a second door to the 
surgery and if we saw father carrying his pan of dental instruments 
though to boil them in the kitchen it became a signal for us to crouch 
behind this door and listen to the patients' reactions.

‘Once
discarded, some of the angled dental forceps were great for getting at 
car engine nuts in awkward places, as car maintenance was also part of 
the job.’

Dr Gillies said 
today: ‘Dr Alec was usually known as “an dotair mor” [the big doctor] 
because of his height and bearing, or “Zadoc” [after Zadok The Priest, of 
George Frideric Handel’s 1727 anthem].

Alexander Macleod was originally one of the doctors funded by the Highlands and Islands Medical Service established 100 years ago.

This transformed rural health provision 35 years before the establishment of the National Health Service.

Before the Medical Service there had been concern about the state of medical provision in the Highlands and Islands.

There
were reports of poultry buried as treatment for neurological 
conditions, uncertified deaths, do-it-yourself child delivery; and a 
handful of doctors and nurses to cover vast areas of the country.

When doctors did arrive they did not stay long. The island of Papa Westray in Orkney had 13 doctors between 1895 and 1914.

Eventually
there was sufficient public concern for a comprehensive inquiry into 
healthcare provision in the Highland and Islands to be announced in 
1912.

It was chaired by Sir John Dewar, Liberal MP for Inverness, and a son of the founder of Dewar’s whisky.

The
Dewar committee report led to the setting up of the Highlands and 
Islands Medical Service in 1913 with a Treasury grant of £42,000.

Doctors
would have a basic income but could continue to treat private patients.
Fees were set at minimal levels but any who could not pay were still 
treated.

A house, telephone,
car or motor boat and locum cover were provided. By 1929 there were 175
nurses, one on St Kilda, and 160 doctors in 150 practices.

Stornoway had its first surgeon in 1924, Wick in 1931, and Shetland and Orkney by 1934.

‘Dr
Alec was a man of great observational powers and stamina and cared for 
his patients 24 hours a day through a time when most had no transport, 
no telephones and no electricity, visiting on foot and sometimes on 
horseback.

‘He delivered many children born on the island and had a formidable reputation as an obstetrician.

‘He
was responsible for the first air ambulance flight to the Western Isles
in the 1930s when he arranged for an aircraft to take a patient to 
Glasgow who was too infirm to travel by land and sea home to Clachan in 
Uist.

‘That patient was my 
great uncle, Reverend Calum Gillies, and the flight is commemorated in a
memorial cairn beside the one to be unveiled to the MacLeods.

‘All the Macleods understood the true meaning of service and of supporting communities as well as individuals, something we are having to rediscover today in general practice as we try to integrate health and social care in Scotland.

‘They exemplified throughout their professional lives, the spirit of the motto of RCGP, Cum scientia caritas, or science with compassion.’

Both Alexander and John became well respected fellows of the RCGP.

The Macleod family are part of the National Museum of Scotland's exhibition ‘Scotland: A Changing Nation’ which documents the doctors' lives on North Uist.

Dr Gillies said: ‘Dr Alec brought me into the world. I have been a rural GP for most of my life and I have always thought the Macleod family were the epitome of health care. They were definitely role models for me.’

Mrs Macleod added: ‘My father-in-law would travel out to the surrounding islands on horse or by boat. The horse was not even his but the owners let him take it whenever he wanted and he would have to wait for the tide to go out before riding out.

‘Sometimes he an appointment went on longer than anticipated he would have to wait until the tide went back out so he could ride back to North Uist. Patience is a virtue when you live on an island.

‘The GPs on North Uist always considered the district nurses as a vital part of the "team". Often they were called before the doctor and especially before there were phones in the island.’
