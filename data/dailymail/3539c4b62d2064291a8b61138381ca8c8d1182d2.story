A baby boy, who was abandoned by his Australian adoptive parents, has been relocated to one of Thailand's advanced hospitals which provides advanced medical treatment for Down's Syndrome patients.

Gammy will be treated by several specialists at Samitivej Sriracha Hospital in Bangkok, Nine News reported on Sunday.

This comes after Pattharamon Janbua - the surrogate mother of the six-month-old boy - carried twins for an Australian couple, but they only took the healthy baby girl home with them.

The 21-year-old Thai woman has also vowed to care for the critically-ill baby she gave birth to, and had her hopes of a spirited survival for Gammy heightened in the days since he has been receiving treatment for a serious lung infection.

He was previously being treated at a hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand.

Staff at the new hospital said they would take care of Ms Janbua and treat her  like family.

Through a translator, Ms Janbua said she is 'very happy that everybody loves the baby (and) everybody wants to help the baby'.

Scores of Australians have offered to adopt the baby boy born with Down's Syndrome after he was suddenly abandoned by his parents when they discovered his disability.

Aided by an incredible fundraising effort for his medical costs, which now stands at more than $182,000, Ms Pattharamon said she wants to 'take care of Gammy' as her own. 'I won't give my baby to anybody,' she told Fairfax Media.

In new pictures taken on Sunday, Ms Chanbua can be seen hugging and kissing her baby boy Gammy as she and her older son Game, 7, sit in hospital with him.

The family huddle together in a brightly coloured hospital room while Gammy clutches a creme coloured teddy bear wearing what looks to be a white doctor's lab coat.

Game sits next to his mother and looks on at his little brother, who was left with his surrogate mother when his Australian adoptive parents are said to have abandoned him, only taking his healthy twin sister.

Ms Chanbua's hopes of a spirited survival for the six-month-old comes after she had all but conceded on Friday that he would die because of his illness.

Bangkok-based media outlet, the Thai Rath newspaper, reported Ms Janbua believed her son's death was unavoidable.

More than $182,000 has been raised so far for Gammy's mother to pay for her sick son's medical expenses

Ms Chanbua previously said she loved the six-month-old boy like he was her own child, and has vowed to care for her son

She has been by his bedside as he battles a lung infection, according to the Thai Rath newspaper.

'I think the baby will not make it because his lung infection is too serious,' she told a Thai Rath reporter.

The first two targets were $25,000 and $150,000 and were surpassed on Friday and Saturday. More than 4,431 people have donated in the weeks since the Hope For Gammy page went live and the new target is set at $300,000.

The page pleads: '6 month old baby Gammy was born in Bangkok with down syndrome and a congenital heart condition. He was abandoned by his family and is being cared for by a young Thai woman who does not have the funds for his desperately needed medical treatment. 

'Please make a donation so that he can have these operations and improve his quality of life. All monies raised will be kept in trust and will only be used for the care and wellbeing of Gammy.'

Ms Pattharamon said she 'did not expect' to see such a large donation of money pool in, and it has given her renewed hope after she was reduced to tears on Friday.

The woman broke down during an interview with ABC after telling of her pain for baby Gammy

The campaign by charity Hands Across The Water is still ongoing and they have vowed to donate every cent raised to looking after the little boy

The 21-year-old broke down when she spoke about how the baby she was paid to carry was was rejected by his Australian parents.

She told of her pain for the child, saying she loved the baby boy like he was her own and her suffering  has motivated her to take care of him.

The young mother - who lives 90km south of Bangkok - had been paid a total of about $16,000 by the couple to give birth to the baby but when she gave birth to twins - a boy and a girl - they only took the girl back to Australia.

Ms Janbua - who already had two other children aged three and six - told the ABC she felt sorry for baby Gammy.

'This was the adults’ fault. And who is he to endure something like this even though it’s not his fault?' she said.

'Why does he have to be abandoned and the other baby has it easy?

'I chose to have him, not to hurt him.'

Ms Janbua said she treated the six-month-old like he was one of her own children.

'I love him, he was in my tummy for nine months, it’s like my child,' she told the ABC.

'Never think that you’re not my child, that I don’t care for you.'

This came after an online campaign set up for Gammy raised more than $50,000 after his heartbreaking story was shared.

The couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Chanbua to have an abortion when they found out four-months into the pregnancy that one of the babies had Down syndrome.

The Australian couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Chanbua to have an abortion

'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Janbua said, The Sydney Morning Herald reported earlier on Friday.

The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Janbua was having twins for them. Ms Chanbua is a Buddhist and thinks abortion is a 'sin'.

She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency.

The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves.

Ms Chabua, from a village in Chon Buri province in southern Thailand, gave birth to Gammy and his twin sister in Bangok hospital.

'Because of the poverty and debts, the money that was offered was a lot for me,' she told the ABC.

'In my mind, with that money, we one could educate my children and two we can repay our debt.'

However, when the babies were born the agent took the girl away and delivered her to the Australian couple who Ms Chanbua has never met.

She never received the remaining $2341 that she was owed by the agent and is now struggling to keep her baby alive.

One doctor has donated $3,000 to the cause.

An administrator for the page wrote: 'Dr Pisit of ALL IVF has made a very generous donation after hearing about the Gammy Story. No ALL IVF Center staff have ever been involved in the Gammy case, but are touched by his situation and wanted to help. Thank you very much.'

Gammy's tragic story has caused outrage on Twitter.

Richard Long wrote: 'Takes a bit to make me angry but this story does. what greedy, selfish people.'

Another user, @ChickkinOz, said 'these people need to be financially responsible for this child and woman for life. Unbelievable, how are they parents.'

While @BCmanutddesi called it 'OUTRAGEOUS!!

'This story just makes my blood boil!!,' @parentingfiles said. 

Australians are not the only people that travel to Thailand for surrogacy reasons.

Earlier his year, there were 65 babies stuck in Thailand that were conceived by gay Israeli couples and birthed by surrogate Thai women, the Times of Israel said.

The claims were made by the Facebook group 'Help Us Bring the Babies Home'.

The babies were allegedly unable to be brought to Israel because the Interior Ministry Gideon Sa'ar has not granted Israeli citizenship to the infants.

Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex.

Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled:

Many Australians have flocked to Thailand over the years because the rules were far less strict. However, the rules have changed this week.

After Thailand’s military government reviewed 12 Thai IVF clinics involved in surrogacy cases they have announced new laws.  

Surrogacy is now only recognised in Thailand if:

Surrogacy in Thailand is illegal if:

These new laws will now exclude almost every Australian from pursuing surrogacy in Thailand.
