Carl Ashby has spent eight months with an open wound in his ankle and fears he could lose his foot

A man has spent eight years with an open wound in his ankle and fears he could lose his foot - after doctors refused to remove a loose screw they put there.

Carl Ashby is in constant pain after the screw, one of three put in his ankle to correct a club foot when he was a child, came loose and caused the gaping hole in his ankle.

Now the 48-year-old security guard fears he will lose his foot after doctors told him they could not remove the inch-long metal screw floating around in his damaged ankle because 'there’s nothing more they can do'.

Mr Ashby, from north London, said: 'I’ve had this loose screw floating around my ankle for eight years and doctors keep telling me that there’s nothing more they can do.

'Why can’t they remove it? The last time the hole opened up in my ankle was more than two years ago, and it just isn’t closing up.

'Every step I take is like walking on hot coals.

'I’m struggling to do my job, which is a terrible shame because I don’t want to let this ruin my life.

'I’m worried the doctors will be left with no choice but to amputate it if anything worse happens. It’s an open wound - what if infection sets in?'

Mr Ashby, who was born with two club feet, had successful operations to correct his twisted ankles when he was six and eight.

But in 2006, after a pain-free life, his right ankle began throbbing.

Eventually, one of the scars in his ankle opened up, revealing a gaping hole underneath.

Carl said: 'I went to the doctors who told me that the wound would heal all on its own.

'That took ages to heal, but eventually it did. Then another hole opened up in the same place, and again it healed.

'This time it opened up in 2012, and hasn’t closed since. It’s horrible to look at - makes people feel sick.'

He is now growing increasingly frustrated because despite a series of X-rays, ultrasounds and appointments, he is yet to find a solution.

He said: 'I feel I am not being taken seriously. I am in excruciating agony and the uncertainty of it is emotionally draining. My skin has been completely eaten away.

'I fear I will end up losing my foot. I heard a story about a woman who died - and it was later found she’d had a metal pin in her foot like mine which had become infected.

Mr Ashby is referring to the case of Carole Denby, 63, who killed herself after claiming doctors had left a piece of metal in her ankle.

He was revealed to have been right all along after a titanium screw was found in her ashes.

Mrs Denby was so depressed that doctors wouldn't take her claims seriously that she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

'I told one of my doctors I wanted it operated on and in a letter he said there was nothing more he could do for me.

'I was shocked and incredibly upset. I just don’t know how I can be left like this.'

He added: “I feel people are getting fed up with me complaining all the time. My mental state is suffering and I feel depressed and unsure of my future.

'I’ve seen so many doctors - the only ward I’ve not visited is maternity. I understand the NHS is struggling, but there have to be limits.

'There must be so many others - people who don’t have a voice - in my situation or worse off. Something has got to be done for all of us.

'I feel like I’ve seriously dropped through the system.
