London Heathrow has made its first appearance in the rankings of Best Airports in the World 2013 as voted by for thousands of European travellers .

The study, released by online travel agency eDreams, shows the UK’s biggest airport ranking fourth for its bars and restaurants worldwide, eighth for its shopping selection, and tenth in the world for its waiting lounges.

The study backs up the airport’s growing popularity as a global competitor: Heathrow was tenth overall in the prestigious World Airport Awards for 2013 recently, the second time it managed to get a place in the Top Ten.

Heathrow was named the best airport shopping award, while Terminal 5 was named best terminal building and the Sofitel London Heathrow was the sixth best airport hotel in the last World Airport Awards.

Heathrow's Terminal 5 is currently home to an 11,000-square-foot Harrods and a gallery exhibiting sculptures from emerging British artists, and the airport will be given even more of a chance to further improve its position as force to be reckoned with this year.

The Queen’s Terminal 2 will open on June 4, with 52 shops and 17 restaurants, including the much anticipated Perfectionists Cafe from award-winning chef Heston Blumenthal .

But the eDreams’ global report, compiled from thousands of customer reviews gathered over the last year, shows that the majority of travellers still prefer the services and installations of the Asian airports above those offered by the European ones.

Singapore's Changi Airport maintains its number two position in the ranking for the second year running, while Tokyo's Narita International Airport secures first place in 2013, a jump from its fourth place position in the 2012 eDreams survey.

The company's third annual study shows that European airports have fared slightly better in the overall rankings of the 2013 survey, with five European airports making it into the top 10 best airports in 2013, compared to four in 2012.

The highest rated European airport is Germany's Hamburg Airport in fourth place. Mauricio Prieto of eDreams, says, "Such valuable feedback can only come from the travellers experiencing these airports for themselves."

As for the airports with the lowest overall ratings, eDreams customers deemed two of Paris's airports, Paris Orly Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport, the two worst in the world.
