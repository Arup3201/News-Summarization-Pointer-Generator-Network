Banks could be ordered to stop using premium rate numbers for customer helplines. 

Customers looking for help or to report a problem can be charged up to 41p a minute from a mobile when calling 0845 customer service lines. 

However, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is to launch an investigation into banks using the premium rates.

Banks could be told they must stop using premium rate numbers for customer helplines

Last year airlines, train operators, high street stores and web retailers were ordered to stop using premium rate numbers for customer helplines. 

Banks and finance companies were exempt from the new controls as well as government departments which earned £56million from premium rate numbers in 2012 alone.

The measure will be brought into force in June 2014.

Now there will could be a crackdown on banks as well as insurance companies and credit card firms. 

Three-quarters of customer service and complaint helplines charge a premium rate. 

RBS and Barclays were the first banks to drop the charges six months ago. However, HSBC and Lloyds still use them.

HSBC is just one bank which has not yet dropped using premium rate charges

The campaigning consumer group Which? launched a campaign earlier this year to try to get firms to drop expensive premium-rate numbers for customer helplines.

A spokeswoman said: 'We're pleased the FCA agrees customers shouldn't have to pay a premium to talk to their bank or insurer.

'Changing the rules so financial firms can only offer basic rate helplines would be a big win for the 87,000 people who supported our campaign.

'Some of the biggest banks have already dropped costly calls so there is no reason why others shouldn't follow their lead.

Crackdown: Three-quarters of customer service and complaint helplines charge a premium rate

'We'd like to see all financial services firms change to basic rate lines as soon as possible, and not wait until new rules come into effect.'

According to The Sun, the FCA's Director of Policy Christopher Woolard, said: 'Our consultation will propose the standardisation of the rules so that charges for consumer help and complaint lines are capped at the cost of a basic rate call.' 

Last year it emerged that Air France, Aer Lingus, Ryanair, National Express and Eurolines were using such numbers for those requesting travel assistance because they were disabled or elderly.
