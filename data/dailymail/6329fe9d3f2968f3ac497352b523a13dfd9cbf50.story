Sportsmail's Martin Keown reflects on England's 3-1 victory over Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring for Roy Hodgson's side before captain Wayne Rooney struck twice in the second half to seal victory over their closest rivals.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came in well off the touchline for his goal but his all-round game was not good enough.

He didn’t work hard enough off the ball and England cannot afford to carry anyone defensively. When Scotland had the ball, Oxlade-Chamberlain too often went into rest mode and Andrew Robertson stole a march on him too many times down the flank.

He is always a threat going forward but he needs to get into a defensive position much quicker and learn to cut out the ball down the line.

Wilshere was often caught out of position defensively at Celtic Park

He was guilty of not doing that for Arsenal against Swansea recently too and that left Calum Chambers far too exposed at right back.

Oxlade-Chamberlain took his goal very well but there are still areas of his game that need improving.

England need to get Jack Wilshere on the ball more.

He’s our playmaker and is supremely talented and England weren’t looking for him enough against Scotland. When they did finally get him on the ball, we saw with the goal just what he is capable of.

But Wilshere is partly to blame too. He was sometimes standing in positions where he couldn’t receive the ball that easily from his team-mates.

He needs to work harder to find the space so the rest of the team can get him on the ball in dangerous positions.

Wilshere produced a superb assist for England's opening goal and was a creative threat

The attitude of England’s players impressed me.

They did not seem to have an eye on protecting themselves ahead of the return of the Premier League, they were fully committed.

Danny Welbeck put in plenty of tasty challenges and Wayne Rooney and Luke Shaw in particular looked well up for the game.

This fixture might be a friendly by name but it clearly mattered more than that to Roy Hodgson’s men. It was good to see them showing some strong fighting spirit.
