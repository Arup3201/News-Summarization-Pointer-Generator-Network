Well this is awkward. The Prime Minister makes a lot of his special relationship with Barack Obama - but it seems the President who calls him 'bro' doesn't feel the same way.

Mr Obama is following the wrong David Cameron on Twitter - a computer game-lover from Oregon who tweets about Back to the Future and Star Trek.

While @DavidCameron enjoys the attention of the U.S. premier, British counterpart @David_Cameron has been left high and dry by the most powerful man in the world.

One-way relationship: David Cameron faithfully follows his U.S. counterpart on Twitter - but Barack Obama has not returned the favour, despite following 645,000 people. Instead he follows an Oregon movie fan

Spot the difference: Prime Minister David Cameron... and a computer game-lover from Oregon in the U.S.

The unequal relationship was revealed with the help of online tool DoesFollow, which analyses who follows who on the social networking site.

The Prime Minister follows just 382 carefully-picked people, and the U.S. President is among them.

But Mr Obama does not follow him back, despite being signed up for the updates of 645,000 people.

Instead he follows @DavidCameron, an internet user from Oregon who wrote when the Prime Minister joined Twitter in 2012: 'I am NOT the prime minister.

'I am a dude from America, who is more awesome than the prime minister.'

He has 1,143 followers compared to the PM's 897,000 - though they do include Stephen Fry.

To any careful eye it'd be obvious that he isn't one of the leaders of the free world.

His tweets include: 'Any Oregon area friends who might be available tomorrow to help unload a moving van into a storage unit?'

Awkward: @BarackObama follows Oregon computer game-lover @davidcameron - but not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom @David_Cameron. The Prime Minister does, however, return the favour

Another declared: 'Uhg. Someone cook me foooood.'

On January 8, he wrote: 'I HAVE TWO F****** GLASSES OF WINE AND SUDDENLY I HAVE A CASE OF THE HICCUPS THAT IS SO BAD I WILL PROBABLY PULL A MUSCLE.'

And on December 21, his message to the world was: 'Just cried while watching Muppet Christmas Carol.'

The closest he has ever come to enacting a new law has been to suggest 'banning the practice of packing books into cardboard boxes' while he was moving house.

That's all without mentioning his profile picture is a still from Back to the Future Part II.

The President is not the only Twitter user who has mistaken Oregon's David Cameron for the real thing - he receives a daily tide of abuse from people unhappy about government policy.

Definitely not Britain's David Cameron: The Oregon tweeter's updates are decidedly un-Prime Ministerial

Sometimes he replies, telling one person who said 'please shut up @davidcameron': 'Nope'.

He gave the same response to another user who wrote: 'Can @davidcameron confirm whether 24hrs in A&E is a Channel 4 documentary or Government policy?'

There is a simple explanation for the social media faux pas first spotted by thenextweb.com.

The U.S. President no longer runs his own Twitter account. Despite having Twitter's blue 'certified' tick, it is run by campaigners for the Organizing for Action group.

And instead of following other users manually, like the Prime Minister does, it 'auto-follows' people who have decided to follow the President.

Not everyone is auto-followed, and the account goes through long periods without following people back.

But that didn't stop the news prompting amusement on Twitter. One American user wrote of Obama: 'Can't he do anything right?'
