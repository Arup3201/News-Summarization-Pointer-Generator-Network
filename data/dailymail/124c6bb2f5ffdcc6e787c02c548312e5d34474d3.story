The amazing story of how a struggling army recruit emerged to play a key role in tracking down Saddam Hussein reads like a Hollywood movie script, and that’s exactly what Eric Maddox’s life story is soon to become.

As a military interrogator in the Iraqi backwater of Tikrit, Maddox was forced to develop his own methods of getting information from the locals after the techniques he’d learned in the army failed miserably.

But by going against what the military had taught him, Maddox secured the ultimate success and got the information that led U.S. troops to capture Hussein in December 2003.

The story of how struggling army recruit Eric Maddox from Oklamhoma emerged as a key player in tracking down Saddam Hussein reads like a Hollywood movie script

It was all a very long way from Maddox’s inauspicious starts as a struggling new recruit some ten years before.

After graduating from the University of Oklahoma in 1994, Maddox claims that a voice from God told him to become an army Airborne Ranger, even though he'd never shot a gun and was terrified of heights.

‘Every day of Ranger School, I was like, “are you sure?” - I barely passed,’ Maddox recently recalled to News9.

Next he decided to become an army interrogator after someone convinced him that it would be an easy ride. 

In Mission: Blacklist, due out next year, Robert Pattinson will play Eric Maddox in the improbable story of how he tracked down Saddam Hussein in 2003

Maddox said, ‘They told me, “Be an interrogator. That's the easiest one. It's eight weeks of training. You'll never have to do it. We don't have any prisoners".'

But then came the events of September 11, 2001 and everything changed. U.S. forces invaded Iraq in March 2003 and Maddox was sent to Tikrit, Hussein's hometown, to interrogate prisoners who were captured on raids by Special Forces teams.

Maddox admits he failed miserably when he first started.

He said: 'The really scary part was when I realized not only had I not done an interrogation but, when I started doing them, they didn't work.'

Fortunately, Tikrit was considered a backwater and so he was left to develop his own technique.

'It was the best thing that happened to me because there were no expectations,' Maddox said. 'I could figure out how to get the prisoners to talk without torturing them.'

Maddox soon discovered that he his technique also worked. He had a natural ability for taking tiny bits of information from hundreds of prisoners and being able to piece it together to reveal the bigger picture.

He said: 'I went to the team leader and made a pitch - "I know this sounds crazy, but I think I have a path that, if we follow, might possibly lead us to Black List No.1 [Saddam]".'

Rather than focusing on high-profile targets, Maddox spoke with bodyguards, chauffeurs and shopkeepers and slowly more of the bigger picture emerged.

Then just as he was due to leave for Doha, Qatar, Maddox finally came face-to-face with his No.1 target - a personal bodyguard of Saddam.

With only two hours to convince the bodyguard to talk before he had to leave for the airport, Maddox told him to 'beat on his cell' if he decided to change his mind and talk.

The scene where U.S. troops captured ousted Iraqi President Hussein in December 2003, it was vital information found out by Maddox that lead to Saddam's capture

He said: 'As I'm driving to the airplane to leave the country, they told me, "That prisoner. What did you do? He's going crazy, beating the heck out of his cell in there".'

Maddox got the prisoner to sketch a map detailing Saddam's location, which lead to his historic capture.

Maddox said: 'It took me several years to come to the conclusion I wasn't going to wake up from a dream.'

He now lives in Houston and continues to work for the Department of Defense.

A couple of years ago he wrote a book that a movie studio immediately bought the rights to.

Mission: Blacklist is currently in pre-production, with Robert Pattinson set to play Maddox. It is expected to be released next year.
