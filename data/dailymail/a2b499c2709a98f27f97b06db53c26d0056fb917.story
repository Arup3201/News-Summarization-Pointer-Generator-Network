The only lifeline one tiny, isolated Alaskan island has to the rest of the world is cut off, leaving snowed-in residents deprived of any food, mail or deliveries of any kind.

The single helicopter that normally supplies Little Diomede Island, population around 100, has been out of commission for servicing for three weeks.

Even the hardy native hunters who populate the tiny speck of land 2.4 miles from Russia are having trouble bringing home game because of nasty weather conditions.

And that leaves residents scrambling to meet basic needs as the winter wears on.

Getting hungry: Nasty conditions and a broken down helicopter have left the 170 or so residents of isolated Little Diomede Island in Alaska with their cupboards running bare

'In our store, it's pretty bare. We do have a bunch of food here at the school, which will last for a while,'  Andrea Okbealuk, who works at the school on Little Diomede, told the Anchorage Dispatch News.

On Tuesday, hungry community members ate alongside schoolchildren at the Diomede School. 

The last flight of the Boeing Bölkow BO-105 helicopter to Diomede arrived in January.

Since then, cupboard, mailboxes and even baby models have steadily emptied.

'It is hard when there's no milk...When you've switched your baby to regular canned milk to whole milk, to nonfat milk, to two percent milk, and then to nonfat milk again, and then now to powdered milk, it upsets the baby's stomach,' said Okbealuk. 'A couple of us are going to that now.'

While the helicopter that residents are accustomed to has not touched down in weeks, the people of Little Diomede have since gotten airborne visitors. 

Isolated: The tiny village perched at the edge of what is basically a mountain jetting out of the Bering Sea rely on routine visits from a helicopter paid for by federal dollars and an area non-profit for food, supplies and mail

This past weekend, an Army National Guard Blackhawk had to medivac a pregnant 18-year-old girl out to a hospital in Nome.

While they were there, the crew learned of a critically ill 2-year-old child. That child was also flown out for treatment.

Chris Schuldt, program director at the helicopter operator Erikson Aviation, told the ADN the helicopter will be back to flying its regular route very soon.

'We've had some maintenance on the aircraft, but the goal is to return it to service in the next one to two days,' he said Tuesday. 'Pending weather, [the helicopter] will return to Nome and begin operations as soon as that's complete, [and] make sure our aircraft are in the top condition before we begin flying passengers and cargo again.'
