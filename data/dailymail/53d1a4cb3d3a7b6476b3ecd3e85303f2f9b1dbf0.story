Despite ample warnings, more and more Australians are looking for love in the wrong places and falling victim to online romance scams.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says that total losses for dating and romance scams reached an eye-popping $23 million this year.

In a bid to protect the public, the ACCC has sent almost 1500 letters to potential victims in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory as part of its Scam Disruption Project.

ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard told Daily Mail Australia that the initiative, which was launched in August, has been very effective so far.

‘In the past we have relied upon getting the message out through the media, but too many people were still falling for the scams,’ she said.

‘Since we began writing to suspected scam victims, we've seen a 60 per cent drop in the victims continuing to send money.’

‘These are very ruinous plots. They destroy people emotionally and financially, so it’s very important we reduce the rates.’ 

One of the most shocking stories of online romance scams is that of Jette Jacobs, from Wagin, West Australia.

The 67-year-old widow was found dead in suspicious circumstances after she travelled to Johannesburg to meet a Nigerian man she met online.

Her body was found in a rented South African villa but her money, credit cards, jewellery, and other personal items were gone.

Ms Jacobs, who had been advised against the trip by her family and friends, had already sent over $78,000 to her Nigerian lover, who called himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh.

‘The majority of people who fall victims to the scam are middle-aged, with an even split between the genders,’ Ms Rickard said.

‘There has been an increase in the sophistication of the scams, and we’re seeing now is an influx of scams being executed through online dating sites and social media.’

She said the use of social media allows scam artist to research their victims and assume mutual interests, gaining their trust more rapidly and effectively than they had previously been able to.

‘Typically, scammers will claim they are Australians living overseas. They will profess their love and try to move the communications off the site, so they can’t be held accountable.’

Scammers will sometimes spend years building trust before they ask for money.

They often ask for money to visit the victim in Australia, but the plan to visit wall will fall through last minute.

Though it is extremely rare for the victims to recover the money, one woman from Perth known as Jenny became one of the exceptions when, back in April she regained $100,000 or about 40 per cent of the money she transferred overseas, according to the ABC.

‘Jenny was one in a million. She was ferocious in pursuing the money and was fortunate in that the bank involved in the transfer was compliant. She is one in only two other victims I have  heard of being successful, said Ms Rickard.

It is extremely rare for the victims to recover the money lost in these scams, however one woman from Perth known as Jenny (R), pictured here with Australian detective Dom Blackshaw, and Nigerian detective Paul Okoli, managed to uncover about 40 per cent of the funds she sent overseas.

Ms Rickard says there are usually some warning signs of a scam. 

‘If they do provide images, try look at some of the databases online, as there are favourite images used by scammers that can be easily identified.’

‘They also use scripts of dialogue with multiple victims at once, so try googling what they say to see if you get any hits,’ she said.

‘Once they start asking for money, that's a tell-tale sign. ’

‘If you do think you have been scammed, let Scamwatch know as soon as possible, as well as the any sites that were involved in the process.’
