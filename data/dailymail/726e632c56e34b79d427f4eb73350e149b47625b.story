A 'jealous and controlling' teenager strangled his young girlfriend and killed their unborn child because he thought she was talking to other boys, a court heard today. 

Aston Robinson, 18, repeatedly punched girlfriend Kayleigh-Anne Palmer, 16, before strangling her with her tartan scarf so she would 'be quiet', a jury was told.

Bristol Crown Court heard that Robinson lashed out at the schoolgirl - who was 24 weeks pregnant - after getting into an argument about boys she had spoken to.

While Kayleigh lay dying, he fled the scene before calmly heading to a bookies to check the status of a £20 bet.

The lifeless mother-to-be was rushed to hospital where she was placed on a ventilator and her unborn daughter died a day later.

She tragically passed away three days after the incident.

Robinson handed himself into police and confessed to killing his girfriend, but denied her murder.

He later wrote a letter to Kayleigh's mother, Helen Bage, from prison where he insisted he had not meant to kill the 16-year-old.

Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, said: 'He said, "I'm so sorry for your loss. I didn't want that to happen. I was hoping that when she woke up, and after my jail sentence, I would go back to her arms.

'"God took her way in peace, away from my accusations and my controlling behaviour."'

Mr Quinlan added: 'But God didn't take Kayleigh away, this jealous and controlling young man murdered her.

'His senseless act of violence also destroyed the life on an unborn child.

'He said he used her own scarf and did it because he was jealous and wanted her to "be quiet".'

Robinson denies murdering Kayleigh, who died on April 5 this year, and the destruction of their unborn baby, on April 3.

The court was told that Kayleigh had reported her boyfriend to the police on a number of occasions in the past after he had punched and kicked her.

On one occasion Kayleigh went to hospital with a bloody nose after he punched her hard in the face.

The court heard that when the schoolgirl, from Cheltenham, told Robinson she was pregnant he reacted badly, pushing her to the ground before shouting at her, 'this will stop you having a baby'.

Just days later police were called after a distressed Kayleigh told a stranger that she had been punched in the face following another argument with her boyfriend of six months, the court heard.

She was taken to accident and emergency where staff reported the abuse.

Mr Quinlan said: 'He suffered with paranoia where she was concerned.

'He was jealous and became jealous when he even thought that she was, or might, have lied to him.

'She said he had become jealous and accused her of looking at another boy so he punched her to the face causing the injuries.

'These episodes of violence, hostility towards the fact she was pregnant, and his jealousy manifested itself in accusations that she was seeing other boys.

'Their relationship was punctuated by his inability just to let her be.'

He later wrote a letter to Kayleigh's mother, Helen Bage (right), from prison where he insisted he had not meant to kill the 16-year-old (left)

The day before her death, Robinson sent Kayleigh a text message in which he told her, 'Make sure my name is not on your s****y kid's birth certificate'.

The message was swiftly followed by another, to her mother, which read, 'Make sure you tell Kayleigh I'm having nothing to do with her or the baby'.

Robinson, also from Cheltenham, then turned up to Kayleigh's house where the pair rowed once more before he left.

The following day Kayleigh got ready for school, kissed her mum goodbye and left for Robinson's house.

Another argument developed there over boys Kayleigh had been talking to, and when she said 'how would you like it if I had met some boys?' Robinson lashed out.

During an interview with police he told officers he grabbed her red tartan scarf from the table and wrapped it around Kayleigh's throat, pulling it tight at both ends.

He said she offered no resistance and did not struggle, and he dragged her from the sofa to the floor.

When she stopped moving he rolled her over and, after discovering she was blue, immediately bolted from the property at 11.45am.

He ran into his sister, Michaela, who discovered Kayleigh lying face down on the living room floor and attempted to resuscitate her.

Robinson later handed himself in at Cheltenham police station.

The case continues.
