Coroner Mrs Anne Hind was told at the Blackpool hearing that Nicola's cries for help could be heard but it was too dark to see her

Hours after arriving on a Caribbean island, a mother of two drowned on the beach when she became trapped in quicksand while watching the sun set.

Nicola Raybone, 33, had flown out to Antigua with her son and daughter to attend her father's second marriage at a five-star resort.

She met friends at one of the bars and they enjoyed a drink and a chat together.

When the rest of the party left for dinner, she decided to stay behind to watch the beautiful sunset from the beach.

As she walked out towards the sea near the Jolly Beach Resort she became stuck in sinking sands, an inquest was told.

With the sky darkening and the waves beginning to lap around her, she began to scream for help and police were called.

The inquest in Blackpool was told her terrified cries could be heard but in the failing light no one could see where she was stuck.

Miss Raybone's sandals and mobile phone were discovered in the bar area of the hotel and a frantic hunt was launched by family, friends and hotel staff.

Eventually her body was found close to the shoreline near the £300-a-night hotel in the resort on the western coast of the island. There are no warnings on the beach although other visitors  have reported problems with quicksand.

Miss Raybone, her daughter Amy, 11, and son Dylan, 13, had been due to attend her father Kevin's beachside wedding ceremony the next day. Her uncle David Barlow said: 'She was a good swimmer  and none of this makes any  sense.

She was there with her friend Becky and her kids to  celebrate her father's wedding. Nicola was the most pleasant girl I've ever met. She loved her  kids unconditionally and never once have I heard her raise her voice to anyone.'

Tragedy: The mother of two was involved in helping many charities

Miss Raybone, a trained nursery nurse who had also studied criminology, had just moved into a new house in Lytham St Anne's with her partner John before travelling to Antigua in January.

Recording an accident verdict, coroner Anne Hind said: 'You can imagine how frightened she was. Having arrived on holiday everyone was happy about the forthcoming marriage.

'She just took a stroll along the beach and got into difficulties in very deep sand – quicksand. It is frightening how quickly it all happened.

'Her family went to look for her but it was going dark. It was easy to sink deep into the sand. The beach sloped and it became pitch black. The tide that night was very rough and high.'

Paradise isle: Just hours after landing in Antigua she became trapped just before celebrating her father's nuptials

In a joint statement read out at the inquest, Miss Raybone's relatives said: 'She loved her family so much and was so proud of her children. She was so happy when they were chosen as mascots for Blackpool FC in January 2010.

'She was involved in many charities and never one to speak ill of others. She had just moved into a new house with her partner. They were looking forward to the future together. Everyone is shocked and devastated.'
