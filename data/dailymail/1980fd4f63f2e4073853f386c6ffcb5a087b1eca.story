Roger Federer has wasted no time in getting straight back into action after his Wimbledon final defeat by Novak Djokovic.

The Swiss star took to the court once again - but with a slightly different opponent and in contrasting conditions.

US Skiing icon Lindsey Vonn challenged Federer to a tennis match in the Swiss Alps to launch chocolate-maker Lindt's new Swiss Chocolate Heaven - a new shop sitting a huge 3,454 metres above sea level.

Although it was Federer's game, it took place in Vonn's arena, with the court on the top of the Aletsch Glacier just below the Sphinx summit in Jungfraujoch.The battle between the two was set in motion last October, after Vonn had asked the seven-times Wimbledon champion on Twitter if she could play tennis with him, while offering to ski with him in return.

The match-up between the two was initially delayed after Vonn was ruled out of the Sochi Winter Olympics earlier this year with a knee injury.

However, just days after his enthralling five-set loss to Djokovic at W6, the Swiss eventually scheduled the meet-up with Vonn over Skype.

On Wednesday the two finally went to battle on the Swiss Alps with media representatives and members of Lindt all in attendance, as the two enjoyed a rally or two in the beautiful surroundings.
