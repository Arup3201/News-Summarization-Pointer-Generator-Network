The Tower of London will feature dramatic art instillation during the summer where poppies will flow Rapunzel-like from its walls filling its moat to commemorate the outbreak of the First World War.  

More than 800,000 ceramic poppies to commemorate each of the allied victims of the First World War.

More than 8,000 volunteers from across the UK will plant the poppies from August 5 to Armistice Day on November 11. 

The poppies are being sold by an independent organisation but members of the public can register through the Historic Royal Palaces website.

The poppies will cost £25 plus postage and packaging with the proceeds going to six service charities, including the Royal British Legion. It is expected that the display should earn raise millions for the charities involved.

Between August 5 and November 11, 180 names of servicemen killed during World War One will be read out at twilight before a lone bugler plays the Last Post. 

Relatives can nominate their ancestor on Twitter by contacting the Historic Royal Palaces on this link and they can discuss the commemoration on Twitter using this hashtag #TOWERPOPPIES. Names on the list are added on a first-come first-served basis.

Also, the Royal British Legion are sending out free poppy seeds to every school in the country to raise awareness of the centenary of the conflict's outbreak.
