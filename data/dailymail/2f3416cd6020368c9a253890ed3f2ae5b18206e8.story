The last time Ingeborg Oswald saw her son alive, she was urging him to carefully prepare for his quest into the Amazon to experiment with an organic hallucinogen.

He left California and died in the middle of the jungle in Peru and Oswald isn't even sure the body she brought back is him.

Two years later, she's trying to move beyond his death and stop hating the Jose Pineda Vargas, the shaman that her son had entrusted his life to and who covered up his death when things went wrong.

Lost: Kyle Nolan (right), 18, felt like his was falling behind his triplet sister and brother and went to the Peruvian Amazon to experiment with ayahuasca to see if it would help him discover himself

18-year-old Kyle Nolan was trying to make sense of his life in 2012 after having dropped out of junior college and moving back into his childhood home.

Being one of a set of triplets, Kyle felt he was falling behind his brother and sister and that he needed to find himself.

He stumbled upon the documentary Stepping Into the Fire about an ex-Marine who manages to shed the trappings of wealth after taking ayahuasca and decided to seek out the drug.

'I really tried to discourage him,' Oswald tells CNN, reflecting back on her son's interest in the hallucinogen. 'I kept telling him over and over, there are no easy answers in life.'

But Kyle had become fixated on ayahuasca, and traveled to the jungles of Madre de Dios to meet Master Mancoluto, Pineda's shaman persona.

Though it's known Kyle started the ayahuasca regimen, at some point in his journey to find himself, he was lost.

Shaman: Jose Pineda Vargas, pictured here in the trailer for Stepping Into the Fire, was convicted of culpable homicide and concealment after covering up the death of Nolan

Mother: Ingeborg Oswald, Nolan's mother, became worried when he didn't return on his flight from Peru and traveled to Madre de Dios

He missed his return flight home, and when Oswald called the center, she was told he 'just decided he wanted to leave, he took off down the road, and he's left.'

Oswald and Kyle's sister Marion traveled down to Peru to attempt to track him down, speaking to taxi drivers and locals, but finding that 'No one ever saw him.'

They returned to Northern California, only to find out later that Pineda admitted to lying to police about what happened to Kyle. 

Preparation: Taking ayahuasca, pictured in this file photo, requires the subject to undergo intense preparation and body cleansing, which Nolan followed before traveling into the Amazon 

Guidance: Americans traveling to the Amazon to try ayahuasca rely on the traditional healers or shamans to guide them, though the high demand leads to little oversight of a booming industry

In fact, the boy had been 'found him dead outside, under a bush' and Pineda 'panicked and covered him up, and told everyone that he wasn't feeling well, that he was in his cabin.'

Instead of revealing Kyle's death to his mother and to authorities, the shaman and two other men threw his body into a wheelbarrow, carted him down the road and buried him in a pit before they burned his belongings.

The Peruvian shaman was eventually convicted of culpable homicide and concealment and sentenced to five years in prison. Two others were also charged.

Closure never really came for Oswald. She returned to Peru to identify her son's body, but there the autopsy came back inconclusive.

The body was brought home and another test performed, but this also did not provide a definitive answer about whether the body belonged to her son. 

The family finally cremated the body, now Oswald says she's trying to move on, though she finds herself struggling to forgive Pineda.

'I just have to try to get this behind me. I can't continue to hate the shaman,' she said. 'I can't let him ruin my life any more than he already has. I need to get beyond it.'

As for the American tourists who head to Peru to partake in the hallucinogen that left her son dying under mysterious circumstances, Oswald says there needs to be caution, even regulation of the drug.

'If you're going to do this, you really really really need to research it and make sure wherever you find is properly supervised and there's medical supervision there,' she says.

'They call it a medicine, but it is a hallucinogenic drug. Obviously there's side effects to everything. Anyone can have an adverse reaction to something. You don't leave someone alone with a hallucinogenic drug.'
