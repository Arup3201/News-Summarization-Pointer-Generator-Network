German chancellor Angela Merkel raised eyebrows when she was pictured alongside children with blacked-up faces on the steps of the chancellery in Berlin earlier today.

Fortunately for the CDU leader, the visiting children were not part of a political stunt but carol singers dressed up as the three wise men for the German Twelfth night, known as Three Kings' Day.

As Ms Merkel joined in the charity carolling, news came that her coalition partners, the Free Democrat Party, are struggling to stay in parliament.

The Chancellor’s Christian Democrats are riding high in national polls at about 40 per cent, but as her partners in power, the Free Democrat Party (FDP), meet in Stuttgart this weekend their future looks bleak.

Current polls indicate that the FDP would fall short of the 5 per cent threshold to enter parliament, meaning Merkel would be forced to seek a coalition with the Social Democratic or Green Parties in order to secure a third term in government.

The FDP’s support has fallen from a record 14.6 per cent in the 2009 election to four per cent in a recent poll.

Although the costumes of the children
 may appear controversial, the blacked-up faces of the children joining the Chancellor today is part 
of the Sternsinger, or star singer, tradition of Dreikönigstag, the 
Three Kings' Day, when children go from house to house in groups of 
four and sing carols for charity.

It is tradition that one of the kings are black and it is not seen as racist, but part of the traditional costume.

This is a predominantly Catholic 
practice where three children dress up as the wise men who visited baby 
Jesus and one child carries a star on a stick for the three wise men to 
follow.

The three kings and
 their star ‘bless’ houses with magi as their raise money for an annual 
good cause. This year’s cause in Germany is Tanzanian hospitals.

Three
 Kings' Day is celebrated in the 6th of January which is a public 
holiday in three German states, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria and 
Saxony-Anhalt, and marks the end of the Christmas celebrations.
