Children hoping to wake up to a magical blanket of snow today will be sorely disappointed.

Not only can we kiss goodbye to dreams of a White Christmas this year, it’s not even going to feel that cold.

Forecasters say that temperatures over the coming days may be some of the warmest for the time of year in more than a decade – milder than Athens and Barcelona.

Temperatures of around 10C to 13C are expected across the country, with some parts of the UK reaching up to 14C.

Winter warmer: Temperatures this month could approach the warmest for this time of year in a decade, according to forecasters

It leaves temperatures close to the warmest Christmas Days on record, registered when thermometers hit 15.6C in 1896 and 1920.

Even Scottish mountain peaks will have escaped snowfall.

Conditions for today and Boxing Day are likely to be cloudy, blustery and ‘unseasonably mild’.

In many parts of the country, temperatures will be several degrees warmer than average – without a snowflake in sight.

It’s certainly very different from this time last year, when the country was in the grip of a big freeze and some areas recorded their coldest ever temperature. 

For example at Altnaharra, in the Scottish Highlands, the mercury plummeted to -18c (-0.4f)

But this year, most of us will enjoy temperatures of between 11 and 13c (52 to 55f). The average is around 7 to 10c (45 to 50f)

In the South, East and North East temperatures could reach 14c (57f), which would make them the highest since 1997.

While there may be drizzle in the South and East, it will begin to clear and most of the country will remain dry  until Tuesday. 

Chris Bulmer, forecaster for the Met Office said: ‘It’s a stark contrast to last year. Temperatures will be mild for all parts of the UK.

'We are expecting it cloudy and dry, blustery in the North and breezy in the

‘This is due to a milder air mass.

'We’re likely to keep this general pattern through to the New Year and then there are likely to be some colder snaps.’

He added: ‘Last Christmas Day there were record minimum temperatures in Wales and Scotland.

‘After a short cooler interlude next midweek, the set-up which has brought the current milder conditions will return, with south-westerly winds.’

It means Britain may have a warmer 
Christmas than Athens, Barcelona and Nice, all of which are likely to 
experience temperatures of 11c (52f).

However, the temperatures will fall short of the Christmas Day record of 15.6c (60f), set in 1896.

Other forecasters predicted that, bizarrely, those in the North East could experience some of the warmest weather.

Paul
Michaelwhite, forecaster from the website Netweather, said: ‘Because of
fairly strong south-westerly winds, the North East could see some of 
the warmest temperatures, with 14c (57f) possible.

‘It
should make for ideal conditions for walking off the Christmas turkey –
although the west and north of Scotland will buck the trend with some 
heavy rain.’
