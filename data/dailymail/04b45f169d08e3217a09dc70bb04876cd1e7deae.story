For the first time in their long and impressive careers, internationally renowned photographers Bruce Weber and David Bailey have joined forces and the resulting project is stunning.

The lifelong friends explored the vibrant streets of Harlem in New York City for 24 hours this summer. As always, they did so through the lenses of their cameras.

Unlike most projects—or any project they’d ever done before, for that matter—this time those cameras were attached to smartphones.

Leaving their expensive professional gear at home, the legends were out to demonstrate the photographic power of the Nokia Lumia 1020.

The resulting collection is a testament to the legends' formidable talents, the dazzle and allure of Harlem in the summertime, and one phone’s ability to double as a truly superior camera.

'Nokia has created a smartphone which not only matches the capabilities of many high-end cameras, but in most cases surpasses them,’ said Weber. ‘It simplifies creative photography.'

Vivid: Legendary photographers Bruce Weber and David Bailey spent a hot summer day in Harlem in July capturing the vibrant spirit of the neighborhood using just smartphones

Gorgeous: The duo used only a Nokia Lumia 1020, and their formidable skills, to capture the neighborhood's summertime essence

Impressive: 'I don't do digital and this is the first time I have really gone out in the world and done like a digital sitting,' said Weber. 'I was impressed with the resolution and the beauty of the color'

Captivating:The duo was scheduled to take photos at a Harlem boxing studio, but along the way they found plenty of other engaging scenes to capture

'I've always loved it, it's always been my favorite place in New York City,' Weber said of Harlem. 'I've just always enjoyed the people'

On display: The London exhibition, entitled Weber X Bailey by Nokia Lumia 1020 will run until September 21 and features 30 of the dazzling photos

Mastery: 'The photos from Weber and Bailey¿s shoot are dazzling', said Nokia marketing VP Mark Newton. 'They are a reflection of Weber and Bailey¿s mastery of the art of photography'

'If it takes a picture, I'm going to use it': Weber said he was not intimidated at the prospect of a shoot done entirely with the Nokia phone, and was quite happy with the results

'I think the heat really brought a lot of people out, you know, in a different way,' Weber said. 'Some people were in bathing suits, some people were in big hats - it's kinda crazy!'

'This is the first time that I have used a mobile phone for my work,' said Weber, who shot in color, despite the fact that black-and-white imagery has defined his career

Volumes: Weber, pictured, took a combined 1,000 photos with Bailey. 30 of them will be displayed at the Nicholls & Clarke Building in Shoreditch in East London through September 21

'It was memorable spending the day in Harlem with Bruce showing me around,' said Bailey (pictured beside Weber at left)

The first exhibition from David Bailey and Bruce Weber's Harlem shoot will take place in London at the Nicholls & 
Clarke Building in Shoreditch between 13-21 September. For more information, visit Nokia.com/photography
