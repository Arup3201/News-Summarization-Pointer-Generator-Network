He was pronounced dead at Virtua Hospital in Berlin a short time later, said Camden police.

Timothy J Canfield, 25, has been charged with murder after he allegedly shot Paulsen with a compound bow and arrow at 11pm.

Authorities said that Canfield then attempted to hide the weapon, which is normally used to shoot deer, in 
woods close to Winslow Township.

Shortly before his death, Paulsen had been involved in a fistfight with another man outside a home where a woman he was dating lived.

Neighbors said there were often disturbances at the house and that the woman accused Paulsen of being the father of her son, which he denied. 

There were a number of by-standers who witnessed the fight before returning to their homes. Canfield had reportedly not been involved in the fight.

Lauren Palmer, the mother of Paulsen's five-year-old daughter, Aurora, told philly.com: 'He wasn't always the best person in
the world, and he did a lot of stupid stuff, but he wasn't malicious in
any way, and me and my daughter loved him.'

She said that she knew the alleged killer from high school and that Canfield dated another woman who lived with Paulsen's on-off girlfriend.

According to police sources, Paulsen was recently arrested for being inside his girlfriend's home without permission with a hypodermic needle. The 911 call was made by his alleged killer. 

Paulsen had previously been arrested over drugs and shoplifting.
