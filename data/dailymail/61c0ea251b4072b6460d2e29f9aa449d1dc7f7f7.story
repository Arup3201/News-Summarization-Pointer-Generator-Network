Accused: Sarah Lopez (right) falsely accused her fiance Russell Crowe of imprisoning her and threatening to stab her

A woman who falsely accused her toyboy fiance of taking her prisoner and threatening to stab her while brandishing five knives has been jailed for 10 months.

Sarah Lopez, 32, told police that her 21-year-old partner Russell Crowe gagged and bound her during an attack in Barry, south Wales.

She gave an eight-page statement to officers accusing Mr Crowe of a catalogue of abuse after claiming he had broken into her home and threatened to strike her with a glass.

However, after he spent 30 days behind bars awaiting trial, Lopez admitted to Mr Crowe's mother that she had made the whole thing up.

Prosecutor David Pugh told Cardiff Crown Court that the pair became engaged following a whirlwind romance in 2012, but things soured when Lopez she called 999 in May to report the alleged break in.

Mr Pugh said: 'She also alleged that two weeks before he had tied her to a chair, gagged her, and put a pillowcase over her head.

'She gave the police an eight-page statement claiming Mr Crowe was controlling and jealous.

'She told officers that during the first incident he had put five knives on the table and said: “Sit down, this is going to get ugly".

'She claimed she was petrified and believed Mr Crowe was going to hang himself.'

Mr Crowe was remanded in custody 
after being charged with false imprisonment, making threats to kill and 
assault, until his mother told investigating officers about Lopez's 
confession. Her statement was withdrawn in June.

Mr
Pugh added: 'She was reported to the police and arrested. She admitted 
she had exaggerated the incident and that Mr Crowe had not hurt her.

'She told officers she was devastated at him being remanded in custody.'

Jailing her for 10 months on Thursday, Judge Neil Bidder branded her actions 'wicked'.

He said: 'You made false allegations of serious criminal conduct against your then partner.

'As
a result, the police responded to an emergency call in which their time
was wasted, and most significantly, Mr Crowe was remanded in custody 
from May 30 until June 28.

'This was a wicked offence.'

Lopez was said to have convictions for 23 offences, including shoplifting, assault, possessing drugs, deception and harassment.

Sara Griffiths, defending, said Lopez was 'vulnerable' at the time she made the false accusations - and had been drunk at the time.

She said: 'At the time, she was drunk and confused, and accepted that what she did was wrong.

'She wishes to make up for what she did. She has been in custody for 65 days, which was a significant punishment in itself.'

Lopez was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £100.
