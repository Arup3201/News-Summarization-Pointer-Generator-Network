The British and American economies are storming ahead while the rest of Europe suffers, according to the latest figures.

A sharp fall in US unemployment figures yesterday sent shares on Wall Street to a record high while the London stock market also made gains in a boost to pension savings for millions of households in Britain.

The share price rally came as France was branded ‘the sick man of Europe’ amid signs it is holding back the recovery on the continent under the leadership of Socialist President Francois Hollande.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial research group Markit, said there are signs that ‘the euro area’s recovery is already fading’.

He added: ‘The UK economy is firing on all cylinders.

‘The UK and the US are showing similarly strong rates of growth while the eurozone is lagging.

‘France is the problem. France remains the weakest link in the region’s recovery story. It is certainly the sick man of Europe, and Europe is the sick man of the global picture.’

Markit’s index of activity in the UK economy – where 50 is the cut-off between growth and decline – dipped from 59.1 in May to a still robust 58.4 in June. That was far stronger than the 52.8 seen in the eurozone where Germany scored 54 and France just 48.1 – the steepest fall for four months.

Mr Williamson said the index of activity ‘makes grim reading’ for the eurozone.

He added: ‘Growth in the region’s main engine, Germany, is fading, while France has entered another downturn.’

But he said there are ‘grounds for optimism’ with the economies of Spain and Italy both showing signs of life.

US government figures showed unemployment in the world’s biggest economy fell to 6.1 per cent in June – its lowest level since the collapse of investment giant Lehman Brothers in September 2008 sparked the financial crisis.

The report showed 288,000 jobs were created in the US last month as the economy bounced back from a dismal start to the year when freezing weather disrupted business.

Unemployment of 6.1 per cent in the US compares with 6.6 per cent in the UK and 11.6 per cent in the eurozone.

But Markit predicted that the jobless rate in Britain could fall below 6 per cent by the end of the year as companies are taking on new employees in record numbers.

It also estimated that the economy grew by 0.8 per cent between April and June – meaning output has finally surpassed its pre-recession peak.

And Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets, hailed ‘the impressive pace of growth in the UK economy’, adding that output could have risen by as much as 1.1 per cent in the second quarter of the year.
