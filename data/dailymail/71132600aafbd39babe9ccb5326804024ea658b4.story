A country pub where Prince William once enjoyed romantic evenings with his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton has received a zero rating for food hygiene.

The Potting Shed, in Crudwell, Wiltshire, was investigated after a complaint, with the local council telling the business that there are 'clearly problems with managing food safety'.

In the run-up to the announcement their engagement in November 2010, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were regularly spotted emerging arm-in-arm from the pub - and, on one occasion, enjoying a passionate embrace.

Low marks: The Potting Shed Pub in Crudwell was given a zero rating for food hygiene

Favourite spot: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were once regulars at the Wiltshire drinking spot

Improving: Landlord Julian Muggridge says the pub has now overhauled its food preparation

Romantic: The couple were spotted enjoying several meals in the pub ahead of their 2010 engagement

But in the four years since the royal engagement, standards at the pub appear to have dropped - so much so it became the only business in north Wiltshire to get a zero rating this year.

Food hygiene, which is given a mark out of five, got zero - the worst rating - which means that drastic improvements are required. 

Pub co-owner Julian Muggridge said: 'On the August bank holiday, on which we were holding our annual Shed Fest festival, we were inspected by the Wiltshire food hygiene team.

'We were carrying more stock than is normal given the business levels expected over the weekend, we were also let down by a member of the team who was not following our food storage guidelines.

'This member of the team has since been removed from his post.

'We would like to assure the general public that all recommendations given have been adopted and all paperwork that was missing was instantly put in place and is up to date.

'We have recently been re-checked by the Wiltshire food hygiene team who have assured us that upon a re-scoring we will be reinstated to a top score, as we have been since we opened.

'We do sincerely apologise to our customers for this unintended oversight.'

A spokesman for Wiltshire Council said it inspected the pub following a complaint and there were 'clearly problems with managing food safety'.

He added: 'Our food safety officers gave instruction on what needed to be done to address these issues and since revisiting we can confirm these have been resolved and the owner has said he will apply for a review of his previous food hygiene rating score.'

When deciding on a rating council officers check how hygienically food is handled, the condition of the building and how the business manages its processes to make sure food is kept safely. 

To get a zero, a business must perform poorly in all three of these categories.
