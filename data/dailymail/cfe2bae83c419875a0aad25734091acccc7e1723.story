A husband and wife are facing federal charges for an alleged bank-robbing spree that spanned two states.

The Tampa Tribune reports that FBI agents arrested 28-year-old Immanuel Lee Williams and his wife, Cara Lee, this week at their Tampa home.

The two are accused of robbing 13 banks in Florida and two in Alabama. Authorities say they used disguises and notes to demand money.

Immanuel and Cara Lee Williams: A husband and wife team of bank robbers has been arrested in Florida. The couple were wanted in connection worth to the robberies of 15 banks in Florida and Lousiana

Federal investigators say the 
robberies took place between December 2012 and October of this year. 
Each of the suspects faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal 
prison.

Investigators
say the robberies followed a pattern. The couple allegedly used gloves,
afro-style wigs and demand notes written on yellow index cards.

A 10-month investigation by the FBI that began with a December 5 heist at Chase Bank in Tampa ended a day after 28-year Immanuel Lee Williams is said to have robbed an Alabama Credit Union in Gulf Shores (see pictures from the Alabama State Register below), and three days after his wife Cara Lee Williams, 28, allegedly held up Trinity Bank in Dothan.

An 18-page federal criminal complaint filed by the FBI outlines how agents matched the couple up with seven robberies that took place from December 2012 to February 2013 along with six more from August to October 2013 throughout Florida and the two in Alabama on Nov. 4 and Nov. 6.

The robberies netted a total of $54,740.

...and ended here at this bank in Dothan, Alabama

In all the bank robberies, except Dothan, Williams was known to wear an afro wig or hats. In each robbery, similar notes with block lettering were passed to bank tellers.

The note passed to the teller in Gulf Shores read, 'THIS IS A BANK ROBBERY! I HAVE A GUN, SO NO ALARMS & BE FAST!! GIVE ME ALL MONEY IN YOUR DRAWER! BE QUIET & FAST AND NO ONE WILL GET HURT!'

Federal agents got their first break during one of two robberies on Aug. 28 at Bank of America in Auburndale, Flordiaa and MidFlorida Credit Union in Davenport, east of Tampa and each 17 miles apart.

It was the one in Davenport, records show, where a nearby business’ surveillance camera captured the black male getting into a black 2011 Mercedes-Benz GLK 350.

Using video requested from the Florida Department of Transportation Turnpike Authority, agents were able to pinpoint the high-end sports utility vehicle and tracked the license plate number to Cara Williams.

A white Mustang that was used in an August 22 robbery in Fort Myers and captured on surveillance video was also linked to Cara Williams.

Getting away (but not for long): Immanuel Williams was able to be tracked thanks to activity through his cell phone, linking his location at certain dates to cell towers

The investigation intensified in September with physical FBI surveillance of the couple’s apartment in Tampa and their activity on September 27 when a MidFlorida Credit Union was robbed in Plant City, another city east of Tampa.

According to the court document, agents were also able to track Immanuel Williams’ activity through his cell phone, linking his location at certain dates to cell towers.

Public photos on Facebook were also use to identify a scar on Immanuel Williams’ left thumb that he would cover with cloth on his hand or obscure from the camera in bank surveillance video.

After two bank robberies in Ocala and Bushnell, north of Tampa, netted $6,960 the couple was observed afterward in a shopping mall.

Also through Facebook it was found that the couple had a baby around December 15, which was 10 days after the first bank robbery.

Further investigation delved into employment activities and off days that corresponded to robberies.

Cara Williams is a former resident of Alabama and her parents still live there, according to court records.

On November 4 witnesses from the Dothan bank robbery describe the suspect as a white woman in disguise and the note that was used was similar to the robberies in Florida.  Handwritten in black ink with all capital letters it read: 'THIS IS A BANK ROBBERY! I HAVE A GUN SO BE QUIET & FAST & NO ONE GETS HURT! HAND ME ALL YOUR 20s, 100s, & 50s! BE FAST & NO ALARMS!!'

Immanuel Lee Williams is being held without bail. A bond hearing for Cara Lee Williams is set for November 14.

The couple were charged with conspiracy to obstruct, delay or affect commerce by robbery, and conspiracy to commit bank robbery, both of which can carry a maximum prison sentence of up to 20 years.
