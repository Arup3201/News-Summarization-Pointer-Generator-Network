An ex-football player turned personal trainer shot and killed a man in a Whole Foods Market car park in Carrollwood, Florida, on Tuesday morning.

David Saunders, 37, who played for the Tampa Bay Storm between 2002 and 2005, was questioned by police but hasn’t been arrested.

Saunders claims he fired in self defense because the other man was coming at him with a knife.

Ex-football player turned personal trainer David Saunders shot and killed a man in a Whole Foods Market car park in Carrollwood, Florida, on Tuesday morning

The dead man has been named as Deshaun Gregory, 31, of Tampa. He died of a single gunshot to the head.

‘Two men were involved in a verbal altercation and one fired a round at the other, killing him,’ sheriff’s spokesman Larry McKinnon told The Tampa Tribune.

The altercation is believed to have been related to Gregory’s girlfriend, who was being personally trained by Saunders.

She was also present at the crime scene and hasn’t been named because she is a witness in the on-going investigation, said McKinnon.

The altercation took place on Tuesday morning in a Whole Foods car park and is believed to have been related to Deshaun Gregory's girlfriend, who was being personally trained by David Saunders

When police arrived they found Gregory’s body lying in the lot next to Saunders’ white sport-utility vehicle.

Police believe Gregory and his girlfriend had been parked in the Whole Foods’ lot arguing about Saunders.

Gregory spotted Saunders in his vehicle behind the store and walked across the parking lot to confront the personal trainer, who had gotten out of his vehicle, McKinnon said.

At some point, Gregory pulled an 8-inch kitchen knife and began moving toward Saunders, McKinnon said. They fought and during the struggle, a shot was fired by Saunders, he said.

Detectives are looking into the backgrounds of the three to determine what may have motivated the incident.

The investigation will be turned over to the Hillsborough County State Attorney’s Office, which will review the case to determine if criminal charges will be filed.

Saunders played wide receiver for West Virginia and holds the record for most career receiving yards with 2,608 yards and the record for most career receptions with 191.

After leaving the Mountaineers in 1998, he left football for two years, but signed with the New Jersey Red Dogs of the Arena Football League in 2000.

He began playing with the Storm two years later and was named the team’s Most Valuable Player in 2002. In 2003, he was part of the Storm’s AFL ArenaBowl XVII championship team.

He left the team in 2006 to play with the Grand Rapids Rampage and returned to the Storm for part of the 2008 season, but was traded to the Arizona Rattlers, who released him at the end of the season, drawing his eight-year AFL career to a close.
