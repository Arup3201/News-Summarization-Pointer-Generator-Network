London Broncos' relegation from the First Utility Super League ends an unbroken 19-year stay in the top flight, but comes as little surprise.

Installed as clear favourites to drop into the Kingstone Press Championship back in February, the Broncos' fate was confirmed on Sunday when they lost 72-12 at Warrington.

It extended their record losing run to 20 matches and left them 15 points adrift of safety with seven matches left of the regular season.

The London club were one six ever-presents in the top flight since the advent of Super League and the switch to summer rugby in 1996.

They include Bradford, who could lose their top-flight status next Sunday pending the outcome of their High-Court bid for the re-instatement of the six points they were docked for going into administration earlier this year.

The Broncos, formed as Fulham in 1980, endured a yo-yo existence up to being given special status when the big switch came 19 years ago and they justified their inclusion by finishing as runners-up to champions Bradford in 1997.

They were one of the few British successes in the ill-fated 1997 World Club Championship, famously beating Mal Meninga's Canberra Raiders in front of a packed house at the The Stoop, and reached the Challenge Cup final in 1999, when Richard Branson led the team out at Wembley in jeans and open-top shirt.

However, when Branson eventually withdrew his Virgin backing, it signalled a decline which gradually turned into a downward spiral as the club lurched from one crisis to another.

Despite the heavy financial commitment of London-based businessman David Hughes, the crowds diminished as the club continued its nomadic trail around the capital and, despite brief forays into the play-offs in 2003 and 2005, they generally hovered near the foot of the table.

Only late surges spared them the wooden spoon in each of the last two seasons, but the writing was on the wall at the end of 2013 when the club found itself on the brink once more following their departure from The Stoop.

Head coach Tony Rea, who has been connected with the club in various roles since before the advent of Super League, reckoned it "died five times" before being thrown a lifeline by Barnet owner Tony Kleanthous, but it was a threadbare team that made the move to The Hive.

Rea was still putting a new-look squad together when the season kicked off and it was no surprise when he made way in May for the promotion of his assistant Joey Grima.

The move came too late for Grima to prevent the inevitable and for the last two months he has been preparing the way for a new start in the Championship, with a raft of new signings and the appointment of an assistant coach.

It promises to be a difficult route back to the top flight, but Grima is up for the fight.
