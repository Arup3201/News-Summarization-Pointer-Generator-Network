They're both blessed with an outrageous ginger tuft of hair and a cold beady stare, so it's no wonder people think this canary and billionaire business tycoon Donald Trump are birds of a feather.

The colourful lookalike for the property magnate turned TV star was spotted by nature photographer Sandy Wiskeman as it perched on a branch in a park in New Jersey.

The bird, which is a Gloster Canary, was easy to spot among leaves thanks to its unusual crown of feathers, which almost appears toupee-like.

But it wasn't until later that the photographer realised that odd looking bird reminded her of a familiar face.

The swept back style of its feathers is almost identical to Donald Trump's famoulsy manipulated mane.

The 67-year-old star of the US Apprentice, who is said to be worth $5bn, is known for trying to maintain an even covering on his head by back-combing his thinning hair, often with disastrous results.

One of Trumps most memorable hair-raising moments came when he visited the Scottish Highlands to announce plans to build a golf course on the Isle of Lewis.

A highlight of the controversial press trip was the businessman's constant battle to keep his hair under control in the bracing northern winds.

Thankfully, Trump's canary companion doesn't have to worry about its headgear being disturbed by such heavy weather.

The Gloster Canary is a popular choice of pet which is kept for its beautiful song as well as its stylish crest.
