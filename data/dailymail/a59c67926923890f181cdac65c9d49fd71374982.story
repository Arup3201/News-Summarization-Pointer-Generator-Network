Thousands of previously unpublished Boy Scouts of America files that detail suspected sexual abuse by employees and volunteers, including doctors, teachers and priests, have been posted online.

TheÂ Los Angeles Times published the horrifying database with redacted victims' names on Tuesday, including material that was released earlier by an Oregon Supreme Court judge's ruling.

The Boy Scouts kept the files - numbering almost 2,000 - for internal use for nearly a century, and they now reveal the systematic coverups by the organisation, which in turn led to more abuse.

The group has only conducted criminal background checks on volunteers since 2008 and finally, in 2010, the organization mandated any suspected abuse be reported to police.

In an analysis of the records, which span from 1985 to 1991, the Times found that reports of abuse increased over time, which may be the result of greater awareness of child sexual abuse.

The reports are not believed to account for all abuse, because the Scouts say an unknown number of files were destroyed over the years and not all victims report the crimes committed against them.

The organization's inaction, and its efforts to keep allegations from police, parents and the public, allowed molesters to continue sexually abusing children, according to The Times.

The released files reveal that a Scouts committee chairman of four years, Samuel J. Becker, had a record of child molestation, had served prison time and was on probation for exposing himself.

In another file, a Scoutmaster said he had reported suspicions of abuse about Scout Leader Gary L. Findlay of Illinois, but he was ignored by a superior. Findlay was later accused of abusing a 15-year-old in 1986, convicted of sexual abuse and expelled from the Scouts.

A review by the newspaper found that 
Scouting officials often urged offenders who admitted to carrying out 
the abuse to quietly resign while helping others to cover their tracks.

In about 80 per cent of cases that the 
Scouts learned about, there is no record of officials reporting the 
allegations to police, and in more than 100 of the cases, officials 
actively sought to hide the abuse, The Times found.

Sick example: In one of the files, assistant troop leader William Lazzareschi is kicked out of the Scouts after making a boy perform a sex act on him. There is no suggestion leaders called police

And the examples of what they got away with are horrifying.

One case details Arthur W. 
Humphries, a Scout leader with 50 years of experience and numerous Scouting awards - yet also a serial child molester.

When he was arrested in 1984,  local Scouting official Jack Terwilliger claimed no one had known about Humpries' crimes, yet just six years earlier, Terwilliger had told officials to interview a boy who claimed Humphries had repeatedly performed oral sex on him.

'He then told me to do the same and I did,' the 12-year-old boy said in a 1978 statement.

Officials did not report
Humphries' alleged crime to police and even gave him a glowing reference two years later when he applied for a post at a 
national Scouting event, the Times found.

Humphries continued to work with the Scouts 
and abused at least five more boys before police stopped him in 1984 after acting on a tip.

He was found guilty of abusing 20 Scouts, some as 
young as eight, and was sentenced to 151 years behind bars. He is now deceased.

In an earlier case, five Scouts detailed two rapes and other sex abuses by a scoutmaster in Pennsylvania and he promptly resigned, saying he had to travel for work.

In response, a troop representative wrote: 'Good luck to you in your new position', adding that he was accepting the resignation 'with extreme regret'.

In October, the Scouts unsealed 1,247 confidential files and the organisation offered an apology and counseling to victims.

'We have heard from victims of abuse 
and are doing our very best to respond to each person with our utmost 
care and sensitivity,' Scouting spokesman Deron Smith said at the time.

But in the years leading up to the files' 
release, victims said they were the ones who were blamed.

At a trial in 2010, an Oregon man alleged that the Scout organisation allowed troop leader Timur Dykes to continue working after he admitted molesting 17 boys in the early 1980s.

In a shocking move at the hearing, regional Scouts official Eugene Grant blamed parents for letting their sons go to the man's apartment for merit badge work and sleepovers.

'His parents should have known better,' Grant said of one victim. 'I think it's criminal.'

But the jury rejected that assertion, finding the Scouts liable for nearly $20 million in damages.

Most of the files opened after 1991 haven't been released. Various pending lawsuits were seeking those files.

SHOCKING STORIES OF ABUSE FROM FORMER BOY SCOUTS

Tom and Matt Stewart by be 
middle-aged men now, but the abuse they suffered for a decade as Boy 
Scouts still haunts them to this day.

'I still have some nightmares to this day of abuse,' said Tom Stewart, pictured, who says the abuse went on from ages 8-18.

The
 brothers say the Boy Scouts of America turned their backs on them when 
they needed support the most, as they were arrested at their home, 
during camping trips and elsewhere.

They settled out-of-court after suing the Boy Scouts in 2003.

In
 another shocking case, a scoutmaster admitted to raping a 17-year-old 
boy on a camping trip and otherwise sexually molesting two other boys; 
the victims corroborated his confession.

But no charges were ever filed.

The
 man was let off with a warning that should he be found with young men 
in the future, he was subject to immediate incarceration at the state 
prison.

The man 'was asked 
to leave the parish, and if he was caught around or near any boy or 
youth organization, he would be sent to state prison immediately,' a 
Scouting executive wrote to national headquarters. 'We are indeed sorry 
that Scouting was involved.'

In Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in August 1962, a married 25-year-old steel mill worker with a high school education pleaded guilty to 'serious morals' violations involving Scouts.

The Scouting executive who served as both mayor and police chief made sure of one thing: The Scouting name was never brought up.

It went beyond the mayor to a three-judge panel, who also deemed it important to keep the Scouts' names out of the press.

'No mention of Scouting was involved in the case in as much as two of the three judges who pronounced sentence are members of our Executive Board,' the Scouts executive wrote to the national personnel division.

In August 1966, a boy at an unknown Scout camp reported he was molested by a rifle instructor.

The camp director didn't believe the boy so he sent the Scout back out onto the rifle range and hid nearby to see what would happen.

He saw the instructor molest the boy twice, according to the camp director's memo.

Afterwards, the camp director held a meeting with the local scoutmaster.

They were joined by the boys' parents.

The meeting closed with all parties agreeing that the instructor would be 'quietly dismissed,' and to 'keep our knowledge private.'
