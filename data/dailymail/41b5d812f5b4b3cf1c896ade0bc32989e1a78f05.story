Ariel Castro kept his former wife tied up in his basement and whipped her with dog chains, according to her former boyfriend, foreshadowing the horrific crimes he would later allegedly inflict on his three captives.

Fernando Colon, who welcomed Castro's wife Nilda Figueroa into his home after she left her abusive husband, said that the man would viciously kick her in the stomach while she was pregnant.

Castro similarly beat his kidnapped victims, Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus, after he raped them and they fell pregnant, according to reports.

He has been charged with three counts of rape and four counts of kidnapping after Berry managed to escape the Cleveland home on Monday and alerted authorities to their horrendous plight.

arrested for allegedly imprisoning three missing girls for ten years, also locked his wife, Nilda Figueroa (right), in the basement and beat her, a former boyfriend has said

Speaking to the New York Post, Colon recounted the treatment Figueroa, who passed away last year, allegedly suffered at the hands of her former husband.

'He kept her tied up in the basement,' he said. 'He used to whip her with dog chains. She wasn’t allowed to go out... He pretty much kept her locked up in there.'

He added that Castro would push her down the stairs and kick her in an attempt to abort her babies. Even after she underwent brain surgery, Castro would hit her in the head, Colon said.

Court records from 2005 claim that Figueroa suffered two broken noses, shattered ribs, a blood clot on the brain, a knocked-out tooth and two dislocated shoulders at the hands of her former husband.

The documents, which emerged this week, also claim that Castro 
'frequently abducts his daughters and keeps them from mother' and would 
frequently threaten to kill Figueroa.

'Former crimes': Ariel Castro was arrested in 1993 for domestic abuse but was not indicted

Colon worked at the hospital where Figueroa was frequently sent for treatment for her injuries and, moved by what he saw, he invited her to live with him and his parents, he said.

They went on to have a child, which infuriated Castro and he accused Colon of molesting his daughters. When the case ended up in court, Castro's son said it was lies, Colon said.

The judge dropped the charges but Colon still served three years probation.

Colon said that authorities once questioned whether he was responsible for the disappearances of the girls, but that he countered they should look at Castro instead. He told the Post that police never followed up on his suggestion.

The 2005 filing, which lists Figueroa's injuries, asked the court to 
pass a protection order banning Castro from contacting his former wife or their
children and from harassing them.

It requested that a judge 'keep [Castro] from threatening to kill [Figueroa]', The Plain Dealer reported, claiming that he had threatened to kill her three or four times already that year.

Figueroa's brother, Jose, told RadarOnline that he believes Castro's treatment of his former wife caused her to die. She passed away from brain cancer in April last year.

'I believe he murdered my sister,' he said. 'He abused her for years. She had multiple instances of serious head trauma and it created a brain tumor in her head.'

Of the treatment, Jose added: 'My sister was in hell living with him. She was trapped there and there was nothing we could do. She was afraid of him.'

Police records show that Castro was arrested for domestic violence in 1993, but that a grand jury declined to indict him.

But in 1996, she escaped to a woman's shelter with the couple's children, Angie, Emily, Anthony and Rosie. In January 1997, she was awarded full custody of the children.

After
the 2005 filing, a temporary protection order was granted instructing 
Castro to stay away from the family. It also banned him from owning a 
deadly weapon, using drugs or alcohol.

Castro signed it but it was dismissed two months 
later when Figueroa's lawyer was unable to attend a scheduled 
hearing in the case due to another court commitment, The Telegraph reported.

Speaking to MailOnline, one of
Castro's sons, Anthony, depicted his father as a violent, controlling 
man who nearly beat his mother to death in 1993 while she was recovering
from brain surgery.

'Having that relationship with my dad all these years when we lived in a
house where there was domestic violence and I was beaten as well... we 
never were really close because of that,' he said.

In 1996, Castro was accused of
pulling a fence post from a neighbor's property amid a dispute and the 
neighbor's six-year-old daughter later fell in the hole and hurt 
herself.

Castro, who said in court documents he had called police repeatedly about the neighbor, was ordered to pay $241 in damages.

Locked up: Three missing women were found at this home, owned by Castro, in Cleveland on Monday

Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she 
vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was 
16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday

Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing

On
Monday, Castro was arrested along with his two brothers after three 
women who had allegedly been held captive at his Cleveland home for a 
decade were found by authorities.

Amanda Berry, 26, who disappeared in 2003, was heard screaming by a neighbor, who helped her escape through a screen door. She used a neighbor's phone to call 911.

Gina Dejesus, 23, who went missing in 2004, and Michelle Knight, 32, who vanished in 2002, were also found alive at the home. They were taken to hospital with a six-year-old girl, who was born to Berry while she was in captivity.

It appears that his treatment of his wife was just the beginning of the horror he inflicted on women.

Police confirmed on Wednesday that they found ties and chains inside the home to restrain the girls, while the victims allegedly suffered miscarriages after being assaulted and then beaten at the home.

Local police sources revealed that 
Ariel Castro would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run
away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried 
to run free.

This is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling.

He also reportedly turned the home into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the back.

He used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in.
