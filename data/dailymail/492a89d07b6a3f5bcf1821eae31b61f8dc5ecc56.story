Experts estimate that one third of nine to 12-year-olds in the UK have a Facebook page despite rules that say only those aged 13 or over can sign up

Parents are responsible for the rise of young  children using Facebook, an executive from the website warned yesterday.

Simon Milner, policy director for Facebook in the UK and Ireland, was joined by Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology of the London School of Economics, in warning that parents were flouting the site’s age restrictions by either helping their children create accounts or failing to be firm with them and stop them from signing up.

As a result youngsters who use Facebook risk  being exposed to porn and online grooming.

The site sets a minimum membership age of 13, however Mr Milner admits there is ‘no mechanism’ to stop youngsters lying about how old they are.

Professor Livingstone said figures from two years ago show that 34 per cent of nine to 12-year-olds in the UK had a Facebook profile, adding it ‘can only have gone up since then’. She suggested the starting age was reaching school years five to six, or children aged ten to 11.

Speaking at the Oxford Media Convention, Professor Livingstone, who researches children and internet use, urged parents to be stricter, saying: ‘If parents say “no, you’re too young”, young children will listen to that…Parents should say no.’

Blocked: Users must vouch that they are 13 or older to sign up for the website but many children simply lie about their age

Mr Milner, who was at the same event, 
said: ‘I am well aware of research which shows there are a lot of 11, 
12, or even younger children who have Facebook accounts and lie about 
their age.

'The research also shows that, in the great majority, parents 
not only know about this but actually help their children do this. Just 
to be clear, we don’t condone it.’

He admitted preventing under-age 
children from signing on was a ‘tricky’ area: ‘We haven’t got a 
mechanism for eradicating the problem.’

Spot checks and a reporting system are in place in an attempt to protect youngsters, he said.

He told the Oxford Media Convention it cannot make every user prove their age 
as it 'would get privacy advocates up in arms'.

However, he said the company neither 'condones' nor 'condemns' parents but says it is their decision.

Facebook rules state that anybody under 
13 cannot use the website but there is nothing stopping a young child 
from lying when asked to enter their date of birth.

Mr Milner told the event: 'You can't make everyone prove their age … that would get privacy advocates up in arms.'

He added that the under-13s rule was in place not because Facebook is 'unsafe' but because of a US children's online privacy law.

The site does have strict rules about 
bullying and grooming and Mr Milner said policing Facebook would not be 
given to an external company.
