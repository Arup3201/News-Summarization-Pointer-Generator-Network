Indian victims of horrific acid attacks are relying on the generosity of strangers to help them after failing to get any financial support from their government.

Acid attacks are sadly not uncommon in India, often targeting women in public places as a form of revenge linked to family disputes, sexism or misogyny.

One victim, Reshma Qureshi, 18, was disfigured and lost an eye after her brother-in-law and his friends pinned her down and doused her face with acid.

Target: It is thought Reshma Qureshi, 18, was singled out for an attack because of her beauty and popularity

Reshma's elder sister Gulshan, whose estranged husband carried out the attack in May, witnessed the assault and suffered burns on her arms, but wishes she had been the main target.

The family believe Reshma was singled out because of her beauty and popularity.

The once pretty and out-going commerce student now describes her face as 'so scary' as she has an empty eye socket and painful scars. She no longer socialises with friends but hides away in her family's cramped Mumbai home.

She faces lifelong scars and the social stigma attached to being an acid attack victim. 

Reshma should have received swift state aid after India's top court ruled that victims were entitled to 100,000 rupees (£1015) within 15 days of an assault and a total of 300,000 rupees (£3046) in compensation.

But, five months later, she is yet to receive a penny.

'One of my eyes is ruined, yet no help is coming,' said Reshma.

Reshma, the adored youngest child of a taxi driver, was attacked in her family's northern home state of Uttar Pradesh, and the fact that she lives in Mumbai complicates her claim.

Her relatives have clubbed together and taken out loans for her treatment, but doctors have said she may need up to 10 more operations.

'After that things will be better, but still nothing will be alright,' Reshma said.

Now she is relying on donations to help her get the treatment she needs after the volunteer network 'Make Love Not Scars', have set up a crowdfunding page on the website Indiegogo on her behalf. 

The immediate target is £1,367, although her overall costs are expected to be much higher. 

The group have previously successfully raised money for another Indian acid attack victim, Rekha, who is now receiving treatment.

Make Love Not Scars turned to the internet to help victims after becoming frustrated by the lack of government aid. 

Reshma and Rekha are not the only ones who haven't received compensation despite the steps taken to help improve the situation for survivors. 

Alok Dixit of the New Delhi-based Stop Acid Attacks campaign group said: 'Still there's no awareness on the issue... People don't know how to apply for compensation. The authorities don't know.'

He said he knew of no-one who had received the initial 100,000 rupees within 15 days of an assault, while only two in 100 cases had managed to win the full 300,000 rupees.

He added that even if claims were successful, the figure is 'not at all enough' for the costly and multiple plastic surgeries required.

Bringing the perpetrators of acid attacks to justice is another controversial area.

Last year, acid attacks were made a specific criminal offence in India punishable with at least a decade behind bars. But court cases can drag on for years.

In Reshma's case, her brother-in-law was arrested and jailed, but a juvenile in the gang has been freed on bail and two other accomplices remain at large, according to her family.

'The police don't say anything, they don't search anything,' Reshma said.

She added that she wants them apprehended so 'they should not be able to do to other girls what they have done to me.'

Bhagirath Iyer of Make Love Not Scars added that, particularly in northern states, 'police are not very cooperative and we have heard of cases where they try to get families to change their statement.'

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court in July last year gave Indian states three months to enforce restrictions on the sale of acid, but campaigners say it remains easy to purchase - making future attacks likely.
