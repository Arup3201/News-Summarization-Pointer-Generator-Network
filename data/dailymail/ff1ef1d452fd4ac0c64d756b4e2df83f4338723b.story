Monaco are 
prepared to offer Arsene Wenger a staggering £12.4million a year, after
 tax, to take over from Claudio Ranieri at the end of the season.

Though
 the Arsenal manager has turned down overtures from Real Madrid and 
Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco have been encouraged by the uncertainty 
surrounding his future at the Emirates and are ready to tempt him with a
 salary equivalent to £22m in the UK — three times the £7.5m he 
currently earns.

On his way? Monaco hope to tempt Arsene Wenger with a massive offer at the end of the season

Monaco are desperate to bring a celebrated manager to the club when they compete in the Champions League next season, having secured qualification last weekend.

But while former Chelsea boss Ranieri has proved a success in winning promotion and securing Champions League football, they remain 10 points behind leaders PSG. Russian owner Dmitri  Rybolovlev is expected to dismiss him this month and is seeking to appoint one of Europe’s elite managers.

For Wenger it would provide an emotional return to the club he managed from 1987 to 1994, when he was sacked despite having taken them to the Champions League semi-final.

However, it would also  represent a considerable  U-turn in his philosophy about football, given he  has been critical of Chelsea’s oligarch-funded success, labelling it ‘financial doping.’

And there are huge issues surrounding Monaco’s lavish spending and UEFA’s new financial fair play regulations.

But Monaco have been emboldened by Wenger’s reluctance to sign a new Arsenal contract, which runs out this year.

Not good enough: Monaco have qualified for Champions League but remain 10 points behind leaders PSG

He has said his future will not be 
determined by the result of the FA Cup final and those who know Wenger 
well believe it is more likely he will decide on the basis of whether 
the fans want him to continue.

Though Arsenal are planning their 
summer transfers and pre-season training on the basis that he will stay,
 even those close to the  manager think he has yet to make up his mind.

Wenger,
 64, has said he has no other jobs on the horizon, and last night told 
beIN Sport radio: ‘I’ve given my word to this club that I want to 
continue where I am’.

But were he to leave Arsenal, several clubs would 
be interested.

Meanwhile, Lukas Podolski will seek talks with Wenger
 after the FA Cup final as he considers his future.

The Germany striker 
has cut a frustrated figure, spending plenty of time warming the bench.

An
 early-season hamstring injury that kept him out for four months hasn’t 
helped, nevertheless  Podolski’s lack of action is a major issue for the
 forward.

The former Cologne star has been back in Wenger’s plans in 
recent weeks, making five starts in succession and scoring four goals in
 the process.

But Podolski fears he will be back on the bench next 
season, particularly when Theo Walcott returns from injury.

The 
28-year-old will seek clarification before the World Cup regarding 
Wenger’s plans for next season.

Bacary Sagna has also taken a step 
closer to leaving after Wenger confirmed the Frenchman has not responded
 to the club’s third and final contract offer.

The right back’s deal 
expires at the end of the season, with sources close to the player 
insisting Sagna is ‘almost certain’ to go.
