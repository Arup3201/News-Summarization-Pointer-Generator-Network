The two friends of Mathilda Vazille who watched as the 13-year-old was struck by a car have spoken about witnessing the sickening incident.

Bella Amato and Chiara Tisamo were right behind Mathilda when she was crossing Warringah Rd, Narraweena in Sydney just after 7pm on Saturday.

'She kind of went about like three or four metres up in the air and flipped and she went head first and hit a brick fence,' Bella said.

'I thought I was imagining everything and I looked at Chiara and just went like – "did this happen?"'.

The girls explained how they were crossing the road when the pedestrian lights turned from a clear green to a flashing red, but Mathilda carried on crossing.

'You just have that instinct to just keep running because she was so close to the path,' Chiara explained.

But before she could reach the other side, a car pulled out from behind the waiting traffic, hitting the young girl who was rushed to hospital with severe head injuries shortly afterwards.

'All of a sudden just this car came out of nowhere just speeding past and it just hit her,' Bella said.

Bella's mother, Sogna Amato, also told Channel Nine about the terrifying phone call she received form her daughter at the scene.

'All I heard was screaming and crying, she was just screaming 'Matilda, the car, the car!"', Ms Amato said.

Ms Usai said residents were accustomed to accidents at the notorious intersection.

Shortly afterwards police and paramedics arrived and Mathilda was flown to Royal North Shore hospital in a ­critical condition.
