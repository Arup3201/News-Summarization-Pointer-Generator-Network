It is the sort of story which sounds like it's out of a movie script but this really happened. 

Father-of-three Paul Furkert, 43, has spent the last 12 years lovingly restoring his 1949 Land Rover and on Saturday morning he decided to take it for a test drive  in preparation for a future journey.

Mr Furkert lives in Carterton, a small town around 90km from captial city Wellington, New Zealand, so the area is full of remote country tracks perfect for testing out four-by-four vehicles. 

Paul Furkert is resting up at home with his family, including 12-year-old daughter, Xanthe, at home 

This is what the Land Rover looked like 12 years ago when he started restoring it from scratch 

Around 9am the IT consultant left his home to go and test out the his prized set of wheels and he told his son Aidan, 14, that he shouldn't be out for very long. 

Mr Furkert told Daily Mail Australia that as he was driving along the top of a 1100m-high ridge a 'rogue' gust of wind toppled the green vehicle and sent it rolling down the hillside. 

The model, which Mr Furkett had restored from scratch, did not have seat belts. 

Father-of-three Mr Furkert is laid up at home in Carterton, New Zealand after the accident on Saturday 

He said: 'This happened down a remote down the back of a farm and the wind made it roll one and a half times and the vehicle ended up on its roof.' 

Mr Furkett managed to free himself from the vehicle and that was when he realised he had a broken leg. 

He told Daily Mail Australia: 'I got myself out of the Range Rover so it would not roll over me. 

'I knew that my leg was broken and so I decided to try and make a splint because I was in a lot of pain. 

'I unbolted one of the support struts for the canvas roof, removed one of the ropes that attaches the canvas to the side of the vehicle and used these to keep my leg straight. 

'I had had first aid training and it ended up not being too painful when I put the splint in place.

'I settled in and ended up watching some wild goats who were on the hillside, it was pretty high up and and I watched the sun move from one side of the hillside to the other.'  

He said: 'We had a big garage and I thought why don't I restore a Land Rover, I had no mechanical experience'

Mr Furkert did not have a mobile phone with him and he said he knew he would be waiting for a while for someone to come and rescue him. 

After seven hours of patient waiting a lone horse rider came across Mr Furkett stranded on the hillside. 

The horse rider didn't have a phone either and she had to go back for help. 

More than 30 rescuers eventually arrived and Mr Furkett could only be accessed by four by four vehicles. 

This is what the Land Rover looked like when it was fully restored by Mr Furkert over the 12 years 

The Life Flight Trust air ambulance crew were able to land on top of the ridge and pick him up, reported the NZ Herald. 

Mr Furkert said: 'It was pretty windy and the alternative was to trek him on a stretcher down 6km of 'rough tracks'. 

He described to the NZ Herald how even police officers in a four-wheel drive found it difficult to get to him on the gravel tracks. 

'I heard one of them went into a ditch on the way out.' 

Mr Furkett said he would be in a plastic cast for three months and said 'I will get back on the road eventually'.
