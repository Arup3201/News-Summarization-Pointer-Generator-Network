The online activist group, known as Anonymous, has threatened to shut down Zynga and Facebook, days after the gaming giant announced it was laying off 5 per cent of its workforce.

The group is targeting the San Francisco based company because of 'the outrageous treatment of their employees and their actions against many developers,' an unidentified member of the group, donning their trademark Guy Fawkes mask, announced in a YouTube video posted on Sunday.

Slamming the tech firm for slashing its employee base while sitting on 'billion dollars cash,' the hackers threatened to release games it has stolen from Zynga's server, in addition to shutting down both Zynga and Facebook on November 5.

Warning: The online activist group known as Anonymous has threatened to shut down Zynga and Facebook on November 5, which marks Guy Fawkes Day

Threat: The group planned its attack in retaliation against Zynga's announcement it would cut 5 per cent of its staff and would outsource many of those jobs to India

The looming threat to take down the social networking sites comes after Zynga unveiled a restructuring plan in the wake of its disappointing third quarter earnings report on October 24.

Zynga CEO Mark Pincus announced last week it would lay off five per cent of its workforce, of approximately 3,000, shutting down its office in Boston and slashing the staff at the company's Austin branch.

The company is also said to be looking at closing operations in the UK and Japan.

The downsizing came as Zynga announced the company lost $52.7 million, or 7 cents per share in the past quarter.

The company CEO described the layoffs 
as necessary 'to streamline our operations, focus our resources on our 
most strategic opportunities, and invest in our future,' in a memo to 
staff last week.

'As part of these changes, we’ve had 
to make some tough decisions around products, teams and people.'

Plan: The group dubbed their campaing #OP maZYNGA and plans to roll out their attack in multiple phases

Layoffs: Zynga CEO Mark Pincus (speaking at a San Francisco event on October 11) said last week the layoffs were necessary 'to streamline operations'

'We don’t take these decisions 
lightly as we recognize the impact to our colleagues and friends who 
have been on this journey with us. We appreciate their amazing 
contributions and will miss them.'

In addition to staff cuts, the company is also retiring some of its older games.

Though Zynga dominated the early 
online gaming market, with its widely popular FarmVille and Words With Friends, it has been 
losing out to competitors like King.com, Wooga and Kixeye, in addition 
to the mobile arena where it has lost market share.

The latest news from Zynga could mean 
even more problems for Facebook, as the gaming unit accounted for 14 per
 cent of Facebook's total revenue for the first six months of 2012.

Facebook has failed to impress Wall 
Street in the aftermath of its hyped IPO in May, as many analysts wonder
 if Mark Zuckerberg can really deliver a profit.

That said, Zynga has announced it 
will enter the gambling business and combined with its cost cutting 
measures and staff reductions, shares were actually up last Wednesday as investors seemed 
pleased with the company's vision to move past this rough patch.

So with its stock on the rise, the 
online group is taking on the gaming giant - accusing the company of throwing its employees 
under the bus while executives reap the benefits of increased investor 
confidence.

In an operation dubbed #OP maZYNGA, a
 posting from Anonymous on the AnonNews website stated it would retaliate with a multiphase 
effort to hit the tech company where it hurts.

The group has claimed to have 
accessed Zynga's server and has obtained confidential 
communication to executives about the company's strategy, which 
allegedly includes plans for further layoffs and increased outsourcing to 
Bangalore, India.

In the next phase of its attack, Anonymous plans to release code of Zynga games and even plans to shut 
down both the gaming site and Facebook.

Zynga customers and Facebook users, We are anonymous.

During the last few days anonymous has been targeting Zynga for the outrageous treatment of their employees and their actions against many developers.

We have come to believe that this actions of Zynga will result in massive layoff of a thousand people and legal actions against everyone that speaks to the public about this plan.

It will also come to end of the US game market as we know it as all this jobs will be replaced in other more convenient financial countries.

With a billion dollars cash sitting in a bank we do believe that such actions are an insult to the population and the behaviour of corporations like Zynga must change.

Anonymous could not allow this to happen so it's starting to release confidential documents we have leaked on this plan.

As we speak we are planning to release also all the games we've taken from their servers for free.

That being said we will stop the idea of the distribution of such games if Zynga will cease immediately the plan.

'On November the fifth we will release the key to the data files. Remember, remember the 5TH of November,' the group said.

November 5 marks Guy Fawkes Day, which commemorates the day in 1605 when Guy Fawkes joined a group of Roman Catholic conspirators who tried to blow up the British Parliament.

The group of hackers, whose members don masks
 of the English rebellion leader, are a loosely organized body who protest government surveillance of the web.

They have taken responsibility for taking down many government websites, in addition to launching cyber attacks on major corporations.

The internet social activists formed 
in 2003 and have since thrown their support behind progressive causes 
like Julian Assange's WikiLeaks and Occupy Wall Street.

Anonymous had previously threatened to shut down Facebook on November 5, 2011.

'If you are a willing hacktivist or a guy who just wants to protect the freedom of information then join the cause and kill Facebook for the sake of your own privacy,' the group said in a statement last year about the lack of privacy on the site.

'Facebook has been selling information to government agencies and giving clandestine access to information security firms so that they can spy on people from all around the world.'

Despite the threat, Zuckerberg's social network escaped unscathed last year.
