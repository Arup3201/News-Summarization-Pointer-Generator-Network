This is the astonishing sight of an angel in the skies just days before Christmas - although rather than being over Nazareth, this time it was just outside East Anglia.

Sherrie Abbott had been driving on the A17 between Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, and Kings Lynn, Norfolk, to visit her sister when she spotted the formation in the otherwise cloudless sky.

Carer Miss Abbott’s daughter Laranca Cunningham, 17, took the photographs of the cloud - and she believes it was a festive message from her father Colin Abbott, who died 20 years ago.

Angel in the sky: The mother who spotted the cloud said she believed it was a message from her late father

The 40-year-old single mother from Boston, Lincolnshire, said the cloud hung in the sky for about 30 minutes while she was on the way to see sibling Georgina Barron in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. 

Miss Abbott said: ‘I just started sobbing. It was absolutely stunning. It was an angel, sent down for me, and nothing else. It was a sign to tell me everything was going to work out.

‘As I was driving, I quickly told Laranca to take a picture on her phone before it disappeared.’

Miss Abbott added that the image gave her hope, despite recently being told her son William Cunningham, 15, who has a connective tissue disorder, also has a serious heart condition.

She said: ‘When I saw the angel, I knew in an instant that Christmas was going to be all right, and that my son’s health would improve. It was truly a breathtaking and overwhelming experience.’

The angel Gabriel is one of the main characters of the Christmas Nativity story, telling Mary that she would give birth to the Son of God. Angels are mentioned about 300 times in the Bible.
