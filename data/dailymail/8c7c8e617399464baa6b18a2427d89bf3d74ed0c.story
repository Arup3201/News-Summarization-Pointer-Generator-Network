A leading Australian barrister whose wife was found buried upside down in a park grave was sensationally acquitted of her murder today.

Lloyd Rayney, 50, was found not guilty of killing his estranged wife, Corryn, 44, after she returned to their home in Perth from her weekly dance class in 2007.

During the three and a half month trial which has gripped the country, the Western Australian Supreme Court heard that Mrs Rayney, a former court registrar, had made threats to destroy her husband’s career and ‘take him to the cleaners’.

Freed: Speaking outside court Mr Rayney said it was 'a terrible tragedy' and  'We still don't know what happened to Corryn'

The defence did not dispute that the couple’s marriage was at a crisis point, but Mr Rayney denied any knowledge of what happened to his wife the night she disappeared.

He had reported her missing after he said she had failed to return from her regular American-style bootscooting class.

A week later her silver saloon car was found abandoned in a Perth beachside suburb.

Detectives followed a transmission fluid leak from the car to Kings Park, in the centre of Perth, where they followed a sandy track through thick scrub.

It was there that they discovered a 
grave with Mrs Rayney’s body buried in a diagonal position with the head
 in the lowest point.

Forensic experts said this positioning
 would have accelerated decomposition around the head and neck which, 
according to the prosecution, deliberately masked the cause of death.

A
 name tag from a board game called Celebrity Heads was found some 200 
yards from the grave. On one side it read ‘The Queen’, on the other 
‘Lloyd Rayney’.

Detectives carried out search warrants of the couple’s home and Lloyd Rayney’s phones were tapped.

Detective
 Senior Sergeant Jack Lee later named Mr Rayney as the ‘primary’ and 
‘only’ suspect but the defence team said the police had handled the 
investigation in a single-minded and biased way.

The defence lawyers even suggested that some evidence had been planted.

Mr
 Justice Brian Martin, QC - the judge who heard the sensational Peter 
Falconio case in the Northern Territory and sentenced Bradley Murdoch to
 28 years jail for the Briton’s murder - said at the end of the Rayney 
trial today that ‘I am not satisfied the accused killed the deceased.’

When Mr Rayney left the court there were chaotic scenes as he and his daughter were mobbed by the media. He said in a brief statement that it was concerning that the death of his wife remained unsolved.

Referring to his daughters, he said: ‘It’s been five years since Sarah and Caitlyn have been without their mum. They haven’t been treated well by many people, but apart from that they still don’t know and we still don’t know, what happened to Corryn.

‘That is a terrible tragedy.’

Judge Martin said the police evidence had failed to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt. He said he was satisfied Mrs Rayney had died in Kings Park and there was evidence suggesting the possibility of a sexually motivated attack.
