A Dallas mom facing kidnapping charges has given an interview from jail to try and 'clear the record', saying she did not abduct the two children but thought something was wrong and was trying to help.

Briana Blount was arrested Wednesday after one of her neighbors in McKinney saw her with two kids that were not her own, sensed something was wrong and called police.

The 23-year-old mother-of-one - who has a history of drug problems and admits to using meth - says she found the seven-year-old boy and his four-year-old sister unattended on New Year's Eve at the at the Garland Road Thrift Store.

She told CBS DFW she decided to take them to her apartment four miles away to call police.

'This is a misunderstanding': Dallas woman Briana Blount gives an interview from Lew Sterrett Justice Center, saying she did not kidnap two children but tried to help them, believing they had been abandoned

Scene: Blount said she found the two kids - aged seven and four - unnattended at the Garland Road Thrift Store in White Rock around 5.30pm on New Years Eve 

Safety: Blount said she took the two kids to his apartment complex four miles from the thrift store where her friends were in order to call police

Arrested: Blount has been charged with two counts of kidnapping and assaulting a peace officer and has other outstanding warrants for driving without insurance and without a valid license

'It doesn't look good, but those actions weren't based off of kidnapping,' she said.

'Those actions weren't based off of trying to hurt or trying to take somebody away from anything. 

'I legitimately thought something was wrong and I was trying to help.'

However the children's father was in the change room trying on clothes, only to come out and not be able to find his kids. 

An employee at the store told the father she saw a white woman leave with the children, who are black. 

Blount said she didn't call 911 from the store because she was alone and knew her friends were home at her apartment complex and wanted their help.

'I felt as if I needed to help these kids and keep them safe until I could get them in the hands of the police,' she told CBS.

However her neighbor, April Hobbs, saw the situation differently.

Mom: Blount has a young son named Aiden, who is currently with his father in Michigan

'Something in my chest said something wasn't right.'
