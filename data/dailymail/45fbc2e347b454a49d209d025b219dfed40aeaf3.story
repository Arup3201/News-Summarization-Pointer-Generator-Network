The remains of a top secret tiny submarine that could dive deeper than any other vessel and was used in the recovery of the doomed Challenger shuttle have been put on display.

The NR-1 sub performed Cold War operations so classified that its 10-man crews remain sworn to secrecy to this day.

It had a claw to pick objects off the sea bed - crucial in the days when Americans and Soviets were tapping underground cables - and even went in search of fragments from the Challenger space shuttle, which exploded during blast-off in 1986.

NR-1, pictured in 2007, was one of the U.S. Navy's most advanced and secretive submarines. It has since been broken up and parts have gone on display in Groton, Connecticut, where she was first launched in 1969

NR-1 launched in Groton, Connecticut, in 1969, where it stayed for much of its time until it left service in 2008.

The top-secret sub was dismantled - but the U.S. Navy has now collected pieces of it for an exhibition in its home port.

Veterans who served aboard the tiny sub during 
the Cold War say it was one of the most fascinating briefs of 
their careers - but not even their wives know all the details.

Toby Warson, commander 
from 1970 to 1973, won a distinguished service medal for a 'hazardous military operation' in the Mediterranean code-named Raccoon Hook.

Yet he is forbidden to this day from telling anyone - even officers - what he did to earn it.

Commander Tony Warson earned a distinguished service medal for his three years aboard the NR-1, pictured - but he is forbidden from telling fellow officers why. 'I wasn't being cute,' he said. 'I just didn't want to go to jail'

'I 
finally had to quit wearing the ribbon because when I walked into the 
officers' club, everyone asked how I got it, and I couldn't tell them,' said Warson, who lives in Camas, Washington state.

'They thought I was 
being cute. I wasn't being cute. I just didn't want to go to jail.

The custom-built, one-of-a-kind vessel carried no weapons, measured just 140ft and travelled at just four knots, but held ten men for up to a month at a time.

It was a pet project of Admiral Hyman Rickover, the 'father of the nuclear Navy', and contained a custom-built mini nuclear reactor which powered it as deep as 3,000 feet.

Once on the sea bed, it had wheels and lights to explore the ocean floor.

It was mainly a research sub, but also performed Cold War military missions which remain highly classified.

NR-1 missions which have been declassified include an undersea submarine-detection operation and mapping the ocean floor.

It was used in 1976 to recover an F-14 fighter which had rolled off the deck of an aircraft 
carrier with a newly-developed missile attached to it.

Former commander Michael Riegel said the sub's secrets are fascinating - but he has kept them to himself

Yet the slow-moving sub had to be towed to sea by a surface boat to save time, and it was so small that the crew could feel every pitch and roll of the current.

The long-suffering men also had to survive on frozen TV dinners, bath once a week with a bucket of 
water and burn chlorate candles to produce oxygen to breathe.Â 

Former commander Allison J Holifield said: 'Everybody on NR-1 got sick. It was only a matter of whether you were throwing up or not throwing up.'

Admiral Rickover - who bestowed NR-1 with a level of secrecy far above what was normal in the Cold War - wanted several of the submarines but was stopped by high costs.

Michael Riegel, a former commander at the Groton base who also served as an officer aboard NR-1 in the 1970s.

He was pictured five years ago with a model of the submarine, which was also a highlight of his career.

If NR-1's secrets were revealed, he said: 'Some will probably say "Gee, that wasn't out of the ordinary." Some will say "Gee, that was really slick what they did."

But if and when that will come is anyone's guess. For the former sailor, like everyone else, is staying tight-lipped about the U.S. Navy's greatest secrets.
