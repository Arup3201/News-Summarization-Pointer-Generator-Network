If you're thinking of giving this new photography craze a go, a head for heights is as essential as a camera.

Rooftopping is the heart-stopping photography movement which involves thrill seekers climbing to the top of city skyscrapers, hanging off the edge and taking pictures of the spectacular view beneath them.

Photographer Tom Ryaboi is one of the crusaders of Rooftopping. The 27-year-old, from Toronto in Canada, has climbed more than 100 buildings and produced some of the most stunning examples of the craze.

Head for heights: Thrillseeking photographer Tom Ryaboi took this shot from the roof of a skyscraper, high above the streets of Toronto

Above the world: The stunning photography shots produce amazing results but photographers have to go to extreme lengths to capture the images

He said: 'It's addictive and I am 
always looking for a higher roof in the city. But I still feel the buzz 
whenever I reach the top and feel the wind. It's a pure rush of 
adrenaline.'

Disguising themselves so they can 
carry out their daring stunts, the thrill seekers avoid security and 
CCTV before climbing to the top of skyscrapers and hanging off
 the edge - photographing the evidence as proof of their antics.

Tom added: 'I
 try to blend in as much as possible. In an office building I
 dress like I work there, on a construction site I dress like the 
workmen.

'It's in my blood. When I was a child one day, my dad came home from work and found me sitting on top of the fridge.

'They had no idea how I had got there, but obviously I just liked climbing things.'

Growing in popularity: Using the internet to spread his new found love of storming skyscraper roofs, Tom has now inspired other Rooftoppers to start climbing too

Birds eye view: Rooftoppers avoid security, CCTV and risk their lives on top of the windy ledges up to almost 1,000 feet high

Having
 spent the past four years on top of Canada's largest city's roofs, Tom 
enjoys the isolation he feels hundreds of feet above the pavement.

He added: 'I've
 been on the top three tallest buildings in Toronto. But I 
often tell people it's not really the height the matters.

'The coolest views are often from lower buildings nestled in between the tall ones.

'You really get a sense you're in the urban 'jungle' then, surrounded by this forest of concrete, steel and glass.

Using
 the internet to spread his new found love of storming skyscraper roofs,
 Tom has now inspired other rooftoppers to start climbing too.

'I'm
 not the first in the world, but I've introduced about 20 people to 
rooftopping and now groups of men and women are all trying to do it.'
