Tennessee Titans running back Shonn Greene was arrested Friday after parking in a handicap spot and leaving as a parking enforcement officer was writing him a citation, police said.

Greene had parked his BMW M6 in a reserved spot on the public square in Franklin, a Nashville suburb, and ignored an officer's requests to produce a handicap placard for the space.

According to WTSP, as the officer wrote out a citation, Greene got into his vehicle and sped off, almost hitting her car.

Failure to stop: Shonn Greene, Tennessee Titans running back, twice did not stop for a parking enforcement officer trying to issue a citation for parking in a handicapped spot

The officer followed the Titans player and when he stopped in traffic she attempted to hand the citation to Greene, who again ignored her, according to Franklin police Sgt Charles Warner.

Avoided: Franklin police said that Greene was facing a $51 citation before he sped off, almost striking the parking enforcement officer's vehicle

'This whole thing could have been avoided if Greene would have simply left that handicapped parking space available for whom it was intended,' said Warner.

'Even after getting caught illegally parking there, all he had to do was talk to the parking enforcement officer about the $51 citation she was writing him,' he added.

After the second attempt, Greene was charged with misdemeanors of driving on a suspended license, reckless driving, failure to stop/halt/frisk and illegal parking.

The player surrendered on Friday after learning there were multiple warrants out for his arrest.

He was released on $2,000 bail and will face a court appearance November 13. 

The Tennessee Titans released a statement on Saturday that the team had spoken with Greene about the incident.

'This is not the type of behavior we expect from any member of our organization,' the statement read. 'We will continue to gather additional information as it becomes available and handle the matter internally.'

Greene has spent the last two weeks nursing a hamstring injury, but his return for Sunday's game against the Houston Texans was 'probable' according to the team's injury report.

Running: Greene is currently second among Titans running backs, with 44 carries totaling 190 yards this season

The former New York Jets running back is second on the Titans in rushing this season, with 190 yards on 44 tries with one touchdown.
