The police are at the centre of a multi-million-pound expenses row after extraordinary spending binges on taxpayer-funded credit cards.

Officials working for a Government policing quango used the cards to buy items such as exotic lingerie and beehives while racking up bills of more than £3 million a year.

Last night the quango claimed the underwear had been used to re-enact crime scenes, while the bees were said to be necessary to fertilise an allotment at a staff training college.

But MPs dismissed the defence, calling the spending, revealed under a Freedom of Information request, ‘outrageous’ and demanding an investigation.

The row comes amid a battle between the Coalition and senior civil servants over the use of the 140,000 ‘procurement cards’ – credit cards embossed with the words HM Government – which have been issued to Whitehall officials and in town halls around the country.

Ministers were horrified to discover that despite more than £1 billion of public money being put on the cards every year, any spending lower than £1,000 a month has not been routinely audited.

And they have been infuriated by what they privately call ‘blocking tactics’ at the top of the Civil Service when they have tried to establish how many officials have been abusing the perk by using the cards to make personal purchases.

Just four out of the 25 Government departments have released details of internal investigations into the card use.

The disclosure of secret bank statements shows astonishing spending by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), a £368 million-a-year outfit set up three years ago by Labour ‘to support the police service by providing expertise in areas such as serious crime analysis and the development of new policing technologies and skills’.

A total of 150 of the policing organisation’s 1,636 staff have been issued with the procurement cards, using them to spend an average of more than £20,000 a year.

The card statements, which cover 2008 to 2010, detail hundreds of items which appear to be far removed from the world of crime detection.

They include: £51.60 on designer lingerie from Figleaves.com, which specialises in luxurious ‘intimate apparel’; £28.95 on women’s underwear from the ‘beautiful, sexy and stylish’ store La Senza; £1,841 on beehives; £205 on golfing equipment; and £1,258 on a lawnmower.

£1,289 went on sightseeing with London Duck Tours; £55 on karaoke gear; £828 on judo outfits – and 69p at sandwich shop Pret A Manger, believed to be on a packet of crisps.

Over the two years, the card holders billed the taxpayer for a total of £1,386,534 on travel, £672,588 on hotels, £26,779 on leisure, £27,917 on restaurants and bars, and £18,196 on ‘garden services’.

The statements show the NPIA’s total spending on the cards was £2,869,611 in 2008-2009, rising to £3,625,405 in 2009-2010.

Last night Tory MP Anna Soubry called for an investigation. ‘Now we know where all the money went under the last Labour Government,’ she said. ‘What on earth are they doing spending money on beehives and lingerie? It’s outrageous.’

Nick Gargan, chief executive of the NPIA – which will be phased out next year as part of the Government’s cull of quangos – admitted the bills could lead to a ‘perception of wastefulness’, but said all spending had been legitimate.

Mr Gargan, former Assistant Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police, said the lingerie had been bought to simulate a scene of sexual assault at Harperley Hall, the country retreat at Crook, County Durham, where police are trained in crime-scene investigation techniques.

He defended the purchase of beehives as necessary to help sustain a market garden at the police staff college at Bramshill, Hampshire, and said other items such as ‘golfing equipment’ had been used as part of first aid training exercises.

‘It is important to make the training as realistic as possible,’ said Mr Gargan. ‘But lessons are being learned. If we were buying lingerie as props today, I think we would probably walk into Primark to get them.

‘The beehives were bought to cultivate the kitchen garden which grows fruit and vegetables at the police staff college in Bramshill. It is better than flying in food from around the world. And you need bees to make a kitchen garden work.’

He said the lawnmower had been bought to help maintain the college’s gardens, the karaoke equipment had been used in the student lounge at Harperley Hall, and the Duck Tours had been laid on for international policing officers who attended training courses – with the costs met by the course fees, not the taxpayer.

Mr Gargan said: ‘We have significantly reduced the amount spent through the use of the procurement cards by 33 per cent, from £3.6  million in 2009-10 to £2.48  million in 2010-11.’

Ministers have been alarmed by the seemingly lax approach to auditing card use. The cards, introduced in 1997, the year Tony Blair entered Downing Street, were designed to be a convenient way to pay for low-value work expenses such as travel tickets and office supplies.

But unlike many company credit cards, which dock the sums spent from employees’ pay and refund it if the claim can be justified, the bills are settled directly by finance departments out of taxpayers’ funds.

Suspicions have been raised by the number of items on the bills that appear to cost just less than £1,000 – the minimum amount that was usually checked by finance directors. 

Labour set up the National Policing Improvement Agency in 2007, saying the quango would boost police expertise in serious crime analysis, training, operational support and developing new technologies and skills.

With a staff of 2,174 – now down to 1,636 – and a budget of £368million, it is funded by the Home Office, with a leadership drawn from the Police Service.

Since last year, it has been headed by former Thames Valley Assistant Chief Constable Nick Gargan.Ironically, given the revelations about officials’ credit card spending, the NPIA – which reports to the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and the Government – was given responsibility in 2009 for making ‘efficiency improvements’ to forces’ spending on goods and services.

Shortly after coming into power, the Coalition Government said it would shut the NPIA as part of its programme of public spending cuts, and hand its responsibilities to other organisations.

The move has been condemned by Labour.

Settling up: Most cards are black, but senior staff might have a gold or silver one

Over the 14 years since it was developed, the Government Procurement Card (GPC) has spread to every corner of officialdom.

Dubbed the ‘Gold Card on the taxpayer’, a total of 71,000 are used in Central London, with the remaining 69,000 issued by councils and quangos.

They are billed as a convenient way to pay for low-value work expenses such as travel tickets and office supplies, with all bills settled directly by departmental finance departments, but have instead been used far more widely.

A 20-page manual declares in bold type that: ‘Deliberate or negligent misuse of the GPC may result in the suspension or withdrawal of your card. Serious misuse could result in disciplinary or criminal action being taken against you.’

The manual explains that each card owner has a set ‘single transaction limit’ and monthly limit. Most cards are black, but card holders at the top of the Civil Service pecking order are issued with silver or gold cards that ‘do not have the single transaction or categories of spend constraints that the black cards have . . . and the full monthly credit limit may therefore be used in one transaction if required’.

The rules say the cards can be used ‘for official business purposes only’. They cannot be used for obtaining cash, alcohol or fuel.

Attempts to discover how many officials have been disciplined for breaking these rules have met with resistance from the Civil Service.

Just four departments, the Treasury, Business, Health and Education, have disclosed their figures, which showed 22 incidents had been uncovered, of which eight led to the dismissal of a member of staff. The offences included using cards at Tesco and PC World.

The cards were supplied by Visa before other companies, including American Express and Mastercard, pitched for the contracts.

Last night, Visa said the Government could do more to regulate the cards’ use.

‘Departments have the ability to set controls on point-of-sale transactions to enable them to limit the type of merchants where money is spent,’ a spokesman said. ‘All transactions are transparent and information can be accessed by those in charge of monitoring expenditure.’
