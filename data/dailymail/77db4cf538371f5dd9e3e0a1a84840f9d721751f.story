Climbing the Himalayas is widely considered to be one of the toughest tests of a mountaineer's strength and endurance.

But these incredible photographs prove that coming down the mountains isn't for the faint-hearted either.

These dramatic views await anyone brave enough to travel on what has been described as the world's 'most extreme' zip-slide.

Not for the faint-hearted: Two visitors with nerves of steel take on the ZipFlyer Nepal

Adrenaline rush: The slide has a vertical drop of almost 2,000 feet and covers a distance of 1.8 kilometres

The ZipFlyer Nepal takes thrill-seekers over dense forest at speeds of up to 100mph from a platform overlooking the Himalayas.

The slide, built at Sarangkot, near the Nepalese city of Pokhara, has a vertical drop of almost 2,000 feet and covers a distance of 1.8 kilometres.

With an incline measured at a sheer 56 per cent, it is one of the tallest and steepest zip-slides in the world, according to operators High Ground Adventures.

The company describes the experience on its website, warning that speeds can reach 100mph.

'As you look down,' it states, 'the adrenaline begins to build up and your heart begins to beat faster.

'The countdown begins…5,4,3,2,1, and you’re airborne.

'Gravity takes care of the "go" portion of the ride, a feeling of weightlessness sets in, the wind gushes against your face, as you plunge at speeds of over 160kmph.

'After a minute of pure adrenaline, and travelling a distance of almost 2km, the ride begins to slow down as you approach the landing.
