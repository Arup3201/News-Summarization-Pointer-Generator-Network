The parents of a missing student whose car was found abandoned on the shore of a lake have said they are 'heartbroken'.

Max Maisel has been missing since 8pm on Sunday night and was last seen leaving his vehicle near Lake Ontario, New York.

The 21-year-old is the son of senior ESPN writer Ivan Maisel, 55, and Meg Murray. 

The family, from Fairfield, Connecticut, have owned a five-bedroom vacation house near the area he went missing since 1999.  

They described Max, a third-year photography student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), as 'very comfortable' there. 

A statement released by his parents said: 'We are heartbroken. At this point we still have more questions than answers. 

'We are asking for the public, including the RIT college community, to help us as we continue our search for Max and try to reconstruct where he has been and when. 

'Max was a photographer and was last seen in the vicinity of Charlotte Beach, an area that he had visited for many years. He felt very comfortable there.'  

Max is six feet, five inches tall and weighs about 135 pounds. 

His housemate Richard Otte saw Max leave their apartment late Sunday night and said he regrets not asking him where he was going as he thought it was odd.

Mr Maisel tried to contact his son on Sunday but could not get hold of him. He said, however, that this was not uncommon and he was not concerned, New York Daily News reports.

Max was last seen by a member of the public at Charlotte Pier. When he did not return to his car, a bronze 2004 Acura SUV, the passerby called the police.

He does not have his camera or phone with him. 

'The pier area was just something that was a part of his life,' Mr Maisel told the Democrat and Chronicle. 

'It's not a surprise at all to know he was there.' 

His sisters - Sarah, 23, and Elizabeth, 17 - are also helping with the search. 

'We love him. We miss him and we want him to come home. We can't wait for him to come home,' his mother said.

His parents made the 370-mile drive from Fairfield, Connecticut, on Tuesday morning to help police with the search at Charlotte Pier (above)

His parents also thanked the authorities that have helped so far.

Mr Maisel wrote on Twitter yesterday: 'We are so very gratified for the support we have received.' 

Their statement added: 'We would like to thank the law enforcement personnel from the City of Rochester and the RIT who have worked with us in the search for Max.

'We know they are doing everything they can to locate Max.' 

Rochester NY Police said there is no indication of foul play and will try to search the water when the weather improves. 

The force wrote on Twitter: 'RPD and RIT's Public Safety Department are attempting to locate Max Maisel. Please call 911 if you see Max.' 

Rochester NY Police said there is no indication of foul play and will try to search the rough water next
