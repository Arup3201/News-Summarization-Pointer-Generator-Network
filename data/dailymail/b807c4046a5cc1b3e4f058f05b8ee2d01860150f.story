Singer Miley Cyrus has been named as the new face of MAC Cosmetics' Viva Glam campaign.

The 21-year-old joins the likes of Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj who have all previously lent their support to the charitable beauty campaign.

Miley took to Twitter earlier today to confirm the news and revealed that make-up lovers can look forward to the official launch of her Viva Glam lip product duo - a bright pink lipstick and shimmery lip gloss - early in the New Year.

'Look out for my lipstick': Miley took to Twitter to confirm that she is the new face of MAC's campaign

Alongside a picture from her new campaign, the Wrecking Ball singer tweeted: 'Going #VIVAGLAM with @MACcosmetics. Look for my lipstick in early 2015.'

Renowned for her love of bold and bright colours, costumes and make-up, Miley has clearly taken inspiration from her own sense of style in order to create her lip products.  

Both of the hot pink products - an 'amplified' formula lipstick, which will be on sale for $16, and the shimmery lip glass, $15 - bear her seal of approval, her signature, which features clearly on the limited edition packaging.

As part of MAC's ongoing Viva Glam charity campaign, all profits from the sale of Miley's products will be donated to the MAC AIDS Fund, a charity started by MAC founders Frank Angelo and Frank Toskan in 1994. 

The charity, which celebrated its tenth anniversary earlier this year, is dedicated to 'helping men, women and children living with and affected by HIV/AIDS'.

The brand called upon the services of world-famous drag queen RuPaul to front the first ever campaign and - in addition to Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj and Miley - have since collaborated with a number of famous faces such as Elton John, Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Sharing the success: Miley follows in the footsteps of Rihanna, who released her latest Viva Glam products in September

'The idea of Viva Glam was to celebrate life and the outspoken attitude of the company,' a spokesperson for the brand wrote on its website.

'It was a connective tissue that encompassed the diversity of MAC and its mantra... all ages, all races, all sexes. It was, and continues to be, the signature and the heart and soul of the company. 

'Viva Glam spokespeople are provocative, alternative and influential and reflect diverse communities. They are heroes we look up to for their personal triumphs; people who have invented themselves and people who created movements.'
