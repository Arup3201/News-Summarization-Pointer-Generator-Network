Seeking justice: The parents of 19-year-old Megan Helal are suing Sigma Chi fraternity, as well as bartenders and fraternity members in her 2010 death

The parents of a 19-year-old college student who died after a night of heavy drinking at a fraternity party are suing the Greek organisation, as well as the bar where their teenage daughter was allegedly served drink after drink.

Megan Helal, who was a student at Navarro College, was attending a Sigma Chi fraternity party with her boyfriend at Baylor University in 2010.

She was said to have consumed between 10 to 17 vodka drinks within two hours, despite being underage and visibly drunk.

Her heart stopped the next morning, and she died from arrhythmia, according to the autopsy report.

Though the autopsy says she died of 
natural causes, the family's attorney seeks to prove that alcohol was to
blame for her sudden passing.

The family is filing the lawsuit a mere two days before the statute expires.

Ms
Helal’s parents are suing both Sigma Chi’s national headquarters and 
the now-defunct Sigma Chi chapter at Baylor, as well as the fraternity’s
risk management foundation, and the bar where the fraternity’s party 
was held.

The party, according to lawsuit, was supposedly in honour of the fraternity's newest recruits.

Party location: Ms Helal attended the Sigma Chi party at Mynar's Bar in West, Texas

The Baylor University chapter was suspended after the incident.

The lawsuit also alleges that Ms Helal’s Sigma Chi boyfriend and the owners and employees of the bar are responsible.

During the party in March 2010, the family alleges that their daughter was continuously served vodka at Mynar Bar in West, Texas, despite the fact that she was underage and that she appeared visibly drunk.

‘Clearly, the bar didn’t monitor what was going on inside,’ Linda Turley, the family’s attorney, said.

‘They didn’t know who the liquor was being served to. They just kept track of how much they served.’

Cause of death: Though her autopsy cites she died from a natural heart condition, her family's attorney seeks to prove she died as a result of too much alcohol

Tragic: Ms Helal was taken to Hillcrest Hospital, where she later died

She added: ‘In addition, they allowed the fraternity to set up bottle service in a little room where the drinking was going on.’

Though Ms Helal’s autopsy revealed that she died of cardiac arrhythmia because of myocardial fibrosis, and alcohol was out ruled, her parents still believe there's more to the story.

Arrest warrants were originally 
issued for Mynar Bar’s owner – 66-yearold Linda McWilliams, as well as 
the two bartenders – Amy Free, 35, and Carol Baker, 45 after Ms Helal's 
death.

Ms Helal played 
volleyball for her college and was considering becoming a physical 
therapist. She was described as a talented athlete.

The lawsuit does not designate a specific amount of damages sought.

Visiting: Ms Helal was visiting her boyfriend at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He was a member of the school's Sigma Chi fraternity

The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission confirmed in 2010 that alcohol was purchased from Mynars on a pre-paid tab.

Their initial investigation also revealed that five parties were involved – though 11 parties are listed in the lawsuit.

The national Sigma Chi headquarters told MailOnline that as of early Tuesday, they had no official comment on the case. 

According to kxtv.com, one of the Mynars bar owners was surprised to hear of the lawsuit as well.
