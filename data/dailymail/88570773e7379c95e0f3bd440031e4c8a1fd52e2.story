To the haunting refrains of Amazing Grace, 150 strangers on Thursday attended the funeral of a seven-month-old girl who died of starvation in a basement that resembled a 'dungeon' in January.

Police, firefighters and members of the public who never knew little May Edwards arrived at St. Anne Catholic Church in Barrington, Chicago, to mourn the baby and released a solitary balloon at the cemetery as she was buried.

The turnout of so many was in part sparked by the shock and horror in the community after the death of Mya - after her parents allegedly allowed her to starve to death because they couldn't afford food for her.

'It was great for me to be able to do,' said Detective Lori Allsteadt to The Daily Herald after releasing the balloon.

'It kind of was like the release on this whole thing.'

Deacon Jim Pauwels, gave a eulogy in which he asked those present not to think of their anger at the child's passing but to mourn her.

'When we're confronted with a case of innocence suffering, a case of death coming where there should have been life and growth and promise, it's not possible to not react,' Pauwels said to The Daily Herald.

Touching: The ceremony and burial were organized by a non-profit organization and attended by community members and the police and fire officials who were among the first to see Mya after she died

Grief: Joaquin Edwards, uncle of 7-month-old Mya Edwards, who starved to death in January, is consoled at the grave site by the Rev. Bernie Pietrzak, from St. Anne Catholic Church

Mya's parents, Gene Edwards, 22, and Markisa Jones, 19, have pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment stemming from the girl's death after they stopped feeding her and her twin sister Mia formula.

They instead gave their children meals of water, cereal and baby food, which wasn't enough to sustain the seven-month Mya.

Jones and Edwards were initially arrested January 8 after paramedics called to their home found their seven month-old daughter Mya dead on the dining room table.

The negligent parents called 911 that evening because the emaciated baby was not breathing, officials said. Both Mya and her twin were observed to be ‘very skinny.’

Further probing found that the pair kept both toddlers in the same crib locked in ‘an unfinished basement that resembled a dungeon,’ Assistant State’s Attorney Alyssa Grissom told the paper.

Mya was found to have died of malnutrition as a result of starvation, authorities said.

The couple were each charged with involuntary manslaughter, felony child endangerment and had their bails set at $250,000 a piece.

At the funeral was Mya's uncle, Joaquin Edwards.

He said he was 'grateful' for the service but wished his family was involved.

'I feel very pleased and at ease to know that she is buried,' Edwards said to The Daily Herald.

One firefighter, Chris Alioto, played the bagpipes during the burial, giving an emotional rendition of Amazing Grace.

Detective Sgt. Kevin Croke, who is leading the investigation, said the funeral was necessary.

'It's not common you get this kind of closure in this kind of case,' he said.
