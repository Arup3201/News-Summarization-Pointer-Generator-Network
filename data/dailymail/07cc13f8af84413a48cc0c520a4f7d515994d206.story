Kate Hudson, 22, was in Europe on the trip of a lifetime. 

She was mid-way through a journalism degree, and had worked hard as a retail assistant for two years to save enough money to head off on a grand adventure with girlfriends.

Kate was enjoying the high life of a tourist- exercising, jumping off cliffs, riding bikes, drinking alcohol and eating anything she wanted. She travelled through London, Paris, Croatia, Prague and Barcelona.

Seven weeks into her trip, she started noticing that her body was acting differently. She took a pregnancy test, and she was shocked to discover it was positive.

'I had absolutely no real clear symptoms. I was still getting regular periods. I wasn’t nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain, so it seemed silly to think I would be pregnant,' Kate said 

Travelling alone and in Barcelona, Kate immediately called her boyfriend of 18 months, Aaron, in a fluster. 

'I immediately rang and told Aaron, and although he was shocked, he was supportive and said that we could work around it, and if not, that we'd have months to prepare for having a baby,' Kate told Daily Mail Australia.

He calmed her down and told her to head to a doctor to double check. 

While she was reasonably anxious, Kate comforted herself with the thought that if by some small chance she was pregnant, she couldn't be more than a month or two along.

'I had absolutely no real clear symptoms. I was still getting regular periods. I wasn’t nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain, so it seemed silly to think I would be pregnant,' Kate told The Young Mummy. 

The doctor had some different news to share with her. Not only was Kate definitely pregnant, but she was 33 weeks pregnant and well into her third trimester. 

'I totally freaked out. I thought she said 13 weeks – not 33!' Kate said.

'I rang mum and she was so shocked. We could get over the fact that I was pregnant, but the fact I was told that I was 33 weeks was so hard to comprehend.'

'No way was I ready to have a baby. I’m only 22. No job, and no money. And no time to prepare.' 

'It was so hard being away from Aaron and we really struggled being away from each other.' 

By this time, she was in Prague. Dealing with doctors in a foreign country all alone, she knew she had to get home. 

This was easier said than done, as airlines require a certificate of permission for women travelling when they are in their third trimester. The obstetrician she visited in Prague said that she would have to give birth to the baby in Europe.

However Kate, a size 6 even at 33 weeks and showing no sign of a baby bump, decided to risk it and fly home the very next day.

'The baby was coming and coming fast, so I just had to prepare and get back home,' Kate said.

'When I called my mum, she said that's it, we're getting you home.'

It was on that flight home that Kate felt the baby kick inside her for the first time, and realised that the situation she was in was very real.

When Kate arrived back in Australia, her mum took her for a further examination to find out details she wasn't given overseas.

It was at this appointment that Kate was given even more shocking news. She wasn't 33 weeks pregnant, but 38 weeks, almost full term.

'I was scared because I didn’t know if the baby was healthy,' Kate said. 

'I was also scared about the future. Being a mum is daunting. I had no money since I had just came back from overseas. Where will we live, how will we pay for stuff? I didn’t know all too much about babies.'

Kate was told by the doctor that she had a tilted-back uterus, which explained why she didn't look like she was pregnant. 

She was still shocked that she had experienced no symptoms, and couldn't understand how it had happened to her.

'Any belly I had I thought was just a food baby from all the eating I’d done in Europe over two months.'

'I had thought about kids, and Aaron and I had spoken about it, but we we’re thinking it would be in a few years time… another 3-5 years time.'

Kate said she and Aaron were reluctant to tell people about being pregnant, scared that they would be criticised for not picking up on the pregnancy sooner.

'I had thought about kids, and Aaron and I had spoken about it, but we we’re thinking it would be in a few years time… another 3-5 years time,' Kate said

'When he came out it was surreal, and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says. It's then that you realise that you've made this beautiful human being,' Kate said

However, Kate said that people were overwhelmingly supportive and excited, though everyone was shocked.

'I was scared to post on social media about him because I didn’t want to be judged,' she said.

'In the back of my mind I was scared of how people were going to react. I thought they'd be like, oh Kate, you were in Europe two seconds ago.'

Kate said she was concerned people might think that she was trying to hide that she was pregnant.

'It was overwhelming trying to explain it to people, and I still haven't told the full story to everyone because it's such a long process. 

'People just couldn't believe it, it's a pretty interesting story.' 

Kate's friends and family all pitched in and helped her and Aaron buy all the essentials, making sure they had all the material necessities to look after their baby- who they found out during a scan was a boy.

'That's when we started getting excited, ' she said. 

There was still one more surprise in store for Kate. When she had further testing the doctors gave her the news that she wasn't 38 weeks pregnant- Kate's baby was actually overdue and had to be induced immediately.

Little Mason arrived after a relatively straightforward birth, weighing 6.5 pounds, which Kate said was easier than she had been expecting.

'He slipped out in the end,' she laughed. 

'When he came out it was surreal, and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says. It's then that you realise that you've made this beautiful human being.'

'Mason’s here and I’m going to try to be the best parent I can be for him,' Kate said

'It's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect. We're definitely happy and wouldn't change it for the world, knowing what we do now,' Kate said

'Aaron and I looked at each other, we were amazed. Even after two weeks we were still quite shocked and getting used to the fact were parents.' 

The 22-year-old went from being an independent young woman travelling the globe, to a first-time mum in only a week and a half, which she still finds hard to process. 

'I'm so very lucky to have the support of my friends and family. It's been a huge adjustment to realise that I have a child, but Mason is such a good and calm baby.'

Kate and her partner Aaron are now living with Kate's parents and have started thinking about what the future will hold for their family. 

'Thinking about the future is scary,' said Kate.

'I need to figure out what's best. Should I work or go to back to university? We want to move out and need to be thinking about money.'

Kate said that she is now having to consider things she never anticipated having to think about, even six months ago.  

'At 22 you wouldn't think you’d be going off to buy a house, or thinking about what school districts are the best,'

'We've had to start thinking about what to expect in years to come instead of thinking in the short term.' 

The young mum said that she is learning to just roll with her new role and to make the most of her life with Mason.

'I have a beautiful healthy baby boy, my relationship with Aaron is stronger than ever, although it’s more work than it’s ever been, trying to find ‘us time’, so I can’t complain too much,' Kate told The Young Mummy.

Mason is growing well, and is now rolling on his stomach and loves giggling, said Kate. 

'I’ve just gotta’ roll with it and make the most of it.'

It's been a long, but surprisingly quick journey to motherhood for Kate, who said that people are still shocked when she tells them the story.

'Even now when I tell people they are like ‘how?' 

For now, Kate said she is loving being a mother to her 'little miracle' Mason, and while she is still coming to terms with her new life, she is determined to be there for him no matter what.

'Mason’s here and I’m going to try to be the best parent I can be for him.' 

Kate said that she is so happy with the way her life has turned out, even though it was unexpected.

'It's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect. We're definitely happy and wouldn't change it for the world, knowing what we do now.'
