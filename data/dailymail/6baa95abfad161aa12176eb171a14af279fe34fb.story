Nearly 50 police commandos have been slaughtered in the Philippines by Muslim rebels who claim they entered their territory without agreeing to it first.

An 11 hour gun-battle broke out after police entered the remote town of Mamasapano, held by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the early hours of Sunday without liaising with the rebels as required under a ceasefire agreement.

Police say that the bodies of 49 officers have been removed from the town on Mindano island and moved to an army camp.

Commandos clashed with Muslim rebels and an 11 hour gun battle broke out in the remote town of Mamasapano in the Philippines 

It is not known whether any MILF members were killed in the attack, which came as police had been targeting two high-profile terror suspects in the operation.

Philippine national police chief Leonardo Espina and interior and local government secretary Manuel Roxas flew to Maguindanao today.

In a statement Mr Espina said the police commandos were chasing a 'high-value target' believed to be behind recent bomb attacks in the south but he did not elaborate.

Meanwhile the MILF's chief peace negotiator Mohagher Iqbal revealed authorities were trying to arrest a member of regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah called Zulkifli bin Hir, who is on the United States' most wanted list with a $5million bounty on his head.

Malaysian bomb-maker Zulkifli is the most prominent of the 10 to 12 foreign JI members believed hiding in the Philippines.

He went into hiding in the southern region in 2003 and has since been training local militants, according to the military.

Authorities were also allegedly targeting Basit Usman, commander of the BIFF Philippine Muslim rebel faction that is not part of peace talks.

The firefight in Mamasapano was only the second since the ceasefire when two soldiers and 18 Muslim gunmen were killed in a clash on the southern island of Basilan in April 2014

The 10,000-member MILF had recently agreed to end decades of rebellion in the mainly Catholic nation in exchange for a proposed law now being debated in parliament that would give minority Muslims self-rule in several southern provinces.

The rebels were scheduled to start disarming at the start of this year under the peace treaty.

Mr Iqbal said: 'This is the first encounter between the MILF and (government forces) this year. Hopefully, this will be the last.

'We are committed (to the peace process). For the MILF, the ceasefire still holds.'

The rebel group's vice chairman, Ghazali Jaafar, also said the peace treaty signed last March was the only solution to the conflict.

The firefight in Mamasapano was only the second since the ceasefire when two soldiers and 18 Muslim gunmen were killed in a clash on the southern island of Basilan in April 2014.

The Muslim rebellion in Mindanao had claimed tens of thousands of lives over several decades.

Since the peace deal was struck, troops and police have been pursuing the BIFF, a group of several hundred Muslim gunmen who reject the peace treaty.

Last year the BIFF pledged allegiance to Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria.
