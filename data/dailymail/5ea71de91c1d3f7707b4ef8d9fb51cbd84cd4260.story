Former Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has spoken of her fears that she would die after a 'pimple' on  her nose turned out to be a skin cancer.

She has also described the agony she was in after surgery to remove the growth - and her fears that she would be left disfigured forever.

Since the cancer was removed, she has also undergone reconstructive surgery.

Worrying: Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry feared she would die after a persistent red mark on her nose was finally diagnosed as skin cancer

In January, the 34-year-old businesswoman announced she had been diagnosed with Basal Cell Carcinoma, the same condition Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman was diagnosed with late last year.

Michelle told The Sunday Mirror: 'When I heard the "C" word I crumbled. It was really harrowing, I thought I was going to die.'

Michelle had been worried about a 'persistent pimple' on her face, despite being told by staff at an NHS walk-centre more than a year before it was nothing to worry about.

It was only when she met a plastic surgeon at a Christmas party - who said it looked serious - that she pushed for a biopsy - which revealed the horrifying truth.

Within a fortnight, she had undergone emergency surgery to remove the tumour. As well as being in excruciating pain, she was left with a centimetre-deep crater on the left side of her nose, according to The Sunday Mirror.

This has recently been treated by taking skin from her cheek to fill in the hole.

She told the newspaper: 'I can’t even explain to you how much pain I was in after the op – I couldn’t eat or sleep because it hurt so much.

She added: 'But
 I also worried over what it meant for me and the rest of my life. I 
felt so ugly. I had a hole cut out of my face and I was so 
self-conscious about it I didn’t even want to leave the house.'

Terrified: 'When I heard the "C" word I crumbled. It was really harrowing, I thought I was going to die,' Michelle said

Speaking about her traumatic experience, the Sky Sunrise regular said she had feared for her life.

She added that she was angry her concerns about her 'pimple' had been dismissed as nothing to worry about.

Speaking about finally getting a diagnosis, the website entreprenuer urged fans to get checked if in doubt about their health, as she warned the condition can be extremely 'destructive' if it goes without being treated.

She told MailOnline: 'I wanted to share this because it was a spot on my face, not a mole. It's a common misconception that it's moles that cause this.

'I had the pimple for a year and a half 
before it was wrongly diagnosed at an NHS walk-in centre. If you have 
something, go and get it checked out. 

'I always said I was too busy but 
thankfully for me, it's very easy to get it sorted. If it had gone 
unchecked, then who knows what might have happened. It's better to be 
safe than sorry. The condition is localised but destructive if goes 
unchecked.'

Basal cell carcinoma account for about 75 per cent of skin cancers. The exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be linked to overexposure to UV light.

The condition affects about 100,000 new patients in the UK every year. The chance of developing the cancer 
is higher in people with a family history of the condition, in people 
with pale skin and in those with lots of freckles.

In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm while cancerous patches are flat and scaly.

It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5 per cent of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma - another type of skin cancer - which spreads to other parts of the body in about 4 per cent of cases.

Treatment for basal cell carcinoma is completely successful in approximately 90 per cent of cases.

Michelle
 has always been safe in the sun, wearing factor 30 sun lotion on a 
daily basis, and not even going abroad until she was 18.

Under the knife: Michelle has now had reconstructive surgery to cover the hole in her nose, using skin from her cheek

Hull-based Michelle won the second series of The Apprentice back in 2006, beating fellow finalist Ruth Badger to bag a lucrative job with technology mogul, Lord Alan Sugar.

Following her victory on the BBC business-based reality show, Michelle was awarded a position within Lord Sugar's AMSTRAD company, aiding the launch of Xenon Green, a new venture which specialised in computer equipment disposal.

After working for the multi-millionaire for 11 months, Michelle left Lord Sugar's employment to set up her own consultancy firm and assist on government initiatives supporting aspiring young entrepreneurs.

The businesswoman now presents a weekly programme on Sky Sunrise alongside presenter Eamonn Holmes, as well as running a social buying website.
