A police officer who pulled over a shoplifter decided to help the alleged criminal - after he saw he was a single father trying to feed his six-month-old son.

Justin Roby, a detective at London Police Department in Kentucky, was called to an incident at a supermarket on Saturday January 17, but refused to detain the man.

Instead he bought him the formula he needed - and let him walk free.

Kind: Justin Roby, a detective at London Police Department in Kentucky, bought a shoplifter baby formula

'Me citing him for court wouldn't have done any good for him,' Roby told WKYT.

'He's already short on money, can't afford formula, so me making him appear in court, he's still not going to have any food for that baby.'

'As a police officer, it's not black and white for us,' said Officer Justin Roby. 

'There's a lot of gray. And you have to cipher through everything and you really need to figure out the whole story.'

'You put yourself in the situations,' he said. 

'Not black and white': Roby insists police officers have to show discretion in some situations to help people

'I think, "Well, what if me and my son, what if this was us?"

'I think when [a lot of people] look at us, they see just the uniform and just the car, just the tools that we have on our belt,' Roby said. 

'But behind the uniform, I'm a human being and I'm a person out in this community just like any of them. I have a little boy. I'm a father just like that gentleman was.

'We're not these robots,' he said. 'There's a human behind the badge.'
