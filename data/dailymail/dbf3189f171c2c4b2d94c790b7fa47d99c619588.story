An overweight woman was spurred into losing four stone after she found a text on her boyfriend's phone describing her as an 'embarrassment'.

Amy Jones, from Winsford, Cheshire, had no idea that her partner felt that way and the text was such a shock that she decided to make a positive change.

Before finding the message, the 21-year-old says her boyfriend had always been supportive of her as her weight spiralled to more than 15 stone after they set up home together.

Another turning point came for Amy when this picture was taken of her at her father's wedding, she cried when she saw the picture saying she looked almost as big as the tractor

Then one day she discovered his true feelings - expressed in a text message to a mutual friend.

'She is massive - she is an embarrassment,' said the message which inspired Amy to go a body blitz which has seen her lose four-and-a-half stone, going down to 10st 11lb.

She went down from a size 18 to a shapely size 10 and lost 38cm of fat from her body.

Amy, 21, says that although they had their fall-outs she had never suspected that her weight would be an issue. 

'It had always been a pretty volatile relationship and we did argue a lot. But my boyfriend was always very supportive when it came to my weight.'

Amy was horrified when she found the text to a mutual friend that read: 'She is massive - she is an embarrassment' spurring her on to make a huge change to her lifestyle 

Amy added that he would even compliment her on her size and discouraged her from losing weight. 

'He always said that I looked fantastic and he liked me with a fuller figure when I asked him if I should lose weight.

'I was reassured by his comments even though I knew that I was getting out of shape.

'The reason why I had got so much fatter was because I had moved in with him.

'He was a body builder who was down the gym all the time.

After switching her diet Amy lost almost a quarter of her body weight in less than a year 

'I would basically eat the same meals as him and then not go down the gym.'

Amy's weight shot up until it reached 15st 4lb when she attended her dad Martin's wedding in Swindon last year.

She was pictured standing in front of a tractor looking larger than she had ever been.

When she saw the picture in the weeks after the wedding, she realised she badly need to turn things around.

After discovering her boyfriend's text Amy split up with him but the pair have remained friends 

Amy said: 'I cried when I saw the picture - I was so badly out of shape, almost as big as the tractor!

'I had always been curvy but what was worrying was how much weight I was showing on my legs.

'I thought, "This is not me - this is not who I want to be."

Then she discovered that hurtful text message and this was the final push she needed to turn her life around. 

But before she could think about losing any weight Amy knew the first thing she needed to do was to split with her boyfriend.

She said: 'The text message was the final straw but things had been rocky before then. We split up but actually stayed friends afterwards.

'I don't harbour any grudge about the text message. He was only telling the truth. I just wish that he had been a bit more honest with me beforehand because I might not have got into such bad shape.'

Amy was also advised by her mother Clare, 42, that she needed to lose weight.

She said: 'Mum was being cruel to be kind. She told the truth as well and said I needed to change things fast.'

Amy, who works as a PA, cut down her calories by no longer sharing calorie-laden meals with her body building ex.

She stopped some of her dieting bad habits - notably eating a packet of crisps and a bar of Galaxy from the vending machine at work.

Walkers Cheese & Onion Crisps, Galaxy bars, pasta, bread, vodka and Red Bull

Butternut squash soup, grilled chicken with vegetables, dried coconut snacks, Diet Coke.

Amy also began to take a dietary supplement, Forza Raspberry K2s,  to curb her appetite and give her more energy. 

Amy says that once she began to shed the pounds she was inspired to continue losing almost a quarter of her body weight in less than a year.

'The weight just fell off me and I lost more four-and-a-half stone in less than six months. I am now down to just under 10-stone and a size 10.

'I am not going to stop here, though. I would like to get down to a size 8.'
