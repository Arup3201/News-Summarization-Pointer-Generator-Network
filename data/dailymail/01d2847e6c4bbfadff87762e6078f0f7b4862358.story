At Dolce & Gabbana's Milan Fashion Week show this afternoon, it wasn't just the clothes that turned heads on the catwalk.

In a tribute to mothers and motherhood, each model carried a baby down the runway, with some expertly holding their precious cargo and others struggling to come to grips with the little ones.

The backdrop, a white panel adorned with a red rose and the word 'mamma' in script, completed the theme of the show, which was fittingly called 'Viva la Mamma'.

At Dolce & Gabbana's Milan Fashion Week show this afternoon, models walked the catwalk while carrying babies in a tribute to motherhood

The tiny fashionistas, who were all decked out in lace dresses and mini suits, ranged in age from just a few months to a few years old.

While most of the babies were apparently unrelated to the models, pregnant supermodel Bianca Balti, 30, showcased her very own baby bump on the runway, looking positively glowing in a powder pink sheath dress and black heels.

According to guests, the youngsters on the runway were extremely well-behaved, but a few pictures from the show tell something of a different story.

In one image, for instance, a model clad in a black and red floral ensemble smiles brightly as she carries her adorable accessory - but the baby looks thoroughly nonplussed.

Another shot sees a model carrying her baby so that she faces forward, toward the audience, a position that does not seem to sit well with the blue-eyed little girl.

Even the designs were in keeping with the theme, with evening gowns embroidered with children's doodles and other designs emblazoned with the words 'Je t'aime maman' and 'Mamma'.

Mothering day isn't officially celebrated in Italy until May, a full two months after the UK's version of the holiday, but it clearly played an important part in the tone of the show.

Also on the runway was supermodel Karlie Kloss, who cut an elegant figure in a black velvet dress featuring a beautiful red rose print cut just below the knee and worn with red satin shoes.

The 22-year-old's hair was coiffed in a simple up-do, with a slick of burgundy lipstick setting off the look.

Karlie recently announced her decision to hang up her Victoria's Secret Angel wings in order to attend NYU's Gallatin School of Individualised Studies. 

She said to Style.com of the big move: 'I have a lot of exciting things coming up and you can't be everywhere.'
