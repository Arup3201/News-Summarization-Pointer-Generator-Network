Ed Miliband came face-to-face with his image problems yesterday – as he was presented with cartoons portraying him as Wallace from the children’s animation films.

The Labour leader dismissed suggestions that he has become a figure of fun in the eyes of voters.

But as he laughed off comparisons with the film character on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show, it emerged that he is worried enough about his poor public image to have sought help from a world renowned expert on autism. Mr Miliband has also employed a voice coach.

It was autism expert Simon Baron-Cohen who apparently advised the Labour leader to make a virtue of his political ‘empathy’ – a word he used seven times in a speech last Friday.

Awkward: Labour leader Ed Miliband has tried to play down the importance of image, but was handed cartoons mocking his image by the BBC's Andrew Marr

The newspaper cartoons have cemented in the minds of some voters the idea that Mr Miliband is not up to the job of being Prime Minister

Mr Baron-Cohen, a Cambridge academic and cousin of Ali G creator Sacha Baron Cohen, is the author of Zero Degrees Of Empathy, a book which examines how political leaders need empathy to help them resolve conflicts.

He said he has had several conversations with Mr Miliband over the past year. Empathy was about ‘being a good listener’ and being able to take in to account ‘different perspectives’. Mr Baron-Cohen was given an advance copy of Friday’s speech.

‘His office contacted me this time last summer. They asked me if I’d meet him because Ed had read my book. He invited me to talk to him about the politics of empathy,’ he told The Sunday Times. 

‘I talked to him about the relevance of empathy to a party leader and potential future prime minister. He has invited me to various events over the past year. He’s now starting to use the word empathy. 

'It may be that he’s trying to position himself as a different kind of leader. It’s about being a good listener and taking into account diverse perspectives.’

Mr Miliband has hired professional voice coach Paul Jamieson to improve how he speaks, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Mr Jamieson, a theatre producer, claims to ‘unblock’ his clients and ‘harness their physical leadership’.

Members of the public should be brought into the House of Commons to grill the Prime Minister once a week, Ed Miliband said yesterday.

He said he wanted to reinvigorate British politics by allowing ordinary voters to have their own version of Prime Minister’s Questions, or PMQs.

Mr Miliband, who will put the idea to Commons Speaker John Bercow, said it would ‘let the public into our politics’. But critics claimed the sessions would undermine Britain’s representative democracy, in which MPs reflect their constituents’ concerns.

No10 said it would consider the idea, but raised doubts about how voters in Cumbria, Northern Ireland or Penzance would be able to take part.

He is the second theatre figure linked to the Labour leader in recent months. Earlier this year it was reported that Donmar theatre boss Josie Rourke has helped him with voice projection and posture.

Yesterday, questioned on his image, Mr Miliband laughed at the Wallace-inspired cartoons of himself when Andrew Marr produced copies on air. 

Mr Marr said there was an 'Ed Miliband problem' at the top of the Labour party which was putting off voters.

'You have got very poor leadership ratings at the moment. And you enemies are trying to dig into people's heads an image of you which is then very, very hard to remove.'

At this point he produced newspaper cartoons of Mr Miliband portrayed as Wallace in various scenarios.

'You are going to show it to me? Brilliant,' Mr Miliband said, nervously.

Mr Mrr continued: 'That's one of you on fire... you have clearly bitten someone there...'

Mr Miliband sought to laugh it off, telling the presenter: 'I didn't realise you were going to bring me present, that's incredibly kind. I will show it to my kids.'

Mr Miliband joked that he was going to give the cartoons to his sons, as he again insisted he did not think image was important

Labour hope to turn the personal attacks on Mr Miliband into an advantage, believing voters are fed up with spin and PR being considered more important than policies.

This week a string of senior frontbenchers will being a series of speeches on what Labour would do if Mr Miliband becomes Prime Minister next year.

But the high-risk strategy has only succeeded in turning the spotlight back on Mr Miliband's woeful personal approval ratings.

'Mr Miliband said: 'I want to find ways to change our political culture.

'I have had lots of people saying to me over three or four years I have been leader "why don't you do more things like David Cameron" - things like the photo with the huskies that he did in the Arctic Circle, the wind turbine on the roof, things like that.

'What I have worked out is personally, I don't care about it that much. Of course communications is an important part of modern politics, I'm not pretending it isn't. And image as well.

'But I don't care... It is not the most important thing.'

Mr Marr, a former newspaper editor and ex-BBC political editor, told Mr Miliband repeatedly that image 'does matter' in 21st century politics

Labour hope to portray Mr Miliband as someone who is more focused on changing the country than how he looks on camera

But in an extraordinary riposte, Mr Marr, a former BBC political editor and editor of The Independent, said he was wrong.

Mr Marr told him: 'You may hate it, you may think it is trivial, you may think it is awful, but it's how things are done now.

'Just as how in the Victorian period you had to stand up and make a three-hour speech in front of 300 people, now you have to do photo opportunities and deal with the internet and memes and so forth.

'Therefore it is the job, it is the duty of a political leader to be better at it that you have been.

'It is not enough to say " it doesn't matter". It does matter. It's the way things are done.'

Mr Miliband insisted he would 'keep trying', adding: 'What I was saying was not photos don't matter or I am never doing to take photos.

'It is more what do we really value most. What is really going to change things for people.'
