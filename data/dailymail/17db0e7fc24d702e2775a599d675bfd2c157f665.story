Will.i.am today became the first person to debut a record on the red planet.

In an unlikely tie-in with NASA, the Black Eyed Peas hitmaker – who has signed up for a second series of BBC One talent show The Voice – played his new song through the Curiosity rover that landed successfully on Mars earlier this month.

'It seems surreal,' said will.i.am.

He told students how Charles Bolden, the Nasa administrator, had called him to suggest beaming a song back from Mars as part of educational outreach efforts by the US space agency.

The song, which includes lyrics 'I know that Mars might be far, but baby it ain't really that far, features a 40-piece orchestra including French horns.

The 37-year-old, whose real name William James Adams, told a student audience that he didn't 'want to do a song that was done on a computer,' given that it was going to be the first piece of music broadcast back to the Earth from Mars.

'I wanted to show human collaboration and have an orchestra there and something that would be timeless, and translated in different cultures, not have like a hip hop beat or a dance beat,' he said.

'A lot of times ... people in my field aren't supposed to try to execute something classical, or orchestral, so I wanted to break that stigma.'

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden also addressed the crowd in a video message encouraging students to study science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).

'Mars has always fascinated us, and the things Curiosity tells us about it will help us learn about whether or not life was possible there,' Bolden said.

'And what future human explorers can expect. will.i.am has provided the first song on our playlist of Mars exploration.'

Space shuttle astronaut Leland Melvin said, 'I can think of no greater way to honor NASA pioneer Neil Armstrong's life and legacy than to inspire today's students to follow his path.

'That first footprint that Neil placed on the lunar surface left an indelible mark in history.

'Perhaps one of our students here today or watching on NASA Television will be the first to set foot on the surface of Mars and continue humanity's quest to explore.'

It wasn'’t be the first time the rapper has been involved in a science stunt.

On Election Day in 2008, he appeared on American news channel CNN as a hologram.

The star was present at the Pasadena laboratory when the rover landed on Mars on August 12.

NASA said last night that the track describes Will.i.am’s passion for science, technology and space exploration.

Will.i.am,
real name William James Adams, has sold 9.5 million singles in Britain 
either as a solo artist or with the Black Eyed Peas.
