Like the poet William Wordsworth, sprinter Usain Bolt and footballer Alan Ball, she’s certainly got the right name for her job - but could have ended up treading the boards if things had gone differently.

Sara Blizzard, 42, is the presenter for the BBC weather forecasts on East Midlands Today and North West Tonight - at a time when Britain is being blasted by snow and bitterly cold temperatures.

The presenter, who trained as a dancer and actor at Pattison College in Coventry, West Midlands, replaced Lisa Dransfield as the main weather presenter on BBC East Midlands Today in 1999.

Apt name: Sara Blizzard, 42, is the presenter for the BBC weather forecasts on East Midlands Today and North West Tonight - at a time when Britain is being blasted by snow and bitterly cold temperatures

She first started broadcasting for hospital radio at Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry and also worked behind the scenes at local independent station Mercia FM, before she joined Leicester Sound.

Ms Blizzard was then asked for a screen test by Live TV in Canary Wharf, east London, and was offered a job as a newsreader and reporter at one of their affiliates in Liverpool, Merseyside.

Her first day on screen was broadcasting from Aintree on the day of the Grand National IRA bomb scare in 1997, and she admitted ‘my knees didn't stop knocking until I got home in the evening’.

She said in her presenter profile on the BBC East Midlands Today website: ‘I really do enjoy the job because it is so varied and always live. We do not have an auto-cue to rely on during the forecast.

‘We also have to talk for whatever duration is required, so it always keeps us on our toes.’

Ms Blizzard, whose surname is her family name, has more than 1,750 followers on Twitter and said in the profile that her best personal TV moment was ‘interviewing Freddie Starr and surviving it’.

In addition to her TV work, she presents bulletins on BBC local radio and the Asian Network, while she is also the voice for the Traffic Master in-car information system used by various manufacturers.

Ms Blizzard is presenting the weather at a time when thousands of people spent another night without power and transport routes remained impassable as the long winter continued its grip on the UK.

People on Twitter described her name as 'apt', 'very funny' and 'prophetic', while Telford-based user Claire Alexander said: 'Think I'm being pranked - Midlands Today weathergirl is called Sara Blizzard'.
