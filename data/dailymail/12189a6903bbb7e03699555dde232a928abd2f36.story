It looks more like a post-apocalyptic wasteland than an inner-city campsite for families and friends.

But today police moved in on the largest Roma gypsy camp in the heart of Marseille days after the order was issued to dismantle the site.

But by the time they arrived they found the ninety families who lived there gone, having slipped away into the night.

All that was left was a forgotten ghost town of ramshackle huts, mounds of rubbish, wood, tyres and corrugated iron.

It is not known where the itinerants went as the long task of clearing up their village began.

It comes a week after police sparked riots in France after officers dragged a 15-year-old Roma schoolgirl off a bus in front of classmates so she could be expelled to Kosovo with her family.

Leonarda Dibrani was on a school trip when immigration officials boarded the school bus and arrested her.

She later described being escorted from the bus. A teacher 'told me to say goodbye to my classmates. I told her it wasn't fair,' she said.

Leonarda, who was deported to Kosovo with her family on October 9, said her life was now 'a nightmare' and that all she wants is 'to come back to France with my family'.

The government says her family, who had been living in Levier in the Doubs region of eastern France, had been denied asylum.

Itinerant: Ninety families have left this camp into the night to an unknown destination

Such expulsions occur 
regularly as the French government tries to limit illegal immigration. 
But the treatment of the girl touched a nerve.

Critics said police went too far and betrayed Franceâ€™s image as a champion of human rights.

The
protesters hope to pressurise the government into allowing Leonarda and
a recently expelled Armenian boy to return to France.

The
case has caused outrage across France and the government, trying to 
save face, is now investigating the case of Leonarda who wants to return
to the country. She has described her shame when she was escorted by 
police from a school bus after a field trip.

Immigrants'
rights groups and even members of the governing Socialist Party are 
calling the conditions of the expulsion shocking.

The
Dibrani family fled Kosovo about five years ago because they are Roma, 
or Gypsies, and face discrimination and few opportunities, according to 
activist Jean-Jacques Boy who works with immigrant families in the Doubs
region in eastern France, where the family lived.

The
Interior Ministry said the family's application for asylum had been 
rejected and it no longer had the right to stay in France. It said they 
repeatedly refused to leave, so police detained the father and deported 
him to Kosovo on October 8.

They
also detained the mother and five of their children, but Leonarda was 
away on a school field trip. Police met her bus when it returned.

This week an abducted four-year-old girl was rescued after a similar camp was cleared in Greece.

The
child, known only as 'Maria' and filmed just three weeks ago in the 
crime-ridden Roma settlement where she was found by police, is now at 
the center of an international appeal to uncover her identity.
