Victoria's Secret new Perfect Body campaign, which features ten very slim, tall models in its new Body bra line, came under some serious scrutiny last week.

The brand faced a backlash  amid claims it's 'body shaming' and is promoting unrealistic, negative body images by suggesting the 'perfect' body is tall and slender.

Today, fashion retailer JD Williams  spoke out against Victoria’s Secret's latest marketing campaign branding it exclusive and misguided.

Hitting back: In response to Victoria's Secret's 'perfect body' campaign, JD Williams has launched a #PerfectlyImperfect campaign to promote body confidence for all women, of all ages, sizes and shapes, which they say promotes beauty as a source of confidence

The campaign, promoting the hashtag #PerfectBody and claiming to provide the perfect fit and comfort, has been accused of using a toxic combination of super slim models and expert airbrushing to create an image of perfection unattainable for most women.

In response, JD Williams, a brand that Lorraine Kelly designs a range for, has launched a #PerfectlyImperfect campaign to promote body confidence for all women, of all ages, sizes and shapes. 

They say their campaign includes an image with a crucial point of difference - the models range from a size 10 to size 16, which they say promotes beauty as a source of confidence.

The brand hopes that by asking women to share their #FavouriteFlaw on social media channels they will be inspired to share the things they love about themselves and encourage others to look at their own bodies in a positive light - in a celebration of real beauty.

Ed Watson, a spokesperson for the retailer, said: “We have a responsibility as a retailer to promote positive body image to our customers and that means being representative of women in the UK.'

Susan Rigland, CEO of eating disorder charity BEAT, added: 'We are delighted to see JD Williams taking such a positive stance against the negative influence of the "perfect fit". We know perfection doesn't come in one size or shape, and how harmful it can be to pretend it does.

'We know that fashion has what it takes to get real and get in touch with what people want- images that show real health, real beauty and real lives.'

People have objected so strongly to the Victoria's Secret campaign that a petition has even been fronted by British students Frances Black, Gabriella Kountourides and Laura Ferris via change.org, demanding an apology from the American underwear company.

The trio write: 'Every day women are bombarded with advertisements aimed at making them feel insecure about their bodies, in the hope that they will spend money on products that will supposedly make them happier and more beautiful.

'All this does is perpetuate low self-esteem among women who are made to feel that their bodies are inadequate and unattractive because they do not fit into a narrow standard of beauty. It contributes to a culture that encourages serious health problems such as negative body image and eating disorders.

'Victoria’s Secret’s new advertisements play on women's insecurities, and send out a damaging message by positioning the words 'The Perfect Body' across models who have exactly the same, very slim body type.

'This marketing campaign is harmful. It fails to celebrate the amazing diversity of women’s bodies by choosing to call only one body type 'perfect'.

'Victoria’s Secret is hugely popular among young women, and they have a crucial responsibility to not use harmful and unhealthy ideas to market their products. We would like Victoria’s Secret to take responsibility for their irresponsibility.

'We’re asking them to change the advertisements and pledge not to use such marketing in the future.'

The petition now has over 20,000 supporters.
