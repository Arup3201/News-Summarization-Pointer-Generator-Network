A prestigious Massachusetts academy once attended by Senator Ted Kennedy has revealed two black teachers have been on the receiving end of race hate letters from 'someone inside the private school'.

Milton Academy has said that it has launched an investigation into the letters which were sent in late October after a meeting during which staff discussed diversity.

One of the letters was sent to Milton's K-8 multicultral director and the other was left for the academy's lower-school director.

Controversy: School officials say the Milton Academy's Multicultural Director discovered a race hate letter  a meeting in October to discuss diversity

The contents of the letters have not been revealed, not has the identity of the sender or senders been discovered.

It has not been disclosed yet if the perpetrators are staff or students at the historic school.

'I believe this was perpetrated from the inside,' said Milton Police Chief Richard G. Wells Jr. to the Boston Globe. 'It’s a sensitive investigation.'

Head of the academy: Todd Bland the head of Milton Academy has said that he hopes to discover the culprits during an internal investigation 

At the beginning of the week, Todd Bland, the school's head, decided to reveal to parents the letters had been sent, but told them the author remains unknown.

It is assumed the letters were handwritten because their origin remains a mystery, 'despite a thorough investigation.'

In his e-mail to parents, who pay upwards of $50,000 a year to send their children to the private school, Bland said he had decided to reveal the incident now because rumors were getting out of hand.

Bland wrote, 'this fall we learned of an act that occurred in our K-8 community that directly conflicts with the culture and values we work hard to cultivate at Milton.

'Two adult members of Milton K-8 received an anonymous letter that included hurtful and hateful sentiments targeted at them.'

He continued, 'this act angers and saddens us all. . . . This event should stimulate each of us to acknowledge our responsibility to speak up for inclusion and against both large and small expressions of hate, ignorance, or intolerance.'

Bland appeared keen to avoid embarrassment and told parents not to share the email disclosing the race hate letters.

'In keeping with our guiding principles of upholding our institutional responsibilities while respecting the needs and wishes of those individuals involved,' he wrote according to the Boston Globe.

'I ask that you do not share this message more broadly.'

Alumni: Senator Edward Kennedy attended Milton Academy and so did Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick

Speaking to the Boston Globe, Bland said that the school, 'responded immediately in ways that both honored the individuals’ personal wishes and upheld our institutional responsibilities, legal and ethical'.

Sensitive to the racial tensions tightened by the failure of grand jury's to indict in the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, the school said they are keen to handle the situation with care.

'This fall has been tough in K-8, at a time in our nation that also feels very hard. But we will make our way through this and emerge stronger and more inclusive as a community,' wrote Bland.

Indeed, despite its history, of Milton's 1,000 students, black students make up 37 perent of the K-8 pupils and 43 percent in the upper school.

The elite school boasts Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Senator Edward Kennedy as former students.
