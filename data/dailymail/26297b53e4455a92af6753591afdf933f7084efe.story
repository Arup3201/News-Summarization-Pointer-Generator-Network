Critics have been less than complimentary about his latest record, with one describing it as like being ‘serenaded by a well-suited mortgage adviser’.

But that hasn’t stopped the BBC from arranging a whole day of programming dedicated to Gary Barlow – and heralding the Take That singer as a ‘bona fide national treasure’.

Despite lukewarm reviews for Since I Saw You Last, Radio 2 is planning to broadcast a day of interviews with Barlow, before showing a concert it describes as ‘no ordinary performance’.

'National treasure': The BBC will flood the airwaves with Gary Barlow's voice next week

The first interview will be in the morning on Ken Bruce’s breakfast show on December 11. He will then join Steve Wright on the presenter’s afternoon show.

Barlow, 42, will later take part in an online question and answer session, before a live performance of his album is broadcast on the Radio 2 website to millions of listeners.

Does Gary Barlow deserve to have an entire day dedicated to him on the BBC?

The show will also be available to watch
on television via the red button service, and highlights will be made 
available on the BBC website.

The X Factor judge has recently made a wave of appearances on the BBC to promote his album.

One
Show host Matt Baker even told viewers he had been left in tears after 
listening to the record, Barlow’s first full-length solo attempt in 14 
years. But the schedule appears to have embroiled the Corporation in an 
impartiality row, with commercial broadcasters concerned that the BBC 
may have breached guidelines on editorial integrity.

The BBC has been reprimanded in the past for over-promoting releases by bands Coldplay and U2. Matt
Payton from RadioCentre, the industry body that represents commercial 
radio stations in the UK, said: ‘The BBC overstepped the mark 
previously.

Take That: Gary Barlow will be interviewed on three shows next Wednesday

‘We hope that the BBC Trust will be watching closely to ensure that this sort of undue prominence doesn’t occur again.’

BBC
editorial guidelines state: ‘Consideration must be given to the 
potential cumulative effect when planning to feature a specific product,
brand or service numerous times on our output.’

A
spokesman for the BBC said: ‘It is not unusual for an artist of Gary 
Barlow’s stature and broad appeal to appear on a range of programmes 
that reach different audiences, and is entirely in keeping with our 
guidelines.

‘We always monitor our plans to ensure this remains the case.’

However
Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the culture, media and sport 
committee, said: ‘It is a legitimate concern that the BBC doesn’t use 
its dominant position to snuff out any competitors. I absolutely 
understand their concerns.

‘This is something that the BBC Trust should be keeping a close eye on and intervening if necessary.’

Guidelines: The BBC has strict regulations to stop it over-promoting individual artists - particularly when they have a new release coming
