Americans who plan to mark today's National Peanut Butter and Jelly Day with a celebratory sandwich should be prepared to pay more for the sweet treat than in years past.

As data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows, price of two of the main ingredients that go into making an old-fashioned PB&J sandwich - peanut butter and white butter - have skyrocketed since 2004.  

The price of a pound of creamy peanut butter jumped from $1.85 to $2.7 in a decade - a spike of 46 per cent.

Favorite snack: Prices of peanut butter and white bread - two main ingredients in an old-fashioned PB&J sandwich - have experienced a sharp increase over the past decade

At the same time, the cost of white bread increased by 47 per cent, rising from 95 cents in 2004 to $1.36 in January 2014.  

And for those adventurous eaters who enjoy mixing things up with a sliced banana in their PB&J sandwich, the snack will cost even more.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the price of bananas has gone from 52 cents a pound in 2004 to just under 60 cents in February 2014. 

CNBC reported that when all is said and done, the combined increases in cost amount to less than $1 per sandwich, but nickels and dimes quickly add up considering how much PB&J is consumed in the U.S. in a single a year.

According to the National Peanut Board, the average American child will eat 1,500 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches by the time he or she graduates from high school.

Americans eat enough peanut butter in a year - a total of 1.5billion pounds - to make more than 10billion PB&J sandwiches to the tune of $800million.

The peanut butter sandwich has been around since the Great Depression, when cash-strapped families who could not afford meat turned to the humble legume as a cheap substitute for protein.

But it was not until World War II that the PB&J sandwich we know today became a beloved staple, as both jelly and the high-protein peanut butter were part of the soldiers' rations, along with pre-sliced white bread.

After V-Day, PB&J sales skyrockets in the U.S. thanks to returning GIs who helped popularize the treat, making it a favorite with children and adults alike.
