The iconic skyline of San Francisco appears to be nestled among the clouds in this series of ethereal images taken in the early morning fog.

Photographer Ali Erturk, 33, hiked to a beauty spot at 4am to capture the stunning sight of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge immersed in the dense swirls of fog. Only the very tip of the bridge is visible above the thick cloud.

At times, the 746ft structure across the Golden Gate strait, the mile-wide, three-mile-long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, was completely hidden from view.

City in the sky: The skyline of San Francisco blanketed in fog. The unworldly pictures were taken by German photographer Ali Erturk

Earth, water, wind and fire: After a number of failed attempts, Mr Erturk was delighted to finally get the conditions he needed

Mr Erturk, a neuroscientist, spent around three hours taking photos from Slacker Hill, overlooking the scene and the city from the north.

He said: 'Since I moved to San Francisco a few years ago, I have been trying to catch the fog early in the morning.

'I did a few attempts before, but could not get the conditions as great as this one.

'A typical sunrise shooting session starts about two hours before sunrise as I also like to do a few shots of the bridge among the stars.

'I had to drive for 15 minutes and then hiked pretty fast to be up there as soon as possible.

'While I drive, I can see whether there is fog or not and on a few previous occasions have returned back home because there was no fog.

'On best-case scenarios like this one, the fog covers most of the bridge and the land, but only the poles of the bridge and highrises of the city are visible.'

From day into night: At times, the 746ft structure across the Golden Gate strait is barely visible

Mr Erturk said: 'The fog in general moves pretty fast, and the level of visibility changed every minute'

He added: 'I was very excited to finally have the conditions that I was dreaming of and immediately started shooting with a wide angle lens.

'I also tried having some foreground, free of the fog that could show the fog covering the scene like a blanket.

'The fog in general moves pretty fast, and the level of visibility changed every minute.

'This reminds me of a ghost moving fast through the bay. While most of the time some parts of the bridge and city was visible, sometimes everything was covered and invisible.'

Mr Erturk, from Munich, Germany, said he was pleased with his photographs.

He said: 'I thought finally, after several trials of early wake up calls and fast hikes through the night, I had got my reward.'

The Golden Gate Bridge has been called 'possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world'
