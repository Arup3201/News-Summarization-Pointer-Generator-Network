A student used as a ‘human shield’ by a Panorama journalist inside North Korea yesterday accused the BBC of exploiting and betraying her.

The London School of Economics student said she was put in danger by the broadcaster and claimed she was only told the truth about its undercover film crew after an alcohol-fuelled night out in Beijing.

The young woman, who asked not to be identified, said the ten students from the university, the youngest of whom was 18, only learned they were to be used as ‘cover’ for the BBC’s secret filming  hours before they entered North Korea.

At risk: The student claims Panorama reporter John Sweeney only told the group about his plan to film undercover in North Korea on the night before they flew to Pyongyang

Panorama journalist John Sweeney bought drinks for the group before they were told of his plans to film a secret documentary in the Communist state, she said. At least one of the group was still unaware of the plan even as they flew to Pyongyang, she claimed.

She denied the BBC’s claims that all the students were warned three times about the potential dangers of entering the dictatorship with an undercover journalist.

Pyongyang has threatened reprisals against the students unless the BBC agreed to drop the documentary, which screened last night.

The LSE student said: ‘There’s a difference between a briefing about risk assessments and having a beer in a noisy pub.

'On our last night in Beijing, John Sweeney was buying us all beers and he bought wine in the restaurant. The next morning I was told they’d told everyone later that night about the documentary. I feel like I was exploited.’

Exploited: The young woman refutes the BBC¿s claims that all LSE students were warned three times about the potential dangers of travelling with an undercover journalist

In danger: If the Panorama team had been found out by the regime led by Kim Jong-Un it could have had dire consequences for the young students

The LSE has reacted with fury to the BBC’s decision to use their students in the documentary without its knowledge or approval.

The student, whose parents have made a formal complaint, said she had believed she was going on a university-organised trip via the Grimshaw Club, a student society linked to the LSE’s department of international relations. The club has denied any part in the BBC deception. Students were told Mr Sweeney’s wife Tomiko, an LSE graduate, was organising the tour, but were not warned of her links to Panorama or Mr Sweeney until they were in Beijing. 

The student said she met Mrs Sweeney in February, when she was told a journalist would accompany the university group, but was not  warned this carried any extra risks.

A meeting was then held 11 days later at the George IV, a busy student pub on the LSE’s campus in Central London. The student said: ‘I heard Tomiko say “Just to remind you, there’s a journalist coming with us and I’ve told you all about the risks”. I didn’t remember her raising this at all. It was all very off-hand. She gave the impression we didn’t really have to worry.’

At a second meeting in March, she was introduced to BBC cameraman Alex Niakaris, and claims he denied he was a journalist. The students travelled to China on March 20. The student said Mr Niakaris only told her an hour before the group left for their flight to Pyongyang on March 23. She said: ‘There wasn’t time to discuss anything. Once inside North Korea we knew everything we said was being listened to, and that our hotel rooms were probably bugged.’

Three students have complained about their involvement. Mr Sweeney claimed he had the support of the majority of the group.

The BBC said: ‘All the students were clearly briefed and the risks were fully outlined to them.’

■The BBC is today expected to announce the new head of its news division as James Harding, former editor of The Times newspaper.
