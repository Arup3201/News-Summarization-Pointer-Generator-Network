The very last piece of the former USS Guardian mine countermeasures ship was lifted out of a reef in the Philippines on Saturday.

The vessel ran aground in January and the Navy was left with no other option than to cut the ship into pieces to remove it from the water.

The final section of the hull, which weighs about 250 tons, was removed from the reef by the U.S. salvage ship Jascon 25.

Shipwrecked: The vessel ran aground in January and the Navy was left with no other option than to cut the ship into pieces to remove it from the water.

‘As the hull has been removed, the team is now shifting their effort to collecting minor debris that remains on the reef,’ Supervisor of Salvage, Captain Mark Matthews told news channel WTKR.

‘We also have a collaborative team from the U.S. and the Philippines beginning to assess the condition of the reef,’ he said.

Over the past two months the Navy has been working to salvage any reusable equipment from the vessel and remove any potentially harmful materials such as petroleum-based products and human wastewater.

‘Every salvage operation presents unique challenges. It has been difficult to extract the Guardian without causing further damage to the reef, but the U.S. Navy and SMIT salvage team with support from other companies and the government of the Philippines have really done a superb job,’ said Matthews.

‘I could not be more proud,’ he added.

No fuel has leaked since the grounding and all of the approximately 15,000 gallons aboard Guardian were safely transferred off the ship in the early days of the salvage operation.

'We continue to work closely with the Philippine Coast Guard, Navy, and Tubbataha Reef Park Rangers, and we are grateful for the support we have received to remove Guardian and minimize further damage to the reef,’ Matthews told the news channel.
