George Osborne has spent £10.2million of taxpayer's money modernising Whitehall with space-age furniture from the suppliers of the Big Brother house and the X Factor set.

Known for its 'quirky' style, Panik Design provides 'Diva Stools' for informal meetings and the shiny, white 'Mr Impossible' chair that X Factor's judges and contestants sit on in the boot camp.

The two-year design makeover was commissioned by the Chancellor to update his department in the grand, centuries-old Westminster landmark.

Emerging just days ahead of the Autumn Statement, it has sparked outrage as the nation braces itself for a new wave of cuts.

Mr Osborne was forced to reveal details of the renovation when questioned in the House of Commons.

It has now emerged the Treasury invested at least £1,300 in an item from Panik, which counts designers such as Calvin Klein New York, Vivienne Westwood and Christian Dior Paris among its loyal customers.

Before: The Treasury in Whitehall (right) is known for its traditional interior, unlike Big Brother (left). Panik Design also sells its modern products to top designers and record companies as well as Apple and HSBC

Universal Music Group, Apple stores and HSBC also source modern, high-end chairs and sofas from the firm.

A
spokesman for the Milton Keynes-based company, which claims to be 'the 
UK's largest independent stockist of contemporary design', said: 'The 
people that work there will enjoy it.'

Though
Whitehall is known for its traditional design, a further £1,969 was 
spent at modern company Ferrious, a design house that boasts 'the finest
furniture, kitchens, lighting and accessories all backed up by an 
unparalleled interior design service'.

Diva Stool: The ergonomic chairs sold by Panik Design are part of their quirky and modern range of officeware

Edgy: Bespoke firm Ferrius sells a £1,936 Artemide Skydro Ceiling Lamps which reflect light to 'create a sky'

Their unique lighting designs include a 
£1,936 collection of metallic pebbles attached to the ceiling which 
reflect light 'to form a bright sky' in the office.

Seating popular among their customers includes an orange leather armchair that rests on a steel chrome base, complete with an orange leather footrest.

The latest batch of office furniture for Whitehall cost £2,700 from innovative firm Senator, whose websites claims: 'Our mission is to design, deliver and manufacture innovative office furniture…of the highest quality.'

Grand: The building that houses the Treasury is a London landmark that was built centuries ago

Already modern: Many parts of the Treasury, here seen in 2010, were already sleek, leather and glass

To complete the modernisation project, 
£8.5million excluding VAT - £10.2million with tax - has been spent 
refurbishing the layout of the office.

Treasury minister Nicky Morgan said 
the spend was to support 'increased occupancy' of the 
building.

MPs have rushed to condemn the 'luxury' makeover as millions of Britons struggle with every day spending.

Angry: Michael Dugher MP who raised the issue with George Osborne has blasted the Treasury's luxury spend

Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher, who first raised the issue during parliamentary questions, told the Sunday Mirror: 'Rather than tackle the cost-of-living crisis Treasury ministers are living it up in luxury.

'Ministers have been shopping at exclusive interior designers to kit out their offices while families are gathered around the kitchen table worrying about paying bills.'

One a source in the office told the paper: 'I don’t see why we couldn’t have just bought new furniture from Ikea.'
