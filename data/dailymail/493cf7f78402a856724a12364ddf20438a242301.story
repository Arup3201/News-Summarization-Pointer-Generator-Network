Fashion photographer Mario Testino, who took the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s official engagement photographs, has been awarded an honorary OBE.

Peruvian-born Testino, 58, has built a strong relationship with the Royal Family since taking the iconic Vanity Fair pictures of Princess Diana just five months before her death  in 1997.

Testino is among a series of high-profile foreign nationals to receive an honorary award from the Queen in recent weeks.

They include Melinda Gates, wife of billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has been given a Damehood for her charity work.

Testino experienced 'total poverty when he first moved to London, but soon realised he could make a living out of his passion for taking striking snapshots.

James Dauris, the British Ambassador in Peru, said: ‘Mario Testino has maintained a close relationship with the United Kingdom over the years.

‘His work there, including his collaboration with the Royal Family, has allowed him to establish his reputation as one of today’s best portrait photographers. 

‘Mario’s work has contributed to strengthening the cultural bridges between Peru and  Great Britain.’

Testino took two pictures - one 
formal and the other more casual - of William and Kate at St James' 
Palace, looking very much in love and 'brimming with happiness'.

The well-known photographer revealed the relaxed portraits were taken with the help of the smae music he used while taking portraits of Diana.

The
tracks, from French singer Dalida, were played as the Prince and his 
fiancée posed together shortly after their engagement was announced.

Though
members of the Royal Family are used to being photographed, even they 
must feel completely comfortable in order to look their best, Testino 
told US Vogue.
