A great-grandmother who lost a book given to her by her father when she was a child has had the exact copy returned to her after 66 years and a trip halfway around the world.

Betty Fowkes, 80, said she felt 'very emotional' about being reunited with the book which her father gave to her for Christmas in 1944 when she was 11 years old – and which still contains the gift inscription he wrote to her.

Ms Fowkes' 48-year-old daughter Liz Crooks - who lives with her in St Andrews, north-east of Melbourne - found the copy of the book Magic Australia by Nuri Mass in a New York bookshop by a stroke of luck during a search online.

'It's connected me dearly with my past again and my dad and it's just blown away all the years that I've lived and taken me right back to that time,' Ms Fowkes told MailOnline.

The great-grandmother lived with her parents and two brothers in the Melbourne suburb of Northcote during World War II and times were tough for her family.

So when Ms Fowkes was given the book by her father George Wardley - a major during the war - she treasured it.

Magic Australia is a story book about two children who travel around Australia learning about their country.

'We didn't have toys in the war years and to be presented with the lovely new book, that's why it made such an impression on me,' she said.

In 1948 her family moved from Northcote to Fairfield and the book got lost during the move.

Last month she was listening to the radio when she heard author Nuri Mass mentioned during a discussion about books.

The name 'rang a bell' so Ms Fowkes asked her daughter to Google the name and check if she was the author of Magic Australia.

Ms Crooks found that this was correct but she told her mother she was mistaken, planning to track down a first edition copy and surprise her for Mother's Day.

Ms Crooks found a number of copies at second-hand book shops around the world and on a whim she decided to contact The Austin Book Shop in Queens, New York, because she had been a nurse at Austin Hospital in Melbourne for many years.

In the book's condition report it mentioned there was a gift inscription so she contacted the shop to ask for more details.

Three days later Ms Crooks received a reply telling her the inscription read: 'To Betty, from Daddy. Christmas 1944'.

Ms Crooks said when she got the email she felt like her heart had stopped.

'I thought "Oh my god, it’s Mum’s book!"' she said.

'I just thought straight away Mum was going to be so happy.'

But Ms Crooks said the fact that she found the right book straight away didn't strike her as particularly unusual.

'I don't expect anything less form the universe,' she said.

When she told her mother what she had found, Ms Fowkes was shocked and amazed.   

'She had so many she could have tapped on to and just something made her do that,' Ms Fowkes said.

They ordered the book and when it arrived last month and Ms Fowkes unwrapped the parcel with her hands trembling and tears in her eyes.

'I cried, naturally I cried for a long time. Just the hold of it again, it just felt that it was home where it belonged,' she said.

Ms Fowkes wonders how the book ended up in New York after 66 years and she said the book shop had not been able to give her any clues.

'Lizzie did get in touch with these people to see if they could give us any idea about how they might be arrived by it,' Ms Fowkes said.

'But they didn't show any interest in our interest.

'The only thing we've come up with is that during those days it was war years and there could have been American soldiers here and maybe they saw the book and took it home for their children.'

She added that the book is still in great condition, apart from a few drawings in lead pencil which she was able to rub out with bread crusts.

'There's not a page missing, not a page torn,' she said.
