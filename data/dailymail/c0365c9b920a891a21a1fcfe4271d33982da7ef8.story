Samuel Eto'o is seeking a route back into English football in an attempt to prove Jose Mourinho was wrong in branding him an 'old man'.

The veteran striker has instructed his representatives to gauge interested in him from Premier League clubs following his release from Chelsea at the end of last season.

Eto'o already has lucrative offers from the Middle East, but has delayed making a decision as he waits to see which Premier League clubs are interested.

Sticking the boot in: Samuel Eto'o is in talks with West Ham over a free transfer as he aims to prove a point to Jose Mourinho over claims he was an old man - as he did with a corner flag celebration for Chelsea last term 

And the former Barcelona striker's primary motivation for returning to England is to prove Mourinho's controversial comments about him were wrong.

During an interview with French TV, the Blues boss made off-air comments about the Cameroon star, calling the forward an 'old man'.

Mourinho was heard saying: 'Eto’o is 32 years old, maybe 35, who knows?’

Eto'o branded Mourinho a 'fool' in the aftermath, but the Special One's comments still rankle with the African.

And Eto'o wants to show he can still cut it in the Barclays Premier League next season.

West Ham have opened talks with Eto'o over a shock move for the veteran striker.

Sportsmail understands the former Chelsea striker's agent Claudio Vigarelli held face-to-face talks with manager Sam Allardyce in London on Wednesday.

And the Hammers are working on a deal to bring the Cameroon star to Upton Park ahead of next season.

The Hammers are desperate to sign a new forward following the news that Andy Carroll will miss the next four months with an ankle injury.

Queens Park Rangers and Arsenal have also been linked with the ex-Barcelona frontman, while he is numerous lucrative offers from the Middle East.

Eto'o is expected to make a decision on his future at some point next week.
