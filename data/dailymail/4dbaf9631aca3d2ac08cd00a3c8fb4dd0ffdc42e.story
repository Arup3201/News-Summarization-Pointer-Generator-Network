Mauricio Pochettino was in Milton Keynes to witness Manchester United’s embarrassing defeat, which offered him a timely insight into the perils of games you are expected to win and a close-up look at Danny Welbeck.

Tottenham are among several clubs interested in signing the England striker, who wants regular football away from Old Trafford. 

Pochettino, who clinched the signing of Federico Fazio for £8million from Sevilla on Thursday night, is also keen on Jay Rodriguez but the Southampton striker will not be fit until January and relations between the clubs were soured by a failed swoop for Morgan Schneiderlin.

However, the idea of Welbeck appeals to others at Tottenham, especially on loan.

Spurs boss Pochettino confessed United’s 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat to MK Dons was a handy reminder ahead of tonight’s Europa League play-off clash against AEL Limassol, which Spurs lead 2-1 after the first leg.

He said: ‘I was there, I watched the United game. It is a good example for us to be ready. We got a good result in Cyprus but we need to be focused.’

Michael Dawson has been sold to Hull but the arrival of Argentine defender Fazio means Spurs are still loaded with centre-halves.

They now have Fazio, Younes Kaboul, Eric Dier, Jan Vertonghen and Vlad Chiriches, who is fit after a back problem and in tonight’s squad, plus young players like Zeki Fryers and Milos Veljkovic.

‘We need to give balance to the squad,’ said Pochettino, who is open to making more signings. ‘I don’t talk about names, never. I always say not to expect a lot of movement but it is possible that we add some players, yes.’

Spurs have to sell to create space for Pochettino to achieve the blend he desires, but are finding it hard to sell the ones they want, at the prices they want.

Roberto Soldado, not in the squad to play AEL because of a bad back, is on AC Milan’s short-list, though the Italians appear to be making progress with a loan deal for Fernando Torres from Chelsea.

Lewis Holtby has emerged as a possible departure, with Hamburg interested in the midfielder.

Kaboul and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris are the main contenders to replace Dawson as club captain, though Pochettino will not make a decision until the transfer activity is over.

Asked if he wanted to succeed Michael Dawson as captain, Hugo Lloris said: 'I don’t really need to wear the armband to feel like a leader for the team. I am very proud to the captain for the French national team. 

'For Tottenham it is just the manager’s decision. I am not expecting something about that, I am just trying to do my job in the best way, and I try to help the team to have the best performance. 

'And after, in the changing room, I know that I have my place, and I try to be an example for everyone, and especially for my young team-mates because in the squad there are a lot of young players.”
