It was a landmark moment in her life and should have been one of her family’s most precious memories.

But Harmonie-Rose Allen’s first steps are tinged with sadness for her parents.

Just weeks after starting to walk, their daughter is to lose all of her limbs to meningitis.

The 11-month-old is on a life support machine in hospital, suffering what doctors said is one of the worst cases of the deadly condition they have seen.

Despite initially being given just a 10 per cent chance of survival, Harmonie-Rose is expected to live – but her arms and legs must be amputated.

The tragedy comes just weeks after she took her first tentative steps with a baby walker.

Family and friends in her home city of Bath, Somerset, are now hoping to raise more than £40,000 to pay for prosthetic limbs that will enable her to live as normal a life as possible.

Harmonie-Rose’s aunt Hannah Hall, 31, said doctors did not think her niece would pull through, adding: ‘The family feel like Harmonie-Rose’s whole life has been robbed.’

The baby’s parents Freya Hall, 20, and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong on September 27, when she woke in the night coughing

The baby’s parents Freya Hall, 20, and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong on September 27, when she woke in the night coughing.

Mr Allen, a customer service worker, said: ‘She had been a little bit under the weather all week. But we just assumed it was a cold and because she was teething we put it down to that as well.’

They took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath as she was finding it difficult to breathe, but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home.

The next morning Harmonie-Rose turned ‘all limp and she was blue’ and the couple took her back to the same hospital.

Following a thorough assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent away.

Just weeks after starting to walk, Harmonie-Rose was diagnosed with the worst case of meningitis that doctors had seen in years

But hours later she became floppy and lethargic and her parents took her to the hospital for a third time, when a rash was spotted. Harmonie-Rose was then taken by ambulance to a specialist unit at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.

Her devastated father said: ‘It was absolutely horrible. She was really lucky to survive.

‘Doctors told us it was the worst case they had seen in three years and they really didn’t think she would make the journey to the hospital.’

By the time she arrived at the intensive care unit, Harmonie-Rose’s arms and legs had turned black and her parents were told all four limbs would need to be amputated. 

The little girl needs two pairs of prosthetics to replace her arms and legs, which will cost around £40,000

She is still being closely monitored by doctors. The operation will be carried out in the coming weeks.

Mr Allen said: ‘We are hoping that we can buy her two pairs of prosthetics – arms and legs that she can walk on.

‘This will cost us about £40,000 – £20,000 per set – and we’re hoping we can get her some pink ones.

‘She’s a little fighter and she is going to keep on fighting.

‘We hope that she can carry on with life like any other children her age.’

Her father Ross Allen said: She’s a little fighter and she is going to keep on fighting. We hope that she can carry on with life like any other children her age’
