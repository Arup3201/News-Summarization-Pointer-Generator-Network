Mobile phones rather than bank cards could soon be used at ATMs to withdraw cash.

A new Getcash app has been developed that will allow people to take out £100 a time from thousands of cash machines with a few taps of their smartphone.

Royal Bank of Scotland has created the app which will be available to its 18 million customers who will be able to withdraw from any one of the 8,000 RBS, Natwest and Tesco stores, across the country.

Revolutionary: Smartphone users will now be able to access their cash without wallets at the touch of a button

The new app works by allowing you to choose the amount you want to withdraw from a screen displayed on your phone.

A six-digit code then appears on your phone’s screen which is valid for three hours and is tapped into an ATM to withdraw cash.

At first you will only be able to take out just £100 a time but this will soon rise to match the amount you can withdraw with a debit card, typically £250.

You can also text a code to a friend who can then withdraw the money.

To use it you must have a smartphone or an iPhone or BlackBerry and download the GetCash app.

But Simon Rose, spokesman for banking pressure group Save our Savers dismissed the app as a ‘gimmick’.

He said: ‘What about the millions of customers who aren’t able to download this app? Will they end up being disenfranchised by their bank?’

‘RBS might be trying to make banking look sexy but if the experience of the last couple of years is anything to go by, it would be better if they stayed dull and steady.’

RBS said GetCash would help revellers who want to avoid taking bulging bags or wallets out with them when they hit the tiles.

It said it would also prove invaluable to workers who arrive at the office only to find they have left their purse or wallet at home.

Royal Bank of Scotland has created the app which will be available to its 18 million customers who will be able to withdraw from any one of the 8,000 RBS, Natwest and Tesco stores, across the country.

The app could also allow worried parents of cash-strapped students to send money directly to their children if their loans failed to arrive in their accounts.

Ben Green, head of mobile at NatWest and RBS said: ‘This has never been done anywhere in the UK, and yet is a really simple and secure way to help our customers get cash whenever and wherever they need it.’

The bank says that by the end of July it expects customers will be able to leave their debit cards at home and use their phones to pay for items in shops - although it stresses there are no plans to phase out debit cards.

Banks and phone companies are racing to launch mobile payment technology.

In February Barclays launched its Pingit app which allows you to instantly send money with your mobile phone to others who sign up to the same service.

And in April phone company O2 launched a similar service. But unlike the RBS and Barclays apps which are free it comes with a 15p per message fee after the first six months.

However the technology has sparked fears could allow criminals to steal from users.

A poll for insurer Insurance2go found more than half of Britons were worried mobile payments would put them at greater risk of fraud.
