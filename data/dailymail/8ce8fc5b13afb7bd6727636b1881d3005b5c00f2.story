A hockey player has shared gruesome snaps of his torn ear after it was struck by a puck.

Christian Ehrhoff of the Buffalo Sabres tweeted three images showing his sliced ear after the game against the Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday night.

The 31-year-old German-born sportsman needed 40 stitches to repair his ear and proudly shared the before, during and after images with his 28,000 Twitter followers.

'WARNING, graphic images! #pucktoear #about40stitches #toughdayattheoffice #greatjobdoc,' he wrote above the pictures.

Ehrhoff, a married dad-of-two who has played for the Sabres for three years, is an alternate captain for the team.

The injury won't be the only thing leaving him sore though, as his team lost the game 5-2 on Sunday.

Fellow defenseman Chad Ruhwedel was also hurt in the game when he suffered a 
concussion after taking an elbow to the head from Flyers' Zac 
Rinaldo.

On the mend: Ehrhoff, pictured with his wife, needed around 40 stitches after the game, which his team lost

It appears that hockey players are in the
 habit of oversharing, after Mitch Callahan of the Grand Rapids Griffins
 uploaded an image on Wednesday showing his mouth after it was 
hit by a puck.

Callahan, 22, shared the bloody picture on his Twitter account just minutes after he was struck by a teammate's shot during an American Hockey League game against Iowa on Wednesday.

He lost 10 teeth and suffered a broken jaw and split lip in the incident and underwent surgery on Thursday.
