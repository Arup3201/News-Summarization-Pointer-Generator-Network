A teenager lost half her skull and broke almost every bone in her body after being crushed underneath a lorry.

Danya Cope was listening to music through her headphones when she was hit as she crossed a road near her home in Plymouth, Devon.

The 15-year-old's body was so badly crushed her mother could not tell if she was dead or alive as she lay trapped under the HGV's wheels. 

Danya broke her collarbone, pelvis, rib and leg and was left with a shattered bone poking out of her ankle.

Danya Cope, 15, was left fighting for her life after she was hit by a lorry in February. Doctors were forced to cut a six to eight inch hole in her skull to reach her brain

Danya (pictured left before the accident) has just had an operation to put an acrylic plate onto the hole in her skull which will fuse with her own skullbone over time (pictured right)

Her head was so badly injured she was taken straight into surgery where doctors had to slice away a six to eight-inch chunk of her skull to reach her brain.

Her family was told that even if she survived she faced being in a coma for six months.

But against the odds, the teenager woke up nine days later and doctors began operations to patch over the gaping hole in her head with an acrylic plate.

Seven months on and Danya is ready to return to  school.

The accident  happened in February as Danya was listening to music through her headphones as she walked to school.

Her mother Zarina Cope emerged to find her daughter critically injured in the road, a scene she said must be 'every parent's worst nightmare'.

Ms Cope, a supervisor at Clinton Cards, said: 'She left the house and I heard this awful noise. I just knew it was her.

Zarina Cope said that seeing her daughter in the road trapped under the wheels of a HGV was 'every mother's worst nightmare'

Danya was in hospital for three months and spent the summer wearing a special helmet to protect her brain

'She was under the lorry and she was making noises. She didn't see it coming which probably saved her life in the way she fell. She doesn't remember any of it.'

Danya was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth but was then flown straight up to Bristol Children's Hospital.

By the time Ms Cope arrived at the hospital Danya was already in surgery.

She was told the devastating news that her daughter might not survive the operation.

Ms Cope said: 'One of the surgeons came out after about an hour and a half and said they had done the operation but said she probably wouldn't survive.

'It was awful. Just to see her underneath the lorry - you just think 'is she alive or dead?

'But to hear she might not survive - there are no words to describe how I felt.

'They said she could be in a coma for three to six months. It was just like a waiting game of not knowing when she would wake up. But nine days later she did. 

'The first words she said when she properly opened her eyes were 'I love you mum', which was so lovely to hear.'

Danya was in hospital for three months and spent the summer wearing a special helmet to protect her brain.

She has recently allowed home after her final operation, in which an acrylic plate was fitted to her skull to cover the hole created by the accident.

Danya said: 'It still feels numb but feels pretty much normal. It felt heavy at first. 

'I can't wait to get out of the house and back to school' says Danya, who will rejoin her Year 11 class soon

 When Danya first opened her eyes after coming out of surgery, her first words were: 'I love you mum'

'The plate will mould into one with my skull. The stitches shouldn't take too long to fall out and then there is just three months where I might be likely to get an infection, but after that everything is done.

'My friends have all been amazing and supportive and I'm so glad I had them there. I can't wait to get out of the house and back to school.'

Danya said that after her ordeal she wants to urge people to look twice as they cross the road.

She added: 'I had my headphones in and was looking at my phone to pick a song. I must have just stepped out. That's all I remember. 

'I broke my collar bone, one rib, had a fractured leg, pelvis and all the skin gone from my leg.

'I had a skin graft from my foot onto my ankle where the bone was sticking out.'

Ms Cope lives with partner John Tremblett, 33, a plasterer, who has been Danya's stepdad since she was six. The couple also have a son, Ashby, four.

The whole family have been amazed at Danya's recovery but they are anxious to warn other children not to listen to music as they cross the road.

They said they do not blame the lorry driver for the accident, adding he was not charged with any offences.  

Ms Cope said: 'When we got back we tried to find out what happened to him. We didn't want to press charges, it was nothing more than an accident.

'We saw him when it happened and he was mortified.'

Ms Cope added that she is proud of Danya for showing such resilience in a difficult situation.

She said: 'Danya has handled it really well. If I had woken up in that situation and been told I had no skull on part of my head I would have been so freaked out.

'There were a few days when she cried but she has been so brave and resilient.

'All the doctors and nurses were amazed at her flying spirit and ability to heal really well. She has taken it all in her stride.

'She's my little miracle. I hope Danya realises how lucky she is and has a second lease of life.'
