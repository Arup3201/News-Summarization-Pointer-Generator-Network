The exact science behind how our Milky Way began has baffled astronomers for centuries.

But the discovery of a 'baby Milky Way' galaxy called DLA2222-0946 could provide us with the clues we need to reveal the secrets of our own creation.

University of Hawaii at Manoa astronomer Dr Regina Jorgenson used the most powerful telescope on Earth to make the discovery that could rewrite the laws of galaxy formation.

The galaxy DLA2222-0946, a young version of our Milky Way, was detected by observing its hydrogen emission as shown in this image of a chunk of the galaxy 16,300 light years across

The movement of the gas in the galaxy (red is towards us, blue is away) indicates it is in the early stages of forming a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, which could reveal how our own galaxy formed

The young galaxy was found 10.8 billion light years from Earth using a quasar, a super-heated region of gas and dust around a supermassive black hole, as a reference.

The discovery was made using the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, one of the most advanced and powerful telescopes in the world.

Thousands of so-called 'damped Lyman-alpha systems' (DLAs) have been found to date, which are galaxies discovered by detecting their influence on nearby objects like quasars.

But DLA2222-0946 is the first to be discovered that so closely resembles the same formation process our Milky Way went through several billion years ago, termed a 'baby Milky Way' by Dr Jorgenson.

'It's sort of extraordinary for being ordinary,' said Dr Jorgenson, speaking in Washington D.C. at an American Astronomical Society meeting.

How did the Milky Way begin? Observations of galaxies that will ultimately form the same shape as our own could give us the vital clues we need to explain how stars were created in our galaxy

Discoveries of this sort are all the more impressive for their difficulty.

Dr Jorgenson likened finding DLA2222-0946 as 'akin to reading the President's newspaper in the White House' from six miles away.

She added finding such a galaxy in this stage of its formation 'is something astronomers have been trying to do for over thirty years.'

The discovery was made using the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, one of the biggest and most powerful telescopes in the world

The galaxy is so far away that what we are observing now corresponds to a time when the universe was only 20 percent of its current age.

Determining how galaxies like this turn their gas and dust into stars is one of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos.

Continued studies of DLA2222-0946 could ultimately reveal this missing piece in the story of the Milky Way's formation.

Cambridge scientists have found evidence that the Milky Way was formed from the inside out.

Using data from the Gaia-ESO project, scientists were able to back up predicted divisions in the chemical make-up of stars.

Their research reveals how stars in centre of the Milky Way ‘live fast and die young’, shedding light on the formation of disk galaxies.

The scientists analysed the levels of magnesium - which is present in older stars - to determine their age.

Using the eight metre Very Large Telescope in Chile, they discovered the inner regions of the Milky Way were the first to form, explaining its 'flying saucer' shape.
