The deep red wine in my glass was tempting me.

But this time I didn't just say 'Cheers!' and take a sip, swiftly followed by another. Four words from Susie Barrie, Master of Wine - best known for pairing wine with food on the TV show Saturday Kitchen, were ringing in my ears… 'Stop. Look. Sniff. Taste.'

The previous evening, Susie had given an entertaining and informative talk on how to enjoy wine at its best. Now here I was, at the end of a tour of the vineyards and cellars of family-owned Chateau Siaurac, using my new knowledge on a splash of Chateau Le Prieure, a St-Emilion Grand Cru Classe, admiring its legs, swirling, sniffing, swilling to discover fruit, spices, mineral and floral notes.

Susie and I were aboard Viking Forsetti for a few days, taking a taster of Viking's new Heart Of Bordeaux cruises, which sail from the city on one-week itineraries on the Gironde estuary and Garonne and Dordogne rivers.

Two days before our trip, Susie had helped set a new Guinness World Record for the most ships inaugurated within 24 hours by one company, when she became godmother to Viking Heimdal (named after the Norse guardian of the gods) in a triple christening in Avignon on the Rhone.

The day before, Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry had swung the champagne to christen Viking Alsvin (a mythological Norse horse) in a ceremony in Amsterdam during which nine new ships were named.

With four more half-built ships christened via satellite in a shipyard in Rostock, the number of new vessels totalled 16. And by the end of the same week yet two more Viking ships, Torgil and Hemming, were launched in Oporto, Portugal, to sail on the Douro.

Although Viking's presence on the rivers of Europe has rocketed, cruises for 2014 are almost sold out, mostly to American visitors. And Viking aren't stopping there - their first ocean ship, Viking Star, sets sail next year.

The new 'longships' with their difficult names (such as Gullveig, Hlin and Ingvi) sailing on the rivers of France, the Danube and Rhine are all very similar.

They all have tasteful, understated Scandinavian-style decor using natural fabrics and wood finishes.

There is a choice of four cabin styles - mine was an airy two-room suite with a full balcony in the sitting room and a French balcony in the bedroom - but no pools, gyms, beauty salons or bicycles.

The emphasis is on going ashore, and the food and wine.

Rather than safe, international fare, as I had expected, I was delighted to find French dishes, such as soupe de poisson and boeuf bourguignon on the menu, served with Bordeaux wines (drinks with meals are included in the fare) and regional specialities such as local cheeses and pastries.

Duck and sturgeon, smoked on board, were some of the adventurous appetisers. On shore, we had time to take escorted tours and explore on our own. I enjoyed a walking tour of St-Emilion down a steep street cobbled with pebbles from the beaches of Kent. They had been picked up and transported here in the Middle Ages as ballast by ships returning to France after trading wine.

I visited the eerie and unusual monolithic church, carved out of a cliff by a returning crusader, and tasted local macaroons - not the brightly coloured type stuck together with goo that are so popular now, but delicious brown, chewy ones, similar to the traditional ones at home.

One day there was an option (for an extra charge of £145) to join a whole-day excursion to Cognac, to tour a historic distillery, blend our own brandy and take the unique bottle home in a handsome wooden box. Just the thought of brandy mixed by me gave me a hangover, so instead I spent a pleasant morning on board cruising from Bordeaux up the estuary to Blaye on the right bank.

Blaye, I discovered, is a small town with a big citadel, commissioned by Louis XIV to protect Bordeaux from the British.

Tucked inside its great walls is a tiny village, with craft shops, restaurants and a wine cellar in the quaint buildings.

Grassy lawns scattered with daisies were strewn with children, taking a break from their clip boards on a history field trip.

From the ramparts I had sweeping views of the estuary and the impressive form of Viking Forsetti moored below, waiting to take us back to Bordeaux.

Viking River Cruises (www.vikingcruises.co.uk, 0800 319 6660) offers an eight-day Heart Of Bordeaux river cruise from £1,545 in 2015 if you book by the end of the month. This includes return flights, full-board accommodation with wine, beer and soft drinks, and five guided tours.
