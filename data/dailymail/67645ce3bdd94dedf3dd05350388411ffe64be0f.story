UEFA President Michel Platini has criticized FIFA for publicly rebuking football executives who accepted luxury gifts at the World Cup, saying he will donate around £16,000 to charity rather than return a watch.

A FIFA statement on Thursday warned officials they had until next month to return the Brazilian football federation watch or face ethics proceedings for accepting a gift that had more than a 'symbolic or trivial value.'

UEFA president Michel Platini says he will not return the gift but will instead donate money to charity

The watch that has caused the controversy is worth £16,400 and is made by the luxury watchmaker Parmigiani Fleurier.

With each watch taking upwards of 400 hours to make by hand with precious metals and stones, the timepieces are extremely-highly sought-after and are very expensive.

The watch given to Platini is worth £16,400, but some Parmigiani watches - for example the Bugatti 370 model - cost £122,000 each.

Approximately £1million of Parmigiani watches were handed out in 65 gift bags by the Brazilian football federation to 32 representatives from World Cup competing countries, FIFA executive members and South American officials at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo in June.

Platini said: 'If the ethics committee was not pleased, they should've told us that four months ago in Brazil, when we received the watches. 

'They were aware that we were receiving these watches because everybody received them.'

Platini, who is also a FIFA vice president, added: 'I don't return gifts.'

Instead he will pay 25,000 Swiss francs (£16,400) to charity.

The UEFA President has hit out at FIFA for asking executives to return the luxury watches
