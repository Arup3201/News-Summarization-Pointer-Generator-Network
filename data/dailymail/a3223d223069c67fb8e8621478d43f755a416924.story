Struck off: Pathologist Dr Freddy Patel has been banned from working as a doctor after making 68 errors on G20 victim Ian Tomlinson's post-mortem

The pathologist who botched the post-mortem examination on G20 protest victim Ian Tomlinson was banned from working as a doctor today.

Dr Freddy Patel's actions were found to be 'misleading, dishonest and liable to bring his profession into disrepute' over parts of his handling of the post-mortem on newspaper vendor Mr Tomlinson.

A medical tribunal identified 68 failings, including the key fact that Dr Patel did not tell police that 47-year-old Mr Tomlinson suffered injuries that could have been consistent with a baton strike.

Dr Patel was found guilty of misconduct at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), sitting in Manchester, and struck off the medical register.

The doctor, who qualified at the University of Zambia in 1974 and has practised as a pathologist for 35 years, was excused attendance but listened in on the hearing by conference call from London.

The court heard Dr Patel, who was described as being arrogant and having a bad attitude, was previously investigated on numerous occasions and suspended two times over his shoddy work dating back a decade.

He had already botched previous post-mortem examinations dating as far back as 2002 by the time Mr Tomlinson died in 2009.

Dr Patel was found guilty of serious misconduct and suspended for four months over his post-mortem examination reports in 2002 into the death of a victim of so-called 'Camden Ripper' Anthony Hardy.

The naked body of Sally White, 31, was discovered in a room in Hardy’s flat in January 2002.

Upset: Ian Tomlinson's son Paul King and Julia Tomlinson have been left distraught by his death and she said today Patel 'misled everyone'

Dr
Patel explained away her injuries and ruled she died from natural 
causes. In fact she was the first victim of serial killer Hardy and 
suspected of having been asphyxiated.

Mr
Tomlinson, 47, died on April 1 2009 after he became caught up in the 
G20 riots in the City of London as he tried to get home and was forcibly
pushed over by Pc Simon Harwood.

Dr
Patel carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr Tomlinson and 
concluded that he died from a heart attack, but questions were raised 
when an American tourist came forward with a video recording of him 
being shoved by the officer.

Further
medical reports suggested that Mr Tomlinson died from an injury to his 
liver that caused internal bleeding and then cardiac arrest.

At
the inquest into Mr Tomlinson’s death, Dr Patel’s claim that he died of
a heart attack was discredited by the jury in favour of the string of 
experts who said he died of internal bleeding.

Dr
Patel’s first post-mortem examination also made it all but impossible 
to conclude with any certainty how Mr Tomlinson came to die.

The inquest jury ruled Mr Tomlinson was unlawfully killed.

The police officer who was cleared of 
killing Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London will face force 
disciplinary proceedings on September 17.

Pc
Simon Harwood was acquitted of manslaughter last month, but police 
watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ordered 
that he should face the internal Metropolitan Police hearing in public.

Scotland
Yard confirmed that a gross misconduct hearing in front of a panel of 
three people including a senior officer and a lay person. It is expected
to last up to four weeks.

Harwood
told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that he had used only reasonable 
force, and was cleared of killing the father-of-nine. Jurors in an 
inquest into the death had earlier returned a verdict of unlawful 
killing.

The officer, 
45, from Carshalton in Surrey, had a controversial disciplinary record 
before the fateful day when he came across Mr Tomlinson.

A
series of allegations were made against him over a 12-year period, and 
he was allowed to retire from the Met on medical grounds in 2001 despite
unresolved disciplinary proceedings.

Later,
Harwood rejoined the force as a civilian worker, before becoming a 
police officer for Surrey. He was then allowed to rejoin the Met in 2004
as part of its Territorial Support Group, specialising in public order.

The
Rev Robert Lloyd-Richards, chairman of the MPTS fitness to practise 
panel, told Dr Patel today: 'Your rigid mind-set, illustrated by your 
inability to reflect on the case of Mr Tomlinson and your unwarranted 
confidence in your own abilities does not convince this panel that it 
would be appropriate to impose conditions, even with the most stringent 
supervision, on your registration.

'The
panel considers that you have a deep-seated attitudinal problem. You 
have twice been suspended for your failings in relation to post-mortem 
examinations you have carried out.

'You
have now appeared before a fitness to practise panel three times. The 
failings against you both historically and presently involve five 
separate post-mortem examinations.'

Along
with Mr Tomlinson and the Camden Ripper case, other botched cases 
conducted by Dr Patel include those of a four-week-old baby, a 
five-year-old girl and an elderly woman.

After
the hearing, Mr Tomlinson’s family said Dr Patel should not have been 
doing the examination in the first place given his record.

Mr
Tomlinson’s widow Julia said: 'We aren’t surprised he has been struck 
off. It is more of a surprise that he was able to work as a pathologist 
for so long and that he was selected to do the post-mortem on Ian.

'We
are pleased that he will not be able to put any more families through 
the ordeal he caused us, but the damage he has done can’t now be 
undone.'

Last month, Pc Harwood was found not guilty of the manslaughter of Mr Tomlinson following a criminal trial.

Evidence
about his chequered disciplinary history as an officer was ruled 
inadmissible and the jury was not told about a series of allegations 
about his behaviour in the past.

The
officer, who serves with the Metropolitan Police, faces an internal 
disciplinary hearing being held by his employers next month.
