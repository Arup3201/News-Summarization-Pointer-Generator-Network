A Japanese mushroom could hold the key to killing the virus that causes cervical cancer.

The Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common, and highly contagious, infection that affects skin and the moist membrane linings of the body, for example, in the cervix, mouth and throat.

More than three quarters of all women acquire the virus during their lives and some strains can cause cervical cancer.

Japanese shiitake mushrooms contain a unique chemical called AHCC, which may help boost the immune system and block tumour growth

But new American research has found an extract found in shiitake mushrooms may play a role in preventing HPV-related cancers.

HPV is spread via sexual contact and causes cervical cancer in women as well as cancer of the throat, anus and penis.

Shiitake mushrooms, which have been used medicinally in their native East Asia for centuries,

They contain a unique chemical called active hexose correlated compound (AHCC), which is a mixture of amino acids, polysaccharides and minerals.

Currently, there is no effective medicine or supplement to treat HPV, which is associated with more than 99 percent of cervical cancer cases.

In the new study, 10 women with the HPV virus were given an extract of the mushroom, once a day for six months.

Of those, five were successfully treated and the pilot clinical trial  is now being extended to include a larger number of patients.

Professor Judith Smith, of the University of Texas, said: 'The results are very encouraging.

'We were able to determine at least three months of treatment is necessary but some need to extend that to six months.

'Since AHCC is a nutritional supplement with no side effects and other immune modulating benefits, we will be planning on using six months of treatment in our phase two clinical study to have consistent study treatment plan.'

Previous research has shown AHCC boosts the immune system by increasing the number of cells which help the body fight off infections and block tumour growth.

Professor Smith presented her results at an International Conference of the Society for Integrative Oncology in Texas.

It is understood that while the results were seen in women, AHCC will have the same result on men. 

It may also be capable of treating genital warts in men.

Earlier this year, she reported that in mice, AHCC led to the eradication of HPV within 90 days.

It also decreased the rate of cervical tumour growth. 

AHCC works as an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that uses a body's own immune system to help fight disease. 

Dr Smith said: 'AHCC is a common, well tolerated nutritional supplement that has been used for decades in Japan. 

'I am very excited to be pursuing a nutritional approach to trying to find a treatment for HPV infections.'
