US ambassador Mark Lippert, 42, was discharged from hospital after being attacked by a knife-wielding activist

The US ambassador to South Korea who was slashed across the face by an activist, said he was 'pretty darn good' as he was released from hospital.

Mark Lippert suffered a deep facial gash and stab wound to his wrist after being attacked by a knife-wielding pro-North Korean activist during a breakfast forum in Seoul last week. 

Speaking as he left Seoul's Severance Hospital the ambassador said he felt 'pretty darned good, all things considered,' after the 'scary incident.'

The 42-year-old, whose face was bandaged and had his arm in a brace, needed 80 stitches after being set upon.

Mr Lippert refused to comment about the attack as he left hospital due to the on-going police investigation. 

The alleged attacker, known as an anti-U.S. activist who was previously convicted of hurling a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador in Seoul in 2010, was arrested at the scene.

Police are seeking to bring charges including attempted murder against Kim Ki-jong, 55, for the attack at a forum discussing Korean reunification. 

Police said the motive for Kim's action was not known, but he shouted after the attack that he opposes the ongoing annual U.S.-South Korea military drills that North Korea condemns as a preparation for a northward invasion.

Seoul and Washington call the drills defensive and routine. 

The anti-US activist has denied that he intended to kill Lippert.

As part of the police investigation officers have requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government.

Kim also attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. 

The attack prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice.' 

Lippert had become known for an approachable, informal style since taking up his posting in Seoul in November and after the attack questions were raised about his security arrangements. 

Previously, Lippert was guarded by a single, unarmed South Korean policeman in plain clothes.

He refused to discuss possible new security arrangements, except to say U.S. officials would take 'a hard look' at procedures in South Korea and then make a decision, as he left hospital.

 'We have made it our mission to be open and friendly and that will not change,' said Mr Lippert at the press conference.

Doctor's removed 80 stitches needed to close the deep wound on the ambassador's face, Severance's general director Yoon Do-heum told reporters.

He said the ambassador still feels some pain in his arm, but it is manageable with medicine. 

He may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. 

The United States is South Korea's closest ally andmaintains a military presence of 28,500 personnel. While thathas drawn protest from some South Koreans in the past,opposition has eased in recent years. 

Aftermath:  Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage after being treated for his injuries, which include slashing wounds and nerve damage

Pro-US: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country against the strong US military presence
