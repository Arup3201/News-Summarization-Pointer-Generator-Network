A British couple travelling home from France died in a crash when the husband suffered at heart attack while riding their motorcycle.

Malcolm Hagan, 56, died instantly from the attack while Beverley, 53, was killed by the impact of the crash.

The couple, from South Hylton, Sunderland, who 'fell in love at first sight,' were together for 37 years and had one daughter, Gemma Hagan-McGrandle, 32.

Tragic: The couple were on their way home to South Hylton, Sunderland, from a motorbike event near Nancy, France. The crash happened shortly after their departure

Today, their family spoke of their heartbreak at the loss of the 'unique couple'.

'The only comfort that we can take from what happened is that they went quickly together,' said Malcolm’s sister Lynne Hagan, 59.

'There was no pain, no anguish, and that is what we are focusing on.

'Gemma was their only child and she has been amazingly strong in these difficult times. Now, we just want to protect her.'

The keen bikers had been attending the annual Pan Gathering of The Northern Pan Riders, near Nancy in northern France, when they were killed.

'They were good friends to many,' said Lynne. 'Generous, kind and considerate. They will be missed.'

Malcolm, a former squadron sergeant major, served in the Army for 25 years, including in Operation Desert Storm, in the Gulf War.

'The demands of military life place a strain on relationships and families,' said Lynne.

'Mal and Bev were blessed to have an enduring love. She was strong and caring.'

Their time as a service couple inspired years of charity work, which saw the pair helping to raise tens of thousands of pounds for various causes, and taking part in Rides of Respect at Wootton Bassett.

'They were generous to many charities with their time and money,' Lynne said. 'They were an example to us all.

'They enjoyed dressing up for special charity events, even turning out as Father Christmas for Santa rides - such was Mal’s authenticity to the Santa persona that he started growing the beard in September.

'They attended the funerals of many fallen comrades, so a Just Giving page has been set up to raise money for Help for Heroes in their memory.'

Scores of bikers and friends are expected to attend the funeral.

Lynne said: 'We are expecting a huge turnout for both of them. They will be greatly missed.'

Their joint funeral will be held on Thursday at Sunderland Crematorium with friends and fellow riders accompanying the hearses. 

In a break from tradition, Beverley will go first as 'she was the rock,' Lynne said.

The Northern Pan Riders club posted a 
message of condolence on its website saying both were 'enthusiastic 
organisers and participants' in events at the club.

'Mal's razor sharp wit will leave many with humorous memories and Bev's caring and sharing will leave us with warm reflections.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed the couple’s death. 'We can confirm the death of two British nationals, Beverley and Malcolm Hagan, in France, on September 3,' a spokesman said.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family.'

Condolences from a fellow biker in France. I've just watched my dad die slowly from cancer and this is the way (on the bike) I'd choose to go. No-one wants to lose a loved one but this is better than a lingering death and you will remember them as whole persons not as shells of their former selves. remember the good times. xx

RIP, but at least they went doing what they enjoy!  I have heart problems and it has stopped me hiking. I would  much rather die with my boots on somewhere in the hills but I can no longer leave my bedroom, alas!
