Kim Jong-Un is planning one of his 'purges' to rid North Korea of one of the country's most powerful figures, after the country's records reveal that they, not the son of Kim Jong-Il, might be the rightful heir to the communist state.

200 figures in Pyongyang are supposedly expected to be in the sights of the current leader of North Korea, because of their loyalty to his uncle, Jang Song-taek, who was executed late last year.

But Choe Ryong-Hae, currently joint chairman of the powerful Politburo Presidium and political director of the North Korea People's Army has been singled out because of the new evidence which could threaten his leadership.

Kim Jong-Un is again planning a purge of political enemies, with 200 of Pyongyang's most powerful on the list, as well as one man who might be a contender to his leadership in the eyes of history

New evidence from the 1930s show that it might have been the father of Kim Jong-Un's uncle who led the attack against the Japanese, and that this attack was later claimed by Kim's grandfather so they could be the ruling family.

The attack was a turning point for North Korea, and helped them to claim a part of the Korean peninsula back from Japanese occupation.

Grandfather of Kim Jong-Un, Kim Il-Sung, is documented in North Korea's official history as the leader of the 1937 attack on the Japanese base defending the town of Ponchonbo, which helped him gain a foothold of legitimacy in the claim of leadership of the country.

These reports that North Korea is looking to change it's history again are not the first incidence of such an occurrence.

North Korea regularly changes its own country's history, with children 
in the North being taught that the Korean War was started in 1950 by an 
invasion by the South, and that Kim Jong-il was born in a cabin on the 
slopes of Mount Paektu, when historians claim that the late leader was 
actually born in a refugee camp in the Soviet Union.

It was Kim Il-Sung (statue left), Kim Jong-Un's grandfather who is claimed by North Korean national media to have been the leader of a famous 1937 attack on the Japanese

Now, new reports indicate that it was Choe's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack.

A report in the Asahi Shimbun dated June 7, 1937 said: 'A little more than 100 men lead by Communist bandit Choe Hyon attacked Pochonbo.

'One group attacked the local police station, while another group set fire to the whole village and plundered at will.'

A second report said: 'They attacked and plundered private houses so Pochonbo village has been completely destroyed.'

Kim Jong-Un's other purge targets are said to be supporters of his uncle, Jang Song-taek, who was executed late last year

Ken Kato, a researcher and human rights activist, says the stories are evidence that the self-styled revolutionaries were bandits in the attack that killed two people, a Japanese businessman and a two-year-old infant.

Mr Kato told The Telegraph: 'They set fire to schools and plundered from fellow Koreans, and it is fair to say they were robbers who were stealing from their own people.

'Kim Il-sung's legitimacy came from propaganda that he fought against Japan, symbolised by the Battle of Pochonbo

The legacy and history of the Kim family has been the reason why they are able to cling to the leadership of the totalitarian country, which is why they are targeting any people who could potentially threaten that

'The Pochonbo battle made the august name of the president serve as a beacon for the national resurrection for all the Korean people and the trust and reverence of the whole Korean nation for the president grew more profound.'

The claim that Kim Il-Sung led the battle is reinforced by the KCNA news agency, an arm of the North Korean state media, calling Kim Il-Sung 'the legendary hero of the anti-Japanese war'
