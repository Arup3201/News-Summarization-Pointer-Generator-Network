More than 400 people will lose their jobs at the ABC, with shows and radio stations to be shut down as savage cutbacks were announced by the public broadcaster on Monday.

ABC Managing Director Mark Scott has told staff that close to 10 per cent of the ABC's ongoing workforce 'face potential redundancy' with most expected to be advised before Christmas.

The flagship 7.30 show will now be national, with all state programs to close. Radio stations across regional Australia will be shut and local sport coverage is all but dead.

The irony of this question asked of Mark Scott was not lost on those who vented via social media

Once was Australian Broadcasting Corporation, now?

'We regard the changes as vital to securing the long-term health of the organisation but I acknowledge that is no comfort to those who will lose their positions,' Mr Scott told ABC staff on Monday

The Abbott government has slashed $254 million from the ABC's budget over the next five years.

'We regard the changes as vital to securing the long-term health of the organisation but I acknowledge that is no comfort to those who will lose their positions,' Mr Scott said.

400 jobs to go

State-based 7.30 programs axed

Five regional radio stations shut

Local sport coverage to go 

Switchboards to be 'centralised'

Adelaide production to cease

Non-news studios closing 

Lateline moved to ABC24

Changes to Radio National

Bush Telegraph will end 

Fewer ABC Classical concerts

Lanceley Place premises to be sold  

Despite the recent petition launched by Education Minister Christopher Pyne, Adelaide's TV production will be shut down.

'The economics of the television sector make it difficult to maintain small-scale operations. It is more economically efficient to base production, outside news and current affairs, in Sydney and Melbourne,' Mr Scott told staff.

Local sport coverage has been cut with a focus on national events.

'With the ABC facing declining audience interest in local sport competitions and some codes chasing commercial opportunities, ABC Television is revising its sports strategy to ensure the most cost-efficient use of resources and optimal audience impact,' Mr Scott added.

Lateline will be moved from its current slot on ABC1 to ABC24.

Other non-news studios will be closed, as well as several switchboards around the country.

There'll be less concerts recorded for play on ABC Classical FM. 

The Lateline program will be moved from ABC1 to a fixed time slot on ABC24, the broadcaster's news channel

Five regional radio stations will also be lost in Wagin, Morwell, Gladstone, Port Augusta and Nowra.

The ABC has also axed rural radio program Bush Telegraph. The show, which aired on Radio National, provides an in-depth look at rural and regional stories across Australia. It's believed four jobs will go with the program's demise.

Foreign bureaus will be restructured 'to create multi-platform hubs' but there will be a post opened in Beirut.

Among the other proposals is the sale of its Lanceley Place site in Sydney and a review of other premises in the broadcaster's property portfolio

Mr Scott has also proposed programming and staff changes to ABC Local and Radio National, as well as those announced for ABC Classic FM.

Among the other proposals is the sale of its Lanceley Place site in Sydney and a review of other premises in the broadcaster's property portfolio.

Staff were told at a meeting and via video by ABC managing director Mark Scott from the broadcaster's Ultimo headquarters in Sydney.

He told them that 'in charting this new course, my thoughts go out firstly to those who face losing their jobs. As other companies in the media sector have found, structural change can have painful personal consequences'.

'We anticipate that more than 400 people, close to 10 per cent of our ongoing workforce, face redundancy as we adjust our activities,' he said.

'We regard the changes as vital to securing the long-term health of the organisation but I acknowledge that is no comfort to those who may lose their positions.'

Thousands of protesters held rallies against the cuts in Sydney and Melbourne at the weekend.

SBS has also been asked to find $53 million in savings over the same period.
