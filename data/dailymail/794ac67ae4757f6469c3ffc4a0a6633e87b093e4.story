Barcelona have planned a video tribute to Lionel Messi, which will be played at the Nou Camp should the forward break La Liga's scoring record against Eibar.

The four-time Ballon d'Or winner has scored 249 goals in La Liga, two shy of Telmo Zarra's record, but could increase his tally when Barcelona take on Eibar.

If the 26-year-old breaks Zarra's record, which has stood for almost 50 years, then Barcelona have organised a video tribute to be played on the big screens at the Camp Nou following the match.

The plan is for Messi to stay behind after the game to watch the video, which will feature a collection of his best goals.

In a remarkable turn of events, though, Messi was not included in the LFP's (La Liga's governing body) nominees for the 2013/14 best forward.

Cristiano Ronaldo (31 goals), Diego Costa (27 goals) and former Arsenal man Carlos Vela (16 goals) made the list despite  Messi being the league's second top scorer.

In fact, Vela was only sixth on the list of top scorers behind players such as Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and Arsenal's summer signing Alexis Sanchez. The winner of the award will be announced on October 27.
