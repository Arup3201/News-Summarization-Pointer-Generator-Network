Pretty town: Tenterden in Kent wants to change its clocks to Central European Time

A pretty English market town could adopt central European time – in a bid to boost tourism numbers.

Tenterden in Kent’s idea has been backed by the town's Chamber of Commerce, and if approved would mean the small rural village being an hour ahead the rest of the UK.

With a population of 7,800, the town, which has been twinned with Avallon in France for 25 years, believes it should be ‘closer in line with the rest of Europe’.

Mike Carter, the Chamber's president said: ‘‘I think we should seriously push this forward,

‘Tenterden is a real tourist hub and we need to cash in on the millions spent in the area and make the best of it.

‘I hope this gets people talking and thinking about the idea.’

Mr Carter plans to start lobbying Ashford Conservative MP Damian Green to put pressure on the government to rethink the UK’s clocks.

The chamber has a meeting with Mr Green later this month and he intends to raise it there.

Mr Carter said: ‘It was done as a bit of fun, but there is a serious side to it.

‘It would be great for tourism to have the extra hour sitting outside and people would save on their electricity bills.

‘For quality of life, businesses and leisure time it would be so much better.’

When Mr Carter raised the question at the chamber annual meeting, the majority of those present voted in favour.

Judy Turk, chairman of the Tenterden & District Twinning Association, said: ‘I think it would be a great idea for England.

‘Businesses would be on the same time and it would not get dark so early.

‘I can't say I have noticed having the extra hour when we have been in France, but then we only go for three days.’

Twinners are going to Avallon later this month for celebrations marking the quarter century of friendship.
