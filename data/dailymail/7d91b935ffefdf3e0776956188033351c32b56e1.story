Dennis Mitchell, 45, is facing more than 20 years in prison after being charged with attempted kidnapping, in addition to soliciting prostitution in a separate incident

A Wisconsin bar has been forced to cancel its weekly Lingerie Night event after a regular customer attempted to kidnap one of the bartenders earlier this month.

The incident occurred at the Eager Beaver Bar in Appleton on July 10 and lead to the arrest of Dennis Mitchell, 45.

He is facing more than 20 years in prison after being charged with attempted kidnapping, in addition to soliciting prostitution in a separate incident.

Mitchell 
ran up to the bartender as she walked to her vehicle on July 10 and 
tried to put a plastic bag over her head, reports the Appleton Post Crescent.

When the woman yelled, neighbors approached and he ran away.

The Thursday night tradition, during which bartenders served customers while dressed only in underwear, has now been cancelled.

Owner
 Christina Coon has removed all photos and mentions of previous Lingerie
 Nights from the bar’s Facebook page, but denied that this was an 
attempt to ‘hide or deny any events that have been held.’

‘All photos of our Thursday night bartender photos have been deleted to ensure the safety of our employees at this time,’ wrote Coon in the message posted last Tuesday.

'Unfortunately it only takes one mans lack of good judgement to ruin things for all.'

This isn’t enough for some locals, who are demanding that the bar be shut and have launched an Eager to Close the Beaver Facebook page.

Mitchell was a regular at the bar prior to his arrest and Coon told authorities that she had previously asked him to stop photographing bartenders during Lingerie Nights.

Police have also linked his truck to a solicitation of prostitution incident in May, when he allegedly offered a woman walking down the street $1,000 for oral sex, police say.

Mitchell appeared in court last week and his bond was set at $50,000. He is scheduled back in court on July 24.
