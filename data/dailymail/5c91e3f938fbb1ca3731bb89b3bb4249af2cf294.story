Former French First Lady Carla Bruni has waded into the row over Francois Hollande's affair by saying he had no right to privacy because public money was involved.

The wife of former leader Nicolas Sarkozy complained privacy laws in France were the strictest in the world - and the liaison would have been exposed by foreign media anyway.

Actress Julie Gayet won £12,400 in damages from the French magazine Closer last month after it published photos which it said were of President Hollande leaving her Paris flat.

The story caused a national scandal in France and saw Hollande's long-term partner Valerie Trierweiler move out of the Elysee Palace.

She publicly blamed 'low blows' and 'betrayals' for the break-up in January, adding it had been ‘like being hit by a high speed train', and checked herself into a public hospital for eight days suffering from stress.

The incident sparked outcry in some quarters of France, which has some of the strictest privacy laws in the world.

But in an interview with the New York Post this week, Italian-born former model Ms Bruni, 46, said: 'You must understand that France has a law that is supposed to protect privacy. But nowhere else in the world does such a law exist.

'This is public money, right? So 
it can’t be private. If the French magazine won’t publish this kind of 
story, the Belgian one will, and it comes out everywhere.'

Earlier this year 41-year-old Ms Gayet 
launched a criminal claim for breach of privacy against the magazine for
 using the photos, which showed the man it claimed was the President 
with his face concealed inside a motorcycle helmet.

He was identified using his shoes and the VIP bodyguards around him.

She
 demanded £40,000, but was awarded just £12,000 after the magazine 
argued it was covering a security risk to the president about which the public
 needed to know.
