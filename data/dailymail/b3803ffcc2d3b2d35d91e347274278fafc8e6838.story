A bridegroom who lost his legs under a train has fulfilled his dream of dancing with his new bride after eight months of practice.

Nathan Stephens, 25, promised bride Charlene Beard, 26, they would have the traditional first dance together at their wedding reception.

The Paralympic athlete, who lost both of his legs under a train when he was just nine-years-old, secretly practised the dance routine with his wife in their living room ahead of the ceremony.

Nathan Stephens, 25, who lost his legs under a train, stunned his wedding guests by dancing for the first time with his new bride, Charlene Beard, 26

Mr Stephens from Bridgend, South Wales has competed in the Paralympic Games for Great Britain but never wears prosthetic legs as they cause him 'agony'

His stunned wedding guests watched in surprise as Mr Stephens wheeled himself out of the reception and to a cupboard where a pair of prosthetic legs had been hidden away from sight.

Moments later guests cheered and applauded as the newlywed couple took to the floor and performed the three-minute routine - described as good enough for Strictly Come Dancing.

Mr Stephens said: 'I wanted to dance with Charlene more than anything but not pushing myself along in my wheelchair.

'I was adamant I was going to do it on my legs and if I set my mind to something I always get there.

'We practised for eight months in our living room and no one had a clue.

'It was all a bit new to me because I’d never danced before but after a while we threw in a few twirls.'

He said he has owned a pair of prosthetic legs for years but never used them because they are agony to wear for long.

But he went through the pain barrier for his new bride and their 130 wedding guests as he danced to their favourite song I Won’t Give Up by Jason Mraz.

He said: 'My older brother Andrew burst into tears, I think everyone was crying.

'I have not worn my legs for years and most people at the reception had never seen me standing up out of my wheelchair before.

'We knew it would be a spectacular start to our night.

'I was more nervous walking onto the dance floor than when I competed in the London Olympics.

'But we had rehearsed so well it went off like a dream.'

Mr Stephens was playing on his way home from a friend’s birthday party when he tried to jump on a passing freight train when he was nine.

He survived only because emergency services got him to hospital in time to stop him bleeding to death.

He then spent four weeks in intensive care after having his left leg amputated at the hip and his right above the knee in the accident, but soon rebuilt his life as an athlete.

At the age of 16 he broke the British senior records in the javelin, discus and shot put.

He represented the Great Britain ice sledge hockey team at the 2006 Winter Paralympics and competed in three events in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing.

Mr Stephens finished 11th in discus, 8th in shot put and 4th in the javelin. He later broke the world record in the men’s javelin with a distance of 41.37 metres thrown from his wheelchair.

After three years together he proposed to his wife, a hospital customer services adviser, at the London Games last year.

They were married at the Celtic Manor Golf Resort in Newport, South Wales, on Saturday.

He said: 'Charlene’s been my rock, she tells me to stop whingeing and get on with things.

'I am so lucky she is my wife - dancing with her on our wedding day was one of the best moments of my life.'

The couple, now living in Cardiff, fly off on honeymoon to Sardinia this weekend and Mr Stephen said he is packing his legs.

He said: 'This time we will dance under the stars.'

Mrs Stephens, originially from Worcester, said: 'We practised our dance for hours and we carried it off on our big day. I am so proud of him.

'We had it filmed and I will treasure the video for ever.'
