With a top speed of 10mph (if you pedal very hard) this shiny gold Porsche may not enjoy the usual performance of a supercar.

But Austrian Johannes Langeder, 48, is still delighted with his  life-sized pedal-powered eco-friendly car, which cost €13,000 (£11,000) to build.  

This week he took the car out for its first trip around the city of Hamburg, in northern Germany and pointed out that not only is it the quietest vehicle on the road, it also has zero emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly Porsche ever.

'It has 24 gears which is pretty impressive, and at the end of the day I am finally driving around in a Porsche,' he said.

With a top speed of 10mph (if you pedal hard) this shiny gold Porsche may not enjoy the usual performance of a supercar. But Austrian Johannes Langeder, 48, is still delighted with his life-sized pedal-powered eco-friendly car, which cost £11,000 to build

Porsche price: £129,950Cardboard car: €13,000 (£11,000)

Porsche speed: 196mphCardboard car: 10mph

Porsche performance: 0-60 taking 3.5secCardboard car: As fast as your legs can go

Porsche weight: 1,375 kgCardboard car: 99.6 kilograms

Average Porsche production time: 5 daysCardboard car: 1,000 hours over 6 months

Special features inside the two-seat vehicle include a rear wing and massive air inlets on the front spoiler to help with aero dynamics and 'save the driver from sweating too much'. 

The car's base is made of steel-frame but the rest of the vehicle is made of plastic tubes, aluminium foil and rolls and rolls of tape.

It took Mr Langeder took 6 months and 1,000 hours to build in a garage.

Unlike its mechanical counterpart which costs £129,950 and does 0-60 in 3.7 seconds, the model does not have a twin-turbo or produce 450bhp from a 3.6-litre air-cooled flat-six engine. 

It is entirely man-powered - thanks to a bicycle fitted underneath the hood and can reach a top speed of 10mph.

And with 
its extra quiet engine his Ferdinand GT3 RSX, also attracts plenty
 of attention from the police, who stopped him on at least one occasion 
to give the car a thorough check before ruling the paperwork was in 
order, and allowing it to carry on.

This gold-coated car is Mr Langeder's first creation - after this he made a custom-made Fahrradi Farfall FFX

 'I wanted to build a car that accords with my idea of future. There are no original parts,' says the creator

Mr Langeder  said: 'It is treated like a bicycle by the law and I wanted to show that a car needed no fuel'

Mr Langeder is very proud of his creation that weighs just 99.6 kilograms and is considerably cheaper than the real version 

The
 motor also has the ability to reverse, but only in the same way that 
Fred Flintstone manages it - by putting his finger on the floor and 
pushing backwards. 

Mr Langeder decided to build the Porsche when he realised it was legal to 'drive' the pedal-powered car on Austrian roads.

He said: 'It is treated like a bicycle by the law and I wanted to show that a car needed no fuel. 

'I wanted to build a car that accords with my idea of future. There are no original parts.' 

The car is even fitted with brake lights which are activated when the driver needs to stop on the road - albeit at a slow speed

The car is covered in gold aluminum foil  -  it took Mr Langeder 1,000 hours over six months to build the car

'The most impressive feature is its extreme slowness - everyone on the street is faster than you. 

'You are no enemy to other road users and the slowness is a kind of luxury. 

'Most car drivers need a second look before they realise it is technically a bicycle. 

'Most of them are very enthusiastic and get their cameras out.'  

Mr Langeder,
 originally from the northern Austrian city of Linz built the car in 2010
 and it has since notched up plenty of mileage before he finally drove 
it to the local museum in Hamburg as part of an exhibition on bikes.
