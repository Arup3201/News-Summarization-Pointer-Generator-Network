Darren Burnett completed a golden day for Scotland at Kelvingrove as he defeated Canada's Ryan Bester 21-9 to win the men's singles at the Commonwealth Games.

His victory followed Alex Marshall, Paul Foster, David Peacock and Neil Spiers' triumph earlier in the day after the home nation beat Auld Enemy England 16-8 in the fours final.

The Scots had waited eight years for a Commonwealth gold medal before Marshall and Foster won the pairs event on Monday but Burnett's victory after 19 ends means they close out Glasgow 2014 with three - their best result since 1994.

Victory: Scotland's Darren Burnett won gold for Scotland in the men's singles bowls at Kelvingrove

The Arbroath policeman was given special dispensation to take part in the Games after Police Scotland cancelled all leave for officers across the country for the duration of the event.

Now the 38-year-old world indoor champion hopes his latest victory will earn him some more time off.

'It feels great to have won this title,' Burnett said. 'It's been a whirlwind year after winning the indoor championship too.

'The whole of the police have been behind me 100 per cent, it's been great. There's a lot of officers around the place right now and if they didn't know I was a policeman before, most of them know now.

'As you come through the security gates you get the old 'You better win' sort of thing off them.

'I'm due to go back to work next week some time. My immediate boss said I might get an extra day off if I won the gold, so I'll hold him to that.'

Burnett brought down the curtain on the bowls programme with a high quality display.

But he had to fight back after a slow start allowed Bester to edge 3-0 up early on.

The Scot pulled one back in the fourth end, before a remarkable four in the fifth and a three in the next put him in control.

After slipping 14-7 behind, Bester managed to claw back a couple of shots but Burnett pulled clear again with a three in the 16th after his rival's wild drive sent his bowls flying in all directions.

And he wrapped up a comfortable win with four shots in the last three ends.

Meanwhile, Australian Aron Sherriff eased past Shannon McIlroy of New Zealand with a 21-8 victory to claim the bronze.
