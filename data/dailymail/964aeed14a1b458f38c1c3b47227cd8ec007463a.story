Chelsea have opened discussions with Partizan Belgrade over a deal for 18-year-old Danilo Pantic.

The Premier League leaders have made their move after Juventus made approaches to sign the Serbia U19 international.

Talks are ongoing over a four-year deal for Pantic that would see him initially loaned to Vitesse Arnhem.

Serbian media reports say that Chelsea submitted an offer on Saturday night and that a delegation from Partizan has travelled to London to finalise the details.

Pantic is a stylish midfielder and Chelsea have posted scouts regularly at Partizan and Serbia U19 matches over the past two months. 

He is out of contract in the summer and Partizan are understood to have accepted an offer of around £1.25million from Chelsea.
