Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt tonight hit out at BBC presenter Gabby Logan for saying that the Commonwealth Games would be 'okay' without him after leading his team to victory in their relay heat.

Speaking in an interview with the BBC shortly after the race, the athlete said: 'I heard somebody say they enjoyed the games without Blake and me,' referring to a comment Mrs Logan had made about him and fellow Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake.

He continued: 'Yeah you, I am talking to you, she knows who I am talking to.'

Speaking in an interview with the BBC, Usain Bolt hit out at comments he said Gabby Logan made about him and his teammate, fellow Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake

Usain Bolt sauntered down the home straight to lead his team safely into the men's 4x100m relay final, which will be held tomorrow

The Jamaican sprinter was greeted by applause and the lights from thousands of camera flashes as he stepped into the stadium for his Commonwealth Games debut

Apparently unaware that he was speaking the the BBC, the athlete addeded: 'They are in the stadium aren't they? The BBC, Michael Johnson, I'm not going to call names, they know who they are.'

'I'm a fun person, I love to have fun, look at me,' before pulling a face to the camera and walking away.

Gabby Logan later defended what she said, insisting she meant that the Games were 'better' with Bolt

The comments came after Bolt made his much-anticipated debut at the Commonwealth Games.

Six days 
after arriving in Glasgow, the world's fastest man took 
to the track to run the anchor leg for Jamaica in the heats of the 4x100
 metres relay.

The
 six-time OIympic champion sauntered down the home stretch to help his team cruise into the final. Bolt took the baton from 
Nickel Ashmeade and brought his team across the line in first in 38.99 
seconds before applauding the crowd.

Their win means that the Jamaican team qualify for the relay finals that will take place tomorrow.

Speaking after the win, Bolt once again denied a report in The Times earlier this week that he told a reporter that the Commonwealth Games were 'bulls***'.

He
 told BBC One: 'It's wonderful, just like the London Olympics. The crowd
 is great. I have heard it throughout the championships and watched it 
on the television.

'I
 can't believe she [Times reporter Katie Gibbons] actually said that. I 
would never use that word. I love competing and I am here because of the
 fans.

'I am enjoying it. The people have been good to me and I would never say that.

'Everything's
 been good for me. It's just the weather. It's got cold. But I am happy 
to be here and I am enjoying what's going on.'

Of
 his first taste of action in Glasgow, he said: 'We told each other just
 to get it [the baton] round and not to stress too much about this one.'

He then said that there was one more thing he had to say, before launching his attack on Gabby Logan.

Usain Bolt was keen to put the controversy of the week behind him, being playful in front of the camera and taking time to enjoy the applause from the thousands of fans gathered in Hampton Park

Mrs Logan could be heard laughing with her fellow BBC presenters as Usain Bolt walked away from the interview, before saying, 'I got a bit rumbled'.

She then went on to defend the comment she made on Thursday.

She said: 'What I said was that it was okay without him and that now he is here it is better.'

'We now know that he is watching. He knows that we are fair and he is fair too,' before quickly changing the topic back to the Times scandal.

Bolt's name 
was greeted with a huge cheer when it was first read out by the stadium 
announcer and the roars only grew when he was introduced to the 
crowd out on to the track. There he stopped to interact with fans - even fist pumping one young girl on the front row.

Fans made Bolt feel welcome with a hug round of applause when his name was announced over the loudspeakers before the race

Yesterday it emerged that three security guards were reportedly 'sacked' from the Commonwealth Games for taking selfies with the runner.

The members of staff employed by Sword Security were on duty at the Lesser Hampden training ground in Glasgow yesterday when they are said to have approached the fastest man in the world to ask for a photo.

They were then 'punted' or sacked by a supervisor who had asked them to put their mobile phones away while the Jamaican sprinter was training.

It was the latest controversy surrounding the Jamaican sprinter who apparently told a reporter that the Commonwealth Games were 'bulls***'

However, after watching the Jamaican netball team lose to New Zealand on Wednesday, the 27-year-old said they were in fact ‘awesome’ and dismissed his earlier alleged negative remarks as ‘all lies’.

Bolt is said to have complained about Glasgow 2014 to The Times as he waited in the rain for a car outside the athletes’ village on Tuesday, just hours after meeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

However, while the six-time Olympic champion on Wednesday denied making the comments, the paper has stood firmly by its story.

Yesterday it published the full transcript between journalist Katie Gibbons and the athlete, with Scottish editor Angus Macleod declaring: ‘We stand by this story 100 per cent.’
