New York City would look radically different today if one very big thinking engineer had his way back in 1912.

In a New York Times article from that year, Dr. T. Kennard Thomson proposed, among other big changes, the complete filling-in of the East River, the extension of Manhattan by ten blocks to the south and several new plots of land including an island in New York Bay.

For decades, Thomson extolled the virtues of his plan, which he called 'A Really Greater New York.'

Among those virtues, he said, was room for 20 million New Yorkers--or over four times the population in 1912--and a considerable 1,400 acres of land that Thomson claimed would have a worth of $1 billion.

'A Really Greater New York': A 1912 proposal by engineer T. Kennard Thomson would have added 1,400 acres to New York City by filling in the East River, extending Manhattan over ten blocks to the south, adding new tracts of land and an island off Staten Island and adding land to Bayonne, New Jersey, among other changes

'At first glance,' Thomson wrote in a 1916 Popular Science article, 'a project to reclaim fifty square miles of land from New York bay, to add one hundred miles of new waterfront docks, to fill in the East River, and to prepare New York for a population of twenty million, seems somewhat stupendous, does it not?'

Despite his salesman-like panache, Thomson was actually a well-respected civil engineer of his day.

According to Big Think, Thomson had been involved in the construction of over 20 early NYC skyscrapers and many of its bridges.

But more than just a southerly extension of the island of Manhattan, filling in the East River would remove the only delineation between Manhattan and Queens--which would have grown the island several times over.

However, the borough of Queens would remain. Not satisfied with simply removing a river, Thomson proposed a new East River that would run straight through the middle of of Queens.

To the west would be mega-Manhattan with its ten new blocks extending nearly all the way to Staten Island and encompassing Governor's Island, which still today sits to the south of the island.

Governor's Island today is a popular destination for warm weather leisure activities, though it remains accessible only by boat or ferry

Thomson fought for decades to get his plan recognized as a viable future for New York. He even pared it down to a more modest proposal by 1930, but it never caught on and the borders of the city remain nearly the same today as they were in Thomson's day

To the east of Staten Island, a new island and two new tracts of land would create what the map calls a 'new entry point' to the city along with a new harbor.

New Jersey also factored into Thomson's plan, which would have extended the city of Bayonne far deeper into the Hudson toward Manhattan.

'This will mean an addition of one hundred miles of new water-front. New York's City Hall would become the center of a really greater New York, having a radius of twenty-five miles, and within that circle there would be ample room for a population of twenty-five millions, the entire project to be carried out within a few years,' Thomson wrote.

While he admitted that his plan would cost even more than another massive engineering feat of the day--the Panama Canal--Thomson believed the economic benefits would almost immediately refill the city's coffers.

Sadly for Thomson, his plan never caught on enough to come to fruition--even by 1930, when he'd reduced his grand vision from 'A Really Greater New York' to a smaller scale plan he dubbed more modestly 'New Manhattan.'

Even bigger than present day: Thomson hoped to add to New York land worth some $1 billion and enough space quadruple its population to 20 to 25 million

Serious interest kept the plan floating around for decades as Thomson touted the benefits of his 'stupendous' plan

Purported benefits of Thomson's plan included total space in the city for 20 million -- over twice its current population -- and 100 miles of waterfront
