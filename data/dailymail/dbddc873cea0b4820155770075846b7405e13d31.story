Auction: The best-selling author is to put her jewellery up for sale at Bonhams in December

Barbara Taylor Bradford is selling her jewellery collection to provide a nest egg for two distant relatives.

The 80-year-old author of A Woman Of Substance, who has no children, is auctioning diamond rings, ornate brooches, necklaces and bracelets – most of which were presents from her husband Bob.

She initially thought of giving the 40-item collection, which is expected to raise almost £1.5million, to the two women, who are described as ‘wider family members’.

But she came to the conclusion that the gems are not something they would want or wear ‘as they don’t lead the same lifestyle as me’.

A 14-carat diamond ring has been valued at almost £500,000 and a pair of Harry Winston diamond and pearl earrings is expected to fetch up to £75,000 in the sale at Bonhams in London on December 5.

She explained that much of 
her jewellery remains in a drawer at her penthouse home in New York.

She said: ‘My
 father told me when I was a child, after he gave me a string of pearls:
 “You must always let them breath. They should be out on your neck, not 
buried in a drawer.”

'Why was all this buried in a drawer?, Well, I didn’t know.

‘Then I
 realised I was going to leave that jewellery to two of our female 
heirs. They didn’t really want it, I don’t think, because they don’t 
really lead the kind of life that I lead as a well-known writer, and I’m
 out and about.

‘So Bob
 and I decided it might be nice to auction it and the money will be a 
little nest egg for them. Let somebody else enjoy those beautiful 
things.’

Miss Taylor 
Bradford has said she does not want to disclose the identities of the 
two women, although it is possible they are descendants of her aunt Mary
 and uncle Fred.

A recent 
ITV programme, Secrets from the Workhouse, showed the author  
extensively researching her family history, while she was also shocked 
to learn in 2004 that her mother, along with aunt and uncle, may have 
been the illegitimate children of the Marquess of Ripon.

Yorkshire-born
 Miss Taylor Bradford, who has sold over 88 million books in more than 
90 countries, said that most of the items were presents from her 
husband, a television producer with whom she celebrates her 50th wedding
 anniversary on Christmas Eve this year.

‘I happen to have a very generous husband, and he’s really bought everything that is going on auction,’ she added.

‘I
 did say: “Is that alright? Are you agreeing to this?” And he said “Yes,
 of course. I bought it, but I gave it to you and it’s yours and you can
 do what you like with it”.

‘When
 I look at those things and when I was going back in time, because we 
are coving the 80s and the 90s, a lot of the memories of how he gave the
 piece to me sprang in to my mind.

'I
 was very amused and very happy because I remember once for instance we 
were in vacation in Capri and I was reading on the terrace after 
breakfast and he said: “I’m just going for a walk to buy a newspaper”.

‘A
 little while later he returned with a large shopping bag full of 
newspapers. And then he suddenly reached in to the shopping bag and 
said: “I’ve bought you some flowers”. Flowers indeed! Sapphire, 
multi-coloured flowers in a necklace. He does things like that all the 
time.

‘It’s a wrench, 
but at the same time I’ve enjoyed those pieces and I’d had them for 
years and a lot of times they had remained in the safe. So, when you’ve 
owned beautiful things, and I still have quite a few beautiful things 
left, they should be in a safe. They should be being worn by another 
person, another woman.

‘The husband should be buying it for her. I don’t believe in buying your own jewellery if you’re a woman.’

Miss
 Taylor Bradford and her husband have never had children. The couple 
have tried to start a family in the past, but the author has admitting 
having two miscarriages.

‘I 
had two miscarriages and never got pregnant again,’ she said. ‘But 
regrets are fruitless and you don’t miss a child you’ve never known. I 
would have liked a child; I didn’t have one. What am I going to do? I’ve
 got Bob.’
