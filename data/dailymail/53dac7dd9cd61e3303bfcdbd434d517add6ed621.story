Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has warned his players to beware the unique threat of a resurgent Andy Carroll when the Black Cats take on high-flying West Ham United at the Stadium of Light on Saturday.

Former Newcastle United star Carroll grabbed two goals as the Hammers soared to their current fourth place in the Barclays Premier League table with a 3-1 win over Swansea on Sunday.

And despite his side succeeding in shutting out both Chelsea and Liverpool in recent weeks, Poyet knows they will have to be fully focused to prevent more goals from the 6ft 4ins front man.

Black Cats boss Poyet thinks Carroll offers a 'special' and 'different' challenge to his players

Poyet said: 'Andy is special and different and I don't think you can find another one of him in the game right now.

'The adrenaline of being out for a while has brought him back at the highest level you can have and you need to be able to deal with that.

'It's a difficult game and we haven't had that kind of challenge yet of a player like Carroll, so the goalkeeper and the centre-halves and everyone else are going to have a difficult afternoon.'

Having come through a gruelling period relatively unscathed - Sergio Aguero's mauling apart - Poyet has now switched his attention to his side's festive programme as he looks to build towards a repeat of last year's end-of-season form.

Fast-upcoming games against Newcastle United, Hull City and Aston Villa appear to represent more opportunity to turn a recent glut of four draws from their last five games into much-needed wins.

Poyet added: 'The challenge is to win as many of the next four games as possible. We are not looking to have four draws and if they are normal games without any accidents we need to win.

'We are going to play the four to win and then the season will be totally different. Winning games puts you in a different situation - it brings your confidence back.

'Last year we started getting better during this time and we had a very good run of results and took it into January, so we are looking at this period in a very special manner.'

Poyet is set to recall Steven Fletcher to his starting line-up after the striker was an unused substitute at Anfield following a slight knock which forced him off against Manchester City.

Sebastian Coates is available again after missing the game against his parent club but is likely to have to settle for a place on the bench, while Emanuele Giaccherini and Billy Jones are both still injured.

Poyet was buoyed this week by Connor Wickham's decision to sign a new four-and-a-half year contract, adding: 'I'm very pleased because it wasn't easy.

'The time was great for us and Connor to get to know each other better and show what he's capable of. There are not too many young English centre-forwards free so it was important for us to tie down Connor for another four-plus years.'
