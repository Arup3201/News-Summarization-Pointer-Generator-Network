A 4ft 4in-tall actor who appeared in Star Wars, Harry Potter and a series of Hollywood hits has told how he blew all his cash on drink, drugs and prostitutes.

Paul Grant, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, spoke out after pictures emerged of him snorting lines of cocaine and drinking cans of cheap out-of-date lager.

The 47-year-old dwarf, who appeared as an Ewok in Return of the Jedi and played a goblin in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, said his life spiraled out of control after breaking up with his wife.

Grant told The Sunday Mirror he cheated on her a number of times, went 'AWOL' and blamed himself for the collapse of their marriage.

He admitted: 'I need help. I've been on cocaine and it has just got worse. I'm drinking and smoking what I can get.'

Grant also had parts in the 1988 film Willow with Val Kilmer, 1985 Tom Cruise movie Legend, Labyrinth starring David Bowie in 1986 and Deuce Bigalow 2.

But the star's life has hit rock bottom and seen him spend time in jail after being convicted of common assault.

He told The Sunday Mirror: 'I had a family, I was married, now I'm divorced. I've lost everything. I've not got anything, my things, pictures, clothes are all over the place.

Grant also appeared in the 1986 film Labyrinth, which starred David Bowie 

'I don't know what I want at the moment. I had money, I blew it all, I spent it on drugs and prostitutes.'

Grant said work has dried up and he hasn't seen his agent Warwick Davies, who also appeared in Willow, Star Wars and Harry Potter and who now runs Willow Management, for two years.

In a 26-second promotional video he filmed for the agency's website, Grant says: 'Hello, my name is Paul Grant. I'm from Peterborough and I'm an actor.

'I've done a few films such as Return of the Jedi, Legend, Willow and Labyrinth and Harry Potter.'

He adds: 'It's very good, I enjoy it.'

Grant has been taken in by 22-year-old mother-of-two Chloe McCarthy and her boyfriend who took pity on him and rescued him from living rough on the streets.
