Isaac Martinez took it in stride when he was shot during Wednesday's deadly Arizona rampage, posting online a series of selfies making light of his brush with death.

Suspect Ryan Giroux was arrested in Mesa following an intense manhunt sparked by a shooting spree that left one person dead and five others injured yesterday morning.

Blow by blow: The EVIT student detailed the attempted carjacking, which left him wounded in the shoulder

Martinez was on his way to the eatery when Giroux allegedly confronted him in the parking lot and demanded his car.

Martinez refused to hand over his keys, prompting the suspect to shoot him in the shoulder.

Instead of calling 911, a wounded Martinez took to the social media app Snapchat, sharing a photo of himself in a white chef's coat spattered with blood. The caption stated matter of factly: 'I just got shot.'

The Internet-savvy college student did not stop there and continued documenting his harrowing ordeal.

After he was taken to a hospital to be treated for his gunshot wound, he shared another selfie, which shows him lying in bed bear-chested with a white dressing on his bloodied shoulder.

A friend of Martinez’s even turned one of his hospital snapshots into a meme, accessorizing him with a painted-on cigarette and dark sunglasses, along with the caption: 'Thug Life.'

After being released from the hospital, the 20-year-old culinary student offered his 1,200 friends an update on his condition, saying that the bullet struck him from behind and exited out of his collar area.

'Any higher or lower it coulda hit a artery, or shatter my shoulder blade. It was a miracle hit,' he wrote.

Martinez then proceeded to give a play-by-play of what happened in the parking lot of Bistro 13 shortly before 9am.

The EVIT student explained that when Giroux pulled a gun on him during the attempted carjacking, Martinez started backing away while yelling at passersby to get down on the ground.

After Grioux allegedly carjacked an EVIT teacher and took off from the parking lot in his Honda, Martinez said he noticed police and emergency vehicles down the street, and ran there for help.

‘I was the only one injured. Everyone else was unharmed. overall im glad it went the way it did rather than any other way,’ the 20-year-old concluded.

The shooting rampage that gripped the Phoenix suburb of Mesa in terror for nearly four hours was no laughing matter.
