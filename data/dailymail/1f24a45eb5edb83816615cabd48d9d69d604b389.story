A top Indian diplomat has been arrested in New York after she paid her house-keeper only $3.13 an hour and lied to get her into the country, federal prosecutors said Thursday.

Deputy Consul General Devyani Khobragade, 39, has publicly campaigned for women's rights and gender equality.

But the woman she hired to clean her house and look after he two young daughters says Khobragade paid her less than $600 a month - $3.31 an hour - despite telling U.S. immigration officials the staffer would be paid $4,500 a month.

Deputy Consul General Devyani Khobragade, 39, has publicly campaigned for women's rights and gender equality but allegedly paid her housekeeper $3.31 an hour

Khobragade is a prominent diplomat who has been posted in Pakistan, Italy and Germany before being given an assignment in Manhattan

Khobragade's lawyer on Thursday said that his client enjoys diplomatic immunity and said he would moved to have the charges dismissed on those grounds.

But U.S. Attorney for Manhattan  Preet Bharara was adamant.

'Foreign nationals brought to the United States to serve as domestic workers are entitled to the same protections against exploitation as those afforded to United States citizens,' he told the New York Daily News. 

'The false statements and fraud were designed to circumvent those protections.'

Prosecutors allege that Khobragade falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $4,500 a month.

Then, when the housekeeper came to the United States, Khobragade told her that she would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $600, according to prosecutors.

Khobragade works at the Indian Consulate General in Manhattan. She was arrested Thursday and released on $250,000 bail

Khobragade faces one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. If convicted, the charges carry a total maximum penalty of 15 years in prison

Khobragade had the worker sign the second contract, which she kept, the charges state.

She was arrested Thursday and released on $250,000 bail after surrendering her passport so she can't flee the country. 

She faces one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. If convicted, the charges carry a total maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.

However, the Indian embassy is already fighting the charges, asking the American government to have the case dropped on the grounds of diplomatic immunity. 

'The US side have been urged to resolve the matter with due sensitivity, taking into account... the diplomatic status of the officer concerned,' said a statement from the Indian embassy in Washington DC.

Further, when the allegations against Khobragade first surfaced, an Indian court issued an order against the housekeeper, ordering her not to take legal action against the diplomat, according to the Hindustan Times.

When it became apparent that the woman was cooperating with American authorities, the court issued an arrest warrant for the housekeeper and requested the U.S. officials have her detained and extradited back to India. 

Before being posted in New York, Khobragade service with the Foreign Service in Germany, Italy and Pakistan.
