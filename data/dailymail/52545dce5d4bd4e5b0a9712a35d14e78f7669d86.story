Fast food restaurants, with their focus on dollar-menus, questionable agriculture practices and ever-cheaper deals, will soon become a thing of the past, according to the chief executive of Chipotle.

The chain is poised to change the face of fast food in America, according to Monty Moran, and the way consumers think about what they eat.

Moran blasted fast food chains - without naming names - for their treatment of employees and the food itself.

Big plans: Chipotle's growth and popularity show that 'traditional' fast food chains are becoming irrelevant, according to CEO Monty Moran

'By traditional fast food I mean where the predominant goal is the cheapening of the raw ingredients, the automation of the work such that anyone could do it... so that they turn over their employees without any care for them, where it’s a game of value meals and cheapening and cheapening the food experience,' Moran said in an interview for The Street.

'That is traditional fast food, and we think that's going away. We, and others like us, will replace that.'

Despite being deemed 'irrelevant' by Moran, traditional fast food chains are still goliaths compared to Chipotle.

According to Business Insider, Chipotle has 1,700 locations that generated $3.21 billion in revenue last year.

Vision: Chipotle CEO Monty Moran says the company wants to 'change the way people eat fast food'

By comparison, McDonald has 35,000 locations worldwide which brought in $28.1 billion.

However, with plans to open more Chipotle locations and two new concepts in the works - Asian-inspired ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale - Moran's brag could prove prescient.

And while Chipotle remains small compared to multi-national chains such as Burger King and McDonald's, it's outstripping them in terms of growth.

Chipotle's gross profit margins were 66.6 per cent to Starbucks' 57.1 per cent and McDonald's 56 per cent.

'Our mission is to change how people eat fast food,' Moran told The Street.

Founder Steve Ells opened the first Chipotle restaurant in Denver in 1993.

It was a means to raise money to open his own fine-dining restaurant but when the concept took off, he switched focus to expanding the chain.

All Chipotle restaurants are company-owned - there are no franchises.

'Our vision is that any concept we are involved with will benefit from our unique people culture. We think that the people culture and food culture, as well as the unit economic model, are what yields the extraordinary success that we've had, and are keys to any concept going forward,' Moran said.
