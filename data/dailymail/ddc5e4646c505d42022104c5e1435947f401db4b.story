A girlfriend made her partner of six years wear a T-shirt covered in pictures of the two of them together.

Abbie Bartlett, 20, had the shirt custom-made for her boyfriend Leon Connolly, 24.

It bears the uncompromising message: 'I love my girlfriend Abbie, I hate the girls in Ibiza, so please stay away from me'.

Back off: Leon Connolly, 24, was given this t-shirt to wear on a holiday to Ibiza with friends

Miss Bartlett told how she produced the shirt as a surprise as he was packing his bags to leave.

Pictures of Mr Connolly wearing the T-shirt were then posted online and received large amounts of attention - leading Miss Bartlett to worry it could have the opposite effect and attract girls who 'like a challenge'.

But the couple, who have a five-year-old daughter and live together in Newcastle, have laughed off the publicity and are treating the incident as a joke.

Miss Bartlett said: 'When I took it in to the printing shop and explained what I wanted I swear they must have thought I was a psycho.

Together: Miss Bartlett spoke of her fears that the t-shirt's fame online may attract women to her boyfriend

'Leon wasn't expecting it, I had mentioned that I would make him a t-shirt but didn't think I actually would.

'He saw the funny side of it because it is really just a joke, he and I have a really similar sense of humour.

'He ended up laughing about it and even posed for pictures wearing it.' 

Abbie, a criminology student at Northumbria University, said: 'Leon said he definitely will wear it in Ibiza now because he's practically famous, but I think it might have the opposite effect.

'Now that everyone has seen it online I think it might just attract loads of girls... some girls like a challenge.' 

'I have absolutely no reason to be jealous or possessive because I know Leon would never cheat on me.

'We met when we were really young and have been together ever since. I trust him completely and we've been on separate holidays before, that's just how our relationship works, we do our own thing.'

'Trust him completely': Miss Bartlett has said both she and her boyfriend consider the shirt a joke

'Just how our relationship is': Mr Bartlett said the two of them always take separate holidays

Mr Bartlett, who is in a band called Good Friend and works in a warehouse, left Newcastle on three days ago for a festival in Ireland and flies out to Ibiza this Friday.

He said: 'At first I thought is she serious? She wanted me to wear it to all the big clubs like Pacha etc.

'But now I get that it's a joke I'm happy enough to go along with it, that's just how our relationship is it's just silly.

'People have been saying that wearing the t-shirt might attract girls, some girls will definitely take it as some sort off challenge.

'I just have to laugh about it, Abbie is the only girl for me an we both know that!'
