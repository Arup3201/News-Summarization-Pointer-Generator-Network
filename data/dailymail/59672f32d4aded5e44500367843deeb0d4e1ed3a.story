A luxury car salesman knew something smelled fishy when a customer paid him in AUD$17,063.38 (SGD$18,997.28) in stinking coins.

Last Tuesday, Ong Boon Lin, 34, entered Exotic Motor, a shop specialising in Ferraris and Bentleys, pushing a white box on a trolley.

Things took a turn for the weird when he toppled the box over, covering the  shop in a mountain of coins - all of which reportedly reeked of fish.

Mr Lin, 34, lost a lawsuit against the dealership over money he claimed was owed to him over an Aston Martin V8 Vantage he bought from Exotic Motor, a luxury car dealership in Singapore.

The court ordered he repay the car's road tax and insurance, as well as reimburse the shop for legal fees, reports Stuff NZ.

So in a statement of disapproval over the decision, Mr Bin paid the money he was owed in about 100 kilograms of smelly coins, from numerous different currencies.

The coins were valued at 10, 20 and 50 cents, with some from Malaysia and Thailand.

The car dealership's workers were left to  pack the money into about ten bags, which were then carted into a car boot - but not without leaving an overwhelmingly fishy odour that's not likely to go away soon.

The owner of the shop, Tang Siu Tong, said: 'The coins were soaked in market juices, and smelled of fish. It stank up the whole place and I had to hire professionals to get rid of it. But the smell is still there.'

'I am keeping the coins in 10 separate bags ... My lawyers are arranging to have it returned, I am definitely not going to accept it.'

The owner of Exotic Motor, Tang Siu Tong, said the shop still smelt awful despite showing his dealership in air fresheners for three days. He believes he may even have to replace the carpet

Media Corp reported that the shop still smelled awful after three days of using air fresheners, and they are now considering replacing the carpet, which will cost him $4000.

Mr Tong also claimed the coin dumping incident has seen him lose  80 per cent of his customers.

Mr Lin's lawyer had allegedly told the shop his client would drop off the money that day.

The 34 year old businessman says he doesn't see anything wrong with his method of payment. He told local tabloid The New Paper that he did it because he was upset with the shop.

'Was it too much? I was really unhappy with his business practice and I paid the amount in full. So, no,' Mr Lin said.

Under Singapore's Currency Laws, coins of a denomination smaller than 50 cents can only be payed for an amount of up to $2, while only $1 dollar coins and larger can be used for a bigger sum.
