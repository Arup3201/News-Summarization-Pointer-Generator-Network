Going to the fridge to butter some toast, a woman was shocked by what she found crawling among her groceries.

Staring back at her was an exotic spider, believed to have travelled more than 6,000 miles from India in a box of grapes.

Beverley Cooper, 52, screamed when she saw the two-inch female Indian wolf spider, which experts believe is pregnant, in the fridge at her home in Glenrothes, Fife in Scotland.

Friend in the fridge: Beverley Cooper found this Indian wolf spider in her fridge. Experts believe the female spider is likely to be pregnant and travelled more than 6,000 miles from India

Her husband David Cooper, 60, rushed downstairs and caught the spider, capable of giving a nasty bite, in a glass before calling the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).

The female spider is now living at the Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World.

Mr Cooper, a former schoolteacher, said: 'I heard my wife screaming and when I went to see what was wrong I discovered the spider sitting on the wall of the fridge. It was odd looking and I immediately knew it wasn't a normal house spider.

‘I think being in the cold had slowed it down as it wasn't moving very quickly and was relatively easy to catch.

‘I thought it would jump at first, but it was quite lethargic from being in the fridge.

'I'm really glad the spider has found a new home as it's certainly been through quite a journey, wherever it came from.'

Mrs Cooper, a co-ordinator with Fife Council said: ‘I got a huge shock. I think all of Glenrothes heard me screaming.

‘It was 11pm and David was feeling peckish so I went to the fridge to get bread and butter for toast.

‘As soon as the light went on I saw 
this hairy spider staring back at me. It looked enormous to me and I 
just started screaming.

‘It was like no spider I’d seen 
before as it was hairy and had big beady eyes, like a tarantula. But I 
didn’t want to squash it. I don’t like to kill anything but it would 
also have made a horrible mess of my fridge.’

SPCA animal rescue officer Kieran Smart said: 'The spider was found in the fridge, next to a box of grapes which originated from India, so the chances are it has come home in the Cooper's shopping.'

Andrew McDonald, general manager of Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World said: ‘We think the spider could be pregnant.

‘It is hard to tell with a small spider, but we are pretty sure it is.’

Kevin Thom, from Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World, said: ‘This spider isn't deadly but if (someone was) bitten, it would leave a real sting. 

‘Although it's not much bigger than the average house spider, it definitely isn't from Britain.

‘It has different markings and, unlike house spiders, its eyes are at the front of its head, helping it to hunt and escape danger.’

Found all over the world, Wolf spiders venom is not deadly to humans but can cause mild pain and swelling.

While the wolf spider has a lifespan of no more than two or three years, it is hoped that the new female will contribute to a new generation of the spiders at the centre.

Mr Macdonald said: ‘We think we will have this spider for maybe 12 to 18 months, but hopefully we will keep the offspring and have another generation.’

Anyone who finds an exotic creature such as this should call the SPCA Animal Helpline on 03000 999 999.
