This is the adorable moment two bears were seen greeting each other with a friendly hand shake.

After spotting each other from a distance, the two siblings ran through shallow waters to take part in some much needed playtime.

But whilst snapping the two in action, Russian wildlife photographer Sergey Ivanov, 52, managed to capture the pair seemingly shaking hands.

Nice to see you: Russian wildlife photographer, Sergey Ivanov, 52, managed to capture the pair seemingly shaking hands

Pictured at the Kuril Lake in the 
Kronotsy Nature Reserve, in Russia's remote far east, the brother and sister spent the next 
few hours practising their fishing skills together.

Mr Ivanov said: 'Brown bears are my favourite animals and I visit Kamchatka almost every year to watch and photograph them.

'They spotted each other from across the water and ran to greet each other, they were very excitable.

'During
 their play wrestling, I managed to get a picture of them shaking hands,
 it was really amusing looking back at the pictures.

'It
 was a really great experience to watch them play, you could tell they 
had a really strong bond and that they were the best of friends.'
