A spurned lover is facing jail after being charged for taking revenge on his ex by putting out sex adverts for her address on Craigslist - relentlessly attracting dozens of men from across the country.

Kenneth Kuban, 61, an employee at the Library of Congress, has been accused of felony stalking after posting the 'Casual Encounters' adverts on the website, according to Smoking Gun.

He is accused of directing men to the 64-year-old woman's Virginia home, posting pictures of her and details of her address.

According to police, she was soon inundated with men - some from out of state - looking for the 'senior lady' mentioned in the post.

Kuban is accused of posing as his ex in email exchanges with the 'visitors'.

He wrote he was a 'senior lady' seeking to 'meet a gentleman in his 50s that can give me some pleasuring.'

The harassment got so bad the woman was forced to install security fences and cameras to ward the men off, according to officers.

Police also reported being called out on multiple occasions to 'chase away the men who had been enticed by these personal ads'.

The unidentified victim also put signs up outside her house warning any 'visitors' they were trespassing if they were responding to Craigslist adverts.

She reported the incidents to police and undercover officers posed as interested men to investigate the advert source.

In exchanges through the site they were told to park by the woman's mailbox and she would meet them.

Police claim the harassment began when the woman brought her six month relationship with Kuban to an end.

The woman previously attempted to get restraining orders against Kuban over the Craigslist posts, according to officers.

The police report states the ads led to 'random men, often traveling from other States, to appear at [the victim's] property, looking to have sexual relations with her'.

It added: '[The woman] spends a good portion of her time searching Craigslist and ‘flagging’ these ads as inappropriate.'

Kuban's work computer was seized by investigators as part of their search for evidence.

He works as a preservationist at the Library of Congress’s facility in Culpeper, Virginia, according to the police report.

He was arrested on Friday and is next due in court on April 1, if convicted he faces up to five years in prison.
