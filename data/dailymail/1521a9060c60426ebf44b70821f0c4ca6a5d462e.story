Police in California are asking for the public's help in finding a former member of the Harlem Globetrotters, 37-year-old Rico Omarr Harris, who went missing more than a week ago while driving to Seattle to visit his girlfriend.

Harris was last heard from October 10 when he called his mother from the road to tell he was passing through Sacramento and was about to stop for breakfast and a nap.

Three days later, Harris' black Nissan sedan was discovered abandoned 60 miles northwest of Sacramento in a remote park off State Route 16. The former basketball player was nowhere to be found.
