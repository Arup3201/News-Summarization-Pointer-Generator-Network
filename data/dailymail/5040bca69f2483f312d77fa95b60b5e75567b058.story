We may think of vanity as a quintessentially human trait - but these photographs show that the animal world can be just as self-obsessed.

When this penguin in the Antarctic caught sight of its reflection in a pool of water, it stood staring at itself for a whole 10 minutes.

It paraded up and down the edge of the pool in the inlet of Neko Harbour - and although it repeatedly turned to leave, it kept rushing back to admire itself again.

Vain: This penguin spent 10 minutes admiring its reflection in a pool of water in Neko Harbour, Antarctica

Intrigued: The bird appeared to be absolutely fascinated with the sight of itself in the water

Rare: It is unusual to get 'mirror calm' conditions because of the Antarctic's stormy weather

Anthony Pierce, the photographer who captured the remarkable snaps, said: 'The penguin was standing there for at least 10 minutes in total.

'It was turning its head from side to side and looking itself up and down repeatedly. It was actually looking itself in the eye sometimes.

'Some of the other penguins came to the water's edge, but they just drank some water from the pool and moved on. None of them looked at their reflection.

'Then the vain penguin came along. I was quite surprised by its behaviour.'

Obsessive: The penguin kept walking away and then returning to look at itself once more

Fascinated: Other penguins went to the pool to drink, but did not stop to stare at themselves

He added: 'It almost seemed to have a bit of a strut as it left.

'Penguins are amazing animals. They have enormous character and personality on camera, which always makes for interesting photographs.

'They are also incredibly tough and resilient creatures; surviving in one of the harshest environments on earth.'

Mr Pierce said that it was rare to see such a sight, because the conditions in the Antarctic are usually so windy that pools are almost never 'mirror calm'.

Handsome? The penguin derived endless entertainment from the sight of itself

Strut: The penguin appeared pleased when it finally walked away, according to photographer Anthony Pierce

He said: 'It's really unusual to have perfect conditions like this. There has to be no breeze at all for a reflection shot like this to work.

'I can't ever remember seeing an animal take such an interest in its reflection before.

'It was a fantastic experience to witness this behaviour.'
