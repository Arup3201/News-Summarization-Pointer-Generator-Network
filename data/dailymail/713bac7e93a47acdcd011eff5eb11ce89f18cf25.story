A 21-year-old student not only survived a potentially life-threatening injury after snapping her ankle and becoming stranded while hiking on a mountain, but she also produced a hilarious video of her ordeal while waiting to be rescued.

Alexandra 'Lexi' De Forest, of Fort Collins, Colorado, forced herself to stay calm and incredibly focused on comedy while coping with the excruciating pain after falling while hiking in Wyoming last Saturday.

Attempting to jump over a large trench the brunette slipped, shattered her ankle and was left stranded on the mountainside unable to move.

As her companion rushed to find help, the Colorado State University senior made the video diary on her phone to distract herself from the horrifying prospect of dying alone in the wilderness.

Staying positive: Lexi De Forest snapped her ankle while hiking in Wyoming last Saturday. Rather than panicking, the pretty brunette made a hilarious video diary until her rescuers arrived

‘Speaking out loud and my 
stream-of-consciousness settled me,’ she told FoxNews. 'I was talking 
about my loved ones and my dog. Anything to keep me from staring at my 
ankle. It was pretty gross.'

De Forest had earlier set off on a camping trip to Vedauwoo mountain with her friend Erik 
Henry and they had managed to watch the sun go down from the top of a nearby rock 
formation.

After the sun had set, the pair were marching on to a nearby campsite when they
 came across a trench eight-feet-deep and six-feet-across.

'So, this is me. I just broke my ankle. Eww. For the second time now come on, Lexi, you’d think you’d be better at this by now…this walking thing.'

'This is me moving my foot, and it's 
really gross. I'd show you more but if I looked at it, I might vomit on 
myself. And no one wants to see that.'

'I am really scared. But in, like, the calmest, coolest sense.'

'I’m not going to tell you how scared I am of bears right now.'

'Big shout out to my fam.'

'I have made a lot of good decisions…was one them probably 
wasn’t jumping over that trench.'

'Optimism is key'

After Henry successfully leaped across the trench, it was De Forest’s turn.

But as she prepared to jump she slipped and fell in.

The student admitted
 to a brief moment of panic when she first saw her detached ankle. 

‘I felt blood all over me, my knees and elbows were cut, and my plan 
immediately was to crawl down the mountain,’ she told FoxNews.

But that plan came unstuck when crawling proved too painful. Henry then tried
 to carry his injured companion down the mountainside but became too 
exhausted to carry on.

At 8pm, with night quickly setting in, Henry rushed off to find help.

Now left alone De Forest refused to panic and instead began documenting her terrifying ordeal on her phone.

The footage starts with a shot of De Forest’s foot completely twisted round with blood running down her trainers.

‘So, this is me. I just broke my ankle. Eww. For the second time now’, she begins the film, ‘like, come on, Lexi, you’d think you’d be better at this by now… this walking thing.’

Trying to forget the excruciating pain and frightening situation, De Forest talks to the camera nonstop for almost seven minutes as she waits to be rescued. 

Ouch! Lexi showed the backwards angle her foot was in after she fell while trying to jump over a trench

Inspirational: Aron Ralston, left, became trapped under a boulder while hiking in a remote Utah canyon, he freed himself by sawing off his right arm below the elbow with a small utility knife. James Frano, right, played Ralston in Danny Boyle's film of the incredible feat, 127 Hours

‘This is me moving my foot, and it's really gross. I'd show you more but if I looked at it, I might vomit on myself. And no one wants to see that.

'I don’t know first aid for a foot that is not attached to your ankle so I’m doing the best I can,’ she jokes. 

But at one point the student admits to just how petrified she is: ‘I am ******* scared. I am really scared. But in, like, the calmest, coolest sense.

‘I’m not going to tell you how scared I am of bears right now,’ she continues, flashing her pearly whites with a laugh.

Referencing her agony only a few times, De Forest desperately focuses on other things, giving shout outs to her friends and family, as well as describing her surroundings.

When she spots the lights of her rescuers in the distance she whoops and cheers before reminding herself that ‘optimism is key.’

At one point she even breaks into song – recounting how she can still feel her toes.

Admirers: Lexi has become an internet sensation and won a legion of admirers after posting a YouTube video of her terrifying ordeal

Stranded: Lexi spent an hour alone unable to move on the Vedauwoo mountainside while her friend rushed to get help

Continuing to joke and stay positive,
 she says: ‘I have made a lot of good decisions…was one them probably 
wasn’t jumping over that trench.’

De Forest was stuck on the mountainside alone for an hour and, as the video ends at 9pm, her rescuers arrive.

She was airlifted to the Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland, Colorado and was released on Wednesday night.

Her ordeal echoes the incredible story
 of ‘127 hours’ hiker Aron Ralston, who was forced to saw off his own 
arm after it was trapped under a bolder for five days.

And, as she recovers from the fall, De Forest can take solace that the inspirational video has won her a legion of online admirers.

While many praise her positive attitude, others compliment her beauty – focusing in on her perfect teeth.

‘I think this lady should be endorsing some sort of dentistry product. What perfect teeth!’ one user comments on Gawker.

One
 commentator posted on the Reddit website, ‘Wow, not only a bad ass but 
super gorgeous’ while another simply writes: ‘10/10. Would marry.’

However, the hiker is currently off the market as she has started dating Henry, her heroic rescuer.

Since she posted the video onto YouTube on Wednesday, it has been seen more than 21,000 times.

Beneath the video De Forest writes: 'Just hanging out on top of a mountain. At night. Alone. With a broken ankle. No biggie.'

MailOnline has reached out to De Forest for comment.
