This photographer has ignored all warnings about playing with her food, instead creating a set of unusual scenes that bring peanuts to life.

Nailia Schwarz, a Russian artist now based in Speyer, Germany, uses nuts to recreate everyday scenes including swimming lessons, walking the dog, avoiding a rain shower, and gardening.

The results are stunning, somehow capturing the spirit of each individual nut, with each scene taking several hours to set up and photograph.

Ms Schwarz came up with the idea after spotting other works of food art on the internet. She says she chose peanuts 'because they have character; you can see when looking at a peanut if it will be good for a dog, or a man'.

To create the scenes she first searches through a bag 
of peanuts to find those that have character or look like they have a 
certain type of body language. Once she has selected the nuts to use, it
 is simply a case of adding props, such as wire for body parts.

The
 peanuts are snapped using special lighting, before the 
photographer makes slight touch-ups using photo editing software.

Nut the weather we were hoping for: Two adult peanuts hold umbrellas in the rain while their child appears to be enjoying the puddles

Chilling out: This poor peanut is carrying a load of chillies in a backpack made from the bottle lid. Ms Schwarz said she first came across food art on the internet

Shells of themselves: There's a strange sadness to the peanuts in this picture, as they are seen separated by a large pane of glass

Bunny nuts: These peanuts appear to be dressed as Easter rabbits while dropping off eggs. The peanut on the right looks to be growing impatient with his friend

Nut going far: These peanuts are going to struggle to get the boulder (represented here by an orange) anywhere, as they're pushing in opposite directions

Ouch: These peanuts are using a cheese grater as a slide. The pile of nut shell beneath the grater seems to suggest using it for the activity may not be the best idea

Who broke it? This nut looks unimpressed by the broken ornament at its feet. The vase is made from a walnut, but all Ms Schwarz's 'human' figures are peanuts

The results are stunning, somehow capturing the spirit of each individual nut, with each scene taking several hours to set up and photograph

Inspired: Ms Schwarz came up with the idea after spotting other works of food art on the internet. She says she chose peanuts 'because they have character'
