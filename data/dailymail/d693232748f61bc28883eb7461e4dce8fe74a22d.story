Amanda Knox's best friend is so convinced of the innocence of the convicted murderer that she has moved to Italy to be by her side.

Madison Paxton has spoken candidly about her regular visits to her 'confidante' in jail and revealed that they sometimes can do nothing but 'hug and cry'.

Knox is serving 26 years in jail for the brutal knife murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found semi naked and with her throat cut.

Victim: English student Meredith Kercher was found murdered in November 2007

After her conviction in December 2009, 
Knox wrote to Paxton to tell her of her plans if her appeal was 
successful - 'ride my bike through Seattle, get married, have children'.

But if her appeal was unsuccessful, Knox said she planned to 'get a few degrees, work as a translator', Paxton revealed.Â 

Last November, Paxton, 24, moved 5,000 
miles from Seattle to Italy to be close to her friend, and she now has a
job as a photographer on a local newspaper.

In an interview with Grazia, Paxton revealed that Knox is keeping busy in jail by studying foreign languages, singing in a choir and learning to play the guitar - but she often breaks down.

'On Amanda's down days there's little I can do. We just hug, cry and thank each other for existing.'

She also told how despite Knox, nicknamed 'Foxy Knoxy', receiving 'bundles' of letters of support and marriage proposals from strangers, there is a 'stigma' attached to being friends with the convicted murderer.

'Strangers have spat in our friends' faces and I've received abusive Facebook messages,' Paxton said.

Lawyers for Amanda Knox are battling to block a TV film about the murder of Meredith Kercher being shown it Italy before the American exchange student's appeal later this year.

Amanda Knox: Murder On Trial In Italy was broadcast in the U.S. in February, despite legal objections, but now there is a fight on to stop distribution of the film, which sees Heroes actress Hayden Panettiere portraying Knox and playing an active part in the terrible events.

In the disturbing footage, Meredith is seen being held down on the floor by Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who was convicted of murder with her and Rudy Guede, who was found guilty at an earlier trial.

Knox's lawyers claim the film amounts to 'character assassination' of their client and Sollecito, and have even asked for the trailer to be removed from YouTube.

The trailer opens with a scene of Knox at home in Seattle surrounded by her father Curt and mother Edda Mellas as they give her a champagne send off as she begins a year abroad in the Italian town of Perugia.

It then cuts to her meeting Sollecito at a concert and shows the start of their relationship before switching to a police chief who tells a press conference: 'This was a sex game... Amanda orchestrated the attack.'

He then adds: 'Under the angel face, she is capable of anything.'

The film, which has been slammed as 'horrific' by Meredith's parents, was shot in Rome during October and November after officials in Perugia denied filmmakers access.

Paxton also revealed how the guards in the prison where Knox is being held seem 'sympathetic' towards her plight.

'They sometimes give us chocolate as we chat,' Paxton said.

Knox was found guilty after a 
year-long trial, but in recent weeks there has been growing unease over 
the strength of the evidence used to convict her and fellow accused 
Raffaele Sollecito, 27.

Last
week a DNA report drawn up by two independent experts said that DNA 
found on a 30cm kitchen knife recovered form Sollecito's flat 'could not
be attributed with certainty to Meredith Kercher.'

The
report went on to say there was a serious possibility that evidence had
been contaminated and that proper internationally recognised procedures
when collating and examining evidence had not been followed.

Knox was given the news by fellow inmates at Capanne jail, near Perugia, after they saw the revelations on television.

Clapping and cheering, inmates crowded round her - with many also embracing her and telling her it was only a matter of time before she was released.

Knox's appeal will resume at the end of July.

The damning report does mean chances of her being freed on appeal have risen significantly, although its claims must still be discussed in court and any decision is unlikely until the autumn.

'I hope more than anything that come September we can be roommates... But first we must prove she didn't kill her last one,' Paxton said.

Meanwhile, lawyers for Knox have launched a legal bid to block a TV film about the murder of Meredith Kercher being shown outside the U.S. to prevent it scuppering the pending appeal.

It has been claimed by lawyers that the film, which stars Hayden Panettiere as Knox, amounts to 'character assassination' of Knox and Sollecito, who is also appealing his murder conviction.

A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing.

He was handed a 30-year sentence - later cut to 16 years - for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008.
