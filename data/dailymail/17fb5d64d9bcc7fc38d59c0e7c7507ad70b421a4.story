 Robin Williams and his second wife Marsha were living apart in 2008 when the comedic genius fell head over heels for a stunning blonde artist named Charlotte Filbert.

She was 27, he was 56.

Now Charlotte is among the millions mourning his death. Choked up and close to tears, she told MailOnline: 'It’s very, very sad. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.'

'I have my own family now, I just had a baby, and I am thinking about his family.'

Heartbroken: Robin Williams' ex-girlfriend, artist Charlotte Filbert, began seeing the revered actor after he and his wife Marsha stopped living together. She was close to tears when she spoke to MailOnline

Separation: : Williams and Marsha had been struggling to save their marriage for two years and had quietly decided to separate on New Year's Eve 2007. He met Charlotte the following year

Asked when she had last spoken to Williams, she would only repeat: 'All I really want to say is that my thoughts and prayers are with his family.'

Robin Williams was introduced to Charlotte through designer Tommy Hilfiger’s socialite daughter Ally.

In November 2007, rumors swirled that Williams was seeing Ally, then 23, when he was spotted leaving her home. But it later transpired he was actually seeing her pal Charlotte.

Robin and Charlotte became close through their shared love of art. The actor bought several of her paintings. He wooed her with romantic dinners and walks along the beach with her dog.

According to The National Enquirer, that broke the story of their affair at the time, Robin gave Charlotte a $10,000-a-month allowance to rent a swanky apartment in Manhattan.

A year 
later, Ally spent the evening with Robin and Charlotte when they rocked up at
 a Manhattan comedy club after attending a nearby art gallery opening.

The
 New York Post’s Page Six gossip column reported that Williams did an 
impromptu stand-up session at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater on 
West 26th Street.

'He showed up with no prior notice. This is the second time in as many months he’s just popped in,' a source at the club said.

A few monthes after Charlotte and Robin connected, photographers in Paris spotted him with his wife Marsha and their two children Zelda, then teenaged Zelda and Cody on vacation in March 2008.  

'He seemed distracted. He wasn’t his usual self,' one told People magazine.

'Usually when he sees a camera he's playful. This time he was really quiet, just glum.'

The reason behind the miserable vacation became clear days later, when back home in San Francisco Marsha filed for divorce after 19 years of marriage citing 'irreconcilable differences'.

Williams, who was married to first wife Valerie when he hired Marsha as their son Zach's nanny, was by then deeply involved with Charlotte.

Sources revealed that Williams and Marsha has been struggling to save their marriage for two years and had quietly decided to separate on New Year's Eve 2007.

When contacted by the Enquirer about the affair in April 2008, Charlotte said: 'I can’t comment on any of this stuff.'

Neither did she deny the relationship with Robin to MailOnline.

The relationship with Charlotte, who comes from a well-to-do Maryland family, eventually fizzled out and Robin married third wife, graphic designer Susan Schneider, in 2011.

Charlotte later opened an art studio in East Hampton, NY before moving to South Carolina in 2012.

Last year she married fellow artist and furniture designer Benjamin Caldwell, 30, in the Florida Keys.

She and Caldwell, who is friends with Lady Gaga and has worked on art projects with her, recently welcomed their own baby.
