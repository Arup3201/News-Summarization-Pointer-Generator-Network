Hero: Veteran Thomas Wells, 94, has been called to the French Embassy in London where he will receive the Legion d'Honneur for bravely helping soldiers and civilians during the evacuation of Dunkirk

A soldier who risked his life saving others at Dunkirk beach during the Second World War has won one of the most prestigious military honours in the world.

Veteran Thomas Wells, 94, has been called to the French Embassy in London, where he will receive the Legion d’Honneur for his wartime service to the French.

The retired North East Ambulance Service instructor, who lives in Walkergate in Newcastle, treated French and Belgian civilians and soldiers during the evacuation of Dunkirk as shells rained down around him.

After treating the wounded, the young Royal Army Medical Corps soldier  used his helmet as a paddle on a rowing boat, only just managing to get himself to safety on an English merchant navy ship in the English Channel.

'When you’re a medic you treat anyone, it doesn’t matter whose army,' he said. 'That’s the Geneva Convention.'

'It was the civilians I felt sorry for, they had to leave their homes with all with their bags on their backs and they were at risk of being gunned down too and many were.'

'For three days we were paddling out back and forth with our helmets on this rowing boat. We were getting shelled all the time.

'We had just made it onto the merchant ship when a bomb went down the funnel and killed the man sitting next to me.'

His escape at Dunkirk followed a gruelling eight day walk by foot from Brussels with 149 Northumbrian Field Ambulance service, who he had joined in 1937.

Yet just two years later the great-grandad was captured while serving in North Africa and, after a spell in an Italian prison camp, escaped a German camp in the dead of night - on a bicycle.

Between 1942 and 1945 he was held at the German prisoner of war camp, where he was forced to break down tonnes of granite a day in a quarry.

Brave: Mr Well's regiment, the 149 Northumbrian Field Ambulance

Stoic: As well as his brave service at Normandy, Mr Wells also spent three years in a German prisoner of war camp. He escaped on a bicycle and was found by American troops

One night after he finished his shift and was being moved back to camp he managed to sneak off and spotted the bike against a wall.

He said: 'Someone must have been looking down on my that night. It wasn’t planned I just saw it and rode off for five or six miles in the pitch black in the direction of shelling which I thought must be the Americans.

Membership in the Legion d'Honneur is restricted to French nationals and Foreign nationals who have served France or the ideals it upholds.

However, foreigners may receive a distinction of the Legion.

Famous
 British recipients include Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Prince 
Charles, Prince of Wales and the late Lord Mountbatten, author Graham 
Greene, actor Laurence Olivier and Sir Stuart Bell MP.

'They took me in and I was sent back to England with malnutrition. For years I’d been a prisoner of war and the next day I am back at an American hospital being treated in Swindon.

'It was mind over matter back then - there was nothing for post traumatic stress.'

Humble at 
receiving his honour from the French, he said he will accept it as a 
representative of all who served with him during his time in the army.

He
 said: 'I feel like I’m a custodian of 149 Field Ambulance. This is for 
us collectively because the men were all brilliant.

'We lost a lot of 
lads as well.'

He married his late wife Joan in 1947 and went on to have son Alan, 67, and also has two grandsons and four great-grandchildren.

He
 will travel down to London on Wednesday June 18 with his son to receive
 his Chevalier rank in the Ordre National de la Legion d’Honneur for his
 involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.

Home to happiness: He married his late wife Joan in 1947. Mr Wells is accepting the award on behalf of the men he served with

Men wait in an orderly fashion for their turn to be rescued during the evacuation of Dunkirk. Thousands of seaworthy vessels in Britain, from Channel ferries to fishing boats, private yachts to sailing dinghies, crossed the Channel to bring the men home

After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to help defend France.

In May 1940, three German Panzer corps attacked France through the Ardennes and quickly advanced to the English Channel.

By May 21, the German forces had trapped the BEF and the remains of the French and Belgian armies in an area along the northern coast of France.

The British force retreated to Dunkirk as it was the best site for an evacuation and the Battle of Dunkirk raged between May 26 and June 4 1940.

However, in one of the most bizarre military manoeuvres of the war, the Nazis halted their final advance.

This gave the allies three days to plan their escape and arrange the evacuation of 330,000 troops.

Described as a 'miracle of deliverance' by wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, the evacuation is seen as one of several events in 1940 that determined the eventual outcome of the war.

The mission, dubbed Operation Dynamo, saw hosts of pleasure boats and other small craft join warships to rescue the stranded troops, who had been pushed back by Axis forces.
