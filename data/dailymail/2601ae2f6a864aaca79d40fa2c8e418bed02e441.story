Fake rape: Kelly Wilson, 29, pictured, was arrested on July 3 and charged with second degree falsely reporting an incident, making a false statement and misusing 911

A Connecticut woman slashed her body with a steak knife and choked herself with a metal dog collar before falsely claiming to police that she was raped by a masked intruder - all so her military boyfriend could visit her.

Kelly Wilson, 29, was arrested on July 3 and charged with second degree falsely reporting an incident, making a false statement and misusing 911 after she called the emergency line begging for help on April 14.

When officers arrived at her Suffield home, they found her lying on the floor 'visibly upset and crying' with a bruised eye and 'cuts all over her body.'

According to the Hartford Courant, Wilson told police a man wearing a ski mask had twice knocked on her door that evening, telling her his truck had broken down and asking for money. She said he came back a third time with a handgun and broke into the house then sexually assaulted her.

In subsequent interviews she padded out the story, telling detectives the man forced her to shower for 30 minutes after the rape, presumably to explain the lack of seminal evidence.

When police became suspicious, they called in an FBI profiler and a medical examiner to check out her injuries. Both believed her story didn't stack up.

Shortly after, Wilson admitted it was all an elaborate lie she had concocted in an effort to have her boyfriend granted leave from the military so he could visit her in hospital.

Investigation: Police quizzed motorists and searched the house for evidence after the report in April

On May 22, Wilson gave a seven page statement saying the home invasion and rape never occurred.

She said she had been missing her boyfriend who was out of the state at a military training camp so she took four 'pain pills' then drank a bottle of wine.

On a previous occasion, her boyfriend had been given a one-month leave when she had gallbladder surgery so she 'had to come up with something sensational and believable' to get him home again, she told police.

She decided on the false rape, and cut herself all over her body with a steak knife and choked herself with a dog collar to 'make it more convincing,' according to her statement.

She then showered, hit herself in the eye with the head of the shower and messed up her home to make it look like she had tried to fight off the intruder.

After her false report, local and state police issued a description of the fake intruder provided by Wilson and officers quizzed motorists near her property, asking if they'd witnessed anything.

Her neighbors, frightened at the thought of sexual predator on the loose, inundated the department with calls for weeks to flag up safety concerns, police said.

Wilson is free on $50,000 bond and is scheduled to be arraigned in Enfield Superior Court next week.
