Mario Balotelli joined his team-mates in training for the second time at Melwood on Thursday as they await who they will face in the UEFA Champions League group stage following a five-year exile from the competition.

The Reds will be dreaming for a repeat of their European success in Istanbul in 2005 when they fought back from three goals down to finally get the better of AC Milan on penalties, in what will go down as one of the most memorable European finals of all time.

And the £16million addition of maverick forward Balotelli will give manager Brendan Rodgers renewed hope his side can cope without Luis Suarez and compete for major honours on the domestic and European stage this season.

The only member of that famous Istanbul line-up who remains at the club is skipper Steven Gerrard, who of course played a crucial role in the fightback on the night - reducing the scoreline to 3-1 just after the interval. 

And while Gerrard and the rest of his team-mates look ahead fondly to the draw, which could potentially put the Reds in a group of death alongside Real Madrid, PSG and Roma, the only thing on the 34-year-old's mind currently is for the Reds to avenge the defeat suffered at the hands of champions Manchester City on Monday night.

He told www.liverpoolfc.com:'It's going to be very tough. Tottenham away is a difficult match. They've started the season really well, have a new manager and have their confidence and belief back. 

Optimistic: Brendan Rodgers will be hoping the addition of Balotelli, as well as the experience of his skipper, will result in his side having a productive season

'We'll have to perform at our maximum to get the result we want, but we're going to go there for three points and we're confident we can get them.'

Gerrard also believes the future is bright at Anfield despite the departure of Luis Suarez this summer adding : 'The manager has strengthened in other areas and we've also recently signed Mario Balotelli, so hopefully the new signings along with everyone who has been here for a long time can help show everyone there is life after Luis and we'll try and fight to try and be successful without him.'

The Reds have three points from their first two Premier League games after edging past Southampton on the opening day before being brushed aside by Manuel Pellegrini's City side 3-1 following a dominant second-half display at the Etihad.

Balotelli is set for his Reds debut at White Hart Lane on Sunday as they look to end Tottenham's 100% start to the season.
