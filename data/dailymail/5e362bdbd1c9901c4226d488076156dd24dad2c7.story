This is the shocking moment a man was caught on CCTV leading two young girls into a hotel for sex.

The appalling video was shown during the trial of eight men who were yesterday jailed in Derby for a total of 42 years for preying on girls aged 13 to 15, picked up from care homes and the streets.

The vile men, aged between 35 and 60, slept with the girls in exchange for as little as £5, cigarettes, drugs, mobile phones and treats - including a child’s toy and rides on a farmer’s tractor.

Shocking: John Shaw, 54, is caught on CCTV with two girls at a hotel - one of whom is carrying a teddy bear

Anthony Lambert, 51, Stefan Godfrey, 
44, John Shaw, 55, Ijaz Ahmed, 35, and Mark Adaoui, 40, Colin Simpson, 
55, David Shardlow, 56, and Ian Yeoman, 60, were jailed for a series
of sex offences.

The problem of teen prostitution in 
the city suburbs of Normanton and Pear Tree was so rife, one girl 
distressingly said that she thought taking money for sex simply ‘must 
be part of growing up’.

Disturbing CCTV footage played during the five-week trial showed one of the men, Shaw, checking into a Jurys Inn hotel with one girl and her friend, who could be seen clutching a large teddy bear.

Shaw, who lives in a caravan on a farm in Kniveton, Derbyshire, was found guilty of paying the same girl for sexual activity on two occasions at Sinfin golf course, near Derby, when she was 15.

He was found not guilty of assaulting 
the girl when she told him she did not want to have sex with him and he 
was jailed for four years and 11 months. The video footage of Shaw was 
from 2010.

'The message that crimes such as this are happening in Derby and Derbyshire is getting out to the public'

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Stokes

Five victims were involved in the case
but it is thought up to 15 girls may have been targeted for sex in 2009
and 2010. The men did not know each other, and carried out their 
activities individually.

They were all caught by officers under
Operation Kern, which targeted those seeking the services of children 
for sex. Five of the men, including Shaw, had denied the charges.

Married Mark Adaoui, 40, from Derby, 
was found guilty of paying a 15-year-old girl on two occasions to 
perform a sex act on him in his car. He brought cannabis along and they 
smoked it together. He was jailed for seven years.

Stefan Godfrey, 44, from Pinxton, 
Derbyshire, was convicted by jury of paying a different 15-year-old girl
on two occasions for sex knowing or believing she was underage. He was 
jailed for six years.

'You did not only take advantage of these vulnerable girls, you did so to satisfy your middle-aged desires to have sex with them and you were prepared to pay the paltry sums they charged'

Judge John Gosling

Ijaz Ahmed, 35, from Derby, was found 
guilty of paying two different girls for sex when they were 15. He was 
jailed for six years.

Anthony Lambert, 51, from Derby, was 
found guilty of paying for sex twice with the same girl. She said she 
drank alcohol, smoked cannabis, ate a kebab and watched a film at his 
house. He also gave her money towards a new mobile phone. He was jailed 
for six years.

Colin Simpson, 55, from Worksop, had 
previously pleaded guilty to three charges of paying for sexual services
of a 15-year-old girl. He was jailed for four years.

David Shardlow, 56, from Derby, 
pleaded guilty to nine counts of paying for sexual services of two girls
aged 15 and possessing indecent images of children. He was also jailed 
for four years.

Ian Yeoman, 60, from Derby, had 
also previously confessed to 12 counts of paying for sexual services of 
two different 15-year-old girls. He was jailed for four years and eight 
months.

Sentencing the men, Judge John Gosling
said: ‘In recent times and recent years in this country, we have begun 
to realise how the extent of the sexual abuse of children is becoming 
more prevalent.’

He distanced the crimes to similar 
ones in 2010, when 13 men were jailed for up to 22 years for a total of 
70 offences in a police investigation known as Operation Retriever.

'I am not dealing with a team of predators and there are no allegations that they forced themselves on the girls.

'But you did not only take advantage 
of these vulnerable girls, you did so to satisfy your middle-aged 
desires to have sex with them and you were prepared to pay the paltry 
sums they charged.'

Speaking outside court, Detective 
Chief Inspector Andy Stokes said police were ‘really pleased’ with the 
outcome - in part because the victims ‘have now seen justice and 
closure’ on what happened to them.

He added: 'The convictions have come about due to the tremendous work the investigating team did. The message that crimes such as this are happening in Derby and Derbyshire is getting out to the public, raising their awareness.'

In victim impact statements read out 
in the court Mark Achurch, prosecuting, said one of the girls felt her 
'trust in males was (now) non-existent” while another said she “could 
not wait for the sentencing as it would be the first day of the rest of 
her life'.

Safe and Sound 
Derby helps children and young people who are being, or who are at risk 
of being sexually exploited and worked with two of the victims in the 
case and the parents of one of the victims.

Speaking
outside court Nathalie Walters, chief executive, said: 'The men 
involved in this case were sexual predators who targeted and preyed upon
vulnerable young girls.

'We
hope that the sentences handed down to them today send a clear message 
out that child sexual exploitation will not be tolerated.

'The
girls had to wait for two years to come to court where they had to 
relive their horrific ordeal in front of the very men who exploited 
them.

'Hopefully these 
sentences will provide some comfort to the victims and their parents and
help them to move on with their lives.'
