A Northern Californian city is attempting to use humorous road signs to get drivers to slow down and make pedestrians pay attention.

The city of Hayward has placed traffic signs along a downhill boulevard that read '35 — It's a speed limit, not a suggestion' and 'Heads up! Cross the street, then update Facebook.' 

Another sign warns: 'Downhill: Use eyes, brakes, brain.'

The Oakland Tribune reports city workers installed the offbeat traffic signs in January along Hayward Boulevard, which is known for cars zipping down from the hills.

City spokesman Frank Holland says authorities hope using humor will get people to do a double-take and be careful on the hill.

He told The Oakland Tribune: 'The idea is for people to do a double take and then realize, 'Oh, they want me to be careful on the hill.'

'Standard traffic signs often become white noise. ... We wanted to use humor to get people to take a second look and think.'

A recent survey found speeding was a top concern for residents in the area. 

Holland added: 'If people like the signs, great, the message has reached them. If they don't like the signs and think they're corny, they've still thought about them.'
