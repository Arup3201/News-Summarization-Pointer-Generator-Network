Frank Lampard is in the frame for a surprise place in the England squad despite not having played this season.

Roy Hodgson will name his England squad this week and is seriously considering the former Chelsea star because of an injury crisis in his midfield. 

Lampard is likely to be joined by Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph or Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse, both inexperienced players.

Shock: Frank Lampard is in line for a place in the England squad despite not playing for Manchester City yet

Back to the future: Lampard wasn't expected to be picked but an injury dictates that he might get the nod 

Call up: Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph could earn his first cap next month 

Teenager: James Ward-Prowse may become the latest Southampton player to progress to the full England squad

With a Euro 2016 qualifier to play in Switzerland on September 8, the England manager now faces a tough decision about whether to stick with his policy of opting for youth, or to ensure there is some experience in the squad.

Such is his shortage in midfield, with his captain Steven Gerrard retired and Ross Barkley, Michael Carrick and Adam Lallana injured and Tom Cleverley yet to play for Manchester United, Hodgson may turn to Lampard, even though he too has yet to play for his new club Manchester City.

Hodgson was at Aston Villa against Newcastle, meaning Delph could be an option in central midfield for this week’s squad, while his assistant Ray Lewington was at St Mary’s Stadium checking on Ward-Prowse and West Brom striker Saido Berahino.

Retired: Steven Gerrard quit international football after the World Cup

Injured: Adam Lallana has been ruled out through injury 

Hodgson had previously indicated he would turn to Lampard only in emergencies but he may be forced to do so given his lack of midfield options. 

For the Football Association, the friendly against Norway on September 3 looks to be an increasingly hard sell, with only 15,000 tickets sold and, on the back of the most disappointing World Cup performance, the attendance is likely to be a record low for an international match at the new Wembley.

The previous low was when England played Sweden in November 2011, attracting 48,876.

Decisions: Roy Hodgson has some big choices to make in his first post-World Cup England squad 

Goalkeepers: Hart (Man City), Foster (WBA), Forster (Soton); Johnson (Liverpool)

Defenders: Cahill (Chelsea), Jagielka (Everton), Smalling, Jones (both Man Utd), Stones (Everton), Baines (Everton), Gibbs, Chambers

Midfielders: Wilshere, Oxlade-Chamberlain (all Arsenal), Milner (Man City), Delph (A Villa), Cleverley (Man Utd), Lampard (NYC); Sterling

Strikers: Sturridge, Lambert (all Liverpool), Rooney, Welbeck (both Man Utd)
