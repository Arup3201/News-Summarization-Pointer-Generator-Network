An ultra-rare classic Jaguar E-Type designed for the race track has been sold for a price believed to be more than £5million.

Just 12 of the Lightweight E-Types were ever made, and of those only 11 are still in existence - meaning they are almost never up for sale on the open market.

They were designed as stripped-down racing versions of the popular sports car, and were used on well-known tracks against competitors such as the Ferrari 250 GTO.

Sold: This Lightweight E-Type Jaguar, one of just 11 still in existence, has been bought for millions of pounds

The model sold this week, known as YVH210, was built in 1963 owned by racing driver Peter Sutcliffe, who drove it in competition at Goodwood, the Nurburgring and Spa.

Classic car dealership Fiskens, based in Kensington, west London, has now sold two of the rare vehicles within the past year.

Dealer Gregor Fisken refused to reveal exactly how much the buyer paid, but it is believed to be between £4-7million.

That price tag, prompted by the extreme rarity and historical importance of the car, is 100 times more expensive than a brand new Jaguar F-Type would cost today.

Classic: Because of the rarity of the car, it almost never comes up for sale on the open market

Year of construction: 1963

Top speed: 150mph

Engine size: 3.8 litres

Engine power: 360 bhp

Weight: 1,009kg (2,224lbs)

'This model was raced by Peter Sutcliffe in period and is highly original,' Mr Fisken said after the sale. 'Peter was one of the great privateers.

'He bought the car from Jaguar and ran it himself, racing in Europe, England and South Africa. This car probably did more racing in period than any other E-Type.

'When it was raced at Goodwood, you would expect it to be getting up to more than 150mph. It was a very quick car, using cutting edge technology in the 1960s.'

The Lightweight E-Type had recently been restored by Gary Pearson, the son of Peter Sutcliffe's own mechanic.

New generation: This is one of the rebuilt Lightweight E-Types being built by Jaguar in Coventry

Mr Fisken added: 'I am very familiar with Lightweight E-Types and this is a car I have been after for a number of years.

'It is the second one we have sold in the past year. To sell one in a decade is good, but to sell two in a year is quite something.'

The sale comes as Jaguar continues to work on a new generation of Lightweight E-Types, using modern technology to replicate the original cars exactly.

The carmaker, which is owned by India's Tata Motors but headquartered in Coventry, is set to produce six of the throwback models.

They are being built by Jaguar Heritage, part of the company's new Special Operations division, at Browns Lane plant - the original home of the E-Type.

The vehicles will cost £1million each, but because they are made for racing they will not be road legal.
