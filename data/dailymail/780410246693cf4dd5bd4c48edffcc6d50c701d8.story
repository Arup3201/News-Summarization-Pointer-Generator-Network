These absolutely astonishing pictures of utterly incompetent parking are made all the more amazing because they come from a single town in the UK.

Doncaster may be in the running for being Britain's worst town for selfish, thoughtless and downright inept parking after a Facebook page exposed the South Yorkshire town's driver's nightmarish abuse of spaces, kerbs, roads and even steep slopes.

Parking like a t*** in Doncaster invites people in the town to submit pictures of the kind of parking that makes considerate road users slap their forehead in frustration.

What were they thinking? This driver has plonked his car across two spaces in a Doncaster car park. It is just one example from a Facebook page shaming poor parking in the town

Off-road: Perhaps this 4x4 owner wanted to test their vehicle's ability to climb slopes?

It has been liked more than 7,900 times and has been deluged with pictures of cars taking up two, three and even four parking spaces in car parks, vehicles blocking roads and pavements, motors squeezed into tight spots and cars parked in disabled and parent-only bays outside supermarkets.

The group, which has been set up anonymously, simply states: 'Fed up of people and their parking? Send us a pic in a message and it’ll be posted anonymously.'

One poster on the group said: 'I commend you on shaming these people who put the love of their car above their respect for other people.

'It is amusing and annoying in equal measure to see what some of these berks deem to be acceptable parking.'

Didn't brake in time? This white BMW has two wheels on the kerb, inexplicably

The founder of the group, who doesn't want to be identified, said: 'I started it as a but of a joke really.

'I saw a couple of bad examples and put them up and then people just started sharing their own.

'We went from having 60 people liking our group to 2,000 in one day and it has just kept growing and growing.

'It's a bit of fun more than anything but it has really spiralled and got people interested. I think lots of people don't like bad parking and this is their way of naming and shaming bad parkers.'

The offending drivers often visit the site to justify the puzzling placement of their vehicle, normally followed by a torrent of righteous indignation from those affected.

Waste of space: This van is taking up two spots in a busy car park

One man, whose car was blocking a pavement in a residential area, despite readily available space on the road beside it, said: 'How is this parkin like a t*** when im parked outside my house?'

His lack of understanding of the law and common courtesy was quickly, repeatedly and angrily pointed out by the page's community.

On a similar picture of a bright red Audi parked so that people walking along the street would be forced to step into a busy main road, someone wrote: 'I wish you a thousand buggy marks down the side of the car.'

But there is a serious message behind the page. Many have highlighted that poor parking is not only boorish and inconvenient, it can also be dangerous.

All over the place: This people carrier looks as if it has been abandoned

One woman, posting on a picture of a car parked entirely on a narrow pavement, said: 'People parking like this really need to think about the fact that in doing so they're forcing mums with pushchairs, children, elderly, in fact all pedestrians, to walk on the road - all because they're afraid that their precious cars might get a bump.

'Nice to know human life is worth so little to them!'

A Doncaster Council spokesman said: 'Dangerous and illegal parking causes problems for pedestrians, residents, traders and other road users and the council uses civil parking enforcement to undertake parking enforcement.

'Civil Enforcement Officers are a regular sighting across the borough serving residents and motorists alike.

'We don’t just hand out tickets, but play a vital role in keeping the town moving by keeping important routes clear and ensuring fair parking for residents, businesses and visitors.'
