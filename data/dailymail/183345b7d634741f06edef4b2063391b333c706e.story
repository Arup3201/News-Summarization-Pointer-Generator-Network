Controversy has rocked a high school state hockey game after young fans were spotted wearing Ku-Klux-Klan style robes in the crowd.

Pictures were uploaded onto Twitter from the North Dakota state hockey semi-final clash between the Red River High School, Grand Forks, and Davies High School, Fargo, at the Ralph Engelstad Arena on Friday, Fox News reports.

The three fans wearing the hoods were sitting in the Red River High School student section of the stadium and are now being investigated by the teachers at the public school.

Outrage: Other fans responded with shock at seeing the hooded trio among Red River High School supporters. When pictures were posted online dozens more criticized them

According to a statement released today authorities have already identified the suspected students.

Onlookers expressed their shock at the scene and criticized the pictures and the students when they appeared online.

Shane Schuster, 19, a university student who attended the game told Fox: 'I thought, 'Are those KKK hoods?' I couldn't believe it. I was shocked.'

Hockey fans have long had the tradition of wearing all-white and it seems the students exploited it to sneak in the racist hoods and wear them for about 10 to 20 minutes.

They removed them before the second period.

School row: The teens have all been identified as students at Red River High School, Grand Forks. The principal said he would deal with the issue but did not specify

The Grand Forks Public Schools athletics director, Mark Rerick, said: 'After confirming the incident, we notified the administrators at Red River High School who immediately began their investigation.

'To the best of my knowledge, the students have been identified by the Red River administrators who are continuing their investigation.'

The high school principal said today that the hoods were smuggled into the game and worn by the students immediately after Red River scored, ABC reported.

His account contradicted Schuster - he said the students only wore the hoods for a couple of minutes because of the response of other fans.

He also said he had contacted the students and the parents to discuss the 'offensive' behavior and said there would be 'appropriate action' but wouldn't specify what that would be.

Schuster uploaded a picture of the three teens onto Twitter and dozens wrote in to condemn their actions.

One woman wrote: 'I live there it's not a real shocker to me'.

Others branded them 'idiots' and 'insane'

Red River beat Fargo's Davies High School 2-0 and play again tonight.

Fox News pointed out that Davies High School is named in honor of Ronald Davies, the former federal judge whose 1957 rulings integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.
