Manchester United winger Nani missed a penalty, was cautioned and substituted in the 77th minute during his first game back at Sporting Lisbon.

Nani, who joined his former side on loan until the end of the season as a makeweight in the deal which saw Manchester United sign Marcos Rojo, will not be pleased with how his Sporting Lisbon debut went. 

The Portuguese international was handed the chance to score on his debut after 63 minutes but was unable to score from 12 yards   in Sporting Lisbon's Primeira Liga encounter against Arouca.

Saviour: Mane proved to be the match winner in Sporting Lisbon's league match against Arouca

Sporting managed to score in stoppage time through Carlos Mane which will take some of the pressure off of Nani.

Nani, who signed a five-year deal at Manchester United last September, failed to convince new manager Louis van Gaal that he was worthy of a first-team spot in the Dutchman's team.

Meanwhile, Rojo - who moved in the opposite direction as Nani - will not be able to make his Manchester United debut against Sunderland on Sunday as the club did not receive his work permit in time for their match at the Stadium of Light.
