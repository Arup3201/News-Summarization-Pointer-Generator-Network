Eddie Perez, 19, was taken into custody on Saturday night is facing a list of charges including false imprisonment, kidnapping, rape and torture

A 19-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping his 16-year-old girlfriend and beating her with a tire iron over five days.

Eddie Perez, 19, was taken into custody on Saturday night and is facing a list of charges including false imprisonment, kidnapping, rape and torture.

Sgt. Justin Vallin says the girl's family reported that she had run away about two weeks ago from Avenal. 

Investigators believe she was with Perez, but the relationship turned violent when he accused her of cheating on him several days ago.

Police said that Perez held the girl in his car, and she was able to signal a passerby for help on Friday afternoon while he was away.

Witnesses say the victim was found screaming in a car, unable to move from being beaten so badly, reports ABC7. 

Albert Martinez, who found her in the car, told the station: 'I wasn't sure what the situation was, so I did slowly approach the car. 

'She asked if she could use a phone, so I asked her what the situation was. 

'She was really panicked, and crying and really scared.'

Albert Martinez, (pictured) who found her in the car, said: 'Her face was really bruised. She was having a very hard time looking at who she was talking to. She couldn't really put a focus on me. Her eyes she couldn't really open'

He said: 'Her face was really bruised. She was having a very hard time looking at who she was talking to. 

'She couldn't really put a focus on me. Her eyes she couldn't really open.'

'She was forced to have sex with him. She was bound at the hands. She was forced to stay inside the car and use the restroom inside the car for the last four to five days,' said Justin Vallin with the Hanford Police Department. 

The girl was in a stable condition at a hospital on Sunday. 

Vallin did not know whether Perez had an attorney.
