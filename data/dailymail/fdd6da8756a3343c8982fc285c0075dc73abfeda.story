Cambridge University students are forced to dig trenches and clean toilets as punishment, it has been revealed.

One student at St John's College, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was forced to help groundsmen dig and fill in a trench while another claimed they had been made to clean toilets at 8am for an hour every day - for six days after breaking rules.

The Draconian measures were revealed as 
part of an investigation into the punitive system employed by each 
college at the university.

Most colleges impose fines for misbehaviour, ranging from loud parties and parking bikes in the wrong place, to skipping supervisions.

But St John’s college employs a 'community service' scheme instead of fines; the Office of the Dean can hand out any disciplinary measure it sees fit.

A spokesman for St John's college 
said: 'The range of disciplinary measures that can be imposed by the 
Dean of St John’s is defined in the College's Standing Orders.

'These include making a community service order up to a permitted maximum of hours per term.

'The Dean's policy is to make such an
 order in preference to imposing a fine. The College recognises that the
 effect of a fine varies according to students' ability to pay it.'

The claims of trench digging and toilet cleaning were made in the student newspaper The Cambridge Student.

It also revealed student have paid out a total of £38,209 in fines for bad behaviour since October 2011 - an average of £1,232.54 per college.

A Freedom of Information request found Newnham college had levied the most - more than a quarter of the total fines at £12,872 - all of which supplemented college income.

Meanwhile student fines at Downing College were used to fund a staff coach trip, figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed.

The College said the annual trip for ‘bedders,’ porters and administrative staff is justifiable because it rewards the staff inconvenienced by student misbehaviour.

A spokesman for Downing college added:
 'Most fines are suspended, as a means
 of encouraging better behaviour in the future and only in the worst 
cases are they imposed immediately.

'Any fines which are actually 
collected - and this may vary from nothing to a few hundred pounds in 
any year - are fed back into the staff social fund.

'In many cases the staff have been 
those who have had to deal with the often unpleasant outcome; the fine 
is hardly a 'reward' more a small compensation.

'The staff fund is used to support an
 annual outing, designed to improve inter-staff bonding; however, the 
far greater part of this cost is covered by their own fundraising events
 - raffles, cake sales, coffee mornings etc. The College agrees a day's 
absence from work to support this aim.'

One student from the college was fined £200 for stealing a candlestick and another student at Magdalene college was made to pay £600 for smoking cannabis in their room.

The spokesman added: 'The theft of a silver 
candlestick from another College was intended to send a very stern 
message that theft is never condoned, and potentially avoided the 
individual concerned being reported to the Police and ending up with a 
criminal record which could affect his future job prospects.'

Students at Girton college are charged up to £15 for each supervision session they miss.

But the figures showed the actual amount varies with £43.43 being charged for missing two supervisions and £50.32 for missing three.

Students are also fined £50 for leaving their bikes unattended in prohibited areas.

And if there is an act of vandalism on college grounds the entire student body is fined.

King’s college charges students £25 per head for every person involved in 'noise disturbance' while a 'noise violation' in Pembroke college merits a fine of £180.

Pembroke also fines £70 for setting off the fire alarm.

But a Pembroke student, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'One of my friends was fined £80 for setting off the fire alarm by boiling a kettle. Pembroke said they’d lower the fine if he didn’t contest them.'

Newnham £12,872 Gonville & Caius £9,930 Fitzwilliam £6,245 Clare £1,764 Girton £1,275.25

All fines revealed in the figures at Lucy Cavendish arise from leaving rooms in what were perceived to be unacceptable states.

A spokesman for Lucy Cavendish college said: 'Students are asked to clean their rooms on departure.

'If this is not the case, fines (as set out in College handbook) will be imposed.'

Newnham College charged £6,719 for 'housekeeping', but it did not state specific charges.

Queen’s college revealed it does not levy fines, but has other means of maintaining discipline.

A student from the college said: 'I think fining is terrible, as how severely people are affected by the fines will be largely dependent on the economic situation of the student and his/her family, which makes the system of punishment highly unfair.'

The University has no overarching policy with regard to fining students as it is at the discretion of individual colleges to enforce behavioural discipline.

Girton College (pictured) fined students £1,275.25 since October 2011. In total, Cambridge University students have paid out £38,209

Clare £1,205 - split between 5 students for a party

Magdalene £600 - smoking cannabis in room

Fitzwilliam £240 - bringing college into disrepute

Downing £200 - stolen candlestick

The University’s Statutes and Ordinances states that the University 'shall have all the powers of a natural 
person to acquire, manage, charge, deal with, and dispose of property, 
both real and personal [...] so that it may exercise any power and may 
enter into and carry out any kind of transaction without limitation.'

Colleges fine students for missing supervision, leaving their bikes unattended or for having disruptive parties.

The majority of colleges charge for any damage done to rooms, but as this is a remunerative sum it is therefore classed as a charge rather than a fine.

At matriculation, a student effectively acknowledges the University’s authority to deal with damage to property in any way the University sees fit.
