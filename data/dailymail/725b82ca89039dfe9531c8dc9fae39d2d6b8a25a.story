Every year the RAF proudly honours the fearless servicemen who were brutally executed during The Great Escape.

But modern times have now caught up with tradition and yesterday airmen were ordered to wear high-visibility vests over their fatigues due to health and safety reasons as they took part in a march to mark 70 years since the daring escape.

The bright yellow jackets are being worn by 50 British Royal Air Force personnel as they march from the site of the Nazi prisoner camp to a war cemetery in western Poland. 

A source involved with the march said: 'It is common sense. And there are some really bad Polish drivers.'

Modern times have now caught up with tradition and RAF personnel were ordered to wear high-vis vests over their fatigues due to health and safety reasons as they took part in a march to mark 70 years since the Great Escape of Allied airmen and to honour 50 of them who were caught and executed

One onlooker told The Sun: 'It's bonkers - they are trying to honour daring and secrecy by ticking all the health and safety boxes. Our war heros would be turning in their graves.'

In four days, the British airmen 
are to walk more than 100 miles to the British war cemetery in Poznan, 
where the ashes of those executed were buried after the war.

Marek Lazarz, director of the Stalag Luft III Museum near Zagan, said the British group started in pouring rain from a monument marking the place where 76 prisoners of war emerged.

During
 observances this week, they have met two British former Stalag inmates,
 retired RAF airmen Andrew Weisman and Charles Clarke, who were held at 
the camp after the time of the Great Escape.

The plot became the inspiration 
behind the classic war film The Great Escape starring Hollywood legend 
Steve McQueen.

A group of about 250 prisoners, started 
to digging tunnels, in which they were going to escape the 59-acre site,
 which had five miles of perimeter fencing.

More than 600 prisoners were involved 
in the construction of three tunnels - codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry - 
at the camp in the German Province of Lower Silesia, 100 miles southeast
 of Berlin.

Tom and Dick had to be abandoned with Harry becoming the focus of their escape route.

Time for a change? A mock-up of what the Horse Guards Parade would look like if they decided to wear a high-vis jacket over their red uniform

If the concept of wearing a high-vis jacket was deployed across all units it could look like this. Left, a patrol searching for IEDs and Taliban fighters and right, the Royal Guards at Buckingham Palace

Escape if he too had fallen victim to the health and safety zealots

It was approximately 300ft long and 28ft deep.

Only 200 of the higher ranking 
captives, those who could speak German and had put a lot of work into 
digging the tunnels, would have time to escape in the plan.

But there was a series of problems on the night of the escape.

The main issue was that the Harry tunnel came up short and in close proximity to a guard tower.

The plan: 250 officers spent 11 months building Harry, a 300ft tunnel out of the camp in Zagan, Poland

The site 100 miles south of Berlin was built to hold 10,000 prisoners of war during World War Two

A commemorative stone has been laid over the track listing the names of the men who concocted the idea

As the 77th man exited the tunnel, 
they were spotted by a guard who alerted the rest of the camp and 73 of 
the escaped prisoners were captured. Fifty of those were shot.

An RAF spokesperson said:  'There are 50 current serving RAF personnel currently walking towards Poznan, which is the final resting place for Sqn Ldr Roger Bushell, who was the mastermind for the Great Escape; when these personnel are walking on busy main roads, which are not closed to traffic, they are wearing hi-vis jackets to ensure they reach their destination safely.'
