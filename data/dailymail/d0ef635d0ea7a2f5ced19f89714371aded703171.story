It has been a busy couple of months for LeBron, the Heat reached the NBA Finals for the fourth consecutive year before eventually losing to the San Antonio Spurs in June.

Following Miami's defeat, James opted out of his contract with the Heat and decided to rejoin the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Earlier this week, a new photo showed him looking his thinnest ever as the results of his new, low-carb diet.

In the photo posted to his Instagram account on Monday, LeBron's face show the dramatic weight-loss with more-defined cheekbones.

An ESPN reporter close to the all-star 
tweeted that day that LeBron had cut carbohydrates from his diet and had
 dropped 'significant' weight.

LeBron appears to be taking his training in the off-season seriously, after deciding to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers last month.

According to their roster, he is 6-foot-8 and weights 250 pounds.

In a move to show his re-dedication to the Cleveland community, LeBron and his two sons pitched in on Monday to help renovate a house for the family an 11-year-old in his Wheels for Education mentoring program.

LeBron took the controls of a backhoe Monday to help fix up sixth-grader Mariah Riley's crumbling house, with the help of songs LeBron Jr and Bryce.
