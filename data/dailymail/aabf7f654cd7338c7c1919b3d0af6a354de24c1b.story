The month of November may seem like a long way away - but preparation for the Poppy Appeal is already well under way.

Every year 155 miles (250km) of red paper is produced in Burneside, Cumbria, which is then turned into more than 50million remembrance poppies.

Specialist materials group James Cropper has been producing the biodegradable paper since 1978, when the Royal British Legion stopped using fabric.

The firm, overseen by the Cropper family's sixth generation, has taken colour samples from real poppy petals to make the paper close to the real thing.

David Horsman, a former weapons engineer and ships diver in the Royal Navy, was invited to symbolically kick-start the production process last week.

This year holds special significance for 
the appeal as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the 
First World War in 1914.

Phil Wild, chief executive of James Cropper, said: ‘Although we are involved each year in the production of papers for remembrance poppies, we don't take it for granted what the poppy means to so many families and the country as a whole.

‘Everyone at both James Cropper Paper and Technical Fibre Products are proud to be able to arrange this special gesture of remembrance and support for the Poppy Appeal and are grateful to Mr Horsman for his service, fundraising contributions and time to mark the occasion with us.’

Mr Horsman saw the concentrated red colourant gradually turn the swirling container of paper pulp deep crimson, helping to celebrate and raise-awareness of the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.

Preparations: The wet coloured paper passes through rollers ready to be dried. This year is the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War.

After serving on vessels including HMS Liverpool from 1979 to 1987, Mr Horsman called on the help of the Royal British Legion for financial assistance.

'There is more to this iconic emblem than at first meets the eye - the paper colour does not run in the rain or rub off onto clothing, it retains its vibrant colour and holds its shape'

Now a successful businessman, he gives thanks for the support offered to him by giving his time as a Poppy Appeal organiser.

Mr Horseman said: ‘Being an ex-servicemen, I have been overwhelmed by fact that I have started off production of poppies that will go absolutely everywhere. It really has not sunk in yet.

'The Royal British Legion really helped me get on my feet when I left the Navy. The biggest thing they did was to help me set up my own business.’

Every week the Royal British Legion spends around £1.7million on the welfare of ex-service personnel.

Marcus Hawthorn, area manager for Cumbria at the Royal British Legion, said: ‘It's a pleasure to witness the start of the poppy journey at James Cropper.

‘The red paper will be transformed into millions of poppies, which enables the Legion to continue providing practical help and support to the whole Armed Forces community.

‘In this poignant year which marks the centenary of the First World War we encourage the nation to reflect on the sacrifices made by all servicemen and women who fought for the freedom we enjoy today.’

From Cumbria, the paper makes a 300-mile trip to Kent. Poppy Factories produce more than 50million remembrance poppies, 500,000 poppies of other types, 5million remembrance petals, 100,000 wreaths and sprays, 750,000 remembrance crosses and other remembrance items.

Dave Watson, James Cropper chief operations officer, said: ‘We are very proud of our longstanding involvement in the production of the paper poppy.

'It must be said that there is more to this iconic emblem than at first meets the eye - the paper colour does not run in the rain or rub off onto clothing, it retains its vibrant colour and holds its shape.

‘The diverse technical chemistry required to achieve this ensures the paper poppy is worn with confidence the world over as a symbol of respect and remembrance.’
