Shock: Private detective Glenn Mulcaire had his legal fees paid by News International even after he was jailed for phone hacking. This was finally stopped today

News International bowed to pressure yesterday and announced it would cease paying the legal fees of the private investigator jailed over phone hacking.

Glenn Mulcaire, who was paid more than £100,000 a year under contract to the News of the World, was found guilty of hacking into the phones of several people and sentenced to six months in prison in 2007.

The move follows evidence given by James Murdoch to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, when he told MPs he was ‘surprised’ that ‘certain legal fees were paid to Mr Mulcaire’.

During a three-hour grilling by a parliamentary select committee yesterday, he also indicated that money has also been paid to disgraced former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman.

But less than 24 hours later, the 
publisher of the now defunct tabloid, bosses said they had stopped 
paying Mulcaire's fees with 'immediate effect'. It did not mention Goodman.

It came after Rupert Murdoch vowed to end the payments provided it was not 'in breach of a legal contract'.

The admission was the most dramatic revelation during three hours of testimony by Mr Murdoch and his father Rupert.

It immediately stoked the suspicion that the company has sought to buy the silence of the men at the heart of the scandal.

Mr Murdoch junior spent the hearing 
trying to rescue both his company and his father from tough questioning,
smoothly responding to MPs’ inquiries with a combination of denial and 
management speak.

Goodman and Mulcaire were both jailed in 2007 for intercepting the voicemails of members of the royal household.

But James Murdoch stunned MPs when he
said explicitly: ‘Certain legal fees were paid for Mr Mulcaire by 
the company and I was surprised and shocked to learn that as you are.’

But after being asked about Mr 
Goodman hiring an expensive lawyer, he referred to payments going to 
‘those’ men in the plural, indicating that he meant Mr Goodman as well.

He said the money was handed over ‘in
accordance with legal counsel and strong advice’ but both he and his 
father said they were trying to put a stop to the payments.

Former News International chief 
executive Rebekah Brooks later confirmed that it had paid the legal fees
of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson even after he left the 
company and added: ‘I think the same for Clive Goodman. On Glenn 
Mulcaire, I think his legal fees would be paid when he was a 
co-defendant in the civil cases.’

Labour MP Paul Farrelly said: ‘People
might ask why a company would wish to pay the legal fees of a convicted
felon, who’s been intimately involved in the destruction of your 
reputation, if it were not to buy his co-operation and silence.’

While Rupert Murdoch was blunt but 
frank, his son continually denied knowledge of phone hacking and illegal
practices at the News of the World until the end of last year.

His strategy appeared to be to blame 
News International’s failure to act to stamp out widespread phone 
hacking on the law firm Harbottle and Lewis.

Questions: Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman may also have had his legal fees paid

They were hired to examine 
internal emails four years ago, but according to Mr Murdoch concluded 
there was no evidence that people other than Goodman and Mulcaire were 
to blame.

But last night Harbottle and Lewis 
cast doubt on that by asking to be released from the rules of client 
confidentiality in order to ‘respond to any inaccurate statements or 
contentions’.

The firm said: ‘News International 
declined that request, and so we are still unable to respond in any 
detail as to our advice or the scope of our instructions in 2007, which 
is a matter of great regret.’

James Murdoch was also asked why the 
company paid around £1.7million to two victims of phone hacking, before 
the recent scandal broke, but only £20,000 to TV presenter Andy Gray in 
recent weeks.

He denied News International had paid
‘hush money’ to Professional Footballers Association boss Gordon Taylor
and PR man Max Clifford. He said those sums were recommended by the 
company’s lawyers.

But Tory Philip Davies said: ‘To most people looking at that it smells a bit.’

Rebekah Brooks also sought to deflect
attention from the storm swirling around her. She blamed Chancellor 
George Osborne for telling David Cameron to hire Andy Coulson, who was 
editor of the News of the World when Goodman and Mulcaire were jailed.

Mrs Brooks, who resigned as chief 
executive of News International last week, denied ever authorising the 
paying of a policeman – despite having said in 2003 the practice had 
happened.

Police moved last night to quell 
conspiracy theories surrounding the death of ex-News of the World 
reporter Sean Hoare, 47, who claimed phone hacking was ‘endemic’ at the 
paper.

He was found dead at his flat on 
Monday. A post-mortem examination was unable to determine the cause of 
death, but police said there was no evidence of any foul play.
