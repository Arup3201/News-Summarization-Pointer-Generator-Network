Ohio’s Miami University is taking heat after the discovery of a flier advising how to rape women was found last weekend in freshman co-ed dorm bathroom.

Titled “Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape,” the flier tells readers that 'practice makes perfect. The more you rape, the better you get at it.'

It also says: 'If you're afraid that the girl will identify you, slit her throat,' and to 'never take pictures or give your phone number to the girl you rape.'

The offending typo-filled top ten list hardly caused a stir among Miami University officials, but has some students up in arms.

'It could have been a joke, but the fact of the matter is that those thoughts are crossing someone’s mind,' said Miami University junior Kate Van Fossen, vice president of Women Against Violence and Sexual Assault (WAVE).

'There are girls living in a hall where someone came up with that. It’s just disturbing,' she told told Cincinnati.com.

A resident assistant at McBride Hall found the flier over the weekend and reported it on Monday, Van Fossen said.

Barbara Jones, Miami’s vice president for student affairs, chose not to alert students of the incident because it didn't pose an immediate threat, the report said.

'All of our evidence shows it was confined strictly to McBride Hall,' she's quoted as saying.

'I read the flier. I was shocked. It has no place on our campus or any other campus,' she said, adding that it was 'reprehensible.'

After the discovery, Miami officials 
held a mandatory meeting for male students at McBride Hall, launched a 
campus police investigation, and increased campus police presence at 
McBride Hall.

Van Fossen doesn't think officials are doing enough.

'If I wasn’t involved with WAVE I wouldn’t have known about this incident,” Van Fossen told Cincinnati.com Friday. “The university is brushing this issue ... under the rug.'

Van Fossen said university officials denied her request to send out a notice to students.

She also questions whether Miami is serious about sexual assault prevention on campus -- the university’s sexual assault prevention coordinator position has been vacant for a year, she said.

According to the report, a campus crime alert online indicates a recent attack involved a female student who reported being raped near a school construction site on September 23.

On Miami University's campus police website, 27 sexual assaults have been reported on the campus between 2009 through 2011, 19 of them were alleged to have happened in dorms.

No numbers were released for 2012.
