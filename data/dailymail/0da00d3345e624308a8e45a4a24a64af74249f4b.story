A staggering £12,000 of taxpayers' money was spent by town hall chiefs on forcing a car dealer to move a stack of old tyres just 25ft, it emerged today.

Jason Evans, 46, stored the tyres at the back of his workshop site in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire, while he stripped old and used vehicles for parts - which he then sold to customers and on eBay.

A fire in 2004 forced him to move the 1,000 tyres to a different area of his three-acre site. But the council claimed he had breached his licence to store tyres in the correct area and prosecuted him.

After pleading guilty to technically breaching the terms of his licence to store tyres, he was forced to move them 25ft into the designated area - costing the taxpayer £480 per ft.

Father-of-three Mr Evans - who has run a breakers yard and car repair business since 1986 - today blasted what he described as the 'over-zealous' attitude of Stratford District Council.

He said: ‘I was taken to court and I was forced to plead guilty to keeping the tyres technically outside the area I had a licence to store them. I moved them originally after I had a fire at the yard.

‘The fire brigade advised me to move them away from the main buildings. I did this but the council took exception to this and pursued me through the courts all at the taxpayers' expense.

‘It seems ridiculous that some 
over-zealous council officials wanted to drag me through the courts for 
the sake of moving the tyres a measly 25ft.’

Mr Evans appeared at Leamington Spa 
Magistrates’ Court on August 13 and was given 28 days to move his tyres 
back into the correct area. He was also fined £2,000.

The dealer, who trades under the name 
G.J. Evans, is the third generation of his family to run the business on
land they have owned since 1958.

He keeps dozens of old cars on the site which he restores and sells on - with the remaining parts then sold on eBay.

Mr Evans added: ‘My dad was a car dealer,
my granddad was a car dealer, it is a third-generation family business 
and we're proud of what we do.

‘We don't like to waste any parts of the 
car so try and strip them of parts or rebuild and repair them - unlike 
the council, which is happy to waste thousands of taxpayers' cash.’

Robert Oxley, campaign director of 
the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘This is a gratuitous waste of taxpayers’ 
money that council officials should be held to account for.

‘Council officials appear to have acted completely unreasonably in their relentless pursuit of this unnecessary case.

‘If officials had been footing the bill themselves then they might have been a bit more careful before embarking on yet more costly legal action.’

Conservative-run Stratford District Council admitted they spent £12,000 on the case.

A
spokesman said: ‘The council isn't out of pocket. If the officers 
weren't working on this case they would've been working on another 
case.’

Following the court action last month, Councillor Chris Williams, chairman of the council's regulatory committee, said: 'I am pleased with the court's ruling, especially for the local people living near by.

'This has been an on-going enforcement case for a number of years and demonstrates that planning enforcement is a very complex area and can be a long draw out and expensive process - and is not something that can be resolved overnight.

'People who continue to break these rules and threaten the character of the district risk legal action and significant penalties. This case demonstrates that the district council will not be deterred from taking action, when appropriate.'
