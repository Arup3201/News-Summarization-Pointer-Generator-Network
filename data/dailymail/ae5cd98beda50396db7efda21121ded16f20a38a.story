Iran's hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has joined a chorus of Islamist nations that have condemned an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S. 

The Islamist regime also had some tough talk in the face of a possible attack from Israel over its long-disputed nuclear programme.

When asked about the series of protests sparked by the film in the Muslim world, Ahmadinejad called the protests ‘ugly,’ but slammed the video itself as an 'abuse of freedom.'

Tough talk: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has condemned the anti-Muslim film that has sparked outrage across the Muslim world

CNN's Piers Morgan sat down with Ahmadinejad in New York this week after the Iranian president arrived for the UN General Assembly this week. 

He told Morgan: 'Fundamentally, first of all, any action that is provocative, offends the religious thoughts and feelings of any people, we condemn.'

He added: 'Likewise, we condemn any type of extremism. Of course, what took place was ugly. Offending the Holy Prophet is quite ugly. This has very little or nothing to do with freedom and freedom of speech.

'This is the weakness of and the abuse of freedom, and in many places it is a crime. It shouldn't take place and I do hope the day will come in which politicians will not seek to offend those whom others hold holy,' said Ahmadinejad.

In an original English version and another dubbed into Egyptian Arabic, Mohammed is branded a child molester, a fraud and a madman, and he's shown him having sex and calling for massacres.

People involved in the film, an amateurish 13-minute clip of which was posted on YouTube, have said it was made by a 55-year-old California man, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula.

Nakoula has not returned to his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos since leaving voluntarily to be interviewed by federal authorities. His family has since gone into hiding.

During the one-on-one on CNN, which will air on Monday night, Ahmadinjad also discussed the possibility of a military conflict with Israel.

He told Morgan: 'Any nation has the right and will indeed defend herself. But my question is this: Why should the world be managed in such a way that an individual can allow himself to threaten a rich and deeply rooted historical, ancient country, such as Iran. A great country, such as Iran, based on an excuse of his own fabrication?'

But an Iranian general took a more aggressive stance on a possible attack from Israel, promising that the Islamist regime’s army could wipe out Israel in a day, according to PressTV.

Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the deputy commander of the regime's elite Revolutionary Guards force, told an Iranian television station: 'A regime [with a frontier] that in some spots is only 24 kilometers wide could have its back broken by one of our infantry battalions in 24 hours.'

It wouldn’t be the first time that such inflammatory remarks were heard from Iran including from Ahmadinejad himself, who has vowed in the past to 'wipe Israel off the map.'

Israel has warned that the Iranians are quickly approaching weapons capability and that the threat of force must be seriously considered.

The U.S. says sanctions and international diplomacy must be given more time to work.

Netanyahu, speaking to his Cabinet, said a new report by the UN nuke agency showing progress in the Iranian nuclear programme bolstered his claim that international pressure is not working.

Netanyahu said: 'I believe that the truth must be said, the international community is not drawing a clear red line for Iran, and Iran does not see international determination to stop its nuclear programme.'
