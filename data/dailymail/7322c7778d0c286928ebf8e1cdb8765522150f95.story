A 66-year-old priest and 71-year-old man have been charged in relation to alleged historic sexual abuse at a children's home in Hounslow, police said tonight.

Father Anthony McSweeney was today charged with three counts of indecent assault, three of making indecent images of a child, one count of taking indecent images of a child and one of possessing indecent images of a child.

The arrests follow an investigation into the abuse alleged to have taken place at Grafton Close Children's Home in west London.

dating back to the 1980s

John Stingemore, 71, was charged with eight counts of indecent assault, two of taking indecent images of a child and one count of conspiracy to commit buggery.

The men are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in September. A third man arrested in connection with Operation Fernbridge remains of police bail.

The charges relate to seven victims, all of whom were
aged between nine and 15 years when the offences took place during the 70s and
80s.

It is claimed that boys living at Grafton Close were taken to Elm Guest House (pictured) in nearby Barnes where they were subjected to appalling sexual abuse

Operation Fernbridge was launched 
with the help of Labour MP Tom Watson to investigate claims that a group
of senior 'Establishment' figures sexually abused 
boys in council care throughout the 1980s.

Stingemore is believed to be a former 
deputy of head of Grafton Close children's home in Richmond, which is at
the centre of the abuse allegations.

Former
ministers, senior MPs, top police officers and those with links to the 
royal household are alleged to have indecently assaulted vulnerable, 
under-age males at a care home and nearby guest house.

Grafton Close shut more than 20 years ago and police have stressed
that the abuse claims are historic and are not linked with the current 
occupants of Elm Guest House, which has been converted into flats.

Allegations over Elm Guest House first emerged at a 1990 inquest into the suicide of its German manager Carole Kasir.

Child protection campaigners said at the hearing that in 1988 she told 
them boys from council-run Grafton Close had been taken to the 
guesthouse and abused.

Mrs Kasir had a 1982 conviction for running a brothel. But campaigners 
said the manager had no idea at the time of the child abuse.

It is claimed that boys living at 
Grafton Close were taken to Elm Guest House in nearby Barnes where they 
were subjected to appalling sexual abuse.

One
frequent visitor to the guest house is said to have been Liberal MP 
Cyril Smith, who is widely believed to have abused the teenage boys who 
lived in a hostel run by him.

Anyone with information, who has any concerns or believes
they may have been a victim is asked to contact the NSPCC on their helpline
0808 800 5000.
