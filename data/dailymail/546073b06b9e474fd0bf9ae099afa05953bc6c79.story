Tiger Woods will have to raise his game to a higher level than ever before to beat Rory McIlroy, according to Colin Montgomerie.

Woods has been a shadow of the golfer he once was following serious back injuries this year and finished last in his most recent comeback following major surgery. But the American superstar has 14 majors to his name, including four won in row across 2000 and 2001, a feat dubbed the 'Tiger Slam' and hailed by many as the greatest golf ever played.

McIlroy, meanwhile, has seized Woods's crown as the undisputed world No 1 and won this year's Open and US PGA Championship in spectacular style to take his own total to four. The 25-year-old Northern Irishman will be bidding for three in a row at the Masters in April, a title won by Woods on four occasions.

Tiger Woods has been beset by serious back injuries and question marks hang over his future in the game

There are question marks over whether Woods, now approaching his 39th birthday, will ever regain his best form. But Montgomerie warned his former rival that McIlroy is now playing golf that surpasses anything he has ever achieved.

'Tiger Woods is going to come back into the frame,' Mongomerie told Kicca.com when discussing next year's Masters. 'Is he going to be able to get back, not just to the levels he was but better than that? Because that’s where Rory McIlroy's taken the standard of golf: to one level beyond where Tiger was.'

McIlroy suffered a spectacular meltdown in the final round at Augusta National in 2011 after holding a four-shot lead after 54 holes. But Montgomerie insisted McIlroy is 'a much better golfer now than he was then' and backed him to win the Masters.

'You'd have to say McIlroy is favourite. It's about time he won it,' added the Scot, who was Europe's No 1 golfer for eight years  but never won a major championship. Montgomerie duelled with Woods for The Open at St Andrews in 2005 but was beaten into second place.

Montgomerie also looked even further ahead, tipping McIlroy to claim a second US Open at Chambers Bay in June and thus a career Grand Slam of majors.

The Ryder Cup legend was even prepared to speculate that McIlroy could go on to win all four majors in 2015, which would be six in a row, an unprecedented feat in the sport.

'If he does win the Masters that US Open will be a big, big, big do indeed,' said Montgomerie.

'Can he win all four in a year? That’s another question on people’s lips within our game. Can he win all four in a year, never mind two? That means six in a row. Wow, that’ll be something.

'If you’re a betting man - I’m sure there’s a lot of people putting money on it - I’m sure it’s a 100-1 shot but it’s worth a punt.'

The odds of McIlroy winning all four majors in 2015 are currently 80-1 with many bookmakers.

Montgomerie added: 'If I was a gambler, which I’m not, I’d put money on that; he’s that dominant, and that good.'
