In 1940, when Ralph Miliband was swearing to be ‘faithful to the workers’ cause’ while enjoying life in this country, which offered him a home and safety, my beautiful, brave mother, as a young woman, was starting two years of slavery in the Soviet Union which people with the professor’s ideological views had endorsed.

She was taken away from Poland — along with about two million other Poles — and forced to work in terrible conditions in the fields and forests in northern Russia, near Archangel.

Fortunately, she was blessed with courage and intelligence, and with the kindness and generosity extended to her by ordinary Russians, she survived.

In her view, anyone who thinks Marxism is the answer has either never experienced life within that system or is, quite simply, mad.

The Mail says Ed Miliband’s father hated the Royal Family, the Church and the Army, and wanted a workers’ revolution.

What he probably meant was he hated the Royal Family for the fake tyrannical institution it has always been, and the Church, as he was an atheist. 

And not the Army personnel, but rather the military armament complex that sucks the wealth out of all but a few, as even Eisenhower warned.

And what is wrong with a workers’ revolution? It’s long overdue.

I don’t like Ed Miliband, but I am now an admirer of his father, who would certainly get my seal of approval.

Pete Cresswell, Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh.

The Mail was quite right to highlight the nature of Ed Miliband’s father.

The Left describes him as a ‘socialist’. He was a Marxist. The nature of Miliband’s parents is relevant. The Left does not hesitate to attack the Tories as posh, and their parentage and background.

Attacking the Mail for doing what the Left does is pure hypocrisy. But generally the Left hates having done to it what it does to others. It hates having its tactics used on it.

Further, to attack the Mail for the first Lord Rothermere’s supposed attitudes in the 1930s is intellectually disgusting and shows the low level of politics in this country. Leftist bullies cannot be allowed to prevail.

Finally, as a Jew, I cringe at Ralph Miliband being called ‘Jewish’. Jewish Marxists are among the worst enemies the Jewish people have. Marxists were among the worst persecutors of Jews and Judaism. Karl Marx himself was author of one of the worst anti-semitic rants of the 19th century. Has Ed Miliband eschewed his parents’ attitudes towards Jews and Israel?

By all means criticise Ed Miliband’s policies — that is what a free press is all about — but to start using his father, who is no longer with us, as a means of character assassination is not only distasteful, but a personal attack.

The Mail may put forward all the arguments it has at its disposal against Miliband, the Labour Party and Left-wing beliefs, but it seems to be sinking to the level of the red-top tabloid press it professes to despise when it uses a politician’s family background — and his dead father to boot — to make its point.

Jonquil Tracy, Pevensey, Sussex.

What a hypocrite Ed Miliband is in protesting against alleging Ralph Miliband hated Britain.

When Margaret Thatcher died, there was nothing more disgraceful than the attacks by much of the Labour Party and Trade Unions on her political career. Savage burnings of effigies and parties celebrating her death were organised. Was any attempt made by the Labour Party leadership to call for restraint? No. Not a peep.

So pardon me if I have little sympathy for him. His father has got off lightly with regard to criticism of his political life when compared with others.

James Wignall, Accrington.

I passionately support a free press but deplore your dirty tricks treatment of Ed Miliband’s father.

Have we got to endure this for the next 18 months? Don’t appreciate it, don’t like it, don’t approve. Shame.

Mrs Louise Bellanti, Bromyard, Herefordshire.

In his reply to the Daily Mail ‘Why my father loved Britain’, Ed Miliband appears to give the excuse that his father was only 17 when he made his negative comments of hating Britain.

If being 17 years is his excuse — the presumption being one of immaturity — then why is he advocating lowering the voting age to 16?

Authoritarian states cannot distinguish between dissent and subversion so it’s a good thing that Geoffrey Levy didn’t make his take on Ed Miliband’s dad under communist rule — otherwise it would have been off to the gulag for him.

John Collins, Chelmsford, Essex.

I knew Ralph Miliband well in the Eighties. I corroborate everything that his son has said. Ralph did indeed have great affection for Britain, his home for all his adult life.

He supported strongly many of the beliefs central to ‘the British way of life’.

Contrary to the implications of your editorial, Ralph was a persistent and vociferous critic of Stalinist communism. It was a privilege to have known him.

Richard Taylor, Penrith, Cumbria.

Ed Miliband is lucky to have had the Mail publish a sizeable rebuff concerning his late Marxist father, Ralph Miliband.

If the tables were turned and he had been a fascist, the biased BBC and The Guardian would have, at best, simply ignored son Ed.

Maurice Bligh, Sittingbourne, Kent.

It’s fine for Labour to vilify Margaret Thatcher once she’s safely dead (as they still vilify Churchill).  

But Red Ed’s double standards mean that the Daily Mail and others must not tell the truth about his socialist parent, who enjoyed freedom of speech — yet who, like Red Ed, wanted to destroy the freedom of speech enjoyed by those who disagree with him.

Chris Hey, Walsall, West Mids.

Ed Miliband never stops smearing David Cameron over his background and schooling — but now Ed feels badly served when his own background is mentioned.

Martin Burgess, Beckenham, Kent.

Double standards? Martin Burgess says that Ed Miliband never stops smearing David Cameron over his background and schooling

Your newspaper has for many years has been serving up a diet of negative portrayal of everything which is going on in Britain, irrespective of whether the government is Labour or Conservative/Liberal.

Anybody would think that it is the worst place to live in the world.

The latest attack on Ed Miliband’s father is totally unacceptable. I am not a strong supporter of the Labour Party, but it seems you are using this opportunity to paint Ed Miliband and the Labour Party in some kind of Marxist or socialist rhetoric which is completely out of tune with modern Britain.

Chris Scott-Barrett, address supplied.

Your leading article is in error in claiming that Ed Miliband has a ‘determination to place the British press under statutory control’.

Labour, like the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, backs implementation of the Leveson recommendations by Royal Charter.

Far from delivering statutory control, this protects freedom of expression and actually reduces the danger of political meddling in the Press.

It also offers better protection to ordinary people from the kinds of press abuses that made the Leveson Inquiry necessary.

Prof Brian Cathcart, executive director, Hacked Off, London SW1.    

Naturally, Ed Miliband is going to defend his father, wouldn’t we all do likewise?

However, there are many immigrants who enjoy the freedom and generosity of this country but constantly want to change it.

That anyone really would want a political system like the impoverished, drab and miserable communist world beggars belief.

John Evans, Wokingham, Berks.
