Britain could open up to 12 new 'superjails' with room for 3,000 inmates each.

Officials are studying plans by the influential Policy Exchange think-tank to close 30 'run down and poorly located' prisons which are hugely expensive to run.

Kevin Lockyer, an ex-prison governor and deputy director at the Ministry of Justice, said they should be replaced by 10 -12 giant new jails.

With up to 3,000 prisoners each, they would be twice the size of the existing largest institution in the country, 1,600 place HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton.

Mr Lockyer claims the plan could save more than £600 million a year on completion - 20 per cent of the prison budget and equivalent to around 9 per cent of the MoJ's entire departmental budget.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said it was 'absolutely right' to try to find ways of reducing the cost of the country's 'old and inefficient' prison estate.

The idea of opening huge jails has proved hugely controversial in the past - with critics claiming they would be more likely to suffer from riots.

But Mr Lockyer said the new prisons would be 'materially different' from Labour's 2007 plans for Titan prisons, which would have held 2,500 inmates.

They would have a campus-style design with space for education and employment.

Mr Lockyer, who was governor at two Victorian-era prisons, said: 'We are busting the myth that small is beautiful when it comes to prisons. In fact, newer prisons outperform older ones, regardless of their size.

'We need to build larger, newer facilities that use the most up-to-date technology to monitor inmates.

'New hub prisons will not only reduce reoffending and improve safety - they will also deliver vast financial savings and better value for money for the taxpayer.'

Mr Lockyer said the construction of the new prisons could be financed through public sector borrowing, private finance or development finance and claims the savings would amount to around £10 billion over a 25-year repayment period.

He said the Government should focus on cutting the cost per prisoner, rather than simply closing prisons and reducing prisoner numbers.

The report shows that a quarter of prisons are Victorian or older while a further quarter were built in the 1960s and 1970s, often to poor standards and designs with poor materials.

It recommends locating new prisons on brownfield sites near main transport routes and to hold more prisoners as close to home as possible.

The prisons should be designed using cutting-edge architecture, with technologies such as biometric security systems, he added.

Mr Lockyer also recommends allowing private providers to compete on a level playing field with the public sector to manage and run the new establishments. Among the prisons recommended for closure by Mr Lockyer are Brixton, Feltham, Holloway, Pentonville, Wandsworth and Wormwood Scrubs.

Last night, Mr Grayling said: 'The report is absolutely right to highlight that much of our prison estate is old and inefficient, and that we need to bring its cost down.

'We are constantly reviewing it to ensure that it meets the needs of the prison population and provides the best value for money for the taxpayer.

'I never want the Courts to be in a position where they cannot send a criminal to prison because there is no place available. So we have to move as fast as we can to replace the older parts of our prison system.

'That's why we are moving ahead with immediate plans for new capacity and developing proposals for the next generation of prisons.'

But Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'With crime falling and community sentences and treatment to tackle addictions working to reduce reoffending, it would be a gigantic mistake to pour taxpayers' money down a super-sized, big brother prison building drain.

'There is scope to close some outdated prisons and reinvest the money saved into effective community solutions to crime.'
