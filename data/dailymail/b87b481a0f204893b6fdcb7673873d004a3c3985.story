Professional athletes continued to protest the Eric Garner and Michael Brown grand jury verdicts over the weekend with messages written directly on their clothes and shoes.

Just days after making headlines for raising his arms in support of Brown along with several teammates before a November game, St. Louis Rams wide receiver Kenny Britt scrawled the names of slain black teens on his game day shoes Sunday.

He included Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and others in a trend that appears to be catching on with big league athletes amid a national groundswell of solidarity with victims of what many see as an unjust legal system.

In memoriam: St. Louis Rams wide receiver Kenny Britt wrote the names of slain black teens on his game day shoes Sunday

Honored: Brit included (though did, unfortunately misspell) the names of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin as well as other teens on his shoes before a game against the Washington Redskins

It's a trend that Britt seems to have helped start. The 26-year-old wrote on his wrists 'Mike Brown' and 'My kids matter' before the November 30 game he began by raising his arms. He would later dedicate the night's win to the slain 18-year-old.

More professional athletes were wearing 'I Can't Breathe' messages Sunday in protest of a grand jury ruling not to indict an officer in the death of Eric Garner.

Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose wore the message on his T-shirt during warmups before Saturday night's home game.

Growing movement: Britt had previously dedicated a game in November to Michael Brown and wore these messages on his wrists

Also with St. Louis: Rams offensive lineman Davin Joseph wrote the 'I can't breathe' message on his shoes on Sunday

Cleveland Browns cornerback Johnson Bademosi sported the 'I can't breathe' message on Sunday, as well

Meanwhile, in Detroit: Wearing a Detroit Lions shirt with 'I can't breathe' written on the front, running back Reggie Bush runs through pre-game warmups in an NFL football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Detroit on Sunday

Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush and Cleveland Browns cornerback Johnson Bademosi warmed up in shirts with the message before NFL games Sunday.

St. Louis Rams offensive lineman Davin Joseph wore the message on his cleats.

The slogan refers to Eric Garner, who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold while he was being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. 

A grand jury decided Wednesday it would not indict the officer. A video of the arrest showed Garner gasping, 'I can't breathe.' 

Gaining momentum: Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose wears a shirt reading 'I Can't Breath' while warming up for a game against the Golden State Warriors on Saturday

St. Louis Rams players, Stedman Bailey (12), Tavon Austin (11), Jared Cook, (89) Chris Givens (13) and Kenny Britt (81) raise their arms in awareness of the events in Ferguson, Missouri as they walk onto the field during introductions before an NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders in St. Louis
