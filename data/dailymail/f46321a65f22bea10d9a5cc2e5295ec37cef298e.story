Swedish archeologists have uncovered the remains of a brutal fifth century massacre at a remote island fort, described as being 'frozen in time' like the ruins of the Roman city of Pompeii.

Bodies of victims slaughtered in the violence on the island of Öland, just off the Swedish coast, have remained untouched for centuries, and were found to resemble a modern day crime scene.

Before they attack, the fort appears to have been a peaceful and prosperous place, where people lived comfortably in small huts and reared livestock for meat.

But their peace was shattered when a group of unknown men burst in one night, butchering the residents in a vicious and unexplained attack.     

Helene Wilhelmson, a researcher who specializes in the study of bones at Sweden's Lund University, said: 'It's more of a frozen moment than you normally see in archaeology.

'It's like Pompeii: Something terrible happened, and everything just stopped.'

So far five bodies have been unearthed amid the ruins of one of the huts. Two were found lying next to the door as if they had been slaughtered as they tried desperately to escape. 

Why the fort has been left untouched for 
1,500 years remains a mystery. One theory is that the location became 
taboo after the massacre, with people simply too terrified to set foot there.

Archaeologist Helene Wilhelmson said the site was like a moment 'frozen in time'

During the Migration Period in Scandinavia it was customary to burn the dead, and very few uncremated remains have previously been recovered.

At an earlier excavation in 2010 the team discovered gilded brooches, raising questions as to why they were not plundered in the wake of the massacre.

Ms Wilhelmson added: 'I think they 
were surprised and there were so many bodies and two of them are lying 
by the door as if they were running for the door and people were coming 
in.

'So I think they were 
ambushed in some way and people were running into the house trying to 
kill them and they didn't have a chance.'

The
 team are now creating computerised 3-D models of the fort to 
reconstruct the crime scene — in the hope of solving the mystery. They 
have gone over the site collecting all precious metals to avoid modern 
plundering.

Lund University 
archaeologist Nicoló Dell’Unto explains: 'Using 3D-modeling gives us the
 unprecedented opportunity to see all the bodies simultaneously, even 
though the skeletons were removed one by one'.

Human bones have been found in other parts of the fort, making it highly likely that many more bodies are yet to be dug out.

The Roman city of Pompeii was destroyed when the volcano Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79 showering in 20ft (6m) of superheated ash.

The ash effectively preserved the city and enabled archaeologists to create plaster casts of many of the victims, captured in their death throes.
