A mother who gave birth when she was just 24 weeks pregnant had to wait five weeks to cuddle her daughter because the baby was so small her head was the size of a satsuma.

Chloe Dolby, 26, went into labour on New Years’ Eve last year when she was only just over halfway through her pregnancy term.

When little Maya was born, she weighed just 1Ib 3ozs, and was kept in hospital for almost five months.

'Miracle': Baby Maya Dolby was born four months premature on New Year's Eve last year and was so small that her head was the size of a satsuma

'Miracle': Parents Chloe and David Dolby hold baby Maya. At birth, her head was the size of a satsuma and her grandmother knitted her a tiny hat

Maya’s head was the size of a satsuma and her hand barely covered the surface of her father David’s fingernail.

Mrs Dolby, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, said: 'She was absolutely tiny. The hardest part was not being allowed to pick her up and cuddle - I had to wait five-and-a-half weeks to do that.

'We were allowed to touch her through the incubator but I was always worried I would pass something on to her.'

Mrs Dolby’s grandmother, Rhonda Bruce, 77, knitted a tiny hat for Maya as no clothing available to buy would fit her.

When
the mother-to-be had a mild stomach ache on December 31, she thought it
was something she had eaten, and did not imagine she was about to meet 
her daughter.

But, within just two hours, Mrs Dolby was at Dewsbury and District Hospital in labour, hoping her new arrival would survive.

She said: 'When I first went into labour, it never entered my head she might come early.

'David and I didn’t say anything to each other about what could happen to our baby but we were both terrified.

'We both knew what the odds were that she wouldn’t survive but we just tried to stay positive. The doctors were really calm and reassuring - I presume because they wanted to stop me from worrying.

'When Maya was born, she was taken away straight away and worked on by the team. She was just so tiny. I just held my husband’s hand and prayed.'

Maya was given a blood transfusion - 
one of nine she had in four months, and it is thanks to the quick and 
skilled delivery team at Dewsbury and District Hospital that Maya is alive today. She was then moved straight to Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) for more specialised care.

Mr Dolby, a 31-year-old plumber, said: 'I went in the ambulance with Maya to LGI.

'Doctors were working on her right through the journey - the longest of my life.

'It
was surreal seeing everyone out on New Years’ Eve dressed up and having
a good time, and I was in an ambulance pleading for our little girl to 
be OK.

'We were lucky to 
get a place at LGI but we are so grateful we did - the medical staff 
there were incredible, what could have happened without them isn’t worth
thinking about.'

While at LGI, Maya was given heart surgery to close a valve and allow more blood to flow properly, giving her more oxygen.

She also had laser eye surgery to save her sight as the blood vessels in her eyes were not properly developed.

Mrs
Dolby said: 'Despite Maya having to go through all the operations and 
transfusions, we were more worried we would be told she had caught an 
infection.

'So many babies 
look like they’re getting there and then they pick up an infection and 
they don’t survive. It was just a terrifying time.'

Bonding: Mrs Dolby gave birth at 24 weeks just hours after she started to suffer a mild stomach ache

Maya was discharged from hospital on April 9 - ten days before Mrs Dolby’s original due date - something rarely heard of in cases of such premature babies.

Mrs Dolby said: 'It was such a relief to bring Maya home - it was such an intense environment on the ward. I would find myself just sitting and looking at the monitors, it was so stressful.'

The proud parents would visit their tiny daughter twice each day to give her the encouragement to get better.

Mr Dolby said: 'Our families were amazing throughout the whole time we were in hospital with Maya. Our parents would go in and siblings. Maya definitely knew how much she was loved.

'It took it out of all of us - we just didn’t know what to expect. I think our families found it hard because it was such a scary environment.'

But eight-month-old Maya is now back at home and out of the woods.

Mrs Dolby said: 'I looked after her in hospital but we had to be careful when she first came out because she was still vulnerable.

'We hadn’t bought any stuff so we had to go out and buy everything in about a week.

'It feels good to have her with me all the time and be able to treat her like a normal baby.

'She’s our little miracle.'
