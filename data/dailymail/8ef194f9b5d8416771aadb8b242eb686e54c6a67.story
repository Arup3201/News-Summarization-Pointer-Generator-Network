American teenager Madison Keys overcame a major injury scare to qualify for the first grand slam semi-final of her career and end the hopes of the woman who inspired her to take up the game.

Keys needed lengthy treatment off the court and went on to lose the second set to her idol Venus Williams in their quarter-final on Rod Laver Arena.

However, the 19-year-old regrouped and twice came from a break down in the decider to win 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 and set up a last-four clash with either top seed Serena Williams.

Venus Williams was bidding to become the oldest semi-finalist at a grand slam since 39-year-old Billie Jean King at Wimbledon in 1983, the 34-year-old having reached her first quarter-final since Wimbledon 2010.

Keys had never previously gone beyond the third round and feared the thigh problem which forced her to retire at that stage of Wimbledon last year would again ruin her prospects in Melbourne.

The world No 35 had taken the opening set in 29 minutes but fell 4-1 behind in the second and then left the court to receive treatment on an injury to her left thigh.

Keys returned to the court with the thigh heavily strapped but proceeded to win the next three games before Williams broke back and then served out for the set to force a decider.

Seven-time grand slam singles winner Williams twice moved a break up but Keys began to find winners from all over the court and won the last three games to win a rollercoaster match featuring 12 breaks of serve.

'It's not nearly as bad as Wimbledon but it was a nightmare,' Keys said of her injury. 'Obviously I don't want this to happen again. It was a bit overwhelming but thankfully the pain meds kicked in.

'I'm very happy that I am into the semi-finals but the moment is definitely sweeter being able to play Venus.'
