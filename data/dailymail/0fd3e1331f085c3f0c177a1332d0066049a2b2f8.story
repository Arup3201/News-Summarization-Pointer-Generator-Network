From coffee to camomile: ScentRhythm concept watch releases smells to suit different times of day

The idea of a watch constantly buzzing with reminders for appointments and workouts as well as texts and emails might prove stressful and unwelcome for some people.

But now a concept for a different type of smartwatch promises to measure the passing of time in a number of scents, rather than beeps and buzzes.

One computer expert has created a prototype watch that includes four dinky perfume bottles, which release fragrances associated with different times of the day.

Aisen Caro Chacin, a physical computing lecturer at at the Parsons New School for Design, New York, created the less-stressful smartwatch, which is designed to gently intensify the sense of time.

The ScentRhythm watch is bulky as it features four perfume bottles as well as the mechanics to release the scents.

It is intended to feature fragrances associated with waking up, relaxing, times of activity and sleeping.

Each of the four glass vials holds a millilitre of scent and every six hours the smartwatch releases a whiff of the perfume selected for the specific time of day, Popsci reported.

For example, a wearer could be woken up by the smell of freshly brewed coffee or a whiff of camomile to relax before falling asleep.

The watch does not have a conventional clock face but instead emits suitable scents every six hours to draw the wearer's attention to the passing of time.

The design includes four vials of perfume associated with waking up, relaxing, activity and sleeping.

It wafts scents periodically using piexoelectric atomisers that sit above each vial of perfume and emit a smell when they are triggered by the watch's electronics.

The atomisers vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies inaudible to the vast majority of humans, to convert a tiny amount of the scented liquid into vapour.

The smartwatch’s electronics are powered by a lithium-ion battery that can be charged using a micro-USB port and typically last 24 hours on a single charge.

The watch is a concept and is not expected to go on sale in the near future.

‘Olfaction and chronoception are both 
chemical senses, so I thought it would be interesting to map them onto 
one another,’ Ms Chacin said.

‘This device attempts to keep a chemical watch on the circadian rhythm [the body’s daily 24 hour cycle] by administering fragrance and supplement concoctions associated with the daily activity of the moment to promote the production of certain neurotransmitters, such as chamomile and melatonin during sleep, espresso and caffeine during the awaken state,’ she wrote on her website.

The watch is a concept and is not expected to go on sale in the near future.

Different scents are designed to stimulate certain hormones at different times of day - for example, camomile perfume is designed to get a person ready for sleep

The smartwatch packs in plenty of technology but is designed to be less stressful than many smart wearable offerings
