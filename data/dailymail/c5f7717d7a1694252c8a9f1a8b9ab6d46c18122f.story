A serial charity box thief has been jailed for the fifth time after raiding a collection tin for Great Ormond Hospital.

Carl Mason, 32, has racked up more than 100 offences - and after stealing cash from so many charity boxes, he admitted the petty thefts had become 'second nature' to him.

The unemployed father-of-three, from Burnley in Lancashire, has stolen from well-known causes including the Poppy Appeal, Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) and the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.

Police described Mason - who would snatch collection tins while loitering in shops, banks and pubs and then spend the money on his heroin habit - as 'callous, despicable and beneath contempt'. 

They added he had 'taken advantage of the goodwill of his local communities.'

Mason even stole Poppy Appeal tins on the day the country prepared to hold a two minute silence for Armistice Day.

His latest thefts occurred just days after he was freed early from one of his custodial sentences.

It involved him using special cutters to saw through the straps holding the tins down in shops and a doctors' surgery.

He was jailed for a year in 2011 and was handed a six-month sentence in 2012. 

On Friday, Mason was given another 28 days in jail by Pennine magistrates after stealing cash boxes raising money for patients at a hospice, as well as the Poppy Appeal again. 

He admitted three charges of theft and asked for two offences to be considered.

Four of the charity boxes were collecting money for Pendleside Hospice in Reedley, Burnley, and one, snatched from a medical practice, was said to contain a ' substantial amount of money.'  

Tracy Yates, prosecuting, said in November, Mason took a Poppy Appeal box from Winckleys Sandwich and Coffee Bar in Preston. Police identified him from CCTV footage.

A week later, Mason pinched a collection tin from the reception of a doctors' surgery on Yorkshire Street in Burnley.

Police watched the CCTV footage and saw Mason moving his arms in a sawing motion before leaving with something hidden inside his jacket.

Ms Yates said on November 23, Mason struck at Pratts News on Padiham Road, Burnley, cutting through the straps attaching the box to the counter.

And on December 1, Mason took a box from Bailey and Garrett chemist on Rosegrove Lane, Burnley.

The prosecutor said: 'CCTV footage again showed the defendant cutting the straps attaching the box to the counter.' 

Three days later, Mason was seen on CCTV at Todd Pharmacy, Burnley Road, Padiham, producing some cutters from his pocket before using them on the strings attached to the box. He then hid the tin and left.

Ms Yates added Mason was interviewed about the offences and told police his heroin habit had 'rocketed.'

'He said he was ashamed of his actions and didn't want to hurt anyone.' 

She added the defendant said he couldn't recall the thefts at the two chemist shops, but said it was 'his nature' to commit that type of offence.

'He was shown the footage from Todd Pharmacy and at that point he became quite emotional and couldn't watch it any longer. He said he had got himself in a mess and couldn't get himself out of it.' 

Mason had 113 previous offences on his record, including a year long jail term in 2011.

He was jailed again in April for stealing charity boxes - three months after receiving a suspended sentence for a similar theft. 

In August, while serving the term, he appeared from custody via video link at Preston Magistrates Court and was given a 12 month conditional discharge after owning up to stealing charity boxes for Marie Curie and Dogs for the Disabled.

Mason had 113 previous offences on his record, including a year-long jail term in 2011 and a six-month sentence the following year

His latest thefts occurred just days after he was freed early from one of his custodial sentences

In October, he received his fifth prison term when he was given 12 weeks for taking a collecting tin for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital from the Queen Victoria Pub in Burnley, on September 28.

Graeme Parkinson, defending, said when Mason was released from prison in August, he had nowhere to go, got back in with his old associates and started using illicit substances again. 

He was then returned to custody.

After he was freed on November 7, Mr Parkinson said accommodation found for him was unsuitable, he had problems sorting out his benefits and again had difficulties staying clear of drugs.

He added: 'He tells me that he has finally managed to have his benefits sorted out and he has managed to find more suitable accommodation.

'He has taken advantage of the services which are offered by Inspire (the drugs and alcohol service) and he is now being prescribed methadone. 

'He says that in recent times, he has managed to stabilise his life.'

Mr Parkinson said Mason recollected some of the offences, but didn't remember others.
