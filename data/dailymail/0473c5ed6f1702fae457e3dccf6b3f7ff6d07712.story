At first glance, the letters read like those sent by any other travelling businessman to his much-loved wife and daughter.

‘In the next few days I’ll be in Lublin, Zamosc, Auschwitz, Lviv and then in the new headquarters,’ writes the 41-year-old chief executive officer of a massive pan-European corporation.

‘I’m curious if and how I will be able to phone, as it will probably be around 2,000 kilometres to Gmund. All the best, have a nice trip and enjoy your days with our little daughter. Many warm greetings and kisses!’

There is one word that immediately leaps out in this otherwise banal missive. That word is, of course, ‘Auschwitz’. For the writer of the letter is no ordinary executive on the road.

It was in fact written by one of the most notorious mass murderers in history — Heinrich Himmler.

As head of the dreaded SS, Hitler’s Nazi guard, Himmler’s ‘business’ was to orchestrate the mass shootings and gassings of millions of Jews and other ‘undesirables’.

When he wrote the letter to his wife Marga, a nurse, and their daughter Gudrun in July 1942, Himmler was about to embark on a tour during which he would personally oversee the repellent and horrific ‘work’ that he ordered his men to carry out.

Just a few weeks later, while watching a massacre in Minsk, the face and coat of this proud family man were spattered with the blood of a Jew who had just been shot.

‘He [Himmler] wasn’t actually sick,’ one witness recalled, ‘but he was heaving and turned round and swayed and then I had to jump forward and hold him steady and then I led him away from the grave.’

This chilling contrast between the public, murderous life of Himmler and the affectionate details of his private, domestic life came to light yesterday with the publication by the German newspaper Die Welt of a cache of hitherto unseen letters written by the SS leader to his family.

Their release has been timed to coincide with today’s Holocaust Memorial Day. The papers had lain hidden for several decades in Tel Aviv, having been bought by an Israeli Holocaust survivor called Chaim Rosenthal in the final days of World War II.

In 2007, Rosenthal sold the collection to a film-maker called Vanessa Lapa, who will shortly release a documentary about the letters, which she is calling The Decent.

The title is an ironic reference to a notorious speech Himmler made in October 1943, in which he spoke openly about exterminating the Jews.

‘Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other,’ he told a Nazi gathering, ‘when there are 500 or when there are a 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person — with exceptions due to human weaknesses — has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of.’

The notion that Himmler, despite ordering a genocide, could have remained ‘decent’, is clearly absurd, but as the letters show, the SS leader continued to believe himself to be a loving family man.

The letters reveal Himmler as seemingly able to separate the two sides of his personality.

Just a few days before Nazi Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Himmler spent a few halcyon days with his family in an idyllic part of Upper Bavaria. As the three of them explored the beautiful countryside, Himmler did not mention to either his wife or daughter that his beloved SS and the German armed forces were about to mobilise on an epic scale in order to try to defeat Stalin.

Himmler’s wife only seemed to have learned about the attack later when the news became public.

‘Now we are at war again,’ she wrote to her husband on June 22. ‘I knew it. I didn’t sleep well at all.’

While millions suffered the privations brought about by the war, the Himmlers continued to have a taste for the high life.

‘There is still one can of caviar in the fridge,’ Marga told her husband. ‘Take it.’

The collection of documents also contains Marga’s wartime account book, which shows that she was spending extravagantly — about ten times more than the average household.

However, while his wife concerned herself with domesticity, it seems that Himmler’s daughter, Gudrun, then 11 years old, was more perceptive in her analysis of the political situation. She too wrote to Himmler on June 22 that year.

‘It’s terrible that we are going to war with Russia,’ she declared. ‘They were our allies after all. Russia is sooo big. The struggle will be very difficult if we want to conquer all of Russia.’

It is not known whether Himmler replied to that letter, but it seems likely that he did not, as a few days later, he wrote to Marga, apologising for forgetting their wedding anniversary ‘for the first time’.

‘There is quite a lot going on these days,’ he admitted. ‘The fighting is very hard, especially for the SS.’

Although Himmler and his wife still appeared to be on good terms, the newly uncovered letters provide a fascinating insight into how the couple’s relationship had, in fact, deteriorated.

Their early correspondence from the days of the courtship in the late Twenties is romantic — and even sometimes sexual — in tone.

Himmler would call himself a ‘roughneck’, and he referred to himself as a ruthless street fighter. He was proud of this roughness in the bedroom. ‘I am so lucky to have such a good bad man who loves his bad wife as much as she loves him,’ Marga wrote.

The couple would speak of sex as being ‘revenge’.

‘I’m for nothing but “Revenge” all the time,’ he wrote to Marga in January 1928 when he was on a train to Munich.

‘Remember “Revenge”,’ Marga insisted in April that year. ‘My black soul is thinking up the most impossible things.’

But over the years, the couple’s passion cooled to such an extent that, by 1938, Himmler had found himself a mistress — his secretary — with whom he had two children. Himmler also adopted a son, Gerhard, with Marga, though the boy did not take his surname.

Instead of addressing Marga as ‘my dear sweetheart’, he started to write to her — somewhat bizarrely — as ‘Dear Mummy’.

Nevertheless, Himmler did still care for his wife and daughter. Throughout the war, he would send them luxurious treats. In May 1942, for example, he sent Marga and Gudrun 150 tulips from Holland.

‘Striped, jagged, two colours, one colour,’ he wrote. ‘The kind you cannot find here.’

Even when the couple drifted apart, there was one belief that they continued to share fiercely: their hatred for the Jews.

In her early letters, Marga complained about how ‘Jewish scum’ scared her, and how she resented having to deal with a Jewish doctor, Bernhard Hauschild, with whom she co-owned a clinic in Berlin.

‘This Hauschild!’ she exclaimed in May 1928. ‘A Jew will always be a Jew!’ ‘Don’t get worked up about the Jews, dear, dear woman,’ Himmler replied, ‘if I could only help you.’

A decade later, her husband’s fellow Nazis would indeed ‘help’ the likes of Marga, by organising the brutal Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass, in November 1938, which saw 90 Jews killed, and thousands of synagogues and Jewish businesses destroyed.

Marga was delighted, but, like her husband, believed the SS could  go further.

‘This thing with the Jews,’ she wrote, ‘when will this scum leave us so that we can lead a happy life?’

But apart from these references to the Jews, what is remarkable about the letters is that they make so little mention of Himmler’s murderous day job.

The letters show no sense of remorse or regret. What they do reveal is that Himmler displayed what some psychiatrists call ‘doubling’, in which people are able to commit extraordinarily evil acts while all the time believing themselves to be essentially good, or in Himmler’s own self-deluded word, ‘decent’.

The letter that captures this best is a short one. It simply states: ‘I’m off to Auschwitz. Kisses, Yours, Heini.’

For the head of the SS, heading off to Auschwitz was no more remarkable than a day trip to visit a regional branch of the office or a factory floor.
