A North Carolina woman has been jailed for at least six years after faking her pregnancy so she could befriend a 22-year-old mother, before abducting her one-month-old baby daughter.

Andrea Endara, 27, spent months pretending to be pregnant in 2012, including preparing her home in Charlotte for a baby, faking a bump and even attending a baby shower in her own honor. 

She then befriended Carla Paz - the mother of the baby and a four-year-old child - before offering to drive her to work. But instead, she attacked Paz with a tire iron and pepper spray, prosecutors said.

Jailed: Andrea Endara (pictured in her police mug shot), 27, has been jailed for at least six years after faking her pregnancy so she could befriend 22-year-old Carla Paz, before abducting her one-month-old daughter

Victim: Endara, who spent months pretending to be pregnant, kidnapped Paz's little girl (pictured). The infant was found unharmed, with Endara's boyfriend, by homicide detectives at an apartment complex in Charlotte

After allegedly threatening the victim with a knife, Endara then drove her and her two children to an apartment complex, where she grabbed hold of the youngsters and went inside, WBTV reported.

Although she shortly returned with the four-year-old child, she left the little girl inside. She then drove Paz and the youngster back to their home, while assaulting the mother the entire time, it was said.

At around 2am the following day, homicide detectives found the baby unharmed, with Endara's boyfriend, in an apartment unit at the Carmel On Providence Apartments on Knob Oak Lane.

Now, Endara has been sentenced to three consecutive prison terms after being found guilty of child abduction and two counts of second-degree kidnapping, according to Fox 8 News.

Safe return: The convict befriended Carla Paz - also the mother of a four-year-old child - in 2012, before offering to drive her to work. Above, Paz is pictured with her husband and rescued baby girl following Endara's arrest

Looking to the future: However, instead of driving Paz to work, Endara attacked her with a tire iron and pepper spray, prosecutors said. She then 'threatened the victim with a knife', before driving her and her children away

The terms are 20-33 months, 31-98 months and 25-42 months in length. This means Endara will serve a minimum sentence of six years. She could be imprisoned for up to 14 years. 

When she is released, the convict will be forced to register with the Sex Offender & Public Protection Registration Program for 30 years.

During the abduction on May 1, 2012, Endara agreed to take Paz and her four-year-old child home on the condition that she did not disclose details of the crime to her husband, officials said.

After offering to take her to work that evening, 'Endara pulled a knife on the mother and told her that she was taking her children,' CMPD Captain Rod Golding told 10 News at the time.

'She agreed to take her back [home] on condition the mother not tell her husband what happened,' he added. 'And to tell her husband the [baby] was kidnapped by two black males in a gray car.'

However, the husband had already contacted police to tell them that his wife and his two children had been kidnapped. Officers located the baby at the Carmel On Providence apartment hours later.

Endara's boyfriend, who opened the door, admitted straight away 'he had the one-month-old baby'. He later told police he had believed his girlfriend was pregnant and wanted nothing to do with her.

Although medics were called to the scene, the infant was found to be fine 'except for a wet diaper'.

The jury could not reach a decision on assault charges against Endara.
