Steve Jobs’ dreams of a futuristic new Cupertino Apple headquarters have come one step closer to being realized as execs recently unveiled a giant mock-up their founder’s dream campus.

Nicknamed the Apple spaceship, the building shares the same innovative design as the company’s groundbreaking products thanks to a little help from the same creative minds that brought the world the iPhone and iPad.

The ring-shaped structure, which encloses a tree-filled arboretum, was Jobs’ brainchild. After his death, Apple design guru Jony Ive took over with the help of famed architect Sir Norman Foster.

On Tuesday, executives will ask Cupertino, California’s city council to approve their ambitious plans.

‘You see the energy and the love and the attention to detail that we've put into this,’ said Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer at an unveiling of the top secret spaceship plans. ‘We have treated this project just as we would any Apple product. And this will be a place for the most creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades to come.’

The circular, four story building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide.

Described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut’, it will have a big courtyard in the center and use natural gas as the primary power source.

The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 percent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach, and on-site recycling.

‘This will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world,'’ said Apple’s Whisenhunt.

In the center will be an enclosed arboretum and orchard complete with thousands of fruit, oak, and olive trees according to the San Jose Mercury-News.

‘We love California, and by adding over 2,500 new and indigenous trees that truly belong here,’ Oppenheimer said, ‘we're bringing back the beautiful orchards that once made up this valley.’

Surrounding the building, will be even more green space as part of the planned 80 percent open space and parkland.

Currently, the 175-acre site is 80 percent asphalt and the buildings that once housed Hewlett-Packard.

'The
concept of the building,' Oppenheimer said, 'is collaboration and 
fluidity. It'll provide a very open-spaced system, so that at one point 
in the day you may be in offices on one side of the circle and find 
yourself on the other side later that day.'

The plans specify that the circle will take 14 minutes to walk completely around.

Apple says thousands of trees will be planted in its central courtyard, including apples, apricots, olives, and oaks

Green: Above the parking structure and much of the building will be solar panels. There are also plans for 70 percent natural ventilation, LED lighting, and on-sight recycling

The building will also have a four-story atrium as its cafeteria and solar panels running all around the circumference of its roof.

Apple’s current office building at 1 Infinite Loop will remain and the new offices will down the road will be built in addition to the current offices, which house around 2,600 workers.

When Jobs first presented the plans in 2011, he said his firm was 'growing like a weed.’

'We do have a shot at building the best office building in the world,’ he said. ‘I really do think architecture students will come here to see this.'

Apple executives will meet with Cupertino officials October 15. The city council takes the plans to a final vote November 19.
