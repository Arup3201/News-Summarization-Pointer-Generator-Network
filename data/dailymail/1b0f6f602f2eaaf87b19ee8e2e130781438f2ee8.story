It was just a harmless pasta recipe posted on to Twitter, but the name of the dish forced TV chef Nigella Lawson to insist there was 'no agenda' behind her tweet.

The celebrity chef posted the recipe for 'slut's spaghetti', known in Italian as 'pasta alla puttanesca', as her recipe of the day along with the phrase 'Do I need to say anything more?'.

But just moments later she posted again insisting: 'Folks: no agenda behind 
#recipeoftheday! Slut's Spaghetti an old fave of mine.'

Her tweets came shortly after her ex-husband's new companion, Trinny Woodall, made a tasteless joke that appeared to refer to Nigella, and on the day that her former aide's affair with a married man was revealed.

Nigella's tweets sparked speculation as to whether Miss Lawson was referring to anybody in particular.

It was revealed today that one of her former PAs cleared of fraud was seeing a
 man who has recently left his wife.

Meanwhile, her former husband Charles 
Saatchi's new companion Trinny Woodall made what appeared to be a 
tasteless joke at her expense.

Writing
 about turning 50 on the high50 website last night, Ms Woodall said: 
'It’s great that, at 50, life can still grab you by the throat and shake
 you up.'

Miss
 Lawson's Twitter message linked to her website which included the 
ingredients and a colourful description of the fiery dish.

It read: 'Well how could I resist this translation of pasta alla puttanesca, whore's pasta as it usually is described in English?

'The general consensus seems to be that this is the sort of dish cooks up by slatterns who don't go to the market to get their ingredients fresh, but are happy to use stuff out of jars and tins.

'I hold my hands up to that. Or maybe 
one should just attribute the name gamely to the fiery tang and robust 
saltiness of the dish?'

Nigella Lawson posted a recipe for 'slut's spaghetti' to her Twitter feed today

A short while after the initial message was posted she tweeted this message

The 
message was retweeted dozens of times with one user Hassinator69 saying:
 'It's nothing to do with using jars or sauces but I'm sure you know 
this and are just being polite.'

A
 short while after that message was posted Miss Lawson posted a reply 
which read: 'Folks: no agenda behind #recipeoftheday! Slut's Spaghetti 
an old fave of mine.'

It was
 revealed today Francesca Grillo, 35 — cleared of swindling £685,000 
from the celebrity chef in December — hooked up with former policeman 
Adam Denton-Beaumont after they met through friends.

The 35-year-old ex constable has 
recently split from his hospital consultant wife Ruth — and supported 
Francesca and her sister Elisabetta, 41, during the trial.

The Grillo sisters had been accused of spending £685,000 on credit cards given to them by Nigella Lawson (left) and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi (right)

Francesca
 described Mr Denton-Beaumont, who is now a construction manager, as her 'rock' adding
 how he had given her and her sister 'lots of solid advice and support'.

She told The Sun: 'We only got together romantically in the last few weeks and are very happy.'

Mr Denton-Beaumont added the pair had helped each other through 'tough times'.

Mr
 Denton-Beaumont's wife Ruth, 33, who said she separated from her husband three weeks ago, has claimed Francesca stole him.

She said: 'For a long while I 
suspected they'd been having an affair. He's denied it.'

Ingredients for the pasta dish include anchovies, garlic, chilli flakes and olives as well as spaghetti.
