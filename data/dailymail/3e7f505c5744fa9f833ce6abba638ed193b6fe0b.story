Actor Peter Fonda is suing designers Dolce & Gabbana and retail chain Nordstrom for $3million over a t-shirt with his face on it.

The 73-year-old star filed legal proceedings against the firms claiming they have been illegally selling garments bearing his image without his permission.

The t-shirt in question is printed with a picture of Fonda as biker Wyatt in the iconic 1969 movie Easy Rider.

Lawsuit: The t-shirt, seen left, which is printed with the image of Peter Fonda in the 1969 film Easy Rider, has prompted the actor, seen right, to launch legal proceedings against D&G and retailer Nordstrom

The law suit filed by Fonda's lawyer in Los Angeles last week claims Italian fashion design duo Dolce & Gabbana 'knowingly manufactured, distributed and sold, or licensed for sale' t-shirts with his image on without his permission.

Nordstrom is listed in the suit for allegedly selling the t-shirts, according to a report on thewrap.com.

'At no time did Defendants seek permission from Plaintiff to use his name, likeness and image for commercial purposes on the T-Shirts or any other apparel that Defendants intended to or did manufacture, license, sell, distribute or advertise in any known media,' the lawsuit reads.

He is seeking financial compensation 'in an amount not less than' £3million.

Dolce & Gabbana declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.

Controversy: Legal proceedings against the design duo come after they temporarily closed their Milan stores in protest at being 'pilloried' over their tax evasion convictions

Nordstrom has said it is aware of the issue and is 'reaching out to our vendor to determine next steps'.

The lawsuit throws Dolce & Gabbana into the spotlight once again, after they closed their Milan stores last week in protest at being 'pilloried' over their tax evasion convictions.

Signs reading 'closed for indignation' were pinned up in the windows of the designers' shops in Milan, the city where the pair showed their first collection in 1985.

Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were given 20-month jail terms for evading taxes on royalties of around a billion euros (£860million) by selling their brand to a Luxembourg-based holding company in 2004.

Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are furious over 'attacks from public ministers and the media pillory' over their tax eviction convictions, they said

They are not yet wearing prison stripes, as, under the Italian justice system, anyone found guilty of a crime is automatically granted at least two appeals.

However, Milan’s city administration said the pair, who count Kylie Minogue and Kate Moss among their celebrity fans, would no longer be able to use any public spaces for their shows as they were bad for the city’s image.

Commercial director Franco D’Alfonso said: ‘Any time designers Dolce and Gabbana submit requests for public space, the council must keep the doors closed to them.

‘Their fashion is seen as excellent the world over, but we do not need tax evaders to promote us.’

The designers are hitting back at Milan council after a city councillor said the duo not be allowed to show their collections in Milan's communal spaces after their convictions

The designers afterwards reacted with rage. In a furious tweet Stefano Gabbana wrote: ‘Milan council: You’re disgusting!!!’

And today its Milan stores, Martini bar and restaurant, Gold, were shut in protest, exhibiting signs in the windows saying ‘Closed in indignation’, in both English and Italian.

'We are no longer willing to suffer undeservedly the accusations of the financial police and the income revenue authority, attacks from public ministers and the media pillory we have already been subjected to for years,' they said in a statement.

The pair said they would continue to pay their more than 250 employees in Milan during the temporary closure of all their nine shops in the city.

The conviction follows an investigation that began in 2008 as part of a tax-avoidance crackdown amid the eurozone crisis.

The two founders of the iconic 
fashion house, with six others, evaded taxes for several years after 
setting up a front company in Luxembourg.

The
creators of the world-famous Dolce & Gabbana brand who are expected
to appeal, were also ordered to pay compensation to Italy’s tax 
authorities.

Dolce & Gabbana will appeal their sentences and the company appears to conducting business as usual, with an advert featuring Matthew McConaughey and Scarlett Johansson being filmed earlier this month

When the charges were first made public, Stefano Gabbana condemned the Italian tax authorities as ‘thieves’, and threatened to leave the country.

Tax evasion is thought to cost Italy €200billion (£170billion) a year.

Several cases involving celebrities have led to out-of-court settlements; in 2000 opera singer Luciano Pavarotti paid 24billion lira (£8million) in back taxes, while MOTOGP champion Valentino Rossi agreed to hand over €39million (£33million) in 2008.
