Amputees only: The director of series Games of Thrones which stars Peter Dinklage (pictured) are looking for leg only, male amputees

The Game of Thrones director is looking for leg only, male amputees for a famous scene of the epic television series.

Filming has started in Northern Ireland and according to a casting notice, the show is looking for disabled actors to act as extras in a bloody battle scene known as ‘the red wedding'.

Based on a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the scene is considered to be a major turning point in the five-book epic.

The popular series has been one of the most expensive projects ever done, even by HBO’s pricey standards.

According to the New York Post, the casting notice reads ‘Seeking LEG ONLY, MALE AMPUTEES’ on an Irish casting website posted this week.

Interested actors must send ‘a clear description regarding where your limb is missing e.g. at knee, at ankle, etc.’

It continues: ‘You must be OK and comfortable with filming a scene within the context of a battle where your leg has been injured.

‘Prosthetic makeup will be applied as though your leg has newly been severed. 

‘We understand that this is not for everyone, so please only apply if you are happy to participate.’

The climactic scene, if staged according to the novels, will require hundreds of extras including musicians.

The notice also reads: ‘Seeking MALE only cellists.

Bloody battle: The disabled actors are needed for a massacre scene filmed in Northern Ireland in the third season of the popular show which has also been filmed in Dubrovnik, Croatia (pictured is Charles Dance and crew filming earlier this month)

‘Ideally men with medieval or period faces (i.e. long hair & beard) but not essential.’

The third season is set to be released next March and pay cable network HBO have announced that it plans to split the third book of the series, ‘The Storm of Swords’, into two seasons.

Filming has been taking place in various locations around the world to fill in for the fictional land of Westeros, including Ireland and Iceland. The Croatian city of Dubrovnik is the location for King’s Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms.
