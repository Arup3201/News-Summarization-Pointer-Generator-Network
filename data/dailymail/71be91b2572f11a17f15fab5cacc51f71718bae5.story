A major operation was under way last night to remove the bodies of 17 pilot whales which died in a mass stranding off the coast.

The whales, including three calves, perished despite hours of frantic efforts by rescue workers to keep them alive until they could be released back out to sea.

The stricken animals were hosed down and covered in wet blankets and sheets for several hours to try to cool them down and keep them hydrated until high tide.

Horror: Dead pilot whales litter the shore as rescue workers survey the scene after the mass stranding near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife

Grim: Emergency Service workers were unable to help save 16 pilot whales after they beached near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife

By the time it arrived at 4.30pm on 
Sunday, only ten of the whales – beached at Fife in Scotland for around 
12 hours – had survived.

They were re-floated, but one more of the group died yesterday on rocks nearby.

Last night the remaining nine were 
seen off North Queensferry, heading westwards.  This is shallow water 
where they may be gathering strength following their ordeal.

But rescuers warned of a great risk 
to the whales if they remained there at low tide and were hoping they 
would head north to deeper waters.

An investigation is under way to try and find out what caused the whales to beach.

Shocking: The scene of horror that greeted rescuers was described as 'like an aircraft crash' as more than a dozen whales lay dead on the beach near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife

Mr Jack, who was among 50 people
who helped rescue and re-float the 10 whales, said: 'It has been quite traumatic 
for the pod, members of every generation have gone and they will have to
re-build their pod.

'I would imagine there would be a period of grieving, they are very intelligent animals and they will possibly grieve.'

He
added: 'They are very sociable animals and they have a very, very tight
family bond and if one comes ashore they will all come ashore.'

He said: 'The pod will always try to 
protect its sick, it's a natural instinct for a sick whale to come 
ashore, we think, as they can't lift their head to breathe in the water,
and if they're on land they don't need to struggle. It's only a theory.
But the rest of the pod will follow suit. They are very sociable 
animals.'

Mr Jack said the pilot whales, some 
of which were 20-feet long, can only survive for about 12 hours on the 
shore before they start to die.

He explained: 'Beyond 12 hours they 
are no longer viable, their muscles break down and that releases toxins 
in their internal organs.'

He said: 'It was mayhem, we had to forget the dead ones and concentrate on what we could save. They seemed to sense that we were there to help them. They never showed any aggression.

Help: Members of the emergency services attempt to refloat pilot whales after they beached near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife

'Once we righted them they were okay. They swam away so fast we couldn't keep up with them.'

Vets used wet blankets and sheets to keep the 10 whales alive, give them shade and keep them cool. Two breached again but were re-floated by scores of volunteers.

The BDMLR said in a statement this morning: 'All ten whales have now been reported as having left the harbour. The two that had turned back re-stranded but BDMLR volunteers were able to get them straight back into the water. 

'One was in difficulty and listing to
one side, but the whales from the main pod swam beside it, physically 
keeping it upright until it could right itself. Once it was balanced and
able to swim without support, the pod all swam strongly out towards 
open water.

'It is 
hoped that they will turn north soon to return to the deeper water but 
observers along the southern coast of the Forth are on alert if they are
seen again.'

Lifesavers: Teams of specialist vets steer a stranded pilot whale towards deeper water

Post-mortem examinations will now be carried out to find out what caused them to come ashore.

A coastguard spokesman said: 'Vets 
from the Scottish Agricultural College were at the beach last night and 
will come back this morning to carry out post-mortem examinations on the
dead whales to try to find out what caused them to come in to shore.

'They will be looking to see if any 
of the whales were ill or injured and came to shallow water for a rest. 
Once they have found out what they can it will be up to the council to 
remove the carcasses from the beach.'

Forth Coastguard was alerted to the incident shortly after 7am, with initial reports suggesting a mass stranding of dolphins.

Teams
of volunteer medics from BDMLR were sent to the area, with specialist 
rescue pontoons being moved to the location from across Scotland, 
Newcastle and Cumbria.

Frantic efforts: Emergency services attempt to rescue a large number of pilot whales who became stranded

Major operation: Dozens of specialist vets waded into the water in an attempt to refloat some of the surviving whales

Ordeal: Despite the best efforts of emergency services sixteen of the whales which beached did not survive their ordeal

Gareth Norman, area co-ordinator for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said the scene was 'like an aircraft crash.'

The group of 26 pilot whales became stranded at Pittenweem, near St Andrews, Scotland

'It was like an aircraft crash scene.
We had 24 medics here with our pontoons, there are four vets, 
Anstruther RNLI, police, coastguards - everybody did everything they 
could to save those whales.

'Pilot whales have a habit of beaching. One strands and the others tend to stick together.'

A further 24 pilot whales, possibly from the same pod, were in the shallows three miles along the coast at Cellardyke, but have not been seen this morning and are not stranded.

Mr Jack said: 'We are monitoring them - but they have not stranded.

'It has been a fantastic effort by 
what seems hundreds of people.

'We managed to herd the pilot whales back 
out to sea using our pontoons. Two came back but we have got them out 
again.

'We are hopeful all the ten will 
survive - but I would say the chances are 50-50. It is up to the animals
now. People here certainly couldn't have done more - they were 
magnificent.'

The incident drew a large number of 
bystanders to the scene, prompting the coastguard to urge the public to 
stay away to allow rescue teams to carry out their duties.

Many people volunteered to help but were told they could not because of health and safety reasons.

Coastguard teams from St Andrews and Leven, Anstruther lifeboat, and Fife Police also assisted with the incident.

Drama: Crowds gathers to watch the drama unfold as rescuers battled to save the rest of the pod which had stranded at low tide near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife

Carnage: Rescuers were confronted with a grim scene of more than a dozen dead whales - including several young calves - on a beach at Pittenweem, near St Andrews

Rescue bid: Vets from British Divers and Marine Life Rescue were in a race against time to save as many of the beached whales as possible

In July last year 70 pilot whales that stranded in the Kyle of Durness in Sutherland.

The Cetacean Stranding Investigation 
Programme probed the cause of what is believed to have been Scotland's 
largest ever beaching of pilot whales. Some 25 of the 70 whales died.

In May last year, around 60 pilot 
whales appeared in Loch Carnan, South Uist, although they left the loch 
after one of the mammals died. Another dead whale was later found on an 
island in the loch.

A post-mortem examination suggested the first had died of infection.

At the end of October in 2010, other pilot whales almost got stranded in Loch Carnan.
Less than a week later 33 whales, believed to be the same group, were found dead on a beach in Co Donegal in Ireland.

Pilot whales are known to prefer deep water but come inshore to feed on squid, their main food.

Fraught efforts: Teams of specialists tried to keep the stranded mammals alive while pontoons were being deployed to the area to re float them

Battle: Experts fear the final death toll could rise above 13 - despite the valiant efforts of vets
