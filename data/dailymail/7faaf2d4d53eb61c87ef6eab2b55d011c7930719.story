Abducted: Moira Anderson went missing in 1957 and is thought to have been murdered by rapist Alexander Gartshore

The fate of a schoolgirl who disappeared more than 50 years ago remains a mystery after a grave search found no evidence of her remains.

Moira Anderson was 11 when she failed to return home from running an errand in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, in February 1957.

Following a two-day search of a grave plot at Old Monkland cemetery in Coatbridge, chief inspector Kenny McLeod from Strathclyde Police said: 'I can confirm that Moira's remains have not been found.

'Despite today's outcome, the case will remain open.'

It is widely believed that Moira was abducted and murdered, but her body has never been found.

Detectives recently reopened the case, focusing on a family grave plot where they believed it was possible that her body may have been dumped.

Convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, a Coatbridge bus driver who died in 2006, has been connected with the schoolgirl's disappearance.

On Tuesday investigators began excavating the plot of Sinclair Upton, said to have been an acquaintance of Gartshore, to see if the youngster's remains were put there.

The operation was led by Professor Sue Black and a team from the forensic anthropology department at Dundee University.

Mr McLeod said Moira's family has been made aware that searchers had turned up a blank.

Murder investigation: Chief Inspector Kenny Macleod has vowed to carry on the hunt for Moira's body

Moira's sisters were 'hugely 
disappointed' by the blank drawn by detectives but officers leading the 
investigation vowed to carry on the hunt.

Chief Inspector McLeod said: 'This is not the closure that the sisters 
would have wished for but I would like to reiterate that this case is 
not closed.

'Despite today's outcome, the case will remain open. Any further lines of inquiry will be fully investigated.'

Gartshore, who died in 2006, was 
accused of the murder by his own daughter.

It later emerged he told a colleague that Mr Upton had done him a ‘big favour’.

The exhumation was ordered after 
Moira’s sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, launched a petition 
for Mr Upton’s grave to be opened in the hope of finding her remains.

Forensic experts warned they 
faced a sensitive and painstaking task, however, with a total of eight 
people known to have been buried in the plot dating back to 1908. A 
radar survey suggested there may have been an extra body 
there.

Moira was last seen catching a bus on
her way to the local Co-op on an errand for her grandmother in February
1957. Gartshore – a convicted child rapist – has been blamed for 
Moira’s murder by his daughter.

Sandra Brown, in her book Where There 
Is Evil. Shortly before his death in 2006, he told her Moira had haunted
him all his life.

Mrs Brown, 63, set up the Moira 
Anderson Foundation which campaigned for the murder case to be reopened,
a plea granted last year by the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland. At the 
time, Mrs Brown said: ‘I truly believe this grave has secrets to give 
up. We owe it to Moira to open it.’

She believes her father was a paedophile who operated as part of a ring in central Scotland over a number of decades.

Ms
Brown told BBC Radio Scotland earlier today: 'My dad was definitely a 
paedophile - and we're talking about the kind in the same mould as Jimmy
Savile.'

The campaigner said her father told her that Moira got on his bus during a blizzard and he was the last person to see her.

Speaking at the cemetery today, she 
said: 'I'd like to thank the inspector and while I'm very sad about the 
result of the operation, I'm absolutely satisfied that the police view 
that it's not a crime scene is correct.

'Moira's two sisters now know but 
I've explained that although the grave is closed, it's not the end of 
the story and we strongly believe that Moira still wants to be found.

'We've had experts here working with 
the police with the highest integrity but the people who did this crime 
were devious in the extreme and their wickedness knows no bounds.

Hope: The exhumation, which began at the request of Moira's sisters Janet Hart and Marjory Muir, lasted two days

Mystery: Police had hoped to find the remains of Moira Anderson who disappeared while running an errand for her grandmother in 1957

'My belief is that Moira is not far from us but she remains concealed by extremely wicked people.

'It's a difficult day but my thoughts are with the Upton family, who can now hopefully have their family members put to rest.'

Ms
Brown, who set up the Moira Anderson Foundation in 2000 to help victims
of childhood sexual abuse, said at the graveside today: 'Both of 
Moira's sisters are hugely disappointed. It's been a long time and it's a
shame that their hopes are dashed.

'It's not what I would have liked to have happened today but it's certainly not the end of the story.

'Some people might think we've hit a brick wall here but I think we've actually punched through a brick wall.

'Over the last few months Moira's case has been upgraded from a missing person to a murder inquiry.

'It's become a cold case review and in the future there could be further developments.'

The excavation team started work this morning to fill in the grave.

A woman from the Moira Anderson 
Foundation arrived at the scene after the police announcement to pay her
respects with a large bouquet of flowers.

Ms
Brown said: 'The tide has turned. We're no longer in the '60s and '70s 
when people didn't discuss things like this. Victims are coming forward 
and there are more Moiras, believe you me, and we still have to try and 
find them.'

Police warned that the heavily 
waterlogged grave at Old Monkland Cemetery in Coatbridge has as many as 
three layers, and that establishing whether it contains Moira’s remains was likely to be a slow process.

They were exploring the possibility 
that Moira’s body may have been dumped under a coffin in the grave, 
which was thought to have been open around the time of her 
disappearance.

Allegations: Sandra Brown has compared her late father Alexander Gartshore to paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile

A large section of the 
cemetery was cordoned off with police tape, with a large black tent and a
series of smaller blue tents erected around the excavation site.

The exhumation was led by Professor Sue Black and a team from the forensic anthropology department at Dundee University.

Chief Inspector Kenny McLeod, of 
Strathclyde Police, said: ‘There may be no necessity to exhume all eight
human remains but that does remain a possibility.

'Operations like this 
are not taken lightly as we remain sensitive to Moira Anderson’s family 
and also the families who have relatives buried elsewhere in the 
cemetery.’
