A homeless charity has warned of a 'crisis' after figures revealed the number of new homes being built is at its lowest level since records began.

The number of new homes built in 2010/11 has dropped by 6% on the previous year, government figures have showed.

Just 121,200 new homes were built in England which means this year will see the fewest homes built since 1923.

Worrying decline: The number of new homes being built in England this year is at its lowest level since 1923

Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief 
executive, said: 'These figures will be a huge disappointment for 
millions of people up and down the country.

'Decades
 of failure to build enough homes hasn't just resulted in sky-high house
 prices, but is also responsible for an increasingly expensive rental 
market, with recent Shelter 
research revealing average private rents are now unaffordable for 
ordinary working families in over half of local authorities in England.

Work to do: Housing Minister Grant Shapps said the Government is taking 'radical action' to address England's housing need

'In
 this country every two minutes someone faces the nightmare of losing 
their home as more and more people struggle to keep up with their rent 
or mortgage.

'We are 
now at crisis point and the upcoming Government Housing Strategy must 
step forward with a long-term vision to build more homes to tackle our 
escalating housing crisis.'

This years figures represent a 6 per cent decrease on the 128,680 new homes built in the previous year, and compares with a steeper 23 per cent fall the year before that, the Department for Communities and Local Government said.

London saw the biggest decrease of new homes, with a 27 per cent fall on the previous year to reach 17,830 in the latest figures.

The North East saw the biggest supply increase at 26 per cent, reaching a figure of 4,710 more homes in 2010/11.

After tailing off slightly between 2000 and 2002, housing supply increased for six years in a row, peaking at 207,370 additional homes in 2007/08.

The overall fall in the latest figures was due to 6,500 fewer new-build completions, 1,180 fewer conversions, and 2,060 fewer extra dwellings resulting from changes of use.

The figures were offset by an increase of other types of accommodation, such as mobile homes and temporary dwellings, which rose by 840.

Fewer homes were also knocked down, with a fall in demolitions of 1,440 on the previous year.

John Stewart, Home Builders Federation director of economic affairs, said: 'The figures are very concerning at a time when we already have an acute housing shortage.

'Government needs to work with the industry and lenders to address lack of mortgage availability.

'It must also end the ongoing vacuum in planning policy and implement a planning system that delivers enough land to build the homes the country desperately needs.'

The annual report shows the supply of housing in England by measuring the absolute change in dwelling stock, including the number of completed new house builds and gains or losses through conversions and changes of use, minus demolitions.

The latest new homes figure includes 117,700 new-build homes, 5,050 additional homes resulting from conversions, 11,540 extra homes resulting from a change of use, as well as 1,810 other gains and a loss of 14,890 homes through demolitions.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said: 'Today's figures clearly show that we are still living with the legacy of a draconian system of top-down targets that pitted communities against developers.

'We're already taking radical action to turn the tide, and will shortly publish a Housing Strategy outlining both the measures we're already taking and some new moves we'll make to get Britain building again.

'These include scrapping targets and instead ensuring that, for the first time, local people see the benefits of growth in their area through the New Homes Bonus, which matches the council tax raised on new properties for six years.

'It also includes our Affordable Homes programme, which is set to exceed original expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes, on top of the 100,000 we want to help get built by making public land available to developers.'

The construction sector enjoyed a surprise expansion in October but economists today warned of more challenges ahead as confidence hit a three-year low.

The growth was driven by a surge in new orders from businesses, with civil engineering broadly stagnant and housebuilding in decline for the fifth month in a row.

But confidence dropped to its lowest level since December 2008 - when the UK was in the depths of the recession - amid Government cutbacks and uncertainties about the strength of private sector demand.

A closely watched Markit/CIPS survey,
 in which a reading above 50 represents expansion, hit a five-month high
 of 53.9, up from 50.1 in September.

Economists had expected it to flatline at around 50, which marks no growth.

The figures, although improved, will not significantly allay fears that the UK economy will contract in the final quarter of 2011, after woeful manufacturing figures released yesterday.

CIPS chief executive David Noble said the survey indicated that the sector had accelerated 'at some pace after a broad stagnation in September' but was 'nothing to get excited about'.

He added: 'Due to current economic conditions, it may be some time yet before we start seeing the sustained growth the sector really needs.

'Across the sector as a whole, confidence about future business activity plunged to its lowest in almost three years, with optimism fading as constructors come to recognise that there are more challenges yet to come.'

Official figures released yesterday revealed the UK's GDP increased by a better-than-expected 0.5% between July and September, up from the 0.1% rise in the previous quarter.

But these were overshadowed by a Markit/CIPS survey that showed the manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest rate since mid-2009 in October.

Today's survey showed the construction sector continued to recruit more staff in October, although at a slower rate than before.

Inflation on goods rose markedly in October, having hit a 10-month low in September. It was driven upwards by the rising cost of fuel and raw materials.

Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the sector is 'far from racing ahead and it clearly faces an extremely challenging environment' as the Government cuts spending on schools, hospitals and infrastructure.

He added that housebuilding activity will continue to be constrained amid soft prices and 'a worrisome outlook'.

He said: 'While the pick-up in activity in October is to be welcomed, it does not hugely dilute fears that the economy could contract in the fourth quarter.'

Worries over the state of the UK's economy will be heightened tomorrow if a survey for the powerhouse services sector, which accounts for three-quarters of the economy, shows a weaker performance.
