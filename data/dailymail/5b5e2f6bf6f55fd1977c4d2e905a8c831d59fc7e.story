The tech executive who was brutally beaten by a furious bikers in front of his wife and daughter was attacked by a gang six men who stomped on his head and body as he tried to crawl away, it has been revealed.

The NYPD have arrested two men and are seeking the identity of a third in connection with the broad daylight, but new cell phone video reveals there are even more suspects from last Sunday's incident in Manhattan.

Robert Sims, 35, who turned himself in on Friday, is accused of being one of them men who stomped Alexian Lien after mobbing his black Range Rover.

Also charged is Reginald Chance, 38, who is allegedly the biker seen bashing out Lien's car window with his helmet in a viral video filmed by a fellow rider.

The New York Post reports
 that police are looking for up to six suspects in Lien's assault. The 
six-on-one beating left Lien hospitalized and terrified his young 
daughter and wife, who were in the SUV.

An NYPD spokesman declined to comment Saturday evening as the unidentified person of interest's involvement in the attack.

Both Mr Chance and Mr Sims have been charged 
with attempted assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a 
weapon, according to the New York Post.

Mr Sims was seen on video stomping on the defenseless father's head, as well as punching and kicking him, prosecutors say. Mr Lien suffered two black eyes, as well as cuts on his face requiring stitches, according to a criminal complaint.

'The defendant is clearly seen stomping on [Lien’s] head,' assistant district attorney Joshua Steinglass told Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Diana Boyar during Saturday arraignment. A staggering $100,000 cash bail was set.

Both men have lengthy criminal records, with Mr Chance's rap sheet showing 21 arrests for a litany of crimes including felony drug, robbery and weapons charges. Mr Sims' criminal past includes car theft, drug and weapons possession charges - including for a samurai sword.

Meanwhile, NYPD spokesman John McCarthy confirmed Saturday that the unnamed detective believed to be an off-duty narcotics officer and member of a biker club was stripped of his gun and badge pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation why it took the agent four days to come forward.

He was riding with the Frontline Soldiers biker club, according to the New York Post. The papers aid the club also counts several others among its members.

Mr McCarthy said internal affairs was also trying to determine investigating whether any other officers were present during the Sunday altercation and didn't immediately report it.

It has been reported this week that at
 least five off-duty cops witnessed the beating of Mr Lien, who was driving an SUV on the Henry Hudson Parkway last Sunday 
with his family inside.

The incident left Lien needing stitches and motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr possibly paralyzed.

Among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack.
 One of the detectives, the undercover narcotics agent, watched as the
 violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his
 cover.

Undercover officers are required to immediately report being a witness to a crime. Uniformed officers are required to take police action if they see a crime occurring, but the rules are murkier for undercover officers who face blowing their cover, confusing civilians who don't realize the undercover is really a cop and compromising years-long investigations.

Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again

The five officers were not the only ones present, WABC
 is reporting that the NYPD is investigating whether several off-duty 
corrections officers were also there. Police who saw the violent attack 
did not begin coming forward until Wednesday - four days later.

Investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the YouTube video of the assault, according to WABC. They plan to talk to as many as possible, the station noted.

'This is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved,' a source told WABC.

One of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that Mr Lien 'drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side,' adding 'when he bumped that bike on the side, that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger,' according to WABC.

The New York Post originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene, as several members of the motorcycle group- called the Front Line Soldiers- are police officers themselves.

When reached Friday by MailOnline for comment, an NYPD spokesperson said only that the involvement of off-duty officers 'is under investigation.'

'It is does not appear that he got involved at the scene,' a police source told The Post, which added that the undercover officer has hired a lawyer.

He was not the only one to do so, as longtime partner of Edwin Mieses Jr, the man who was run over by the car, has hired famed defender Gloria Allred.

'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia said at a Friday press conference.

'To learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again- that is all still sinking in.

'It tears me up that anyone could think that Edwin in anyway deserves what happened to him.'

Mr Mieses was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black Range Rover on Manhattan's West Side Highway last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped, police said.

Video captured at the scene shows the SUV surrounded by helmeted riders.

In the video, one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver's side window.

Police said others tried to damage the SUV before the driver, Mr Lien, took off and plowed over Mieses.

The
 bikers then chased after Mr Lien and smashed his car window with their 
helmets, then pulled him from the SUV and beat him to the point where he
 required stitches.

Rosalyn Ng, Mr Lien's wife, said in a prepared statement that
 her family's sympathies go out to Mr Mieses, but that they had to flee a 
dangerous situation.

'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia, Mieses' longtime partner, said at a Friday press conference

Support: Ms Mejia, seen with attorney Gloria Allred and Mieses' father Edwin Mieses Sr, said that they are still coping with how to deal with Edwin's injuries

Mr Ng said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2-year-old child, who was also in the car at the time.

Mr Mieses, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered a broken spine, fractured
 ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve, according to Ms
Allred, who said during a press conference that his injuries may have left him paralyzed.

Pain: Ms Mejia said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner

'He told everyone to move on and go back to riding, and turned his back to the SUV to start walking back to his own bike,' Allred said.

'It was then, with his back to the SUV, and as he was in front of it, that he was run over and crushed,' the attorney added.

A difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a 'perception' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on Sunday, said Ms Mejia

'They are not gang members. They are not thugs,' Mr Mejia said.

'They are FedEx drivers, plumbers, military reservists, musicians. They are fathers and brothers and sons, and sisters and mothers.'

She also said Mr Mieses, the father of her children, didn't know any of the people he was riding with on Sunday aside from one friend who traveled to New York with him.

The potentially paralyzed biker was recently arrested in Andover, Mass., for driving with a revoked license. He also never applied for a motorcycle license.

Records show that in June Mr Mieses was named a habitual offender and his right to drive in the state was revoked until 2017. It wasn't clear if he had been licensed in any other state.

The large contingent seen on the video were participating in a periodic rally in which more than 1,000 bikers head for Times Square, police said.

The Manhattan district attorney's office has charged one rider, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, of Passaic, N.J., with unlawful imprisonment and reckless driving while authorities continue to search for other cyclists.

Investigators and prosecutors are tracking down and talking to dozens of helmet-clad motorcyclists seen in the video, which was posted online.
