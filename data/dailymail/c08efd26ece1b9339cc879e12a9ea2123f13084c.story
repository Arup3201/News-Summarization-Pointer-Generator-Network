A  hedge fund boss is facing a legal bill of up to £19million - thought to be one of the largest of its kind - after losing a fierce High Court battle against his former wife.

Dr Martin Coward has been landed with the bill after the latest in a string of disputes with 55-year-old fellow tycoon Elena Ambrosiadou, with whom he founded the Ikos investment firm.

The 56-year-old Cambridge mathematics graduate had insisted software which was the 'bedrock' of the company, which at its height handled funds worth a reported £2.3billion, belonged to him.

But in May last year London's High Court ruled the software belonged to Ikos, which is now controlled by his wife after they split.

He was ordered to pay huge legal bills in the case, which were made up of £13million racked up by Ikos for his wife's side and another £6million incurred by Dr Coward personally, the court heard.

Having launched divorce proceedings in Greece, then Monaco, then refiled in Greece and in London, Ms Ambrosiadou was described by friends of her former husband as having employed 'an army' of PR and legal experts to endure their acrimonious divorce and court battles. 

Though a judge has ruled Mr Coward must settle the £19million bill for a recent dispute over software which, it was ruled, belongs to her company, if she cannot sufficiently explain why her legal costs were so much higher, the bill could be reduced.  

He appealed against the costs order but lost yesterday, despite Court of Appeal judges saying it was one of the largest they had ever seen.

In a written ruling Mr Justice David Richards, sitting with Lord Justice Moore-Bick and Lord Justice Ryder, said the huge bills 'dwarf the great majority of civil claims, including most claims in the High Court.' 

The case was so complicated that it needed a three-week civil trial before a High Court judge.

Mr Justice Richards said Dr Coward was liable for the costs in his ruling, but did not specify the exact amount to be paid. He added: 'The costs seem very large'.

Although it currently stands at £19million, the bill could be reduced at a later hearing if Ikos cannot sufficiently explain why its lawyers cost more than double Mr Coward's.

The judge said the onus was on the firm 'to establish that its costs were both reasonable and proportionate'. 

Solicitor Liz Francis, a senior partner at Hanne & Co who has dealt with similar disputes over large family firms, told MailOnline: '£19million is a huge sum and I've never heard of costs that high in a case like this.

'Their lawyers could easily be charging £500 an hour and they can put in hundreds of hours of work with assistants, experts and QCs. It all mounts up.

1970s: Martin Coward and Elena Ambrosiadou met while both were studying at Cambridge in the.

1980s: After completing a PhD in Mathematics, British Coward was began work at Goldman Sachs in New York as a foreign exchange strategist.

Ambrosiadou, meanwhile, who had obtained an MBA herself, became an executive for BP at the age of 27. 

1992: The couple launch Ikos, which means home in Greek, as one of the first hedge funds set up in London. Ambrosiadou was just 32. 

1993: The couple marry in Greece. 

2004: Ambrosiadou is named the best paid woman in Britain after taking home a pay check of £15.9million.

2009: Coward resigns from Ikos with Ambrosiadou launching divorce proceedings within months in her native Greece. 

A sleuth of legal battles ensued, with as many as 48 reported at one time. 

The couple accused one another of spying on the other to get ahead in court. 

2013: After an acrimonious divorce, Ambrosiadou is allowed to keep Ikos software. A High Court judge rules Coward must pay £1,000 in damages.

2014: Coward is ordered to settle the £19million bill for years of bitter battling in court.

'I think it's very sad because cases like these consume people. You have to do a cost versus benefits analysis - if you go to court and go for the jugular, you might win but you have to consider what it will cost'. 

The  couple met at Cambridge University in the 1970s when Ms Ambrosiadou was studying chemical engineering and Dr Coward was obtaining a doctorate in mathematics.

They married in 1993, a year after they set up Ikos together  as a family business in London. 

In 2004, Ms Ambrosiadou was reported as Britain's highest-paid woman after giving herself £15.9million. 

The same year, she moved Ikos to Cyprus - a known tax haven.  

Mr Justice Richards said the marriage and business relationship between them then broke up 'acrimoniously' in 2009, sparking a string of court fights.

The couple now have legal disputes in Britain, Cyprus and Monaco. 

Ms Ambrosiadou is the chief executive of Ikos, while her estranged husband has set up his own hedge fund called Dormouse.

During the bitter three week trial last year, Mrs Justice Asplin said the evidence from both parties 'was tainted by their obvious and deep animosity, and the extremely close correlation between their business and their personal affairs.'

She said they were both 'highly intelligent and astute individuals,' but neither were satisfactory witnesses. 

But taking all the evidence into account she found it was 'all the more likely that the essential bedrock of the business, the software,' would be owned by the company.
