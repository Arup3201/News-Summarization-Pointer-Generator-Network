Worsening summer heatwaves and downpours in Europe and the U.S. could be linked to a thaw in Arctic ice.

A report published in ‘Nature Climate Change’ warned of increasingly extreme weather across ‘much of North America and Eurasia where billions of people will be affected’.

The study, which was dismissed as inconclusive by some experts, has intensified debate about whether human-induced global warming is responsible for climate change.

Experts in China and the United States said they could not conclusively say the Arctic thaw caused more extreme weather, or vice versa.

However, they said they had found evidence of a relationship between the two.

Rising temperatures over thawing snow on land and sea ice in the Arctic were changing atmospheric pressure and winds, the report said.

They claim the changes slowed the eastward movement of vast meandering weather systems and meant more time for extreme weather to develop.

The report claims changes in the North Pole could increase erratic weather patterns. The UK has seen extreme weather over the past 30 years. Here, the flooded River Derwent breaks its banks and floods properties in the town of Cumbria

These included a heatwave in Russia in 2010, droughts in the United States and China in 2011 and 2012, or heavy summer rains that caused floods in Britain in 2012.

The UK has seen extreme weather over the past 30 years, including the Great Storm of 1987, which claimed 22 lives, devastating floods at Boscastle in 2004 and Cockermouth in 2009 and October's storms, which killed four.

The report follows a warning by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that extreme weather will continue to become more frequent.

‘The study contributes to a growing body of evidence that ... the melting Arctic has wide-ranging implications for people living in the middle latitudes,’ lead author Qiuhong Tang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Reuters.

Sea ice in the Arctic shrank to a record low in 2012 and the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists says it could almost vanish in summers by 2050 with rising greenhouse gas emissions.

But some scientists said other factors, including the usual vagaries of weather or changing sea temperatures, may explain some recent extremes rather than changes in the Arctic.

‘The jury is still very much out,’ James Screen, an expert at Exeter University, said of efforts to see if there is a link between a melting Arctic and extremes further south in the northern hemisphere.

Some evidence in Sunday's study was ‘plausible ... but far from conclusive,’ he said, adding that some of the data were not statistically significant and might be random variations.

‘For people on the streets, what really matters is whether the extremes are changing or not. But from the scientific perspective we want to understand why,’ he said.  Better understanding is vital to make reliable predictions.

In September, the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists raised the probability that most global warming since 1950 has a human cause - mostly gases released by burning fossil fuels - to 95 per cent from 90 in a previous assessment in 2007.

James Overland, of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said many extremes studied were in the past decade, too short to know for sure if they were enhanced by Arctic ice and snow melt or not.

‘Sceptics remain unconvinced that Arctic/mid-latitude linkages are proven, and this work will do little to change their viewpoint,’ he wrote in a comment in Nature Climate Change.

The costs of extreme weather events have risen dramatically, climate scientists warned last week.

The national science academies of EU Member States believe Europe needs to plan for future probabilities of extreme weather, such as heat waves, floods and storms.

Highlighting a 60 per cent rise over the last 30 years in the cost of damage from extreme weather events across Europe, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) warned of the grave economic and social consequences if European policy makers do not use the latest estimates of future droughts, floods and storms in their planning while adapting to global warming and the resulting climate disruption.

The report urges EU nations to prepare for heat waves and think about how to reduce the number of deaths. Flood defence is also an area that requires improvement, as rising sea levels will leave coastal areas at serious risk from storm surges.

Researchers also believe climate research and adaptation plans should be given more priority.
