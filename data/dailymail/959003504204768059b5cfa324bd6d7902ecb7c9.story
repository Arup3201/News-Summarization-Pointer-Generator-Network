MILLIONS of self-employed workers risk poverty in retirement because only one in five now has a personal pension.

The ‘timebomb’ was revealed in official figures showing that even though their ranks have swelled by 700,000 during the economic crisis, the number of self-employed with a pension has plummeted.

The Office for National Statistics says 22 per cent of self-employed men had a personal pension last year compared with 37 per cent in 2006. 

The number of self-employed people who are saving for their retirement has plummeted according to new figures  

The data did not include women, who are even less likely than men to have a personal pension.

Research by insurance firm Prudential found that because of low wage growth more than half said they could not afford contributions. 

‘This is a very risky approach which could leave them facing a significant drop in their standard of living as they enter retirement,’ it said.

Research showed that because of a low wage growth, more than half of people said they could not afford contributions  

However, the ONS found a marked rise in the number of employees in workplace pensions. Almost half are now members of a scheme, with take-up boosted by the Government’s new auto-enrolment scheme.

Pensions guru Ros Altmann said: ‘The big attraction of workplace pension is that you get an employer contribution. Therefore, the attraction of pensions for self-employed is far lower.’

Tom McPhail, pensions expert at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the demands of running their own business meant it was ‘hardly surprising that the self-employed haven’t seen pensions as a high priority
