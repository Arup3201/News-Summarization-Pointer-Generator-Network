St. Louis' Gateway Arch was allegedly a bombing target of two men, who are also accused of having an alleged murder plot meant for two  officials, it was reported Wednesday.

The alleged schemes and targets, namely Ferguson's Chief of Police Tom Jackson and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, were revealed by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Ali Davis allegedly purchased a fake pipe bomb during a sting operation - and had hoped they could purchase another two bombs though the pair lacked  sufficient funds, sources told the newspaper.

Indicted: Olajuwon Davis, pictured, is one of the men who allegedly had a plot to bomb the Gateway Arch. Sources have said that Davis was in charge of the plan 

The newspaper reported that its sources expressed skepticism that the alleged plots could have been achieved by Baldwin and Davis.

Davis was allegedly in charge  and more charges stemming from the scheme may come soon, the sources told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Baldwin and Davis were indicted on gun charges last week, and the alleged murder and bomb plots are not included in their indictment, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted. 

The newspaper obtained and published a copy of the indictment, which has been unsealed. 

Sometime from November 1 to November 13 Baldwin had said he was purchasing two guns for himself at a Hazelwood gun store, though they were being purchased for someone else, the document said. 

The Gateway Arch was supposed to have a bomb placed in its observation deck, sources told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Baldwin and Davis have been charged with 'aiding and abetting the making of a false written statement in connection with a firearms purchase,' the newspaper reported.

The media outlet also reported that search warrants for two buildings were served.

Davis and Baldwin appeared in court on Tuesday and entered not guilty pleas - and 'waived their right to make a case for bail, so the hearing did not proceed,' according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The newspaper noted that the New Black Panthers dismissed the allegations against Davis and Baldwin in a statement.

The two men were the subjects of a months-long investigation, sources told television station KDSK. 

Brandon Orlando Baldwin, seen here, was also allegedly involved in the plot
