Rotherham Council spent £2million on a ‘personal vanity project’ to bring Dolly Parton to the town – at the same time as child sex grooming by mainly Pakistani men was being ignored.

Roger Stone, its council leader at the time, is a lifelong fan of the country singer and persuaded her to set up a children’s reading project.

She visited the town amid great fanfare in 2007 to launch the scheme, which now looks likely to close. The project aimed to attract support from businesses to pay for every child under five to receive a book every month but the council struggled to find sponsors.

Mr Stone, who resigned in August after a report heavily criticised the authority for the grooming scandal, had persuaded Miss Parton to be the Imagination Library scheme’s patron.

Don Buxton, a campaigner in the town who obtained details of the scheme through the Freedom of Information Act, said: ‘The Imagination Library is another one of those damaging, expensive, failed personal political vanity projects of the Roger Stone era.’ 

Emma Hoddinott, deputy leader of the Labour-dominated council, which is now to be run by government appointed commissioners after being branded unfit for purpose, said the future of the scheme is under review.

Mr Stone is to be questioned next month by a Select Committee over failures by the council after more than 1,400 children were abused by gangs of mainly Pakistani men.

He was described as a ‘sexist bully’ in a later report into its handling of the scandal. In 2007, hundreds of businessmen and civic leaders were invited to the launch of the Imagination Library at Rotherham’s Magna science and technology centre.

The launch, including a slap-up lunch, was rumoured to have cost more than £10,000, and Miss Parton, 69, played guitar and sang a handful of her hits, including Jolene.

She spoke to the visitors about her poor upbringing and her resulting passion for reading. 

Worth an estimated £110million, Parton chose Rotherham to launch the scheme in Europe after being impressed that it had introduced a similar method locally.
