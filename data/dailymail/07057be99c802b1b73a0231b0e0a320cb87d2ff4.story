Sophie Wessex cut an elegant figure in a pretty powder pink coat as she joined the rest of the royal family at Sandringham today.

The Countess of Wessex, who celebrates her 50th birthday this year, has been lauded for her increasingly chic dress sense in recent months - as well as for her devotion to charity work.

With her was her daughter Lady Louise Windsor, 11, who was well wrapped up against the chill in a bright green scarf.

Along with Prince Edward, the family has spent the last five days at Sandringham where they celebrated Christmas with the Queen - who has long been close to Sophie.

The monarch, 88, was also at the service, although unlike the rest of the family, she chose to be driven to the church of St Mary Magdalene on the edge of the 20,000 acre estate.

Resplendent in a gold and cream tweed coat and a matching hat, the Queen appeared to be in good spirits as she arrived, beaming broadly at the crowd of 1,000 well-wishers who had gathered to see her.

The Duke of Edinburgh, who walked to the church with Princess Anne, also stopped to say hello as did a cheerful Prince Charles who arrived with his nephew Peter Phillips and his niece-in-law Autumn Kelly.

Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose to stay away, however, with William and Kate thought to have remained at their Norfolk home Anmer Hall with the Middletons.

Other absentees included Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, the Duke of York and the Duchess of Cornwall, who also missed the Christmas day service.

During the service, prayers were said for the suspected victims of the missing AirAsia flight, as well as for the victims of conflicts in Syria and Iraq and the families of those who lost loved ones in the Boxing Day tsunami a decade ago.

Afterwards, the Queen  left children in the crowd disappointed by leaving church without stopping to collect flowers from them.

But several bouquets were collected on her behalf by Prince Charles and Sophie Wessex as they walked back to Sandringham House.

Charles also stopped to speak to some members of the crowd, greeting Nicky Bantoft, 36, by saying: 'Good morning, you must be cold'.

Mrs Bantoft of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, who was outside the church with her children Hannah, ten and Jack, eight, said: 'We replied, "Yes, we have been wiggling our toes to keep warm".'

Michelle Sparrow, 42, of Helensville, Auckland, New Zealand, and her children Jack, 12, and Isabel, ten, attracted the attention of Prince Philip who spotted their New Zealand and All Blacks flags.

Mrs Sparrow who is staying with her husband's family in Mildenhall, Suffolk, said: 'He said, "Have you come a long way?" Then he saw our flags and asked if we were from New Zealand.

'When we told him that we were over here on holiday, he said: "I hope it's worth it". Edward also spoke to us and asked if we were finding it cold.'

Cold or not, Charles in particular had reason to be cheerful after it was revealed that the running of the Sandringham Estate has been turned over to him by the Duke of Edinburgh.

The job includes overseeing the Estate's arable, livestock and fruit farms, property and a 240-acre country park.

Prince Philip, 93, is currently responsible for several estates, including Balmoral, Windsor and, until recently, Sandringham.

Local sources say Prince Philip started to pass control of Sandringham’s 20,000 acres to Charles this year.

The Duke will continue to be consulted over changes, but Charles will have a more hands-on role. 

‘We understand Prince Philip has handed the management over to his son,’ a source told the Mail on Sunday.

‘Charles is now taking a very close interest in the estate and its running. He has excellent ideas and we are expecting to see different things happening.’

Estate workers say they expect to see more of the prince in the coming months as he implements changes, such as more organic farming.

Sandringham has been a private home for British monarchs since 1862. As well as being the Queen’s country retreat, it is a successful commercial estate. 

The property will join a number of others under Charles' management, among them his 900 acre Highgrove Estate in Gloucestershire, and Birkhall, his Scottish home on the Balmoral Estate.
