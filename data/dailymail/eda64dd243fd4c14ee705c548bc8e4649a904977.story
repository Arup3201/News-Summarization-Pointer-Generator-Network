With their craggy features, big beards and wild hair they are perhaps an unlikely bunch of film stars.

But this band of weather-beaten, white-whiskered fishermen, have bagged roles alongside Hollywood A-listers such as Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron.

The men from Weymouth, Dorset, have found success on the big screen after being spotted and signed up with a casting agency, after first being mistaken for actors.

Their authentic appearances mean they are regularly snapped as extras by film producers wanting to make nautical scenes more realistic.

The fishermen have so far starred in Tim Burton’s 2012 gothic comedy Dark Shadows starring Depp as a 2,000-year-old vampire fisherman.

They also brought their rustic charm to the 2012 fantasy Snow White and the Huntsman which featured Theron alongside Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth.

One of them, 75-year-old Ivor Charles, appeared as Captain Smith of the Titanic for a documentary film about the sinking of the ill-fated liner.

Their most recent casting call was to Pinewood Studios to film the remake of Cinderella alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett and Stellen Skarsgard.

Mr Charles stumbled into the unlikely pastime when a production worker on Richard Curtis’s The Boat That Rocked spotted him while filming near Weymouth in 2008.

Following his success, he then roped his friends including Kelvin Moore, Kevin Nurrish, Kevin Hart and Dave Parrott into joining him on set.

Mr Charles: 'I was wandering down to my boat one day to go fishing and it happened to be when the filming for The Boat That Rocked was taking place on Portland.

'I was having a cigarette with a friend when a man with a clipboard came over and asked if I was part of the production.

'I told him that I wasn’t, and that I was just off to my boat like normal.

'He said that he wanted me to be part of the film as a fisherman so I thought "why not?"

'The next thing I knew, I was taking part in the final scene of the film where the main characters get rescued from their sinking ship.'

Mr Charles and his fisherman friends signed up to Mad Dog Casting and watched as the bookings flooded in.

Despite being most often cast as fishermen, Mr Charles’s crowning glory was playing Capt Smith for National Geo-graphic’s 2012 documentary film RMS Titanic: Case Closed.

He added: 'I would never have thought that I would end up on film sets in my 70s but I really enjoy it.

'All
the lads down the pub tease me and call me "film star" but I don’t 
think there’s any chance of seeing me in a leading role any time soon.

'That said, I would love to be the next Captain Birdseye - just a leaner, meaner, more healthy looking version.'

Mr Moore, 48, who has been fishing from Weymouth for more than 30 years, added: 'Working on a shoot is a welcome break from fishing and a good laugh.

'We get very well looked after - it’s like a little holiday with all your mates.

'When we filmed Dark Shadows we unloaded a tonne of crab at three in the morning, nipped home for a shower and we were on set at Pinewood Studios by midday.

'There’s a very set idea of what fishermen should look like so we get told to grow our beards and let our hair get wild.

'We also advise them on how to make the scenes more realistic.'

The highlight for fisherman Kevin Hart, 55, was acting alongside Hammer Horror legend Christopher Lee.

He said: 'I grew up watching Christopher Lee and just to be on the same set as him was awe inspiring.

'Our sideline in films is a little out of the ordinary and it’s great fun.'

While working on Dark Shadows the men even got to share a pint with legendary film producer Richard Zanuck, responsible for hits such as Jaws, Driving Miss Daisy and Sweeney Todd.

George Moss, film project manager at Mad Dog Casting, said: 'The Weymouth boys are great additions to any shoot.

'They’re hard working and reliable and they have a great look as well as the knowledge that comes with being fishermen all their lives.'
