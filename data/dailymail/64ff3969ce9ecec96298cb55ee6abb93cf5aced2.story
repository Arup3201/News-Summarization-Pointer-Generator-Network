The federal government has launched a $1 million media campaign urging Central American parents not to send their children to the U.S. as illegal immigrants in a bid to combat the recent surge in unaccompanied children attempting to enter the country.

The message aimed primarily at Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador is two-part: The trip to the United States is extremely dangerous, and immigrants who make it here will not be allowed to stay.

‘We have to stem the flow,’ said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, who launched the campaign on Wednesday while standing beside the Rio Grande.

Kerlikowske said that 226 immigrants have died crossing the border since October.

More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained during the same period after entering the U.S. illegally, mostly in South Texas.

The so-called Dangers Awareness Campaign will employ hundreds of billboards and some 6,500 public service announcements for radio and television stations in the target countries.

One offering has an image of a child's footprints in the desert running toward the horizon with the message in Spanish: ‘I thought it would be easy for my son to get papers in the USA. ... I was wrong.’

The television and radio spots all finish with a similar parting message: 'They are our future. Protect them'

A television spot slated to air in Guatemala shows a teenage boy preparing to leave home for the U.S.

His mother pleads with him not to go. He confides to his uncle - already in the U.S. - in a letter that she's warning him about the dangers of the gangs on the train that immigrants ride through Mexico, the cartels that kidnap and the dayslong walk in the desert.

Ultimately, he writes his uncle, ‘he who doesn't take a chance, doesn't win.’

The next image is of the boy dead on the cracked desert floor. A voiceover says smugglers' claims that new arrivals will easily get papers are false.

‘We want a relative that is about to send $5,000, $6,000 to a relative in El Salvador to see this message and say, “Oh my god, they're saying that the journey is more dangerous,'" said CBP spokesman Jaime Ruiz. ‘We try to counter the version of the smuggler.’

Ruiz said the campaign is scheduled to run for 11 weeks. He will be traveling to cities with large immigrant communities in the U.S. as well to reach the parents or relatives on this side of the border who may help fund a child's trip.

The effort will test high production value messaging against the pervasive gang violence and intense poverty that pushes many immigrants to flee their homelands.

‘Families need to understand that the journey north has become much more treacherous and there are no “permisos” for those crossing the border illegally,’ said Kerlikowske. 

‘Children, especially, are easy prey for coyotes and transnational criminal organizations and they can be subjected to robbery, violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking or forced labor.’

This week South Texas officials reported that the body of a Guatemalan boy, Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez, 15, was found in the brush about a mile from the Rio Grande.

He was trying to reach his brother in Chicago to help support their family in rural Guatemala.
