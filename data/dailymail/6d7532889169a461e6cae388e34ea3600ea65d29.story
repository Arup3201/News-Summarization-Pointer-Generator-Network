Italy launched a massive rescue last night of more than 2,000 stricken migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya, where fears are growing over the rise of Islamic extremists.

Coastguard officials reportedly recovered 2,164 people who had been crammed onto a dozen boats in the latest in a string of increasingly desperate attempts to enter Europe.

It came on the same day Italy said it was evacuating 100 embassy staff in Libya, where extremists from the self-styled Islamic State group have beheaded 21 Coptic Christians in a gruesome video.

Emergency: Migrants were handed foil blankets and tended to by Red Cross officials on the choppy waters

By last night around 520 migrants were on board an Italian navy ship, the TGcom24 television station's website said.

More than 900 other migrants were picked up by coastguard and customs police boats, while the rest were rescued by various ships in the area, according to reports. 

The Italian transport ministry said some of its coastguards had been threatened by four armed men earlier in the day who approached them by speedboat from the Libyan coast. 

The Kalashnikov-wielding men forced the rescuers to return a boat that had been emptied of migrants, the ministry said in a statement. 

Last year more than 3,200 people died while attempting to reach Italy by boat from North Africa, a sea crossing described by the UN as the most dangerous in the world.

Survivors: Not all migrants who try to reach Italy are so lucky. Last year more than 3,000 died on the journey

On Friday, some 600 migrants on board six dinghies were rescued by the Italian coastguard and merchant vessels around 50 miles off the Libyan coast.

Many have now reached Sicily, where their fate will be decided by the Italian authorities.

But in a major tragedy last week, more than 300 migrants died in the Mediterranean Sea when their overcrowded rubber dinghies collapsed and sank in stormy weather. 

The victims were among migrants mainly from sub-Saharan Africa who had embarked on the perilous journey from a beach near Tripoli.

Today Italy's interior minister warned of an 'exodus without precedent' if the spread of Islamic State, also known as Isis, was allowed to continue unchecked.

Militants have already rampaged through Iraq and Syria and seized large parts of the country, vowing to establish a Caliphate throughout the Middle East following an extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam.

Islamic State's victims have included Christians and Yazidis alongside thousands of Muslims - who are told to follow the militants' version of religion or die like everyone else.

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: 'We must not lose a minute.

'You have to intervene in Libya with a UN mission. The international community must understand that it is crucial for the future of the West.

'The threats against our country, unfortunately, are not new and our warning was already very high.'

He insisted journalists 'could not create a link' between growing uncertainty in Libya and the wave of migrants willing to risk death to enter the country.

But he added: 'The militias of the Caliph [are] advancing faster than the decisions of the international community.

Worrying: The United Nations has described the sea crossing as the most dangerous in the world

'We risk an exodus without precedent and difficult to control.'  

Italian Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti told the newspaper Il Messaggero that the risk of jihadists arriving in Italy on boats carrying immigrants from Libya 'could not be ruled out'.

She said Italy was ready to lead a coalition from Europe and north African states to battle against the advance of jihadists in Libya.

'The risk is imminent, we cannot wait any longer,' she said. 'Italy has national defence needs and cannot have a caliphate ruling across the shores from us.'

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told public television on Saturday that Rome was committed to intervening in Libya, and called for a stronger United Nations mission.

'We have told Europe and the international community that we have to stop sleeping,' he said.

Perilous: Migrants are often crammed into unstable dinghies which are unable to survive the trip 

Last week's deaths of hundreds of migrants underscored the limited means and scope of Triton, an EU-run mission which took over in November from the Italian navy in scanning the sea for migrants.

Italy scaled back the mission after its EU partners refused to share running costs of around 9million euros a month.

Since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011, Libya - a former Italian colony - has been plagued by conflict among rival forces battling for control of key cities and the country's oil riches.

Islamist militants, who released their brutal beheading video of a group of Coptic Christians yesterday, have left the situation even more fractured.
