While most people like to blame fast food restaurants like McDonald's for any extra pounds they might be carrying, one overweight man found working for the company actually helped him slim down.

Colin Moore, 27, of Spennymoor in County Durham, was so worried when his weight hit 24st that he asked doctors for gastric bypass surgery.

He was told he would be put on a waiting list and, faced with a long delay, decided to begin a regular diet.

After losing 8st, he began working at McDonald’s where, ironically, being around fast food all day gave him the motivation he needed to reach his target weight.

He said: 'I was dangerously overweight and needed to do something about it. I thankfully lost the weight myself so didn’t need a gastric band.

'Working at McDonald’s put me off the burgers, helping me reach my final goal.'

Mr Moore was not overweight as a young boy but when he was ten years old he began getting bullied at school, which led to him hiding in his house and eating for comfort.

He said: 'I wouldn’t go out and play and instead stayed at home. So I got bigger, which meant I was bullied more.

Colin struggled with his weigh from a young age, being bullied at school because of his size which caused him to continue overeating, reaching over 20st (left) before losing nearly half his body weight (right)

'When I started secondary school the kids started called me The Penguin, like Danny DeVito from the Batman film.

'I suffered from depression and anxiety. As I grew up I wouldn’t go out, I didn’t work and I wouldn’t socialise.

'As I’ve grown up it’s always been in my mind. My weight loss has been for myself, but also to prove those bullies wrong.'

In 2012, when Mr Moore was 22st, his uncle died from a smoking-related illness.

He said: 'The shock urged me to stop smoking but within five months I had gained another two stone.'

Mr Moore ballooned to over 24st 7lb and went to doctors in May 2013, hoping to be referred for a gastric bypass.

He said: 
'I had lied to myself for a long time and refused to believe that I was 
so big. When I was weighed and knew it for certain I knew I had to do 
something drastically.

'I felt a gastric bypass was the only option. It was laziness though - I was taking the easy option.'

He was 
told by doctors that although he was eligible for the procedure, he 
would need to join a long waiting list. Motivated by a desire to turn 
his life around, Mr Moore began dieting.

Mr
 Moore said: 'I have never looked back since that day. I cut out all of 
the rubbish foods such as crisps, biscuits and fizzy pop.

'I got a beautiful dog called Buddy. He’s a springer spaniel who needs constant walking - so that keeps me moving.'

Breakfast: Nothing

Lunch: Two burgers and chips

Dinner: Whole meat feast pizza

Snacks: Crisps, sweets and 2litres coke

Breakfast: Fruit

Lunch: Ham sandwich and rice cakes

Dinner: Chicken and vegetables

Snacks: Has eliminated fizzy drinks

In his first month Mr Moore lost 18lb.

Between May and November 2013 he lost a further 8st and dropped from a 46- to a 38-inch waist.

Mr Moore said: 'It gave me confidence to go outside. I wasn’t working at the time and it gave me the confidence to go out and get the job at McDonald’s.'

Working surrounded by the smell of burgers overloaded Mr Moore’s senses and put him off fast food completely.

Mr Moore’s weight continued to drop off and he lost another two stone while working at the fast food restaurant.

Mr Moore, who still works at McDonald’s,
 said: 'It helped with the weight loss. Since I have worked there I 
haven’t eaten any burgers. You get a free employee meal as standard, but
 I choose not to eat it.

'I have nothing against McDonald’s but I like the way I am now and I know if I ate the burgers there’s no way I would stay at this weight.'

Before beginning his weight loss, he typically ate nothing for breakfast, then two burgers with chips for lunch. For dinner he would often eat whole meat feast pizzas to himself from his local takeaway, and would snack on beef crisps, sweets and a two litre bottle of full fat coke.

Today, he 
typically eats a piece of fruit for his breakfast. For lunch he will 
have a ham salad sandwich with rice cakes. For dinner he now goes for 
the healthy option of chicken with boiled vegetables or a healthy curry.
 He has also cut the fizzy drinks out of his diet.

Now
 only 14st 7lb, he has lost so much weight that he dropped a shoe size 
due to the loss of body fat. His waist has dropped to size 34.

People who
 Mr Moore has known for years now walk past him in the street as he is 
so unrecognisable in his new form, and he says that losing so much weight has given him a new lease on life.

He said: 'I’m more confident and outgoing, I actually want to be around people now.

'I enjoy going out and shopping because I can now find things which fit.'
