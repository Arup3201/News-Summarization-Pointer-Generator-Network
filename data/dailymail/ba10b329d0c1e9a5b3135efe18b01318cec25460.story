A Texas convenience store clerk who was kidnapped and beaten unconscious Tuesday passed away this afternoon after his family asked his doctors to have him taken off life support. 

Kevin Garcia, 55, was assaulted and kidnapped from Drew’s Exxon in College Station before dawn Tuesday.

Police were dispatched after a customer found the gas station convenience store empty.

Bumpy ride: A bleeding Garcia spent 10 hours being bounced around the back of his truck before he was rescued 200 miles away 

Hours later, Garcia was rescued by police in Fort Worth, 200 miles away from his store. The man was found unconscious and bloodied in the bed of his truck and rushed to John Peter Smith Hospital.

The suspect, Nathaniel Tillery, 36, was arrested nearby and later charged with robbery, kidnapping and assault.

Garcia's older sister, Denise Etherton, and her husband, Bill, had been by the victim’s side since Tuesday afternoon, praying for a miracle against overwhelming odds.

'He hasn’t been conscious since they found him,' Mrs Etherton said earlier Thursday. 'He’s completely out.'

According to Etherton, her baby brother, who was adopted by their parents at age nine, suffered severe head trauma after being deprived of oxygen for more than 10 hours.

Cornered: Tillery's stepbrother called 911 and led police to a location along the Tijuana Trail in suburban Fort Worth, where officers apprehended the alleged attacker 

Yesterday afternoon, the comatose patient's family met with his doctors to discuss his prospects.

Upon learning that Kevin Garcia will most likely never recover, Denise Etherton made the difficult decision to take her brother off the ventilator.

'Kevin would want quality of life,' she later said.

Officials at the hospital stated to Fort Worth Star-Telegram that Garcia was pronounced dead at 1.36pm.

His sister said her sibling was an organ donor, and she hopes in his death Kevin will be able to help others. 

The 55-year-old had worked at the Exxon station off Highway 6 in College Station for 15 years and was recently divorced.

His sister tearfully recalled that not long before his abduction, Garcia was doing some dental work to improve his appearance because, he told her, he was hoping to meet someone.

'He didn't want to be alone,' Denise Etherton told KBTX. 'He didn't want to die alone.'

At around 3am Tuesday, Garcia was cleaning the parking lot outside his store when police say Nathaniel Tillery attacked him.

After beating the store clerk unconscious, the 36-year-old suspect threw him into the bed of his truck and entered the gas station store hoping to steal money from the cash register, but he failed to open it.

Targeted: The deadly assault was the second time that Garcia has been attacked on the job in as many years

He then got behind the wheel of the truck, with a battered Garcia still in the back, and drove him 190 miles to suburban Fort Worth, where his family live.

At around 1pm Tuesday, Tillery's stepbrother called 911 and led police to a location along Tijuana Trail, where shortly after they located the truck and the alleged assailant, reportedCBS DFW.

Past offenses: Tillery has a lengthy criminal record dating back to the 1990s, including a conviction on an intoxicated assault charge

Denise Etherton believes that Kevin would have had a better chance of survival had Tillery left him in the parking lot in College Station instead of having him bouncing around the bed of the truck for 10 hours.

‘If he had been left on the ground, take the truck, he would have been found an hour later, instead of being found 11 or 12 hours later,’ the heartbroken sister told NBC DFW.

The deadly assault was the second time that Garcia has been attacked on the job in as many years.

In 2013, two robbers beat up the store clerk with brass knuckles, leaving him with head injuries. One of the assailants was later sentenced to 17 years in prison after entering a guilty plea, while the other is still awaiting trial.

Investigators believe Garcia and Tillery did not know one another. However, an employee at Drew's Exxon told police that Tillery, who has been seen around the area, once confided in him that a truck and $2,000 would 'make his life better.'

On Thursday, Tillery was transferred from Tarrant County to the Brazos County Jail, where he is being held on $520,000 bail.

The 36-year-old has a lengthy criminal record dating back to the 1990s, according to The Eagle, including a conviction on an intoxicated assault charge in 2001 that landed him behind bars for eight years.

Bill Etherton, Garcia's brother-in-law, had some harsh words about the suspected assailant in an interview with the local CBS affiliate. 

‘As far as I’m concerned, they can tie him to the back of the pickup truck and drag him back to Bryan. I don’t care,’ he stated.
