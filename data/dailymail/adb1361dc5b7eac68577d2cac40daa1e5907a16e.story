SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO...

X Factor finalist Rachel Crow, 13, made an emotional exit from the competition last night in scenes that made for uncomfortable viewing.

The 13-year-old was devastated after she was sent home from the competition after judge Nicole sent the vote to deadlock after she picked Rachel to leave over finalist Marcus Canty.

Once presenter Steve Jones announced she had received the lowest number of votes from the public, the youngster dramatically slumped to the ground and collapsed in a flood of tears upon realising her X Factor dream was over.

Her worried mother rushed onto the stage to comfort her screaming daughter who looked even younger than her 13 years.

And as she tried her best to reassure her that everything would be okay, in heartbreaking scenes Rachel wailed: 'Mommy you promise me?... Promise me?.'

Devastated: Young X Factor hopeful Rachel Crowe was at the centre of uncomfortable scenes last night as she sobbed uncontrollably at being dumped off show The X Factor USA

Overcome: The tenn slumped to the floor as she heard the news, wailing uncontrollably as presenter Steve Jones and finalist Marcus Canty - who survived - looked concerned

Stepping in: Simon Cowell made his way up onto the stage to scoop up his act up as presenter Jones dithered

The teenager's reaction appeared to paralyse presenter Jones, who looked flustered and failed to act.

As judge Nicole Scherzinger burst into tears, presenter Jones floundered 
around the heartbroken young singer.

It was left to head judge Simon 
Cowell to take charge, as he rushed onto the stage to pick the sobbing 
teen off the floor.

Former Pussycat Doll Nicole also arrived onstage still weeping, and stood awkwardly behind Rachel.

She could have saved the teen but instead threw the vote to a tie, meaning the final decision was left to the public vote.

The show's cameras appeared to hastily cut to Jones as an inconsolable Rachel was comforted by Cowell and her mother.

X Factor USA relaxed competition 
rules to allow younger performers to bid for stardom, while in the UK 
the age limit is still fixed at 16.

But even in the UK some industry insiders have voiced concerns that it is still too low. 

On the UK show popular contestant Luke Lucas, 16, was axed after a disastrous performance during the judges' houses round leading judge and Take That star Gary Barlow to declare 16 too young for the show.

The 16-year-old had wowed during the 
initial stages but buckled under the pressure in LA, disappointing Gary 
with an out of time and off-key performance of Shontelle's 
Impossible.

Luke broke down in tears and had to be comforted by a crew member, which
 led the UK X Factor's head judge to voice his concerns with
 the show's age limit.

Barlow said: 'Sixteen is just too 
young to be in a competition with this kind of pressure.'

As the cameras cut to the montage of her time on the show Nicole also appeared inconsolable and held her hands up to her face.

When Steve asked her if she had anything to say she simply turned away, adding to the emotional tension present on stage.

Nicole didn't want to pick between Rachel and Marcus Canty and turned to the other judges to seek their advice as she said: 'I can’t make this decision I’ve been up there and I know how that feels.'

But with Simon and LA Reid both opting to save their own acts and Paula choosing to save Rachel, Nicole was left with the final decision. 

Thanks for voting: Rachel managed to compose herself to say thank you to her fans and told them it wouldn't be the last they see of her

Call for peace: Rachel tweeted after the show for people not to be angry with Nicole

Foreboding: Cowell tweeted that he had a 'weird feeling' shortly before the show

After a drawn out pause she reluctantly chose to send Rachel home, thus putting the pair to deadlock, but it was revealed the teen had failed to attract as many votes as Marcus, and the exuberant little girl was clearly shattered by the news.

When she managed to compose herself Rachel fought back her emotions to say a few words.

Speaking through her tears she gushed: 'I just love you so much, everybody, for voting for me even though you didn't and thank you for giving me this because without you I am nothing.'

I hope this is not my ending, you know what I know it's not.

Lowest votes: Rachel was in the bottom two with Marcus Canty but the thrice-lucky singer received more public votes than the teenager

Simon, who only has one act left in the competition said: 'I want to thank everyone that's voted for this young girl. I believe she went out on the highest she could have gone out on. Like I said, from the very first time I met you, we're going to be hearing a lot more about Rachel Crow, I give you my word on that.'

Nicole also appeared to be devastated by the public decision and was seen with tears streaming down her face and Paula Abdul got up to wrap her arms around her in an attempt to offer comfort.

What have I done? Nicole looked distraught as she learned that Rachel would be going after she sent the decision to the public vote

While Josh Krajick and Chris Rene were told they were through to the semi final at the start of the show, Simon Cowell was put under pressure when Melanie Amaro had to wait with Rachel and Marcus to learn her fate.

She was put through and it was down to the energetic teenager and religious man Marcus to perform their save me songs.
