Sunderland have taken young Arsenal defender Semi Ajayi on trial.

The Nigerian, 21, has featured on the bench for the Gunners in the Premier League this season but is out of contract in the summer.

Ajayi lined up for the Black Cats Under 21 side in their goalless draw with Norwich on Monday night.

Picked up from Charlton after a successful trial in 2013, Ajayi followed a similar path to Carl Jenkinson in moving to north London.

As Arsenal struggled for injuries this season, the 6ft 3in player was an unused substitute in games against Hull City, Stoke and Newcastle, as well as in the Capital One Cup defeat by Southampton.

But with Arsene Wenger keen on bringing in a defender during this window and Ajayi's deal running out, Gus Poyet is casting an eye.
