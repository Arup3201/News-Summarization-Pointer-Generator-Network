They are one of the deadliest creatures in the water but you wouldn't expect them to turn on their own. 

A large alligator measuring an estimated 14ft was spotted ripping a smaller gator in half at the Circle B Bar Reserve in Lakeland, Florida.

The fearsome creature caught the alligator in the swamp and slammed it on to the surface of the water - at one stage flipping it vertically into the air.

Deadly: The 14ft alligator throws the smaller gator in the air before slamming it into the water

During the fierce fight the predator then managed to sever the 8ft gator in two.

Neil Furlong, a 51-year-old sheet metal worker from Florida said: ‘I heard a tremendous splash and what to me sounded like squeals.

‘I could see the head of the alligator but I could not see what it had in its mouth.’

The alligator disappeared into the water with its prize firmly between its jaws and Neil had to wait an agonising ten minutes for it to emerge again.

He added: ‘It began to raise and I went into continuous shooting mode. I still did not know at that point what he had in his mouth.

‘It was only until I stepped back and checked the images on the LCD screen that I saw it was another alligator.’

Neil believes the larger alligator attacked the other over territory - and it wasn’t a fair fight.

He added: ‘This whole thing has been an awesome experience to have happened to me, I feel blessed to have witnessed this and to have documented it with photos.

‘I was just in the right place and the right time.’
