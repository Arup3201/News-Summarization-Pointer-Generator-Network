Boris Johnson today launched a furious attack on a government adviser for rejecting his dream of a brand new four-runway airport in the Thames Estuary.

The London Mayor said the rebuttal of his Boris Island plan meant the debate about how to increase flights capacity in and out of Britain had been set back 'by half a century', and claimed the report would simply 'gather dust on a shelf in Whitehall'.

But he insisted the plan was not dead, as it emerged Sir Howard Davies's commission will now consider just three options - two additional runway plans at Heathrow and one at Gatwick.

London Mayor Boris Johnson today accused the Airports Commission of setting the aviation debate back by a decade

Mr Johnson said his Thames Estuary plan was no more dead than 'the Channel Tunnel was dead 100 years' ago when it was first rejected'

Boris Island would have seen a new four-runway hub airport built in the Thames estuary with high-speed rail links to London. 

The London mayor argued that, with expansion at Heathrow constrained, the idea was the only way to keep the UK competitive in terms of airport capacity.

But the independent Airports Commission, which was set up to tackle the need for increased airport capacity and is led by Sir Howard, is to urge ministers to focus instead on expansion at either Heathrow or Gatwick. 

Pre-empting the commission's official announcement, Mr Johnson issues a strongly-worded statement condemning Sir Howard's decision to turn his back on Boris Island.

Mr Johnson said: 'In one myopic stroke the Airports Commission has set the debate back by half a century and consigned their work to the long list of vertically filed reports on aviation expansion that are gathering dust on a shelf in Whitehall.'

He insisted the Thames Estuary plan 'remains the only credible solution, any process that fails to include it renders itself pretty much irrelevant, and I'm absolutely certain that it is the option that will eventually be chosen'.

Speaking later on his LBC radio phone-in, he condemned the idea of further expansion of Heathrow.

'With the best will in the world, expanding Heathrow is going to compound a planning error of the 1950s and 1960s; it's going to make life worse for London, it's going to make things pretty well intolerable for people in parts of the city that don't even know they're going to be under the new flight paths.' 

Defending his Boris Island plan, he added: 'What this lacks is not planning ability; what this lacks is political will. 

'What's happened this morning is basically that Sir Howard has decided that he's simply not finding enough support in Whitehall for an idea that is as adventurous and as risky, as he puts it, as the Estuary solution.'

He insisted the idea was not now dead. 'No, not at all, no more than, say, the Channel Tunnel was dead 100 years' ago when it was first rejected.'

Mr Johnson wanted to see a new four-runway airport built in the Thames Estuary, which would have cost tens of billions of pounds

These are the remaining shortlisted options:

But Labour said the plan would never have got off the ground.

Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'Boris Johnson's fantasy island airport plan which would have closed Heathrow and caused longer passenger journeys has finally been dashed.

'Time and public money should never have been spent on his vanity project whose costs have been put at up to £100 billion.

'This back of a fag packet scheme was designed less for the country's economic future and more for the omnishables Mayor's political ambitions.'

Dale Keller, chief executive of the Board of Airline Representatives, said: 'Airlines were never convinced that the Thames Estuary was either affordable or a convenient location for the majority of their customers. 

'Since airlines and their passengers will ultimately have to pay for the development costs of the selected expansion site then the business case must stack up in order for the UK to remain globally competitive. 

'We call upon Boris to support the important work of the Airports Commission and ensure that the right decisions are made about Heathrow and Gatwick.'

The rejection of the estuary scheme will leave just three options - two additional runway plans at Heathrow and one at Gatwick - still on the table for consideration by the commission, which is charged with recommending where airport expansion should come.

Headed by former Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies, the commission is due to make its final report to ministers in summer 2015 - after the general election.

For many, the favourite option is expansion at Heathrow - an idea that has been totally rejected by Mr Johnson.

The added complication for Mr Johnson is that he is now seeking the Tory 2015 general election candidacy at Uxbridge and South Ruislip - a constituency that borders on Heathrow and which contains many people who depend on the west London airport for their livelihood.

Last December the commission shortlisted the Heathrow and Gatwick options and said it would look further at the estuary option while admitting that it was extremely expensive.

Since then the commission has published reports showing the possible environment cost of the estuary plan. 

Mr Johnson's chief aviation adviser Daniel Moylan said yesterday that not short-listing the estuary option would be 'a sadly short-sighted decision but far from the end of the process'.

He went on: 'Airports policy has been stalled for nearly five decades, ricocheting like a billiard ball between Heathrow and Gatwick.

'We have one opportunity to break out of that but it seems the commission has taken us back to the same old, failed choice. But the final decision will lie with the Government and a key question now is whether the commission will play much of a role in that.' 

An extra runway at Heathrow could spell more problems for people living under flight paths in West London

Responding to the Airport Commission's decision to rule out the inner Thames estuary option, Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (Bata), said: 'Britain needs additional runway capacity in the South East of England, but not at any price.

'With the Thames estuary option sensibly ruled out for good, the Airports Commission is free now to concentrate on scrutinising the business cases of the three shortlisted options.

'The proposals must be cost-effective and offer value for money. There needs to be a credible funding mechanism based on realistic forecasts and today's passengers must not be expected to pay for tomorrow's infrastructure.'
