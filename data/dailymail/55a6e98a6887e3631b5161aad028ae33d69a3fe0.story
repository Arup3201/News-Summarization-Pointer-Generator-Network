Sixty soldiers have returned from Afghanistan to spend Christmas with their families. The members of the Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland (1 Scots), flew back to Edinburgh three months earlier than initially planned.

The Ministry of Defence said the move is part of the planned troop reduction in the country, which will see the number of service personnel in Afghanistan reduce from 9,500 to 9,000 before Christmas.

More than 3,800 British troops fighting in Afghanistan will be home by Christmas next year, David Cameron announced this week.

The soldiers will not be going back to Afghanistan after Christmas, and will spend the rest of the Battalion's tour carrying out rear party duties at Dreghorn Barracks

The Prime Minister made the decision after commanders told him that Afghan forces will be able to assume the lead role in combat operations across the country next year. UK forces are already beginning to pull out of mentoring Afghan troops at the frontline.

By the end of 2013, they will only advise at brigade level, leaving Afghan commanders to run combat operations. The plan is a further step to the withdrawal of all UK forces from a combat role by 2014, but ministers have denied that the process has been sped up.

The Prime Minister told the House of Commons that troop levels pitted against the Taliban are to be cut by almost half of their current strength by the end of 2013, down from 9,000 to 5,200.

All NATO 
operations are due to finish by the end of 2014 when responsibility will
be transferred to Afghan forces, but a number of British troops will 
remain in the country to work on the handover.

The
soldiers from 1 Scots had been deployed to Helmand Province in 
September this year, where they have been training and mentoring Afghan 
security forces. They have 
been able to hand over some of their bases to Afghan control and 
therefore the entire Battalion is no longer required to remain in the 
country.

The 
soldiers will not be going back to Afghanistan after Christmas, and will 
spend the rest of the Battalion's tour carrying out rear party duties at
Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh.

The
tour was tinged with sadness after the death of Captain Walter Barrie 
on Remembrance Day. The
soldier was shot dead by a rogue member of the Afghan army as he played
football. The 41-year-old was buried last month and was described as a 
'brilliant bloke' and a 'soldiers' soldier' by colleagues.

In another homecoming, crew members on board the Royal Navy mine hunter HMS Blyth sported Santa hats during their homecoming today as they celebrated being back in the UK in time for Christmas.

The Navy men and women received a warm but very wet welcome when they docked at HM Naval Base on the Clyde. They were greeted by family and friends who had waited patiently in the torrential rain. The 37-strong crew have just completed a six-month Nato deployment.

HMS Blyth left the base at Faslane, Argyll and Bute, for the Mediterranean and Black Sea in June, where it took part in training exercises with Turkish, German and Italian navies. Flag Officer Scotland Christopher Hockley, the most senior naval officer north of the border, said: 'Coming home is such a special day.

'They left before the Olympics — that's a long time ago. They are very proud and the Navy really appreciates the job that they've done. We are working our people really hard and we're particularly pleased we've got them back before Christmas.'

HMS Blyth anchored to the sounds of the Band of HM Royal Marines Scotland, and the crew rushed down the gangplank to hug their loved ones. Lieutenant Commander Tim Davey, Commanding Officer of the minehunter, was greeted by wife Caroline and daughters Ellen, seven, and Lauren, three.

Lt Cmdr Davey, 37, from Somerset, said: 'It's fantastic, it's lovely to be home just in time for Christmas. The entire crew are looking forward to spending the festive season at home and taking a well-deserved break.'

Mrs Davey, 36, said: 'It's been a long six months but it's a fantastic Christmas present for everybody. It's wonderful. So many families turned out in the pouring rain but it's definitely worth it to see everybody come home safe and well. There are such a lot of service families who won't have partners and husbands back for Christmas.'

HMS Blyth served as a 'command platform' during minehunting exercises and surveillance at sea. The
crew left their NATO colleagues at the beginning of December and made 
their way home after brief stops in the Turkish ports of Mersin and 
Aksaz.

The
deployment was the last for Petty Officer Al Gibb, from Edinburgh, who after 17 years is quitting the Navy — and the UK — for a new life in Australia with his
soon-to-be wife Beth Smith. The
couple met while naval woman Ms Smith, from Brisbane, was on an 
exchange to Navy school HMS Collingwood in Fareham, near Portsmouth, 
Hampshire.

They are due to marry on August 31 next year. PO
Gibb, 37, said: 'For the moment 
I'm just looking forward to getting back to Edinburgh, getting the 
central heating on and sitting down and relaxing for a bit.

Ms Smith, 33, said: 'I was up at 3.30am, I couldn't sleep, I was so excited. It's been strange being on the other end because, being in the Navy myself, I'm usually the one away on deployments.'
