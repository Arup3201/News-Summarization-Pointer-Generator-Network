Martha Stewart's company fired 100 employees on Thursday - an unwelcome surprise for workers in the run-up to Christmas.

The job losses came after Daniel Dienst - previously a scrap-metal recycling executive - took the helm as CEO at the struggling Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia two months ago.

Stewart, the company's 72-year-old chairwoman, was spotted last weekend mingling with an A-list crowd at the luxury international art fair Art Basel in Miami.

Martha, who holds to the motto 'It's a good thing' and is worth an estimated $300million, had been in Florida promoting the December issue of Martha Stewart Living magazine - the company's last-standing publication. 

'Just completed a cooking demo at Macys Aventura mall in Miami. What a great crowd. Delicious brunch recipes from MS Living dec issue,' the entrepreneur tweeted on December 7.

The doyenne of home-making was tweeting about her 'Martha' orchid blooming in time for the holidays and a TV appearance about holiday gift-giving on Thursday - the same day that dozens of staff were being ordered to clear their desks. 

Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia had no comment when contacted by MailOnline on Friday. 

Staff were seen leaving the company's 
Manhattan offices, many in tears with belongings stuffed in Martha 
Stewart bags after being escorted out of the building immediately by security guards, the New York Post reported.

The staffing cuts - about 20 per cent of the workforce - are expected to save the company $10million in the next year.

Stewart also took a pay cut this year - with the company slashing half a million off her salary to bring it down to $3.5million. 

According to corporate filings for this 
year's third quarter, total revenues were $33.8million - down from 
$43.5million in the same quarter in 2012.

The company was the subject of lawsuit from Macy's over licensing with J.C. Penney - forcing it to end a deal with the latter this year.

The knock-on effect was Penney's cut back on advertising in Martha Stewart's magazine and TV shows.

Analysts are predicting further losses for the lifestyle company next year.

In 2004, Stewart went to jail after being charged over the ImClone insider trading scandal.

She launched a comeback on her release the following year and her company showed profits in 2006.

She rejoined the board of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in 2011 and became chairman last year.
