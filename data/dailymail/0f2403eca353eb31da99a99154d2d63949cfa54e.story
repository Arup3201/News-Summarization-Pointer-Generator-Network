A University of Virginia student who shared a freshman suite with 'Jackie' when she was allegedly gang-raped at a fraternity party has defended her former roommate.

Emily Clark spoke out in support of Jackie in a letter published in The Cavalier Daily on Monday, three days after Rolling Stone acknowledged 'mistakes' in its reporting of the claims. 

'While I cannot say what happened that night, and I cannot prove the validity of every tiny aspect of her story to you, I can tell you that this story is not a hoax, a lie or a scheme,' Emily wrote.

'Something terrible happened to Jackie at the hands of several men who have yet to receive any repercussions.'

Shut:  Students walk past the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at UVa on Saturday after Rolling Stone apologized for mistakes in its story about an alleged rape there. The victim's friend has now spoken out in her defense

In the Rolling Stone article, Jackie said she had been lured into a room by a  member of Phi Kappa Psi and raped by seven men in 2012, when she was just starting out as a freshman.

The explosive article portrayed a culture of sexual violence at UVA, one of the nation's leading public universities, and rocked the campus.

The fraternity, which was suspended after the story was published, has denied the assault and in a statement on Friday, it said it didn't host an event on the night Jackie alleged she was raped.

After the statement, Rolling Stone released an apology that some took to blame Jackie. 

'Our trust in her was misplaced,' it said.

The magazine then quietly modified the apology to say: 'These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie. We apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening.'

In her letter on Monday, Emily said she has no doubt something happened to Jackie, who was 'bright, happy and bubbly' when she started at the college.

'That all notably changed by December 2012,' she wrote.

She - and others girls - noticed Jackie was becoming 'withdrawn and depressed', was skipping class and watching hours of TV instead. Then that December, she broke down.

'All of a sudden she was going home and none of us knew why,' she wrote. 'It was right before finals, and I couldn't believe she was leaving. She was distraught, and only said she needed to go home. Her teachers had given her allowance to take her finals over break.

'At that point, we knew something big had happened. I didn't know until this year with the publication of Rolling Stone's article how bad that time was for her.'

She said that later that year, Jackie did tell her that she had been attacked by several men at a party but that she did not give any more details on the incident. 

'I fully support Jackie, and I believe wholeheartedly that she went through a traumatizing sexual assault,' she wrote.

Despite Rolling Stone's apology, Jackie has said she stands by her story.

The magazine said it shouldn't have agreed to her request not to contact the alleged assailants to get their side of the story, out of sensitivity to her.

The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, has said that Jackie is now unsure if the man who allegedly lured her into the room to be raped by the seven men was a member of Phi Kappa Psi. 

After the apology, some advocates for rape victims expressed concern that the magazine's backpedaling could undermine efforts to combat campus sexual assaults.

The UVA Inter-Fraternity Council said that should not be allowed to happen.

'Sexual assault is a problem across college campuses, and we remain committed to being leaders in the campaign for long-term change,' the council said in a statement.

But three organizations said that, in light of the statement from the magazine, the university should lift its suspension of fraternity and sorority activities, which is underway until January 9. 

The Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee, the National Panhellenic Conference and the North-American Interfraternity Conference said U.Va. should apologize for a 'rush to judgment'. 

'We believe universities must demonstrate more respect for the fundamental rights to due process and freedom of association for students and student organizations when allegations of misconduct are lodged,' they said in the statement.

'A rush to judgment on campus all too often turns out to be wrong, especially when applied at the organizational level.'
