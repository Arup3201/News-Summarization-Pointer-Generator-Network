Ukrainian demonstrators demanding their government forms closer ties with the EU have forced riot police to retreat today after a pre-dawn raid on their protest camp.

In a blow to the authority of President Viktor Yanukovych after nearly three weeks of rallies against his rule, security forces were eventually forced into a humiliating retreat amid cheers from the demonstrators after the ranks of protesters swelled.

It followed a day of international pressure on the embattled leader, with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visiting the pro-EU protesters in Kiev and telling the president the attempted police crackdown was 'inadmissable'.

Several dozen were injured in the early hours when riot police and interior ministry special forces moved against the demonstrators who have occupied Kiev's Independence Square in anger at the rejection of a landmark EU pact.

'We have not won the war yet but we've decisively won this battle. The authorities are panicking,' said protester Anton Kulyk. 'We will continue to stand up for our country.'

The police move sparked unprecedented international criticism of Yanukovych, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressing 'disgust' at the crackdown.

Thousands of officers began moving in on the camp in the Ukranian capital Kiev after a stand-off lasting several weeks, which escalated on Sunday when demonstrators beheaded a statue of the Soviet Union founder Vladimir Lenin.

Tents were town down in Independence Square, barricades were dismantled and scuffles broke out. Protesters in sub-zero temperatures shouted 'Shame! Shame!' and sang the Ukranian national anthem as an Orthodox priest read prayers.

The stand-off continued in the early hoursas dawn approached and the transport network went into service, which some said could bring thousands more protestors into the downtown camp.

The clashes were roundly condemned by the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

'The
 United States expresses its disgust with the decision of Ukrainian 
authorities to meet the peaceful protest in Kyiv's Maidan Square with 
riot police, bulldozers, and batons, rather than with respect for 
democratic rights and human dignity,' he said in a widely-circulated 
statement. 'This response is neither acceptable nor does it befit a 
democracy.

'The United States stands with the people of Ukraine. They deserve better.'

Protests began in earnest last month 
when President Viktor Yanukovych backed away from a pact that would deepen the former 
Soviet republic's economic ties with the EU.

Surveys showed the pact was supported by nearly half the country's people - but it was opposed strongly by Russia, which has either controlled or 
heavily influenced Ukraine for centuries.

Moscow has worked aggressively to 
derail the deal and lure Kiev into its own economic group by
 offering price discounts and loans, as well as imposing painful trade 
restrictions.

As protestors wore bright orange helmets to protect themselves from police, one undressed to his waist, got down on his knees and shouted 'Stop this ... We are one people!'

Some poured water on the ground in front of the barricades so it would freeze and make the ground slippery for police. Others shouted 'We will stand' and an opposition lawmaker laid down on the snow try to block a police vehicle.

Several
 protesters were injured in tonight's clashes. Some policemen helped 
injured activists up from the ground and moved them away.

Kiev
 police said authorities were merely trying to clear the streets leading
 to Independence Square, but not to remove the main encampment, the 
Ukrainian Interfax news agency reported.

Opposition
 leader Vitali Klitschko, who is the reigning world heavyweight boxing 
champion, urged Ukrainians to rush to the centre of the capital to 
defend democracy.

'We will say no to a police state, no to a dictatorship,' he told the protesters.

The
 confrontation tonight unfolded as EU foreign policy chief Catherine 
Ashton and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland were in the
 city to try and negotiate a solution.

After she was earlier cheered by crowds on a visit to the protest site, Baroness Ashton said she was saddened at the violence used to dislodge protesters from their camps.

She said in a statement posted on Facebook: 'I was among you on Maidan [Independence Square] in the evening and was impressed by determination of Ukrainians demonstrating for European perspective of the country.

'Some hours later I observe with sadness that police uses force to remove peaceful people from the centre of Kiev. The authorities didn't need to act under the coverage of night to engage with the society by using police.'

Embattled: President Viktor Yanukovych said he was continuing to form a deal with the EU

Aiming to defuse the crisis, Yanukovych called yesterday for demonstrators who had previously been arrested to be released.

He
 has vowed the country still wants to be integrated with Europe, but 
only in Spring if the EU can offer better financial terms.

He insisted the deal as it stands 
could cost the economically struggling nation billions in lost trade with 
Russia, which has used trade threats to try to keep Ukraine in its 
orbit.

Meanwhile Ukraine is in dire economic straits - it
 has been in recession for more than a year, and the government is in 
desperate need of foreign funding to avoid bankruptcy.

Protesters have demanded more decisive action.

Soon after Yanukovych spoke in a televised broadcast, opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk told demonstrators at the square that protest leaders were still insisting on their key demands.

They said Yanukovych should fire the government, appoint a new one committed to signing an association agreement with the EU, release all the arrested protesters, and punish all police who beat peaceful demonstrators.

Riot police have twice previously dispersed demonstrators with clubs and tear gas, beating some badly enough to send them to intensive care.

Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's first president, said: 'Law enforcement must know that it is forbidden to beat people. There can be no justification.'

Yanukovych, however, insisted both sides were guilty.

The President, in a televised meeting with Ukraine's three previous presidents, said he asked the prosecutor-general to ensure the release of some of the protesters - those who haven't committed grave crimes and who have children or families.

However, police would continue to investigate the actions of the freed protesters, he said.

'We want to achieve conditions that satisfy Ukraine, Ukrainian producers, the Ukrainian people,' Yanukovych said in the televised meeting.

'If we find understanding and if such compromises are reached, the signature will be put.'

Destruction: Tents and belongings which were dismantled at the camp, which has lasted several weeks

The EU's enlargement commissioner, Stefan Fule, said yesterday the EU was prepared to offer better terms.

Kravchuk and his successor, Leonid Kuchma, hinted that Prime Minister Mykola Azarov's resignation could help resolve the crisis, but Yanukovych did not comment on that.

At a separate event, Kravchuk called for a nationwide round table involving both authorities and opposition members, but it was unclear when or how such a meeting would take place.

Yanukovych said he would renew talks with the International Monetary Fund about getting a bailout loan.

But some analysts were sceptical that Yanukovych's pro-EU talk was genuine, believing he was still trying to play off Russia against the bloc.

'I am not sure these comments will be taken that seriously after the fiasco in the run-up to Vilnius,' where the agreement was to have been signed, said Tim Ash, an emergency markets analyst with London's Standard Bank.
