A false leg, a set of mountain bikes and a giant crab are among items left behind on coaches.

The ten-legged crab was taken on board by a Chinese couple who could not speak English, National Express said.

They had bought a child's ticket for the crab which was found on a Coventry to Inverness service.

Forgotten: A Chinese couple who could not speak English left a ten-legged crab on board a National Express coach 

As there were no seaside stops on the route, a special coach was chartered to drop the crab off at the end of Blackpool Pier on the advice of marine biologists.

The false leg had been worn, and subsequently removed, by a passenger who disembarked without it, while the mountain bikes were left in their boxes.

Other items forgotten by passengers included:

Peculiar list: Other items left on National Express Coaches included a pair of full-sized feathered American Indian head dresses and a bag containing two lime green 'mankinis'

National Express lost property manager Claire Horvath said: 'It's absolutely unbelievable the things people leave on the coaches and on more than one occasion I've been left rubbing my eyes in the lost property room.

'The Indian head dresses were one of the more unusual items left behind. I mean, we've all mislaid glasses or a mobile phone but how do you forget something that size?'
