Maria Sharapova survived a second-round scare as she saved two match points against world No 150 Alexandra Panova before completing the comeback to progress to the last 32 of the Australian Open.

The world No 2 was on the brink of a shock defeat at the hands of her Russian compatriot but somehow triumphed 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 in a Rod Laver Arena thriller lasting two hours and 32 minutes.

Sharapova, who hit a total of 51 unforced errors throughout the match, said: 'It was a tough day but I pulled through. I guess at this point that's what matters.

'It certainly gives me a lot of confidence that I didn't play my best tennis and was able to come through. Sometimes that's good.'

Qualifier Panova, 25, had reached the second round of a Grand Slam for the first time in six attempts but her run looked set to end on Wednesday when Sharapova took just 26 minutes to move a set ahead.

However, a Sharapova double fault at the start of the second set gifted the break to Panova who later claimed another break to move 5-2 ahead.

Although Panova failed to serve out the set at the first time of asking, she made no mistake the second time on her fourth set point to level the match.

Panova gave Sharapova a real fright in the third set 

Sharapova looked vulnerable as she netted a routine backhand to go an early break down in the deciding set and another Panova break for 4-1 had the Melbourne crowd believing.

Although Sharapova claimed one of the breaks back, Panova stepped up to serve for the match at 5-4 and was on the cusp of victory with two match points but Sharapova saved both with two booming forehands before levelling at 5-5.

With Panova looking deflated, there was only one winner from there and Sharapova broke to seal the comeback as Panova hit wide.

Sharapova said: 'I was down two breaks in the third. The only belief I had was just try to get into the rallies.

'She served some really good games out there where I didn't have much chances. When I did, I thought I could put a little more thought into her mind, get those first serves back.

'I think that was really important. I think she became a little bit more tentative in that last game. Of course, based on experience, you lift yourself up both mentally and physically.'
