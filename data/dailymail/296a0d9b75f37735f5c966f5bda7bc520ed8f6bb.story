A family was struck by lightning while driving in their car in southern Utah - and they caught the whole thing on camera.

Taylor, Denham and Tanner Morlock were driving with their dad through torrential rain when Taylor remarked, 'I hope we get hit by lightning.'

Moments later, his wish was granted when their SUV's antenna was struck by a bolt of lightning.

Blazing hot: As sparks flew off the windscreen wiper, the car became unbearably hot

The footage one of the boys took on his camera phone shows sparks flying and family's exclamations of disbelief.

'Holy crap!' yells one of the family as the car's electrics fade.

'It's hot, it's scary, it's loud,' said Denham Morlock of the experience.

'It's just blazing hot,' said Taylor Morlock.

Make a wish: Taylor Morlock doesn't know why he said he wished the Morlock car would be struck by lightning - but he'll be careful what he wishes for in future

The family's journey to Church Wells in Utah was cut short after the shocking lightning strike. The car's antenna was completely burnt out and all the electrical gauges shut off.

No one was injured, but the lightning bolt also blew three of the car's tires and the family had to wait for a tow truck.

The family told KSL that several of their cellphones and gaming devices in the car had dead batteries, but after the lighting strike, the electronics were all fully charged again.

Hot, scary and loud: The Morlock brothers say the experience of being in a car hit by lightning was exciting - and terrifying

The boys say the experience was exciting - but not one they're in a hurry to repeat.

'It reached inside my stomach and twisted my insides,' Tanner told KSL.

'I kind of feel like it's your fault when you said, "Oh, I wish we'd get struck by lightning,"' Denham said, turning to his brother Taylor.

'He should never say it again.'
