A mother who spent years blaming herself for her seven-year-old daughter's death has discovered the NHS secretly fired her paramedic for medical negligence.

For three years, Lorna Easen agonised over whether she could have done more after her daughter Izabelle Easen died at her home in Thorne, South Yorkshire, in April 2009, from an asthma attack brought on by a cardiac arrest.

Mrs Easen said she had felt partially responsible for not knowing how to perform emergency first aid.

But her family said they were never 
told the paramedic who worked on her, James McKenna, later faced a 
'fitness to practise' hearing after he failed to perform advanced 
life-saving techniques.

The paramedic was struck off in 2010 after the Health Professions Council (HPC) heard about Izabelle's case and other, separate incidents - including one in which he 'behaved without compassion, feeling or tact towards the patient and his family'.

Mrs Easen told Sky News: 'It's morally wrong, if nothing else. Absolutely terrible.

'They should have informed me. They should have informed the police as far as I'm concerned. It's my child, not theirs. To them she's just a piece of paperwork.'

Papers from the HPC about Mr McKenna's case do not mention Izabelle's name.

They show how Mr McKenna did not 
perform advanced life support and that he pronounced the patient dead 
after only performing basic life support.

A technician on a second ambulance 
wanted to take the little girl to hospital, which he said would have 
'given the family some support' but was overruled by Mr McKenna.

Experts have said, though, that the chances were that Izabelle was unlikely to have survived even if these actions had been taken.

Denials: Wakefield Trust said there had been no policy of keeping any information from the Easen family

Mr McKenna was only brought before the HPC after an audit of the documentation.

A spokeswoman for Yorkshire Ambulance Service, which is part of Wakefield District NHS Primary Care Trust, said: 'It has not been, and is not, our intention to keep information from the family concerned and we would like to reassure them and members of the public that we are committed to being open with patients and their relatives.

'We understand the additional distress raising this again will cause the patient's family and we would be willing to meet with them and discuss any concerns they may have.'

An HPC spokeswoman said the council 'operates transparent and open fitness to practise processes' and stressed its hearings are held in public and are well advertised in advance.

Kelly Johnson, HPC director of fitness
to practise, said: 'It is often the case that it is the employer of the
registrant that raises the concern.

'In cases such as these, we are not always informed of the identity of the patients involved.

'The HPC has a statutory responsibility to liaise with the complainant(s) whether it is an individual or employer and is committed to ensuring that they are kept up to date with the progress of our investigation.

'Often family members, who are not complainants, are not required to provide evidence at hearings; however, we are taking steps to ensure that they are informed of the hearing by the employer where appropriate.'

The case is one of a number uncovered by a Sky News investigation in which relatives have not been told about paramedics being disciplined after treating members of their families.
