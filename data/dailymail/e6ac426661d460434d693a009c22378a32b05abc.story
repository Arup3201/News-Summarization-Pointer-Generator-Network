Argentina is planning on instituting a new banknote with a map of the Falkland Islands, and a folk hero who led a bloody uprising in the long-disputed territory, in a move that may enrage the British.

Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner announced the move to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Falklands War with Britain, which cost the lives of nearly 1,000 soldiers.

The 50 peso note will be legal currency in the next year, and will be worth around £3.75.

The note will carry the image of the archipelago on one side, and on the other side there will be an image of controversial figure Antonio Rivero, a cowboy who led an uprising against the British in August 1833.

The vigilante, nicknamed the Gaucho, went unpunished at the time because a court system had not been established.

Eventually, due to never being prosecuted, he was revered as a hero in Argentina. 

President Kirchner has previously pledged an 'eternal fight' for the Falklands, and was described as pleased with the creation of the new banknote.

Argentina have long been at odds with the British due to Falkland Islands being part of British territory, and their latest move of having an Argentinian hero and the Falkland Islands on their currency may be a move that enrages the British

A government spokesman described the new banknote's creation as 'an act of historic, social and political re-vindication of our sovereign of our sovereign rights.'

After the speech at Argentina's government house, an Argentinian flag was removed to show giant mock-up of the bank note.

The spokesman afterwards referred to the Falkland Islands by their Spanish name, Islas Malvinas.

They then said: 'This is a homage to our Islas Malvinas and to all those who gave their lives to this cause. 

'It
 will compel every Argentinian to keep alive on a daily basis the flames
 of love for our islands which are and always will be Argentinian.'

Mrs Kirchner went on to describe the Falklands as the 'largest military and nuclear NATO base in the South Atlantic.'

She then urged Britain to dedicate less time to making war and focus more time to its own population.

She said: 'History shows that colonial enclaves are always recovered.'

At a speech last April to mark the 31st anniversary of the war, Mrs Kirchner lambasted Britain's refusal to negotiate over the Falklands, calling them 'incomprehensible'.

A Falklands referendum found that just three of the 1,517 people who voted said they were opposed to remaining a UK overseas territory.
