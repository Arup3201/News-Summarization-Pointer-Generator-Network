The family of former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher are rallying around his furious wife following reports the rock star fathered a love child, it emerged today.

The 40-year-old singer allegedly has a seven-month-old daughter called Emma following a  
long-running affair with U.S. showbusiness writer Liza Ghorbani.

Claims about the lovechild have reportedly left Gallagher's wife Nicole Appleton furious, leading to her allegedly banning him from returning home.

Angry: Claims about the lovechild have reportedly left Gallagher's wife Nicole Appleton furious. She has allegedly banned him from returning home

As reported by the Daily Mirror today, Gallagher's family yesterday rallied around his 38-year-old wife after the allegations emerged.

One relative said: 'Liam has only got himself to blame - he's just too wild. I said he should never have got married.'

It was claimed yesterday that Gallagher 
told Miss Ghorbani that the baby girl 
'is beautiful' and has his 'rock star genes'.

The enigmatic frontman bragged about his musical DNA to his alleged former lover, according to reports in the United States.

'Livid': Miss Appleton, left, and Gallagher have a 12-year-old son. They were married in 2008. It has been claimed his affair with Miss Ghorbani began after she profiled him for the New York Times

Last year Gallagher bought a 
£1.6million apartment in Manhattan, close to Central Park and not far 
from where Emma is being raised.

Gallagher
 has said the baby is 'a beautiful 
child because she has “rock star genes”’, the New York Post claimed.

It alleged Gallagher’s relationship with Miss Ghorbani ended only after Emma was born.

Unmarried Miss Ghorbani, 39, has told 
friends their affair ended and then resumed again, according to another 
newspaper, the New York Daily News.

It
 quoted a friend as saying: ‘It went on until she told him she was 
pregnant. He cut it off. He was so paranoid his wife would find out.’

Their
 trysts are alleged to have began after the music journalist met the singer 
in 2010 and wrote a glowing interview for the New York Times, entitled A
 Night Out With Liam Gallagher.

It
 was also claimed that since the allegations were made, his furious 
wife, All Saints singer Nicole Appleton, is said to be livid.

A friend said: ‘Nicole has told Liam not to come home, at least not for a few weeks, and is furious.’

A
 spokesman for Mr Gallagher told MailOnline yesterday that his lawyers were 
still taking action against the New York Post and would not be 
commenting further.

There has been no sign of Miss Appleton, 38, at the couple’s £2.7million five-bedroom townhouse in Hampstead, North London.

Gallagher,
 40, is in Spain, where he appeared unfazed as he downed cocktails yesterday. He 
was drinking a mystery brunette in a black bikini, who stroked
 his head as they lay beside a hotel pool in Ibiza.

Starting
 at 11.30am, the former Oasis frontman drank more than a dozen mojitos 
and several tequila shots as he laughed and joked with friends.

The previous night his new band Beady Eye had performed at the Ibiza Rocks festival.

Afterwards
 he was said to have looked ‘happy and relaxed’ as he mingled with 
female fans and posed for photographs at Pikes Hotel, a favourite 
celebrity haunt in San Antonio, and danced topless on his room balcony, 
which overlooks the bar, until 2.30am.

Gallagher flew to Alicante yesterday to play at the Benicassim festival. He has 
made no public comment on what his spokesman says is ‘gossip’.

Gallagher has taken steps to prevent 
the story spreading, instructing London law firm Harbottle & Lewis 
to write warning letters to newspapers making inquiries about the 
singer’s reaction to the claims.

He is also reported to have hired a 
lawyer in New York to defend himself against a paternity suit brought by
 Miss Ghorbani at the Manhattan Family Court.

She
 is  alleged to be seeking £2million. After paying for the medical costs
 of the birth herself, Miss Ghorbani began the legal action and arranged
 a DNA test for her baby.

Gallagher’s
 lawyers are taking unspecified ‘action’ against the New York Post for 
naming him as the father, but on Thursday it made further claims.

A
 source told the newspaper: ‘Liza met Liam when she interviewed him and 
they began an affair [which] continued until around three months after 
the birth of the child. He ended the relationship when she told him she 
was suing him for child support.

‘Liza isn’t after millions of dollars, she is simply seeking child support and no amount has yet been set. If they don’t settle on a figure, the case will go to a public trial.’ 

Miss Ghorbani, who specialises in 
interviewing rock stars, is said to be staying with her parents at their £500,000 house in 
McLean, Virginia.

Her mother Sylvia, 63 – who was born in Lancashire and moved to America aged 19 – declined to comment.

She is a teacher at a local school, while her husband, Iranian-born Daryoush, 65, runs his own mobile home business.

Friends claim that Gallagher left it to another family member to break the news of the love child allegations to his mother.

A source said: ‘They thought Liam should have done it himself.

‘His family have also advised Liam to see a top lawyer for the court case – and to consult a top divorce lawyer as well.

‘They
 are concerned for Liam. They say he’s “chaos” and that they are worried
 that he won’t stop his partying lifestyle until he makes himself ill.’ 

Friends of Canadian-born Miss Appleton
 say she never suspected her husband of cheating on her, despite his 
history – he already has three children by three women. Two of those 
were born during marriage.

Gallagher married his first wife, actress Patsy Kensit, in 1997. But only a couple of months later he fathered a child with singer Lisa Moorish.

Their daughter Molly is now 15. Gallagher and Miss Kensit had a son, Lennon, now 13, in 1999. In 2001, Gallagher had another son, Gene, now 12, with Miss Appleton, whom he married in 2008.

In the same year, Gallagher boasted he was a ‘top dad’ who had turned his back on a rock’n’roll lifestyle to be there for his family.

The singer revealed he had never intended to become a father but insisted: ‘Once you get your missus pregnant, you’ve got to step up to the plate.’
