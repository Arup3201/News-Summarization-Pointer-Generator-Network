A man sentenced to life behind bars for the rape and murder of his wife in 1994 has walked out of prison after newly-analysed DNA evidence has placed another man at the crime scene.

After 18 years in prison, John Grega, 50, left the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, Vermont on Wednesday with bags of his belongings and an enormous grin.

The former NASA subcontractor, originally from Long Island, New York, embraced his overjoyed siblings and mother, who had earlier posted $75,000 bail for his release.

Walking free: John Grega walks out of the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield, Vermont on Wednesday after a judge vacated his life sentence and ordered a retrial

'I always said I would walk out,' Grega told the Brattleboro Reformer as he hugged his family and his attorney, Ian Carleton. 'I never gave up. I feel good.'

It comes nearly two decades after Grega was convicted of raping and murdering his wife Christine, 
31, while they were on holiday at a West Dover condominium with their 
two-year-old son.

His lawyers filed a motion last month to have his conviction thrown out in light of newly analysed DNA evidence that appears to show someone else might have been involved in the brutal killing.

A hearing was set for Friday but Judge John Wesley shocked the family when, on Tuesday, he said Grega should be freed immediately on bail.

Relief: Grega, who has been behind bars for 18 years, was embraced by his mother, siblings and attorney

Happiness: Grega with his brother Anthony Grega and sister Chrissy DiGiancinto. He was freed after tests earlier this year found an unknown male's DNA on his wife's murdered body

It is the first time a conviction has been thrown out under a 2008 Vermont law that allowed convicted
felons to request DNA testing that might not have been available at the
time of their trials.

Questions remain about how the prosecutors and defense will handle the 18-year-old evidence and witnesses, Carleton told the Banner.

'This is uncharted territory,' Carleton 
said. 'We are all trying to get through this first half hour. I’m sure 
we’ll figure out what comes next quickly.'

Grega embraced his new freedom, feasting on  lobster, prime 
rib, salad and iced tea at a Vermont restaurant, then snacking on peanut 
M&M's on the way to his mother's house, Newsday reported.

He went swimming and enjoyed a cigar as he looked at the sky, he added.

'It was just phenomenal,' he said. 'I've dreamed about this for so long. I'm finally home.

'I knew in my heart it wasn't my destiny to spend the rest of my life 
there. I never let them break me.'

Southern State Correctional Facility 
Superintendent Mark Potanas said Grega was a model prisoner.

He worked as the librarian in the prison’s 
legal library and helped other inmates work through legal texts while fighting to throw out their convictions. 'He’s a very well-spoken young man,' Potanas told the Reformer. 'If I had more inmates like him I’d be a happy man.'

Grega's wife Christine was found 
murdered on September 12, 1994 after being strangled, raped and beaten 
and dumped in the bathtub of the holiday condo.

Going home: On conditions of his release, he must stay with his mother (right), check in with police daily and not contact his wife's family - including his son, who is now 20

Grega became a suspect after giving conflicting stories about what had happened that day; he first claimed the injuries were accidental and then blamed the murder on two painters working there.

In November 2010, His attorneys requested that items collected from the scene, including swabs of Christine's body, be retested and they were carried out in May.

The tests showed male DNA that did not match Grega, the Reformer reported.

'We now have compelling 
evidence that John Grega did not commit the crime for which he has 
served nearly two decades in jail,' his attorneys wrote as they requested he be freed.

Grega has been ordered to stay at his mother's home in Ronkonkoma and will have to check in daily with local police. He is also barred from contacting his wife's family and his son, who is now 20.
