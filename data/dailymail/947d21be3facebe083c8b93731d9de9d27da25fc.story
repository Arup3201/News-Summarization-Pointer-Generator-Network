Video interviews with victims of celebrity sex abusers including Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall have been stolen, sparking fears they could have been used in a blackmail plot.

As many as 50 testimonies from victims were reportedly taken from a flat used by a film-making company working on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service.

The tapes are believed to include filmed statements made by those accusing a number of high profile names, including notorious paedophile Savile, and former sports presenter Hall, 84, who is serving a total of 60 months behind bars for numerous indecent assault charges.

Police fear that the tapes, thought to have been stolen by a criminal gang, could have been used for blackmail or leaked online - potentially jeopardising future prosecutions.

Four police forces have been deployed to help with the probe, and officers have been sent to Poland to help trace those responsible. 

So far, six men have been arrested for burglary and handling stolen goods following the break in at the Swan Films premises in Fallowfield, Manchester,on September 11.

Police say the items taken have since been recovered. 

One highly-placed source said: 'There were serious concerns about the implications of this robbery,' a source involved in the investigation told the Sunday Mirror.

'Officers were terrified future trials could collapse due to the evidence being compromised and there were also concerns that the videos could be uploaded on to social media or even be used as part of a future blackmail plot.'

A CPS spokesman told MailOnline that items thought to have been taken in the break-in included interviews with victims and witnesses that had been sent to Swan Films since August 1.

The tapes stolen were not the master copies of the interviews, and sensitive information held on computers that have subsequently been recovered had not been accessed between the time they were taken, and returned.   

'Following a burglary at the premises of Swan Films, a Manchester based video editing contractor for the CPS, we are currently cooperating with the ongoing police investigation,' he said.

'During the burglary it is believed that material relating to a small number of cases, including some police interviews with victims or witnesses, sent to the company since  August 1 this year and within the Greater Manchester area, were stolen. 

'Master copies of all material are retained by the prosecution. The computers containing this information have now been recovered and we can confirm that the sensitive information they contained was not accessed between the time they were stolen and their recovery.

'The CPS has secured all material which remained at the burgled premises and is asking for an urgent explanation of the security measures in place. We have worked with the police to identify the victims and witnesses who have been involved in the cases affected and are informing them of the successful recovery of the material in question.' 

Savile is now known to have abused hundreds of young victims over six decades. But the former Top Of The Pops presenter, who received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 – a year before the allegations emerged in an ITV documentary after the BBC shelved a Newsnight investigation into the star. 

Hall was jailed for 30 months last year after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 young girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period.

In May he was ordered to serve an extra two and a half years for sexually assaulting another underage girl.
