Another Carnival cruise ship has lost power at sea.

This time the lights went out on the 2,056-passenger Carnival Ecstasy.

The ship was sailing off the coast of Florida at the time of the incident.

Worst place to have a fire: In 1998 the Carnival Ecstasy was ablaze after a fire in the laundry room. Thankfully, this weeks outage saw the light go out for less than half an hour

It made for more uneasy moments for passengers who had decided to choose the Carnival Cruise line for their spring vacation.

Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said the cause of the power failure on Wednesday evening was a mechanical issue. The company say the problem was quickly fixed.

The power failure shut down hotel services and the engines on the Carnival Ecstasy on Wednesday night as it was approaching its home port of Port Canaveral, Florida after a five-day cruise.

Speaking toÂ WESH-TV passengers described the moment when everything on the ship suddenly went black.

'We were at dinner and all the lights went out, the whole ship went dark and the engine stopped,' said Mattie Lackore. 'We were dead in the water.'

She said her daughter made her pack protein bars and water just in case something went wrong during the voyage.

'Knowing what happened in the past, you kind of wonder. We got nervous,' said passenger Janine Bratcher.

The problem lasted for 12 minutes. The Ecstasy is now on a four-day voyage to the Bahamas.

Carnival Ecstasy carries approximately 2,000 passengers and 920 crew members. It made its first voyage in 1991 and was refurbished in 2009.

In 1998 a fire onboard the ship caused minor injuries to 14 crew members and eight passengers, and 'extensive damage.'

It was likely caused by welding by crew members in the main laundry room, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

Upgrade: Carnival is hoping scenes like this will be a thing of the past. The company is spending $300 million upgrading its fire prevention and generator capacity on its fleet of 24 ships

Bad run: Carnival has had a number of incidents in recent months with at least four ships affected

The latest power cut happened just as the Carnival Corporation announced they are to spend more than $300 million to improve the reliability of its 24 ships.

Each ship will get an additional emergency generator. There will also be upgrades to each ships fire systems and engine-related electrical components.

The company said the idea for the fixes came after a review that took place after the Carnival Triumph engine room fire in February.

In that instance, the ship was left adrift in the Gulf of Mexico forcing 4,000 passengers and crew to be stranded at sea for days, without power or working toilets.

Passengers described miserable conditions as the ship was towed to Mobile, Alabama.

The past couple of months have seen a number of other incidents to added to Carnival's wrap sheet:

Last week the Carnival Fascination failed a recent CDC health inspection; in March the Carnival Legend developed a propulsion system problem and the Carnival Dream became stuck in port after its emergency diesel generator failed.
