It's football's favourite wet blanket. No matter how breath-taking the accomplishment, there will always be some cynic who queries, half-seriously, whether they could have done it on a wet midweek in Stoke.

'Lionel Messi has just scored a wonderful hat-trick in the Clasico!' 'Yeah great, but I bet he couldn't do it on a windy, wintry night at the Britannia.'

It is a real compliment to Stoke City that a visit there is regarded so difficult it has become the subject of a million pub retorts.

But, as Chelsea prepare to make the trip to the Potteries on Monday night, is playing Stoke in their own backyard really that daunting for the Premier League elite?

Well, it depends who you are. While Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City have found the place a graveyard in recent years, Chelsea and Manchester United seem to thrive there.

Indeed, the Blues' 3-2 reverse there last season is their only loss at the Britannia since Stoke came into the Premier League in 2008.

Chelsea have won three and drawn two of their trips there, the most memorable being a 4-0 thrashing in January 2013 built on two own goals by Jonathan Walters.

Jose Mourinho s still chasing his first win on the ground but with Chelsea in imperious form, they will start as strong favourtes on Monday night.

Manchester United also slipped up there last season, losing 2-1, but were unbeaten under Sir Alex Ferguson's leadership.

They twice won by a single-goal margin and twice by a two-goal margin, with the meeting in September 2011 ending in a 1-1 draw.

By contrast, the prospect of a visit to Stoke strikes fear into the hearts of Arsenal fans - and Arsene Wenger.

The Gunners have won just once in seven visits there, losing on four occasions, and the trip inevitably ends in injuries, accusations of being soft and Wenger moaning about Stoke's bully-boy tactics.

They have already made the trip this season, back at the beginning of the month, and went down 3-2, with Peter Crouch scoring after 19 seconds and Calum Chambers seeing red.

A Walters penalty did for them last season and he rounded off a 3-1 win for Stoke back in May 2011. Back in November 2008, Robin van Persie was sent off in a 2-1 loss, sealed by a Seyi Olofinjana goal.

Liverpool, too, have suffered on their visits to Stoke. Their 5-3 win last season is their only win in six.

Walters, who seems to thrive against the big teams, scored twice in a 3-1 win back on Boxing Day 2012 and his penalty saw off the Reds in September 2011.

Ricardo Fuller and Kenwyne Jones were on target to settle the contest a year earlier.

It's not a happy hunting ground for Manchester City either, who have not won at the Britannia since Stoke were promoted into the Premier League.

Five of their six meetings have ended all-square, while James Beattie's goal proved the winner for 10-man Stoke back in January 2009.

Even in their title-winning campaigns, City have been incapable of winning at Stoke. It finished 0-0 last season and ended 1-1 back in March 2012, when Yaya Toure cancelled out a Crouch opener.

So, there is certainly plenty of evidence to suggest there is truth in the 'wet night in Stoke' put-down but some teams seem to have cracked the code.
