Obsessed: Prison diaries kept by Amanda Knox claim that jail guard Raffaele Argiro repeatedly quizzed her about previous lovers

Amanda Knox was repeatedly questioned about her sex life by a senior prison guard during the four years she spent in an Italian jail, it has been claimed.

The 24-year-old, who landed in her home city of Seattle last night after being cleared of the murder of Meredith Kercher, was reportedly quizzed in Perugia's La Capanne jail by deputy prison chief Raffaele Argiro.

The Italian prison guard was 'obsessed' with talking to Knox about her sex life and often called the American into his office for late-night 'chit chats', according to The Sun.

The revelations were made by Knox in a written account of her four-year stint in La Capanne prison, Perugia, during which she was initially convicted of killing British student Meredith, 21.

Knox is reported to have said of guard Argiro: 'He was fixed on the topic of sex - who I'd done it with and how I liked it.'

'When I realised he wanted to talk to me about sex, I would try to change the subject.'

Knox's prison journal also claims that Argiro accompanied her on all medical visits at the jail, and would quiz her on her sex life as a form of provocation to test her mental state.

The revealing account of her time in jail in Perugia even claims that she was told she was HIV positive just days after being locked up.

She had an agonising two-week wait before a further test showed she was negative, according to the prison diary.

The diary adds: 'I realise he was 
testing me to see if I reacted badly, to understand my personality. He 
also wanted to know with whom I had gone to bed, probably to give the 
police other names of suspects.'

The Sun reported that when approached, Argiro admitted asking Knox privately about how many boyfriends she had had.

However, the senior guard denied he initiated the intimate conversations, and said it was Knox who 'always' started talking about sex.

Argiro also reportedly confessed he was present when Knox underwent medical tests 'in case she did something wrong', before also admitting to quizzing her about Meredith's death in a bid to build the prosecution against her.

The revelations came as Knox touched down at Seattle-Tacoma Airport at around 5pm yesterday, following a £4,000 business class BA flight from Rome to Seattle.

After dramatically being cleared of the murder in court on Monday, Knox made an emotional thank you speech from the airport, addressing all those who stood by her since her murder conviction and saying: 'Thank you for being there for me'.

Summoning the courage to speak after her flight touched down, she said: 'I’m really overwhelmed right now. I was looking down from the aeroplane, I felt like it wasn’t real.

'Thank you for everyone who has believed in me, who has defended me, who has supported my family.

'I just want – my family’s the most important thing to me... Thank you for being there for me.'

Her appearance was met with loud applause from those who had waited all day at the airport to see her.

The language student is thought to be spending time with family and friends before considering her next move as a free woman.

She had served four years of a 26-year prison sentence after being found guilty in 2009 of the brutal sex murder of Meredith, 21, who was found semi naked with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the girls shared in Perugia, Italy.

Former love: Knox is hoping to be reunited with David Johnsrud who was her boyfriend before she left for Italy

Knox has been planning her home-coming celebration in detail since the early days of her incarceration, drawing up an exhaustive list of things she wants to do now she is finally free.

Notes from the diary that detectives encouraged her to keep reveal the extensive plans she had made, and even the list of 42 guests.

Taking pride of place will have been her maths teacher, mother and stepfather, Chris Mellas, her father Curt, a financial executive, and his wife Cassandra, plus her sister Deanna, 22, and stepsisters Ashley, 16, and Delaney, 13, all of whom were at court on Monday and led the cheering.

She now also hopes to be reunited with David Johnsrud, the boyfriend with whom she broke up when they left the University of Washington to travel on exchange programmes, he to China, she to Perugia.

Knox has already been offered £650,000 by a U.S. television station for a first interview, and according to experts could earn as much as £50m from lucrative book, TV and film deals.

Amanda Knox received a hero’s welcome in prison when she returned for the final time before she left to fly home to America.

When she returned to Capanne prison to collect her belongings after dramatically being acquitted by the appeals court, hundreds of fellow inmates cheered from their cells, leaning out of windows and chanting her name.

‘All the prisoners, 500 or 600 of them, started to greet Amanda from the windows, like soccer stardom,’ Corrado Maria Daclon, secretary general of the USA Italy Foundation, said.

‘It's difficult to describe the happiness of them seeing Amanda and greeting her and seeing her free now - yelling, 'Oh, wow, ciao Amanda!' It was really, really incredible emotion.’

Daclon told ABC News that as Knox walked through the prison’s central square, which is surrounded by prison blocks, inmates leant out of their tiny windows, waving their clothes in the air, like flags.

‘All the prison was greeting her like a champion,’ he said.

He added that she was so taken by the greeting, she jumped up and down in the air like a child. ‘She was moved and jumped two times to greet them,’ he said. ‘She was so touched, you can't imagine.’
