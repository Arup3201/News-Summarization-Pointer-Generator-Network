Police say an 86-year-old man shot his grandson in the head and then killed the grandson's girlfriend before fatally shooting himself in New York City.

Authorities say Heriberto Pagan, of Brooklyn, shot his 47-year-old grandson, Micheal Feliciano, in the cheek outside of a Staten Island house in Park Hill about 6:15 p.m on Friday evening before shooting 28-year-old Claritle Christina Huerta in the head inside the house. Huerta died at a hospital.

The New York Daily News reports that Pagan 'snapped' because he felt his grandson and his girlfriend were taking advantage of his 69-year-old daughter Mildred Feliciano by living in her Staten Island home.

A judge recently approved Mildred Feliciano's request to evict her son Micheal who has multiple drug related charges. The court marshal has yet to receive the eviction notice.

Police say Pagan fled in his red Mitsubishi Galant and shot himself in the head several blocks away. He was found outside his car on Clifton Avenue.

The grandson, Micheal Feliciano, is in stable condition at Staten Island University Hospital and was able to speak with investigators said police today.

The couple's 4-month-old son was found unharmed inside the house.

The child is in the custody of the Administration for Children's Services.

Neighbors told the New York Daily News that Pagan fought with his grandson every time he visited the residence.

'It was just yelling and shouting,' said John Reina. 'Whenever they got together.'

When asked is they thought Pagan would shoot his own grandson they said they never saw such a thing coming.

'He was very quiet and always to himself,' Reina said.
