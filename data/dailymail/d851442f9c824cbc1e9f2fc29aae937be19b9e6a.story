Three U.S. Marines have been shot dead by an Afghan worker on a military base in southern Afghanistan, in a deadly 24 hours during which six American soldiers were killed in rogue attacks.

The shooting took place on Friday night in the Garmsir district of Helmand province, where three U.S. special forces soldiers were killed by an Afghan policeman and his comrades earlier in the day.

In the earlier incident, an Afghan police commander opened fire on the U.S. service members after inviting them to a  Ramadan breakfast to discuss security.

'Let me clearly say that those two incidents clearly do not reflect the overall situation here in Afghanistan,' the chief NATO force spokesman, Brigadier-General Gunter Katz, said today.

Working together: NATO troops are training and working alongside Afghan soldiers as they take increasing responsibility for the anti-insurgency campaign. Afghanistan's National Army (ANA) soldiers march during a graduation ceremony at a training center in Herat on August 9, 2012.

The attack which killed three soldiers this morning is the latest in a series of so-called green-on-blue attacks in Afghanistan. The Afghan soldiers in the picture are not related to the incident

The three Marines were shot by a base
employee who turned a gun on them, in the third rogue attack in four 
days. Foreign military sources said the man had not been wearing a 
uniform and it was unclear how he got hold of the weapon.

The gunman had been detained and a 
joint Afghan-NATO investigation team was reviewing security and looking 
into the reason for the attack.

The three men killed early Friday 
morning were all Marine Corps special operations forces and appeared to 
have been killed in a planned attack by rogue Afghan forces. NATO calls 
such incidents green on blue attacks.

The NATO force says there have been 
26 such attacks on foreign troops since January in which 34 people have 
been killed. Last year, there were 21 attacks in which 35 people were 
killed.

But a coalition spokesman said the 
killings by the Afghan worker would not be included in that tally as it 
did not involve a member of the Afghan security forces.

Green on blue shootings, in which 
Afghan police or soldiers turn their guns on their Western colleagues, 
have seriously eroded trust between the allies as NATO combat soldiers 
prepare to hand over to Afghan forces by 2014, after which most foreign 
forces will leave the country.

Deadly week: On Tuesday two gunman wearing Afghan army uniforms killed a U.S. soldier in the Paktia province. Four Americans died on Wednesday in a suicide bombing attack in the Kunar province. Early Friday morning an Afghan police commander killed three U.S. Marines in Helmand Province and on Friday night an Afghan worker killed three U.S. Marines in the Garmsir district of Helmand province

Last year, a U.S. Army team led by a behavioral scientist produced a 70-page survey that revealed both Afghan and American soldiers hold disturbingly negative perceptions of the other.

According to the survey, many Afghan security personnel found U.S. troops 'extremely arrogant, bullying and unwilling to listen to their advice' and sometimes lacking concern about Afghans' safety in combat. They accused the Americans of ignoring female privacy and using denigrating names for Afghans.

American troops, in turn, often accused Afghan troops and police of 'pervasive illicit drug use, massive thievery, personal instability, dishonesty, no integrity,' the survey, which has been downplayed by U.S. military officials, said.

Katz said yesterday's incidents were 
relatively isolated and were not hurting cooperation between foreign 
forces and the 350,000-strong Afghan Security Forces.

'We have almost 500,000 police and 
soldiers working together, side by side, enhancing their trust and 
enhancing their cooperation in order together to fight for a better 
future for this country,' he said.

NATO has directed its forces to 
increase measures against rogue attacks, including placing armed 
'guardian angel' soldiers on duty in areas where troops gather, such as 
gyms and meal halls. Soldiers are also required to travel in pairs in 
Afghan base areas and carry weapons at all times.

The majority of rogue shootings, Katz
said, were due to personal disagreements between Afghan forces and 
their Western mentors, or were due to combat stress, rather than 
successful infiltration of the security forces by insurgents.

The Afghan military has also placed 
intelligence agents within Afghan units to watch for signs of rogue 
attacks, with dozens of Afghan police or soldiers moved to other bases 
following disagreements with foreign soldiers.

'Together with our Afghan partners we look into procedures, how to mitigate these incidents,' Katz said.

Last month, an Afghan policeman 
opened fire on British soldiers in Helmand province, killing three in an
attack claimed by the Taliban, and a gunman in uniform killed foreign 
trainers working for NATO in western Herat province, killing three.

A Taliban statement posted on Twitter
said the attacks were 'clearly summing up mood of Afghan nation towards
foreign occupation'.

Violence in Afghanistan is at its 
fiercest since U.S.-led Afghan troops overthrew the Taliban government 
in 2001. Insurgents have extended their reach from traditional 
strongholds in southern and eastern areas to parts of the country once 
considered safe.

This
week in Afghanistan has been particularly violent  with eight 
Americans, including one civilian, killed in three separate attacks.

On Tuesday, two gunmen wearing Afghan army uniforms killed a U.S. soldier and wounded two others in Paktia province in the east.

Suicide
bombers killed three members of a Nato patrol and an American working 
for the State Department's ASAID programme in the Kunar province in 
eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday.

On
Thursday two Afghan soldiers tried to gun down a group of NATO troops 
outside a military base in eastern Afghanistan.One of the attackers was 
killed as NATO forces shot back.

Friday
morning in Helmand province, an Afghan police commander lured three 
U.S. special forces to their death by inviting them to dinner. He then 
opened fire killing three and injuring one.

The Taliban say the shooter fled and joined their forces.

In
another incident, NATO said a coalition service member died after an 
insurgent attack in southern Afghanistan. The death brings to 19 the 
number of coalition troops killed in Afghanistan this month.Also in Helmand province Friday, six Afghan civilians were killed when their car hit a roadside bomb.

Friday night, three U.S. Marines killed by Afghan worker on military base in Helmand province.

At least six civilians were killed on Friday in Helmand when a roadside bomb blew up their vehicle.

The two deadly attacks on Friday came 
at the end of a week of violence; on Tuesday, two gunmen wearing Afghan 
army uniforms killed a U.S. soldier and wounded two others in Paktia 
province in the east.

The 
Taliban took responsibility for the attack. The gunmen escaped after the
shooting and a search is underway to track them down.

On Wednesday, suicide bombers killed 
three members of a Nato patrol and an American working for the State 
Department's ASAID programme in eastern Afghanistan.

The Taliban has claimed responsibility
for the bombing which happened in Kunar province, an eastern stronghold
of the insurgency that lies along the volatile border with Pakistan 
where militants have hideouts.

Two attackers wearing suicide vests 
detonated their explosives as a Nato foot patrol passed by the 
headquarters of the provincial government.

The
U.S. government identified the four Americans killed earlier in the 
week. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's statement said USAID 
foreign service officer Ragaei Abdelfattah, three coalition service 
members and an Afghan civilian were killed. A State Department diplomat 
was injured.

The Defense 
Department identified the three troops killed in Kunar as Air Force Maj.
Walter D. Gray, of Conyers, Ga.; Army Maj. Thomas E. Kennedy, of West 
Point, N.Y.; and Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin J. Griffin, of Laramie, Wyo.

And
on Thursday, two Afghan soldiers tried to gun down a group of NATO 
troops outside a military base in eastern Afghanistan. No international 
forces were killed, but one of the attackers was killed as NATO forces 
shot back.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the Taliban released a sickening video showing an Afghan soldier who killed a U.S. soldier and injured two others being welcomed back into the insurgent encampment.

On May 11 the soldier – who the Taliban named as Mamood – turned on his American trainers and opened fire.

First Lt Alejo Thompson, a father of two young children, was killed in the ambush in eastern Afghanistan.

The disturbing video shows the soldier being hailed as a hero. Elders embrace him and adorn him with necklaces strung with flowers. They congratulate him on his deed as he smiles for the camera.
