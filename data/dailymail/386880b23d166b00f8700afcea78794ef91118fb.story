A New Zealand man who was shot dead during a siege that lasted four hours, made a final plea before he was sprayed with bullets by police.

Armed with a gun, Shaun Emma Kumeroa, 42, locked himself inside a parked car in the carport of a block of units in Inala, in Brisbane's south west, at around noon on Monday.

Television choppers caught the dramatic and grisly moments the father was shot and killed during the stand off, with all the action captured live online.

A neighbour who witnessed the siege take place told the Courier Mail he was actually close enough to talk to the distressed man.

'I said, ‘Don’t do it, mate, don’t do it’,' he said. 'He wasn’t erratic, he was basically sitting there looking straight ahead.'

It's believed Mr Kumeroa also made a plea asking to see his daughter.

A New Zealand based family member told the Courier Mail Mr Kumeroa was a nice guy but had some personal issues and struggles. 

Mr Kumeroa's facebook page indicated he got engaged in March 2012 but it's believed he is now separated, with a young daughter. 

It was reported the New Zealander was sacked from his job on an oil rig in 2008, regarding a drunken incident and has struggled ever since, including financially 

During the siege, police tried to negotiate with him for several hours, hoping for a 'peaceful outcome', but the incident which unfolded at around 4pm that afternoon, took a turn for the worst.

Reports are he was threatening police before he suddenly jumped from his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers as he charged at them.

Instantly police reacted, firing their weapons, and Mr Kumeroa is then sprayed with bullets and is seen slumping to the ground.

Live footage then shows the police, who are fully decked out in protection gear, rush towards him, drag him from beside the vehicle and handcuff him.

Aerial news footage then showed the riot police gathering around the man on a stretcher in the car park of the apartment complex.  

The Queensland police union say officers had no choice but to shoot a gunman after the lengthy stand-off.

Reports that he'd pointed his weapon at officers are expected to form part of an investigation by the ethical standards command and a report is also being prepared for the coroner.

Union president Ian Leavers said the officers appeared to have no choice and were acting in self defence.

'That is the difficult and dangerous nature of police work. Things happen so quickly. You have to make instantaneous decisions, there are no other options,' he told ABC radio.

He said the officers involved would be having a difficult time, and the union would support them, including through the investigation.

'I can say when you've used force, and things have changed dramatically, you never get over it. You have to learn to live with it and it is not easy.'

Mr Leavers said the officers involved would receive ongoing counselling and legal support.

'These events, regardless of what the outcome is, are very traumatic for everyone involved,' he told AAP.

Paramedics are called to assist the gunman who is shot several times by police after jumping out of the vehicle he was in pointing a weapon at officers. But he is pronounced dead

He said he didn't want to comment on assertions from criminal lawyer Bill Potts that police had been provoked into engaging in 'suicide by cops'.

'It's too hard for me to comment on that issue ... it is what it is, and that will be determined by the coroner,' said Mr Leavers.

'I have full confidence in the police.' 

The Courier Mail reported police were called to a 'drug deal gone wrong', but police have not confirmed why they were called to the area, saying it was for an unrelated matter.

A black armoured vehicle had been parked directly in front of the car with the man inside, while armed SERT officers monitored the situation and tried to talk him down. 

Brisbane regional duty officer, Inspector Richard Kroon, confirmed that police had been conducting an investigation at the units when they began speaking to the man. 

'At about 3,45 further interactions had occurred and as a result of that a number of shots were fired and a 42-year-old man was subsequently pronounced deceased,' Insp. Kroon said.

'The matter is being investigated by the Police Ethical Standards Command and they will be preparing a report for the state coroner.'

NSW police media reported of the siege: 'they've sent in the big guns'

A home in Inala in Brisbane's south west, was surrounded by armed officers where a man armed with a gun hid in a parked car

A resident from the Gannet St apartment block told the Courier Mail he was working on his car when he saw police arrive.

'Four policemen got out, went in, went around to where the car was sitting,' he said.

'They saw a gun and said ‘gun, gun, gun, drop the gun, drop the gun, drop the gun’.'  

Earlier in the day, Insp. Kroon said: 'There's no real threat. I don't believe he is a resident, and no one has been evacuated.

'They are speaking to him by phone that was given to him by police and police will take as long as it takes to negotiate a peaceful outcome.

'The best outcome is that the man comes out the vehicle, unarmed, and surrenders.' 

A police media spokesman also added: 'Officers are behind him, he's not going anywhere.'

'The man was being investigated for something, he came to the attention of police who found him in a car with a gun, he pointed it at them so they’ve sent in the big guns, a negotiator and the heavy duty cops in black,' he said.

Shortly after midday, police made an emergency declaration under the Public Safety Preservation Act, asking people to avoid the area.

It was in effect for the area bounded by Comorant, Clipper, Brolga, Parakeet, Patridge, Wirraway, Kittyhawk and Inala Avenue.

'The roads are blocked off, it’s still a stand off, he’s not making any demands at the moment, police are asking people to stay away from the area,' said the police media spokesman said at the time.'

'There's no chance of harm to the public.'
