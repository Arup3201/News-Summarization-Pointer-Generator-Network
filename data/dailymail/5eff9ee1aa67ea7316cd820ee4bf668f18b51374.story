Madeleine McCann’s parents are to apply under Portuguese law to become private ‘prosecutors’ in the reopened criminal inquiry into her disappearance.

If Kate and Gerry McCann are granted the status of ‘assistentes’, their legal team could work alongside state prosecutors so they are kept informed of all new developments and conduct their own  private prosecution – running parallel to the state prosecution – against any future suspects.

It’s a distant cry from the days in 2007 when Portuguese police labelled the couple  with ‘arguido’  – or suspect –  status.

Under the country’s legal system, ‘there is a place for the victims that want to be side by side with the prosecutors’, said the McCanns’ Portuguese lawyer, Rogerio Alves. ‘They can press their own charges.’

Hopeful: Gerry and Kate McCann's fight for justice after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine is fuelled by the hope that she is alive, their Portuguese lawyer claims

Portugal’s Attorney General confirmed
 on Thursday that the probe was being reopened at the request of police 
based in Porto who have spent the last two and a half years reviewing 
the case.

The McCanns’ 
Portuguese lawyer, Rogerio Alves, said local police have finally 
admitted to the couple they no longer regard them as suspects, more than
 five years after the original investigation was shelved.

The couple were told in a police briefing last week in Lisbon, new lines of inquiry which have led to the reopening of the investigation in Portugal, absolve them of any responsibility.

Mr Alves said: 'The McCanns were already informed about the reopening of the inquiry and the reasons why it was being reopened.

'They also know that this new line of inquiry excludes any responsibility of the parents.

'The Portuguese police told them this at a meeting in Lisbon last week at which British police were also present.

'What it means is that the police understand there are new avenues that should be explored.

'This brings Madeleine’s parents a legitimate expectation not only that the truth will be discovered but also that it will be possible to find Madeleine alive which is the sole aim of all the efforts they’ve been making.'

Portugal’s current Attorney General, Joana Marques Vidal, is the first woman ever appointed to the post.

She took over as the country’s top legal advisor in October 2012 from predecessor Fernando Pinto Monteiro after his six-year mandate came to an end.

It was still unclear last night which police force would be appointed to lead the reopened inquiry. 

Initial reports suggested it would be a team of Algarve-based Policia Judiciaria detectives but today it appeared more likely the review team from Porto would be asked to do the job.

The detectives will work under the direction of public prosecutors based in the Algarve resort of Portimao.

Jose Magalhaes e Menezes, the public prosecutor in charge of the original investigation, is expected to oversee the reopened inquiry.

He was damning of the original probe pointing the finger at Madeleine’s parents and claimed officers under disgraced Goncalo Amaral achieved 'very little' during their 15-month investigation.

He also thwarted attempts by Mr Amaral to charge the McCanns with child abandonment, leading to a souring in relations between police and prosecutors.

Mr Amaral went on to write a controversial book called ‘The Truth of the Lie’ which the McCanns are currently suing him over at an ongoing civil trial in a Lisbon court because of his claims they faked their daughter’s abduction to cover up her death in their holiday apartment.

It also emerged last night Madeleine’s parents are set to apply to become private prosecutors - ‘assistentes’ under Portuguese law - in the reopened criminal inquiry.

It will mean their legal team can work alongside state prosecutors so they are kept informed of all new developments and conduct their own private prosecution - running parallel to the state prosecution - against any future suspects charged over Madeleine’s disappearance.

Can press their own charges: The McCanns (pictured in 2007 after Maddie's disappearance) will be able to be in court with their lawyer if they are granted prosecutor status once the secrecy order is lifted

It marks a remarkable turnaround in a case in which they were once 'arguidos' or suspects. 

Their status as ‘assistentes’ would be crucial because of the secrecy order slapped on the case by Portugal’s Attorney General.

They wouldn’t have access to all case files at present because of the secrecy order as ‘assistentes’ - but would once the secrecy order is lifted. 

Mr Alves said today: 'I will be applying for the McCanns to become assistentes in this case but don’t know yet when.

'Madeleine is the victim as well as her parents who are also her legal representatives.

'According to Portuguese criminal procedural law there is a place for the victims that want to be side by side with the prosecutors.

'It’s a question of them helping the prosecutor deliver to the case files all the information they have that can assist the investigation.

'They can submit an accusation, they can press their own charges.

'At the trial, if there is a trial, they can be in court with their own lawyer, asking their own questions.

'It’s a sort of a private accusation to help the state prosecution.”

He added: 'The secrecy order that’s been placed on this case prevents me from saying what the new lines of inquiry are.

'The police asked us specifically not to compromise the investigation and we are all obliged to respect the secrecy order.

'It would be a crime for anyone working within the file with full information on the details to talk about it. We don’t have the full details, we just have an idea.

'Madeleine’s parents are the ones with most interest in abiding by the secrecy order and maintaining the efficiency of the investigation. But I can say that the information they got from the Portuguse police directly is that the new lines of investigation absolve them of any responsibility in their daughter’s disappearance.'
