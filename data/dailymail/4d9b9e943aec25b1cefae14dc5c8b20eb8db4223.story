This year saw her open her first standalone store and watch her celebrity fanbase sky-rocket, so it comes as little surprise that fashion designer Victoria Beckham's self-eponymous label has been shortlisted for Brand of the Year 2014.

The mother-of-four will compete with fashion powerhouse Alexander McQueen, a label loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, as well as her friend Stella McCartney for the prestigious title. 

The winner will be announced at the glitzy British Fashion Awards event on December 1.

This year’s British Fashion Awards will be hosted by British comedian, actor, author and television presenter, Jack Whitehall, at the London Coliseum. 

The nominees and winners are voted for by members of the global fashion industry and this isn't the first time Victoria has been nominated. In fact, she won Designer Brand of the Year back in 2011.

It's been a good year in the world of fashion for Mrs Beckham. The 40-year-old designer opened her Dover Street store in London's Mayfair last month and hundreds of fashion fans flocked to the site to check it out.

The luxury boutique - Victoria’s first foray into retail - has eschewed convention, embracing instead a minimalist look, with no cash registers, no display window and no rails.  

Speaking to MailOnline about the unique space shortly before its opening, Victoria said: 'It’s the first time people can see the brand through my eyes.

‘I didn’t want a traditional shop window, just a plain window, and a huge concrete sliding door.

‘The floors weren't connected, and I said, “Wouldn’t it be incredible to drill a hole through all three floors, so you could stand on the top floor and see the ground floor.”'

She added: ‘I didn’t think it would be possible, but it was.’

Victoria's store is not for those on a shoe-string budget with the cheapest items coming in at £150 for a keyring. And Victoria wanted the rest of her store to reflect the aspirational feel of her clothing line. 

She continued: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere,’ Victoria explained. ‘Payment is with an iPad, so we can go to the customer on whatever floor she’s on.’ 

Success story: Shoppers queue outside the Victoria Beckham store shortly before its launch last month
