An anti-drink driving group  put out a glowing report of Uber after receiving a sizable donation from the taxi app, it has been revealed.

Last week Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Uber jointly published the study which suggested the ride-sharing service had helped reduce the number of drink-driving accidents.

The press release stated that Uber can be 'a powerful tool in the fight to reduce the number of drunk-driving crashes' and  found ridesharing is having a 'significant impact' on drink driving across America’s cities.

Meanwhile, it has since been revealed that Uber started donating money to MADD last summer.

Last year Uber and MADD announced a partnership in which the app would donate $1 for every ride taken and $10 for every new customer who used the service in a 24-hour period around the 4th of July, as long as customers used a promo code, UberMADD.

Last weekend, Uber ran a similar deal on Super Bowl Sunday, where the service donated $1 for every passenger between 3pm and midnight who used the code ThinkandRide.

Amy George, senior vice president of marketing and communications at MADD, said they were not backing away from the report

It is not yet clear how much money has been passed to MADD. 

After the report came under scrutiny, Amy George, senior vice president of marketing and communications at MADD, said that the figures in the report - that appeared to show a drop in drink driving in cities where Uber was used - was purely correlational.

'Nobody is saying that there is a causation relationship here,' she told Pro Publica.

Ms George denied distancing herself from the study and said the anti drink-driving organisation would continue to back its findings.

'MADD strongly stands behind the report and that Uber is a powerful tool to reduce drunk driving,' she told Valley Wag. 'We have consistently said the data is correlative, and those correlations are valid at showing that Uber is having an impact.' 

In the report, Uber claimed that 'when empowered with more transportation options, people are making safer, better choices that are helping save lives.'

Among the findings, the research found that drunk-driving crashes in California fell by 6.5 per cent among drivers under 30 in the markets where Uber operates - an estimated total of 1,800 crashes prevented since July 2012.

With California the app's home state, the company claims that the drop demonstrates for a possible similar reduction in other Uber markets.
