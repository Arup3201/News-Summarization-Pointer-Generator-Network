It was the shocking discovery that tore two families apart and forever changed the security procedures of U.S. hospitals.

Now, 18 years later, America's most widely-reported case of two children who were switched at birth continues to remain relevant - and one of the girls has given a rare interview about how it has affected her as an adult.

Callie Johnson was just three-years-old when single mother Paula Johnson discovered the toddler was not biologically hers.

Her biological parents were Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers, and the daughter they took home and raised, Rebecca, was actually Paula's birth child.

Now: Callie Johnson is 18 and has given her first interview about being switched at birth. She has spoken about the love and gratitude she has for her mother Paula, who discovered her daughter was not actually hers when Callie was three

Then: This picture of Callie (left) and Paula Johnson (right) was taken around the same time in 1998 that Paula discovered the little girl she had been raising for three years was not actually her own

The biological parents: Kevin Rogers (left) and Whitney Chittum (right) were 18 and 16 respectively when they had their first child in 1995. While they took home Rebecca, (bottom left) their biological daughter was actually Callie

But in a tragic twist of fate, Kevin and Whitney, along with four other relatives, died in a shocking car crash the same day the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville discovered they had switched the children shortly after their birth in June 1995.

It meant the couple died without knowing the mistake that had been made and that Rebecca would grow up without her 'parents'.

Today Callie is 18, living on her own in Richmond, Virginia and is planning on going to culinary school, but 'adoptive' mom Paula who raised her remains the single biggest person in her life.

'The big question everyone always asks me is 'Would you prefer your parents still be alive or passed?' she said in an interview this week with CBS 6.

Devastating: In a horrible coincidence, Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers died in a shocking car crash the day it was discovered their child had been switched at birth and they never found out the truth. The car they were traveling in collided with a truck during wet weather on Interstate 81 near Roanoke in North Carolina

Pressure: The University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville came under intense scrutiny after it was made public at a press conference in 1998 they had accidentally switched two babies in the maternity ward three years earlier

'I don’t know what I’m missing so in a sense, I do feel more sorry for Rebecca, because she doesn’t know her biological mom.'

National headlines: The story was major news, even partially eclipsing the Monica Lewinsky affair, which happened around the same time

Paula said she 'does not have a relationship' with Rebecca following years of trying to get custody of her as a child.

Conversely, Paula is more than just a mom to Callie.

'She's my best friend,' Callie said.

'She always has been.

'And I can honestly say that.'

Paula said she and her daughter have been incredibly open about the truth and how she isn't Callie's biological mother.

'I've always taught her from day one they are her parents,' Paula said.

'She was born in Whitney's belly and she was born in my heart'.

It is Paula's journey through the ordeal that was arguably the most turbulent.

She found out the truth first after her boyfriend asked for a paternity test to see if he were Callie's father.

The test was negative for both him and her. Neither of the them were Callie's biological parent.

She then reported it to the Virginia hospital, who pieced together what had happened.

Struggle: After finding out the truth, Paula Johnson (left) began a long and arduous custody battle to claim her biological daughter, Rebecca Chittum, following the death of Rebecca's parents

The hospital pored over records. Only one baby girl born in the same short window as Callie that July had the right blood type. The Chittum and Rogers family found out the truth two weeks after Kevin and Whitney's funeral following a blood test of Rebecca.

Paula even remembered bumping into Whitney in the hall when both were in labor.

After learning that Kevin and Whitney died, Paula tried to claim her biological child and sued for custody of Rebecca in 1999.

However Kevin and Whitney's parents, the grandparents as Rebecca knew them, fought just as hard to keep her.

Following a bitter three-year battle both in and out of court, a judge ruled the girls would stay with the families who had raised until they were old enough to make their own decisions.

A visitation schedule was put into play, but both girls quickly grew tired of the long trips to see biological family members they hardly knew.

Paula also sued the University of Virginia Center for their mistake, hoping for a damages payout of $31 million.

Happy family: Paula Johnson and daughter Callie share a giggle inside Callie's home in Richmond, Virginia

Not-so-happy: Paula Johnson says she has never been able to let go of the hate she feels from her ordeal and the fact she has no relationship with her biological daughter

However she settled for just $1.25 million.

Paula said her anger at the situation has never really subsided.

'I’m angry because I don’t have a relationship with my biological child,' she said this week.

'I’m angry that Kevin and Whitney aren’t here to see what a beautiful child she is and how much she’s grown.

'I’m angry at the hospital because the only thing I ever asked was them to apologize.'

Callie is planning to write a tell-all about the 'Switched at Birth' saga.
