An elderly couple today told of the terrifying moment masked robbers broke into their home and threatened to cut off their hands if they didn't hand over their cash and jewellery.

Harry Carrick, 78 and Sylvia Everett, 75, were enjoying a quiet night in with the television and a crossword when three men wearing balaclavas burst into their home in Cleadon, South Tyneside, just after 6pm on Saturday night.

The masked men rammed pillowcases over their heads before binding their arms and pushing them to the floor.

Horrific injuries: The severe bruising sustained by Harry Carrick, 78, after he and his partner Sylvia Everett, 75, were tied up by masked robbers who burst into their home in Cleadon, South Tyneside, on Saturday

They then ransacked the house - stealing £25,000 worth of jewellery and cash during the hour-long ordeal.

Frail Mr Carrick, who suffers from asthma and had only been out of hospital two days after undergoing treatment for a serious chest infection, suffered painful bruising in the attack.

The great-grandparents have today spoken out in the hope people will come forward with information as detectives continue to hunt for the culprits.

Mrs Everett, who used to own a post office in Nottingham before selling up in the early 90s, said: 'I was sitting doing the crossword and Harry was eating some ginger snaps with his coffee and watching television when these three thugs with balaclavas and pillowcases in their hands came running in the house. I thought it was some kind of joke.

'They shouted at me to "shut my mouth" and used the most foul language.

'They yanked the jewellery off my neck. I pleaded for them to at least leave my locket that I've worn for 20 years, but they shouted at me to shut up or they would "kick my head in".

'They shoved the pillowcases over our heads and tied my hands and feet, it was really tight and cutting into my wrists.

'He said they knew we had a safe and wanted to know where it was. Then they told Harry if he didn't get the key to the safe they'd cut my fingers off.

'Initially we said we didn't have one but Harry said "Sylvia, just give them the key".

'They then used a crowbar to get access to the safe which had money in from when I sold my post office.'

The couple were then told to stay in the corridor, as two of the men left to search the property while one stayed behind - threatening to slice off Mrs Everett's ears if they made a sound.

Mrs Everett continued: 'They kept us there for about an hour while they went through the whole house. At one point I could hear the sound of a bag being unzipped. I thought they were going to put our bodies in it. I thought we were going to die.'

The raiders also ransacked the couple's bedroom - taking about £25,000 worth of jewellery - and a quantity of cash the couple had put aside to buy a new car.

Mr Carrick, a retired railways worker, added: 'I had to tell them where the safe was, they said they were going to cut her fingers off and I believe they would have done.

'I feel like moving away from here, but Sylvia loves this bungalow and I'm not going to let them get the better of me.'

When the robbers finally fled, Mr Carrick was able to wriggle his hands free and the couple dialled 999.

The police were on the scene within minutes and used police dogs to try to catch the men's trail.

The couple, who met on a cruise after the deaths of their previous spouses, moved into the street 20 years ago, where houses sell for up to three quarters of a million pounds.

Within weeks they had been targeted by thieves, who used glass-cutting equipment to remove a section of a window and sneak in without the couple realising, taking almost all of Ms Everett's jewellery and family heirlooms.

They were also broken into at the end of November last year, but were out at the time and believe the alarm caused the thieves to flee empty-handed.

Mrs Everett said: 'This is the fifth time we've been burgled. I don't understand why this keeps on happening to us.

'It's horrific what we've been through, I am totally in shock. I don't swear, but they are absolute scum.

'What kind of person threatens to cut someone's ears and fingers off? I felt like saying to them "would you like someone doing this to your mother?"'

A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'At 7.40pm on Saturday police received a report of a burglary at a home in Cleadon Village.

'An elderly couple had been tied up and threatened during the burglary when three men forced their way into the couple's home. The couple were checked over by paramedics but did not require hospital treatment.

'A large amount of cash and jewellery was taken and a police investigation is under way to trace the offenders.'

Acting Inspector Nick Gjorven of Northumbria Police South Tyneside Area Command added: 'This was a distressing incident for the occupants and we're carrying out inquiries to find those responsible.

'We have a number of officers on patrol in the local area to reassure residents and if anyone has any information I'd urge them to contact us.'
