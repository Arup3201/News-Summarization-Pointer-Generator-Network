Rugby ace Mike Tindall's appeal against a £25,000 RFU fine has been successful, it has been reported

Shamed rugby star Mike Tindall was reinstated to the England rugby squad because he can't remember his raucous World Cup drinking session, it emerged today.

The husband of the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, went on a drunken night out in New Zealand after England's disappointing World Cup opener against Argentina in September.

But after being dropped form the Elite Playing Squad, England bosses made a dramatic U-turn in admitting Tindall's memory loss was a 'mitigating factor' in reinstating him.

RFU chiefs have also cut Tindall's fine from £25,000 to £15,000 after the 33-year-old appealed.

Explaining the decision, RFU chief executive Martyn Thomas said: ‘Mike did not intentionally mislead the RFU team management when he stated that he could not remember where he was on the night of September 11, and that he was relying on other people’s versions of events which were relayed to him.'

Newly-wed Tindall downed cut-price shots at a ‘dwarf-tossing’ competition with fellow players and cavorted with a glamorous former girlfriend.

Afterwards Rob Andrew, director of the Rugby Football Union elite squad, warned that his behaviour would ‘not be tolerated’ and he was thrown off the team, effectively ending his international career.

But yesterday, the player won his appeal against the decision and was allowed back on to the elite squad.

In his appeal, Tindall claimed that there were no protocols on the night in question, including no ban on alcohol or curfew.

The Rugby Players’ Association backed the 33-year-old and described the punishment  as ‘extraordinary’ and ‘unprecedented’.

His reinstatement is largely symbolic because the squad disbands at the end of the year ready for a new one to be announced for 2012. However, he could now potentially be selected for future international matches.

Tindall, who married world champion eventer Zara Phillips in July, had heaped embarrassment on his bride after he was seen embracing the woman later revealed as his ex-girlfriend  Jessica Palmer.

At the time of his punishment, Tindall’s father Phil insisted he had been made a ‘scapegoat’ because of his connection to the Royal Family. But the RFU accused Tindall of breaching the England elite player squad agreement.

Mr Andrew was even more scathing. ‘Mike Tindall’s actions reached a level of misconduct that was unacceptable in a senior England player,’ he said.

RFU chief executive Martyn Thomas added: ‘There was no evidence of any suggestion of sexual impropriety of any nature with the woman in question, and we accept the fact that she is a family friend who he has known for a long time.

‘Mike expressed deep regret during the appeal meeting about his behaviour, and that he had apologised to [then England manager] Martin Johnson and the team for the events which unfolded as a consequence.’

However, he added that  Tindall’s behaviour ‘fell way below that to be expected of somebody of his calibre and experience’.

The Gloucester player had, he said, ‘exposed himself to a very compromising position and exposed the rest of the team to damaging publicity’.
