Once the choice was between a quick espresso or soothing chai latte, hot chocolate or cool frappuccino.

But now you can add a glass of shiraz and a bottle of beer to your Starbucks order.

US coffee giant Starbucks is now making in-roads into restaurant territory with its latest venture, Starbucks Evenings.

The chain, which has more than 700 outlets in the UK, is offering a range of hot and cold meals as well as wines and beers to customers to be served from 4pm.

The newly renovated Stansted Airport in Essex is the first UK location to offer the evening menu with plans to expand the programme to additional stores. 

Starbucks UK is launching an evening menu offering ten types of wine plus hot and cold small plates

The wine list has ten bottles on offer; one sparkling, one rose, four whites and four reds. There is also Peroni Nastro Azzuro and Magners Original Cider on offer. 

The food menu has five vegetarian options including vegetable crudites, stone-baked flatbreads and truffle mac and cheese. There is also a cheeseboard featuring Somerset Brie, Cheddar, and Blue Stilton. 

For meat-eaters there is  chorizo and prawn skewers with chilli ketchup, braised British beef or pulled pork with chilli. 

There is currently only one dessert option, a warm chocolate brownie with chocolate and caramel sauce topped with whipped cream

Ian Cranna, vice president of marketing  for Starbucks EMEA said: 'We are delighted to launch the first Evenings Programme in the UK.

'Providing a welcoming coffeehouse environment has always been our focus and now we can offer something new for the evening too. 

'I think our customers will love the new range of terrific food and carefully selected wines and beers which will provide even more choice and reasons to visit us later in the day.'

Simon Smith, CEO, UK and Ireland for SSP UK, commented: 'We are delighted to support our partner Starbucks with the new Evenings Programme at Stansted Airport. 

'Starbucks is a brand which is synonymous with great coffee and introducing this programme will tempt our coffee lovers to experience a new range of delicious foods and carefully selected alcoholic beverages in our newly renovated store.'

However, its move into the UK alcohol market was criticised by charities last night who expressed concern that such a large firm is licensing some premises.

Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘We hope Starbucks will take their responsibility as an alcohol retailer very seriously by ensuring the training of staff and under-age checks are adequate, and that responsible drinking is encouraged. 

'It’s a bit disappointing to see another establishment now selling booze which will limit those customers who are in recovery or just wanting an alcohol-free environment.’ 

There are currently no plans to offer spirits as part of Starbucks Evenings Programme. 

Regular Starbucks food and drink favourites will continue to be made available throughout the evening. All wine and beer will be served for in-store consumption only.

In US stores, Starbucks Evenings has proven very popular and has rolled out to 30 locations in Seattle, Portland, Southern California, Chicago and Atlanta. 

Victoria Gould, retail expert at Jones Lang LaSalle, predicted that Starbucks will roll out the evenings programme in tourist hotspots to widen the company’s appeal.

She said: ‘Starbucks are aiming to elongate their trading day. Where better to trial this in the UK than at an airport? Airports have some of the longest trading hours but also a captive audience that wants to eat and drink as a priority.’

The company has yet to reveal prices for each item.
