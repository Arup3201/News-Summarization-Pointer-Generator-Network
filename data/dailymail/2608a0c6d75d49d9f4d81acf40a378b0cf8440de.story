They may have a reputation for committing suicide, but it appears that lemmings actually have a powerful survival mechanism.

Biologists have found that the furry Scandinavian rodents use their multicoloured fur and emit loud screams to scare away predators.

They say that the rodents employ a form of aposematism - the use of colours and other signals to warn that an animal is toxic or dangerous.

However, in the case of Norwegian lemmings, they back up the message from their yellow, brown and white fur and loud barking calls with some aggressive biting.

The lemming, a small arctic rodent, has become synonymous with self-destructive behaviour, due to its alleged propensity to throw itself off cliffs by following the herd.

While it is true that lemmings migrate in large numbers, and these migrations might, in theory, lead to riverbanks, they are in fact good swimmers.

The myth is said to have arisen thanks to a 1958 Disney nature documentary called White Wilderness, which appeared to show suicidal lemmings leaping into a river.

This idea was then not helped by the popularity of a 1991 computer game that required players to rescue the tiny creatures as they plodded to their death.

There is in fact no scientific evidence that these animals commit suicide.

Unlike other rodents, the creatures are known to fight back against attackers with loud screams, lunges and biting with their sharp teeth.

Indeed there is anecdotal evidence of Norwegian lemmings taking on animals that are much larger than them, including cats, birds of prey and even large dogs like bull mastifs.

Professor Malte Andersson, a biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who conducted the research, said the lemmings appear to use its distinctive colours and aggressive behaviour to ensure predators can tell it apart from other rodents such as voles.

He said: 'Distinctive, contrast-rich colouration, anti-predator calls and threat postures of the Norwegian lemming form a multimodal suit of posematic traits, warning predators that this is a more dangerous prey than the smaller sympatric voles.

'The traits immediately announce species identity - powerful lemming, not weaker vole - and may therefore increase the chances of surviving encounters with predators.'

In the study, which is published in the journal Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology, Professor Andersson compared the behaviour of the colourful Norwegian lemmings with the dull brown Alaskan lemmings when threatened.

They found the Norwegian lemmings gave loud calls in 32 per cent of encounters with predators and most called and lunged if surprised.

However, just two per cent of the Alaskan lemmings called when confronted with a predator and most froze if surprised.

Professor Andersson found in a separate study that compared to grey voles, the Norwegian lemmings would also aggressively resist attacks by predators.

When threatened the Norwegian lemmings tended to rise up, scream and lunge at the predator, its white cheeks and chin contrasting with the black front and cap of the creature.

Professor Andersson believes the colouration may direct attention towards the lemmings main defence weapon - the sharp teeth.

This, he says, is a similar approach used by the patterns on badgers.

He added: 'Black and white or yellow is a classic aposematic colouration, avoidance of which does not require learning in some birds.

'Black and white facial colouration is often combined with sharp teeth or other weapons for example in terrestrial small carnivores.'

'Also, small juvenile lemmings use threat calls towards predators, a possible example of auto-mimicry of more powerful adults by small juveniles.'
