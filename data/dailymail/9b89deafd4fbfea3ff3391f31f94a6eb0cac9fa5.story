Not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than Jillian Tenen.

The 29-year-old events planner moved to Boston from Florida two years ago and doesn't have any family in town.

When the first of many record-breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in January, Tenen was sick with the flu, and didn't dig out her 2007 Honda Civic.

Only the snow didn't stop, and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in Bay Village.

By the time Tenen got her shovel out, it was all-but too late.  

'I'm 5' 2,' and it was all ice, an iceberg on top of my car,' Tenen told The Boston Globe.

'I couldn't reach it. I couldn't lift it. And even if I could, there was nowhere to put it. I just didn't know what to do.' 

After a few laughs, quite a lot of tears, and at lease one breakdown, Tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed.

It's under the iceberg: Jillian Tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in Boston in winter, and after failing to dig out her car, it ended up under this mountain of snow on Isabella Street in the Bay Village neighborhood

There it is: Recently, some of the 'iceberg' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear

Not again: But with this winter being Boston's snowiest ever, the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried

Bleak: Jillian Tenen's car is seen parked on Isabella Street in Boston on February 23, 2015. Winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of Boston's history

Clearing up: Jillian Tenen's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow, staying frozen in place at the same on-street parking spot

Almost there: By last week - March 12 - and after two months almost, the Honda Civic was almost ready to escape its cave

Finally!: On March 16, Jillian Tenen's was finally back on the road, seven weeks after it was first snowed in

Yay! All-smiles, Jillian Tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on March 18, and was shocked that it started right away

But after seven weeks, and a heap of chipping, the car has finally freed from its icy cave.

Sadly not much could be done about the damage.

The windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up.

There were also deep dents in the roof.

But, surprisingly, the car started on the first go after it had thawed.

Tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage.

While she hopes that future winters won't be so severe, and will plow her car diligently from now on, she learnt a valuable lesson.

'If I had to do it again, I would definitely do one thing differently,' she told The Globe.

'I would not park on the corner.' 

Although the storm didn't cripple Boston as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary residents

Damage: The weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly, but Tenen is filing an insurance claim

Many people in the northeastern US had to put on winter boots as Winter Storm Ultima hijacked the first official day of spring

The Brooklyn Bridge was coated with snow as New York City was hit with yet another snowstorm on Friday, March 20

Brooklyn residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though Friday was the first day of spring

Spring arrived on Friday, but Winter Storm Ultima ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow

Snow will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend

Winter Storm Ultima may have cause more issues for Tenen and her car on Friday. 

Although the storm didn't cripple the city as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary Boston. 

In the city, it's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after March 20, Weather.com reported. 

During the April Fools' Blizzard of 1997, 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed Boston.

On Friday, Ultima led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals

Weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman said: 'While late March surface temperatures and Ultima's quick movement won't make this a blockbuster, some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the New York City and Philadelphia metros.

The storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in Lynnport, Pennsylvania, 6.7 inches at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and six inches in Cascade, Maryland.
