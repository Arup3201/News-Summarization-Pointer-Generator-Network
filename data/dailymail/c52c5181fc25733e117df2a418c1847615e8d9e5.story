A woman was left in agony after her hot water bottle burst scalding her chest and arm.

Brenda Smith, 63, needed a skin graft and spent eight days in a specialist burns unit. She leapt into a cold bath at her home in Westcliff, Essex, until paramedics arrived.

'I was in the bath for about an hour I 
didn't want to get out it was so painful, the heat on my chest was 
unbearable,' she said.

Researchers at Anglia Ruskin University say that the numbers needing hospital treatment for hot water bottle burns has risen in the last two years.

But they say these admissions only represent a handful of the true numbers suffering injuries as most will not go to hospital.

The researchers say rising numbers of families are using 
them as a 'cost-effective' way of staying warm in the hope of saving on 
their energy bills.

Another reason for the increase is that people are buying cheap hot water bottles from abroad made from rubber that easily perishes.

Mrs Smith, 63, said: 'The hot water bottle I used was only about 14 months old.

'I will never use one again. I'd warn people to think twice about using them. Now I use a cherry stone or wheat bag for warmth.'

Mrs Smith said she took a covered hot water bottle, that she had bought at a high street store, to bed after feeling unwell.

But as she pulled it on to her chest the bottle split and hot water, poured from the kettle just half an hour earlier, emptied on her chest and down her left arm.

Mrs Smith said: 'A five to six inch split just appeared and I was covered in hot water.

'I screamed for my partner to come up, I took my cotton top off and put cold flannels on.

'We rang NHS DIrect who advised me to get in a cold bath and call for an ambulance.'

Mrs Smith had a skin graft at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford

Paramedics dressed her wound and took her to Southend Hospital where she was given morphine and from there she went to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, to be assessed.

She added: 'They thought I may not need a skin graft, but when I went back for another appointment there was one patch on my left breast that had a deep burn.

'I ended up needing a skin graft taken from my thigh. It is still painful at the movement is difficult. The graft site on my thigh is also very sore.'

Mrs Smith still has regular appointments at the St Andrew's Centre for Plastic Surgery and Burns at Broomfield Hospital.

Quentin Frew, Visiting Clinical Fellow at Anglia Ruskin, said: 'It is clear there is a need to increase awareness of the ability of hot water bottles to cause significant long-term burn injuries.

'We encourage people to look for the Kitemark safety standard when buying hot water bottles.'

The NHS does not compile figures on the numbers of patients needing treatment for hot water bottle burns.  But last year more than 1,800 were admitted to hospital following injuries caused by hot water or other hot fluids, which would include hot water bottles.
