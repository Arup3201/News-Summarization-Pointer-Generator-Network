Vladimir Putin is behaving like a 'mid 20th-century tyrant' with the illegal annexation of Crimea, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has warned.

He said the Russian President will pay a 'political and economic price' for what he is doing in the region but ruled out Britain offering arms to Ukraine.

The comments echo Prince Charles’s warning last year that ‘Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler’.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned the Russian President Vladimir Putin will pay a 'political and economic price' for what he is doing in Ukraine

With Germany and France taking the lead in the negotiations, David Cameron has been criticised for allowing Britain to become a 'foreign policy irrelevance'.

The aim is to draw up a possible joint document on implementing the much-violated September peace plan for eastern Ukraine concluded in Minsk, Belarus.

That agreement also featured a demilitarised zone, though the battle lines have since changed, and the government in Kiev has offered a measure of autonomy to the separatists.

Speaking on Sky News' Murnaghan, Mr Hammond insisted there had to be a political solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine and stressed that the proposed deal was 'one of the last opportunities Russia will have' to avoid further damage to its economy.

He dismissed Mr Hollande's remark that this is the last chance for peace as 'apocalyptic language', arguing there was already a combat situation on the ground.

But Mr Hammond added: 'This is one of the last opportunities that Russia will have to avoid yet further significant damage to its economy which is bound to happen if the intransigence of Vladimir Putin forces the rest of the world to increase and tighten the sanctions from which Russia's economy is already reeling.'

Germany has ruled out providing lethal aid to the Ukrainian forces in contrast to the US which is considering supplying arms in certain circumstances.

Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, warned against defence cuts

Cutting British defence spending could encourage further aggression by Russia, a senior Tory MP warned. 

Rory Stewart, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, said the Nato commitment to devoting at least 2 per cent of national wealth to the military was 'really key' to showing Vladimir Putin the alliance was serious over Ukraine.

'We need a manifesto commitment that lays out a long-term obligation,' he told BBC1's Sunday Politics: 'The 2 per cent is really key.

'If we look at Russia and Ukraine at the moment, Putin is testing us. He is testing our resolve; he wants to work out whether Nato is serious.

'One of the biggest indicators on that is we committed, at the Wales summit, to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence. We have encouraged lots of other countries to do the same thing.'

Chancellor George Osborne insisted Britain remained 'hugely influential in the world'.

But he refused to confirm the 2 per cent target would continue to be met after the election. 'We are currently hitting that target. I am not going to pre-judge our defence review. But people know that we care about our nation's security and defence because we have invested in the latest equipment.

'People know we have met the 2 per cent commitment and are meeting it today.' 

Mr Hammond said Britain's position was currently not to provide arms to Ukraine, adding: 'This is a national decision for each country to make.

'There is no military solution to this conflict. The Ukrainians can't beat the Russian army. That is not a practical proposition. There has to be a political solution and the Kremlin, Mr Putin, has to understand he will pay a political and economic price for what he is doing in the Ukraine.

'Britain's position is that at the moment we don't think supplying arms is the right thing to do but obviously if the situation on the ground changes we will keep that position under review.'

He refused to be drawn on the circumstances under which the UK might consider supplying arms saying he would not talk about a hypothetical situation.

Mr Hammond also said he believes the sanctions currently in place against Russia - combined with the falling oil price - are having the desired effect despite Mr Putin's public reassurances that all is well.

He said: 'Putin is toughing this out in his public presentation. You would expect him to do that. It's the kind of person he is.

'But we all know and Russians certainly know, thinking back to the days of the Soviet Union, that in the end the economic facts cannot be ignored. If your economy is cratering you cannot support the kind of foreign adventures Putin is undertaking, you cannot support the kind of security state structure that he has generated and that he needs to keep him there.

'So he will have to trim his behaviour to reflect the decline in the Russian economy and sanctions are a critical part of the pressure on him to change his behaviour.'

The current negotiations are not about the annexation of Crimea, which Mr Hammond denounced as illegal, but he insisted Russia's withdrawal from it would be the next demand if the plan for eastern Ukraine is accepted by Mr Putin.

He added: 'Don't make it sound like that is an outrageous thing for us to demand.

'This man has sent troops across an international border and occupied another country's territory in the 21st century acting like some mid-20th century tyrant.

'We do not behave like that. Civilised nations do not behave like that in the 21st century. We live in a rules-based society. We want the Russian people to be part of that international community.

'We want Russia to enjoy the kind of economic growth and rising standards of living that people in the rest of Europe enjoy and we do not see any reason to tolerate this kind of outrageous and outdated behaviour from the Kremlin.'

Mr Hammond ruled out Britain arming the Ukrainian forces under threat from Russian aggression

Downing Street insists Britain is playing an 'active role' in Europe's response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, despite the fact that Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande were spearheading the diplomatic effort to end the conflict.

General Sir Richard Shirreff, Britain's former top Nato commander, said the UK should be playing a major role in the efforts to resolve the crisis amid fears that it could lead to an all-out European war.

'The UK is a major Nato member, it is a major EU member, it is a member of the UN Security Council, and it is unfortunate that the weight that the British Prime Minister could bring to efforts to resolve this crisis appear to be absent,' he said.

Yesterday the president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, said the appeasement of Hitler in 1938, which failed to avert war, should be a ‘lesson to all of us’. He added: ‘We know from history that appeasement will never satisfy those that are being appeased.’

US Senator John McCain reportedly invoked the ghost of Munich in 1938, saying: ‘History shows us that dictators will always take more if you let them. They will not be dissuaded from their brutal behaviour when you fly to meet them.’

Tory MP Rory Stewart, chairman of the defence select committee, warned George Osborne against cutting defence spending below the Nato target of 2 per cent of GDP, claiming this would encourage further aggression by Moscow.
