An anonymous benefactor who has been leaving cash hidden throughout San Francisco has spoken out about the decision to share their wealth - as winners share their joy online.

The donor, who invites people to track down the cash through a series of clues posted on a Twitter page, @HiddenCash, also revealed that they are going to start hiding the money in other cities.

'I just closed a real estate deal where my profit was about 
half-a-million dollars,' he or she told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'I decided even before it closed that one of 
the things I wanted to do with the money was something fun in SF.'

HiddenCash said they toyed with challenges for people to earn the money, but after all the ideas seemed too complicated, they opted for the simple cash stash.

'I
 just hope some rich one-percenter like me doesn't find it and keep it,'
 HiddenCash said. 'In no way is this meant to be instead of charity. I 
also donate generously to charity.'

And other cities may also soon get their chance to battle for the cash, which is stuffed inside envelopes and hidden beneath benches or in public parks, restrooms or stairways.

'I
 have no plans to stop anytime soon,' the donor said. 'In fact, we will also drop some in 
L.A. next week (I am going there on business). Any maybe expand to more 
cities.'

But he said he wishes to stay anonymous because some people who know him might not be happy that he is giving money away.

HiddenCash has so far made cash dumps around San Francisco's Mission District and through the Richmond District, among others.

Amounts at
 the drop spots have varied. @HiddenCash has shared uploads of multiple 
$20 bills being tucked away for curious scavengers, as well as $50 and 
$100 amounts.

The tweeter, 
who calls the program 'an anonymous social experiment for good,' leaves 
hints by sharing a photo of the drop-off spot, as well as written clue.

'Could
 you and 25 of your friends use a @Sightglass Coffee? Look in the 
abandoned phonebox next door,' one tweet said, along with a photo of a 
$100 bill.

'New drop: look under me :)' said another, which appeared to show a park bench.

The Twitter accounts followers have now reached more than 20,000 as residents desperately try to get their hands on the cash.

And the lucky ones have been tweeting pictures of their newfound riches.

'YESSSSSS,' wrote one winner, who found the cash on Ocean Beach. 'Had to race another searcher but I WON.'

The donor also contacted The Bold Italic and said he or she will leave money 'once or twice a week'.

'This
 is my way of giving back to the community and also having fun,' they 
said. 'The bigger idea is just to give back, both financially and a 
sense of fun to the community that has made me wealthy.'
