CCTV cameras have caught the moment a son apparently drags a suitcase containing the dismembered remains of his mother into the street for rubbish collectors to pick up.

Two hours after Carlos Macchione de Sampaio, 39, dumped the suitcase in the street in Santos, São Paulo, a vagrant looking for valuables opened it and found the body of retired teacher Claudia Macchione, 74.

Macchione has been arrested, suspected of killing his mother.

The incident occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning, October 26. Cameras in the building show a bulky shirtless man in shorts, heaving a suitcase into the lift a few minutes before 11pm. Moments later he lugs the case out of the front door depositing it on the pavement for refuse trucks to collect in the morning.

The man does not appear to be concerned about a resident entering the building as he carries on regardless.

According to police, Sampaio, who had been living with his mother, suffered from psychological problems and was known to be violent after having a drink.

He worked as an English translator after living in Canada with his mother, some years ago. Press reports claim Sampaio was involved in a serious car accident while abroad, which left him with head injuries, affecting his mental state.

Nephew of the murdered woman, Fernando Casali, said his cousin used to live some 300 miles away in the state of São Paulo.

‘Carlos was living in Termas de Ibirá. But five months ago, when I came to see my aunt, I found him living with her,’ Casali recalled.

‘I don’t know what sort of psychological illness he suffered from but he was normally a very affectionate person. However, when he was under the influence of alcohol he became violent,’ the cousin revealed.

The body of the retired teacher was found by homeless man, Henrique Camargo Miranda, on the pavement of Avenida Conselheiro Nébias, 50 metres from the beach.

He alerted night porter, Almeida de Souza Pereira, in the ten-storey, 70 apartments building, who recognised the victim.

Grim: The body of Claudia Macchione was found in this suitcase

According to a police report, when the suspect opened the door to his first floor apartment ‘he put his head in his hands claiming that he had been asleep and denied responsibility for the crime’. He did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs an investigator said.

The murdered pensioner was described as a gentle and pleasant woman by neighbours.

Building security guard, Rogério Lopes dos Santos said: ‘Claudia was an extremely polite and very quiet woman.’ But he labelled the son a ‘weirdo’ and a ‘recluse’.

‘Since he came to live here, almost a year ago, he didn’t talk to anyone just walked with his head down all the time. He would stay in the apartment night and day using his computers, laptops, and other devices,’ dos Santos said.

Preliminary investigations reveal the pensioner died from head wounds. Police have launched an inquiry into the motive behind the crime.
