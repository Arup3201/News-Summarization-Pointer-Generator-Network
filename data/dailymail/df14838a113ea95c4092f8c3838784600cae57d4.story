PC Gareth Gricks hanged himself at his home hours before he was due to be charged with child sex offences

A shamed police officer killed himself just hours before he was due to be charged with child sex offences, an inquest was told today.

PC Gareth Gricks, 53, was facing allegations of paedophilia in Thailand and a sexual assault on a young woman in the UK.

He had already been sacked after 19 years’ service with Norfolk Police and was set to be charged with nine offences.

But on the day he was due to answer bail the divorced grandfather was discovered hanged in the garage at his home.

Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Jacqueline Lake said: 'I will record a conclusion of suicide. I am satisfied he took his own life.'

The coroner read a statement from PC Gricks’ mother Shirley Matthews, which revealed he had been 'finding life difficult' before his death.

It read: 'It was clear that he had been finding life difficult because of things that were happening in his personal life.

'I have no doubt that he was trying to put on a brave face for the sake of his family and friends. But I believe he was feeling low and depressed in the weeks before he died.

'Gareth was a very popular person who will be much missed by his family and friends.'

PC Gricks hanged himself at his home in Dunton, Norfolk, on August 6 this year and his body was discovered by a member of his family.

The inquest in Norwich was told police officers found notes to Mr Gricks’ family and friends making it clear he intended to take his own life.

PC Gricks had been told he would be charged with three counts of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence and one of making indecent images of children.

He was also facing five counts of sexual assault against an adult female in this country.

Investigators believed he was using an online forum to make contact with girls under the age of 16.

Around 100 indecent images are said to have been found on his computer.

Misconduct: Gareth Gricks was dismissed from Norfolk Police in response to the allegations

PC Gricks, who was based at King’s Lynn, was first arrested in May, the day after he returned from a holiday in Thailand after allegations were made to police.

He was released on bail but sacked for gross misconduct on July 15.

Norfolk Constabulary today declined to comment on the conclusion of the inquest.

The force confirmed none of the alleged offences took place while he was on duty.

Speaking at the time of Mr Gricks’ death, Norfolk Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Nick Dean said the force took 'immediate action' after being told about the alleged offences.

The officer was arrested and suspended before being dismissed by the Chief Constable.

He added: 'As a result of his death, there can be no criminal prosecution and the investigation effectively ceases.

'However, in recognition of his role and the serious nature of the offences he was due to face, it is right and proper that this information is placed in the public domain - not only to demonstrate police action but also to give victims of sexual abuse a voice when this cannot be achieved through the judicial process.'
