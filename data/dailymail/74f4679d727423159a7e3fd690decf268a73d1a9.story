The Maryland mother accused of stabbing to death two of her children during an attempted exorcism was the leader of an unsanctioned church group called the 'Demon Assassins,' it was revealed this week.

One-year-old Norell Harris and his two-year-old sister, Zyana, were found dead in their beds at their home in Germantown last Friday.

Their mother, Zakieya Avery, 28 and another woman Monifa Sanford, 21, who had been staying with the family, have been charged with their murder and the attempted murder of the victims' older brother and sister.

Prosecutors said that a day before the killings, Avery had been scheduled to perform an exorcism ritual on a friend named Troy, but he never showed up at her home.

Avery, a recently divorced mother of four plagued with financial problems, claimed to be a commander of the four-person 'Demon Assassins' cabal she had started while worshiping at a Germantown church, with Sanford acting as her 'sergeant.'

The pair would later tell police they had taken part in exorcisms in the past, but the spiritual cleansings never featured knives or bloodshed, the Washington Post reported.

Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy offered new details on the ritualistic killing Tuesday, saying that Avery and her accomplice became convinced that the children were possessed by demons.

According to investigators, Avery tried to snap the neck of her 1-year-old son, then choked him and finally stabbed him with Sanford's help.

Convinced that the demon jumped into Avery's 2-year-old daughter Zyana next, the two women allegedly stabbed her to death as well before turning on her two siblings, ages 5 and 8, who suffered injuries in the attack.

Concerns: A neighbour of the family called 911 to report a child left inside a car outside the home for 45 minutes the night before it is believed they were killed in an exorcism ritual

When interviewed later by police, the two 
suspects described how they saw the children’s eyes darken 
and a black cloud hovering over one of the kids. 

‘Both
 defendants alleged that the demon leapt from the body of the last child
 into Ms. Avery and then attacked Ms. Sanford,’ McCarthy said during 
Avery and Sanford's first court appearance Tuesday.

Avery then bathed the dead children and wrapped them in blankets so they would be clean when they saw God, according to police. 

McCarthy
 added that Avery had been involuntarily committed to a mental 
institution in the past and that Sanford told officials she had tried to
 take her own life on two separate occasions.

According to Montgomery County Police Captain Marcus Jones, Avery told detectives she 'thought the devil was in the kids.'

'That's
 sort of the thing she centered it around as to why she had to conduct 
an exorcism,' he said. 'She just thought that there were evil spirits 
within the kids.'

Avery was arrested when authorities say she tried to flee from a 
townhouse near the vehicle. Police found the two children dead inside 
the home, and their siblings and Sanford were taken to the hospital with
 injuries.

Police said Sanford was arrested Saturday after being released from the hospital.

The
 tragedy unfolded at around 9.30am Friday when police officers 
responded to a home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive, where they 
came upon a 'very bloody scene' involving six people, four of them 
children under the age of 10. 

The two youngest children were pronounced dead at the scene.

The children's grandmother Ida Johnson, 90, told of her shock, describing the two young victims as the 'sweetest things'.

She said: 'I
 will cherish those memories forever,' she told MailOnline. 'Their lives
 were cut short and they had no say so whatsoever. It doesn't make 
sense.'

Mrs Johnson said the children's father, her grandson, Martin Luther Harris Jr. has traveled to 
the Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. to be with his
 surviving son and daughter who were both listed in stable condition 
Sunday.

Johnson said she didn't know if Avery had a history of violence or when the woman's relationship with Harris deteriorated.

'I don't know what was going on between the family, all I know is they were sweet kids,' she said.

The
 great-grandmother added: 'It's heartbreaking. Something should be done 
about who did it. But at the same time, it's not going to bring the 
children back. I just hope they get (what they deserve).'

Avery's stepgrandmother, Sylvia Wade, told The Washington Post that Avery was 'humble and meek' and said she loved her children.

'I
 don't know what triggered it,' she said. 'She wasn't herself. When a 
person is not of themselves, they are not responsible for what they are 
doing. They are in another zone.'

Startling change: Police arrested Monifa Denise Sanford, 21 (pictured at her arrest at right and earlier at left) Saturday following her release from a hospital and charged her with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted first degree murder

The other woman charged in the killings, Monifa Sanford, made similar 
statements about evil spirits during questioning, police said. The two 
women had been living together at the house in recent months.

Jones said the women are believed to have met each other at a church, which he identified as Exousia Ministries in Germantown.

According to Jones, while worshiping at the church, Avery was part of a dance troupe and started calling herself a demon assassin, but the moniker did not raise any concerns because she never talked about violence.

‘She was basically saying that her job — as of lover of Christ — was that she was going to keep demons away from her,’ Jones said. ‘That was part of her and Ms. Sanford’s goal.’

Jones added that when Darryl Joyce, senior pastor at Exousia Ministries, was asked about Avery’s ‘Demon Assassins’ group, the clergyman described it as ‘a little bit eccentric, a little bit over the top.’

Joyce has since issued a statement to the station MyFox DC saying the women were no longer members of his congregation at the time of the killing.

Both
 women were being held without bond on charges of first-degree murder 
and attempted first-degree murder.

During questioning, Jones noted that Avery acknowledged that what she did was bad, but allegedly did not sow the 'out-and-out remorse' one would expect to see in a parent accused of killing her child.

'Cases like this are heartbreaking' said Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims along with the 911 operators, police officers, evidence technicians, and fire and EMS personnel that responded,' according to the station WUSA9.

According to her Facebook page, Avery lives with her family in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and works as a pharmacy technician.  

Most recently, she wished happy New Year to her family on January 2. In mid-November, the 28-year-old indicated that she was in a new relationship.
