Legendary martial arts star Bruce Lee is getting the official biopic treatment, daughter Shannon Lee announced Friday.

Despite his untimely death in 1973 at age 32, Bruce Lee helped to create and popularize a genre that still endures and influences today with roles in films including 'Fist of Fury,' ''Way of the Dragon,' and 'Enter the Dragon.'

Bruce Lee Entertainment will produce the project in collaboration with Lawrence Grey ('Hope Springs') and Janet Yang ('The Joy Luck Club').

Bruce Lee's family is planning a new film based on the tragically short life of the martial arts icon

In the statement, Shannon Lee said the film will explore her father's writings, art and philosophies in addition to his martial arts stardom.

Neither a star nor a director has been set for the film.

At least one film about the star's life has already been produced. 

Daughter Shannon Lee said the film would cover areas of Bruce Lee's life that have not been given their due in previous projects 

The 1993 biopic 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story' was based on widow Linda Lee Cadwell's book.

That film, starring Jason Scott Lee as the titular star, was well received by critics and a grossed $63,513,743 at the worldwide box office.

Deadline quoted Shannon Lee's statement: 

'There have been projects out there involving my father, but they’ve lacked a complete understanding of his philosophies and artistry,' she said. 'They haven’t captured the essence of his beliefs in martial arts or storytelling. The only way to get audiences to understand the depth and uniqueness of my father is to generate our own material and find amazing like-minded partners to work with…many don’t know that Bruce Lee was also a prolific writer and a creator of his own unique art and philosophy.

'That’s what we want to show, not just his kick-ass physicality, but the depth of his character and beliefs.'
