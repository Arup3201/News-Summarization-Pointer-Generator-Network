Three days before they throw a state dinner for the president of France, President Barack Obama and his wife are whetting their appetite for - Mexican food.

The first couple were enjoying what could be a pre-Valentine's Day dinner on Saturday night at the Washington restaurant Oyamel.

The restaurant is owned by chef Jose Andres, who is well known in foodie circles.

Located in the Penn Quarter, it is famous for its guacamole and tacos.

The president and first lady Michelle Obama made a quiet entrance to the eatery, with a secret service agent noticed standing watch out front.

The pair are also known for frequenting award-winning Mexican restaurant Topolobampo in Chicago.

But while they are known for being lovey dovey, the two are never actually alone outside their White House living quarters.

During an interview with Jimmy Fallon last year, Michelle set the scene for a typical night out with her husband.

'We try to do date nights; it's a little tough,' she said.

'Barack has a 20-car motorcade, men with guns, the ambulance is always there. How romantic can you be?'

The couple, who have been married for over 20 years, will spend most of Valentine's Day apart.

Obama's schedule Friday is taking him to the Eastern Shore of Maryland to address House Democrats.

Afterward, he heads to California to meet with King Abdullah II of Jordan.

Obama is scheduled to spend the rest of the weekend in California.

The state dinner for French President Francois Hollande is Tuesday night at the White House.
