Mansfield boss Paul Cox knows his side will be in the cross-hairs of a Concord Rangers side chasing an FA Cup giant-killing on Tuesday night.

The non-league outfit, currently 15th in the Conference South, travel to Field Mill for their rearranged first-round clash after the original tie was postponed nine days ago.

The Stags are enduring a tough campaign, winning none of their last nine League Two fixtures, and Cox knows the minnows will travel to Nottinghamshire sniffing an upset.

Hereford United 2-1 Newcastle United (third round replay, 1972)

Norwich City 0-1 Luton Town (fourth round, 2013)

West Bromwich 2-4 Woking (third round, 1991)

Sutton United 2-1 Coventry City (third round, 1989)

Yeovil Town 2-1 Sunderland (fourth-round, 1949)

'We have to earn the right to play,' he told the club's official website. 'They'll probably be looking at us and our recent form and probably saying 'this is a game we want to get our teeth into'.

'As we've seen in the FA Cup, there's been a number of giant-killings. Any one who underestimates clubs in the lower leagues and non-league football can come up against an almighty shock.

'We want to go as far as we can in it [the FA Cup]. It's something that, in previous years, we have created great memories.'

League One Doncaster will also be aiming to avoid a shock when they make the journey to Weston-Super-Mare, also of the Conference South.

The original first-round tie was called off just 20 minutes before kick-off last weekend due to a waterlogged pitch so Rovers will make the long journey for the second time.

The South Yorkshire side will be big favourites to advance to a second-round clash with boss Paul Dickov's former club Oldham and defender Reece Wabara knows what to expect.

'We have to be realistic and expect to win,' he said. 'We know what we have to do.

'It's the FA Cup, anything can happen, it will be their cup final, they will all be up for it so we will be well prepared. We know they will come flying out of the blocks.'

In the pick of the first-round replays, League Two Dagenham travel to Conference Premier Southport, with the winner paired up with Eastleigh in the second round.

AFC Telford host Conference South Basingstoke while York travel to AFC Wimbledon.

Sheffield United will hope it will be what they do on the pitch that makes the news as they host fellow League One outfit Crewe while Walsall visit League Two high-fliers Shrewsbury.

Rochdale host League Two Northampton at Spotland while Notts County face a tricky test at Accrington.
