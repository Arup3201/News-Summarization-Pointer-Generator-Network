This is believed to be Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, the man imprisoned for almost 20 years by the Cuban Government

A former U.S. intelligence officer is claiming to have discovered the identity of the US spy freed by Cuba after nearly 20 years imprisonment.

The Cuban national was released on Wednesday along with Alan Gross, the American subcontractor held for five years in Cuba.

Today it was claimed that Rolando 'Roly' Sarraff Trujillo is the former cryptographer in Cuba's Directorate of Intelligence who worked secretly for the CIA.

Arrested in 1995 and sentenced to 25 years in prison, he is thought to have had access to closely held intelligence at the highest levels of the Cuban government.

Although U.S. officials refused to name him, a former Defense Intelligence Agency specialist on Cuba, Chris Simmons, told Newsweek he was '99.9 per cent sure' the mystery agent was Mr Sarraff Trujillo.

He told the magazine: 'I know of all the Cubans on the list of people in jail and he is the only one who fits the description. 

'I am 99.9 percent sure that Roly is the guy.'

It's believed Mr Sarraff Trujillo's family have been informed he is no longer at the prison he was held in for the past year, but they are yet to receive any official confirmation he has been released.

President Barack Obama said the spy was one of the most important intelligence agents America ever placed.

'This man - whose sacrifice has been known to only a few - provided America with the information that led us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today as well as other spies in the United States,' Obama said Wednesday. 

'This man is now safely on our shores.'

Obama said the agent's 'sacrifice has been known to only a few,' and called him 'one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba.' 

According to Brian Hale, spokesman for the director of national intelligence, the spy's information helped lead to the prosecution of Ana Belen Montes, a former senior Defense Intelligence Agency analyst who is serving a life sentence after spying for Cuba for 17 years; and former State Department official Walter Kendall Myers, serving life after spying for three decades.

Montes, who was arrested in September 2001, is considered one of the most damaging spies in recent history, because she had access to - and betrayed - U.S. intelligence activities in Cuba. 

'I think this is a tremendous gain for the intelligence community,' said Fran Townsend, a former senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration. 

'This was a very productive asset who was well placed, trusted by the Cuban government and helped us in a number of ways.'

She said it 'really is extraordinarily important to ongoing intelligence efforts when you are able to secure the release of an asset like this.

'It tells the world we remain loyal, we don't forget and we never abandon those who help us.'

The spy also helped the U.S. expose the 'Wasp Network,' in Florida, Hale said, a Cuban spy ring that included members of the Cuban Five, the last three of whom were released in exchange for the himself. Cuba also released 53 other prisoners.

The Cuban Five were convicted in 2001 of being unregistered foreign agents, and three were also found guilty of espionage conspiracy for failed efforts to obtain military secrets from the U.S. Southern Command headquarters.

'In light of his sacrifice on behalf of the United States, securing his release from prison after 20 years - in a swap for three of the Cuban spies he helped put behind bars - is fitting closure to this Cold World chapter of U.S.-Cuban relations,' Hale said.

Three of the Cuban Five - Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Labanino and Antonio Guerrero - were sent home to Cuba as part of the swap.

Hernandez had been convicted of murder conspiracy in the deaths of four Miami-based pilots whose small, private planes were shot down on Feb. 24, 1996, by a Cuban MiG in international waters off Cuba's northern coast. 

The 'Cuban Five' refers to intelligence agents whose so-called 'Wasp Network' operated in Florida in the 1990s. They were arrested in 1998 and later convicted on charges including conspiracy and failing to register as foreign agents.

Cuba insists they were not acting against U.S. sovereignty, only keeping tabs on militant exile groups that Havana blames for terror attacks on the island, including a string of hotel bombings.

However, prosecutors argued they also tried to penetrate military bases, including the U.S. Southern Command and facilities in the Florida Keys.

The three who remained imprisoned in the United States arrived to a heroes' welcome in Cuba on Wednesday. State TV broadcast images of them being embraced by President Raul Castro and having emotional reunions with family members, friends and neighbors. They were released in an exchange for a Cuban spy who had spent nearly 20 years in prison after working for the United States.

For years, Havana has made them an official cause celebre, rivaling the case of Elian Gonzalez, the boy rafter who in 2000 was caught in a tug-of-war between his Cuban father and family in Miami.

The 'Five Heroes,' as they are known in Cuba, are fixtures in state media and their faces grace billboards across the island. Schoolchildren are taught their names and take part in public acts demanding their release. However the five are reviled as spies by many exiles in South Florida.

One, Gerardo Hernandez, had been serving two life sentences plus 15 years on a murder conspiracy conviction stemming from the Cuban air force's 1996 shoot-down of two planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue, an exile organization that sought to aid migrants at sea and also dropped propaganda leaflets.

Hernandez was convicted of providing Cuban authorities with information about the flight, which he has always denied, maintaining it was public knowledge.

Rene Gonzalez, a dual U.S.-Cuban national, became the first of the agents to walk free in October 2011 after completing about 13 years behind bars. He was initially ordered to serve three years of supervised parole and remain in the United States, but in 2013 a judge allowed him to return to Cuba and renounce his U.S. citizenship.

Fernando Gonzalez, who is not related to Rene Gonzalez, was released in February 2014 after serving more than 15 years, and quickly deported to Cuba. The last three still in American lockups were Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero and Ramon Labanino.
