Pedophile: James Napier seen here in one of his booking photographs was sentenced to 240-years in jail for horrific sexual abuse

A Cincinnati man described as an 'enthusiastic participant' in child pornography involving an 11-month-old and a nine-year-old showed no remorse on Tuesday as he was sentenced to 240-years behind bars.

James O. Napier, 40, was ordered to pay $95,009 to his victims after being found guilty of recording a video of himself molesting the infant in November of 2009 and placing it online after having babysat the child.

Napier, who was found in possession of 1,300 child pornography pictures and 550 videos, also videoed himself making the nine-year-old girl perform oral sex on him, which he also placed on the Internet.

The undercover investigation into Napier, 40, began when FBI officials in Phoenix found Napier was actively trading online child porn across the globe.

Despite the horrific nature of his crimes, the judge was stunned by his total lack of remorse during his trial.

U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott said this was factored into his sentence.

'He sat still, emotionless. He did not appear ashamed. He did not appear concerned

'He appeared anything but remorseful,' court documents state.

Furthermore, the court was unsure how to demonstrate that justice had been done.

'The United States is unsure whether any sentence would he 'just punishment' under the circumstances,' said court memos.

Despite the severity of his crimes Napier showed no remorse during the trial, which factored into his sentence

Napier claimed to the court that he himself had been sexually abused in the past and told a probation officer he was molested between the ages of five and 10 by an older cousin.

'If true, the events of Napier's childhood sex abuse are tragic. However, these events do not grant Napier the right to subject at least two small children to repeated sexual abuse at his hands,' court documents state.

Testimony given during his trial revealed that in November 2009, Napier molested the 11-month-old after become involved with her aunt.

Police also testified that his pedophilic porn collection contained images and videos of children less than five-years old being raped and tortured for sexual pleasure.

'The initial investigation of Napier identified him as an active and enthusiastic participant in a community of morally depraved individuals who trade child sex abuse images and videos to satisfy their sexual desires,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Muncy told the court according to Cincinnati.com.

'One of his victims, due to her age, may never know the abuse she suffered. The other will never forget.'

The court heard that he abused the nine-year-old girl while her family were in the house.

'While they slept peacefully, she was being sexually assaulted by Napier. While they played in another room, she was forced to perform oral sex on him,' said court documents.

FBI agents arrested Napier on Jan. 18, 2013. He has been held without bond.

Napier was convicted following a three-day trial in January on nine counts of production of child pornography.

The jury also convicted Napier of one count each of transportation of child pornography, distribution of child pornography and receipt of child pornography.
