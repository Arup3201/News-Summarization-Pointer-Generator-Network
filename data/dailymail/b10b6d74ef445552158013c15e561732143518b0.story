Salma Hayek and her billionaire Parisian husband are hunting for a new home in London, sparking suggestions they are set to join 'l'exodus' of wealthy French to countries with lower taxes.

The Hollywood star, 47, and her 51-year-old husband François-Henri Pinault, owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, are said to be scouring Belgravia, Kensington and Notting Hill for a family home.

Their search comes as a number of French tycoons have indicated they are preparing to leave their home country following a crackdown on high earners by Socialist president François Hollande.

wealthy French fleeing high taxes

The actor Gérard Depardieu was recently granted Russian citizenship and the fashion tycoon Bernard Arnault has applied for residency in Belgium, although he denies he plans to move his financial affairs to the country.

Likewise Kering, the luxury conglomerate in which Mr Pinault holds a controlling stake, confirmed that the couple intended to rent a house in London but insisted he would still pay tax in France.

Residency has become a sensitive issue in the country after President Hollande proposed a punitive 75 per cent tax on people earning more than €1m (£840,000) a year.

The tax, which has been included in a draft budget for next year and is planned to apply for two years, sent shockwaves through the French business community.

But many of those wealthy individuals who threatened to leave the country have backed down, at least publicly, after a backlash which accused them of a lack of patriotism.

After Gérard Depardieu handed back his French passport and moved to Russia he later said he loved France as much as ever and the controversy over his departure was 'a big misunderstanding', The Times reported.

It came after the actor, who has made more than 150 films, wrote an open letter to France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault last year explaining why he was leaving his native country.

He wrote: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’

In August, he said he considered himself a 'citizen of the world' after a Belgian town made him an honorary citizen.

Bernard Arnault, head of luxury goods group LVMH - which includes the brands Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Moet & Chandon and Hennessy - officially transferred his assets to Belgium in January.

He had applied for a Belgian passport soon after the Socialists won elections in France last year.

The move involved transferring his 31 per cent stake in Groupe Arnault, the family holding that controls LVMH, to Pilinvest, a Belgian firm that he specifically set up for the purpose.

Mr Arnault insisted at the time that he wanted merely to keep the £5.5billion-stake in LVMH in the hands of his five children after he dies.

Belgium has a much more lenient tax regime than France – raising an inheritance tax of three per cent, compared to 11 per cent in France. Unlike France, there is no wealth tax in Belgium either.

Hayek was seen leaving a Claridge's hotel in Mayfair with a leading property agent on Thursday, according to The Sunday Times.

Kering confirmed to the paper that she and Pinault, who have one daughter, intended to rent a house in London 'for personal reasons'.

The company insisted Pinault would remain a tax-paying French citizen. 'Kering is a Euronext Paris-listed group with global operations,' a spokesman told The Sunday Times.

'Its registered headquarters is in Paris and the group plans to move into a new headquarters building in Paris in 2015.'

Mr Pinault was introduced to Hayek, who has been described as the world's most beautiful woman, by a former Gucci executive and married in Paris on Valentine's Day 2009 - 18 months after their daughter was born.

Mr Pinault already had two children by his first wife and a third by Canadian supermodel Linda Evangelista. He took over the running of his father's business empire, then called PPR, ten years ago.

His family also own the auction house Christie's, Chateau Latour, a vineyard in Bordeaux, and French football club Stade Rennais.

He told the Evening Standard in March: 'London is hot. For now, all the new designers are coming from London. This could be a weakness for France, as I do not see the same depth of new talent here in Paris.'
