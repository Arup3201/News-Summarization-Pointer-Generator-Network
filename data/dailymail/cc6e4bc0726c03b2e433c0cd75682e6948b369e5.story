US Navy Seals are believed to have killed a senior member of the terrorist group Al Shabaab in a pre-dawn raid on its headquarters in Somalia.

Residents in the coastal town of Barawe told news agencies they were woken by heavy gunfire and shelling early yesterday morning as soldiers came ashore in boats and launched an attack on a two-storey building.

US defence sources said helicopters were called in for air support as a battle raged for an hour in the coastal town 150 miles south of the Somalia capital Mogadishu.

Responsible: Somalian-based terrorist organization al Shabab took credit for the attack while it was going on

But the Americans were forced to withdraw before they could confirm the death of their terror target.

No details were revealed about fatalities or casualties among the Seals, but a spokesman for Al Shabaab boasted that the raid had been repulsed.

British and Turkish defence officials denied that their troops had been involved. Confirmation of the raid came as Kenyan police released the names of four Al Shabaab fighters they believe were killed in the Westgate mall attack – which left 67 people dead including six Britons.

Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattav al-Kene and Umayr are not  thought to have escaped the shopping centre alive. The four – who were seen on CCTV carrying rifles and patrolling storerooms inside the mall – supposedly died in a shoot-out with police.

Abu Baara al-Sudani is believed to have been the ringleader. He was apparently seen beckoning to the others. Omar Nabhan is thought to have been related to the mastermind of the Al Qaeda attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1991.
