Bill O'Reilly has launched an unprovoked attack on Beyoncé's latest video, labeling the work 'exploitative garbage' and suggested that it will encourage teenage pregnancy among African American girls.

Confronting hip hop mogul Rusell Simmons on Monday night, the Fox News host appeared outraged at explicit imagery of Beyoncé having sex in a car and referencing Monica Lewinsky in her Partition video.

O’Reilly said the video 'glorifies having sex in the back of a limousine,' and then warmed to his point saying, 'Teenage girls look up to Beyoncé, particularly girls of color. She’s an idol to them," he continued. “I’m saying: Why on earth would this woman do that? 

'Why would she do it when she knows the devastation that unwanted pregnancies - and fractured families - why would Beyoncé do that?'

Confrontation: Bill O'Reilly and hip hop mogul Russell Simmons face-off on Monday's O'Reilly Factor show discussing Beyoncé's new video for her song Partition

The 64-year-old host of the The O'Reilly Factor insisted to Simmons that Beyoncé has 'an obligation to protect children' and not to put out 'exploitative garbage.'

Giving no quarter, Simmons, who co-founded Def Jam Recordings in 1983, attempted to explain but O'Reilly became confused when the video and music was referred to as art.

'Bill, if you think that art that comes out of a community is the cause of the struggle–'

'That’s art?' O’Reilly interrupted.

'Yes, absolutely,' Simmons responded.

'Beyoncé in the back of a limo having sex and referencing Monica Lewinsky is art?' O'Reilly shouted.

'She's a brilliant artist,' Simmons shot back. 'And she's not only appreciated by people of color, as you know, she's really one of the top artists in the world to people of every color.'

Defense: Russell Simmons said that Beyoncé was an artist and her works reflects what is going on in the world and how she sees it

During the course of the typically confrontational interview, O'Reilly badgered Simmons who was on the show to promote his new book on meditation, which O'Reilly mispronounced as mediation.

O'Reilly led into the interview saying, 'As you know, I've been very critical of harmful entertainment marketed to largely unsupervised children.'

He admitted he loved Beyoncé's Superbowl performance 'brilliant' but attacked the video to Partition - in which the singer appears to be performing sexually provocative dance moves for the benefit of her partner of ten-years, Jay-Z.

Simmons tried to dodge any questions of the video, but said that he did 'think the artist's job throughout history has been to tell the same things that people are inspired by...so when an artist expresses something that is sexual in music, it's a reflection of our reality.')

Simmons then said that as a father of two girls, his 'daughters make choices based on the inspiration that we give them as parents.'

'But you're a good father,' O'Reilly jumped in. '...What about the kids who don't have an amazing mother and an okay father? What about them?'

Later in the discussion O'Reilly attacked Beyoncé's husband Jay Z and his friend Kanye West, to call the pair gangsta rappers and that he considers them responsible for influencing the youth in a negative way.

'You have to attack the fundamental disease if you want to cure it,' O'Reilly said.

'You're going to have to get people like Jay-Z, Kanye West - all these gangsta rappers - to knock it off.'
