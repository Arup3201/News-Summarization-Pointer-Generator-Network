She's made history by becoming the first plus-size model to feature in the Pirelli Calendar - but Candice Huffine is no stranger to the world of glamor.

The 29-year-old married beauty graced the cover of Italian Vogue in 2011 and featured in W Magazine, i-D, Harper's Bazaar and Vogue.

But before signing her first modeling contract in 2000, the size 13 Maryland native was a cheerleader and beauty queen who participated in pageants since she was 'a full-on baby'.

At just 14 after years of pageants, the fashionista decided to try her luck as a model in New York.

She was given a contract the first day - but there was some rejection involved.

'A few places wanted me to lose weight, and I was like, "Oh, okay, maybe that’s common?" I was a size six, so I thought I was hot stuff,' the 5'11" beauty told NY Magazine.

'I was a freshman in high school, tight little body, thinking, I’m going to be a model. And then when someone is like, "I need you to lose fifteen pounds." I [was] like, "How do you do that?!"

'And then when I finally was handed a contract, the stipulation was that [they’re] signing me under [their] plus board, and I never looked back.'

Now Huffine is part of the 2015 line-up for the Pirelli Calendar.

Also
 set to appear in the fetish-themed calendar styled by former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld are Adriana Lima, Natalia 
Vodianova, Karen Elson and Gigi Hadid.

The 
long-awaited calendar, nicknamed 'The Cal' by those in the industry, was
 shot by fashion photographer Steven Meisel and will debut in November.

It
 marks the first time in the calendar's 50-year history that a plus-size
 model will be one of the stars, and Ms Huffine is proud to have been 
picked.

'My presence on this set - the most glamorous in the world - is a sign that things are really changing,' she told Vogue.

She and the other models on set suited up in latex, leather and bustiers for the spread, channeling their inner dominatrix.

In one sneak peek that has been released, Candice looks pierce in black cat-eye eyeliner and a voluminous bouffant hairstyle.

The
 exclusive calendar, which is only delivered to an elite group of people
 in the fashion industry, has long been know for its tasteful 
celebration of the female form.

Huffine has always been considered a natural beauty, and although she is considered plus-sized, eats healthily and exercises regularly.

'The plus girls in this industry are some of the healthiest people I’ve ever met in my life. It’s not like we’re having parties at McDonald’s. The girls I know, they’re all doing yoga, run three miles a day, and they eat healthy, balanced meals,' she told NY Magazine.

'I prefer to cook because then I can control — like, I don’t add butter into my meals because then it just all becomes a little too rich. Every meal has a side salad, so it’s usually a meat, a side salad, and some sort of starch.'

The model will also be participating in the 2014 Race to Stop MS triathlon in New York in August as her mother suffers from multiple sclerosis.

She married her husband Matt Powers in October 2011. Her wedding snaps are online at jessicalavoiephotography.com.
