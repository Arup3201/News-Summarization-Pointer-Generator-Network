The last time England embarked on a World Cup in Brazil, they prepared with three days at Dulwich Hamlet and took a 31-hour flight with four refuelling stops, while their most famous player was sent elsewhere on a goodwill mission.

On reflection, it is probably no great surprise that the 1950 campaign has gone down as an object lesson in how not to win the World Cup.

The defeat to the USA in Belo Horizonte remains the biggest humiliation amid all the other failed attempts to land the famous  trophy as England stepped into the unknown on their first campaign with staggering complacency.

Farewell: England prepare to board the plane ahead of a 31-hour trip to Brazil ahead of the 1950 World Cup

On Sunday they will once again depart for Brazil and these days Roy Hodgson has a vast support staff, hi-tech training facilities and luxury accommodation to assist his plans. But 64 years ago, the first England manager Walter Winterbottom did not even pick the team.

Hodgson’s players first met up two weeks ago for a fitness camp in Portugal. They moved on to St George’s Park in Staffordshire for tactical preparation ahead of last night’s farewell game against Peru with all eyes fixed on the opening game against Italy, in Manaus, on June 14.

More than 70 strong, the FA party will fly first to Miami for more warm-weather training and two friendlies, then on to Rio de Janeiro next weekend.

Back in 1950, England won friendlies in Portugal and Belgium at the end of a season in which Portsmouth were crowned champions. As all the Football League clubs asked were busy re-seeding their pitches, they reconvened at Dulwich Hamlet’s ground in south London for light training on June 14 with only 11 days to go before the first World Cup group game.

‘We played a couple of seven-a-side games and that was it, off we went,’ said Winterbottom, who noted that the South American clubs had given up their players six months earlier, according to his biographer and son-in-law Graham Morse.

Morse’s book recounts how Winterbottom had told his mother Fanny: ‘There is a lot expected of a grand lot of players and myself. Don’t be too hopeful of us bringing that cup back, but we are all very optimistic and we will do our best.’

The England squad flew in a Panair do Brasil Lockheed Constellation on a flight lasting 31 hours, with refuelling stops in Paris, Lisbon, Dakar and Recife before arriving in Rio. The FA party was 17 players, four referees, two trainers, eight sports writers and the manager. Players were on the FA standard rate of £20 per game. Winterbottom’s salary was £1,000.

Stanley Matthews, who was 35 and had not won a cap for more than a year, flew instead to Canada to spread FA goodwill and Manchester United took Jack Aston and Harry Cockburn on a tour to the USA before they were released for World Cup duty.

England arrived in Rio with five days to spare. They trained in the morning and evening at Botafogo’s ground in the city  centre and stayed on the Copacabana in the Luxor Hotel, recommended to the FA by Arsenal, after they had toured Brazil.

The manager, however, did not seem impressed. ‘It was so hot that the players were exhausted, even in the hotel,’ said Winter- bottom, who banned swimming in the ocean and ruled the beach out of bounds after 10am. ‘It couldn’t have been worse for us. When Arsenal were there it was an end-of-season jolly, more or less a holiday.’

Matthews made it to Brazil on the day before the first game, so he was left out of the 2-0 win against Chile in Rio’s Maracana, which was still swarming with workmen. Winterbottom said it ‘resembled a building site’.

Some things don’t change and it was not the only parallel to be drawn. England’s best centre half was in exile as Neil Franklin had been banned after  moving to the newly-formed Colombian league, outside FIFA.

Other things have changed. ‘The food was terrible,’ said Matthews. ‘We were just  eating bananas mostly.’

Oxygen was on tap for the players at half-time. Captain Billy Wright said: ‘We gave it a test but found it of little use. Perhaps it was the difficulty to breathe which was directly responsible for my feeling leg-weary in the second half.’

Matthews was available but the sole team selector Arthur Drewry decided not to make any changes for the second game against the USA. Hodgson’s team will return to Belo  Horizonte to face Costa Rica and can only hope the outcome is less embarrassing.

England flew north from Rio and stayed nearby in the mining village of Morro Velho as guests of a British gold mining company. They limbered up with a friendly game of cricket against the Press.

At the stadium, changing facilities were
 so poor that Winterbottom took his players off to change at the nearby 
Minas Athletic Club before walking back to the ground. Inside, the pitch
 was small and dry and bumpy and England lost 1-0.

The only 
goal was a header by Joe Gaetjens, a Haitian who would return to his 
native island in the Caribbean, where he was later executed by the 
Francois ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier regime after disappearing in 1964.

Winterbottom
 grumbled about the referee who seemed to have missed a header by Stan 
Mortensen crossing the line before it was scooped out by a hand - not 
one belonging to the goalkeeper - but this was 60 years before Frank 
Lampard in Bloemfontein and the incident which hastened goal-line 
technology.

Besides,
 it was not the only issue. England realised they had come up short and 
that the World Cup was unlike anything they had experienced. They would 
lose their final group game to Spain and the plane taking them home to 
London was 24 hours late taking off. There is scope for improvement on 
all levels.
