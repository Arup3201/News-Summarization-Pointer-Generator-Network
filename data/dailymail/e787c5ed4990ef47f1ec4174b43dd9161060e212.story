They were supposedly selected for their business acumen and quick wits.

But it seems some of Alan Sugar’s latest acolytes could do with a refresher course in primary school mathematics.

Last night’s episode of BBC One’s The Apprentice saw two of its women candidates become completely befuddled by basic sums.

We're only here for the glamour:  Lindsay Booth, 29 (left), and Nurun Ahmed, 36 (right), were left scratching their heads when it came to doing the maths

Not that they were worried about revealing their embarrassing inability to perform simple mental arithmetic – declaring they were only on the show to provide ‘glamour’.

Lord Sugar had set his contestants the task of making and selling scented candles and reed diffusers, used to perfume rooms.

‘This task is dead simple,’ he said. ‘Choose a nice scent, package it nicely and work out your costs and your margins. There is nothing much to understand in this.’ 

Twin failures: Both Lindsay Booth and Nurun Ahmed found themselves fired by Lord Sugar on the BBC show

Half of these wannabe Apprentices are about to be fired by an unimpressed Lord Sugar 

As team Summit prepared a batch of fragrance, Lindsay Booth, 29, and Nurun Ahmed, 36, were left scratching their heads and yawning while colleague Sanjay Sood-Smith, 27, explained the maths on a whiteboard.

He told them they had 60 reeds, each of which needed to be immersed in 100ml of scent. Because 100ml of scent weighs 100g, they would require 6kg of scent.

Booth said: ‘I’m completely lost. I just don’t understand it. He’s done all the intelligent bit.’

Ahmed added: ‘I haven’t got a clue with the figures. I’ve just got to trust in you. Sanjay’s done all the hard work, bless him.’ 

To the evident dismay of Lord Sugar’s aide on the show Karren Brady, Ahmed added: ‘He’s done all the scientific bit and we just do the glamour.’

Booth, who has previously said she hates it when women are dismissed by chauvinistic men, agreed, saying: ‘Yep, we can’t all be intelligent.’ Lord Sugar later fired them for their poor displays.

Not happy: Nurun didn't take her firing as well as Lindsay and thought she should have stayed 

Empty seat: Accused of being 'just an empty seat in the team,' Lindsay Booth didn't argue and went further

And instead of the usual bravado that has become the show’s trademark, Booth conceded: ‘I know I didn’t do well … If he hadn’t have fired me I would have resigned.’

Ahmed added: ‘I’m not your type-A sort of person. I’m a type-C sort of person.’
