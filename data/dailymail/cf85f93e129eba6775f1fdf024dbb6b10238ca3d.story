Killed: Bruski, a one-year-old pit bull, was playing with another dog at a Cincinnati dog park on Tuesday when he was fatally shot by another dog owner who saw the dog bite his

An Ohio man accused of fatally shooting another dog in a dog park after its playing became too aggressive for his liking is facing jail time.

'I'm heartbroken. I've been crying all day,' Kaitlynn Hornsby sobbed after her one-year-old pit bull named Bruski was fatally shot while playing in the Cincinnati dog park on Tuesday, WLWT reports.

Ms Hornsby said that with little warning 74-year-old Robert Marx pulled out a 9 millimeter handgun when her dog's playing led it to biting his.

'As soon as it happened the dude ran 
up and threatened to shoot my dog and before we even had a chance to 
break them apart he shot him,' she said.

Several witnesses are said to have worked to help restrain the dogs when a shot rang out.

Bruski was struck in his leg, according to Ms Hornsby, shattering it beyond repair. The dog was later put down by a vet.

Gunman: Robert Marx faces a maximum of nine months in jail on charges of knowingly shooting a gun within city limits and criminal damaging

'There
 were kids there and he pulled out a gun and shot. A kid could have been 
hurt. I could have been hurt. I was holding my dog as he shot him,' she said.

Marx appeared in court on Wednesday on charges of knowingly shooting a gun within city limits and criminal damaging.

Police say he could not prove he was firing in self defense.

Convictions on both counts would carry a maximum of nine months in jail.

Marx, who has a permit to carry a 
concealed weapon, was released on bond and placed on electronic 
monitoring. He hasn't returned a message seeking comment.

An inspection of Marx's dog showed it was not injured in the incident.

A judge ordered Marx to stay away from the park and the couple who owned the pit bull.

‘We
 took him to the dog park all the time, at least twice a week and he 
never ever got into fights with dogs,’ said Ms Hornsby. ‘He was perfectly 
good with dogs. He loved to play with them.’
