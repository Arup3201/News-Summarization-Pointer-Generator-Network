After an awful start under the direction of new manager Louis van Gaal last weekend, Manchester United could use all the help they can get.

And perhaps these Buddhist monks were hoping they could provide some assistance from within, as they were seen visiting the club’s Old Trafford ground.

The supporters spent an hour in the megastore, before heading to the museum and leaving with a carrier bag containing club merchandise.

Buddhist monks: After an opening-day defeat, Manchester United could use all the help they can get

One of the monks was clearly a fan of more than one sport - as he was wearing a knitted hat with the New York Yankees baseball team emblem.

Former United player David Beckham 
became something of a hero among Buddhist monks when he sported a 
similar shaven hairstyle to them.

Beckham
 was described ‘British football's secret weapon in popularising the 
game in the Far East’ in a BBC News article by journalist Chris Horrie in 
2001.

It is certainly not the first time 
Buddhist monks have been seen at Old Trafford, the 75,731-capacity home 
of the Premier League club.

In a 2009 article Daily Telegraph 
reporter Henry Winter observed three of them posing for a photo in front
 of Sir Matt Busby’s statue at the ground.

And
 Unicef used funding from the club in 2005 to support the Buddhist Monk 
Leadership, a project providing help to HIV/AIDS sufferers in Asia.

The monks may have also been visiting the city’s Manchester Buddhist Centre, which has taught Buddhism and meditation to thousands of people since 1977.

United began their 2014/15 league season on Saturday with a 2-1 home defeat to Swansea City, with Wayne Rooney scoring their only goal.
