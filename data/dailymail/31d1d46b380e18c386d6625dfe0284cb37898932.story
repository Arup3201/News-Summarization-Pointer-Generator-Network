A man who tried to murder his girlfriend by burying her alive in a cardboard box has been sentenced to an additional four years in prison for possessing potentially dangerous explosives.

Marcin Kasprzak, 27, was jailed for 20 years in January for attacking Michelina Lewandowska with a Taser gun.

He then bound and gagged her and buried her in woodland under soil, leaves and a heavy tree branch.

Kasprzak was charged with the additional
offences after police investigating the attempted murder found large 
amounts of chemicals, formulae and recipes for making explosives at his 
home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

He was sentenced to four years at Leeds Crown Court, which will be served alongside his current term.

The court heard the chemicals had potential to cause serious damage or injury and were a danger to his three-year-old son, Miss Lewandowska and his parents who all lived at the house in a residential area.

Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'This was a large amount of explosive substances which in the wrong hands are capable of causing extensive damage and terrible injury.

'The danger to occupants including your very young son, your partner, your parents and other residents is obvious.'

But there is no suggestion Kasprzak intended to endanger life, injure or frighten people or damage property, the judge said.

Kasprzakâ€™s motive is 'obscure' but Judge Bayliss said he was satisfied that Kasprzak was experimenting.

He had 500g potassium permanganate, 
1.5kg aluminium power, 189g ammonium nitrate, 370g carbon, 476g sulphur,
1.212kg potassium nitrate, 1 litre of glycerol and 4kg iron oxide.

Jonathan
Sharp, prosecuting, said some of the chemicals can be combined to make 
explosive reactions or products including thermite, an incendiary 
mixture; aluminium nitrate fuel oil, a highly dangerous explosive 
substance which has been used in the past by terrorist groups; and 
gunpowder.

Formulae for making explosive substances were found displayed on a board in the spare room and Kasprzak had downloaded detailed instructions for the manufacture of nitroglycerine, an extremely dangerous explosive.

Other items found on a computer revealed that Karprzak had an intense and unhealthy interest in explosives.

But the court heard there is no evidence to suggest he had put any of the information he gathered into practice, beyond early experimentation.

Miss Lewandowska told police Kasprzak 
tried to make a firework inside the house and then went on to make 
firework effects in the garden.

But Kasprzak said he acquired the chemicals out of curiosity and denied any experimentation.

The court heard the defendant has no political interest or leanings and did not acquire the substances for 'nefarious purposes'.

Kasprzak pleaded guilty to eight counts of illegally possessing explosive substances. He was sentenced to four years for each count, to run concurrently with each other and the 20-year sentence for attempted murder.

Judge Bayliss said the offences do not compare to the gravity of the attempted murder which Miss Lewandowska survived by using her engagement ring to cut herself free from the cardboard box.

The two offences were unrelated, the judge said.
