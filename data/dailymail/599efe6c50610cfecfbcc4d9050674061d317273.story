Just call him Bubba, the one-eyed miracle dog.

The 8-year-old Chihuahua mix has been credited with giving his dying owner the will to live after the two were reunited at a Kentucky hospital.

Bubba's owner, James Wathen, 73, from Whitley County, Kentucky, has been at Baptist Health Corbin since mid-September.

Just what the doctor ordered: James Wathen, 73, wasn't eating and couldn't speak above a whisper before his reunion with his beloved dog, Bubba, last weekend 

Health crisis: Wathen, 73, from Whitley County, Kentucky, has been at Baptist Health Corbin since mid-September, and his 8-year-old pooch, pictured here during their second meeting, has been staying in a shelter

Course of treatment: Wathen is expected to meet with Bubba on a regular basis as he continues his recovery

In recent weeks, his health has taken a turn for the worse as Wathen stopped eating and speaking above a whisper. 

One of the social workers at the hospital recently visited the patient and learned from him that Wathen was pining for his beloved rescue Chihuahua, Bubba.

What neither Wathen nor the hospital staff knew at the time was that Bubba also quit eating.

‘We pulled out all the stops and found the dog,’ Kimberly Probus, chief nursing officer at Baptist Health Corbin, told WKYT. 

After making some phone calls, nurses at Baptist Health found out that Bubba, who lost his right eye in a fight years earlier and who is missing his lower teeth, was taken to the Knox-Whitley Animal Shelter after his owner was hospitalized nearly six weeks later.

Employees at the rescue center reached out to a foster family that has been caring for Bubba and scheduled to bring the pup to Baptist Health in violation of the hospital’s visitation policy, which did not allow pets.

Last Saturday, little Bubba was carried to James Wathen's hospital bed, and those who witnessed their reunion said there was not a dry eye in the room.

‘He was so sad at first. We had him wrapped in a baby blanket and he was shivering,’ shelter president Mary Ann Smyth told Today.com. ‘The minute we got about 20 steps from this guy’s room... his little head went up,’ ‘His eyes got real bright and he was like a different dog.’

The experience has left both the ailing dog owner and his four-legged pal completely transformed.

As soon as he set his one good eye on Mr Wathen, a previously listless and distraught Bubba came to life, and his owner began to cry tears of joy. 

In what nurses at Baptist Health described as a 'complete turnaround,' following Bubba's second visit Tuesday James Wathen sat up in bed for the first time in a long while, and started speaking and eating again.

A video recorded by Ms Smyth during that repeat visit shows Wathen lovingly petting Bubba, and the pup snuggling up to him and licking his gaunt face.

While Mr Wathen is not out of the woods yet in terms of his medical condition, hospital staff say he is no longer at death’s door.

Special bond: Bubba, who has been staying at an animal shelter and then with a foster family, stopped eating around the same time his owner did at the hospital 

’He doesn’t even look like the same man,’ nurse Kimberly Probus said. ‘I didn’t expect the improvement to be this good.

Wathen is expected to meet with Bubba on a regular basis as he continues his recovery, and the hospital is now planning to put in place a new pet visitation policy so that other patients could spend time with their four-legged friends.

‘It makes you realize that animals are not just pets,’ staff at the Knox-Whitley shelter wrote on their Facebook page, ‘they are loved ones.’
