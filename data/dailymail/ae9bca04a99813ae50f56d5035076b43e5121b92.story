A woman who thought that her stomach pains were signs of a burst appendix had an even bigger surprise when doctors told her she was in labor.

Mandy Batchelor had no idea that she was pregnant when her water broke on Friday and later that day she delivered a healthy baby boy.

Ms Batchelor had already given birth to two children and said that her body did not change at all over the past nine months.

New addition to the brood: Mandy Batchelor has two older children and said that she had no idea she was pregnant with a third before giving birth on Friday

No indication: Ms Batchleor said that she gained a little weight and experienced back pain but thought that was normal because it was winter and she stands throughout her daily shifts at a factory

Healthy: Even though his parents may not have been ready, the baby was and was born after a full term weighing 7 pounds and 13 ounces

She said that while she did notice a difference on the scale, she thought it was just her 'normal winter weight gain'.

The only other clue, she told KDVR, was that she had some lower back pain.

Even that is not unusual since Ms Batchelor regularly experiences it as a result of standing all day as part of her job at a factory near their hometown in Greencastle, Indiana.

'We had no idea when that happened... we knew nothing,' her partner Josh Cox said.

'She showed no signs of it.'

Men of the family: The baby's father, Josh Cox, weighed in heavily on the name General Lee Jacobs Cox after his two great grandfathers

New baby: The newborn has two older sisters who are adjusting to the new family member

After some quick deliberating, the couple decided to name the boy General Lee Jacob Cox, as General Lee is Mr Cox's  maternal great-grandfather's name and Jacob is his paternal great-grandfather's name.

Also dad Josh has a General Lee car, from the show Dukes of Hazzard.

Even though the parents may not have been ready for the Friday birth, the baby certainly was and was born weighing a healthy 7 pounds 13 ounces.

They announced the birth on Facebook, and have been updating friends and family with photos of 'LJ' getting used to home life with his older sisters.

'I was so shocked. So shocked,' Ms Batchelor said.

She had the bouncing baby boy just four hours after leaving work.
