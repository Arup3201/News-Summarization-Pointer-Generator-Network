A New York City woman tragically fell to her death into a rushing river while posing for photos near a waterfall at a tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico.

The body of Bronx resident Kenah Huggins was found on Sunday 
in a river in El Yunque National Forest near Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, after she slipped into the raging waters on Saturday. 

Huggins was apparently taking photographs in the mountain park and was swept away in the swift-moving waters after she lost her 
footing.

Tragedy: The body of Bronx resident Kenah Huggins was found on Sunday in a river in El Yunque National Forest near Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, after she slipped into the raging waters on Saturday

'She ended up in the pond, slipped, lost balance and fell into the water,' search and rescue manager Victor Lasanta told Puerto Rican newspaper, El Nuevo Dia.

The rushing waters 'carried her down the waterfalls' as her friends helplessly watched, unable to reach her, Lasanta added.

Police began efforts to recover the body at noon Sunday and her body was located later.

The New Yorker, who was 35 according to Lasanta, was in the Caribbean Island with friends and had no connections to the area.

'On behalf of the family an friends I wanted to take a 
moment to thank everyone for their warm words and condolences we truly 
appreciate every kind word and gesture,' a friend of the victim, Nicole Taylor, wrote on Huggins' Facebook page.

The rain forest, located near Rio Grande, includes several waterfalls and rivers

'One of Kenah's last updates said 'I'm a thinker, I absolutely live in my head ( a lot ) but I know I 
can't change the future & I am strong believer that everything has a
purpose for how, why, where & when...... So just go with it ;-) 
keep those words in your heart, from her. I will continue to update 
this page with any information that I receive regarding her homegoing 
services,' Taylor added. 

El Yunque is located in northeastern Puerto Rico and receives up to 1 million visitors a year. It is the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. 
National Forest system
