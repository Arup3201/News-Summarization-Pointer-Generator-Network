Marc by Marc Jacobs has just unleashed its latest campaign, starring 11 models who were cast directly from social media snaps.

For the second season running, the label has recruited its talent from the likes of Facebook and Instagram, this time picking subjects - admittedly all tall and skinny - from more than 100,000 photo submissions tagged #castmemarc.

The spring 2015 campaign - which was shot by David Sims and styled by Love editor Katie Grand - stars youthful men and women from around the world, all with bold signature aesthetics.

The 90s revival theme sees its international participants frolic around in acid colors, wearing shades or geek-chic glasses and sporting edgy haircuts.

'They kept saying rave, rave, rave,' said Dylan, from Nashville, Tennessee, who appears in a video about the shoot along with the ten other chosen models.

'I was shocked that I was picked as one of the contestants,' Eun Bi, from Seoul, South Korea, said. 'So right now, I am extremely happy. There are no words to explain my happiness.'
