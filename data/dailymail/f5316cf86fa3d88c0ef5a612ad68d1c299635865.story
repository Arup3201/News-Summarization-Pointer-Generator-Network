A gangland gunman who paralysed a five-year-old girl when he botched a hit on a rival was jailed for life today.

Nathaniel Grant, 21, was told he will spend at least 17 years behind bars for a shooting that shocked Britain and was described by a judge as an 'attack on society itself'.

He fired the bullet into a shop in Stockwell, south London that left innocent Thusha Kamaleswaran confined to a wheelchair and turned her family's world upside down.

Crippled: Thusha Kamaleswaren, right, at home with her brother Thusan, 13. She was shot by gangsters - and left paralysed - as she played in her uncle's shop in Stockwell, south London

Help: Thusha, now nine, is pushed on a special bike by her family, whose lives have been turned upside down

His two accomplices, 'sidekick' Anthony McCalla, 20, and 'enforcer' Kazeem Kolawole, 19, were also jailed for life.

The trio, who could have been behind bars on the day they shot Thusha, were members of Brixton's Gas - or Guns And Shanks - Gang, responsible for a trail of violence that has devastated parts of South London.

Judge Martin Stephens QC said all of the men pose a high risk to the public and none of them has shown a 'shred of remorse.'

He said: 'This is an exceptional case of the utmost gravity. The seriousness is such that a life sentence is necessary to reflect public abhorrence of these offences.

'Shooting twice into the small and confined shop where it was known there were people present can be denounced as an attack on society itself by men who saw themselves as outside and above the law.'

Kazeen and McCalla, who showed no response to their sentences, were told they will serve a minimum of 14 years.

Thusha’s family reacted with fury to the sentences – as all three men could be freed when they are still in their thirties.

Shopkeeper Vicknes Mahadevan, who witnessed his niece’s shooting, said: ‘It’s easy time isn’t it? They will all come out when they are still young men. Even though they took a gun and shot somebody.

‘They have still got lives to live. My family must live with this forever, not just for a number of years. When Thusha is in her thirties will these people still be thinking about her? I doubt it. It is terrible. We will never get over what has happened.’

It was previously revealed that the three men could - and perhaps should - already have 
been locked up.

Grant, known as ‘Killa Buzz’, was cleared of an almost identical gangland murder and released from prison just weeks earlier;

McCalla was on bail over a vicious bus brawl and probation 
staff considered recalling him to prison hours before Thusha was shot;

Kolawole had recently been spared prison for beating a 
schoolgirl and was wearing an electronic tag while on bail for carrying a
knife.

Earlier this week Thusha's family moved into a new home that has been refurbished to meet her needs.

Police officers were so moved by the family's plight that they have already raised £125,000 to go towards her care.

Kolawole, of Kennington, south 
east London; McCalla, of Streatham, south London; and Grant, of 
Camberwell, south east London, were told their crimes were ‘of the 
utmost gravity’.

Judge Martin Stephens QC said: ‘Much 
of what you did was captured on CCTV and has been shown on television 
screens across the land.

‘One can only imagine the effect on the public when they saw what you had done.’

He said the trio had gone out with a ‘determined, premeditated intention to kill’ that day.

Judge Stephens continued: ‘Mr Selvakumar was hit in the head but miraculously survived with a piece of bullet remaining in his head.

‘Five-year-old Thusha, who was dancing around with her family in the shop, was hit in the body.

'Only
the skill and devotion of the medical teams who became involved saved 
her life but she remains paralysed below her chest and this condition is
permanent.

‘This 
simple but devastating statement of the essential facts of the case 
illustrate the gravity of these offences, riddled as they are with 
aggravating factors.’

Judge Stephens told the trio: ‘Not one of you has, in my judgment, shown a sliver of remorse.’

Grant has previous convictions for 
robbery and possession of an offensive weapon, Kolawole for affray, and 
McCalla for robbery, affray, possessing an offensive weapon with intent 
and violent disorder.

The judge said they posed ‘a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm in the future’.

He said: ‘You, Grant, were the gunman
and the other two your fully supportive lieutenants backing up all your
actions to the hilt and giving you the support and encouragement to 
carry out these terrible deeds.

Mahadavan Vikneswaran is seen rushing to help her (right) as the 
shooting stops

Pitiful: He lifts her limp form from the floor 
and carries her to safety. Thusha's heart stopped twice on the way to 
hospital and paramedics feared she would die

‘In my judgment, this is an exceptional case of the utmost gravity.

Happy: Thusha before the tragedy

‘Shooting
into a shop, a confined space where it was known there were people 
present, is an attack on society itself by men who saw themselves as 
outside the law and above the law.’

Judge
Stephens said the convictions would not have been possible without 
CCTV, and that he hoped Thusha could go on to lead as full a life as 
possible.

The trio 
cycled up to Stockwell Food and Wine on March 29 last year and Grant 
opened fire into the shop, hitting Mr Selvakumar and Thusha.

Jurors were told he would have been able to see the girl as he fired his second shot.
The three men were members of the 
Brixton-based OC (Organised Criminals) gang, and were on the hunt for a 
member of their bitter rivals ABM (All Bout Money).

Thusha was hit in the chest and the bullet passed through the seventh vertebra of her spine.
She went into cardiac arrest twice and
had to undergo emergency surgery in the shop and at hospital, and is 
now permanently paralysed.

Mr Selvakumar has bullet fragments lodged in his head that cannot safely be removed.After the verdicts last month, Thusha, now six, told the Daily Mail: ‘I worry that someone will try to hurt me again.’

Her family has been left battling debt and mother Sharmila Kamaleswaran is said to have suffered insomnia and depression.

She said in a victim impact statement that seeing her daughter, who dreamed of being a dancer, in a hospital bed ‘took my heart away’.

Outside court, Detective Superintendent Gordon Allison said the only time the gunmen had apologised was when they wanted to reduce their prison sentences.

‘They have been sentenced to life imprisonment for these offences and hopefully they will have time to reflect on their crimes,’ he said.
