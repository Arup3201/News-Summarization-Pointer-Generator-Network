'Deluded': David Jones MP faced a deluge of criticism for his views on gay parenting

Gay couples are incapable of bringing up children safely, a Cabinet minister claimed yesterday.

Same-sex partnerships could not provide a ‘warm and safe environment’ to raise a family, said Welsh Secretary David Jones.

The Tory MP, who voted against this month’s gay marriage Bill, added: ‘I regard marriage as an institution that has developed over many centuries, essentially for the provision of a warm and safe environment for the upbringing of children, which is clearly something that two same-sex partners can’t do.

‘Which is not to say that I’m in any sense opposed to stable and committed same-sex partnerships.’

The married father of two later insisted he was not homophobic and had gay people  in his life ‘who are important to me’.

In a statement, Mr Jones said he was not opposed to gay couples adopting children and added: ‘I simply sought to point out that, since same-sex partners could not biologically procreate children, the institution of marriage was one that, in my opinion, should be reserved to opposite sex partners.’

His comments drew a storm of protests from politicians and gay rights groups.

Andrew White, the director of Stonewall in Wales, called the remarks ‘offensive and inaccurate’.‘There are many different types of family in Wales today, including many same-sex couples raising children,’ he said.

‘It’s deeply undermining to families and children when they hear this sort of ill-informed comment.’ Labour’s Welsh spokesman Owen Smith said it showed the Tories were ‘out of touch’ with modern Britain.

‘David Jones’s comments are profoundly 
offensive and he should apologise immediately,’ he added. Downing Street
 last night said David Cameron rejected Mr Jones’ claims.

‘The Prime 
Minister believes gay families can provide a warm and loving home for 
children and has campaigned for more children in care to be adopted, by 
same sex couples and heterosexual couples,’ said a spokesman for No 10.

Mr Jones was one of two Cabinet members and among the 136 Tory MPs who voted against the Equal Marriage Bill earlier this month.

He claimed his Clwyd West constituents were opposed to same-sex weddings – and to civil partnerships being converted to marriages.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson also
 rejected the legislation, which was eventually voted through in the 
House of Commons despite opposition by more than half of his party’s 
backbenchers, who were allowed a free vote.

In 2011, there were 8,000 same-sex families with dependent children in 
the UK, of which 5,000 were in a civil partnership and 3,000 cohabiting,
 according to official figures.

Gay couples have been free to adopt children for a decade and since 2007
 it has been unlawful for adoption or fostering services to discriminate
 against them.
