A 20-year-old man is suing Nassau County Police Department for what he claims was an unprovoked attack following a routine traffic stop.

Kyle Howell from Westbury, New York, suffered a broken nose, bone fractures near both eyes and facial nerve damage as a result of the April 25 incident.

His lawyer has submitted surveillance video from a local shop which he claims shows his client being viciously attacked by two officers.

Court records show Howell was charged with assaulting the officers, tampering with physical evidence and resisting arrest, among others.

Police alleged in felony complaints that Howell tried to eat a bag of marijuana and punched and kicked them after ‘a violent struggle ensued as officers attempted to retrieve the evidence’ and arrest him.

Police also alleged potential evidence was partially destroyed by the time they subdued Howell, who caused injuries to the officers that required hospital treatment.

They also charged him with marijuana possession and criminal possession of a controlled substance after reportedly finding a small bag allegedly containing cocaine during a search of Howell's 2002 Honda.

Security video footage shows one of the two officers rush to the drivers seat when Howell is sat and start kicking and punching him in such a manner that the cars rocks

‘I remember getting a knee to my face and after that, I don’t really remember much. I was hit in the head so many times,’ Howell told CBS New York. ‘They were telling me to spit something out of my mouth.’

Howell denies that claims. He was release on $10,000 bond following a hospital arraignment.

Attorney Amy Marion filed a legal claim against the county on Monday seeking unspecified damages.

It claims that Howell was the victim of false arrest, excessive police force, and deprived of his civil rights, including by Nassau University Medical Center employees who concealed illegal police behavior.

After seeing the video, prosecutors have launched a probe and police internal affairs investigators also are looking into the officers' actions.

Eleven days since the incident and Kyle Howell's eyes remained bloodshot during a news conference on Tuesday in Garden City, N.Y.

At Tuesday press conference, Kyle was joined by his father and mother, Donovan and Joan Howell, and attorney Steven Gaitman

‘We've seen this video and have been investigating both the actions of the officers as well as the charges that the police filed against Mr. Howell,’ said Nassau District Attorney Kathleen Rice.

The officers involved have been identified as Vincent Logiudice and Basil Gomez, reports Newsday.

Both officers are on modified duty where they don't have contact with the public and can't earn overtime pending the outcome of the internal affairs probe, Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter said.

Nassau County police have not commented, citing pending litigation.

Howell conceded he was arrested twice in 2012 and pleaded guilty to petty larceny and marijuana possession.

Howell is then dragged from the vehicle and charged with assaulting the officers, tampering with physical evidence and resisting arrest
