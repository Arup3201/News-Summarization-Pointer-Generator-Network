President Obama's chief spokesman refused on Thursday to rule out the possibility that the U.S. will strike a nuclear deal with Iran while the Islamic Republic holds several Americans captive – including a Washington Post journalist being tried by the mullahs' Revolutionary Court without public notice of the charges.

The case is the mirror opposite of Cuba, where the White House announced steps toward normalizing diplomatic relations on the condition that President Raul Castro release American Alan Gross and a Cuban citizen who had been a U.S. intelligence asset.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said efforts to slow down Tehran's ability to create fissionable nuclear material that could be used in long-range weapons remain unrelated to the administration's attempts to free four Americans.

'These two priorities have been raised on two separate tracks, but they are priorities nonetheless,' he said.

NOT RULING IT OUT: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. isn't linking the releas of prisoners in Iran to a nuclear deal with the Islamic republic

Earnest did reiterate the Obama administration's call for their release, but said balancing the intertwined hostage and nuclear talks is 'one of the more vexing and far-reaching policy challenges' facing the West Wing and the State Department.

The captives include Washington Post correspdent and Iranian-American Jason Rezaian, and Americans Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini and Robert Levinson.

Levinson is officially considered 'missing' because Iran hasn't acknowledged holding him.

Hekmati has been detained in Iran since August 2011 'on false espionage charges while visiting his family in Iran,' according to the U.S. State Department.

Abedini has been held since September 2012 and was sentenced to eight years in prison for 'undermining national security' – in reality a prosecution for helping Christians operate 'home churches' that provide places for Iran's estimated 700,000 non-Muslims to worship.

At the time of his arrest, Abedini was building a state-approved orphanage. 

Levinson went missing in March 2007 on Kish Island, a place that foreigners can visit without visas. Oran hasn't denied holding him.

Rezaian was scheduled to appear before a Revolutionary Court tribunal on Thursday. 

'The White House is certainly aware of Iranian press reports stating that Jason Rezaian's case has been referred to a court,' Earnest told reporters.

'We continue to monitor the situation closely and to seek further information,' and 'call for his immediate release.'

He said Secretary John Kerry had raised the Rezaian case during a meeting this week with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif 

'Secretary Kerry raised Mr. Rezaian's case,' Earnest said. 'That is an indication of how seriously the United States takes this case.'

Kerry, he said, also called for the release of the other three captives.

But 'at the same time,' Earnest insisted, 'we've also been explicit about the fact that these conversations, while important, are separate' from negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.

'These two priorities have been raised on two separate tracks, but they are priorities nonetheless.'

'We believe these American citizens should be released,' Earnest told reporters. "And we also believe the Iranian regime should take the steps that are necessary' to end crippling economic sanctions and bring transparency to its nuclear ambitions.

He dismissed concerns that President Obama has treated Iran with kid gloves, compared with his insistence that Cuba release prisoners before a diplomatic deal could move forward.  

Even with an agreement on the hostages, Earnest said, 'the relations between the U.S. and Iran would fall far from normal.'

He cited 'their rhetoric and treatment of Israel,' and said 'there are a whole host of concerns we have with the Iranians.'

'Our concerns with Iran,' he said, 'are part of a much longer list.' 

The U.S. remains opposed to Iran's nuclear program. According to the White House, Obama told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday that America 'is focused on reaching a comprehensive deal with Iran that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and verifiably assures the international community of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.'
