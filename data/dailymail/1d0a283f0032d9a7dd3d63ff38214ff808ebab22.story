New Jersey consumer affairs officials have sued six gas stations that they claim sold fuel meant for airplanes to unsuspecting drivers who thought they were filling up their cars over two days last year.

Authorities say a probe by the Office of Weights and Measures found the stations sold the fuel from December 6-8.

The stations are located in the towns of North Plainfield, Trenton, Manasquan, Lawrenceville and Scotch Plains.

Gas pains: New Jersey consumer affairs officials have sued six gas stations that they claim sold fuel meant for airplanes to unsuspecting drivers who thought they were filling up their cars over two days last year

Trouble at the pump: This gas station in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, was among the ones facing a lawsuit that charges it provided aviation fuel in its pumps for cars

The lawsuit announced Tuesday also names parent company Zephyr Oil, fuel distributor Pasmel and fuel transporter Lee Transport.

Citing the lawsuit, the Star-Ledger newspaper reported that on December 4, Zephyr purchased about 73,000 gallons of aviation gas stored at a fuel terminal in Bayonne.

That same day, Zephyr reportedly sold the fuel to Pasmel at a substantial discount in comparison to what the price of premium auto gasoline at the time.

Officials say the sales were discovered 
after an employee of the terminal where the fuel was being held in 
Bayonne learned from a transportation driver that aviation fuel was 
being delivered to the gas stations.

Consequences: Aviation fuel contains toxic lead that could damage a car, which predominantly run on unleaded gasoline

The lawsuit claims that Zephyr, Pasmel and Lee Transport were all aware or at least should have been aware of the mix-up.

Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said in a statement to the Star-Ledger that he would seek monetary damages for anyone who could prove that their vehicle had been damaged by the bad fuel.

Mr Chiesa said: 'We allege that these gas stations clearly knew, or should have known, they were selling aviation fuel that contains toxic lead, while advertising it as unleaded gasoline for motorists.'

The aviation fuel contained toxic lead that could damage the vehicles, but say it doesn't appear any cars were affected.
