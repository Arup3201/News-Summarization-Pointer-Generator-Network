The principal ballet dancer with Russia's Bolshoi Theatre claims he is being forced out of the troupe over allegations that he was part of an acid attack that nearly blinded its artistic director.

Nikolai Tsiskaridze, 39, has been told he must leave at the end of the month amidst claims by Bolshoi director Anatoly Iksanov that he may have been involved in the attack on Sergei Filin.

The acid hit, which took place in January, left Mr Filin with severe burns to his face and eyes.

Mr Tsiskaridze has denied all allegations, claiming he is the victim of a smear campaign.

Mr Tsiskaridze's relationship with Mr Iksanov soured sharply after the Bolshoi director suggested that the Georgia-born dancer might have played a role inciting the attack.

Mr Tsiskaridze, who has been at the Bolshoi since 1992 as principal dancer and teacher, hit back saying the manager was conducting a witch hunt against him.

'This is hounding of the sole and most famous artist of the Bolshoi Theatre,' the dancer said.

The principal dancer has now been told that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of June, Bolshoi spokeswoman Katerina Novikova said, but refused to give the reason for the decision.

The Bolshoi, one of Russia's best-known 
cultural symbols, filed two reprimands against Tsiskaridze for giving 
unauthorised interviews after the attack on Mr Filin.

Tsiskaridze appealed and a Moscow court annulled one of the reprimands. Multiple reprimands can be ground for dismissal under Russian law.

A Tsiskaridze protege at the Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko and two alleged accomplices were charged over the attack and are in jail awaiting trial.

They face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.

It has been claimed that the reason behind the attack was 'rivalry over roles' after Mr Filin rejected Mr Dmitrichenko's girlfriend for the lead role in Swan Lake.

Mr Filin, who has been receiving medical treatment in Germany since the attack, has vowed to return to work as soon as possible.
