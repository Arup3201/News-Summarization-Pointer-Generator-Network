A family with two young children were kicked off a flight after a pilot refused to fly when their two-year-old daughter had a tantrum.

Toddler Natalie Vieau kicked up a fuss as her parents and older sister Cecilia, three, boarded a flight to Boston after enjoying a winter vacation in the Turks and Caicos.

Her mother Dr Colette Vieau said she did her best to calm her daughter down but was just hoping for 'some humanity' from the airline.

Grounded: Three-year-old Natalie Vieau's tantrum caused her family to be kicked off a JetBlue flight from Turks and Caicos to Boston on February 18

The family were travelling from Providenciales International Airport on a JetBlue flight on February 18.  

When Natalie threw a tantrum and refused to sit down, her parents managed to get her seat belt fastened and held her in place.

However the pilot and a flight attendant still decided they were unable to take off with the family on board and they were asked to get off. 

Dr Vieau told Msnbc: 'We were holding them down with all of our might, seat belt on.

Disbelief: Dr Colette Vieau said she did her best to calm her daughter down and had hoped for some 'humanity' from the airline

'She [the flight attendant] said, ''The pilot's made a decision to turn the plane around.'''

The mother of two added: 'We weren't beligerent, drunk, angry, screaming... we were just having a hard time struggling with our children.'

After leaving the plane, the family found themselves stuck on the island as there were no more flights that day.

Tantrum: The upset toddler was being held in her seat by her parents with her belt on but a flight attendant insisted the plane could not take-off with the family on board

Happy holidays: The family, from Boston, had spent a winter vacation in the Turks and Caicos islands

After booking a hotel for the night and more flights to get them home, the Vieau family were out of pocket more than $2,000.

Dr Vieau said she was not specifically critical of JetBlue's policy but 'airplane travel today in general'.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from JetBlue today.

On the airline's website, JetBlue have a 'Customer Bill of Rights', where they state: 'JetBlue Airways is dedicated to bringing humanity back to air travel.'

The Turks and Caicos Islands are located 550 miles south of Miami in the Atlantic Ocean. The flight to Boston takes approximately four hours.

Fun in the sun: After enjoying a Caribbean holiday, the family were forced to pay an extra $2,000 for a hotel and new flight after being taken off a JetBlue flight

Going nowhere: The pilot of the JetBlue flight to Boston would not take off with the family on board last month
