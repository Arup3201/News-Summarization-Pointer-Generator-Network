A little girl with learning difficulties has been banned from her local Brownie group over 'health and safety concerns'.

Kacey Godfrey, seven, was devastated after being told to hand back her uniform by Girlguiding bosses, who said there were not enough staff to cope with her.

Her parents Donna, 36, and Simon, 38, now fear their daughter will lose touch with friends she met in the Rainbows, the Girlguiding group for five to seven-year-olds.

Heartbroken: Little Kacey Godfrey gives the Girl Guide salute in her Brownies uniform. Her mother says the child has been left in tears by the ban

'I think it’s cruel not to let her join just because they say they don’t have enough helpers to supervise her,' said Mrs Godfrey.

'She’s been in Rainbows for years and had no trouble. But after three weeks at Brownies they told us that she can’t be enrolled with all of her friends because of her learning disabilities.

'All it is, is that she struggles a bit with her alphabet and has a reading age two years behind other children her age.

'I think they don’t want to enrol her now as it will be harder to get rid of her later.'

Kacey, from Billericay, Essex, joined 3rd Burstead Brownies – for girls aged from seven to ten – last month after her mother had informed the group leader of  her difficulties.

'Out of order': Kacey's mother Donna believes that her daughter's exclusion from Girl Guides is discrimination

But the family later received a call saying she could not attend future meetings.

Mrs Godfrey said: 'I was getting Kacey ready for Brownies last week when I received a very abrupt phone call from Julie Nye [Girlguiding UK’s South East Essex County Commissioner].

She told me Kacey would not be allowed to come any more due to health and safety concerns and told me to return her uniform immediately.'

The mother of four, whose husband is an area team leader for a home shopping business, added: 'Kacey still wants to go and doesn’t understand why they won’t let her be with her friends. 

'They’ve told me they want to talk to the school about her learning disabilities but why does she have to be banned from meetings in the meantime?'

She said: 'I wish I’d never told them about Kacey’s learning  difficulties now.

'They are making out she has been kicking people in the shins but Kacey would never do anything like that.

'We have never had a problem with Kacey before.'

Girlguiding UK – formerly the Girl Guides Association – is the largest voluntary organisation for girls and young women in the UK, with more than 500,000 members.

In its national pledge, leaders must ensure 'all reasonable steps for the inclusion of disabled girls, young women and adults into guiding  are taken'.

Young members are also encouraged to train for a disability awareness badge.

A Girlguiding UK spokesman said yesterday that the organisation was 'in discussion with Kacey’s family to resolve this situation', adding that the problem had been caused by a lack of information on Kacey ahead of her joining.
