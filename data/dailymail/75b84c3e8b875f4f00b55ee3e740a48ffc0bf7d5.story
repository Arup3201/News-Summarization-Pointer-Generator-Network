A Pennsylvania woman is facing homicide charges after allegedly supplying heroin to her 19-year-old boyfriend, who then died of an overdose.

Carly Stevenson, 27, was arrested Monday in connection with the September death of Brandon Cron.

Stevenson, of Hatboro, is charged under the drug delivery resulting in death statue. The woman also faces counts of reckless endangerment, lying to authorities and drug possession.

She's being held at the Montgomery County jail on $100,000 cash bond. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for December 20. If convicted, the 27-year-old Hatboro resident could face up to 40 years in prison.

It has taken prosecutors more than two months to charge Stevenson because they were waiting for autopsy and toxicology results, which determined that Cron died from 'an adverse reaction to heroin.'

Philly.com reported that on the afternoon of September 29, Miss Stevenson called 911 to report that her boyfriend was 'blue in the lips, cold to the touch and not breathing,' according to the District Attorney's Office.

Paramedics who arrived on the scene in the 100 block of North York Road just after 12pm pronounced 19-year-old Brandon Cron dead.

Officers then discovered a pair of syringes and wax paper bags often used to package heroin stamped with 'I'ma Boss' and 'Primetime' in a trash can outside Stevenson's apartment.

An investigation has revealed that Stevenson allegedly gave her boyfriend heroin on the eve of his passing, and then tried to get rid of the evidence before police arrived.

During questioning, Stevenson told 
detectives that Cron had last used heroin September 27 and that she last
saw him alive on the night of September 28.

When
she discovered the following morning that he was unresponsive, 
according to Montgomery News, the 27-year-old attempted to revive him by performing 
CPR and placed a wet towel on his face.

The woman said she was a heroin addict, but told police that she had been clean for six months. Stevenson had initially suggested that her boyfriend may have scored heroin from a dealer, but later changed her story, admitting that she was the one who picked up three baggies of the drug for $30.

According to his Facebook page, Cron worked as a welder for U-Haul and lived in a recovery home in Quakertown since completing a drug rehabilitation program in May. 

On her Facebook page, Stevenson reportedly claimed that she had done nothing to hurt Cron and lamented being banned from his funeral by the teen's parents.
