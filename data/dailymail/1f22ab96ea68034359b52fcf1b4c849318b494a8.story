The football hooligan who smacked a goalkeeper in the face was drunk on a cocktail of 10 pints of cider, a bottle of vodka and cans of lager Stella Artois.

Disgraced Leeds fan Aaron Cawley's level of alcohol consumption was laid bare as he was jailed for 16 weeks after attacking Sheffield Wednesday's Chris Kirkland on Friday night.

In a reminder of the darkest days of hooliganism, the 21-year-old from Cheltenham ran onto the pitch at Hillsborough after his own team scored before violently shoving the keeper to the ground on live television.

The unemployed labourer's solicitor Elizabeth Anderton said at Sheffield Magistrates' Court: 'It was a drunken, stupid mistake,' adding he claimed he did not even remember the incident.

Disgrace: Unemployed Aaron Cawley caught Sheffield Wednesday keeper Chris Kirkland flush in the face in a sickening assault fuelled by incredible amounts of booze

Disgrace: Thousands of football fans witnessed the shocking attack on Friday night, which was seen on live TV

Kirkland, who has played for England, was shoved to the ground moments after conceding an equaliser in the 76th minute.

He fell to the ground after the attack and was attended to by medics.

The shocking scenes were caught on camera by Sky Sports which was broadcasting the derby game.

Cawley wore a blue T-shirt at today's hearing, exposing an 'LUFC' tattoo on his neck and a Leeds United club crest on his right arm.

Sheffield Magistrates Court heard the 21-year-old had been the subject of two football banning orders in the past, which he had breached four times.

Despite living with his mother in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, he had supported Leeds United all his life and went to every game - home and away, a district judge was told.

Prosecutor Paul Macaulay said Cawley told police he was so drunk he could not remember the incident, which has been seen by millions of TV viewers.

District Judge Naomi Redhouse heard that Cawley, of Blenheim Square, Cheltenham, only realised what he had done when other people told him and then he saw himself clearly on TV.

He emailed the police to say sorry and also emailed Sky Sports in the hope that his apology would be passed on to the two clubs and Kirkland.

His solicitor Elizabeth Anderton asked the district judge to accept that her client pushed Kirkland rather than slapped him.

She said Cawley had shown a 'great deal of regret and remorse'.

'It's certainly not something he would ordinarily do,' she said, adding that, as well as drinking a huge amount of alcohol, her client had not eaten before the match.

'He was absolutely disgusted by his own behaviour,' she said.

But District Judge Redhouse said she had no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence.

She said a huge effort had been made to tackle hooliganism in football and 'make football an event where there's no violence and where families are happy to attend with children'.

The judge said footballers were at matches as part of their employment and that everyone has the right to be 'protected from being assaulted by a stranger' at work.

She also noted that, while she had heard all the evidence about how much Cawley had to drink, she did not see any evidence of his drunkenness on the TV footage she had been shown.

Later, Cawley returned to court where he was formally given a six-year football banning order.

One of the conditions is for him to stay at least a mile away from football stadiums where Leeds United are playing on match days. He was handcuffed before being led from the dock.

Trouble: Aaron Cawley had already been banned from entering any football ground in Britain

Cawley was barred from all football matches for five years at the age of 16 
after being caught at the centre of a 200-strong riot at the team's 
Elland Road ground.

Magistrates subsequently extended the ban to the end of 2013 after the thug repeatedly breached the order.

Former England keeper Ben Foster fears a player could one day be confronted by a knife-wielding thug on the pitch.

The West Bromwich goalkeeper said: 
‘The guy who interrupted the Boat Race got six months. Why can’t someone
who runs on to the pitch and slaps Chris in the face get at least that?

‘If someone has got it into their 
head that they are going to run on to the pitch with the aim of hurting a
player, they will do it — regardless of how many stewards there are.

‘It’s impossible to put a steward 
along every metre. You have to trust the fans to behave themselves. I 
was watching it and it made me feel sick.

'I wish Chris had  flattened him. I wish he had fronted him up and given him a boot up the a***. But Chris isn’t expecting it.

'He’s been smacked in the face and 
didn’t have a clue what was about to happen to him. That lad could have 
had a blade. It’s ridiculous if you think of it like that. To be quite 
honest, it’s scary.’

Wednesday manager Dave Jones has called on fans to ‘police their own’ in the wake of the attack.

Jones, the subject of foul-mouthed 
chanting from Leeds fans, told 5 Live’s Sportsweek: ‘It’s a football 
match and we’re looking at blaming police and stewards because they’re 
not there. He was a hero, he ran in the crowd, they were slapping him on
the back, so what do you do about that? It’s not one person.

‘In this country we seem to end up 
going with the minority all the time and it’s going to take the majority
to sort it out. You’ve got to police your own clubs.

‘The people who go to the games who 
are disgusted — and it’s going to be hard — they are the ones who should
walk out and isolate or point out the  people there who are doing it.

‘Neil Warnock said I was upset 
because I didn’t win the game but Neil must be deaf and blind because 
there wasn’t just one person chanting vile stuff.’

Leeds boss Warnock believes the law should make a stand to prevent these incidents from happening.

'Every club has got these fans and 
it’s got to start at the very top,’ he said.

‘It’s all right saying, “Go in and 
get them out”, but you’ve got to be there. It’s frightening for stewards
— I wouldn’t want to be a steward.’
