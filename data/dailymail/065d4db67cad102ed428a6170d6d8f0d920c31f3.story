Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has joined CBS News - and the one-time diplomat  wasted no time taking her first snipe as a journalist at Democratic President Barack Obama.

Rice, who also served as National Security Adviser to Republican President George W. Bush, will work for the network as a 'contributor,' according to a statement circulated by CBS and obtained by The Huffington Post.

The political science professor got started Sunday, making her 'first CBS appearance in her new role on the 'Face the Nation.'

In response to a question, the one-time diplomat dilated on the partisan politics hampering the creation of new legislation on Capitol Hill, taking a not-so-subtle shot at President Barack Obama's style of governing.

'Obviously, relations with Congress are, on one side of the aisle, pretty poisoned right now,' she told  host Bob Schieffer. 'But also out in the country, the American people don't want to see this divisiveness.

'They want to see the President say, 'I won the election, and now here's where we are going, but we are going together. I recognize that we have differences that may be even deep, but first and foremost we are Americans.''

CBS did not reveal the specifics of Rice's assignment going forward.

New role: Rice embraced her new role Sunday, smiling broadly at host Bob Schieffer's introduction...and then, for good measure, sniping at the president

The network only reportedly said in a widely-circulated statement that the Stanford University professor will 'use her insight and vast experience to explore issues facing America at home and abroad.'

'Everybody knows Condoleezza Rice was President Bush’s Secretary of State but I'm very pleased to announce she has a new job as of today,' host Bob Schieffer said in introducing Rice as a guest on his round-table panel discussion on Sunday.

'As of today, she's joining CBS News as a contributor,' Scheiffer added. 'We're honored to have you.'

Rice, who wore a red dress on the show, smiled broadly as Schieffer introduced her new role, and then seemed to chuckle as he turned the conversation over to her.

Undefined: Rice will reportedly be a 'contributor' for the network, but her duties at CBS were not specifically explained in a widely-circulated statement

'Well, frankly, the first one is a lot more exciting than the second,' Rice said of George W. Bush's first versus his second presidential inauguration.

'I remember being completely taken with the moment (during the first one, but) by the second one, I thought, 'Ya' know I really need to get to work.'

Rice served as National Security Adviser during Bush's first term, and then succeeded Colin Powel as Secretary of State during the 43rd president's final four years in office.

Rice then joked on 'Face the Nation' about the redundancy of officials performing not one - but two - background checks on her at the beginning of both the first and second Bush terms in the White House.

Mixing it up: Rice seemed well at ease on 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, smiling often and broadly and even joking about the redundancy of the background checks performed on her before both Bush's first and second terms

'I remember thinking - because they were actually going out and talking to my neighbors again - and I remember thinking, didn't we just do this four years ago?' she told Schieffer on the show. 'You know what I've been doing for the last four years.'

In March of 2009, Rice reportedly returned to Stanford University -  where she taught prior to joining Bush's White House - as a political science professor.

As of late 2010, she had become a full faculty member of Stanford's business school.
