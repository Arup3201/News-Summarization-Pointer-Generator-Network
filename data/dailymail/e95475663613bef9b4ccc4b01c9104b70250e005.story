A man has been charged with religiously aggravated assault after an attack that left outspoken MP George Galloway with a broken rib.

The Respect Party MP also suffered a badly bruised face after he was assaulted in the street by a man who appeared to have taken exception to his controversial comments about Israel.

Writing in The Mail on Sunday, the politician said he feared for his life when he was attacked in Notting Hill, West London, in broad daylight on Friday.

And he called for police protection in future.

Neil Masterson, 39, of Campden Hill, West London, will appear at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court tomorrow charged with attacking Mr Galloway and a man in his 40s who came to the MP’s aid.

Last night, it emerged that a man of the same name made threats about Mr Galloway on Facebook hours before the incident.

An account in that name carries a series of comments and abusive remarks about Muslims as well as claims that Galloway is anti-Semitic.

The account holder ‘shared’ a picture of the politician, branding him a ‘snake’ and captioned: ‘Galloway is a Hamas and IRA supporter.’

The account holder commented, just hours before the attack: ‘I’d cut his throat myself if I’d dare stoop to the required level.’

He added: ‘Virulent antisemite of the worst kind. Doesn’t even have the gut [sic] to admit it. Drone’

Mr Galloway was posing for photographs when his attacker rushed across the street and assaulted him, swearing and shouting about the Holocaust.

The Bradford West MP received treatment at nearby St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington.

Mr Galloway was interviewed under caution by police earlier this month after he said in a speech that Bradford had been ‘declared an Israel-free zone’ and urged people to reject all Israeli goods, services, academics and tourists.

'I crashed to the ground thinking... this man is going to kick me to death': George Galloway reveals his terror after attack in Notting Hill - and how he led police to suspect

By GEORGE GALLOWAY

I was walking down the street in Notting Hill in broad daylight and getting into my car when two Moroccan guys approached me.

One of them said he was leaving Britain the next day and would love a photo with me for his cafe back home. I stood in the road shaking hands with him as his friend took a picture.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a man powering towards me like a bat out of hell.

He laid into me and was effing and blinding about the Holocaust.

He looked like the type who works out and moved very fast.

He punched me so many times I kept thinking, ‘When is this going to stop?’

But it didn’t. I went into what boxers call ‘peekaboo style’ like American heavyweight Floyd Patterson when he fought Muhammad Ali, covering my face and eyes.

He got frustrated his punches weren’t getting through and kicked me back towards the kerb. I lost my footing and staggered backwards, crashing into a grille on a Moroccan delicatessen I had eaten at a few hours earlier.

I was on the ground thinking ‘this man is going to kick me to death’.

He was so enraged he got on top of me and eventually landed a haymaker right on my jaw. I felt a terrible crack and sickening thud. It went on for about three minutes – a long time when punches are raining down on you. Luckily, the two Moroccan guys pulled him off.

My attacker calmly walked across the road and I drove up the road behind him. I was in a bad way but I was determined he wouldn’t get away with it. I called 999 and described him to police.

He knew I was behind him. I slowed down and the police told me to stop following him. I pulled the car over and saw him go down a side street. While I was talking to the police, he reappeared and walked over to a bus stop.

At this point a police van hurtled round the corner with four police officers in it. Three were women. It was like Cagney and Lacey. I shouted, ‘He is getting on the No 23 bus’ and the police drove into the middle of the road to stop it.

The policewomen bravely piled on to the bus, and brought a man out with handcuffs on.

I have no idea why it happened, though I suspect my attacker was a thug from an extreme Right-wing group. Regardless of his motives, I have no regrets about speaking out on issues like Israel and the Middle East.

We live in a democracy, and as someone who has been elected as an MP on six occasions, I have a right to voice my opinions. And like other politicians who have suffered similar threats and attacks, I am entitled to receive a degree of protection from the State so I can continue to do so.

Even though I have just turned 60 years old, I am slightly ashamed to admit that I didn’t land a single blow. But I am not ready to stop fighting for what I believe in yet.
