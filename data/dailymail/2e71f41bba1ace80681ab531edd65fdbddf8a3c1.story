Aftermath: A suicide bomber detonated a Toyota Corolla loaded with explosives in the middle of a military convoy, injuring at least 20 and killing 7, including two Americans

The attack took place just after 8:00 a.m., when a Toyota Corolla loaded with explosives was driven into a convoy and detonated across from the U.S. embassy in Kabul, according to Agence France-Presse. 

It was rush hour, and dozens of Afghan civilians were caught in the blast.

The 27-year-old captain of Afghanistan's national rugby, Sayed Mustafa Saadat, happened to be nearby. 

'I rushed to help survivors. I picked up a local man who had a broken leg and was badly burnt,' he told AFP.

'I carried him all the way to the hospital, running,' he added. 'It took about 10 minutes, but I don't know if he survived.'

Taliban spokesman Abdulqahar Balkhi said the group was responsible for the attack, tweeting that a 'powerful explosion destroyed 1 military vehicle, killing/wounding a number of American terrorists.'

The same day, Afghan interior minister Mohammad Omar Daudzai was in front of parliament  saying that the past six months in the conflict between NATO-led forces and the Taliban has been the bloodiest.

The New York Times reports that Afghan police have borne the brunt of the violence, with 1,368 killed and 2,370 wounded since March 21, the start of the Afghan calendar year. 

In addition to the American casualties, four Afghans were killed. 

A spokesman in Warsaw said a Polish soldier also died in the blast. The International Security Assistance Force, which is led by NATO, currently has around 300 Polish soldiers in Afghanistan. 

An unresolved presidential vote in June that was plagued by allegations of ballot-rigging has stymied an already weak economy and brought new questions over the long-term stability of Afghanistan as ISAF withdraws combat troops at the end of 2014.
