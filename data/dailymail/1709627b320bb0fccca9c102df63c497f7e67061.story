A prankster posed as a fake chef promoting his new book to trick a series of local TV hosts intro drinking his disgusting concoctions on-air, it was revealed today.

Joe Pickett went on five local talk shows in Illinois and Wisconsin posing as a cookbook author demonstrating his Thanksgiving leftover smoothies and mashed potato ice cream cone among other putrid concoctions--some of which the hosts even tasted.

Now Pickett and his partner Nick Prueher have posted footage of their hilarious gag on the site for their Found Footage Festival, a tour that showcases strange old home video recordings purchased at rummage sales.

Disgusting: Chef Keith Guerke AKA Joe Pickett managed to dupe five local TV stations into inviting him on to do a disgusting (and made up) cooking segment

'Don't forget your cranberry cherry on top': The fake chef's dishes included a mashed potato ice cream cone (left) and a smoothie made with ham, pie and gravy

Pickett posed as Chef Keith Guerke, author of Leftover's Right: Making a Winner of Last Night's Dinner on segments shot for Milwaukee, Rhinelander, and Wausau, and Rockford, Illinois audiences over Thanksgiving and Christmastime last year.

Perhaps most revolting was the leftovers smoothie concoction that featured ham, pie and gravy.

'You can use skim for a heart healthy menu,' said Chef Guerke says.

In one of the smoothie gags, he even managed to get the host to take a drink.

Look of concern: Pickett appeared on five morning shows in Illinois and Wisconsin and while the hosts appeared a little concerned at time, most were perfectly open to his unique concoctions

Read between the lines: Pickett's hat said chef, but his gravy-based-gravy said hilarious gag

She's game: This host even tried his milky pie, ham and mashed potato smoothie

Luckily she didn't end up wearing the smoothie, as well

He got another host to try his 'ants on a leg,' which was a chicken drumstick slathered in mashed potatoes and cranberries.

And for another segment, one the host said was just 'too cute,' he substituted mashed potatoes for ice cream.

'Mashed potatoes: boring, right? how about a mashed potato ice cream cone,' he laughs. 'Put on your corn sprinkles and don't forget your cranberry cherry on top!'

This is not the first time Pickett has tricked local newscasters who've failed to properly vet their guests.

His partner in crime Prueher once went on TV posing as an inept, rapping yo-yo master named K-Strauss.

You can catch them live and in person at one of the upcoming Found Footage Festival tour dates.
