A surefire way to increase your popularity is to give the impression you are already in demand.

Now trouble is brewing over claims that just such a strategy has been used to promote Typhoo tea.

A marketing company is reported to have hired people to pose as customers and contact branches of Sainsbury’s where the brand has been removed from shelves.

Intelligent Marketing Solutions allegedly paid field workers to lobby the supermarket chain to stock the tea via Twitter, Facebook, email, letter or the phone.

The company, which is based in Thame, Oxfordshire, is alleged to have sent an email saying: ‘We have been asked by our client to contact Sainsbury’s by the following methods [email, Facebook etc] to ask why they no longer stock Typhoo tea in a specific store (the stores will be listed) and to ask if this product can be restocked.

‘Rates of pay are £1.50 per call, with the exception of the letter and telephone assignment, which are paid at £2.50.’ 

The email, which was reportedly sent to IMS field workers, did not mention that they should identify themselves as marketing staff.

It added: ‘You will be provided with a Sainsbury’s store for each call, but this may not be a store near you.

'However, because this is an online assignment, this will have no bearing on you conducting this assignment successfully.’

The email did not identify the client, which could be Typhoo tea, another marketing company or simply a wealthy customer who desired its return to the stores.

The campaign was reportedly due to start today, but field workers are believed to have been told over the weekend that it is now on hold.

IMS specialises in field marketing including face-to-face promotion of a product and mystery shopping, which involves its employees going into a store as ordinary consumers and giving feedback.

But there is no mention on its website of a service in which its staff directly contact companies to ask them to stock certain brands. 

Typhoo tea has been steeped in British history since it was launched in Birmingham in 1903 by grocer John Sumner and it was the first brand of tea to be sold pre-packaged rather than loose.

The company is now owned by Apeejay Surrendra Group, one of the largest tea producers in India.IMS and Typhoo were both unavailable for comment yesterday and neither provided a comment when they were contacted by other newspapers last week.

A spokesman for Sainsbury’s said: ‘We always aim to offer our customers a choice and we do stock Typhoo tea in some of our stores.

‘But from time to time we have to remove lines so that we can increase the availability of the products that are the most popular with our customers.’
