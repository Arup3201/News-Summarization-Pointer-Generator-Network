David Cameron’s reshuffle was thrown into chaos last night after it was revealed his new Law Minister was found guilty of professional misconduct after illicitly obtaining case notes from a race-hate trial.

Tory MP Robert Buckland, 45, was censured by a tribunal following his intervention into an enquiry over an attack by 13 Asians on a white pupil at a school where he was governor.

Mr Buckland, appointed Solicitor General last week, last night admitted that he did not tell David Cameron of the charge. His new job includes making sure lawyers do not bring the profession into disrepute – as he was found to have done.

New Solicitor General Robert Buckland was found guilty by the disciplinary tribunal of the barristers’ ruling body, the Council of the Inns of Court

He was found guilty by the disciplinary tribunal of the barristers’ ruling body, the Council of the Inns of Court, which was headed by fellow Tory MPs Kenneth Clarke, the then Justice Secretary, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General until last week. Mr Buckland yesterday faced calls to resign from his new post.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that in 2011 Mr Buckland, a former barrister and part-time judge who has been MP for South Swindon since 2010, was hauled before a disciplinary tribunal of the barristers’ ruling body, after he broke the lawyers’ code of conduct by demanding court documents from a barrister.

The censure of Mr Buckland by the Council of the Inns of Court

The incident occurred in 2008 when Mr Buckland was a governor at Ridgeway School in Wroughton, near Swindon, and had been asked to investigate an attack by an Asian gang – four of whom were pupils – on a white boy at the school.

Henry Webster, then 15, was punched, kicked and hit with a claw hammer and his mother Liz Webster accused the school of being responsible. Thirteen men were later convicted of the attack.

Following this, Mr Buckland, then a prospective MP, told Mrs Webster he was conducting an internal investigation. He also revealed he had asked a fellow barrister, Robin Shellard, who had defended one of the gang, Amjad Qazi, for case notes.

Mrs Webster, however, was horrified at the breach. She said: ‘He was a school governor but if the school had been found guilty of racism that would have affected his career.

‘I think he should resign. I’m amazed he took up the appointment. I don’t see how someone who appears to have so little understanding of the law can take a job which demands this level of moral fibre, this level of responsibility. It’s also outrageous that he didn’t mention that he had this in his past when he took the job. He must have hoped it would all be swept under the carpet.’

Believing Mr Buckland was trying to ‘appease’ her, and furious he was breaching protocol, Mrs Webster told the police at the time.

Mrs Webster said: ‘I had a meeting with Ed Balls who ordered a serious case review of the school, and I also told Michael Gove, the shadow secretary of education. Finally I went to the Bar Council.’

Documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal Mr Buckland was called to a disciplinary hearing on March 31, 2011 to hear and determine the charge of professional misconduct at The Council of the Inns of Court. They state the defendants were found guilty of professional misconduct. Under Particulars of Offence they say: ‘Robert Buckland and Robin Shellard engaged in conduct likely to diminish confidence in the legal profession or the administration of justice or otherwise bring the legal profession into disrepute.’

They state the offence as: ‘Mr Buckland requested Mr Shellard to give him access to, and Mr Shellard agreed to provide access to, the case papers in the criminal trial of Amjad Qasi [sic] and others, the said papers being passed to Mr Buckland when Mr Buckland had no entitlement to be provided with those papers and both parties being aware he was not so entitled at the time.’

Amjad Qazi ,19, was jailed for a year for his part in the vicious attack on  Henry Webster that  left Henry with brain injuries

Mr Buckland’s school investigation never concluded because Mrs Webster launched a civil action against the school for failing to protect her son. She later lost. Last night Mr Buckland, a married father of twins, confessed to The Mail on Sunday that he had failed to notify the Cabinet Office of the misdemeanour. He said: ‘It’s a matter of public record. It’s been recorded by the Bar Standards Board. It happened three years ago.

‘It was a genuine attempt by me to establish facts at the school. This is the only time I have had any issue with the Bar Standards Board. I genuinely thought I was taking the right action for the school. I regret it ended up in the position it did.’

Mr Buckland tried to say the matter was ‘spent’ because more than two years had passed but last night the Bar Standards Board said disciplinary findings stay on a barrister’s disciplinary record indefinitely.

Mr Shellard did not return calls made by The Mail on Sunday.

Last night, a spokesman for the Solicitor General’s office said: ‘This finding was removed from the Bar records after two years and therefore Mr Buckland was not required to declare it upon appointment as Solicitor General.”

But Labour’s Shadow Attorney General, Emily Thornberry, accused Mr Buckland of ‘bad judgement’ for failing to declare the offence. She said: ‘It is very important that the post of Solicitor General is one the Government and the public can have complete trust in.’

Labour last night said ‘we will be raising more questions about this matter’.

Solicitor General and a crime that stunned us all

The Solicitor General’s ‘professional misconduct’ centred on a case where ‘reverse racism’ meant teachers allegedly turned a blind eye to Asian gangs targeting white children at school.

The policy was designed to protect an influx of 20 Asian students whom teachers feared might be bullied when they arrived in 2005. In fact, as was later found by a serious case review, the reverse had taken place at the 1,450-pupil Ridgeway School in suburban Swindon.

Liz Webster, whose son Henry was almost killed in an attack in January 2007, said: ‘Everyone knew what was going on at that school, that there was a culture of racism by the Asian students.

‘There had been a number of incidents. One boy had his nose broken by the same gang that attacked Henry.

‘Police knew about all it. But teachers wouldn’t deal with this reverse racism. They had this perception that the Asian kids were being racially abused when it was the other way around.

‘They created an Asian safe zone at the school and kept claiming the Asian kids were being victimised. There was a fear at the school of being perceived as having a racial problem. They simply didn’t know what to do about it.’

Henry was 15 when, in January 2007, he was set upon by a group of Asian youths who called themselves ‘Asian Invasion’.

Henry had agreed to fight a boy ‘one on one’ to end the harassment he felt he and his friends were experiencing.

Victim: Henry Webster with his mother Liz. Mr Webster was left with brain damage after the attack with a hammer by a gang of Asians

Henry – a 6ft 2ins rugby player who stood out because of his flaming red hair and strong stature – was punched, kicked and hit six times with a claw hammer in a vicious attack by the group that lasted about a minute.

He suffered three skull fractures – the hammer went into the fluid around his brain – and he had surgery to save his life.

Seven young men were convicted of wounding Henry with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm. Five were convicted of conspiracy. Another admitted violent disorder.

They were given custodial sentences ranging from eight months to eight years.

Others received suspended sentences of up to 18 months. Only four were pupils at the school.

The court was told the conflicts at the school resembled something one might see in a Quentin Tarantino movie.

Henry and his family accused the school of failing to discipline Asian pupils who abused or intimidated white classmates. In 2009 his family launched a High Court challenge claiming the school had been negligent, failed to maintain proper discipline or deal with racial tension. The school denied liability.

In February 2010, Mr Justice Nicol rejected the family’s claims and said the school did not breach its duty to take reasonable care to keep Henry reasonably safe while on the premises.

Following that ruling the Swindon Local Safeguarding Children Board commissioned a serious case review. Published in 2010, it found the school had failed to tackle escalating racial tensions between Asian and white teenagers – even after a riot on the playing fields.

It found that not only should playground bullying be monitored for racism, but that schools should appoint ‘different race’ mentors for new pupils to help them settle in. And teachers should consult parents about whether their approaches to religious and cultural requirements are ‘continuously appropriate.’

Mrs Webster, 50, who runs a recruitment agency for domestic staff and nannies maintains that the school was responsible for Henry’s attack. ‘We were never able to see the full serious case review,’ she said. ‘There was something in there the authorities didn’t want me to see.

‘Had the integration of the Asian students been properly handled we are certain this attack would never have happened.’

Henry, 23, is now at university but Mrs Webster says he still suffers ‘fatigue problems’.
