Luis Suarez promises not to waste his chance at Barcelona after the former Liverpool striker 'did not feel like a football player' during the first two months of his ban.

The 27-year-old admits feeling like a 'guest' during his Nou Camp debut  in a friendly against Mexican side Club Leon, and the Uruguay international is glad his punishment for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup is nearest its end.

Suarez could make his competitive bow for Barcelona in the El Clasico against Real Madrid next week, and the forward is eager to help their La Liga campaign.

'I'm not going to waste the opportunity of playing for Barca,' Suarez told the club's official magazine.

'In the 15 minutes of the Gamper Trophy game (against Leon), I felt more like a guest than a (Barcelona) player.

'However, over the last two games I've watched my team-mates and experienced an increased anxiety and desire to play. I want to help and the waiting is almost over.'

When asked about a potential El Clasico debut, Suarez said:Â 'I'm really looking forward to it.

'You never know, but I'm the type of person who thinks everything happens for a reason, so from 19 possible opponents if it's Real Madrid I make my return against then so be it.'

Suarez's appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport restricted the striker's ban to 'official matches only', making him eligible for friendlies.

And the former Anfield star admits being banned from playing for the first two months was what got to him the most.

'Over that period of time I didn't feel like a football player. That was the worst thing because people make mistakes and it's always good to accept them.

'But the most frustrating thing was not feeling like just another member of the squad. That's what hurt me the most.'
