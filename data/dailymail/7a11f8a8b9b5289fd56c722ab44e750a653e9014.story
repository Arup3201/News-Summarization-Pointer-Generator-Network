A heartbroken pet owner has created a bucket list of adventures for her dying dog to make their final months together more memorable.

Lauren Fern Watt, a 25-year-old New Yorker hailing from Brentwood, Tennessee, was devastated to learn that Gizelle, her beloved eight-year-old English Mastiff, had terminal bone cancer six months ago.

'My sobbing seemed unstoppable,’ she wrote for Yahoo Travel. 'This dog wasn’t just my best friend - she was my roommate and confidant.’

Sweet ride: On one excursion, Miss Watt re-created the scene in The Little Mermaid in which Prince Eric chauffeurs Ariel on a rowboat

However, Miss Watt soon realized that she needed to cherish what time she had left with her 160lb best friend, who eventually passed away in early January, and went about creating a list of fun activities for her and her canine companion to enjoy together.

Some of the adventures, such as an early-morning visit to Times Square, took place near Miss Watt's home, while others involved more travel.

At one stage, Miss Watt and her best friend Rebecca took Gizelle for a four-day 'girls only' road trip through New England.

Frozen treat: The pair also enjoyed simple pleasures, such as eating vanilla ice cream together

'We’d take turns sticking our heads out the window, and didn’t worry about work, deadlines, or boys,' she recalled.

She traveled to Well's Beach in Maine, where she picked out two lobsters to cook herself, and fed Gizelle hot buttered lobster chunks with a fork.

The pair had often watched Disney's The Little Mermaid together, and she had the idea to re-create the movie's scene in which Prince Eric chauffeurs Ariel on a rowboat, though she notes that they 'weren't quite as graceful' as the cartoon couple.

Miss Watt wanted to take Gizelle to meet Santa Claus for her final Christmas, but thought that his beard and 'sack full of unpredictable toys' might frighten her, so instead she found a photo-op with some festively dressed pugs.

Final moments: The pair spent the dog's second to last day sitting by the ocean together in Maine earlier this month

While the veterinarian wasn't expecting Gizelle to live past Christmas, the pair spent the dog's second to last day sitting by the ocean together in Maine earlier this month.

Miss Watt, who is now working on a book about her adventures with Gizelle, said that it was a fitting end to their time together. 

'Even in the emptiness of that beach that day, I could see Gizelle running free long the shore, rolling in the sand, awkwardly spooked by approaching waves,' she wrote. 

'I knew she would live on through my experiences, and that I gave her the best life I could.'
