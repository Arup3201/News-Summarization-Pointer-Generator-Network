David Cameron said he was 'not happy' with global firms like Apple not paying enough tax - but accepted an iPad from the firm

David Cameron claims he is not happy about multinational firms like Apple not paying enough tax in Britain – but that has not stopped the Prime Minister from accepting a free iPad from the technology giant.

New details of gifts received by ministers show the PM has kept the freebie for ‘official use’.

Mr Cameron is a known fan of iPad games like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, which have sparked claims that he spends too much time ‘chillaxing’.

Under Whitehall rules, ministers must declare all gifts worth more than £140.

Unless they choose to pay for items out of their own pocket, they are usually stored away by officials.

In 2010, Mr Cameron opted to purchase a £429 iPad given by headphones tycoon Mike Faith, but another tablet from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was kept by the Cabinet Office.

The latest details released for the first quarter of this year show that Mr Cameron received a leather jacket from President Barack Obama during a trip to the US in May, but chose not to purchase it.

He also passed up the opportunity to own unspecified 'sportswear' given by Tory former chancellor Lord Lamont.

But he is known to regularly use an iPad, in part to catch up with TV series such as The Killing while on the move.

After completing Angry Birds, he graduated to Fruit Ninja, in which players slicing straberries, watermelons and pinapples with a samurai sword.

Mr Cameron once said: 'It's quite good, to get your frustration out. If you can't have a reshuffle, play Fruit Ninja.'

However, a special app has reportedly been created to help him keep on top of Government and economic data.

Just yesterday Mr Cameron voiced his unhappiness with the tax affairs of international companies.

In the Commons, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starbucks have between them avoided nearly £900 million of tax.

‘Will the Prime Minister now take this opportunity to condemn their behaviour as morally wrong?’ she asked.

Mr Cameron said Ms Hodge had made ‘an important point’.

He added: ‘This is an international problem that all countries are struggling with: how to make sure that companies pay tax in an appropriate way.

‘I am not happy with the current situation; Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs needs to look at it very carefully.

'We need to make sure that we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country - as they are doing - but they should be paying fair taxes as well.’
