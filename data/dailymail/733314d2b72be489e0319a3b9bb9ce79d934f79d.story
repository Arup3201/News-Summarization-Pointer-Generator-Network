It first appeared on the streets of Ireland as Pope John II navigated his way through crowds of thousands of adoring Catholics during the first ever papal visit to the country.

But the Popemobile that was used to transport the leader of the Catholic Church during the historic visit is set to assume a slightly less spiritual existence - as a venue for stag parties and hen nights.

The 15-seater converted Ford Transit will now be available for hire to the public at a cost of €300-per-hour (£242) plus VAT.

The vehicle, which still contains the original 'Pope's chair', is owned by the Dublin Wax Museum, having sat idle for more than 30 years.

Businessman Paddy Dunning acquired the vehicle when he took over the museum from politician Donnie Cassidy.

A promotional pack for the vehicle's relaunch advertises 'hen and stag [nights]' and 'photo calls', as among its new uses.

The vehicle, which maintains its yellow and white papal facade, will also be used for corporate events.

It has been given a €60,000 makeover, including the addition of a Mercedes chassis. A platform built  at the front of the vehicle so that the pontiff could address onlooking crowds also remains.

Despite the rowdier crowd who might be gearing up to use the vehicle, Mr Dunning said that the museum would be 'selective about who we rent it out to'.

He also told the Irish Times that he wanted to rebrand the vehicle as a 'hopemobile'.

He said: 'I’d like to get a sponsor on board and take it around the country as a ‘hopemobile’.'

'We’d
 like to go around the 32 counties and build a collection of stories of 
local heroes, either business people or local community achievers.'

The businessman revealed that the vehicle is still cherished by Catholics, saying that a group of nuns from Rome visited the Popemobile when it was being kept at his mother's house during renovation.

The Popemobile was built by Ford in Cork before John Paul II's visit in 1979.

During the visit the Polish Pope addressed around one million people in Dublin's Phoenix Park and called for an end to political violence in the country.

The current Popemobile, used by Pope Benedict during his visit to the UK in 2010, is a modified Mercedes-Benz M Class.

It now features bulletproof glass and reinforced side panels and undercarriage after the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981.
