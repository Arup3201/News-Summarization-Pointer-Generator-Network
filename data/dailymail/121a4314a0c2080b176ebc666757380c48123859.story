Police in Massachusetts say a man from France has been arrested after causing a disturbance on a Miami-to-Paris flight.

A
 spokesman for the state police says American Airlines Flight 62 was 
diverted to Boston's Logan International Airport on Wednesday night 
after a passenger became unruly.

The passenger
 was subdued by a federal air marshal while the plane was in the air and
 arrested by state police once the plane landed at about 10 p.m.

Police say 50-year-old Edmund Alexandre, of Paris, was charged with interfering with a flight crew.

He was brought to Massachusetts General Hospital for observation and treatment of a pre-existing medical condition.

Whenever doctors deem him able, he will be arraigned in East Boston District Court.

It could not be determined if he has a lawyer.
