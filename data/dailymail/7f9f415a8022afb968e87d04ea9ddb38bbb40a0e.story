An Iowa Republican congressman turned the tables on his Twitter enemies on Monday, live-reading their insults in a campaign video and responding with a mixture of deadpan looks and delirious laughter.

Steve King, a markedly conservative member of the House whose views draw either applause or eye-rolls – and seldom anything in between – collected some of the meaner tweets about himself and recited them along with his wife Marilyn.

One claimed he 'smells like mothballs and dusty Bibles.' Another called him a 'butthead.'

Biggest laugh: Rep. King's wife Marilyn couldn't contain herself at the idea that the congressman 'smells like mothballs and dusty Bibles'

This tweet from Julia Ioffe, senior editor at The New Republic, came after King argued that racial profiling wasn't an issue in responding to the riots in Ferguson, Missouri 

'Jimmy Kimmel Live' pioneered the concept of having celebrities read angry tweets about them into a camera, including this gem directed at Matthew McConaughey

The two-minute video plays like a take-off on late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's popular 'Celebrities Read Mean Tweets' segment. 

Last month, King tweeted a photo of himself holding his new grandson. A Twitter user called 'duncepud' responded: 'You're garbage. Cheers.'

His insult might have been in response to the budget-hawk King's note that the baby's 'share of national debt = $56,022.'

King, a family-valued Republican, left out the most vulgar Twitter slams. But his deadpan of 'You are a nut job and deserve whatever falls from the sky' is political-Oscar-worthy.

Responding to a tweet that read, 'You are one BAD person... Shame on you!!!' he noted the triple exclamation point and said, 'That's love.'

Julia Ioffe, senior editor of the left-leaning magazine The New Republic, tweeted at King in August: 'Go home, Steve King. You're drunk.'

That message came after King argued that racial profiling wasn't an issue in responding to riots in Ferguson, Missouri – because the rioters 'all appear to be of a single ... continental origin.'

Asked for comment, Ioffe responded with an email reading: 'No!' 

King's wife  guest-stars in his new video, reading and commenting on a few zingers herself.

'Nut job': King's funniest moments come when he deadpans lines that were intended to make him mad

'You are a sad excuse for a human being,' one tweet read. 

'I've been saying that for years,' a laughing Mrs. King responds. 

The congressman took a moment in the video to directly respond to one critic who asked in a tweet, 'How did someone so delusional & anti american get elected to office? Your the problem we have to fix.' 

'"Y-O-U-R," he zings, noting the spelling. 'You're the problem. You're illiterate.' 

King is running for a seventh term in the House of Representatives against Democrat Jim Mowrer, an Iraq War veteran who trailed him by 13 percentage points in a small Loras College polling sample last month.
