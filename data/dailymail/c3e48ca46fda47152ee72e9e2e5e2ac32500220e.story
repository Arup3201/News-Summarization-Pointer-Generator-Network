All work and no play could make Pippa Middleton a dull girl, so after attending a charity event this week party-mad Pippa chose to let her hair down at one of London's leading restaurants.

Her handsome date Tom Kingston is a regular part of Pippa's social set and the two dined at French restaurant Le caprice in the city's ritzy Mayfair area.

29-year-old Pippa wore her favourite skinny jeans with a fitted £295 navy blazer and round-toed navy court shoes.

The crepe blazer by British brand Beulah London featured satin detail on the lapels, cuffs, buttons and back and brunette Pippa finished the look with an electric blue mock-croc clutch bag and simple sapphire necklace.

Blonde banker Tom and Pippa are said to have met through mutual friends.

The Bristol graduate is often described as one of London society's most eligible men.

A friend of Pippa's recently told the Daily Mail's Richard Kay, 'Tom is utterly charming, polite and very popular with the ladies. In fact, he is just the kind of guy you would want to introduce to your mother.'

34-year-old Tom accompanied Pippa to the Cheltenham races recently where the two delighted in a flurry of wins on the horses.

Le Caprice, sister restaurant to 
celebrated venue The Ivy, is located just behind the Ritz hotel and its fancy French menu is hugely popular with stars and well-heeled Londoners.

Earlier this week Pippa attended the opening of a £2million charity project at the Mary Hare School for deaf children in Berkshire.

The author became an ambassador to the school after being introduced to their work through a friend.

The  Mary Hare School is a charity for profoundly and severely deaf children and young people from all over the country.

Pippa said: 'It gives me great pleasure to be a supporter of Mary Hare and make a difference to the lives of deaf children. I wanted to help out, because this is a local charity close to my family's home and I have been charmed by the inspiring children that attend, not least for their charismatic and heart-warming attitude to life.'
