The great and the good of the media and technology world have jetted into the picturesque Idahoan mountain resort of Sun Valley for the annual Allen & Company conference, where champagne sipping and deal-making are the order of the day.

The airport 'parking lot' was congested with private and corporate aircraft as movers and shakers on such as Rupert Murdoch, Google’s Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Intel’s Brian Krzanich, eBay’s John Donahoe, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Twitter's Dick Costolo, LinkedIn's Jeff Weiner and AOL's Tim Armstrong flew in for the exclusive affair, which is largely closed to media.

It’s likely that the seeds of several major mergers will be sown at Sun Valley, with Murdoch, the CEO of News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, the world’s second biggest media company, rumoured to be considering a buyout of Time Warner.
