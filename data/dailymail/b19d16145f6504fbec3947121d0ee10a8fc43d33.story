A teacher who cannot walk has refused to let his condition get the better of him and is delivering lessons from home - via Skype.

Mark Ellis underwent a knee operation a fortnight ago but despite not being able to get into school he has continued to work – using a webcam.

The English teacher, who cannot move as a result of the surgery, has taken to the web so he can continue his lessons, teaching from the comfort of his own study.

Mr Ellis broadcasts his lessons live using a webcam and Skype, and his face is beamed on to the whiteboard to ensure his pupils do not miss out.

'This is much better than me not being there at all by a long way,' Mr Ellis said.

'So this is a way of making sure we don't lose momentum at the beginning of the year.

'I had a cartilage operation on the Friday before term started and I simply can't go into work but I am fully fit so this just seems to be the best of way of doing things.'

'I can see them and they can see me so we are carrying on the best we can without me actually being there,'  said Mr Ellis who teaches English

He added that the 'brilliant' IT expert Kevin Stacey at Newent Community School and Sixth Form Centre, Glos., had geared up equipment to allow the space-age teaching.

'I can see them and they can see me so we are carrying on the best we can without me actually being there,' he said.

'We have been pushing the boundaries with Mr Stacey but he is so skilful at this sort of thing which comes easy to him and it is something we like to try and do.

'I want the pupils to feel confident that I am not abandoning them and that this is an early part of the school year and we really need to get on that train to the A-levels.

'You can usually get a teacher in for Key Stages three and four in the absence of staff members but otherwise the sixth form would be left to work at my guidance.

'But doing this through Skype is face to face and has the ebb and flow of a normal lesson.'

Mr Ellis has been conducting lessons on Shakespeare's Hamlet and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy and hopes to be back in school by next Monday.
