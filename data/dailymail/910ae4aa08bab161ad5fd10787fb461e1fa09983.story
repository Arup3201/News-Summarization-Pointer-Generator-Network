A father was stabbed by a farmer in a dispute over a pet poodle.

Gavin Watson, 30, confronted Michael Turford after being told he had manhandled his daughter’s dog Lola.

But Turford drew a knife on the builder and plunged it three times into his chest.

Gavin Watson was stabbed three times by farmer Michael Turford after Mr Watson confronted him about manhandling his daughter's pet dog, a poodle cross called Lola, at a holiday park they were at in Yorkshire 

The 32-year-old was jailed for seven years at York Crown Court on Monday after a jury convicted him of wounding with intent at the end of a week-long trial.

The incident happened while Mr Watson was on a camping holiday with wife Kelly, 29, and children Madelaine, 11, and Harry, seven.

They left Lola in their tent when they went on a car trip but the spaniel cross-breed escaped and found its way to the campsite’s clubhouse. 

Turford, who lived across the road and was in the building, took it on himself to throw the dog out.

Mr Watson had been on holiday with his family including (from left to right) his father Steve Watson, mother Janet Watson and wife Kelly Watson, as well as their two children Harry (front left) and Madelaine (front right)

When Mr Watson heard what had happened he tracked Turford to a nearby pub to demand an explanation, which was not forthcoming. 

Nicholas Barker, prosecuting, said Mr Watson was leaving the pub when Turford, following behind, struck with his knife.

Mr Watson fought back but was stabbed twice more. Turford fled and was arrested the next morning – April 21 last year.

Peter Makepeace, defending, claimed Turford acted in self-defence but the jury agreed with the prosecution that the farmer made the first move.

Mr Watson said he thought he was going to die 

 After sentencing, Mr Watson, from Belper, Derbyshire, said: ‘I was told that he had thrown Lola at a wall or floor.

My daughter was devastated because it was her dog and she was really upset.’

He said he thought the first blow from Turford’s knife was a punch.

‘As soon as I realised he stabbed me, he was coming at me with a knife again,’ he added.

‘He stabbed me in the guts, just above the spleen and close to my lungs right near my heart.

‘Doctors told me that I was lucky that I didn’t die because the wounds were so close to my organs.’

Mr Watson was driven from the pub back to the York House campsite in Hawkser, near Whitby, north Yorkshire from where an ambulance took him to hospital. 

He has made a full recovery.

Detective Sergeant Ash Khan, of North Yorkshire Police’s major crimes unit, said: ‘This case demonstrates the dangers and consequences of people carrying a knife and hopefully Michael Turford will use his time in prison to reflect on his actions.’ 

Turford was cleared on a charge of attempted murder.
