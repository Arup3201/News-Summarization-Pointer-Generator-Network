A mother has admitted pulling off her baby daughter’s finger and toe nails in an horrific year-long campaign of abuse.

The 26 year-old began hurting the child when she was just six months old.

Suspicions were first aroused when the child’s GP noticed the injuries to her nails in August 2010.

The mother initially claimed her baby was suffering from infected nails, but doctors found there was no medical cause for the injuries.

The woman, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. was arrested and charged with wounding with intent.

She was due to stand trial later this year, but changed her plea to guilty on Monday at Peterborough Crown Court.

The woman spoke only to confirm her name and whisper her plea of 'guilty'.

The court ruled that the woman cannot be named in the media to protect the identity of her child, who was taken into care in 2011.

Graham Huston, defending, asked for the case to be adjourned for psychiatric and pre-sentence reports.

He said he had concerns about the defendant’s mental health and had asked for time for expert reports to consider the defence of criminal insanity.

Judge Patrick O’Brien ordered the reports be carried out after granting the young mother bail.

He said: 'The granting of bail is no indication of sentence, and it could be a custodial sentence.

'However, a mental health order is also a possible outcome of the case.'

Sentencing will take place at Cambridge Crown Court on May 14.
