Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback has pulled out of the England squad and will miss Monday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland through injury, manager Roy Hodgson has announced.

Colback was unable to feature in Wednesday's 1-0 over Norway after receiving a kick on the calf in training on the eve of the game and the uncapped midfielder has now been sent back to Newcastle for treatment.

As a result he will not be able to take part in Monday's game in Basle.

'Jack Colback has had to leave us,' the England manager said.

'He took a very nasty kick on the back of the calf.

'We were hoping he would train with us, but he can't do that, so it's better to send him back to Newcastle.'
