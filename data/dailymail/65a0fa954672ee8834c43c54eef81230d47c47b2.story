Theses are the first heartbreaking photos to emerge of Alanna Gallagher, the little six-year-old girl found horrifically stripped, bound and and murdered in a quiet suburban Fort Worth neighborhood.

The photos reveal an adorable child with no shortage of smiles for the camera. Neighbors said she was an inquisitive 'spitfire' who always seemed to have questions that betrayed an intellect beyond her young age. 

Alanna's body was found wrapped in a tarp a mile and a half from her home in Saginaw, Texas, on Monday night. She her hands and feet were bound, she had a plastic bag over her head and she was naked except for a pair of purple underwear.

Police on Wednesday announced that the FBI has offered a $10,000 reward for anyone who helps them find the monster who abducted Alanna from her parents' house.

At a news conference, police spokesman
 Damon Ing said investigators are tracking down several leads and have 
already received numerous tips about the disappearance of little Alanna -
 but they need to public's help to find her killer.

Alanna's parents have been ruled out as suspects in the case, Ing said. 
Her mother and father have been meeting with police chaplains and grief 
counselors since their daughter disappeared Monday night.

Investigators say they are trying to figure out exactly when Alanna was taken from her home. Her body was found about 7.30pm about a mile and a half from her parents' house.

They are also still searching for a red pickup truck with a green splotch that could be involved in the her murder.

Saginaw police have set up to 24-hour tip lines for the public to leave potential information about the case. The phone numbers are 682-888-3682 and 682-888-3684.More than 100 people showed up for a 
candle-light vigil at a nearby Methodist church Tuesday night to pray 
for little Alanna. Residents also started a make-shift memorial on a 
curb near where her body was found. By Tuesday night, the line of 
stuffed animals, flowers and cards stretched half the block.

Neighbors say the inquisitive girl with 'curly brown hair and a constant smile' loved to play alone outside in her front yard - but was cautious to always tell strangers they had to keep away.

Neighbors said Alanna always seemed far smarter than other children her age and always seemed to ask mature questions

Searching: Police executed a search warrant on the girl's parents' home following her murder. The house is located about a mile and a half from where the body was found

'She seemed smarter than the average (child her age), just because of the questions she’d always ask,' neighbor John Janus told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

'And
 her parents are nice and very, very smart people. They like books. The 
last time I was in their home, the front room looked like a library.'

Mr Janus said he took his children with Alanna and her father on Halloween for the last few years.

According to his Facebook page, Alanna's father Karl Gallagher graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and works as an engineer for a defense contractor. He posted dozens of pictures of his three children on his Facebook page.

'She was a precious little girl. I usually just saw her on her scooter,' neighbor Kay Stief told the Dallas Morning News.

Many neighbors say they often saw her playing alone - either in her yard or on the neighborhood streets near her house. However, in the quiet suburban neighborhood, they said they usually didn't think too much of it.

Police and the FBI searched the girl's home for several hours on Tuesday, carrying out boxes of documents and computers.

A police spokesman said they were 
interviewing the parents - though at they moment they were only trying 
to confirm the timeline of when the girl was abducted from her home.

The
 girl's body was found about 7.30pm on Monday by 14-year-old Owen 
Whiddon, who was riding his scooter through his neighborhood in Saginaw -
 about a mile and a half from where the girl lived.

He said he saw a tarp in the middle of an intersection, tightly rapped with a belt.

'I
 said, "Well, let’s pick it up, let’s put it in the trash can," you 
know, because we’re a clean community,' he told the Morning News.

What he found shocked him to his core. He ran back home and told his mother: 'Mom, it’s a little girl.'

Whiddon's friend Josh Smith, 18, told KXAS-TV that he is will never be the same after seeing the girl dead.

'At first, I just thought it was some 
rubber stuff at first, and then I got a closer look and all I saw was a 
bag and I saw some hair sticking out and so, I was like, "Oh my God! 
It’s a girl!"' he said.

'And that’s when I dropped to my knees and just started crying.'

The girl's body was found in Saginaw, Texas, a city of 20,000 outside Forth Worth

Coping: Neighbors quickly set up a makeshift memorial on the curb for the little girl. It was torched along with the family's car Friday

Katie Whiddon, Owen's mother, told KTVT-TV that she didn't believe her son at first. When he convinced her he was telling the truth, she called 911.

'I was panicking. I was freaked out. 
How can somebody hurt a little girl?' she said.

Ms Whiddon told KDFW-TV
 that the girl was naked except for a bear of purple underwear and her 
hands and feet were bound. She had a plastic grocery bag over her head.

Police
 say they are still not sure when the girl's body was dumped. Some 
neighbors said they noticed the tarp in the road about noon. Others say 
they didn't see it until about 7pm.

Neighbors
 said her father started looking for her about 9pm Tuesday - an hour and
 a half after he body was found. They recalled him going door-to-door 
asking if anyone had seen his daughter.

'You could tell on his face, he didn’t know what to do,' Mr Janus, the neighbor, told the Star-Telegram.

'It was like he was in shock and that he didn’t know where else to look.'

Another
 neighbor, Derinda, told the Morning News that she saw Alanna's mother 
around that time, too. The neighbor said she didn't seem very worried 
about her daughter.

Derinda recalls the mother saying: 'I bet she’s over at a neighbor’s home. She always does this.'

About
 9.15pm, Mr Janus said he saw Alanna's father walk over to two police 
cruisers that had parked on his street. He believes that is when the 
parents reported their young daughter missing.

Alanna's two other siblings are staying with family friends while their parents are being questioned by police.

Neighbors say they noticed a red 
pickup truck with a green splotch on the rear passenger-side panel in 
the neighborhood shortly before the body was found.

Investigators
 believe the driver may have something to do with the body and have 
asked anyone with information about the truck to come forward.
