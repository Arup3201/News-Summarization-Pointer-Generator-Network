Hundreds of padlocks left by couples as love tokens are to be removed from a metal bridge – in case it becomes unsafe.

In a craze taking hold in cities across the world, lovers attach a lock to a bridge’s railings and throw away the key as a symbol of their love.

Over the years, couples have put more than 330 'love locks' - bearing their names and romantic messages - on the Queen's Park Suspension Bridge in Chester.

More than 330 'love locks' have been attached to Queen's Park Suspension Bridge in Chester in recent years

But the council’s structural engineers say it is now 'close to its theoretical capacity for wind loading' and the locks must be removed to protect the public.

The news comes after an incident in Paris which saw tourists evacuated from the Pont des Arts across the Seine after pieces of the parapet crumbled away under the weight of metal love tokens.

The bridge was immediately closed to the public and was quickly repaired and reopened.

A five-feet long section of metal mesh fell inwards onto the bridge itself and officials said the design of the bridge made it impossible for debris to fall onto pleasure boats and barges on the River Seine. 

Workers at Cheshire West and Chester Council (CWaC) will begin removing the locks next month, when the newly-refurbished bridge is also due to be resurfaced.

Councillor Lynn Riley, executive member for localities, said: 'We’ve taken the logical decision to act before there’s any danger to the public.

'At the same time, we’re doing the best that circumstances allow to respect the sensitivities of those who attached the locks and may want to have them back as a keepsake.'

Queen's Park councillor Neil Sullivan added: 'The Queen's Park Suspension Bridge is a handsome structure in its own right which, to be fair, has just cost our council taxpayers a tidy sum to refurbish.

'While appreciating the romantic significance of the locks, many residents don’t believe they enhance the appearance of the bridge, particularly when they damage its new paintwork when moved around by the wind.'

Owners who still have keys will have at least three weeks to reclaim them.

After removal by the council, the remainder will be stored locally until the end of the year.

Tokens of everlasting love and commitment, 'love locks' have appeared in cities around the world - particularly Europe - with lovers locking their love and throwing away the key.

The craze is such that companies manufacture them in especially bright colours and even gold or silver plate.

Their true origin is uncertain but is thought to be either China or Serbia.
