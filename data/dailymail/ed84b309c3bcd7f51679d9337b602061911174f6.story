A health and safety expert knocked a teenage girl off her moped before speeding off, leaving her in the road to be run over and killed by an oncoming minibus, a court heard today.

Jade Clark's scooter was 'swallowed up and fragmented into hundreds of pieces' by Brian Hampton's Volvo 4X4 after he ploughed into the back of it.

The executive swerved around the 16-year-old after she was flung into a Hampshire dual carriageway, before she was hit by a Volkswagen minibus whose driver had no time to react.

Hampton, 58, an engineer who checks the safety of signals on Britain's railways, fled the scene and then tried to cover up his part in the teenager's death, the prosecution say.

Road death: Jade Clark. 16, was killed after Brian Hampton, sketched in court, hit her with his 4X4 before she was run over and killed by a minibus, a court heard

Debris: The shattered remains of Jade's moped after a crash the prosecution say was caused by Hampton who then fled

Bournemouth Crown Court heard Hampton, who was already banned from driving, told his wife, his employers, a car garage and the police his £40,000 Volvo had struck a deer.

Hampton paid £4,300 for the damage to the front of his vehicle to be hastily repaired, a jury was told.

The court heard Hampton struck Jade's scooter as he drove along the A31 in Ringwood, Hampshire, on February 24.

Chain of events: Jade was knocked into the road and died instantly from severe head injuries when a minibus followed

Simon Jones, prosecuting, said: 'Jade fell into the middle of the carriageway and the defendant swerved around her. That left her exposed to the fast moving traffic.

'Her moped was swallowed up and pushed along the carriageway.'

Mr Jones said motorist John Ward was driving a VW minibus and had no time to react before hitting Jade, a trainee hairdresser from Ringwood in the New Forest.

He added: 'He drove over what he initially believed to be debris and caused catastrophic head injuries and instant death.

'The moped was fragmented into hundreds of pieces.

'Brian Hampton had already driven off effectively leaving Jade and the scene of a fatal road collision.

'It was his duty to stop.

'What the defendant did was to seek to evade justice and pervert the course of justice by arranging for the damage to his vehicle to be subsequently repaired.

'He did this with one purpose in mind - that being to ensure there could be no link between him, his vehicle and the collision that occurred on the A31 that day.' 

Case: Brian Hampton is on trial for perverting the course of justice after allegedly lying to cover up his part in the crash

Hampton drove his damaged vehicle to the Premier Inn in Poole where he had been booked in by his employers, railway company Signalling Solutions, the court heard.

He emailed his manager at 4am the following day saying he couldn't attend work because he had swollen feet.

He then told his wife Maureen that his car had broken down and he had to wait several days for a recovery truck to tow it back to his home in Kent, it is alleged.

But later that day he secretly drove to Ashford near his home town of Shadoxhurst where he took his car to a garage then stayed in a nearby Holiday Inn for two nights, the jury heard.

Hampton is said to have told the body shop he had hit a deer, then spent £4,300 getting the Volvo fixed.

Grief: Jade Clark's mother Sharon Clark is comforted by her husband Daniel Clark during a press conference at the time of her death

Mechanics replaced the car's bonnet, grill, radiator, sump shield, bumper and number plate but raised concerns because there had been no blood or fur on the car.

When officers swooped on his home on March 21, Hampton told them he had no idea why he was being arrested.

He told police that on the night Jade died he had been visiting his daughter in Poole but had arrived too late so had bought fish and chips then booked into a hotel.

He said no incidents had taken place and he had not had any repair work done to his car.

In a second interview he conceded the car had been repaired but said he had no clue as to how the damage had occurred.

Mr Jones said a series of CCTV images of Hampton's car prior to the incident showed the grill trim in tact, while photos taken after showed it damaged.

Hampton was also caught on camera checking the front of his vehicle at the Premier Inn in Poole, and told staff when he left that he couldn't get the bonnet open.

Mr Jones said: 'There can be no other credible explanation for the repair other than for this defendant to distance himself from the collision and subsequent detection of his involvement.'

Hampton previously pleaded guilty to separate charges of causing death by careless driving, driving while disqualified and without insurance on February 24 and 25, the jury was told.

He denies the charge of perverting the course of justice by arranging for the repair of the collision damage, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident.

The trial at Bournemouth Crown Court continues.
