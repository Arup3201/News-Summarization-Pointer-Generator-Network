A drug smuggler pretended to be running a legitimate pharmaceuticals business while funding a lavish lifestyle trafficking narcotics from around the world.  

Damon Bolderson and his wife Paula, who had previously declared bankruptcy and lived off benefits, were able to spend thousands of pounds on exotic holidays, home furnishings and cosmetic surgery. 

But the pair have now been sentenced to years in jail after their smuggling operation was brought down, and could be forced to repay their ill-gotten gains.

Haul: Police found bags full of party drugs and cutting agents during a search of the couple's home

Before being caught, the Boldersons paid off the £140,000 mortgage on their suburban semi-detached home, bought a luxury caravan and furnished their house with gaming machines and a hot tub.  

They also spent £10,000 on a family holiday in the Mexican resort of Cancun, while Mrs Bolderson, 38, underwent a cosmetic surgery including Botox, lip fillers and tummy tucks.  

Mr Bolderson, 42, owned a black Range Rover which he nicknamed 'The Beast', and collected celebrity autographs and memorabilia.  

However, in April 2011 police investigating organised crime arrested the couple during a raid on their home in Stoke-on-Trent.  

They recovered 326kg of benzocaine, which is used to dilute drugs such as cocaine, worth £67,000, as well as £90,000 in cash - some of which was hidden in a handbag which had been stashed in a wardrobe.  

Home: Police raided the Boldersons' house in Stoke-on-Trent in April 2011 and found drugs

Car: The black Range Rover which Mr Bolderson nicknamed 'The Beast', bought with the proceeds of crime

Package: Border officials intercepted cutting agents sent to the Boldersons' home from China

Among the designer drugs found at the home were 130,000 'party drug' pills, 12kg of class C drug TFMPP and 5kg of BZP, imported from China, Hong Kong and Pakistan and worth more than £300,000.  

The Boldersons had tried to hide their deliveries and payments in small packages and DVD cases.  

At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday, Mr Bolderson was jailed for eight years and Mrs Bolderson for four years, after pleading guilty to possessing drugs with intent to supply.  

Mr Bolderson used a pharmaceuticals firm, Global Medical Healthcare Products, to hide his buying and selling of chemicals such as benzocaine.   

Collector: Mr Bolderson spent  money on memorabilia such as this football shirt signed by Joe Cole

Signature: A cookbook signed by celebrity chef Gino D'Acampo was found at the couple's home

Fan: An Everton away shirt signed by players such as goalkeeper Neville Southall owned by Mr Bolderson

He set up a website which advertised the company as 'importers, exporters and suppliers of high branded products for the pharmaceutical industry'. 

The site claimed to be 'one of the leading pharmaceutical importers, exporters and suppliers of high branded products to the pharmaceutical industry' and boasted to be 'committed to supplying pharmacies and wholesalers with the highest quality branded and generic pharmaceutical products at the most competitive prices.' 

Mr Bolderson used fraudulent document to secure certificates from the Medical Health Regulatory Authority, and claimed on his website: 'We follow all applicable laws, supplying only quality products that are maintained and shipped under stringent guidelines and controls to ensure quality delivery, free from error or defect.'  

Officers from the UK Border Agency intercepted four packages of benzocaine and lignocaine sent to the Boldersons' home from China between October 2010 and March 2011, as well as emails Mr Bolderson sent to his clients in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S.  

Drug: The Boldersons had substances used to dilute cocaine as well as designer drugs

International: Mr Bolderson had clients in the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. as well as within Britain

Operation: Police raided their home after receiving a tip-off from the UK Border Agency

Antony Longworth, defending Mr Bolderson, said: 'He saw the opportunity of relatively easy money and took it. He made considerable profits in a short time.'  

Mrs Bolderson's lawyer Stuart Muldoon added: 'Her husband was the driving force.'  

But judge David Fletcher told her: 'You were not naive when in Cancun enjoying an expensive holiday, knowing your husband had bought your house in cash only two years after he had been adjudicated bankrupt and when on benefits.'  

Today Dave Hughes of Staffordshire Police said: 'The Boldersons were a seemingly normal couple but behind the facade of their unassuming home, they were in fact running an international drug trafficking business which was making them thousands.  

'While Damon was the company executive, his wife acted as the company secretary and was fully aware of the illegal nature of the business.  

Lifestyle: The pair paid off the mortgage on their home, pictured, and bought a holiday caravan

Kitchen: The Boldersons now face the prospect of having their assets confiscated by the authorities

Garden: The couple lived an unassuming suburban life, including claiming benefits, before the smuggling

'During our investigation we were not able to find any financial accounts or documentation to explain the business and a large amount of cash was recovered from the couple's home. It quickly became apparent that their pharmaceutical business was simply a cover for their criminal activity.  

'We believe the drugs obtained by the Boldersons were headed for both local and international customers, including the benzocaine which was destined to dilute cocaine, increasing its profit margin on the streets.  

'There is no doubt that our intervention and disruption of this activity will have a knock on affect on cocaine dealers' business, as they simply cannot operate without this cutting agent.  

'It is also a stark warning to those who use or maybe considering using drugs - you simply don't know what you're taking or where it has come from. The dangers are unavoidable and it's simply not worth the risk.'
