Nemanja Matic is clear to give Chelsea an inspirational team-talk before today’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham — despite the fact that he is suspended for the match.

Jose Mourinho encourages a different player to give the final team-talk before each game and has considered using Matic, who is suspended for the final after being sent off against Burnley last week.

The Chelsea boss was unclear whether Matic would be allowed in the dressing room before the final but FA disciplinary rules do not bar a suspended player from being anywhere other than on the pitch.

This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Matic who was sent off for his reaction last week

Matic's furious reaction earned him a three-match ban that was later reduced to two games by the FA

Mourinho said: ‘I don’t even know if Matic is allowed to go to the dressing room after the “crime” he committed. I don’t know if he is allowed to go into the dressing room. I don’t know if he’s allowed to go to Wembley.’

Mourinho admitted that Matic’s ban, for retaliating after an awful tackle by Ashley Barnes, has left him disappointed with English football. 

Asked whether his feelings about English football had changed, Mourinho said: ‘Good question. I would not change my feelings about it. But in this moment, I’m a bit disappointed, yes.’
