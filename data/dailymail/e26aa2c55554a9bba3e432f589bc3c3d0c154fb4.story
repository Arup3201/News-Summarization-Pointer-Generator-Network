A loyal dog watched over his dead four-legged friend overnight in sub-zero temperatures after the other dog was run over by a car.

The small white dog was killed in the middle of a busy street in the city of Yinchuan in north west China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, when he was hit by an unknown car.

Despite temperatures dropping to a chilly -13C another sandy-coloured dog stayed by the animal's side overnight, guarding the body as it lay in the road.

Kind: Eventually restaurant workers removed the dead dog's body, and buried it under a tree in a nearby park

A woman called Ma Hongyan told Sky 
News: 'It is our stool. A kind-hearted woman put it next to the dogs to 
protect them from being hit again by another car.'

Eventually restaurant workers removed the dead dog's body, and buried it under a tree in a nearby park.

They were followed along the route by the other dog, who stayed with the workers until his friend had been buried.
