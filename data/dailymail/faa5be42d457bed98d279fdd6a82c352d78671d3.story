A Montana woman who was due to be sentenced on Thursday for pushing her new husband to his death in Glacier National Park wants to withdraw her guilty plea to a second-degree murder charge.

Jordan Linn Graham, 22, wants the change because prosecutors are still recommending life in prison, even though second-degree murder would normally carry a lesser sentence.

Her defense attorney Michael Donahoe said in a motion that her ‘extremely reckless but unintentional act’ only warranted 10 years in prison.

New plea: Jordan Graham wants to withdraw her guilty plea as she 'unintentionally' pushed her husband off a cliff days after their wedding

Donahoe said the request for a life 
sentence shows that prosecutors' offer to dismiss the first-degree murder 
charge was an ‘empty promise’ and a way to avoid a possible verdict of 
manslaughter - a less serious offense than first or second degree 
murder.

The plea agreement was reached in December after the trial testimony was complete but before closing arguments were held.

Graham, of Kalispell, was charged with killing Cody Johnson on July 7, eight days after the two married.

Johnson's body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker.

Graham
 said at her trial that she was having second thoughts about being 
married so young and they went to the park to talk about it.

They went over a 
retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky,
 steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred
 feet to a ravine.

There,
 facing the void, she told Johnson that she wasn't really happy and that
 she was not feeling like she believed she ought to be married,
 she said.

They
 argued. It escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham 
said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that's when 
she became angry.

'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.'

She
 said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one
 hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over.

It
 wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an 
extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car 
was parked. She had the keys in her pocket.

She drove back home to Kalispell, about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened.

'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said.

She
 didn't tell anybody what had happened, instead making up a story that 
Johnson had gone for a ‘joyride’ with friends from Washington state.

That story unraveled when the versions she told to friends, relatives and authorities didn't match.
