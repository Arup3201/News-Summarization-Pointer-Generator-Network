Police had 'three contacts' with suspect Elliot Rodger before a mass shooting on Friday night in Isla Vista that left seven dead and thirteen injured. 

Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said on Saturday that police had conducted a 'welfare check' on 22-year-old Rodger on April 30.

Police spokeswoman Kelly Hoover has said the wellness check will be reviewed as authorities continue their investigation.

'Retribution': Elliot Rodger posted a video to social media in which he outlined his plan for 'retribution' for being rejected by women

On January 15, 2014, Rodger made a citizen's arrest when his roommate allegedly
 stole three candles from him worth $22, Brown said.

Rodger also
 called police on July 31, 2013 and claimed to be the victim of assault,
 Brown said, though police believe Rodger may have actually been the aggressor. No charges were filed.

Attorney Alan Shifman earlier told reporters that the Rodger family called police several weeks ago after being alarmed by YouTube videos 'regarding suicide and the killing of people' that Rodger had been posting.

Police interviewed Rodger and found him to be a 'perfectly polite, kind and wonderful human,' but noted that he had few friends and no girlfriend, he added. Police did not find a history of guns.

Rodger downplayed his family's concerns for his mental state, saying he was having difficulties with his social life and was planning to drop out of Santa Barbara City College.

The responding deputies gave him some advice and information on where to seek help, and left.

In a 140-page manifesto, Rodger described in detail the day police knocked his door.

'I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it,' he wrote.

The 22-year-old expressed fear that officers would search his home and find his multiple firearms and writings outlining his plans, and stop him from exacting revenge n his 'enemies' by locking him up.

The officers, however, found the suspect ‘courteous and shy,’ and left.

Rodger allegedly stabbed his three 
roommates before he went on a shooting spree in his BMW and killed six people and injuring thirteen. He was found dead due to a gunshot wound in his vehicle. 

He is reportedly the son of Peter Rodger, who was an assistant director for The Hunger Games.

The day before the shooting, Rodger shared a video on YouTube which detailed plans for a 'day of retribution.'

'Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity,' Rodger says in the video. 'Against all of you. For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. All because girls have never been attracted to me.'

'I will punish all of you for it,' he later says in the video before laughing.  'On the day of retribution, I am going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB and I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up blond slut I see inside there. All those girls that I’ve desired so much. They would have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man if I ever made a sexual advance towards them. While they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes.'

Later in the video, Rodger goes on to describe himself as 'the superior one' and 'the true alpha male.'
