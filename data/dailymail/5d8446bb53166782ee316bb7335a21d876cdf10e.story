Brighton & Hove Albion have confirmed the appointment of Chris Hughton as their new manager.

Former Newcastle United and Norwich City boss Hughton has been given a three-and-a-half year contract to replace Sami Hyypia, who left the club last week. 

Caretaker Nathan Jones is expected to stay on, either as the new man's assistant or first team coach at Brighton.

Chairman Tony Bloom told the club's website: 'Chris has an excellent record in coaching and management. He's hugely respected, both nationally and internationally, and he has great contacts within the game.

'He is someone who has a real wealth of experience in the top two divisions, from nearly 15 years at Spurs as a coach, assistant and interim manager, through to his more recent work in the Premier League and Championship.

'Chris is also a manager who has a track record for developing talent at all levels from academy upwards and will embrace the work we've been doing at the club in this area in recent seasons.

'Importantly, we also felt Chris is someone who can improve our immediate situation, while also having the management credentials and skills to plan our long-term future and help us to get back to progressing in the way we have in previous seasons.'

Hughton has a good record in the Championship and led Newcastle to promotion to the Premier League in 2010. He also guided Birmingham to the play-offs two years later.

His first match will be against Brentford at Griffin Park on Saturday in the FA Cup third round.
