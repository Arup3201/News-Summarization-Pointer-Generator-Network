Vijay Mallya has insisted the current difficulties he and fellow co-owner Subrata Roy are facing is having no impact on their running of Force India.

At the start of the month Mallya was declared a 'wilful defaulter' by the United Bank of India due to non-payment of debts owed by his now grounded Kingfisher Airlines.

A wilful defaulter is unable to borrow money from other financial institutions, could lose directorial posts in other companies, and potentially faces criminal proceedings for recovery of any debts.

Roy, head of the Sahara conglomerate of businesses, is involved in a long-running dispute over his group's failure to repay billions of pounds to investors who were sold seemingly illegal bonds.

Roy is currently imprisoned and working from a makeshift office in jail after failing to appear at a contempt hearing earlier this year.

Speaking on the issues, Mallya said: 'Sahara Group have problems relating to funds raised from the public which the Securities and Exchange Board of India have determined were not raised as per regulations and need to be refunded.

'Sahara claims the investors have been refunded and provided the necessary proof of refund to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

'They don't seem to be able to verify the facts provided by Sahara.

'The agreement between Sahara and myself is they're shareholders in the team, they continue to be shareholders in the team.

'I have asked them if they would like to change the situation and they said no, they want to stay in.'

With regard to Mallya's position and the Silverstone-based marque, he added: 'As far as my situation is concerned, I'm not a borrower, I have not borrowed any money from any bank.

'Therefore all you read about may contain my name, but has to do with one of our companies, which is Kingfisher Airlines.

'If you continue to refer to me in my personal capacity, it conveys the wrong impression I'm a debtor in a sense, which I'm not.

'I've always run and managed the team which is doing better than it ever has in its history, and we're going forward from here.'
