Melbourne-born Fiona Graham lives a life starkly different to any Australian- working in one of Japan's largest cities as the first Caucasian geisha in the notoriously secretive profession in almost 400 years. 

Ms Graham, who holds a PhD in Social Anthropology from Oxford, formally debuted as a geisha in 2007 after a life-long fascination with Japanese culture and a lengthy training period.

Working under the name 'Sayuki', which means 'transparent happiness', she was first introduced to Japan on a school trip when she was just 15, and was so taken with the country that she moved to continue her schooling at a Japanese High School.

After attending the country's prestigious Keio University, Sayuki went on to study a doctorate in social anthropology at Oxford, where she developed a particular interest in the exclusive geisha world.

Sayuki began work on a documentary about the culture, and said that she found herself drawn into the world completely. 

'As a documentary maker, the thought of making a documentary from the inside of the geisha world was tantalising. No foreigner has ever become a geisha before so my insight is unique,' Sayuki told Daily Mail Australia.

In a groundbreaking move, Sayuki was accepted into a 'okiya', a geisha training house, where she was taught the rituals, customs, and practices of living as a geisha.

Despite the often tawdry reputation that the geisha world has in Western society, the women are regarded as artists, specialising in particular skills and offering entertainment, along with companionship, to their clients. 

Much of the focus is on providing entertainment around the dinner table, including genteel tea ceremonies, drinking rituals, musical performance, dance and calligraphy.

'The tea-houses where we entertain customers are exquisite traditional rooms, and from the paintings to the dishes, everything is perfection,' Sayuki said.

'The kimono that geisha wear are also works of art. And being able to work by performing is wonderful.' 

Sayuki's speciality is playing the bamboo flute, as one of the main part of being a geisha is learning an art. 

'I had to begin with dance, drum and tea ceremony lessons. I had to abandon some of these later when my father got terminal cancer,' Sayuki said.

'Instead, I practiced the things I could do while helping to look after him for weeks at a time - shamisen (3 string lute) and singing, and I still do those,' she said.

'But my main specialty is Japanese bamboo flute. I take classes in four different types of music, and from four different teachers, for flute alone.'  

Despite Western misconceptions that link geishas with sexuality, Sayuki maintains that geishas are full time working artists.  

'Misconceptions about geisha are largely foreign misconceptions. Japanese know very well that geisha are extremely dedicated dancers and musicians,' Sayuki said.

'The word geisha means artist literally in Japanese. Geisha are always unmarried and are able to have a love affair with whomever they choose, but, in general, it would have to be an above average man to make a geisha fall in love with him.' 

The numbers of geishas in Japan has shrunk from 80,000 in 1920 to just 2,000- but  Sayuki said that the women are strong and resilient businesswomen.  

Sayuki spent more than three years working at a geisha house in Ayakusa, Tokyo's historic pleasure district, before she distanced herself from the Ayakusa's Geisha Association in 2011.

She now works independently, offering 'parties' and tours, and launching a secondhand kimono business.

Sayuki also 'raises' geisha, and has trained five young geisha from different districts in Japan in her geisha house.  

Each kimono costs several thousands dollars, including the one that Sayuki made her debut in, which cost more than $25,000.

'My main work is being a geisha: attending banquets, traveling overseas and around Japan to do talks and events, and finding and training my new little geisha,' Sayuki said.

'I also lecture in geisha studies at one of Japan's best universities. I was the first geisha to be employed by a university, and the my classes are the first time geisha culture has been taught at university in Japan,' she said.

'This is the kind of modern new development that I think is really positive for the geisha world, and my students say they love the classes. They all get to dress up as geisha, and also to attend banquets, and dance recitals.' 

Sayuki is passionate about providing foreigners with access to the geisha world, as tea-house generally do not allow strangers to enter without an introduction.

In the case of Sayuki's geisha house, she is considered the introduction and so has created a unique way to gain an insight into the culture without breaking the rules of the geisha world.

One of her future projects will be making a documentary on her geisha house, which she believes to be a fascinating subject.
