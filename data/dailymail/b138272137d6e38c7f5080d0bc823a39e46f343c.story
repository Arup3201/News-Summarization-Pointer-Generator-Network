Handing out fatherly advice, putting a reassuring arm around a shoulder and helping youngsters with their school work - it is not your average video clip of Wayne Rooney.

The Manchester United and England star, however, showed there is more to him than scoring goals and hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons on a visit to Stretford High School.

The 29-year-old joined team-mate Paddy McNair to surprise youngsters, walking in unannounced while they were in the middle of a class.

And in a clip posted by the club's charity arm, the Manchester United Foundation, the dad-of-two reveals his fatherly traits.

The youngsters were told to make a football team from a variety of animals.

And Rooney went for a selection that manager Louis van Gaal may wish to ponder when he goes shopping for new defender this summer, putting a meerkat at centre-half 'because he's quicker so he can cover the hippo and the hedgehog'.

There was also laughter when Rooney asked why the giraffe was playing upfront.

'Fellaini?' asked a cheeky pupil.

Rooney then delivered a fascinating insight into his mindset to his enthralled audience.

'I came through at Everton playing first team when I was 16 and I played for England at 17,' he explained.

'Sometimes when you're that young it's difficult to read stuff about yourself in the newspaper but it's important you don't take too much notice of it because you have to do your job on the pitch and in your work and not listen to what other people think. What's important is what you think and your family and friends around you.'

From the classroom it was out to the football pitch and an impromptu training session.

Rooney, never shy of making his feelings known on the field, urged one boy waiting for a pass: 'If you want the ball shout louder!'.

He said of the visit: 'We're Manchester United players, we're in a privileged position so it's great to come and see the kids, give them some advice and hopefully it helps them.'

Head teacher James Heseldine had no doubts over the pair's impact.

'Just seeing the childrens' reaction is amazing,' he said.

'Seeing the England captain come to help you with your project on a normal Monday afternoon is special stuff and something they will remember for the rest of their lives.'
