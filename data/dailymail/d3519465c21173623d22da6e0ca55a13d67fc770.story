The driver of an armored delivery truck found emptied and abandoned on Monday in Texas has been arrested in Colorado.

Trent Cook, 24, of Amarillo, and a second white male were busted in Colorado Springs on Wednesday afternoon. The name of the second suspect was not released.

‘Investigators have confirmed that money believed to have been taken in the theft has been recovered,’ said Amarillo police in a statement.

Cook has been charged with first-degree felony theft of over $200,000, reports ABC News.

Cook's father, Brian Hodge, 43, was arrested on Monday evening for tampering with or fabricating evidence in connection with the case.

Police found the Rochester Armored Car Co. vehicle at around 7:50 a.m. on Monday, after receiving a call that it was standing unoccupied. The vehicle was assigned to make rounds filling ATM machines with cash.

‘There was no sign of a struggle or forced entry into the vehicle,’ police said, adding that ‘investigators have information that the suspect had discussed how a theft like this would be committed.’

Authorities have not revealed the contents of the vehicle. 

Cook was being held at the El Paso County, Colorado jail, pending extradition to Texas. 

Emptied: On Monday, authorities found this Rochester Armored Car Co. abandoned with its contents stolen; Cook, the driver, was nowhere to be found

He was apprehended at a local hotel based on information provided by the Amarillo police.

When authorities found the abandoned vehicle  around 7.50 a.m. in a vacant lot, the Amarillo Police Department listed Cook as a 'missing/endangered person,' but later, investigators said they had reason to believe Cook was involved in the heist.

'Investigators have developed credible evidence Cook has access to a rifle and handguns, and could be considered dangerous due to this information,' the department said in a statement while they were still searching for Cook. 

On Tuesday, police issued the warrant for Cook and arrested Hodge who, they say, tampered with or fabricated evidence involving the case.

Abandoned: On Monday, police found the armored company vehicle abandoned with its contents emptied nearly 30 minutes after the truck went missing

Cook's family had claimed he wasn't voluntarily involved in the heist. They said if he did have anything to do with it, it would have been against his will.

But, investigators uncovered that Cook had discussed with others how a heist like this could be pulled off, according to Fox News. 

On Tuesday evening, authorities even found a white 1995 Ford van in a parking lot which they believe was Cook's getaway vehicle. 

'This recovery indicates that the suspect changed cars in the area early in the day, possibly shortly after the theft,' the department said in a statement, according to Fox.

'It is unknown if he was picked up by another person or if the suspect had pre-positioned a second vehicle at that scene.'

Cook is a former reservist of the U.S. Army who had recently quit his job at an Amarillo correctional facility to work for the Rochester Armored Car Company

Bill Wills, Cook's stepfather told the Huffington Post that his son is a former reservist with the U.S. Army and recently quit his job at an Amarillo correctional facility to work for the armored car company.

The family told ABC that Cook loved his job and had nothing to do with the crime.

Cook was not armed and authorities believe he was the only employee in the truck at the time.
