An LGBT advocacy group has moved the location of a conference it is planning to hold later this year from the Beverly Hills Hotel to a different location in protest of anti-gay policies being adopted by the Sultan of Brunei - the owner of the hotel - that calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death.

The Gill Action Fund, which was founded by activist Tim Gill, was scheduled to host its 'Winning the Heartland' conference for political donors at the Hotel from May 1-4.

However, because of the draconian laws regarding 'sexual crimes' Brunei is set to adopt later this month, the group has canceled its conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel and is looking for a new location.

The organizers of the annual Oscars Night Before Party have announced that they are joining the growing boycott of the Beverley Hills Hotel and will be hosting their event elsewhere in 2015

Sharia: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah plans to implement a Sharia Penal Code, which calls for the stoning of gays

'In light of the horrific anti-gay policy approved by the Government of 
Brunei, Gill Action made the decision earlier today to relocate its 
conference from the Beverly Hills Hotel to another property,' Gill Action Executive Director Kirk Fordham told washingtonblade.com. 'We are seeking a return of all deposits.'

Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced last year that his tiny, oil-rich nation would begin to implement a Shariah Penal Code in his country, which calls for grisly executions of anyone committing a variety of sexual 'crimes,' including sodomy, adultery and rape.

'By the grace of Allah, with the coming into effect of this legislation, our duty to Allah is therefore being fulfilled,' the sultan said at a legal conference in Brunei's capital last year.

The law would apply only to Muslims, who comprise about two-thirds of the population of nearly 420,000 people. The others follow mainly Buddhist, Christianity and indigenous beliefs.

Boycott: The Gill Action Fund, started by activist Tim Gill, is taking its business elsewhere

Brunei's Mufti Awang Abdul Aziz, the country's top Islamic scholar, said last year that Shariah law 'guarantees justice for everyone and safeguards their well-being.'

'Let us not just look at the hand-cutting or the stoning or the caning per se, but let us also look at the conditions governing them,' Awang said. 'It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning. There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair.'

Under secular laws, Brunei already prescribes caning as a penalty for crimes including immigration offenses, for which convicts can be flogged with a rattan cane.

The United Nations already has criticized Brunei's adoption of the Sharia Penal Code, claiming it does not meet international human rights standards.

'Under international law, stoning people to death constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and is thus clearly prohibited,” UN High Commission on Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville said last week.

Even before the new penal code was adopted, homosexual acts were punishable by up to 10 years in prison in Brunei.

Dorchester: The hotel is owned by the Dorchester Group, which is controlled by the Sultan and owns other hotels throughout the world

The
 LGBT rights group behind the secret conference for high-dollar LGBT 
donors announced Thursday it has cancelled plans to hold the event at 
the Beverly Hills Hotel following news that its owner, the Sultan of 
Brunei, would institute a policy in his country to punish gay people 
with death by stoning.

The OutGiving conference, known this year as “Winning the Heartland,”
 was set as of Thursday to take place at the Beverly Hills Hotel from 
May 1-4, according to the registration website for the conference.

The hotel is owned by Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, who 
announced this month plans for his country to start punishing same-sex 
relations with death by stoning in addition to subjecting perpetuators 
of rape, adultery and extramarital sexual relations to the same 
punishment. That policy would be consistent with Islamic Sharia law in 
the predominately Muslim country.

After the Washington Blade raised the connection on Thursday with the
 Gill Action Fund, which organizes OutGiving, the organization said it 
had notified the hotel earlier in the day the conference would no longer
 take place at that location.

Kirk Fordham, executive director of Gill Action, informed the Blade 
that a new venue would be chosen in the aftermath of the announcement 
from the sultan of Brunei.

“In light of the horrific anti-gay policy approved by the Government 
of Brunei, Gill Action made the decision earlier today to relocate its 
conference from the Beverly Hills Hotel to another property,” Fordham 
said. “We are seeking a return of all deposits.“

The United Nations has already criticized the new policy in Brunei. 
Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Human Rights said, “Application of the death penalty 
for such a broad range of offences contravenes international law.”

Even before the latest policy announcement, Brunei had a law on the 
books unfavorable to gay people. Homosexual acts were punishable with up
 to 10 years in prison.

LGBT activists have previously targeted the Beverly Hills Hotel for 
its connections to Brunei and its anti-gay policy. Last year, the group 
Dump the Beverly Hills Hotel posted a quirky online video where individuals announced they were “breaking up” with the hotel unless its owners changed their homophobic ways.

Fordham didn’t immediately respond to a follow-up email asking why 
the Beverly Hills Hotel was chosen for OutGiving in the first place 
given the anti-gay policies of Brunei prior to the latest announcement 
and the criticism to which the hotel has been subjected.

The OutGiving conference is geared toward high-roller donors whose 
philanthropic giving each year exceeds $25,000 and who are interested in
 the LGBT movement. Tickets for this year’s conference are $1,750 per 
person. No media are permitted at the conference and attendees are told 
to keep the discussions during the conference a secret.

Leslie Lefkowitz, a spokesperson for the Beverly Hills Hotel, said in
 response to the OutGiving cancellation that conferences sometimes 
decide to change venues.

“In the hotel industry, it is not uncommon for organizations to 
change aspects of their corporate programs, including the scope, date 
and/or venues of planned events,” Lefkowitz said. “Anytime a valued 
business partner decides to alter their plans, we respect their right to
 do so and look forward to the next opportunity to be of service to 
them.”

During the 2012 OutGiving conference, which took place in D.C. at the
 Mandarin Oriental Hotel, speakers included former Republican National 
Committee chair Ken Mehlman; Prop 8 attorney Ted Olson; Mary Bonauto of 
Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders; U.S. congressional 
candidate Sean Eldridge; Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.); Sen. Susan Collins
 (R-Maine); and Obama campaign manager David Plouffe.
