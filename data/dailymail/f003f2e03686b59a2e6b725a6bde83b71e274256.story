England captain Alastair Cook took his first ever Test Match wicket on the final evening of the first Test against India on Sunday.

With three overs left in the day, and the match certain to end as a draw, Cook opted to bowl himself from one end, and Gary Ballance from the other.

In a light-hearted end to a Test that rarely looked like producing a result, the England skipper produced an over of questionable offspin, before steaming in with some slow medium pace and having Ishant Sharma caught behind in his second over.Â 

Experimental: Cook comes in to bowl his first over in a Test Match since 2008 on day five of the first Test

How's that? The England skipper appeals after Sharma nicks him to Prior who takes the catch

Delight: Cook celebrates his maiden test wicket after Sharma gets a faint touch on a ball down the leg side

Dual action: Cook's first over was slow off-spin which caused few problems before he switched to medium pace

Gesture: Cook holds up the ball which took the famous wicket to the crowd as the match ended in a draw

All smiles: The players saw the funny side of things as the England captain brought himself on to bowl

Sharma got a faint edge on a ball which drifted down the leg side, leaving Cook with figures of 1-6 from his two overs.

It was Cook's first bowl since 2008, when he bowled a single over against South Africa at Lord's.

Happy ending: The excitement was palpable as the England captain picked up a wicket

Relief: Cook pointed to the dressing room as he finished a difficult Test on an unexpected high

Raucous: The skipper reacted with unbridled joy to his first ever Test scalp

Bowling machine: Gary Ballance appeals during his one over, which proved quite threatening

He does however have six First Class wickets, at an average of 34, including an impressive best of 3-13.

Ballance, who bowled a reasonable over from the other end, has never taken a wicket at any level.
