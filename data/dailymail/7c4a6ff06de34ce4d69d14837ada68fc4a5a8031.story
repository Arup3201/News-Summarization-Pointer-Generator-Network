Javi Martinez is optimistic about returning to action with Bayern Munich after revealing that his rehabilitation from a torn cruciate ligament is going well.

The Spanish international suffered a serious knee injury against Borussia Dortmund in the DFL Supercup back in August and has not played since.

But after undergoing successful surgery in Colorado a week after being carried off on a stretcher, Martinez is now feeling positive about his condition.

He told Bayern's official website: 'We're right on track.

'I'm feeling better every day. I'm managing more and more exercise, and that's good for me mentally.

'My leg has to become healthy, and my head has to stay healthy.'

Although he is now looking forward to forcing his way back into Pep Guardiola's starting XI, the former Athletic Bilbao man admits that he found it tough after his operation.

Martinez added: 'That was the most difficult time. You can't walk, and you basically can't do anything. Friends, team-mates and the physios kept geeing me up and wishing me all the best.

'It helped me. But I was really down at times and avoided contact with the team. It wasn't an easy period.'
