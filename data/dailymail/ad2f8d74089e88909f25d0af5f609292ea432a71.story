A police officer sent to comfort an elderly man after his son was murdered allegedly seduced him to gain access to the £180,000 he inherited.

PC Clare Stretton, who was then 37, is said to have groomed 82-year-old grandfather Charles Foulkes after his son was hacked to death with an axe.

Mr Foulkes’s family say Stretton knew he was rich and vulnerable, and that his wife, Dorothy, was terminally ill.

The pair sent text messages, with one from Stretton allegedly reading: ‘I love you so very much darling.’ In another, she reportedly said: ‘You have made my life special in so many ways.’ 

She is said to have worn low-cut blouses, showered the pensioner with attention, and even took him to the scene of his son’s murder wearing a fluffy pink top and a miniskirt.

After Mrs Foulkes died, a besotted Mr Foulkes allegedly raided his bank account to wine and dine the police officer, now 47, over ten years.

They embarked on a sexual relationship, with Stretton urging him to buy condoms and Viagra, it is claimed.

His family say Mr Foulkes transferred at least £11,500 into the police officer’s bank account, as well as frittering away more than £60,000 in cash.

His three daughters say they told West Mercia Police about the ‘inappropriate’ affair in 2002, 2006 and 2007, but nothing was done to stop it.

They have now lodged a writ at the High Court seeking reparations of £100,000 from Stretton as well as unspecified damages for ‘serious distress’.

In January, three years after Mr Foulkes died at 92, Stretton was questioned on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.

A review is also being carried out by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). 

Last night, Mr Foulkes’s  daughter Michele Pugh, 66, of Craven Arms, Shropshire, said: ‘We know that strumpet persuaded and encouraged our father to spend large amounts of money on her.

'I was shocked when my father, in his eighties, started asking me about Viagra, but it was only after his death that we discovered his supply of pills and condoms.’

The retired painter and decorator met Stretton when she was assigned as his family liaison officer after his son, Colin, 49, was hacked to death in 2001 by schizophrenic lodger John Latus, then 31, who was jailed for life.

The pensioner, a bell-ringer at his local church, became wealthy after inheriting his son’s estate.

His housebound wife, who referred to Stretton as his ‘bit of fluff’, died a few months later.

As the relationship with Stretton 
allegedly became sexual, Mr Foulkes went on a diet and asked his teenage
 grandson for tips on how to look trendy.

Mr Foulkes’s youngest daughter, Carla Kelly, 50, said: ‘When he was dying in hospital she never once turned up, but I suppose he couldn’t get to the cash machine from his bed.’ 

Her sister, Charmaine Jones, 56, said: ‘Even on his death bed he kept looking at his phone, just waiting for her text or call.

'All too late it dawned on him what had happened, but he still kept looking at his phone like a lovestruck teenager waiting for a call.’ 

West Mercia Police said it had conducted an investigation but it would not comment before the IPCC had reviewed its findings.

Stretton, of Telford, Shropshire, refused to comment.
