The man authorities say killed a Transportation Security Administration screener and wounded three other people during a rampage at Los Angeles International Airport last month pleaded not guilty on Thursday to murder and other felony charges in a case that could bring the death penalty.

Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, who was wounded before his arrest, occasionally touched a bandage on his neck and spoke in a hoarse voice during a three-minute arraignment before a federal magistrate at the West Valley Detention Center east of Los Angeles where there is a medical facility.

The diminutive defendant acknowledged his name in a near-whisper and that he had read his 11-count indictment.

Trial was set for February 11 in a downtown Los Angeles federal court.

Authorities say the unemployed motorcycle mechanic arrived at the airport's Terminal 3 on November 1 with the intention of killing TSA workers.

Officials have said Ciancia had a grudge against the agency, but they have not indicated what prompted it.

After entering the terminal, police say Ciancia pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a duffel bag and began spraying the area with gunfire as hundreds of people fled in terror.

TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez was killed. Two other uniformed TSA officers and a traveler were wounded.

Hernandez, 39, became the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty. A coroner's report showed he was struck by a dozen bullets.

Witnesses have said that after first shooting him the gunman returned to shoot again when he saw Hernandez move.

Airport police arrested Ciancia following a gunfight in which they wounded him four times.

An indictment accuses him of 'substantial planning and premeditation to cause the death of a person and to commit an act of terrorism'.

Authorities say if convicted he could be sentenced to death.

Ciancia is from Pennsville, New Jersey, and moved to Los Angeles in 2012.

It was revealed earlier this month that federal agents are investigating the possibility that the alleged gunman believed in a conspiracy theory about a global takeover by the government.

The
 FBI were given a warrant in early November to search Paul Ciancia's 
cell phone for materials reflecting his 'views on the legitimacy or 
activities of the United States government, including the existence of a
 plot to impose a New World Order,' according to court documents.

Ciancia, an unemployed motorcycle 
mechanic, got a ride to LAX on November 1, walked inside and began 
targeting Transportation Security Administration officers, authorities 
said.

By the time LAX police officers subdued him with several gunshots, one TSA officer, Gerardo I. Hernandez, had been killed and two others were injured.

A
 note found in a bag after the shooting mentioned the 'NWO,' an apparent
 reference to the new world order belief that holds an international 
cabal of elites is planning to take away the guns and personal freedoms 
of Americans, authorities said.

Perceived
 masterminds behind the conspiracy have shifted over several 
generations, among them bankers, communists and the government itself. 
Why airport security officers apparently came to personify oppression 
for the gunman remains unclear.

The TSA does not regularly feature as a
 target of the theory's ire, according to Mark Potok, who has studied 
extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center.

More
 typically, believers focus on another homeland security agency, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which according to the theory plans
 to build camps to detain resisters to the new order, Potok said.

Potok said he has seen no evidence that Ciancia was personally involved in hate groups.

The rant in his note also spoke of how
 TSA searches were a violation of constitutional rights and a vulgar 
term was used to refer to Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of the 
Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TSA.

Ciancia's family, from Pennsville, New Jersey, have offered sympathy to the family of the victim. In a statement, they also expressed their shock at the rampage and hope for the recovery of the surviving victims.

A motive? They are investigating his ties to the belief in the New World Order - that a totalitarian regime will take away weapons and freedoms. Pictured, Los Angeles airport after the shooting
