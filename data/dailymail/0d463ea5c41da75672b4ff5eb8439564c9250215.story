At this price you might get more mileage and better suspension out of a decent second-hand car from the local Ford garage - but it would be nowhere near as fun.

A children's version of the magical car from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang has been produced with an electric engine and can chug along at the pleasant maximum speed of 8mph.

The impressive vehicle is expected to go under the hammer for £8,000 at the Bonhams sale at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Chichester, West Sussex, next Saturday (September 15).

What a sight: A toy version of the magical car from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang has been produced with an electric engine and can chug along at the pleasant speed of 8mph

It was constructed earlier this year by a model-maker who specialises in creating replicas - and the seat in the car moves forward and back to enable adults to also get behind the wheel.

The vehicle has a steel chassis, axle and mudguards, a varnished wooden, boat-style body, polished aluminium bonnet and brass radiator grill.

Bonhams spokesman Toby Wilson said: ‘It is a modern construction and was made this year by a man who makes them as a hobby.

‘He sells them to make enough money to buy the materials to start his next project. For him the intrigue is in the scale modelling and making it look as good as possible.

‘The object is to finish with a vehicle 
that can be driven by a child. And with this car the seats move so dad 
can have a go if he wants to.’

The car also has deep buttoned maroon 
leathercloth seats and coach-style working headlights - and fold-out 
wings with working helicopter blades that pop out from beneath the 
running boards.

It is 7.3ft (224cm) long and comes with pneumatic tyres with a spare hanging off the side, and also a glass windscreen.

Mr Wilson added: ‘It is made to take the weight of a large adult. It has the added attraction of being a movie car and the wings pop out so the driver can fly away from the child catcher.

Original film: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was a 1968 musical film loosely based on Ian Fleming's novel Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car

'It really would make an excellent present for a child.’

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was a 1968 musical film loosely based on Ian Fleming's novel Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car. It has also been turned into a musical, which has toured the UK.

It features inventor Caractacus Potts, who builds a flying car which takes him and his family to the fictional Vulgaria, where they come up against the evil Baron Bomburst who hates children.
