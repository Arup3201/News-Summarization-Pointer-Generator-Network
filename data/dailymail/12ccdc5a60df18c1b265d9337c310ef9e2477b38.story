Roy Hodgson has assured Jack Wilshere he will be in England’s World Cup squad even if he does not play again for Arsenal this season.

The England manager, who will be without Andros Townsend after Tottenham confirmed the winger needs surgery on his left ankle, has confirmed he will take Wilshere to Brazil.

Hodgson insists he is picking his squad on the basis of their performances over the past two years in qualification and is unlikely to spring surprises.

On the plane: Jack Wilshere suffered a hairline fracture in his left foot after this challenge with Denmark's Daniel Agger in March

He said: ‘Wilshere has been training with the others at Arsenal and, while he is not being thrown back into the fray, he is there. He has been training with the team, as far as I know, for a while.’

Wilshere has not played since aggravating a foot injury during England’s 1-0 friendly win over Denmark on March 5 at Wembley.The Arsenal midfielder has started training again, but Arsene Wenger is refusing to rush him back into action after more than two months on the sidelines.

Hodgson said: ‘I am not prepared to have a 100 per cent rule that you either play in the last game of the season or you don’t go — I am not prepared to do that.

‘I have spoken to Arsene and they have been holding him back because they don’t want to push him too early.’

Hodgson has a number of other injury concerns ahead of the World Cup, but he claims to know his  23-man squad.

Southampton attacker Jay Rodriguez would have been in Hodgson’s squad but he has been ruled out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and Townsend is also out of contention.

Ruled out: Andros Townsend was inspirational in getting England to Brazil, but will miss the World Cup

ANDROS TOWNSEND, Tottenham, 5 capsSet to have surgery after ankle ligament damage against Stoke last Saturday ended his season.

READY TO STEP UP...

Raheem Sterling, Liverpool, 2 capsThe in-form winger with three goals in his last three games. Playing a huge role in Liverpool’s title tilt.

James Milner, Manchester City, 45 capsOften preferred by Roy Hodgson to bring a defensive balance to the midfield and has been a consistent performer for City this season.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal, 14 capsHas occupied a more central role for Arsene Wenger but will still be an option out wide once he has fully recovered from a groin injury.

Tottenham full back Kyle Walker has a niggling pelvic injury, while Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (groin) and Phil Jagielka (hamstring) are concerns.

But Hodgson is optimistic. ‘My decisions will be based on the information I get from clubs’ managers and medical staff. I’m rather hoping we go with everyone basically fit,’ he said.

‘Kyle is a bit more of a difficult one because it is a long time since he has been fit. We are still monitoring the situation and we haven’t been told for certain that he will be out for the next six weeks but we’re concerned it has been a long time.

‘He has not been able to do any training and I know he has had another injection. We are waiting to find out about that.’

Townsend left Stoke last Saturday wearing a protective boot after he had come on for 12 minutes of Tottenham’s 1-0 win. He will have surgery on his ankle today after the results of an MRI scan confirmed serious ligament damage.

The 22-year-old will require a 10-week recovery period. Townsend looked a certainty to go to the World Cup after making an explosive impact for England in their final two qualifiers against Montenegro and Poland which clinched their place in Brazil.

But a loss of form saw him lose his place in the Spurs starting XI, while the emergence of Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and Southampton’s Adam Lallana had put further pressure on his squad place.

Bright young thing: Raheem Sterling has dazzled for Liverpool this season and looks a shoo-in for Brazil

Hodgson said: ‘I am very disappointed for him in particular. He had a fantastic debut bursting on to the scene and he did really well.

‘I have been a bit disappointed that he has not had as much playing time over recent months. To see him ruled out like this with a serious ankle injury is a cruel blow.

‘My thoughts are very much with him and the only thing I can say is that he is young and there will be lots of other opportunities.’

Jagielka’s World Cup chances could improve this weekend as he prepares to return for Everton in their Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City.

Hodgson added: ‘We have had good reports back for the last few weeks. He has had a problem but he has been participating to a decent level in training. They have been keen not to throw him back in but we don’t have any fears. He might be back in on Saturday.’
