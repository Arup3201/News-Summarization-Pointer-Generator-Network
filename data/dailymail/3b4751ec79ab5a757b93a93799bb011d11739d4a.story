Guilty: William Owen, 55, pleaded guilty to murdering his partner Sharon Hayter and their disabled daughter Stephanie Owen

A ‘doting father’ has been jailed for life after pleading guilty to killing his long-term partner and their disabled daughter in a brutal double murder.

William Owen - described by the judge as a 'loving' parent - was jailed for a minimum of 23 years and one-and-a-half months after pleading guilty to murdering his partner Sharon Hayter and their daughter Stephanie Owen.

Liverpool Crown Court was told how Miss Hayter, 55, 
and Miss Owen, 29, were found dead at their home in Knowsley, 
Merseyside, on November 28, after being attacked with a claw hammer.

But the court heard there is still no 
clear reason for why Owen, a former hospital nursery nurse and security 
guard, committed the brutal murders.

Sentencing Owen today, Mrs Justice Carr said: 'No one but yourself can say what was going on in your mind that morning.'

A post-mortem carried out after their deaths found both women had died from blunt force trauma to the head.

The murder weapon - believed to be a claw hammer - was never recovered.

Owen,
 who the court heard had made sacrifices to care for his disabled 
daughter, had been set to face trial for the murders on Wednesday.

He had previously claimed that he did 
not kill Stephanie and tried to lay the blame on his dead partner, who 
was the only other person present.

But in a last minute change of heart, he changed his plea and admitted the killings.

Today, the victims’ family said they were glad the 'truth has come out'.

The scene of the double murder where Owen murdered his partner and daughter in November last year

Speaking on behalf of Sharon’s family, her brother, Darren Barnett, said: 'The family are satisfied following the guilty plea today in relation to the murder of our sister Sharon and niece Stephanie in November last year.

'In a 
previous court appearance it was suggested by the defence barrister that
 William Owen did not kill Stephanie and inferred that Sharon may well 
have murdered her own daughter.

'Today the truth has come out and he has pleaded guilty on both counts.

'We would like to take this opportunity to thank the police and Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case to court.

'Sadly, we
 will never know why he murdered Sharon and Stephanie, and we are left 
with the lasting emotional scars and are still trying to come to terms 
with what has happened.'

The judge told Owen: 'You will leave prison an elderly man, if you leave prison at all.

Forensics examine the scene after the deaths of Miss Hayter and Miss Owen. William Owen was expected to stand trial for the crimes but today changed his pleas to guilty

'For
 reasons best known to yourself on the morning of Saturday, November 28,
 2013 you carried out a vicious attack on these two women with some sort
 of heavy instrument.

'You caused fatal head injuries to each. Neighbours heard screaming from the house at around 7.30am.

'You
 told police shortly after the attack that you had used a hammer which 
would be consistent with the medical evidence available as to the 
injuries inflicted.

'But 
nothing that the court has been told about you and your circumstances - 
whether because of your relationship with Miss Hayter or because you 
were simply frustrated by your environment or stressed by your 
daughter’s physical difficulties - could possibly justify your actions 
that day.

'I
 am quite satisfied you intended to kill these women however much you 
may have regretted it later and however much you regret it now.'
