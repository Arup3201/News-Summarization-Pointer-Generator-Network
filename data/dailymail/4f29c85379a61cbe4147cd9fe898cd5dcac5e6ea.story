One man's attempt to paddle his 'human hamster wheel' 66 miles across the Irish Sea came to a sudden end last night - with the giant wheel sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

Chris Todd was aiming to raise thousand of pounds charity by hamster-wheeling his way across the sea - but at around 10.30pm last night, the 35-year-old had to call time on his home-made contraption after the winds picked up and his rudders gave way.

The attempt, on behalf of the the Wiltshire Blind Association and the RNLI, had to come to an end nine hours and 15 miles in to the proposed mission.

Luckily a support team was there to pick up Chris - but sadly the hamster wheel ended up on the sea-bed, where it will lie undisturbed and waiting to perplex future historians.

Failed attempt: Chris Todd sets out on his 66 mile self-powered voyage across the Irish Sea on a craft that looks more hamster wheel than boat

The engineer, from Bromham, Wiltshire, set out on a calm sea from Trearddur Bay, North Wales, at 1.45pm yesterday heading for Greystones harbour in Ireland

Todd, from Bromham, Wiltshire, 
set out on a calm sea from Trearddur Bay, North Wales, at 1.45pm on 
Sunday, heading for Greystones harbour, County Wicklow, Ireland.

But just after 1am this morning, the Tredalo, as the vehicle was known, was hit by moderate winds of between 13-18mph.

Annie Davis, of Wiltshire Blind Association, one of the charities he's raising funds for, said today: 'It's a great shame he had to give up as the sea was like a millpond and who knows when he will have another window in the weather.

'But the upside is that he got much further in those nine hours than he anticipated, so he is determined to try again later this month.'

HM Lifeguard watch officer Richard 
Jones said: 'I think they got to about 12-15 miles outside of South 
Stack Lighthouse. They experienced problems and tried to turn around but
it disintegrated.

'The whole thing has sunk to the bottom of the sea. It won’t be a danger to navigation or shipping.

'Everyone was recovered. They waited around until it sank and then returned to Holyhead Marina.'

Todd, 35, had been waiting for 
optimum conditions before attempting the stunt and launched his craft 
beneath bright clear skies before a crowd of well-wishers.

If all had gone to plan he would have arrived in Greystones harbour today at midday.

As he set off, he said: 'It is going 
to be one of the toughest things I’ve ever done. Imagine spending 
48-hours on a stepping machine in the gym without getting any sleep.

'Some people say I am mad but I’m hoping my madness will inspire generosity for two charities close to my heart.'

Mr Todd said before launch: 'Conditions are perfect - although I'm still quite nervous about how I will fare'

Chris, who hoped to raise funds for 
the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Wiltshire Blind Association,
would have burned around 36,000 calories - almost three weeks worth - 
during the endurance feat.

He was planning to consume 30 litres 
of water and eat the equivalent of 60 Mars bars to keep energy levels up
and stay awake for 48 hours.

He added: 'I’m trying to figure out 
how I’m so anxious about heading off into a calm sea when the RNLI 
launch into much worse stuff all the time

'It will be like running 10 back-to-back marathons.

This crossing is on the very edge of what I believe is possible - but I am looking forward to a cold Guinness on arrival.'

Chris hand-built the human hamster wheel in his garden with help from his wife and friends.

The idea came to him while rowing across a lake - and he spent 11 months painstakingly piecing it together.

He originally planned to use it to 
cross the English Channel, but red-tape and high costs curtailed his 
bid, forcing him to turn to the Irish Sea.

Chris said: 'Just recounting how much help I’ve had to get here makes me feel very lucky.

'The sea is looking calm in the bay 
but the real critical point will be experiencing strong winds - if the 
sea is rough then it could put an end to it.

'I can cope with seven to ten knots but winds of 15 and 16 knots have been forecast.

'The only way we are going know if it will stand up to the battering from the waves is to actually do it.'

Among those gathered to wave Chris off was his wife Joy.

Chris said: 'She isn’t over the moon 
that I am doing it and rejected the idea of accompanying me in the 
safety boat, but she is very supportive.

'She has become quite used to my endurance feats and I’ve been very thorough with all the risk assessments.'

Mr Todd hopes to raise £20,000 and wants people to check on his progress and donate to his cause on his website irishseacrossing.co.uk.
