Broadway theaters will dim
their marquee lights on Tuesday evening for one minute in memory
of the late Tony-nominated comedian Joan Rivers, after theater
executives reversed a decision that Rivers did not meet the
criteria for the honor.

Rivers, who died last week at the age of 81, was initially
excluded from the honor because she had not acted on Broadway in
20 years.

'Joan Rivers loved Broadway and we loved her,' said
Charlotte St. Martin, executive director of The Broadway League,
which represents producers and theater owners.

The one-and-only Joan Rivers will be honored by Broadway tonight after she died at the age of 81 last Thursday in New York  

'Due to the outpouring of love and respect for Joan Rivers
from our community and from her friends and fans worldwide, the
marquees of Broadway theaters in New York will be dimmed in her
memory tonight, at exactly 6:45pm for one minute,' she said in
an email.

After the initial decision, Off-Broadway producer Tom
D'Angora started an online petition urging the Broadway League
to change its decision. He collected more than 4,400 signatures.

Brooklyn-born Rivers, known for her brash style and the
catchphrase, 'Can we talk?,' died last Thursday at a New York
hospital after she stopped breathing during a procedure at a
medical clinic.

Rivers, who had a long career as a stand-up comedian, TV
host, author and reality star, was nominated for a best actress
Tony for 1994's 'Sally Marr ... and Her Escorts,' which she
wrote.

She also wrote and appeared in the comedy play Fun City in
the early 1970s, and more than a decade later in the comedy Broadway Bound.

The New Amsterdam theater on Broadway, where Disney's Aladdin is currently showing, will be one theater which will dim its lights for Joan Rivers this evening
