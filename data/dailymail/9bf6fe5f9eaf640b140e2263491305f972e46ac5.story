Tech juggernaut Google may be hatching a plan to make their claim on the U.S. auto insurance industry.

An entity named Google Compare Auto Insurance Services is not licensed to sell insurance in 26 states as well as being authorized to sell policies in one state for six insurers, revealed analyst Ellen Carney.

More evidence: A Google executive was recently given authorization to sell insurance using Google Compare.

The Wall Street Journal reports that there's evidence Google could work with CoverHound, an auto-insurance comparison site in San Francisco. 

It's likely the company wants to displace middle men in the industry just as it's done to the shopping business and travel industry. 

'We can't comment on speculation,' said a Google spokeswoman in response to the reports. 'Don't fault us though, we enjoy your coverage.'

Insurance Solutions at CoverHound president Greg Isaacs agreed that the Meredith Stechbart of Google is now endorsed on the company's insurance license.

However he added: 'We haven't been acquired' and declined to comment further on any shared plans.

Google could meet with pushback in their plans as insurance companies will be reluctant to share information with a potential competitor. 

Some retailers have also declined to add a 'buy' button for their products to be bought direct from Google pages. 

As smartphone users are increasingly directed to different company's apps to make purchases, Google is being forced to provide better searches, the Journal notes.
