A tax hike on cigarettes makes the vulnerable drink less alcohol, according to a new study.

Researchers found that those closed as 'vulnerable' - excessive drinkers, young and less well off smokers - consume less alcohol if the price of tobacco is increased.

In the first study of its kind, experts at Yale University found a 'modest to moderate' reduction in alcohol intake when smoking becomes more expensive.

Professor Sherry McKee said: 'Smoking and heavy drinking co-occur at alarmingly high rates.

'Tobacco can enhance the subjective effects of alcohol and has been shown to increase the risk for heavy and problematic drinking.

'Smokers drink more frequently and more heavily than non-smokers, and are substantially more likely than non-smokers to meet criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence.'

The results of the study, published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, added that the health risks are greatly increased when alcohol and tobacco are consumed together.

It also found that an increase in tax on cigarettes leads to less people taking up smoking, more people quitting and a decrease in the number of smoking related deaths.

Professor McKee added: 'Cigarette taxes have broad population reach and have been recognized as one of the most significant policy instruments to reduce smoking.

'By increasing the price of cigarettes, taxes are thought to encourage smokers to reduce their use of cigarettes or quit altogether, and discourage non-smokers from starting to smoke.'

The study looked at interviews with more than 21,000 drinkers as part of a large scale U.S study.

While the results suggest that an increase in taxes on cigarrettes stopped male drinkers consuming as much alcohol, that effect was increased among heavy male drinkers, young adults and those with the lowest income.

Dr Christopher Kahler, of Brown University, said: 'These findings suggest that if states increase taxes on cigarettes, they are not only likely to reduce smoking - based on a large body of literature - but they also may have a modest impact on heavy drinking rates among men, those with lower income, and those who drink most heavily.'
