Jailed: Rachel Hewitt, 39, pictured outside court at an earlier hearing, was jailed for 18 months today for her 'pack of lies'

When police officer Rachel Hewitt told bosses her teenage daughter was desperately ill with cancer they did everything they could to help.

She was given compassionate leave, favourable shifts and time off sick – because of depression – as her daughter was battling for her life, a court was told.

It went on for two years but, incredibly, it was all a sham.

Hewitt, 39, invented the cancer story so she could go to show jumping events with her two daughters, who were both fit and well.

Yesterday she was jailed for 18 months for abusing the trust of her police employers and the colleagues who donated cash to help her supposedly sick child.

Judge Simon Jack said her actions ‘undermined the trust the police have in each other’ as well as the ‘trust the public has in the police’.

He told Hewitt: ‘You told lies on top of lies over a long period. It was prolonged and cynical lying.

‘The type of lies you told were so emotive about a child having cancer no one would think they were false. That is why you were able to get away with it for so long.’

Hewitt had claimed daughter Natasha, 15, had to have chemotherapy and an operation to remove a tumour. She also told colleagues that the teenager was treated in a hospital intensive care unit and was feared to be terminally ill.

Bosses did not check her story or ask for documentation because no one believed the married mother-of-two would lie about such a thing, Hull Crown Court heard.

In reality Hewitt was devoting her time and energy to the budding equestrian careers of Natasha and sister Jessica, 13.

The traffic constable with the North Yorkshire force started the scam in September 2009 and was not caught out until October 2011.

Con: Hull Crown Court heard that she had gained large sums of money from her deception

Instead of being in hospital or 
nursing her sick daughter, as she claimed, Hewitt was travelling to show
jumping competitions. She also took a total of five months off sick, 
claiming to be depressed, at a cost to taxpayers of up to £15,000.

Lies: Hewitt spent most of her time developing the bugging equestrians careers of teenage daughters

She was given ten days’ compassionate 
leave and received £1,540 in pay in the process and police colleagues 
lost £150, which had been donated to buy a portable DVD player and 
vouchers for Natasha. Simon Batiste, prosecuting, said that the public 
expected ‘the highest levels of honesty and integrity’ in police 
officers.

Hewitt, of South Elmsall, West 
Yorkshire, admitted two charges of fraud and misconduct in public office
at an earlier hearing. It has not been revealed how she was eventually 
exposed, but she resigned in disgrace.

Her husband John, 44, a security 
guard, was not at court. The family are well-known in show jumping and 
Jessica competed at the Horse of the Year Show last year.

Mr Batiste told the court the con 
began when Hewitt claimed to be ill with swine flu. This coincided with a
five-day show jumping festival.

Hewitt then told her manager Natasha 
had gone to a doctor after hurting her back falling off a horse and a 
lump had been discovered. In time, this ‘lump’ had to be removed and 
chemotherapy was required.

She sent several emails saying she spent her days cleaning up sick and was not coping.

After months off work through 
‘depression’ she returned in January 2010 and was given shortened 
shifts, as well as Fridays and weekends off. This enabled Hewitt to 
attend junior equestrian events.

In May 2010 Natasha was supposedly in 
hospital with pneumonia and in reality was competing in an East 
Yorkshire show, said Mr Batiste.

In another email, Hewitt even claimed 
‘there was a risk the cancer had spread to Natasha’s blood’ and 
chemotherapy was only ‘giving her time’.
