A Colorado boy, six, was given a one-day suspension after aiming his fingers at a classmate in the shape of a gun while saying 'you're dead'.

Elijah Thurston, a first grade student, was given the punishment from Stratton Meadows Elementary School for threats against peers following the incident on Monday.

His father, Austin Thurston, said the disciplinary action was 'a little extreme' for the young child who was 'playing', and that no recess might have been more suitable.

'Of course I think he was playing. What six-year-old doesn't play cops and robbers, or cowboys and Indians?' Mr Thurston told KRDO.

A school administrator spoke to Elijah, who has been attending the school since January, about the meaning of the word 'dead' and how he should not confuse games or make-believe things with reality, according to the behavior report.

The school takes into consideration previous and current behaviors and also speaks to both the student and parents before issuing a suspension, said a spokesperson for Harrison School District Two.

They feel they gave the appropriate punishment following the incident.

Specific details of the case cannot be released because it is a part of the student's personal record.

Elijah is writing a letter to the school apologizing for his actions, even though it is not required of him. His parents have since spoken to him about the severity of what he said and that school is not the place for those actions

Mr Thurston said that while this is Elijah's first time in trouble at the school, he previously had minor behavioral incidents at the school he attended before Stratton Meadows.

His parents were concerned that this incident would be included on his personal behavior record, but it appears that it will not, according to Fox31. 

Elijah is writing a letter to the school apologizing for his actions and expressing that he understands what he did, even though it was not required of him by staff.

'We let him know that the guns in the wrong hands will be very dangerous,' said Mr Thurston.

'He knows the difference between really doing that, and just putting your finger up and saying, "boom you're dead". We made sure he understands the severity of what he said.'
