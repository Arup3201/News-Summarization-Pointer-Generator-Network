Nestled in the depths of the Amazon rainforest thousands of miles 
from the biblical, war-torn lands of the Middle East, lives a small 
community of people who call themselves Los Israelites.

Seattle-based
 photographer Stan Raucher has made the long journey down the Amazon 
River to document the everyday lives of Peruvian villagers who adhere to
 ancient Judeo-Christian traditions that go back thousands of 
years in a series of striking black and white photographs. 

Officially called Asociación Evangélica de la 
Misión Israelita del Nuevo Pacto Universal (AEMINPU), the evangelical 
sect that seamlessly blends Old and New Testament traditions was founded
 in 1958 by Ezequiel Gamonal, a shoemaker from a small Peruvian village.

Welcome to the promised land: For the past six decades, a small community of Peruvians calling themselves Los Israelites have been living in the Amazon rainforest according to biblical laws

Humble beginnings: The evangelical sect called Asociación Evangélica de la Misión Israelita del Nuevo Pacto Universal was founded in 1958 by Ezequiel Gamonal, a cobbler from Peru

In the footsteps of a prophet: Gamonal proclaimed that he had been chosen by God to build a new Israel in the Amazon wilderness - and many people answered his call

Ancient fashions: The men in the community grow out their hair and beards, while the women dress modestly and cover their tresses with kerchiefs 

Weekend warriors: From Sunday to Friday, the men keep their long hair covered and dress in plain clothes while going about their work, but on Saturday they don flowing robes to take part in a community celebration of the Sabbath

Melting pot of beliefs: Los Israelites gather in their sanctuary to read the bible, which contains both the Old and New Testaments

Raucher writes in his artist statement that Gamonal, a big fan of
 Cecil B. DeMille’s biblical movie epics, converted from Catholicism to 
Seventh-Day Adventism some six decades ago.

A few years later, the
 Peruvian cobbler proclaimed that he had been chosen by God to build a 
new Israel in the Amazon rainforest – and some of his countrymen answered his call.

Men and women from all over Peru left their homes 
and businesses, flocking to Gamonal’s self-styled New Promised Land in 
the tropical forest.

Like modern-day Jews and Seventh-Day 
Adventists, Gamonal’s Los Israelites observe the Sabbath – the 
traditional day of rest – on Saturday, but do not celebrate Christmas or
 Easter, and do not display crosses or images of saints.

The sect members strictly follow the Ten Commandments, 
which they refer to as the Royal Law; a large copy of the holy Decalogue is displayed along with a small ark in the 
sanctuary of the congregation. 

In line with Israelite traditions, men grow out their hair and beards while women keep their tresses covered with kerchiefs.

Music to their ears: The congregants pray and sing hymns to the tune of a brass band

Like modern-day Jews and Seventh-Day Adventists, Gamonal's Los Israelites observe the Sabbath on Saturday, but do not celebrate Christmas or Easter

Village life:  Women in the village work as teachers and care for their children; the kids of Los Israelites attend school, play and do their chores

Matriarchs: This image shows three generations of women from the same Israelite family living on the shores of the Amazon River

Joyful noise: Young women dressed in their finest play tambourines festooned with colorful ribbons during the village's weekly festivities

Separated: Boys sit with male members of the congregation during a Sabbath sermon, while women pray in a different section of the sanctuary

From
 Sunday through Friday, the men wear regular clothes and hide their 
flowing locks beneath baseball caps as they go about farming, fishing 
and tending their livestock. The women teach in the local school and care for children.

When
 Saturday arrives, the community comes together for elaborate, day-long 
festivities that feature bible readings, singing of hymns to the tune of
 a brass band and a feast.

The men attend the weekly celebration
 dressed in flowing robes straight out of DeMille’s Ten Commandments; 
the women don their Saturday’s best, while young girls come to the event rattling tambourines decorated with multi-colored ribbons.

After
 more prayers and pious readings in the sanctuary, the celebration 
culminates with an animal sacrifice carried out by Los Israelites’ 
priests on a special altar.   

The community’s offering to God -
 a lamb, bull or a handful of doves – is meticulously cleaned, rubbed 
with salt and olive oil before being placed on a large pyre.

As 
flames begin to consume the sacrificial animal, men, women and children 
in the audience pray - not unlike their spiritual ancestors surely did 
in the Sinai Peninsula thousands of years ago.  

Let's eat: After hours of prayers, bible readings, hymn singing and sermons, the community sits down to a feast

Grand finale: The Sabbath celebration culminates with an animal sacrifice - usually doves, a lamb or a bull - which is cleaned, rubbed with salt and oil before being placed on a large pyre on an altar 

Peace offering: As flames begin to consume the sacrificial animal, men, women and children in the audience pray
