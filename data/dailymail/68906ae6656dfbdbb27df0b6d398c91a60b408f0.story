A mother who volunteered at the prom where a 17-year-old girl reported being 'ogled' by the dad chaperones has come out to defend the decision to kick her out of the dance.

A Virginia teen named Clare made headlines earlier this month when she wrote a scathing blog post about being ordered to leave the Richmond Homeschool Prom because of her provocative dress and dancing.

In the post on her sister's blog, Clare wrote that her skirt was within regulation, falling below her fingertips, and that she wasn't even dancing when she was asked to leave.

But chaperone Ann Duncan says she saw Clare at the prom, and contested her statements that the dress was an appropriate length and that the dads were staring.

The other side of the story: Virginia mother Ann Duncan volunteered at the same prom that 17-year-old Clare was kicked out of and says the girl's dress was inappropriate. She also says there's no way to know if the chaperone dads were 'ogling'

Night ruined: Virginia teen Clare was kicked out of the Richmond Homeschool Prom when a female chaperone said her dress was too short and her dancing too provocative

Not ok: In a blog post, Clare wrote that her dress was regulation length but Ms Duncan says the dress rode up and became too short

She says the dress may have been the right length when Clare arrived, but that the outfit's spandex fabric caused it to ride up.

'It was right below her butt cheeks by the time I saw her,' Ms Duncan told WTVR.

While Ms Duncan says she didn't see Clare dance, her comments that the dads were gathered on a balcony staring at her are unlikely.

'It was very crowded,' Ms Duncan said. 'There were 500 kids there, so to be able to even say what they were looking at would be really difficult.'

But Clare is standing behind her blog post, and released a video on Monday along with her date to speak more about the prom-gone-wrong.

'When the lady kicked me out, they said the dads had complained about my dancing and that meant that they had to have been watching me,' Clare said.

Clare recounted the whole night in her original post, writing that she was looking forward to going to prom and became especially excited when she found the perfect dress.

But, as soon as she walking into the venue, one of the organizers stopped her at the door and said: 'Honey, that dress is too short,' she claimed.

Clare was able to prove that the dress fell below her fingertips and was eventually allowed in.

'When I got into the ballroom I laughed, because I was surrounded by girls in much shorter dresses then me.' Clare said.

A short while later, as the teenager chatted to her friends and prom date while swaying to the music, she said she noticed a group of fathers staring at her from a balcony.

'We were also a little grossed out by all the dads on the balcony above the dance floor, ogling and talking amongst themselves,' she said.

It was at that point that one of the organizers approached Clare again and asked to speak to her in private.

'[She] told me that some of the dads who were chaperoning had complained that my dancing was too provocative, and that I was going to cause the young men at the prom to think impure thoughts,' Clare claimed.

The teenager said that despite trying to tell the woman that she and her friends hadn't even been dancing, she was told again that her dress was too short and she would have to leave.

Her concerned friends tried to intervene in the conversation, and say they hadn't even been dancing, but they were told the situation 'was none of their business'.

Clare's date also tried to explain that because the group had arrived together, if she was made to leave they would all have to go.

When the friends asked if they would be refunded for a dance they had spent less than half an hour at, they were told only Clare would be given a refund.

As she was being escorted, crying, from the venue, Clare says she asked the security guard what he made of the situation.

'I asked the security guy if my dress was compliant with the dress code and if he had noticed any inappropriateness in my behavior and he said he didn’t think I did anything to get kicked out but it wasn’t his call,' Clare wrote.

'We walked out of the prom, frustrated and angry and feeling very disrespected and violated,' Clare said, admitting that in a moment of immaturity they had shouted profanities.

Clare and her prom group are still waiting on a promised refund for their $25 dollar tickets.
