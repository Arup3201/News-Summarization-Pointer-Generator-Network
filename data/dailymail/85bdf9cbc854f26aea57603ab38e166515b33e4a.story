The area has seen an influx of tourists travelling by hot air balloon to check out the phallic-shaped pillars which have been naturally formed by erosion of the volcanic rock.

They are the result of ancient volcanic eruptions which covered the region with thick ash that solidified into soft rock many meters thick.

Beneath the rocky wonderland, their exists a honeycomb of human-created caves with living quarters, places of worship, stables, and storehouses dug into the soft stone. Entire towns have been formed with as many as eight different storeys underground

Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations

Erosion from the wind and water left only its harder elements behind, forming an unusual landscape of cones, pillars, pinnacles, mushrooms, and 'fairy tale chimneys', some of which are up to 130 feet (40 metres) high.

The number of tourists visiting the Cappadocia region reached a record 1 million last year.
