Rebel fighters are near to capturing Colonel Gaddafi's last two strongholds as the final assault on the remnants of his regime was launched today.

National Transitional Council forces claim to have punched their way into Libya's coastal city of Sirte, where Gaddafi was born.

Truckloads of fighters are also hurtling towards Gaddafi's other last bastion of support, the desert enclave of Bani Walid.

But on both fronts the rebels met stiff resistance.

In Sirte - the hub of a loyalist belt across Libya's central coast - revolutionary units pressed their attack on two fronts with convoys mounted with anti-aircraft guns.

Loyalists responded 
with sniper attacks and rocket barrages.

Smoke rose from parts of the city, where the green flags of Gaddafi's 
regime flew from mosques and buildings.

The Misrata Military Council, 
which is leading the offensive, said anti-Gaddafi 
forces had control of the old airport on the western edge.

Bani Walid has been under siege for two weeks, with hundreds of die-hard Gaddafi loyalists dug into its steep valleys and hills resisting advancing interim government forces.

The NTC had hesitated to storm the town in fear 
of alienating a powerful local tribe, but earlier this week it told 
civilians to flee ahead of a full-out onslaught.

One fighter said today: 'We are going in. We finally have the orders. God is greatest. God willing, Bani Walid will be free today.'

Another fighter, Hisham Nseir, said the frontline is 'very heated 
and chaotic' and the troops were meeting with heavy resistance from 
Gaddafi's men.

Commander Abdullah Abu-Asara said his men were
just over a mile from the heart of Bani Walid, which 
is ringed by mountains and only accessible through a valley 
watched over by pro-Gaddafi marksmen.

As the revolutionary forces advanced, the fighters erected the new 
Libyan flag over an abandoned electricity building and a military 
headquarters in the northern part of Bani Walid.

Around the buildings 
lay a huge Gaddafi poster bent in half and torn billboards with pictures
of the ousted dictator. The walls were still sprayed with graffiti 
reading, 'Long live Moammar'.

Anti-Gaddafi forces also took 
strategic mortar positions, firing shells at the central square in Bani 
Walid that include a Gaddafi residence built on the former site of an 
Ottoman-era fort.

'Today is the first day that we have completely 
taken over this part of Bani Walid,' said fighter Abul-Asara. 'We are 
staying here.'

Inside the town - around 90 miles southeast of Tripoli - a radio station believed linked to one of 
Gaddafi's main propagandists kept up a steady stream of appeals to fight 
and rants that demonised the revolutionaries as traitors against the 
country and Islam.

'Run from Bani Walid and you run straight to your graves,' shouted one man over the radio.

Another portrayed the revolutionaries as trampling on Muslim values.

'These
revolutionaries are fighting to drink and do drugs all the time and be 
like the West, dance all night,' the announcer claimed. 'We are a 
traditional tribal society that refuses such things and must fight it.'

The push comes after  crowds in Benghazi cheered Prime Minister David 
Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday.

Gaddafi's spokesman Moussa Ibrahim 
however warned the visit, the first by foreign leaders since Gaddafi was
ousted, had ulterior motives.

He said: 'The visit marks the start of a project of colonisation of Libya.

'They are hurrying to collect the fruits of the fall of Tripoli ... because they obviously fear the arrival of America and other countries wanting a slice of the cake.'

He also told a pro-Gaddafi TV channel in Syria that 'thousands of volunteers' were ready to 'liberate Libya' from the NTC.

'We
are in fact strong. We have the capabilities, the means and plans to 
liberate the whole of Libya.'

Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has followed Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy, on a visit to the country.

He joined Friday prayers in the heart of the capital Tripoli earlier a day after the French and British leaders' visit.
