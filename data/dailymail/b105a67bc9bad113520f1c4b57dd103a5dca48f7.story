Inspiraton: Conical breast implants provide a 'natural, voluptuous' look similar to that of Joan Holloway

She is the poster girl for the curvy lady.

And while she sets our screens alight 
with her starring role in Mad Men, Hollywood actress Christina Hendricks
appears to be rewriting the rules of beauty.

The actress’s voluptuous physique – showcased by her figure-hugging dresses in her role as secretary Joan Holloway in the U.S. TV drama – has led to a new trend among women seeking breast implants.

Consultant plastic surgeon Garrick 
Georgeu said that in the last 18 months conical implants have grown in 
popularity, with 60 per cent of his patients now opting for the shape.

He
said: ‘Up until two years ago all we had was anatomical-shaped implants
to offer patients which gave a round, almost cartoonish look.

'Many
of my patients are women who have lost volume to their breasts with 
age, or after having children, and so the conical implant is ideal for 
them.

'And what the 
conical implant does is lift up the breast giving them fullness in the 
upper part giving a natural voluptuous look, similar to Christina 
Hendricks.’

Another 
plastic surgeon, Nilesh Sojitra, warned it is essential the right volume
of implant is used, or patients can end up with pointy breasts, similar
to the cone-shaped bras Madonna once favoured.

He
said: ‘Although patients are keen for a round, natural shape, the 
implants have got to be used carefully because if they are used in the 
wrong volumes and in the wrong people you can end up with a pointy 
appearance.’

New trend: More women are choosing conical-shaped over anatomical-shaped breast implants for a 'natural, voluptuous look', surgeons say

But leading plastic surgeon Nilesh 
Sojitra from the Cosmetics Surgery in London’s Harley street, said it is 
essential the right volume of implant is used or patients can end up 
with pointy breasts, similar to Madonna’s cone-shaped silver bra which 
was famously worn in the '90s as part of her Blonde Ambition tour.

He said: ‘Although patients are keen for
a round, natural shape the implants have got to be used carefully 
because if they are used in the wrong volumes and in the wrong people 
you can end up with a pointy appearance.

'The correct type of implant 
needs to be fitted according to the patient’s natural symmetry 
measurements and body shape,' he added.

Actress Hendricks, aged 37, came to global attention for her role in the American drama Mad Men - set in a New York advertising firm during the 1960s.

But despite being labelled a ‘role model for fuller figured women’, it appears the TV star is not comfortable with this reference.

Yesterday it was reported in an Australian newspaper that Miss Hendricks had shut down an interview during which the journalist referred to her as being ‘full figured’.

The flame-haired star is reported to have taken offence at the reference, refusing to answer any further questions.

When she resumed the interview the actress is said to have muttered off camera ‘I think calling me full figured is just rude’.

But on other occasions Miss Hendricks, who is happily married to fellow actor Geoffrey Arend, has appeared flattered by the global admiration her body type has provoked.

Speaking to an American website, she said: ‘It’s such a compliment, because of all those times I had agents who were like: "you have to lose some weight" and all of a sudden, people are celebrating it.

'It’s like: "Oh thank you! Thank you for letting me be me".'

However the TV star also said that while she appreciates her admirers she wouldn’t encourage women to imitate her.

Speaking about the increase in breast implants in her honour, the actress said, in a separate interview:

‘I hope I am not encouraging that. If there’s anything to be learned from it. It’s that I am learning to celebrate what I was born with’.
