More than 120,000 cyber-attacks are launched every day against computers in Britain.

The 44million attacks a year against home computers, businesses and government are thought to cost the country up to £27billion.

The most common form of attack involves malicious software targeting computers, credit card fraud and hacking of social networking sites.

Hacking of financial details and social media accounts are the most common problems

But a shortage of IT workers is hampering Britain’s ability to protect itself from costly internet attacks, a National Audit Office report revealed.

Worryingly, the lack of classroom computer and technology skills mean it could be two decades before the gap is closed.

The spending watchdog found the number of IT and cyber security professionals in the UK has not increased in line with the growth of the internet.

Its report into the UK’s cyber security strategy revealed concerns in academia, business and government about the low uptake of computer science and technology courses.

In 2010 ministers dramatically upgraded the Government’s assessment of the threat from electronic attack, which now rates as one of the top four risks to the UK. 

Over four years from 2011 an additional £650 million will be spent on the National Cyber Security Programme.

The report also revealed low levels of security awareness among many computer users. According to a survey the top three passwords are ‘password’ ‘123456’ and ‘12345678’. 

It is estimated that around eight in ten attacks could be prevented with better passwords and basic computer security.

NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘The threat to cyber security is persistent and continually evolving.

‘Business, government and the public must constantly be alert to the level of risk if they are to succeed in detecting and resisting the threat of cyber-attack.’

The report said: ‘Interviews with government, academia and business representatives confirmed that the UK lacks technical skills and that the current pipeline of graduates and practitioners would not meet demand.

‘A number of government departments commented that the UK depended on a small number of highly skilled people to participate in developing international technical standards.’

‘Interviewees were concerned about a lack of promotion of science and technology subjects at school resulting in the reported lower uptake of computer science and technology courses by UK students.’
