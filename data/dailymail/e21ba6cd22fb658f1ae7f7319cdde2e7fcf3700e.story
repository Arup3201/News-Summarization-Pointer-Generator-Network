Strain in her face and cigarette in hand, Rumor Willis appeared distressed after visiting mother Demi Moore in hospital.

The 23-year-old dashed to the actress's bedside at a Los Angeles medical centre after she collapsed on Monday night.

It has been claimed that 
49-year-old Demi, who has looked increasingly frail since her split from
Ashton Kutcher, was rushed to hospital after a laughing gas binge at her LA mansion.

No laughing matter: Rumer Willis looked distressed yesterday outside the Los Angeles hospital her mother Demi Moore was rushed to after collapsing following an alleged nitrous oxide binge

Rumer has been seen outside the hospital twice. On the second occasion she obscured her face with sunglasses.

She has been desperately worried about her mother and has reportedly phoned Ashton, who is currently in Brazil, to ask for his help.

A
source told Hollywoodlife.com: 'Rumer is devastated. She worries day 
and night about her mother and has been watching her mom fall apart.

'Rumer actually reached out to Ashton on several occasions and he just 
blew her off.

'He either wouldn’t answer or he’d say he’d help but nothing would happen.'

Frail: Demi looked very slender beside daughter Rumer at an event earlier this month

Demi and Rumer have spent substantial amounts of time together since the split.

After they visited the Turks and Caicos, a source said: 'Demi
was dancing like crazy, she wasn’t acting like a mom … it was wild.

'She
was dancing and Rumer looked mortified and completely embarrassed. It 
was really shocking.'

Earlier this month Demi and Rumer spent an evening at The Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles.

A source told People: 'When [Moore] 
first arrived, she kept to herself ... but she started loosening up and 
getting into party mode.

'She seemed really happy to be out with her 
daughter's friends.

The magazine also claims the actress was flirting with 90210 star Ryan Rottman.

'[Moore]
found ways to touch him all night, and at one point when he was in 
front of her, she was grinding on his butt,' the source told People,

'His shirt came unbuttoned, and she started tickling his bare chest 
playfully.'

Ashton refused to respond when he was
asked about his extranged wife's health yesterday.

He was caught on 
camera by showbiz site TMZ as he was leaving a nightclub in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil.

Ghost actress Demi, who was once married to Bruce Willis, was taken ill on Monday.

A 911 call was made just before 11pm and 
LA Fire Department paramedics were at her house for around half an hour.

They eventually decided that she needed to be taken to hospital.

Reaching out: Rumer is said to have been so concerned about her mother she has tried to contact Ashton, the actor is currently in Sao Paulo

According
to TMZ, the actress had been inhaling nitrous oxide from a small 
metal canister usually used for recharging whipping cream cans in 
restaurants.

A source told 
the website the actress started to show symptoms of a seizure after 
ingesting large amounts of the substance

And a female friend who claimed to be with the 
actress while she was inhaling the gas allegedly told hospital staff she
became distressed when Demi had a reaction and was rendered 
semi-conscious

Showing the strain: Demi has been steadily losing weight over the past few months, her appearance at the October premiere of Margin Call raised concerns about the actress

In happier times: The breakdown of Demi and Ashton's marriage has clearly had a huge impact on her health

Prescription
medication is also reported to have played a part in her 
hospitalisation and that her consistent use was one of the causes of her
marriage collapse to Two and a Half Men star Ashton.

The couple's six-year marriage foundered in 
2011 after Star magazine's shock report that Ashton cheated on Demi with
starlet Sara Leal the weekend of their wedding anniversary.

She announced that she was separating from him but has yet to file divorce papers.

Representatives
for the star refused to directly comment on the substance abuse 
allegations.

But her spokesperson said the actress is seeking 
'professional assistance' after the stresses of recent months.

Insiders have also said Demi was troubled and not looking after herself long before Monday night's hospital dash.

They say the problems began as she endured her break-up with Kutcher.

A
source said: 'Really, it was over the last year her friends saw a 
change. She wasn't sleeping as well, didn't seem to be eating and looked
really gaunt.'
