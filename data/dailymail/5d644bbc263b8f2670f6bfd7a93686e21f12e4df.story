Parents of fourth graders were left outraged after their children were given a class assignment in which they had to draw detailed pictures showing the September 11 terrorists attacks.

Ivie Gremillion was horrified by the drawing her daughter produced in the class. The picture depicted the burning twin towers with people plunging to their deaths yelling, ‘Help’ and ‘I love you.’

Another child given the assignment on Monday, the day before the 11th anniversary of the attacks, drew a picture showing a person falling from the building saying: ‘One way ticket to heaven.’

Disturbing: A fourth grade teacher at Hughey Elementary School in El Paso, Texas allegedly told her class to draw the events of 9/11 including the planes hitting the Twin Towers and people jumping from the building; one girl in the class drew this picture

Alarming: Ivie Gremillion was shocked when her daughter produced a drawing of the 9/11 attacks which had people jumping from burning buildings saying, 'help' and 'I love you' while the pilots of the planes appeared to be laughing. Gremillion says her daughter's teacher gave specific instructions to draw detailed images of 9/11

Gremillion told Fox news that a fourth grade teacher at Hughey Elementary School in El Paso, Texas gave specific instructions to her class.

‘We had to draw the boom cloud, the planes hitting, and people jumping out of the windows,' Gremillion's daughter allegedly said after school on Monday.

The mother claims the teacher explained the attacks to the class, saying: ‘The Afghans did this because they hate all of us and want to kill all of us.’

She is teaching racism and hate about an entire nation, Gremillion said of the teacher.

Her daughter's picture also appears to show the pilots of the planes laughing.

Investigation: School district officials have apologised for the assignment and are investigating whether further action needs to be taken against the teacher at Hughey Elementary School

The aggrieved mother told the news station that her neighbour’s son, who was also in the class, was emotionally damaged by the assignment.

The boy now thinks that terrorist attacks happen every year on September 11 and was terrified to go to school on Tuesday, she said.

School district officials said that they spoke to the teacher who set the assignment. She said that the class had discussed the terrorist attacks  and were then asked to draw something they learned from the lesson.

The school highlighted that some students had drawn pictures of heroic police officers and fire-fighters at the scene. 

Outraged: Ivie Gremillion believes a counsellor should now come in to tell the class about the events of 9/11 ¿ but leave out any of the gruesome details

However, officials said they were still investigating the assignment and apologised for the incident.

Gremillion believes a counsellor should come in to tell the class about the events of 9/11 – but leave out any of the gruesome details. 

She added that her husband 
enlisted in the army because of September 11 and will be deployed to 
Afghanistan by the end of the year.

She said that, following the class, her daughter is now worried that her father is going to die.
