A woman who is now working as a male model has released a video of the life-changing moment when she had her hair cut off.

Elliott Sailors came forward last week talking about her decision to use her androgynous looks in a different way by seeking work as a male model instead of female model.

Now she and her husband have released the video of the emotional moments where she took her place in the barber shop chair and watched as the electric clippers.

The final look: She left her hair longer in the middle to give her some styling options

Excitement: Elliott Sailors decided that in order to make it in the world of male modeling she would have to get her long hair cut off for good

She wrote about the experience in The New York Post, saying that when she went to FSC Barber Shop she had to stand tall and stick to her guns.

'They
 said, “We don’t actually do women’s short-style haircuts.” I laughed 
and said, “I understand. I want to look like a boy,”' she wrote.

'When I sat down in the chair, I told him, “I’m going to cry, but don’t worry about it. I REALLY want to do this.”'

Sailors,
 31, has explained that the decision to drastically change her look is a
 pragmatic one, as she feels that she will be able to stay in the 
industry longer as her career was headed down a catalogue-focused path as opposed to high fashion.

'For the last year I've been focusing on the artistry of it and the creativity of it and not the financial of it,' she told MailOnline. 

'It's not a gimmick that I came up with because I couldn't think of something else

She and her husband Adam Santos-Coy married in 2011 and over the course of their first year as a married couple they had multiple conversations about the prospect of changing her look to work in the male modeling world.

Sailors told MailOnline that he has been extremely supportive, and after she did one photoshoot in August 2012 where she had her long hair styled to look like she was a man.

After that photoshoot, she went to a self-help seminar and she 'got really connected to what it is i am doing in the world.'

'I want to make something else available and possible for people,' she told MailOnline.  

Big step: She warned the barber that she might cry but she really did want to go through with it

Where'd it go: Sailors' husband supports her decision and took her to his barber

Sailors,
 who is 31-years-old, is not the first woman to take this unusual route 
as Casey Legler, 35, was the first woman to be signed on a modeling 
contract for only male gigs, and like Sailors she has no intention of 
taking an permanent steps to physically change genders.

'I cut my hair before she signed with Ford (modeling agency) but when she signed with Ford,' Sailors said of Legler, who she has never met. 

While admitting to MailOnline that she 'was a little bummed about not being the first' she also has 'really gotten aware of the gratitude' that she feels towards Legler and other gender-bending models who have helped pave the way for their particular career path.

The
 fact that Sailors has a first name that is typically used for men- 
Elliott- is just a stroke of familial luck as it is her mother's maiden 
name.

Her mother has been 
just one of the voices against the gender roleplay, but Elliott 
maintains that she is 'just as loving as she's always been'. Once her Tuscon, Arizona-based mother woke up and watched her segment on The Today Show, Sailors immediately called her and checked in that everything was alright.

Exposure: Sailors made an appearance on the Today Show Monday morning and she hopes it will jumpstart her bookings

Her 
husband Adam Santos-Coy has been a constant source of support, and he was the one holding the 
video camera during the landmark haircut and he suggested they go to his
 barber for the big step.

'Tears welled in my eyes again at the first buzz. But I was determined not to have a tear fall,' she wrote in The Post.

'It
 wasn’t so much about my hair — it’s just hair. It was really that I had
 been a model for so long. It’s what I do. It was saying goodbye to what
 I had been and knowing that I was starting something brand new, and I 
had no idea how it would go.'

Androgynous: Before cutting off her hair, Elliott (seen here with her husband Adam Santos-Coy) was regularly critiqued for having masculine features

Standing tall: Sailors' decision has been met with mixed reviews

Different approach: Elliott Sailors decided that instead of getting criticized for her masculine facial features when she booked women's fashion work, she is now pegging herself as a male model

Then and now: Elliott, whose name is her mother's maiden name, used to flaunt her long blonde locks (left) but now has her head shaved at a barber (right)

She
 appeared on The Today Show this morning, and though she has not 
revealed how many bookings she has confirmed in light of her 2012 
haircut, she said that the exposure is a good thing in itself.

'I’ve
 never regretted it. I’m standing for something different to be possible
 in the world — and not just for me. It’s a stand for self-expression, 
transformation and freedom,' she wrote.
