In his smart naval uniform, former town mayor John Roberts looked every inch the ‘Commander’ he liked to be called.

The impressive collection of medals he sported rendered him all the more resplendent at civic events and Remembrance Day parades.

During his time as mayor of Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire – Britain’s third largest port – he was referred to as Commander John Roberts RNR RD (Royal Navy Reserves Reserve Decoration).

Confession: A former mayor of Milford Haven known as 'Commander' John Roberts has admitted that he has never served in the Royal Navy

But questions were raised by locals 
in the seafaring town after ‘discrepancies’ in his uniform and medals 
were spotted – and yesterday Mr Roberts, 80, confessed that he has never
served in the Royal Navy.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed they have no record of Mr Roberts, who did serve in the merchant navy.

Clarifying the situation yesterday, Mr Roberts said he became known as 
‘Commander’ in the town and the title stuck, but it was never an 
official rank.

‘I would like to say that I was not, as some people have been led to believe, in the Royal Navy,’ he said.

‘Confusion arose when I became in command of the British Red Cross in Pembrokeshire, from 1987 to 1992.

‘People started referring to me as Commander Roberts in circumstances which I was not a part of.’

Mr Roberts refused to disclose where his naval uniform and medals had 
come from. He retired last week from the town council and from his role 
as president of the town’s Sea Cadets, citing health reasons.

Milford Haven’s current mayor, Councillor Guy Woodham, said: ‘I have 
been advised that as Mr Roberts has now resigned from the council it 
would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment.

‘Mr Roberts was a town councillor for 12 years and is a past mayor of 
the town. On behalf of the council I thank him for his service.’

Fraud: The former merchant sailor would wear a military uniform and medals to public events

A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘We have no record of this individual ever having served in the Royal Navy or Royal Marines.’

Mr Roberts was Mayor of Milford Haven in 2008-09 and enjoyed an all expenses-paid trip to Qatar as a guest of an energy company.

He served as a county councillor for Milford Haven and was elected as a town councillor in April 2000.

He received three Mayor’s awards during his 12 years on the council .

Mr Roberts joined the merchant navy in 1956 and served more than 30 years at sea before retiring as a senior officer in 1987.

He said he was invited to Buckingham Palace on July 18, 1991, where he 
was recognised for his long service in the merchant navy. Mr Roberts 
added: ‘If I had to write a CV, it would say: I went to sea, I stayed at
sea, and I retired from the sea.’
