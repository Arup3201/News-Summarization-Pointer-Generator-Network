Meriam Ibrahim faces up to seven years in jail over new offences levelled at her by the Sudanese regime, MailOnline can reveal today.

The mother-of-two was told the devastating news after being detained as she tried to fly out of the African country hours after a death sentence against her was dropped.

Dr Ibrahim, 27, was charged with obtaining a false travel document and giving false information to immigration officials - and banned from leaving Sudan.

Cruel twist: Meriam poses hours after her release with her husband, Daniel 
(left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya and all
 those who bravely fought for her freedom in Sudan. Now they have all been thrown back in a jail cell after they were arrested for trying to leave the country

Secrets: The family were seized by the National 
Intelligence Security Services, dubbed the 'Agents of Fear' by Amnesty 
International, which accused them of a catalogue of abuses. They have now been transferred to police custody where they are all locked up together

The move is another twist of the knife as Dr Ibrahim tries to get to America with her two children where she can live with her husband Daniel Wani, a US citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire.

Instead she is back in a cell with her son Martin, 21, and daughter Maya, one month.

Mr Wani is also locked up with them at the Al Sheradee police station in Khartoum after being confronted at Khartoum airport by 40 agents of the feared National Intelligence and Security Services.

It is believed they were trying to travel to Washington DC and Sudanes media have claimed that the US vice consul was with the family at the airport.

Mr Wani told AFP: 'We are worried. that;s why we want to get out of here as soon as possible.'

Dr Ibrahim’s lawyer Shareif Ali Shareif told MailOnline: 'The authorities do not have the right to hold her. They appear not to want to let her leave Sudan. They are restricting her movements.

'Her husband Daniel and the children are with her in the same cell. Any reports suggesting she has been released are wrong. We need to highlight her plight.’

A diplomatic row has now erupted and the Sudanese Foreign Ministry has summoned the American and South Sudanese ambassadors to explain themselves.

Dr Ibrahim had been granted emergency travel documents by the government of South Sudan to travel there and then on to the US. 

Menacing:
 Meriam, her husband and children were detained by 40 National Security 
guards on Tuesday. The Sudanese government have now banned them from 
leaving the country

Mr Shareif insisted that the documents were legitimate and that it was ‘not right’ to claim otherwise.

US Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) launched a blistering attack on the government of Sudan on the floor Capitol Hill today in which he said it had ‘forcibly captured’ Dr Ibrahim.

Standing in front of a picture of Dr Ibrahim and her husband, he said: ‘We need to speak even louder, we need to speak out for Meriam Ibrahim because it is wrong, especially for this young mother, to be subject to torture and murder for being a Christian.

‘That is unequivocally wrong and we need to speak in one voice.’

Earlier in an interview with Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Christian right think tank, Cruz called on President Obama to do more.

He said: ‘We don’t know what their status is, we don’t know if the Sudanese government is going to reimpose the horrific sentence. It’s a powerful reminder - every one of us cherishes our religious liberty and I bet you to say that virtually none of us have had their faith tested as Meriam has had her faith tested.

‘It underscores the need for all of us to lift her up in prayer and it also underscores the need for US leadership.

‘What I have been begging for is for President Obama to stand up and lead...the President needs to say to the government of Sudan: ‘Free Meriam now’’.

Cruz added: ‘Sharia law that would torture and murder a young mother for protesting her religious faith is barbaric, it is wrong and it should be condemned’

Dr Ibrahim was released from the grim Omdurman Women’s Prison on Monday after nine months in custody during which time she was sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery and gave birth to Maya in her call whilst shackled to the floor.

A judge had ruled that she had broken strict Islamic law by failing to renounce her Christian faith and become a Muslim.

'Barbaric': As well as the death sentence for apostasy (the crime of abandoning your religion) Ibrahim was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a Christian

On Monday an appeal court overturned 
her conviction after an international outcry but on Tuesday she and her 
family were detained again.

What
 happens next is unclear - Dr Ibrahim has yet to be granted asylum by 
the US - but so long as she remains in Sudan her life is in danger.

A
 man claiming to be Dr Ibrahim’s half brother went to the prison in 
Khartoum the night she was released and, upon discovering she had been 
freed, flew into a rage and vowed to kill her.

According to CNN, al-Samani al-Hadi, said: ‘The family is unconvinced by the court’s decision.

‘We
 were not informed by the court that she was to be released; this came 
as a surprise to us. The law has failed to uphold our rights. This is 
now an issue of honour. The Christians have tarnished our honour, and we
 will know how to avenge it.’

Speaking
 to Sudanese paper, al-Samani al-Hadi, said that Meriam had been 
'kidnapped' from the family who she should have been returned to, not 
her husband.

'They did not let us know that she was about to be freed. It was a surprise for us,' he said.

Dr
 Ibrahim was detained on Tuesday at the airport by the feared National 
Intelligence and Security Services, who were dubbed ‘Agents of Fear’ in a
 damning report by human rights group Amnesty.

A
 post on the NISS Facebook page said that its agents stopped Dr Ibrahim 
because her temporary travel documents had a US visa stamp on them.

The statement said: ‘This was viewed by Sudanese authorities as a criminal violation and a disregard upon which the foreign ministry summoned the US and South Sudanese envoys’.

Fight for life: Mr Wani, an American citizen, has been fighting for his wife and children's release but his lawyers believe the help he has received from the US embassy has been 'shameful'

The statement added that the document 
was only supposed to be used for somebody travelling to their homeland 
and as Dr Ibrahim would be using it to fly to America it was invalid.

In
 an interview with MailOnline Tina Ramirez, founder of religious freedom
 organization Hardwired, which has campaigned for Dr Ibrahim to be 
freed, has said that the US embassy in Sudan should have foreseen these 
kind of problems.

She said 
that the State Department had been aware of her plight since 2011 when 
she married her husband and that the handling of her case had been 
‘incredibly negligent’.

Ms 
Ramirez said: ‘The US government should have coordinated with the 
government of Sudan to get them out of the country. This is sloppy.

‘I think that Congress should be investigating what happened here.

‘The
 US says that it cares about human rights issues and this is something 
they should be caring about. It’s a total failure, it’s shameful.’

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in her Tuesday briefing that the Sudanese government had assured it of the safety of Dr Ibrahim and her family.

She said the department was talking to Sudanese officials to ‘secure their safe and swift departure from Sudan’.
