On trial: Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London today

Dave Lee Travis told police that alleged sex assault victims were 'jumping on the bandwagon' as he denied attacking a TV personality on the Mrs Merton Show, a court heard today.

The former DJ said the allegation he grabbed a woman's breasts at a BBC studio was ‘totally untrue’, in a police interview read to Southwark Crown Court in London.

Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, told officers he ‘would have been crazy to grope a woman in a corridor’, adding: ‘I absolutely, categorically did not grab her breasts.’

The 69-year-old ex-Radio 1 star told police he did not remember the alleged victim, but it was ‘possible’ he had urged her not to smoke and could have accidentally touched her body.

‘I like to get on with people,’ he said. ‘I don't like to leave people with a sour taste in their mouth. I suspect grabbing someone's breasts for 15 seconds would leave a sour taste in their mouth.

‘What would this be saying to her, “Your breasts are going to fall off if you smoke?”’

He added: ‘There has to be a realisation people can just jump on the bandwagon and have a crack at someone. Anyone could call and say DLT grabbed my a***. It's just too easy.

‘I don't understand why I'm being vilified. I remember the days people used to touch people and you would kick them in the balls. You didn't take them to bloody court.’

Travis said he did not know why the woman had made the allegation. ‘I may have p***** her off,’ he told police. ‘She may have taken a dislike to me.’

In an earlier police interview, Travis said he was a ‘target’ and the allegation he assaulted a woman at a panto he was starring in was ‘utter nonsense’.

He said his former Radio 1 colleague Jimmy Savile was a ‘private person’ with a ‘verbal wall’ and he would have reported him had he known he was a paedophile.

Earlier, the court heard from a comedian who said he had thought Travis was being ‘aggressive’ and not committing a Carry On-style ‘playful' act during the alleged assault on the Mrs Merton Show.

Dave Gorman said the former DJ had appeared as a guest on the comedy chat show when he heard later that Travis had ‘grabbed’ the woman’s breasts in the corridor of the BBC TV studio.

The alleged victim, who was working as a part of the production crew at the time in the mid-1990s, told the court yesterday that veteran DJ Travis got a ‘weird sexual thrill’ as he squeezed her breasts.

She also claimed the former Tops Of The Pops presenter had an ‘intense’ stare during the incident.

Gorman, who was a writer on the Mrs Merton Show, told Travis’s retrial today: ‘I was told that as (the woman) was escorting Mr Travis back to his dressing room, he at some point....grabbed her t***. My recollection was everyone in the team would have known.

‘This was office gossip to some extent. My feeling was, if you think back to that time, the idea we’d call the police and say ‘Dave Lee Travis grabbed (the woman’s) t***’, wouldn’t have gone anywhere.

‘He had been and gone. I recall discussions and questions about whether it had been a sort of ‘Carry On film wahey’, which might be playful albeit ill-judged, or whether it was aggressive. My recollection was it was aggressive.’

The female TV personality, who was in 
her 20s at the time of the alleged assault, told the court yesterday 
Travis had approached her while she was smoking and commented on her 
‘poor little lungs’, before he squeezed her breasts.

She said she ‘froze’ as she was pinned against the wall by the DJ before he let go of her breasts after 10-15 seconds.

Stephen Vullo QC, defending Travis, told the jury that his client has ‘no recollection’ of the alleged victim.

Wearing
 a checked shirt, jeans and trainers, Gorman told the court he could not
 recall who told him about the alleged assault but it was a day or two 
after it was said to have happened.

The
 comic said he had spoken with the alleged victim after she was 
contacted by police and when officers from Operation Yewtree called him,
 he thought it must be about Travis.

He
 told the court the alleged assault ‘was never at the front of his mind’
 over the years but it was not something he had ‘completely forgotten’.

During
 his evidence, Gorman, 43, said he still ‘exchanged Christmas cards’ 
with fellow Mrs Merton writer Craig Cash but the show’s star Caroline 
Aherne was ‘a bit harder to be in touch with’.

Travis, who is charged under his real name David Griffin, denies two counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault.

He
 is facing a retrial on two counts - one of indecent assault of a woman 
between November 1, 1990 and January 31, 1991, and another of sexual 
assault on a different woman between June 1, 2008 and November 30, 2008 -
 on which a jury was unable to reach verdicts at a trial earlier this 
year.

Travis has also pleaded not guilty to an additional count of indecent assault alleged to have taken place on January 17, 1995.
