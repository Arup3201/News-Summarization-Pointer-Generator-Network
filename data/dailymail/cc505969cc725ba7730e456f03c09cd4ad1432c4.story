An all women rowing club whose charity snaps were banned from Facebook have overcome their previous disappointment to launch their third nudist calender.

The university of Warwick rowing society were left devastated earlier this year when photos from their previous calender were branded 'too pornographic' by Facebook and were removed from the site.

The 2014 calender was a huge success selling over 1,500 copies and raising thousands of pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support. 

The University of Warwick rowing society are to release their 2015 nude calender despite heavy controversy surrounding their shoot last year which sure the images banned from Facebook

However the social networking site said that the photos breached their 'pornographic and nudity' laws and removed the black-and-white nude photos - claiming it contained 'explicitly sexual content'. 

Despite last year's controversy the women have remained undeterred and have released images from their 2015 calender containing even more naked images of the rowers claiming it is their best calender yet. 

Featuring 12 members of the university's rowing club, the girls - aged between 18 and 21 - can be seen frolicking in their boat house on the River Avon in Barford, Warks.

Last year's calender shots were dubbed 'too pornographic' by the social networking site, so this year the images will not be added to Facebook

This will be the Rowing Society's third nudist calender in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support

The young women are hopeful that their third naked calendar will be met the same success of their previous efforts having raised a whopping £5,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support over the years.

Although January is still a little way off the girls have already received 200 pre-orders from across the globe for their 2015 calendar, including from the Gay and Lesbian Rowing Federation in Boston, USA.

Third year history and politics student Sophie Bell, 20, from Upminster, Essex, who helped organised the 2015 calendar, said the girls have not held back with their latest efforts.

The girls have raised over £3000 for the charity with their previous calendar sales

'We were all disappointed when the page was removed because we are students so social media is one of the main ways we market and advertise the calendar.

'It really hurt us when it was branded as porn because that is exactly the opposite of what we want to do.

'We are all strong-minded women and our first thought is to make sure the shots are tastefully done so it makes a calendar we can all be proud of.'

Despite not being able to market the calendar on Facebook the girls have received 200 pre-orders from around the globe 

Sophie admits that they did have their concerns regarding marketing the calendar without the help of social media, but says that they have already received a phenomenal response.  

'We have raised over £3,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support and thought we might struggle to sell as many of the 2015 calendars without Facebook.

'Thankfully, due to the support of our loyal fans, they saw sense and put the page back up again and the girls are really looking forward to selling as many as we can to our fans all over the world.'

The society have received an order all the way from Boston USA from the Gay and Lesbian Rowing Federation

Sophie added that the warm weather really helped the girls to relax in their photographs and produce some of their most successful images yet. 

'This year's shoot was done in June at our boat hose at Barford along the beautiful River Avon when we had some amazing hot weather.

'The girls really got into the spirit and I think the final images make this our best ever calendar.' 

And the girls hope they can raise even more money with their latest more risque version, which is priced at £8.99, and is released 14 October.

It can be purchased from www.warwickshirerowing.org or by contacting the students on their Twitter page @nakedgirlsrow.
