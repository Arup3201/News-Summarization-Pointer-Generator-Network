So-called Jeopardy 'evil genius' Arthur Chu used his controversial 
gamesmanship Monday to claim yet another victory on the quiz show.

The
 30-year-old Ohio insurance professional took home $20,800 that he'll 
add to the $102,800 he's already won since he first began his winning 
streak January 28.

Despite the criticism being near constant since
 his winning began, it doesn't look like Chu will start conforming to 
more accepted tactics any time soon.

Jeopardy anti-hero: Though unpopular, Arthur Chu's (left) tactics again won him the game on Monday despite getting the Final Jeopardy question wrong

According to Jeopardy College champ Keith Williams, however, Chu's streak could come to an end quickly and with no warning.

'He
 could easily reel off five wins this week, or get tripped up by a 
tricky Daily Double or Final Jeopardy! clue,' Williams told ABC News. 
'That's the beauty of Jeopardy! -- it's so unpredictable.'

But Williams admits that Chu's risk averse style eliminates as much of the luck factor as possible.

In
 Monday's game, Chu's hardest-questions-first strategy left him with 
more than four times the winnings of the second place opponent by the 
game's final question.

Chu lost $10,000 when he incorrectly 
answered a question about a famous abolitionist of the 19th century 
admired by Frederick Douglass.

However, after both his opponents also failed to correctly answer John Brown, Chu and his tactics won the day.

He'll be back on Tuesday's pre-taped episode to battle to maintain his status as the game's most loathed returning champion.

Arthur calls the strategy, which aims 
to disarm his opponents, Forrest Bounce, after successful 1980s player 
Chuck Forrest who also 'bounced' around the board.

The strategy sparked outrage across social media last week as viewers accused Chu of 'unsportsmanship'.

No sweat: Chu missed the question about abolitionist John Brown but he'd already entered the final round with four times the winning of his nearest opponent and easily won the day

A little bit different: Arthur Chu, 30, (right) Jeopardy's latest and greatest star, has used Jeopardy game theory to become nightly must-see TV. But his unorthodox methods have made him a polarizing figure

But Chu has consistently dismissed the furor, telling Fox News: 'Like any game, strategy plays a big role.'

He
 added: 'I can't change your impression of me but, again, we're playing 
for money. Between $10,000 and getting haters on Twitter, $10,000 is 
more important to me.'

The 
so-called 'evil genius', as dubbed by angry Twitter users, has also 
received support from the show's host Megyn Kelly, who said Arthur 
'seems to get' the concept of winning.

Arthur is quick and confident with his answers, darting from a $1,000 question to $200 for seemingly no reason.

But he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as Philly.com are calling him a 'hero', whilst others blogs like BarStool describe him as a 'mad genius'.

Arrgh: Arthur's game-play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure

Before appearing on the show, Arthur claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years.

'I
 decided pretty early on, you know, I'm not going to be able to learn 
all the things I don't know in terms of actual knowledge,' he says.

'You
 only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out
 for the show. So I said, 'What's the strategy that'll serve me best on 
the show?' It seems that people don't actually think about the strategy 
of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge.'

Typically,
 contestants choose a single category and progressively move from the 
lowest amount up to the highest, giving viewers an easy-to-understand 
escalation of difficulty.

However,
 because Arthur is finding the hidden Daily Doubles, which are normally 
located within the three highest-paying rungs in the categories, it  
means rather than building up in difficulty, he ends up starting with 
the most difficult questions.

After a couple of the most difficult high-stakes questions have been answered, he moves over to another category.

It can be a frustrating watch because it doesn't allow the viewer to get into each subject matter and viewers aren't given enough to time to get in a rhythm or fully comprehend the new subject area but Arthur defends accusations that he is being 'unsportmanlike.'

Contestants often avoid topics they 
unsure on, Arthur was playing tactically: if he lost, the most it would 
cost him was $5, and either way, it would take the Daily Double out of 
play for everyone else in the game.

Host Alex Trebek and the audience giggled when the question came, Arthur immediately blurted out 'I don't know.'

It
 wasn't a waste of a Daily Double, as he kept that question out of the 
hands of the other contestants. Winning in Jeopardy just means beating 
the other two, and his strategy made that possible.

Other haters online dislike Arthur for his incessant buzzer-clicking but Arthur defends his gameplay.

'There's
 no logical reason for most people to play the game the way they do it -
 start at the top of one category and then go all the way down until you
 finish it,' Arthur says.

'The only control you have in the game is
 the ability to pick where the next question is gonna be. If you have 
that advantage and you jump around the board, you can put the other 
players off their game. That's your advantage, and you don't just want 
to give that up for nothing.'
