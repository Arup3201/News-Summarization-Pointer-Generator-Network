A Brit hailed as the world's greatest living fisherman has vowed to turn into a real-life 'Jaws' hero - and stop a great white shark that is heading towards Britain.

Zyg Gregorek has caught dozens of sharks, including the infamous great white, during a lifetime of extreme fishing all over the world.

And the 70-year-old, from Halwill, Devon, is now preparing to turn into the real-life version of the shark hunter played by Robert Shaw in the film 'Jaws'.

Zyg Gregorek, 70, from Halwill, Devon, says he expects a fight if he is to keep great white shark 'Lydia' away from British shores

Experts have tracked a great white shark, which they have called Lydia, as it swims towards Britain

But the pensioner insists he won't 
harm the fish - thought to be pregnant - but insists his mission is to 
weigh it and move it into safer waters before releasing it back into the
 wild.

The massive shark - 
called Lydia - is currently being tracked by scientists in the US who 
have attached GPS devices to its back to record its movements.

Experts have been following the 15ft beast, who weights 2,000lbs, for over a year as part of a ground-breaking ocean life study and her progress can be followed on their website.

The shark appears to be making her way across the Atlantic towards the UK coastline and Mr Gregorek is the perfect man to meet her.

The grandfather-of-five holds a string of world records after spending decades chasing fish across the globe.

He said: 'I've caught Great White Sharks in the past - they're very strong and are good fighters so I'd expect to battle with it for a few hours before catching it.

'I know I'm no spring chicken but I'm confident I could take it on - it would be like fighting a miniature bull but I've got all the experience behind me to do it.

'When you're out there battling with a shark you don't have time to get scared - it's man versus monster but adrenaline will keep me going.

'You just have to pace yourself and try and forget about the pain - it's mind over matter.'

He has been compared to 'Quint', the shark hunter played by Robert Shaw, who famously sings 'Show Me the Way to Go Home in Steven Spielberg classic Jaws.Â 

Extreme fisherman Mr Gregorek landed a different Great White Shark - which weighed in at 1300lb - off the coast of South Africa in 2000

Mr Gregorek says he would use 'rubby dubby' to tempt Lydia in - a practice of luring fish by leaving mashed up fish guts in a trail behind the boat.

He will then use a 130lbs line with a 50lbs clasp to hook the shark while standing on a 20ft catamaran.

Mr Gregorek, who lives with wife Rose, 63, at a holiday fishing complex, normally uses a 'fighting chair' - like that used by Quint in Jaws but says he will be tackling this shark standing up.

He said: 'I would have to capture the shark standing up as there are no 'fighting chairs' available which makes the catch it a lot more tiring.

'The chair has a rod hold and a harness so it's much easier and there's no need to stand up, but they're very expensive and I'm not aware of anyone who has one in the UK.

'Though I'd have two skippers on board I wouldn't have any help catching the shark as I have too much pride.

'Great White's aren't the toughest to capture so I'd feel quite confident - Tiger Sharks seem to be the most difficult to catch.'

Mr Gregorek has caught two Great White Sharks in the past - one being a 1300lb off the coast of South Africa in 2000.

In 2007 he was declared the world's greatest fisherman after becoming the first person to catch all 27 species in the three so-called 'royal slams' set by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA).

He travelled 150,000 miles to some of the world's most remote locations to snare nine species of shark, ten species of billfish and eight species of tuna.

In 2012, Mr Gregorek became the first recreational angler in history to catch five different species over 1000lbs.
