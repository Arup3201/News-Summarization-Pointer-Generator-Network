A veteran BASE jumper has died after crashing into a
mountain in California when his stunt went disastrously wrong.

Walden Grindle, who married nine months ago, leapt from a
peak north of San Francisco on Sunday in an attempt at speed-parachuting. Speed-parachuting differs from BASE jumping as it involves using a parachute to take off from a mountain rather than leaping off a vertical cliff.

But Grindle's flight went failed and he collided with sheer rock face.

Grindle was able to make one last call to his wife, telling her that he had a broken hip, but when help arrived 30 minutes later he had
died.

Grindle, 35, had also activated an emergency beacon. Authorities were dispatched at 12:40 p.m and they found Grindle dead at about 1:10 p.m.

The avid BASE 
jumper and thrill-seeker had hiked up a fire trail with a parachute on 
Sunday to the top of Mount St. Helena  and jumped off.

'You stand there with your chute open and the wind pulls you up like a kite,' Capt. Tracey Stuart explained.

Grindle earned dual degrees from the University of California at Davis in electrical and computer engineering.

He was once arrested for jumping off El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. He had also previously been hospitalized after a head injury he incurred during a skiing stunt in January 2012. 

On his Facebook page, he said he was trying a double back flip when he hit his head. About a week later, he had a seizure and went to the hospital, where he stayed for a couple days.

About a month after the accident, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Danielle. They were married in December 2012. 

According to a website for the couple's wedding, Grindle's hobbies included skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, skydiving, wingsuiting, BASE jumping and speed-flying, many of which he often enjoyed with Danielle.

BASE jumpers leap from
high places including buildings, cliffs or other perches, and parachute
down. The acronym stands for 'Buildings, Antennas, Spans and Earth.'

Grindle also loved to travel, with his most recent destinations including Switzerland, Japan and Alaska.

A shame but his wife knew what she was marrying. it was obviously his passion so im sure she went along with it as she married him. R.I.P. and condolences to his widow.

I would rather live life to it's fullest doing what I love and be with someone who does the same. Accidents can happen to even couch potatoes. Blue skies Walden!
