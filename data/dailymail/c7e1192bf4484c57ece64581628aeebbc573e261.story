Village greens across Britain could be under threat after a developer won permission to build on a beloved beauty spot despite a decade-long court battle by campaigners fighting to save the land.

A property company plans to build around 80 homes on a 46-acre patch of grassland near Weymouth in Dorset, known as Curtis Fields, which was officially registered as a town green.

A passionate group of activists have spent nine years and £100,000 in a bid to stop the courts stripping the land of its protected status, but last week the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the developer.

Conservationists have warned that the 
decision could endanger Britain's 4,000 other town and village greens by
 boosting builders' scope to overturn legal protections.

At risk: Curtis Fields in Weymouth, Dorset is set to built on after campaigners lost a bid to preserve it

Activists: Gill Taylor, right, has led the campaign to preserve the land for communal use

Curtis Fields, also called Markham and Little Francis, was granted town green status in 2001 on the grounds that it had been used freely by locals for at least 20 years.

But when development firm Betterment Properties bought the plot in 2005, they applied to remove the protection so that they could develop the site.

Local residents formed the Society for the Protection of Markham and Little Francis to block the application in the courts.

However, in 2010 the High Court ruled that the land should be stripped of its town green status because its use as a recreation ground did not in fact stretch back for the requisite 20 years as it was used as farmland until the mid-1980s.

Threat: Betterment Properties, which owns the land, is planning to build on it and restrict public access

Status: Curtis Fields was officially registered as a town green in 2001, but that decision has been overturned

Campaigners spent £100,000 taking the 
case to the Court of Appeal and then the Supreme Court, arguing that the
 landowner had waited too long to appeal against the town green 
registration.

2001: Curtis Fields is officially registered as a town green.

2005: The land is bought by Betterment Properties, which appeals to overturn the registration.

2008: Local residents form the Society for the Protection of Markham and Little Francis in order to fight the company's claim.

2010: The High Court rules in favour of Betterment on the grounds that the land was not used as a green for long enough.

2012: The Appeal Court turns down the campaigners' appeal as Betterment reveals plans to build on the land.

2014: The Supreme Court rejects the residents' argument that the company waited too long to file its application.

Last week, Britain's highest court ruled in favour of Betterment - leaving the society with an additional legal bill of £15,000, which they plan to repay by holding fundraisers.

The failed campaign was supported by organisations such as the Open Spaces Society and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, which are worried by the knock-on effect of the decision.

Kate Ashbrook, general secretary for the Open Spaces Society, said: 'We are dismayed by this decision which gives a green light to developers to grab our village greens.

'It invites them to unpick the laws which were intended to protect land which local people have cherished for recreation, and to challenge whether the land should have been registered as a green.'

Alastair Wallace, a lawyer who 
represented the campaigners, said: 'This case will encourage speculative
 developers to re-look at green areas, because the registration of town 
green status is now worthless.

'This
 is like Sainsbury's getting permission to build a supermarket, and then
 four years later a green activist comes along and overturns the 
planning permission and Sainsbury's have to pull down their store.'

Fears: The failure of the battle to save Curtis Fields could endanger other pieces of land used as town greens

One reason for the initial High Court decision in favour of Betterment was that the local council used outdated legislation to determine the award of town green status.

Gill Taylor, chairman of the Curtis Fields campaign group, fears that other developers will now try to find similar minor errors in planning decisions in order to overturn legal protections.

'This is a huge blow, but if we had not stood up and challenged the application to deregister the town green people's rights would have been lost without any fight,' she said.

A spokesman for Betterment Properties said: 'We have no wish to deprive anyone of the use of this land. We will allow everyone to continue to enjoy the same use as they have had in the past until we require the land for other purposes.'

The village green is central to the 
vision of traditional English life in the countryside, and for centuries
 certain patches of land have been recognised as having a special status
 within rural communities.

However,
 it was not until the creation of the Commons Registration Act in 1965 
that greens were first afforded formal legal protection.

The
 law - now determined by the Commons Act 2006 - allows local residents 
to apply for town or village green status for any plot of land which has
 been used by the community for at least 20 years.

The land has to be used 'as of right' - that is, openly and without asking permission from the owner - in order to qualify.

It
 is forbidden to build on, interfere with or fence off registered town 
greens, meaning that registrations are often opposed by landowners who 
fear their property plunging in value.
