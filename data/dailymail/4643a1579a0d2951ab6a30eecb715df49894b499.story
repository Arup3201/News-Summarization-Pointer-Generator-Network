A three-year-old who was given an egg as an Easter present was not allowed to have his name on the chocolate - because he shares his name with footballer Wayne Rooney.

Rooney Scholes, from Manchester, was told that having just Rooney on the egg would cause 'copyright issues'.

Yet UK law states that a person's name can not be subject to copyright.

Rooney Scholes, three, from Manchester was not allowed to have his name written on the egg because of 'copyright issues. His mother Jo-Anne (R) called the shop's behaviour 'barmy'

His mother, Jo-Anne Scholes, said that staff at Thorntons in Bury town centre, near Manchester, would not inscribe Rooney's name on the egg because they were concerned they would be breaching copyright.

But staff agreed that the little boy could have his full name, Rooney Scholes, on the chocolate.

Mrs Scholes said: 'It's madness because why have they agreed to put his full name on it?

Rooney is named after Manchester United player Wayne Rooney (L). The surname of the family is coincidentally the same as retired player Paul Scholes (R) who spent his career at Manchester United

'Surely if they can't do one then they can't do both, it's beyond belief'

Mrs Scholes is a huge Manchester United fan and also has a tattoo of former player Eric Cantona on her arm.

She also has two cats called Cantona and Berbatov, named after Bulgarian player Dimitar Berbatov who left United in 2012.

She said that she did not think Wayne Rooney 'would be bothered in the slightest' because he has children of his own .

'What should have been a nice surprise for Easter has turned into a total farce,' she added.

Mrs Scholes branded the shop's behaviour 'barmy'.

The mother-of-four from Rochdale said: 'It’s just pathetic that they wouldn’t let a childhave his name on an Easter egg for fear of upsetting Wayne Rooney.

'It’s just nonsense anyway. Rooney is his name, does that mean he’s not allowed to have his name on anything because he shares it with a famous footballer?'

She said that she had been upset by the fact that Rooney could not just have his first name on the egg because it made the present 'impersonal.

She said having his full name on the chocolate looking 'a bit silly really'.

'My neighbour Janet actually bought the egg for Rooney as a treat but the staff told her point blank that they wouldn't put his first name on it because of copyright,' Mrs Scholes said.

Mrs Scholes other son is called Anderson but the choice preceded the arrival of Brazilian footballer Anderson who has now left the club.

She said that she called her youngest child Rooney as a tribute to the man who has been her favourite player 'for years' 'just because of his style of play and the way he carries the team'.

'I had a couple of nervy moments when it looked like Wayne might be off to Chelsea in the summer but thankfully he stayed where he belongs,' she added.

A spokesman for Thorntons 
said: 'Thorntons apologises for the service provided to Ms. Scholes at 
the weekend.

'The Company does abide by copyright laws but these were not
 applicable in this case.

'Our free Personalising Easter eggs service is 
something that our customers enjoy and are usually delighted with and we
 are very sorry that this was not the case in this instance.'

A spokesman for Wayne Rooney declined to comment. Staff at the store refused to comment on the incident.

According to England & Wales Baby Names, in 2002, the same year Rooney burst onto the scene at Everton, three babies in Britain were named Rooney.

The following year, 2003, seven babies were given the name. In 2004, the year he joined Manchester United, the number of babies given the name was eight, bringing the total over three years to 18.

The name flopped in 2007 when no parents imitated the footballer - perhaps reflecting England's poor showing at the 2006 World Cup - but in 2008 was resurrected again when three babies used the name.

For three years 2009-2011, no parents picked Rooney as a name for their newborn before five babies called Rooney were brought into the world in 2012.

Since 1999, 42 babies have been named Rooney, according to records.

The last recorded data from 2012 showed that the most popular boy's name was Harry.
