A drink-driver has been shamed on Twitter by police after he crashed his car next to a neon sign - warning about the dangers of drink-driving.

The unnamed man left his car parked at a 90 degree angle and wedged next to the lamppost which had a matrix sign reading 'Don't drink and drive'. 

The motorist was breath tested at the scene in Cheltenham, Gloucester, where he gave a reading of 75mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - almost twice the legal limit. 

He was immediately arrested on suspicion of drink driving on Sunday evening.

Gloucestershire Police later tweeted the picture of the car with the message: 'The irony is attached to the lamp post.

'Driver arrested on suspicion of drink driving - blew 75 at the roadside.'

It comes after a woman was arrested on suspicion of drink driving after two police officers were seriously injured when they were hit by a car yesterday morning in an unrelated incident in the West Midlands.

The officers both suffered broken legs when the Blue VW Golf GTi ploughed into the back of a car they had just stopped.

The force of the smash sent the Mercedes E350 hurtling into the officers before the Golf hit the pair - sending them flying through the air.

An officer, in his 40s, who has served with the force for 11 years was knocked unconscious and sustained a broken leg.

His colleague, a PC also in his 40s and who has served with West Midlands Police for 13 years, suffered serious fractures to both legs.

The officers were given emergency first aid by colleagues at the scene in Tipton, before specially trained firearms officers arrived to give assistance.

They were rushed to hospital where they remained yesterday evening. The driver of the Golf, who is from the Dudley Port area of Tipton, was trapped in the car and needed to be cut free by firefighters.

She was taken to hospital with a suspected broken shoulder where she was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and will be questioned when she is released by medics.
