Fly-half Quade Cooper has finally ended speculation surrounding his future by signing a new two-year deal with the Australian Rugby Union and Queensland.

It will be unwelcome news for the Lions, who will face the Wallabies in three Tests next year.

Cooper has been shrouded in controversy after publicly declaring the Wallabies had become a 'toxic environment' in September.

His comments on Twitter and in interviews upset both teammates and Wallabies coach Robbie Deans.

He was fined 60,000 Australian dollars and offered an incentive-based contract with the ARU last month, which he rejected.

Details of the latest offer have not yet been released, but it is rumoured that the fly-half turned down an offer from a French club that would have made him one of the richest players in the world in order to continue playing for Australia.

The British Lions face Australia for three Tests next summer and the 24-year-old said: 'It’s no secret that I have a strong passion and desire to represent Queensland and Australia. I love playing for the Reds and the Wallabies.

'It’s a great feeling to know that things are sorted and now I can continue to improve as a player and as a member of the Queensland Reds and the Wallabies.

'I’m confident I’ll front for round one in peak physical condition and primed to play the best rugby in my career.'

Acting ARU chief executive Matt Carroll added: 'This means Quade Cooper and the Reds can now focus entirely on the upcoming 2013 Super Rugby season.

'Quade can now look forward to getting back on the field next year and playing for the Reds and in turn stake his claim for re-selection in the Qantas Wallabies squad.

'Next year is an exciting year for Australian Rugby with the British and Irish Lions venturing to our shores for the first time since 2001.'

Reds director of coaching Ewen McKenzie is looking forward to having Cooper and Will Genia, who recently signed a new deal, in the halves next season.

Both players featured in last year's clash with the Crusaders as the Red's took their first Super Rugby title.

'We have been preparing as if Quade and Will were both going to be around next season, so nothing much changes in that respect,' McKenzie said.

'Obviously we’re targeting winning the championship next year, so it will be good to push on with our preparations without the peripheral noise.

'Even some of our Wallabies have started to filter back into the set up this week, so it’s good for our environment and culture.

'We’re all working towards 2013.'
