 He is accused of raping and strangling teenage beauty queen Bronwynne Richardson - his own cousin -  and dumping her battered body in  the Murray River 40 years ago.

Colin Newey was only 20-years-old when, according to police, he abducted 17-year-old Richardson from outside Coles in the NSW border town of Albury, strangled her and took her body along a picturesque walking trail and left it in a lagoon.

But the broken down 61-year-old, who a judge says is a convicted thief and arsonist as well as alcohol and drug abuser, is due to be released from a NSW jail and will be allowed to return to his home in South Australia.

Abducted, raped and murdered: Four decades after teen beauty queen Bronwynne Richardson (pictured) was abducted, raped and murdered in the NSW border town of Albury, police arrested  cousin, Colin Newey, and charged him with killing the 17-year-old  in 1973 and dumping her batterd body in a lagoon

Sexual attraction: Colin Newey, 61 (pictured after his arrested in July this year) was the 20-year-old cousin of Bronwynne Richardson when, police allege, he raped and murdered her partly because of his sexual attraction to the teenage beauty queen. But a judge has let him out of bail, saying there is little useful evidence to convict

Bronwynne Richardson (pictured, left and right)) had just finished work at Coles in Albury on the evening of October 12, 1973 and was waiting for a lift home when a car pulled up and she was dragged into the vehicle, then raped, strangled and murdered. Her body was dumped in the Murray River and found two days later at Horseshoe Lagoon, 6km west of where she had been taken

Justice Richard Button has granted Colin Michael Newey bail because 'there is no scientific evidence such as DNA to implicate' Newey in the four decade old crime, the Nine Network reports.

Police hailed it as breakthrough in the case in July, when detectives from the NSW Unsolved Homicide Team travelled to South Australia and arrested Newey and charged him with Ms Richardson's 1973 abduction, rape and murder.

Despite numerous police statements by eye witnesses, two inquests, charges laid against three men but no convictions, Ms Richardson's family have endured decades in limbo since the 17-year-old's violent slaying.

Police say Colin Newey was sexually attracted to Ms Richardson (pictured after the 17-year-old won her beauty crown at the Corowa Show in 1973) who he allegedly raped and strangled and then dumped her body in a lagoon on the Murray River

It was just after 7pm on Friday, October 12, 1973 when Bronwynne Richardson was on a footpath in Smollett Street, in central Albury, waiting for a lift home following her shift working at Coles.

Earlier in the year the 17-year-old had won a beauty contest at the Corowa Show, being crowned Miss Corowa Show Beauty Queen in the town which lies 50km west along the Murray River from her home in Albury.

A car pulled up on Smollett Street and Ms Richardson was dragged into the vehicle. She was driven to a reserve off a road about 6km west of Albury, where she was raped and beaten.

She was then strangled and her body was dumped in the Murray River.  Two days later, on Sunday, October 14, her body was  from Horseshoe Lagoon, on a walking trail in West Albury.

Police investigated the murder but were unable to determine who was responsible.

In 1975, a coronial inquest found that Ms Richardson died of strangulation and drowning.

In 1990, based upon new information, a fresh investigation was launched and three men were charged in connection with the crime, however none of them were convicted.

In 2008, the newly-formed Southern Region Unsolved Homicide Team commenced an investigation into the case under Strike Force Kulaman and a number of new lines of inquiry were established.

Another coronial inquest in 2011 resulted in more fresh information being presented, providing police with their strongest line of inquiry to date.

Police arrested Colin Newey in July in Murray Bridge, 75km south-east of Adelaide, and extradited him back to Sydney and placed him in prison to await a murder trial.

Newey applied to the NSW Supreme Court for bail on Thursday in a hearing in which the Crown alleged he was in part motivated to murder by his sexual interest in Ms Richardson, and had been making 'salacious comments' about his cousin prior to the killing.

But Justice Richard Button said in the Supreme Court that the accusations against Newey were founded on the evidence of a 56-year-old witness who had been 17 at the time of the alleged comments.

He described Newey as a 'petty criminal' and with long-standing problems over alcohol and cannabis abuse, and convictions for stealing, arson and driving offences going back decades.

In 1974, Newey had been convicted and fined the 'surprisingly small' amount of $40 for possessing a silencer.

But he had never been convicted of a serious offence, the court heard.

And Justice Button contended that 'there is a real dispute that the Crown can prove the accused was the person or one of the persons who committed those actions'.

He granted Newey bail and ordered he may return home to Murray Bridge under strict conditions.
