It might sound like something straight out of a James Bond film, but this diamond-encrusted, bulletproof suit could be yours - if you have a spare $3.2 million (£1.9 million).

Covered with more than 880 gems, the Diamond Armor suit repels both bullets and stains and even has built-in air conditioning to keep the wearer cool in hot climates, and temperature-raising situations.

Its makers, Zurich-based SuitArt describe the garment as the 'world's most expensive men's dress suit'.

Bulletproof: The suit combines luxury and technology. It is waterproof thanks to nano-technological sealing, as well as being bulletproof (illustrated). The Diamond Armor suit is encrusted with 880 black diamonds decorating the buttons and the lapel

The suit is made from lightweight material incorporating bullet-proof fibres made by Croshield.

It features an air conditioning system that can be activated at the push of a button.

Nanotechnology means the suit is waterproof and dirt-resistant as the fabric has a special coating inspired by plant leaves.

The garment includes 180 black diamonds that each has a diameter of 4mm and a total weight of 140carats.

A silk lining is decorated with artwork by Luciano Goizueta, which featured in the film 'This Means War'.

There is also a matching limited edition watch available.

'Characterised by technical refinements the suit will be custom tailored for the customer,' the company added.

The suit fabric is encrusted with 880 black diamonds, while the lapels and stitching featuring 600 black diamonds measuring 4mm in diameter each, with a total weight of 140 carats.

The jacket buttons are made from steel and embedded with 280 black diamonds.

The suit is bulletproof as it uses a technology invented by Croshield - a firm that makes bulletproof vests and helmets - with ‘level II’ protection classification.

This level of protection means it can shield the wearer from bullets fired from handguns ranging from 9mm pistols to .57 Magnums.

If people don’t already feel cool enough wearing the suit, then the garment also comes with built-in air conditioning.

‘The integrated technology, which can be activated at the push of a button, allows for highest comfort by cooling the wearer down through the humidification of water,’ according to SuitArt. 

The suit also comes with inbuilt air conditioning (pictured left) that can be activated at the push of a button to keep wearers cool under pressure. The fabric is woven to be bulletproof and stops a bullet (pictured right) penetrating the wearer's body using layers of specially-designed fibres

The Diamond Armour suit won't need cleaning very often, because its outer layer is created from a nanotech process, inspired by the leaves of plants, which makes it waterproof and dirt resistant.

The suit also features a silk lining printed with a painting by Costa Rican artist Luciano Goizueta.

While there are no photos of the garment itself yet, the artwork and details will surely impress James Bond wannabes.

There is a matching watch available for the extravagant suit too. There are only 125 Carl F. Bucherer 'Patravi traveltec fourex limited edition' watches being made and one of them (pictured) belongs to the Diamond Armour suit and 'perfects the appearance,' the company said
