A woman who cost taxpayers £160,000 by making 160 needless calls to ambulances and health services to secure morphine has been banned from calling 999 for two years.

Vicky Davies from Ynysybwl in Rhondda has been handed an Asbo to stop her 'shocking' behaviour and has been warned she faces prison if she calls the emergency services unless it is a genuine emergency.

According to a report from Rhondda Cynon Taf council, the authority joined forces with the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust and Cwm Taf Teaching Health Board to secure the Anti-Social Behaviour Order against Davies - who has no medical or psychological issues.

Pontypridd Magistrates' Court was told the 43-year-old made more than 160 calls to emergency and non-emergency health services in the past two years - at an estimated cost to the health services of £1,000 a time.

Once on board the ambulances, she attempted to secure morphine and entonox.

Once her desire for the drugs was fulfilled, she walked out of hospital, the report stated.

The court also heard that due to her aggressive, abusive and improper behaviour, the number of staff treating her had to be doubled.

This, in turn, put further strain on services and took valuable resources away from genuine medical cases. 

The case against her was presented to the court by experts from the council's anti-social behaviour team, as well as specialist officers who deal with prolific offenders in the ambulance health service.

The case for a full Asbo was considered on earlier this month,10 days after Davies was served an interim Asbo, banning her from calling 999 except in the case of a genuine emergency.

In this 10-day period, she made a further 10 demands for emergency services, but did so via friends and family.

She did not contest the order or the evidence presented and accepted the ASBO.

She is now banned, until August 2016, from calling 999 or requesting an ambulance through another person unless in the case of a genuine emergency/life-threatening situation that requires an immediate response.

Pontypridd Magistrates Court, pictured, heard that Davies was aggressive, abusive and displayed improper behaviour towards hospital staff 

She is also banned from attending any accident and emergency department unless in the case of a genuine requirement or pre-arranged appointment and, having once done so, to remain in the hospital until discharged.

She must not use a mobile phone or recording device while being treated by paramedics or doctors, the order continues, or while being transferred to hospital by ambulance, or request that she is treated with entonox or morphine.

Paul Mee, of Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, said: 'Vicky Davies is a resident whose shocking behaviour had to be curbed for the sake of others who genuinely need emergency services.

'She has been told she will go straight to prison for any breaches.'

Richard Lee, of the Welsh Ambulance Service, added: 'Davies' actions placed a great strain on the ambulance service in this community and prevented others from getting the medical attention they needed, so we hope this order will bring an end to her unreasonable behaviour.'
