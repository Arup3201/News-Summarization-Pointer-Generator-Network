A real Boeing 777 takes 50 days hundreds of people to build, but one student has 
created an impressive miniature paper version of the jetliner.

Luca
 Iaconi-Stewart crafted the incredible replica aircraft using only glue and manila cardboard 
folders, and it contains tiny details from padded airline seats, to fan 
blades in the engines and even retractable landing gear.

The 
22-year-old thinks he could have finished the model - which is almost 
complete – if he had worked on it non-stop for a year, but said it would
 have been ‘a hellish experience.’

Luca Iaconi-Stewart crafted the replica aircraft using only glue and manila folders. So far it has taken him over five years

Instead, Mr Iaconi-Stewart 
has spent over five years building the 1:60-scale jetliner in his spare 
time, while attending college.

He first learned to build models out of paper at high school and his love of airplane led to his mammoth project.

‘I
 was lucky enough to go to a high school with an amazing architecture 
department, which was a huge source of inspiration,’ Mr Iaconi-Stewart 
told MailOnline.

The student uses photographs and designs on which to base his drawings and designs for the model airplane. It all started when he found a detailed diagram of an Air India Boeing 777

The model contains tiny details, from padded airline seats, wings built with a structure similar to the real jetliner (pictured right) and even retractable landing gear (pictured left)

Mr Iaconi-Stewart says it is hard to describe exactly how the plane came together but explained that he made the fuselage (the aircraft's main body section)  first - which took several attempts - before building the seats and cabin compartments and furnishing the interior

‘We learned to build simple manila folder 
"massing" models of basic structures, and I suppose I took that concept 
to the extreme with this model plane.

‘I've been interested in
 aviation for many years, and this project combines my love of airplanes
 with my love of art and design,’ he added.

After finding a 
detailed diagram of an Air India 777 online, Mr Iaconi-Stewart started 
drafting his own plans for the model using just a pencil and paper.

The airplane was constructed from manila folders (pictured), glue and a lot of patience

‘I
 traced a can to make the perfectly circular fuselage cross-section, but
 I soon hit a wall, where it became impractical to keep designing this 
way, which forced me to start using the computer,’ he explained.

‘These days, I look at photos and/or engineering drawings and use them to draw up my own plans in 2D.

‘I
 use Adobe Illustrator -  though it isn't at all intended for my 
purposes - and I then print onto the folder, cut out the parts, and 
assemble,’ he said.

the fuselage (the aircraft’s main body section)  first – which took

furnishing the interior.

After building the main body of the plane, Mr Iaconi-Stewart re-skinned the nose and tail (pictured), built the tailfin and horizontal stabilisers and painted the fuselage

He uses Adobe Illustrator to print the pieces he designed onto a manilla folder so that he can cut out the parts and assemble them into intricate pieces like this

The student paid very close attention to photos, diagrams and plans of Boeing's 777 aircraft to make sure he got all the deatils of the jetliner correct - down to the curtains and door mechanisms

He then re-skinned the nose and tail, built the tailfin and horizontal stabilisers and painted the fuselage.

‘The engines were done in the middle of that process - often I'll switch to a different component when I get bored,’ he said.

‘I've essentially made two planes, with many of the early attempts being discarded,’ Mr Iaconi-Stewart said.

‘I’m starting on the wings now, which I expect to take several months. They're the final components, thankfully,’ he added.

It is hard to believe that the intricate opening on the left is made from just manilla folders and glue. Mr Iaconi-Stewart now uses a computer to design and print out the precise little pieces needed to make airplane components (pictured right)

He explained that he has essentially made two planes, with many of the early attempts being discarded, but has now honed his technique to create details such as this opening with a curtain, which looks like an airplane kitchen

As
 he is not designing in 3D, Mr Iaconi-Stewart said it was tough to come 
up with the plans, especially for parts with unusual shapes like the 
engines and wings.

‘Assembling these parts can also be incredibly
 challenging. I only recently discovered how to make the paper truly 
bend in three dimensions,’ he said.

‘Other parts are challenging 
simply because of how monotonous they can be to assemble. There were a 
huge number of economy seats to build and I was luckily able to watch 
movies and TV while I put them together, but it was still a gruelling 
process.’

Mr Iaconi-Stewart said it is rewarding to be able to replicate a part with a high degree of accuracy.

‘Seeing
 the model come together feels like a tremendous accomplishment, as 
difficult as it's been to get to this point. When it's done, I can only 
imagine how relieved I'll feel.’

While he has no idea what will 
happen to his model airplane, he hopes it will eventually find a place 
in a museum collection as it is something he would like people to be 
able to see in person, as well as in snapshots on his Flickr page.

‘Many
 people have told me that they've sent photos to friends who work at 
Boeing, but Boeing itself has yet to contact me directly,’ he added.

While
 Mr Iaconi-Stewart said he loves making models, he thinks he is ‘ready 
to try something different’ after the plane is completed.

‘As 
great as it will be to see this come together, it's really sucked a lot 
of energy out of me, and it can be very isolating at times, so it's not 
something I'd immediately jump back into,’ he said.
