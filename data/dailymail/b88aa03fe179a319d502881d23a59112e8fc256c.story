Gareth Bale would be perfect for Manchester United and has the potential to turn them into Barclays Premier League title contenders next season, according to Paul Scholes.

Bale has been linked with a move away from Real Madrid as he continues to be criticised by their supporters, and even had his  Bentley attacked by fans following their 2-1 defeat by Barcelona.

Scholes insists the world's most expensive footballer at £86million would have no such worries at Old Trafford, where he would be loved and could have as big an impact as Eric Cantona.

'My feeling is that he would be perfect for Manchester United,' Scholes wrote in his column for the Independent. 'Of course, as a fan of my former club I would like to see him there but, looking at it objectively, I always felt that Bale was a natural fit for United as he developed at Tottenham from a left-back into one of the best attacking footballers in the country.

'He would be loved at Old Trafford. In return I believe he could turn Louis van Gaal's team into serious title contenders next season.

'In my years at United I witnessed some signings who, over their careers, transformed the fortunes of the team. From Eric Cantona when I was an apprentice, to Dwight Yorke, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney. 

'These were great footballers who became great United players. Bale has the potential to make as much of an impact as any of them.'
