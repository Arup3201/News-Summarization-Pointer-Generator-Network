A father of four, who applied for a one-way-ticket to live on Mars, could be looking at a divorce as a result of his extraterrestrial ambition.

Ken Sullivan made it the next stage of the Mars One project, which could potentially see him making a new life on Mars – but his wife and children are not happy about the news.

Mr Sullivan, who lives in Utah, is among the 1,058 applicants selected so far who could colonise the red planet and never return to their families and friends on Earth.

While the 38-year-old might be excited about his potential ticket to an extraterrestrial life, his wife of five-and-a-half years, Becky, is contemplating getting a divorce.

‘The question is do we get divorced now or get divorced later. If I stand in the way of his dreams and passions, then we get divorced now, so I have to be supportive,’ she told The Salt Lake Tribune.

If he did make the final cut to live on Mars, Mr Sullivan would also have to leave behind his four children, who range in age from just six months to 13-years-old.

His 12-year-old daughter Kaitlyn is upset at the idea she might never see her father in person again and said that she would miss him, yet her older sister Jocelyn told the newspaper: ‘If he wants to go to Mars, he should go to Mars.’

Colony: The mission will aim to set up a permanent manned outpost on the Red Planet which could later expand and the first 24 participants will die on Mars

The Mars One project needs to raise $400,000 (£245,000) by 25 January to fund its plans.

Once enough funding has been raised, the Dutch firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016.

A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018.

The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips ‘much safer than moon missions’.

The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade.

Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.

The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison, Nasa's rover Curiosity cost £1.8 billion.

The older children have already had a long-distance relationship with their father who worked as a contractor in Iraq fixing helicopters.

The first Mars One mission is set for 2024, by which time his older children will have grown up, but his younger daughters will still need their father.

Mr Sullivan hopes that the mission is delayed so that his youngest daughter Tana will be around 18-years-old.

‘I just hope the family will be able to forgive me down the road,’ he said.

‘Hopefully there isn’t too much hatred of my being selfish in pursuing a dream that isn’t theirs.’

There
 is only a slim chance of Mr Sullivan being selected to live on Mars, as
 just 24 people will be chosen, but his wife is sad that he did not ask 
her opinion before completing the application form and said that she 
could not contemplate leaving her children.

However,
 Mr Sullivan says he loves his family more than Mars, but also wants to 
be the first to live on the Red Planet and make a name for himself.

He
 admits that he will be relieved if he is not selected as he will not 
have to make the difficult decision, but also said he will be 
disappointed if he is not among the chosen 24.
