German-born aviation pioneer Gustave Whitehead is finally getting recognition after Connecticut legislators have passed a bill insisting he flew two years before the Wright brothers

Connecticut legislators have passed a bill insisting that a Connecticut aviator flew two years before the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, N.C.

The measure is the latest twist in an effort to credit the first successful airplane flight to German-born aviator and Bridgeport resident Gustave Whitehead.

He was born in Leutershausen, Bavaria as Gustave Weisskopf.

As a boy, he showed an interest in flight, experimenting with kites and earning the nickname 'the flyer'.

His parents died in 1886 and 1887, when he was still a boy. He then trained as a mechanic and traveled to Hamburg, where in 1888 he was forced to join the crew of a sailing ship.

After several years at sea he arrived in the U.S. in 1893 and anglicized his name to Gustave Whitehead.

The bill honors what it calls the first powered flight by Whitehead in 1901, ‘rather than the Wright brothers.’

Whitehead is credited by some for the first flight in August 1901. The Wright brothers lifted off from North Carolina in December 1903.

‘We want to correct something that should have been corrected long ago,’ said state Rep. Larry Miller, R-Stratford, who spearheaded the legislation.

‘All we're trying to do is correct history. There's nothing in it for us.’

Tom Crouch, senior curator for aeronautics at the Smithsonian Institution, which displays Wilbur and Orville Wright's plane at the National Air and Space Museum, said Whitehead's backers are ‘absolutely wrong.’

‘Whitehead's legend has spawned much speculation and hearsay,’ he said. ‘People who have looked at this over the years... almost unanimously reject the claim.’

Gov.
 Dannel P. Malloy has not committed to signing the legislation, but will
 review it when it reaches his desk, a spokesman said.

Whitehead's wife Louise wasn’t a big fan of his obsession with flying.

In 1940 she gave an interview to The Bridgeport Sunday Post in which she
 said her husband's first words upon returning home from Fairfield on 14
 August 1901, were an excited, 'Mama, we went up!'

Mrs. Whitehead said her husband was always busy with motors and flying 
machines when he was not working in coal yards or factories.

The interview quoted her as saying, 'I hated to see him put so much time
 and money into that work.'

History rewritten: Wilbur and Orville Wright face being written out of history now that the Whitehead story has been given credability

Whitehead designed an aircraft in the 
early 1900s that could be driven like a car, but was fitted with wings 
that could be unfolded, turning the car into a plane. 

He envisaged owners being able to drive 
the car to a field, or suitable runway and then unfold wings on the side
 of the vehicle that would then turn the car into a plane.

Whitehead then built his Condor aircraft, also known as No.21, based on this flying car model.

The aircraft had two 
engines; a 20 horsepower engine used to fly the vehicle, and a 10 
horsepower engine used for driving.

The idea was that the pilot could switch between engines depending on whether they wanted to drive or fly the vehicle.

Condor was also fitted with two propellers that were controlled and powered when the plane engine was selected.

Reports in the Bridgeport Herald in 
August 1901 claim Whitehead drove the Condor to a field outside 
Connecticut, unfolded the wings and made two demonstration 
flights. 

During the second flight, Whitehead is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet.

Further reports claim he updated the 
model, called No.22, and made another demonstration flight on 22 January
 1902 in front of 17 witnesses. 

Mrs. Whitehead said her husband's aviation 
efforts took their toll on the family budget and she had to work to help
 meet expenses.

She said she never saw any of her husband's reported flights.

Connecticut
 has a long and storied history in aviation. Aircraft engines were made 
at Pratt and Whitney in East Hartford beginning in 1925, and a desk used
 by Charles Lindbergh is still on display at the jet engine 
manufacturer. And famed helicopter maker Igor Sikorsky set up shop in 
Stratford in 1929 to make seaplanes.

A
 recent burst of interest in Whitehead followed a documentary by an 
Australian historian, John Brown. In addition, Whitehead Research 
Committees in the United States and Germany have stoked interest.

Jane's
 All the World's Aircraft, an influential industry publication, recently
 cited contemporary news accounts in concluding that Whitehead beat the 
brothers from Dayton, Ohio, into the air.

Andrew Kosch, a high school science teacher in Milford, said he has been working 30 years to promote Whitehead's achievement.

He lobbied the legislature and even 
persuaded Chip's Family Restaurant in Fairfield to name an omelet the 
No. 21, for the plane Whitehead flew.

A report in the Bridgeport Herald on 18 August 1901 details eyewitness accounts of Whitehead's flight, which took place in Connecticut four days earlier. The journalist confirms that the flight took off from Fairfield, flew for about a mile and a half, made two turns and then landed safely

He said the aviator is well-known in Connecticut for flying before the Wright brothers and the world now needs to know it.

‘How can you prove someone didn't fly? That's what the Smithsonian is trying to do,’ Kosch said.

He
 and Miller said the Smithsonian is forbidden by a contract with the 
executors of the Wright brothers' estate to admit that anyone else was 
the first to fly.

Crouch
 said the Smithsonian signed a contract with two heirs of the Wright 
brothers' estate in 1948, after the brothers' deaths. The heirs insisted
 on the provision, he said, because they fought a fraudulent claim of 
early flights for 20 years.

It doesn't change what he said is the fact that Wilbur and Orville Wright operated the first heavier-than-air machine.

‘What
 they achieved changed the face of the world,’ he said. ‘They were the 
ones who took those final steps. They deserve the credit for it.’

Kosch will not be persuaded to reject Whitehead.

‘I do everything I can to keep the story alive,’ he said.
