After a week of misery, the end is finally in sight for passengers aboard the nightmare Carnival cruise ship as the vessel makes the last leg of its journey in to port today.

The ship's 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members have been stuck on the Carnival Cruise Lines’ 'Triumph' in the Gulf of Mexico since Sunday after a fire in the engine room crippled the power system.

Passengers reported how the four day luxury cruise then turned into a nightmare as carpets became soaked in urine and scare food supplies left them with nothing to eat but cold sandwiches.

Their horrendous journey will finally end today with the ship expected to arrive at Mobile in Alabama around 4pm. But the cruise company is still offering passengers a 15 per cent discount just in case they want to do it all again.

The Miami-base cruise line has said passengers aboard the ship will 
receive a full refund for the cost of the cruise as well as transportation costs, pre-paid shore 
excursions, gratuities, and government fees and taxes. 

But the company is also offering the passengers 25 per cent discounts on future three to five day Carnival 
cruises or a 15 per cent discount on a six or seven day cruise. 

The ship left Galveston, Texas, for a four-day cruise last Thursday and was about 150 
miles off Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula when an engine room fire knocked out its primary power source on Sunday.

The blow-out crippled the ships water and plumbing 
systems - leaving it adrift on only a backup power.

'Toilets are overflowing in the cabins, we are having to sleep in the hallways. Onion and cucumber sandwiches last night.

'Cabin carpets are wet with urine.'                              Debra Rightmire, passenger

'No power, no water, having to use the bathroom in bags.'                  Gary Keyes, whose wife is on board

'People are fighting over food and stuff - that's a bunch of savages.'      Brent Nutt, whose wife Bethany is on board

'We have no power AT ALL, which means we can't use the toilets, wash our hands, or take a shower'

Passengers have reported that cabin carpets are soaked in urine leaving many forced to sleep in tents on deck.

The
 first tug boat reached the Carnival Triumph on Monday night and began 
towing the vessel to Mobile, Alabama, at the rate of a few miles per 
hour.

Reports say that there are only five working bathrooms for the more than 3,000 passengers on board.

The rest are being asked by the crew aboard the vessel to urinate in cabin showers and defecate in bags.

Ann Barlow told CNN: 'It's disgusting. It's the worst thing ever.'

She
 told the network that the staff have been helpful, but that is doing 
little for the putrid conditions, including the unbearable heat and long
 lines for food and bathrooms.

Another passenger, Debra Rightmire, texted ABC: 'Conditions are getting worse by the hour. Cabin carpets are wet with urine and water.

'Toilets are overflowing in the cabins, we are having to sleep in the hallways. Onion and cucumber sandwiches last night.'

Another Donna Gutzman wrote: 'There's no lights, no water, we can't flush. Some people were able to shower.'

Those on board were only able to make contact with land via their phones when sister ship, the Carnival Legend pulled up alongside to drop off limited supplies on life rafts. 

Holidaymakers have 
been forced to sleep outside as there is no air conditioning in
 their sweltering cabins.

Some passengers have no 
options other than bags or buckets for toilets with reports of 'raw sewage running down 
the walls'.

Coming to the rescue: Another Carnival cruise liner called the Legend went off course to help the other boat but dropping off supplies proved difficult in high seas, according to one passenger

The news came 
amid claims that those on the ship have turned into 'savages' and are 
fighting over food, relatives said.

Passengers reportedly have been queuing up
 to four hours to get a hamburger.

David
 Raynes, from New Hampshire, is on sister ship the Carnival Legend.

He 
took a picture of passengers on the Triumph on Monday, lined along the 
top deck, staring out to sea.

He
 wrote on Facebook: 'Our ship shuttled supplies to them, which was not 
an easy task due to the wind and high waves – it was hard for the boat 
they were using to get up close to the other cruise ship and then back 
to ours. They made at least two trips.

'Another ship, the Conquest, came along 
to bring more food to them. We could hear announcements from the 
Triumph, and their guests cheered when they heard the news that a 
tugboat was just 17 miles away. It arrived before we left. We were there
 about five hours.

The Triumph made a pass by us and the guests cheered and waved to us.'

CBS Houston reported that
 500 passengers are McDonald's workers from the Houston area, mostly 
local franchise owners and executives of the restaurant chain.

The ship is listing to 4.5 degrees and although not dangerous, the angle of the boat is 'not normal and would definitely be felt by passengers walking around', an expert told MailOnline. 

A 25-mph south-southeasterly wind has made it too difficult to tow the ship to its original destination of Progreso, Mexico, so the vessel has changed course and is heading north to Alabama. 

Carnival Cruise Lines president and CEO, 
Gerry Cahill, said: 'All guests on the 
current Carnival Triumph voyage will receive a full refund for the 
cruise, along with transportation expenses. 

'In addition, they will receive a 
future cruise credit equal to the amount paid for this voyage, as well 
as reimbursement of all shipboard purchases during the voyage, with the 
exception of gift shop and casino charges.

He added: 'We're terribly sorry for the 
inconvenience, discomfort, and frustration our guests are feeling.

Saving the day: Another ship called the Conquest also turned up with food for stranded guests on the Triumph

Getting a tow: The ship is now being taken to Mobile, Alabama, where it is expected to arrive later today

'We 
know they expected a fantastic vacation, and clearly that is not what 
they received. Our shipboard and shoreside teams are working around the clock to care for our guests and get them home safely.'

Carnival Cruise Lines has since canceled a dozen more planned voyages aboard the Triumph and acknowledged that the crippled ship had been plagued by other mechanical problems in the weeks before an engine-room fire left it powerless in the Gulf of Mexico.

The ship is expected to finally dock in Alabama around 4pm today.

Passengers' stay in Alabama will be limited, Carnival said in a statement late Wednesday.

The company said passengers were being given the option of boarding buses directly to Galveston, Texas, or Houston, or spending the night in a hotel in New Orleans, where the company said it booked 1,500 rooms.

Those staying in New Orleans will be flown Friday to Houston. Carnival said it will cover all the transportation costs.

No shock: Previous passengers of the Carnival Triumph said the were not surprised, citing engine trouble on past journeys. The ship's troubles on this trip has left passengers fighting over food and toilets and sleeping in tents on the decks to get out of their sweltering, air conditioner-less cabins

Journey: The ship left Galveston, Texas, for a four-day cruise to Progreso, Mexico, last Thursday but broke down about 150 
miles off Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula after an engine room fire on Sunday
