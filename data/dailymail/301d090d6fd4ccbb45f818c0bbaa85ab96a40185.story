Eighteen years after a teenager's naked body was found floating in a Utah river, police have arrested a convicted murderer thanks to DNA from a cigarette butt.

Michael Simpson, 46, from Florida, is 
being held on suspicion of aggravated murder in the killing of 
17-year-old Krystal Lynn Beslanowitch, whose bloodied and broken body 
was found on December 6, 1995, along the Provo River in Utah.

The lead investigator at the time, Wasatch County Sheriff Todd Bonner, flew to Sarasota County to help take Simpson into custody. 

After years of dead-end leads, DNA 
technology improved and last January, investigators finally got a match 
on Simpson from evidence at the scene, authorities said.

To corroborate the evidence, Bonner and 
another detective flew to Florida on August 25, and were able to get a 
new DNA sample from Simpson from a discarded cigarette after following him for days.

Though it is not clear how or if the two knew each other, Krystal's mother told The Deseret News in 1996 that her daughter was involved with drugs and was prostituting by age 15.

'Every time she came home she had her arms spread out wide and a big smile on her face. I never refused her. I always loved her,' Linde Toreson said at the time. 'Whatever she was doing (she thought) was more important than living a normal life.'

Krystal and her boyfriend had only moved to Utah from their home town of Spokane, Washington, just five months before she was killed.

He reported her missing two days after she failed to return from a late-night trip to a Salt Lake convenience store.

Bonner said at a news conference yesterday that he was thrilled at 
the arrest, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

'It's a case that's haunted me for 
almost my whole career,' he said, adding that Krystal's parents  were 'relieved and emotional' at the news and happy it was moving forward.

Previously, Simpson was charged with second-degree felony murder in 1987 and pleaded guilty two months later, according to Utah court documents.

He was paroled from the Utah State Prison in April 1995, and was free at the time of Krystal's slaying, according to Utah Board of Pardons and Parole records.
