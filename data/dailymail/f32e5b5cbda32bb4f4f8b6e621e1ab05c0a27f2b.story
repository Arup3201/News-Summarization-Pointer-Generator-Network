Britain will swelter in a heatwave next summer, the Beckhams will move back to the UK for good and X Factor will finally call it a day, according to the public's predictions for 2013.

Less optimistically, a number of people foresee nations leaving the EU, a leading bank prosecuted for fraud and the NHS crippled by strikes.

Research company Opinium asked 2,012 adults what they thought might happen in 2013, ranging from economic and political issues to sporting and showbiz ones.

Welcome back: More than one in 10 people polled believe the Beckhams will swap the U.S. for the UK. Pictured are David and Victoria Beckham and sons (L-R) Cruz Beckham, Romeo Beckham and Brooklyn Beckham

Sunny outlook: A total of 10 per cent believed the UK is due a scorching summer in 2013

Glory: 14 per cent think Andy Murray will go on from his U.S. Open and Olympic triumphs and finally win Wimbledon

The top prediction saw 34 per cent believe at least one country to leave the EU next year. But this time last year in the same survey, 47 per cent had said this too and were wrong.

But their crystal ball-gazing should not be mocked as, 12 months ago, they also got plenty right, include Kate Middleton's pregnancy and Facebook shares going public.

This time last year many also predicted the divorce of Katy Perry and Russell Brand, although many may argue this was less a feat of clairvoyance and more a sense of inevitability.

This year's predictions for 2013 include
32 per cent who believe a leading bank will be involved in a major 
fraud or other illegal scandal.

Almost three in ten (29 per cent) think the Liberal-Conservative coalition will fall apart and 28 per cent think that interest rates will finally rise in the next 12 months.

Away from the economy, 17 per cent predict falling ratings for X Factor mean next year's series will be the last.

Despite the current icy weather and a couple of years of washout summers, 10 per cent still predict next year will see a heatwave.

Andy Murray's success at the Olympics and US Open have convinced 14 per cent he'll win Wimbledon at last and 15 per cent think the Beckhams are coming back to the UK for good.

Less cheerfully, 16 per cent believe 
the current growth in employment will come to an end and the job 
situation will get worse next year.

X Factor axe: Nearly a fifth believe X Factor will get the chop after falling viewing figures

Cracks: More than a third believe one or more countries will leave the EU in 2013 after a restive year for member organisations

And 13 per cent forecast that NHS staff will go on strike after reaching breaking point over government cutbacks to the health service and public sector, said Opinium's figures

Managing director James Endersby said: 'Judging by the correct predictions from last year, we have some mystic Brits in our midst who can tell the future.

'We can't wait to see what the next year brings and whether the nation's forecast for 2013 will ring true.'
