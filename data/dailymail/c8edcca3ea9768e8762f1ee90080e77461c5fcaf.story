Tony Pulis has spoken in depth for the first time about his time as Crystal Palace manager and his dramatic departure from the club.

Speaking to the BBC’s Football Focus in an interview to be aired on Saturday, Pulis says he risked his reputation by taking the job last November and revealed that Sir Alex Ferguson was one of few people who told him to do so.

Pulis won Barclays Premier League manager of the year in May after guiding Palace to an 11th-placed finish but left the club before the start of the season.

The former Stoke manager’s relationship with co-chairman Steve Parish quickly disintegrated and Pulis departed by ‘mutual consent’ just two days before the start of the season.

Referring to the time when Parish convinced Pulis to succeed Ian Holloway at Selhurst Park with Palace languishing in the bottom three, Pulis said: ‘Steve Parish was very persistent, I think he spoke to me on three occasions.

‘I spoke to a lot of people and a lot of people said “no, it wouldn’t be a club to go in to”, for all sorts of reasons.

‘I spoke to Sir Alex (Ferguson), I spoke to Peter (Stoke chairman Coates), those two were the people who said it could be done, it wasn’t an impossible job. They mentioned about the crowd, about the supporters being 110 per cent behind the team.

Pulis admits he likes 'a challenge' and getting Palace out of the relegation zone was certainly a challenge

Steve Parish visited Pulis and contacted him three times as he was keen for him to take the job

Sir Alex Ferguson was one of only a few people who told the former Stoke boss that the move was a good idea

‘Steve came down to Bournemouth and we actually sat down in the house and that was the first time I thought: “I’m going to do this. I’m going to take the challenge”.

‘Obviously you put your own reputation on the line. Everybody knows I’ve never been relegated.

‘They were in a dreadful position at the time. But it was a challenge and, as you know, I do like challenges.’
