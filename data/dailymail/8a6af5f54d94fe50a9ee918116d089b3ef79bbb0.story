City girl: Billie Piper in London earlier this week

She put her wild child past behind her and settled down to a quiet family life in the country.

But seven years later, it seems Billie Piper has finally tired of her rural idyll and is moving back to the bright city lights.

The 32-year-old actress and her actor husband Laurence Fox, 36, have put their secluded Sussex cottage up for sale and bought a smart townhouse in north London.

Miss Piper – who shot to fame playing the companion in Doctor Who and a prostitute in the TV drama Secret Diary of a Call Girl – has been flooded with work after struggling to find roles for several years.

She is currently in stage farce Great Britain at London’s National Theatre and recently played a poor Irish immigrant in Sky Atlantic drama Penny Dreadful.

Meanwhile Mr Fox – who is best known for starring in ITV detective drama Lewis – is busy recording a music album and made his own West End appearance in Strangers on a Train at the Gielgud theatre.

It seems the young couple, who are parents to two sons Winston, five, and Eugene, two, no longer have time to relax in the countryside.

When they married in 2007, they settled down in a picturesque, oak-timbered cottage near Midhurst, West Sussex, which they bought for £725,000.

They soon learned to appreciate its views of rolling fields, large garden and friendly village pub, and bought a horse called Chutney, two pics named Boris and Barack and three chickens.

Mr Fox seemed to appreciate the rustic simplicity even more than his wife. In 2011, he said he loved their ‘boringly normal’ life, adding: ‘I never liked London. I always said I wanted to live in the country. I’m an outdoorsy sort of person; I go fishing, take my dog out to the pub.’

But it seems Miss Piper, who often says she is less laid back than her husband, began to tire of the good life, especially when he had to spend time in Los Angeles looking for acting work.

She told an interviewer she began to feel bored in the countryside after the birth of their first son. She said: ‘I did go a bit Sylvia Plath down there. Staring at the condensation on the window and wondering where it comes from.

‘Following slugs in the garden that hadn’t moved a foot, and feeling a bit desperate. Laurence was filming when I first had Winston. I’d had an emergency caesarean and I could barely walk. I was alone in the country with a new born baby for three weeks.’

And it seems couple’s elderly neighbours did not immediately warm to the actress thanks to her racy reputation and role in ITV’s Secret Diary of a Call Girl.

In 2010, she revealed: ‘A few of the older locals actually believe I’m a whore. They love Laurence because he’s in Lewis — his fan club are in their mid-60s upwards.

‘It’s sickening. They look at me and they are like, “That s***! How could you dirty yourself with her? She’s corrupted you”.’

Two years ago, the couple sold their horse after it threw Mr Fox off repeatedly, rehomed the pigs at a nearby farm when they became too big to keep in the garden and gave the chickens to their local pub.

Last year, they paid £1.7million for a four-bedroom house in north London.

Now they appear to have decided to stay there for good as their acting careers flourish in the capital, putting their Sussex home up for sale with an asking price of £825,000 last month.

While she may prefer city life, it appears Miss Piper has not yet adjusted to the busy London traffic.

She was recently quizzed by police after she collided with a cyclist while attempting a U-turn in her Volkswagen Golf near their home. She was not arrested or charged.
