A man goes on the rampage as he flees his captors in an office block - in what looks like a real-life version of a 'first-person shooter' video game.

But this is not the start of Die Hard 6. It's a music video that has gone viral, with almost 16million hits on YouTube.

What follows is precisely 4 
minutes and 57 seconds of carnage, as seen from the point 
of view of our escaped 'hero': lots of bad guys are variously dispatched via
pool ball, knife and guns; a dog is thrown out of a window; and, for 
good measure, there's some bikini cleavage.

Created by Russian indie band Biting Elbows, the song is called Bad Motherf***er' - and it's proved so successful, it has attracted the attention of Hollywood agents.

The goons set a dog on the man. The video has gone viral since its March release, with nearly 16m hits on YouTube

The man soon stops the dog ripping his arm off... by throwing the beast out of a window

It was directed by the band's frontman, 29-year-old Ilya Naishuller.

Since its release in March, he has even received a congratulatory tweet from U.S. film director Darren Aronofsky, whose works include The Wrestler and Black Swan.

Naishuller achieved the 'point-of-view' first-person effect by super-gluing a GoPro 'wearable' camera to a helmet.

A crew of 40, including a team of stuntmen, helped to realise his cinematic project.

And the CGI effects were so realistic that YouTube initially banned the video as it thought a dog was really thrown from a window.

The company changed its mind when the director explained it was a toy dog stuffed with 12kg of bricks.

In conversation with bigthink.com, Naishuller refused to divulge the budget as it was covered by a sponsor.

The narrative centres 
around the struggle for possession of a magic blue lightbulb that acts a
teleportation device.

We see this in action as our hero 'pings' mid-scuffle to a snowy landscape - and later, a child uses it and disappears.

As the unnamed man continues his 
escape, he leaves the building in which he was held captive, slotting 
dozens of goons in the process, commandeers a car, and flees across 
rooftops, parkour-style.

At this point, he encounters ladies in bikinis.

The narrative concerns the struggle for possession of a magic blue lightbulb teleportation device. The film, also known as Insane Office Escape 2, is a sequel to the band's earlier video Stampede, aka Insane Office Escape. Above, a baddie is killed by being trodden on

The film is a sequel to 2011's The 
Stampede, also known as Insane Office Escape - in which a man goes on a 
killing spree to acquire the special device stored in an office vault.

He is eventually caught, bringing us to his present predicament.

Not surprisingly, the latest single also goes by the title Insane Office Escape 2.
