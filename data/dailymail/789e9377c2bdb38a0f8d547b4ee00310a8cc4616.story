Fly-tippers face losing the cars or vans they use to illegally dump old furniture and rubbish.

Under tough new laws, enforcement officers are to be given the power to seize vehicles from outside offenders’ homes or businesses without having to go to court for a warrant.

They will then be able to keep them for up to 30 days while an investigation is carried out.

Last year, councils reported 852,000 fly-tipping incidents in England, which cost taxpayers more than £4 million to clear.

The new law, due to come into force next spring, will focus on ‘cowboy’ firms that undercut legitimate waste companies by dumping rubbish from building sites and industrial premises anywhere they can find.

It will also target individuals who scar the countryside by getting rid of household waste from the back of their car.

As well as losing their vehicle, those found guilty could be imprisoned for up to five years and fined up to £50,000.

Peter Box, of the Local Government Association, said: ‘Giving councils tougher penalties will allow them to tackle this criminal activity head-on. It is inexcusable and unacceptable for anyone to dump waste illegally, and councils know how much people hate seeing this sort of vandalism.’
