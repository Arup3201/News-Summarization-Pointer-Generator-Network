An unnerving video of a woman on the verge of losing consciousness on a bus in Philadelphia while her young daughter attempts to keep her awake has sparked an official investigation.

The four-and-a-half-minute was posted to Facebook on Thursday via a page called People of Septa, which was set up to mock to the kinds of people that travel on SEPTA buses in Northeast Philadelphia.

The clip immediately went viral, with more than 38,000 shares.

The Philadelphia Police Department's Special Victims Unit and the Department of Human Services have each confirmed they are investigating.

Heartbreaking: The young woman, allegedly under the influence of heroin, can barely keep her eyes open, is unresponsive and constantly slumping over

Disturbing: The young girl, said to be seven-years-old, can be seen in the video trying to prop her mother up and asking what is wrong

The young mother - who has not been officially charged, according to police - seems moments away from passing out

The woman appears to be on the verge of passing out and leans forward as her daughter holds her head up to stop her from falling over.

According to NBC10, the child is seven-years-old and the mother is allegedly under the influence of heroin.

While police say they were glad to be made aware of the video, they lamented the other passengers on the bus for ignoring what was obviously a serious incident.

'While it is helpful that so many people emailed and called us after viewing the video, there were many people on the bus who witnessed this as it was occurring and took no action at all,' DHS Commissioner Anne Marie Ambrose said.

'Child abuse is a community problem, if you see or know that a child is being abused or neglected, you should report it immediately.'

Philadelphia Police Lieutenant John Stanford agreed.

'We don't want people to engage because you don't know what's going on here,' Stanford said.

'But we'd prefer you to call 911 or stop the operator of the vehicle.'

Police say they identified the woman and took her in for questioning.

She is believed to have lost custody of her daughter, however no charges have officially been filed.

Police also have not confirmed whether the woman was under the influence of drugs or alcohol while she was on the bus.
