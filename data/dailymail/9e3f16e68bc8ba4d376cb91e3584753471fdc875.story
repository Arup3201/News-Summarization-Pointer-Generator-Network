As any bleary-eyed plane passenger will confirm, a crying baby is almost impossible to ignore, no matter how hard you try.

Now scientists believe they may have worked out why.

An infant’s wails pull at the heartstrings in a way that other cries don’t, researchers found.

Researchers found that the sound of a baby crying can trigger unique emotional responses in the brain, making it impossible for us to ignore them - whether we are parents or not.

Just milliseconds after registering 
the cry, the brain’s emotion centres are hard at work. It had been 
thought that the brain was incapable of processing complex facets of 
sound in such a short time.

Other types of cry, including calls 
of animals in distress, fail to elicit the same response – suggesting 
the brain is programmed to respond specifically to a baby’s cry.

A team of Oxford University scientists scanned the brains of 28 men and women as they listened to a variety of calls and cries.

After 100 milliseconds – roughly the time it takes to blink – two regions of the brain that respond to emotion lit up.

Their response to a baby’s cry was 
particularly strong, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in
New Orleans heard. The response was seen in both men and women – even 
if they had no children.

When we hear a baby cry, after 100 milliseconds, roughly the time taken to blink, two regions of the brain that respond to emotion light up.

The response occurs in both men and women - and in people who have no children of their own.

Experts say the response 'make sense' from an evolutionary perspective.

Researcher Dr Christine Parsons said:
‘You might read that men should barely notice a baby and step over it 
and not see any of them but it’s not true.

‘There is a specialised processing in
men and women which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that 
both genders would be responding to these cues.

‘The study was in people who were not
parents, have no particular experience of looking after babies and yet 
they are all responding at 100ms to these particular sounds, so this 
might be a fundamental response present in all of us regardless of 
parental status.’

Fellow researcher Katie Young said it
may take a bit longer for someone to recognise their own child’s cries 
because they need to do more ‘fine-grained analysis’.

The team had previously found that our reactions speed up when we hear a baby crying.

Adults performed better on an arcade 
game requiring speed, accuracy and dexterity when they were played the 
sound of a baby crying than after they heard recordings of adults crying
or high-pitched birdsong.

The findings could help shed light on
post-natal depression – where mothers struggle to bond with their 
newborn – by showing how a healthy brain responds to a baby’s cries.

The researchers found the sound of a crying baby was triggered within 100 milliseconds of hearing it
