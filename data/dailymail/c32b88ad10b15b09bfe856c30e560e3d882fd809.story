Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw misled MPs over Britain’s involvement in the rendition of two Libyan terror suspects into the hands of the Gaddafi regime, court papers allege.

Abdel Hakim Belhadj and Sami al-Saadi are suing the British Government, its intelligence agencies and Mr Straw for helping transfer them illegally to Libya, where they were tortured.

Mr Belhadj and his wife were seized in Malaysia in 2004 and flown to Tripoli on a CIA jet, which it is claimed flew via Diego Garcia, the British territory in the Indian Ocean. The ‘rendition’ took place just weeks before Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, signed the so-called ‘deal in the desert’ that reinstated diplomatic and trade links with Colonel Gaddafi.

Mr al-Saadi, also known as Abu Munthir, claims he was illegally rendered from Hong Kong to Tripoli with the knowledge of the British Government.

In 2005 Mr Straw told the Commons there was ‘simply no truth’ in claims that the UK was involved in rendition, branding them ‘conspiracy theories’.

Incorrect evidence: The papers claim that Sir John Scarlett, then head of MI6, gave misleading and incorrect evidence to MPs about the agency's involvement

But papers submitted to the High Court 
as part of the case suggest the transfer of the men into Libyan custody 
was part of a deal in which the Libyans agreed to share intelligence 
information.

They also allege that British intelligence officers provided questions and interrogated the men in Libyan custody.

The papers claim that in 2006 Sir John Scarlett, then head of MI6, gave misleading and incorrect evidence to MPs about the agency’s involvement in rendition.

Mr Belhadj and Mr al-Saadi were leading members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which helped overthrow Gaddafi’s regime.

The men’s lawyers at Leigh Day & Co and the legal charity Reprieve warned last night that ‘secret courts’ laws proposed by the Government could lead to a ‘cover-up’ in the case.
