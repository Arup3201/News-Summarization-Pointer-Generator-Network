The Scott Firefighter Combat 'World Challenge XXIII' began in Phoenix, Arizona this week and already, the competitors are feeling the burn.

The annual competition attracts firefighters from across the world - countries such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and France, to name a few - to battle it out in  time-based physical challenges.

As seen on ESPN, the challenge seeks to encourage firefighter fitness and demonstrates the real rigors of the job to the public.  

Firefighters compete against the clock - and each other - completing a series of physically demanding tasks

The Scott Firefighter Combat 'World Challenge XXIII' runs from November 3 to November 8 in Phoenix, Arizona

Challengers complete a five-part obstacle course, with such activities as carrying a life-sized 'victim'

Intense rigours of the course are meant to illustrate firefighter fitness levels and the difficult nature of the job

The video shows both men and women dressed in 'full bunker gear' - and even respirator masks - going head-to-head in a demanding obstacle course.

Competitors performed a series of five tasks including climbing the five-storey tower, hoisting, chopping, dragging hoses, and rescuing and carrying a life-sized 175 lb (79 kg) 'victim.'

Preliminary time trials run until November 7 and the finals will take places on Saturday, November 8.
