It could be Britain’s first billion-pound divorce – if the combatants can agree on their respective wealth.

Financier Sir Chris Hohn is one of Britain’s top philanthropists, having handed more than £1billion to children’s charities.

But his American wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn, claims he is not being as generous when it comes to her settlement.

Sir Chris, 47, says Mrs Cooper-Hohn, 49, is entitled to just 25 per cent of a family fortune.

She is asking for an equal split.

The couple married in 1985 and had four children, including triplets, before she petitioned for divorce in March 2012.

A
 battle has broken out over the value of The Children’s Investment Fund 
(TCI), which he founded, with the Surrey-born billionaire threatening to
 walk away and leave it effectively worthless.

Sir
 Chris puts a value of only £64million on the company’s net assets, 
while his wife claims his shares are worth more than £872million.

Yesterday Mrs Cooper-Hohn lost her bid to produce expert evidence about 
the value of his hedge fund management companies.

Earlier
 this year, a High Court judge said the proposed evidence was 
speculative and of no material value in the consideration of her 
financial claim against Sir Chris.

Mrs Cooper-Hohn’s counsel, Martin 
Pointer QC, told the Court of Appeal it was necessary to have an 
independent assessment of the TCI Group entities for the purpose of 
resolving the financial dispute at a trial due to start on June 30.

Forbes listed Sir Chris as one of the world's highest-earning hedge fund managers and traders last year, estimating his annual earnings at around £225million.

The Surrey-born hedge fund manager set up the Children's Investment Fund (TCI) in 2003 with most of the company's huge profits being channelled to the foundation managed by his wife, who he met at Harvard University.

It is estimated the charity made around £1.2billion out of the arrangement, including around £800million in 2007 and 2008, which made Sir Chris one of Britain's most generous men.

He came to public attention last year when it emerged his investment fund had snapped up five per cent of shares in Royal Mail.

The revelation increased pressure on ministers at the time over whether the firm was undervalued before its sale.

Mr Hohn was once described as a ‘locust’ after helping to remove the boss of Deutsche Börse, a German firm that was trying to buy the London Stock Exchange.

He
 said the judge had erroneously adopted the husband’s valuation, 
accepting without question that the business was wholly dependent upon 
him and he was never going to sell it.

‘The
 notion that the husband is really the only person who matters for the 
purposes of valuing the business is over-stating it,’ Mr Pointer said.

The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) aims to improve the lives of children in developing countries, mainly India and Africa, by achieving.

A statement on the company's website says: 'We believe that every child deserves to survive, thrive and mature into adulthood in a supportive and safe environment'.

The key areas the charity focuses on are neonatal survival, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, education, combating malnutrition, deworming and climate change.

Earlier this month CIFF announced it is investing £14.6million in HPV vaccination, which offers the best protection against cervical cancer for women living in developing countries.

Both Sir Chris Hohn and Mrs Cooper-Hohn are listed as trustees of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation.

He added that it was not credible that Sir Chris would just walk away 
from the business: ‘He has generated wealth of $5.7billion 
(£3.3billion).

'It is not in his character simply to walk away if there 
is significant value in the hedge fund management companies that he 
could realise.’

For Sir Chris, Lewis Marks QC said the judge was entitled to reach the opinion that the evidence was not necessary.

‘The
 evidence before him was that the husband was the sole decision-maker in
 this enterprise, makes all the investment decisions and is the 
regulated person as far as the Financial Services Authority is 
concerned.

'Without him, there is no business.’

Dismissing Mrs 
Cooper-Hohn’s appeal, Lord Justice Ryder said the expert report could be
 only hypothetical and would be neither relevant nor necessary.

The
 court heard that the couple’s assets comprised of investments in TCI of
 £680million, the disputed TCI entities, other investments (£17million),
 pensions (£50million) and properties (£21million).
