It is a Friday night at New Bucks Head in Telford. Roy Hodgson has just watched England Under 20s dismantle Romania 6-0. He makes straight for coach Aidy Boothroyd.

‘Tell me more about the winger, Aarons,’ he demands. Hodgson, though, has already seen enough. He is considering an invite to train with the senior squad, as he is with a number of the young Lions.

For what the England boss has just witnessed, a goal and man-of-the-match display on his international debut, is what many on Tyneside have been whispering about for a while — Rolando Aarons, the boy from Jamaica with a turn of foot like Usain Bolt and all the trickery of John Barnes. 

Rolando Aarons scores after seven minutes to set Newcastle on their way to shock win at Manchester City

The chance to join Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney at St George’s Park, however, never materialises due to a hamstring injury. But his name has been pencilled in. 

That was September. On Wednesday night, as he terrorised a Manchester City backline worth in excess of £40million, pencil turned to ink. It was he, on his return from that injury, who opened the scoring after just seven minutes to set Newcastle on their way to a shock 2-0 victory and in to the last eight of the League Cup.  

On Saturday, the 18-year-old could make his first Premier League start against Liverpool. Residing in the opposition team will be Raheem Sterling, 11 months his senior. Sterling was also born in Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, before moving to the UK at a young age.

Comparison, therefore, is inevitable, not that Aarons invites such parallels.

‘I’m not Raheem Sterling – and Raheem Sterling is not me,’ returns the sure-headed youngster, seemingly determined to forge his own path in the game.  

‘Raheem Sterling has played really well for the last two or three seasons and I’ m nowhere near that level yet. I don’t want people to compare us, although he’s obviously a player that I admire.’

Comparisons? No. How about a shirt swap?

‘Hopefully I’ll get the chance to play in the same game as him, and if that happens I might ask for his shirt. Why not? He’s a good player,’ he says, before guarding against the mistake of Mario Balotelli. ‘Whatever happens, I definitely won’t be swapping at half-time though!’ 

Aarons continues: ‘But I’ve got a long way to go before I can even consider myself to be anywhere like (Sterling). He’s played for England at the World Cup, and I’ve only played three or four games for Newcastle United. I don’t think there’s any reason to get carried away.’ 

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew congratulates Aarons after League Cup success

The fact is, when the England manager is smitten after marvelling at 79 minutes on a non-league pitch at a remote Shropshire outpost, there is reason to get a little bit excited. 

‘I’m aware of people talking, but it doesn’t really bother me,’ he says.

‘I’m just focusing on playing football, and what other people are saying about me, or the praise that I’ve been getting, doesn’t really affect what I’m doing. I know I can play much better than I have been.’

That last statement must sound as a warning for Newcastle’s upcoming opponents, starting with a Liverpool defence terrified of pace and cunning, both of which Aarons boasts.

City discovered that when he sprung clear of their trailing rearguard before slotting through the legs of Willy Caballero. He made way at the break – ‘knackered’, he later explained – but perhaps Alan Pardew was saving Aarons to unleash on the out-of-form Reds. 

For his Newcastle manager, like Hodgson, is rather taken with the teen.

‘He has a nice temperament,’ says Pardew of the player who arrived at the club from Bristol City as a 15-year-old.

‘I think he had some troubles at Bristol City, but I really like him as a person. He has got his feet on the ground, he has got tremendous potential and this could be a breakthrough season for him.’ 

Teenager Aarons has drawn inevitable comparisons with Liverpool's Raheem Sterling

Pardew read an article on MailOnline earlier this week which suggested, according to data, that Everton’s Phil Jagielka is the quickest player in the top flight, prompting him to say: ‘I saw that Jagielka is apparently the quickest in the Premier League.

‘Well, I would bet Rolando and Gabriel Obertan against him any day of the week. His (Aarons) massive asset is his pace.’

Aarons, having already won admirers from the very top of the English game, certainly isn’t hanging about.
