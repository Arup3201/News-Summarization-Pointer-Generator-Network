A young Polar bear has been pictured playing in the ice as he made his first public appearance at a German zoo.

The cub was born at Rostock Zoo in the North East of the country in December and has now been christened Fiete after his keepers received 3,000 name suggestions.

Fiete's father is a male called Lars - the same bear that fathered Knut, a cub that became a global sensation after he was born in captivity in Berlin eight years ago.

Rostock Zoo's four-month-old bear was christened by the city's mayor Roland Methling, who sprayed the young animal with water from a fire hose.

At just four months old the bear is still living with his mother Vilma - and has already been seen exploring his snow-covered enclosure.

The young animal will remain under the care of his mother for the next two years while he gathers strength.
