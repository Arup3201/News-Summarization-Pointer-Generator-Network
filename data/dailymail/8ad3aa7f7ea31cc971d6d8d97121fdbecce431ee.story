Five family members were murdered by a neighbour who set fire to their baby’s pushchair because she was fed up with it being left outside her front door, a court heard yesterday.

It caused a ‘devastating’ inferno which trapped Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their baby son Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers’s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two, in their first-floor flat.

As the fire took hold, Mr Timbrell was heard in the background of a 999 call played to the jury screaming: ‘Oh my God, oh my God, we’re going to die.’

Victims: Skye Allen, aged two years, and Bailey Allen, four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North Wales

Fire deaths: Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze

He and Charlie were brought out alive 
by firefighters.

Despite being badly burned Mr Timbrell managed to tell 
police that, moments earlier, he heard his neighbour Melanie Smith, 43, 
shouting through the letterbox: ‘I’m going to burn your house down.’

Mr Timbrell and Charlie died in 
hospital. Miss Shiers, Bailey and Skye, who were the children of Miss 
Shiers’s brother Steve Allen and were sleeping over for the night, 
perished in a loft bedroom.

Mold Crown Court heard that the fire was 
deliberately started by jobless Smith, a mother of two who lived in a 
flat below.

She had allegedly repeatedly rowed 
with Miss Shiers over Charlie’s pushchair being left in a communal 
hallway, as well as the couple making noise upstairs.

Jealous Smith had also accused Miss 
Shiers of having a sexual relationship with her partner Steven Clarkson,
45, an allegation, said Ian Murphy QC, prosecuting, for which there was
‘no basis at all’.

On one occasion Smith, a heavy drinker, is alleged 
to have told Miss Shiers: ‘I will set your house on fire with you and 
your kids in.’ Seven weeks later, it is alleged, she carried out the 
threat.

The jury was told that Miss Shiers 
habitually kept the pushchair in the downstairs hallway, pushed up 
against the door which gave access to a staircase leading to the 
upstairs flat in a block in Prestatyn, North Wales.

'I will set your house on fire with you and your kids in'

What Melanie Smith allegedly told neighbour Lee-Anna Shiers

Mr Murphy said that on October 19 last
year ‘this pushchair and items left on top of it were deliberately 
ignited with a naked flame... and a devastating fire developed rushing 
up the stairs to the flat above and killing all of those inside’.

In the months leading up to the 
tragedy, it is alleged, Smith made repeated threats of arson, beginning 
in August last year when she threatened to burn down the house of 
another local woman, Samantha Schofield, who she also believed was 
having an affair with Mr Clarkson.

Then, on September 1 last year, Smith
got into a drunken argument with Miss Shiers, saying: ‘I am going to 
set your house on fire with you and your kids in it.’

She was later overheard accusing Mr 
Clarkson of sleeping with Miss Shiers, adding: ‘I will burn the house 
down with her and the kids in it.’

Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year

On the day of the fire Smith told a 
friend she was going to ‘torch or bomb’ her flat so the landlord 
wouldn’t get any money for rent.

Mr Murphy said that Smith also repeated
three times that she was going to ‘kill,’ although she was not specific
about who or when.

On the same day Smith also admitted to
her hairdresser that she didn’t like her neighbours and hoped ‘they’d 
burn to the ground’ because then the council would have to find her a 
new home.

Later, she was visited by her landlord
and began ‘ranting aggressively’ about Miss Shiers, calling her a 
‘scruffy, dirty bitch’. Smith then went out drinking before returning 
home shortly before 9pm.

Fifty minutes later a neighbour, Joe Shelley, spotted flames inside the porch of the flats and made the 999 call.

Smith, of Prestatyn, denies five 
counts of murder and one count of making a threat to destroy or damage 
property. The trial continues.
