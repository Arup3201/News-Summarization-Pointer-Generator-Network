Health managers have backed down over a controversial policy of using a cheap unlicensed drug to treat eye disease

Health managers have backed down over a controversial policy of using a cheap unlicensed drug to treat eye disease.

Trusts have been telling consultants to switch to the cancer drug Avastin rather than Lucentis, which is 15 times more expensive.

Both drugs treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disorder that can lead to blindness, but only Lucentis is licensed and approved for NHS use.

Its manufacturer Novartis has mounted
a legal challenge by seeking judicial review of the policy being 
pursued by a group of primary care trusts in the South of England.

It said widespread use of an unlicensed medicine undermined the system to protect patients.

Charities and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists were also concerned about possible health risks.

Now, the trusts have reversed their 
policy at a board meeting, claiming the price of Lucentis has been cut, 
making it a better deal.

The reluctance of local eye specialists to use the cheaper alternative also meant the policy was not  making planned savings.

The list price for Lucentis is around £900 per injection while the estimated cost of a shot of Avastin is £60.

Bosses at the Southampton, Hampshire,
Isle of Wight and Portsmouth Primary Care Trust Cluster have not 
disclosed how much they had hoped to save.

However, the trusts said switching drugs would have cut the £7.5million annual bill for treating wet AMD.

Professor Jonathan Montgomery, chairman of the PCT Cluster Board, said it continued to believe the  policy was lawful, sensible and safe.

But ‘significant discounts’ in the price of Lucentis are in the best interests of patients, he said.

The professor added: ‘The board also took into account the policy had not been taken up in any meaningful way by consultant ophthalmologists on the advice of their Royal College.

‘This has meant the potential benefits we envisaged, to patients and the NHS, of offering Avastin as well as Lucentis, had not been realised.’

This decision could set a precedent for other NHS trusts planning to recommend Avastin to cut costs, including NHS North Yorkshire and York.

A Daily Mail investigation last year found dozens of PCTs in England have told consultants to switch to Avastin, or leave the decision up to patients.

Although trial data suggests the two drugs are equally effective in treating AMD, Avastin has not been licensed for this purpose and is being used ‘off-label’ which puts responsibility on the doctor to vouch for its safety.

Fears over side effects in the US led to the Department of Veterans Affairs stopping the use of Avastin after reports of infections apparently caused by contaminated syringes.

Patients have lost their remaining sight and one man is suing for £2.6million in damages for loss of sight and brain damage as a result of an infection.

Some doctors attribute a high rate of infections from Avastin to contamination by careless pharmacists splitting vials intended for cancer patients into small doses for eye treatment, but there is also concern the drug stays in the body far longer than Lucentis.

Stephen Whitehead,chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said Novartis had taken ‘the right course of action’.

He said ‘We are pleased that SHIP has decided to revoke its commissioning policy that had supported the use of a medicine which was unlicensed for the indication, in place of a licensed medicine which had already gained full regulatory approval.

‘It continues to be our view that off-label and unlicensed prescribing should be strictly limited to those circumstances where there is no licensed alternative and where the clinician, in discussion with the patient, decides that this is in their best interests.

‘Loosening the regulations in this area would not only put a patient’s safety at risk, it would also undermine the entire regulatory process which is in place to protect public health.’
