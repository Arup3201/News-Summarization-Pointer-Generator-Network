A 36st chef who was bombarded with mocking texts about his size from a well-meaning friend has lost a massive 21st in a year - and finally found love.

Jamie Brooks, 31, piled on the pounds from the age of 14, when he started a part-time job in a kitchen and began picking at food all day.

His weight rapidly spiralled out of control and by his twenties he had ballooned to nearly 36st.

Jamie's weight dropped from 35st 10lb (left) to 14st 4lb (right), and his waist size halved from 60in to 32in after being convinced to go on a diet by his best friend, who bombarded him with harsh, yet inspirational texts like 'You'll be dead by the time you're 40.'

The head chef would cook food all day for pub customers and then gorge on fast food for his own meals because he couldn't face going back into the kitchen at home.

To keep up his energy at work, Jamie guzzled sugary drinks from the bar and ate jumbo-sized packs of Galaxy minstrels in one sitting. 

He had to buy his giant size 7XL tops from a specialist supplier and became resigned to the fact that he would never find love.

But with the help of some very harsh words from a well-meaning friend, Jamie started to turn his life around.

Jamie's good friend Neil Williamson, 46, started to send him texts labelling him a 'fat f**k' every day for six weeks, which ended with finally deciding to go on a diet.

In just 12 months, his weight dropped by almost two thirds, from 35st 10lbs to 14st 4lbs, and his waist size halved from 60in to 32in.

Around the same time he started the diet in January 2014, he became friendly Melanie Mulley, his neighbour in Crowcombe, Somerset.

Jamie - who admits he was 'terrible' with girls - would go to her house during breaks from work at the Carew Arms in Crowcombe to have his diet milkshake.

Confidence issues meant he never found the courage to tell her how he felt until New Year's Eve four weeks ago, after he had completed his astonishing weight loss.

But unfortunately for Jamie, it looked like he had left it too late - Melanie, 36, was preparing to move back to West Wickham, Cambs, where she comes from. 

For a week and a half, she and Jamie had a week of uncertainty about their future - by January 11, she had already packed up her removal van and sent it off on the 200-mile journey to Cambridgeshire.

It took his well-intentioned friend's constant reminder of the reality of his size (left, before he lost weight) to spur Jamie into starting his diet (right, pictured after his weight loss holding a pair of his old trousers) 

But as she was about to follow it, she suddenly decided she couldn't be apart from Jamie and instead moved in with him on the spot - exactly a year to the day after he started his diet.

Jamie said: 'It was a confidence issue on my behalf. I had no luck with girls and didn't think she'd like me but my confidence changed when I lost weight.

'I don't know if she would have wanted to be with me when I was fatter but being more secure in myself definitely made me more attractive as a person.'

Melanie, who has a three year-old daughter, said: 'His confidence grew as he lost weight and I was really proud of what he'd achieved.

'On New Year's Eve he told me I was beautiful inside and out.

'I really realised how much he meant to me when I was moving.

'We'd loaded the van up that morning and I was sitting in the house, getting the last bits ready to go.

'I just said to my friends, "I don't think I can go" and I said, "I've got to go and tell Jamie."

'I legged it over to the pub and that's when I said "I can't leave."'

Most gratifying of all, Jamie has now found love with friend Melanie 

Jamie started the Ideal Weight diet on January 11 last year after his friend Neil, a camper van salesman, saw an advert for it in his local GP surgery.

He was also spurred on by the texts from Neil which told him: 'You'll be dead by the time you're 40'.

Proud Jamie, who used to feel exhausted and lethargic but is now a bundle of energy, says he feels like a 'new man'.

He added: 'I just got bigger and bigger as a child, I was never slim.

'I would combat the embarrassment by laughing it off and I'd just be the fat jolly one of the group.

'It took the full six weeks to motivate me to do something but I'm so glad I did. Neil has saved my life, I can't thank him enough.

'I never made plans for the future as I always thought I would be dead at a young age, but now I'm healthy and have an amazing girlfriend - I'm a new man.'

The one thing Jamie is frustrated by though, is that he has been rejected by the NHS to have excess skin removal surgery.

He said: 'I've done the hard work off my own back and the surgery would be a lot cheaper than an gastric band.

'I see people with boob jobs on the NHS and I think it's unfair that I've been rejected. 

'However I do understand there are people more in need and I'm just glad I'm healthy.'

The Ideal Weight diet took him down to just 640 calories a day with his regular meals replaced with milkshakes, soups and bars.

Jamie says the diet allowed his brain to 'switch off' from thinking about food.

His one normal meal of the day now consists of a low-fat meat from a specialist local butcher with fresh green salads and vegetables.
