Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it would be 'bizarre' to put Scottish pensions at risk

Gordon Brown has warned Scots that their country may not be able to afford the state pension if it opts  for independence.

The former Prime Minister said a Yes vote for independence would mean the loss of the ‘pooling and sharing’ of resources which help pay for retired people’s benefits.

Mr Brown said he did not believe Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s assertions that pensions would continue to be paid, pointing to questions over the value of North Sea oil revenues in the coming years.

Speaking in Lochgelly, Fife – at the launch of a campaign group, Keep our British Pensions – Mr Brown said: ‘We know when we look at the figures for pensions, we in Scotland get a higher share of the UK pension money.’

The Kirkcaldy MP added that when benefits such as pensioners’ credit, the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences are added to the state pension, Scots receive around £200 more on average a year than their English counterparts, amounting to £200million for north of the border.

Mr Brown said: ‘Why does that  happen? It happens because we pool all of our resources as part of the United Kingdom. We have more needs [in Scotland] and more pensioners, therefore we get more.’

Mr Salmond’s Scottish National Party described Mr Brown’s comments as scaremongering.

Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, announced yesterday that Whitehall is granting the Scottish government the power to issue its own bonds.

This will broaden the sources of financing available to the Scottish government for capital investment.

Mr Alexander said this demonstrates ‘once again how Scotland can grow and prosper within the UK’.

Mr Brown said last night: ‘The SNP cannot deny we face a higher bill in an independent Scotland when we lose the pooling and sharing that happens across the UK.’

The SNP has pledged to continue paying the basic state pension at the current rate if there is a Yes vote in September.

Ministers would keep the ‘triple-lock’ guarantee to ensure pensions keep pace with earnings and rising costs for at least the first term of an independent parliament

Scots go to the polls to decide the country's future in the UK in September, with the Scottish Government having already suggested independence could mean a reduction in the state pension age north of the border.

Mr Brown added: ‘We have polling 
evidence that only 15 per cent of pensioners favour independence and 
indeed 61 per cent of all Scottish people believe that pensioners north 
of the border should be paid from UK and not Scottish taxes.

‘We
 must keep the common UK National Insurance fund that we have 
contributed to and paid into all of our working lives. We have accrued 
rights to our pension from successive UK governments.

‘These have to be honoured and continue to be honoured by the UK.

‘It
 is bizarre that we would put Scottish pensions at risk at a time when 
pension spending in Scotland is rising faster than in the rest of the 
UK.’

He continued: ‘The 
number of over 60s in Scotland will grow from the current 22per cent of 
the population to 32per cent by the year 2035.’

An expert commission would be established to consider the appropriate age threshold for pensions, with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon having already suggested this could see people in Scotland picking up their state pension earlier than those in the rest of the UK.

Mr McClymont said: ‘One fact is 
indisputable. The costs of meeting the needs of Scottish pensioners will
 be higher in years to come. There is absolutely no doubt we are better 
off spreading the risks as part of the Union.’

Mr Salmond's Scottish National Party described Mr Brown's comments as scaremongering

A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ‘The National Institute of Economic Social Research report published last week shows that individual pensions in Scotland would be 6per cent to 8per cent cheaper compared to the rest of the UK.

‘Scotland is better able to afford pension and welfare payments than the rest of the UK. Social protection takes up a smaller share of our national output and our tax revenues than it does in the UK as a whole.

‘The research also makes clear that the lower life expectancy in Scotland means it would be fairer for people here if the increase in the pension age was postponed. Indeed, the paper states that the optimal policy for Scotland would be a state pension age relatively lower than the rest of the UK.

‘In the first year of an independent Scotland, we will establish an independent commission to consider the appropriate pace of further change to the retirement age beyond 66, taking account of Scottish circumstances.

‘The commission would report to the Scottish Parliament within the first two years of independence, allowing us to take decisions which best suit the needs of people in Scotland nearing pensionable age.’
