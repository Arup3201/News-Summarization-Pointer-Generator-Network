A man who ran up a $28,000 bar tab during a drunken night out has been told he will have to pay up despite his attempts to sue the bar that served him.

William Ilg claimed that the Hustler Club in Manhattan should not have given him the drinks because he was 'no longer capable of conducting financial transactions'.

However, the New Yorker's case was thrown out by a judge and adding to what must have already been a terrible hangover, he will now have to pay the credit card bill of $28,109.60.

Failed: Mr Ilg filed a lawsuit against Hustler Club in New York, pictured, claiming he was so drunk bar staff should not have served him - but a judge dismissed the case

He filed a lawsuit against the adult chain claiming the Hustler Club had refused to return the money to him, reported the New York Daily News.

He stated the club had committed 'a fraud and wrongful conversion' because they wouldn't give him a refund.

Mr Ilg’s lawyer Paul Kerson said in the lawsuit that he was also looking for punitive damages after 'outrageous' conduct by the club.

But Manhattan Supreme Court Justice 
Manuel Mendez dismissed the case saying: 'There is no duty upon (Hustler
 Club) to protect the plaintiff from the results of his (voluntary) 
intoxication.'

The judge also threw out another legal action Ilg filed this year claiming the club lacked the proper liquor license.  The
 lawsuit follows a separate case filed against the same club last year 
by a Delaware man, who also said he was also falsely billed a huge 
amount.

Gerard Wall claimed
 to have been charged more than $21,000 on two credit cards even though 
he only wanted a $300 topless lap-dance.

He said he had a huge gap in his memory and woke up the next day in Delaware after being driven home by a club employee. The lawsuit was settled last year.
