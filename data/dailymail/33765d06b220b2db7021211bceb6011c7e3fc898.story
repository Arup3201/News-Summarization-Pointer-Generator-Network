The BBC has revealed a record number of viewers now watch its programmes on the internet, fuelling fears thousands of households are legally dodging the licence fee.

New figures show the corporation’s iPlayer website received 242million hits last month, up 38 per cent on last year.

More than two million watched Top Gear online, while many others used the internet to stream sporting events, such as the Wimbledon tennis final.

It is thought many viewers who use the iPlayer service do not own televisions, meaning they are not required to pay the £145.50 annual licence fee.

A TV licence is required for viewing programmes online only when they are broadcast in their scheduled slots or streamed live, as in the case of Wimbledon.

Although the BBC has so far refused calls to reveal how many households dodge the fee by using this online loophole, the statistics suggest the corporation’s funding model has become increasingly outmoded in the digital age.

Almost all the BBC’s programmes are available on the internet catch-up service and can be viewed just a few minutes after finishing on television. Some programmes, such as a forthcoming Peter Kay sitcom, are even being made available on iPlayer first.

The idea is likely to be extended 
after the BBC approved a 12-month trial which would allow up to 40 hours
 of programming to be shown online before transmission on TV.

It means licence fee payers without internet access are funding programmes they cannot watch.The figures were released as Hollywood 
actor Kevin Spacey predicted that traditional TV channels will be killed
 off in the next ten to 20 years as viewers turn to the internet to 
watch their favourite shows.

He said viewers of the future will choose
 to ‘binge’ for days on end as entire series are made available online, 
rather than commit to weeks of viewing as each episode is broadcast on 
TV.

Spacey, 54, said the success of his online-only series House of Cards was proof of the shift in viewing habits.

He starred in and produced the political drama, which has been watched by more than 1.5million Britons this year via online distributor Netflix.

Giving the annual MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh Television Festival last night, Spacey said viewers now want the freedom to watch what they want, whenever they want.

‘Clearly the success of the Netflix model – releasing the entire season  of House of Cards at once – has  proved one thing: The audience wants the control. They want freedom,’  he said.

‘If they want to binge – as they’ve been doing on House of Cards – then we should let them binge. Many people have stopped me on the street to say, “Thanks, you sucked three days out of my life”.’

The Oscar winner, who has starred in a string of successful films, became the artistic director of London’s Old Vic theatre in 2003.

But instead of defending traditional mediums, he said film and TV would be completely replaced by online shows ‘in the next decade or two’.

He said: ‘For kids growing up now there’s no difference watching Avatar on an iPad or watching YouTube on a TV and watching Game of Thrones on their computer. It’s all content. It’s all story.’

He added: ‘We all still crave shared experiences. But these days the water cooler moment where people gathered at work to talk about what they’d seen on TV the night before, has vanished. We no longer live in a world of appointment viewing.’
