Pinching his cheeks, feeding him doughnuts, wiping morsels of jam off his cheeky chops - Keisuki Jinushi looks to all his Instagram followers as if he's in the perfect relationship.

Except that Jinushi doesn't actually have a girlfriend.

And the hand stroking the young Japanese man's face is his own.

All
 you need to turn your hand into a lover's is some thick foundation, nail polish and a girly 
hair-tie to wear around your wrist.

effect.
