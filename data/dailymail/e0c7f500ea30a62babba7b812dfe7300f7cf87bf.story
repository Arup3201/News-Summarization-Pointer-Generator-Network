Radio DJ Sara Cox shortly after giving birth to her daughter Lola, right, now 9, who she refuses to let watch Come Dine With Me as it's too raunchy

Former Radio 1 ladette Sara Cox has blasted modern media for being too crude, branding Channel 4 programme Come Dine With Me 'raunchy' and rap music 'sexist.'

The 39-year-old mother of three, known for her days of hard partying in the 1990s has criticised US rapper Pitbull saying his sexist lyrics 'make her soul weep.'

She said: 'Someone like [rapper] Pitbull on Radio 1
 makes my soul weep with the way he sings about women - I just couldn't 
bear playing that.'

She then turned on Radio 1 for playing tracks that feature 'sexist' 
lyrics which are rife in hip hop music and modern pop music.

Pitbull, whose real name is Armando Perez burst onto the music scene in
 2009 with the hit song 'I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)' from his 
fourth album Rebelution. He has sold over five million albums, with 
number one hits in more than 15 countries.

The artist has had an extraordinary amount of commercial success but often comes under fire for his depiction of women in his videos and  songs.

The Latin artist's lyrics and videos often ooze with references to scantily clad women and sex.

His
 lyrics in his song 'Timber', which reached number one last year, 
include: 'I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off/twerking in their 
bras and thongs… face down, booty up.'

Her criticism of Pitbull comes on the 
heels of growing concern over the explicit sexual content in pop music and the use of half-naked women in videos
 like Robin Thicke's hit Blurred lines.

However a BBC spokesman told Mail Online: 'Each track is considered for the playlist based on its musical merit and whether it is right for our young audience, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis.’

He added that there are currently no Pitbull songs on the Radio 1 playlist.

Back in the day: Sara Cox pictured when she was a TV presenter on Channel 4 show 'Born Sloppy'

The ultimate ladette 'Sara Cox' was born in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

The lively outspoken broadcaster has never steered away from controversy and once said live on air in 2000 that the Queen Mother 'smelt of wee'.

She is probably best known for presenting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show between 2000 and 2003. She now hosts 'Sounds of the 80s' on BBC Radio 2.

However, she was also well known for presenting Top of the Pops, The Girlie Show on Channel 4,  Born Sloppy and The Big Breakfast, following in the footsteps of her friend Zoë Ball.

She was known as being a poster child for the  1990s ladette culture along with Ball.

Cox transferred to radio in 1999 when she joined Radio 1.

In 2001, she married DJ Jon Carter; they split in December 2005. Last year, Cox tweeted a picture to announce she had just been married to long-term boyfriend, Ben Cyzer. She has three children.

In the early 1990s Cox, was a presenter on Channel 4's edgy
 The Girlie Show and was frequently pictured out clubbing 
with a glass of drink in her hand.

Bolton-born Cox, now based in Willesden, north London, previously faced criticism for her involvement in ladette culture.

But her life is very different today.

She admits in an interview with the Radio Times: 'I used to watch Come Dine With Me with my daughter, Lola, who's nine.

But
 she says she can't anymore because they've always got 'strippers on' or
 someone with their cleavage out, adding 'it's a shame because it used 
to have a real innocence to it.'

Cox made her name on her brash and sometimes offensive 
behaviour.

She controversially said that the Queen Mother 'smelt of wee' on air but said she had settled down by the time she began to host the 
Radio 1 breakfast show during the late nineties. 

However, despite her party girl image, she explained that she never used to pretend that she was 'the youth' when she was at Radio 1.

'People knew that I'd gone to bed at 9.30 the night before, having prepared a casserole,' she said.

The retired wild child also admitted that she still dreamt of acting and wanted to write.

She
 added: 'I wouldn't mind if Martin Freeman was to demand me in his next 
project, but actually I need to get round to some writing. When you're 
doing the school run and walking the dog it's pretty tricky to find time
 to become a world famous writer and Oscar-winning actress.'

Pitbull, whose real name is Armando Perez, is an American rapper and Latin Grammy winning artist from Miami, Florida.

He has released seven albums and one EP. He burst onto the music scene in 2009 with the hit song 'I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)” from his fourth album Rebelution.

The artist has sold well over five million albums, with number one hits in more than 15 countries.

But his songs, as well as the accompanying music videos, often prompt controversy.

Pitbull’s song 'Timber', which reached number one last year, includes the lyrics: 'I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off/twerking in their bras and thongs… face down, booty up.'

He also sings: 'She say she won’t, but I bet she will.' Other songs include the lines 'I like that when you fight back' and 'Shake that s*** b****/And be off in the club with a hard-a** d***.'In his song Give Me Everything, he raps 'Tonight I want all of you tonight, Give me everything tonight. For all we know we might not get tomorrow Let's do it tonight.'

His video for the song 'I’m a Freak 'with Enrique Iglesias has also been criticised for its objectification of women.

The popular rapper can often be seen hitting the stage with fellow Latin artist Jennifer Lopez.
