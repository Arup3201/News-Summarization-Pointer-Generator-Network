Banks across America appear to be fighting the growing protest against income disparity and rising fees as the Occupy Wall Street movement spreads worldwide.

A series of videos filmed across the U.S. in New York City; Santa Cruz, California and St Louis, Missouri, show customers staging protests and mass account closures.

However, footage has emerged showing what 
appears to be dozens of Citibank and Bank of America customers denied 
requests to close their accounts, some even being arrested after alleged
 clashes with branch managers.

Arrested: Video footage shows a woman being detained outside of a Citibank branch in Manhattan after she attempts to enter with her chequebook in hand

After a weekend of demonstrations spreading around the world, Occupy Wall Street is today celebrating the one-month anniversary of when its movement began.

President Obama wants to tap into public anger to turn up the heat on congressional Republicans as he embarks on a bus tour to rally support for his $447 billion jobs plan.

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin defended plans to bolster social spending and said it would help stave off any similar protests there.

In Britain hundreds of anti-capitalist protesters mingled with bemused bank workers outside St. Paul's Cathedral in London on Monday.

Back in New York protesters are planning more events, including a 'National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality' on Saturday.

Celebrities are continuing to endorse the protest. Martin Luther King Jr's son said that his father would have joined the demonstration.

Protesters continue to camp out in Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, but temperatures will fall to 50F (10C) this week, which could drive some away.

Video footage obtained by Gawker.com 
earlier this month shows dozens of people corralled inside of a Citibank 
branch in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, some signalling inside they are
 facing arrest.

A woman dressed in a business suit 
holding a checkbook attempts to enter but is stopped by officers outside
 who ask her if she was part of the protest.

After 
calmly insisting she is a customer of the bank, a plain-clothed officer 
detains her.

Police swarm as she appears to be taken back inside - one 
of 24 people arrested on charges of criminal trespassing, reports the 
website.

Citibank said in an official statement the group was 'very disruptive and refused to leave after being repeatedly asked'.

A bank spokesman said one person 
asked to close an account and was accommodated and acknowledged that the
 branch was closed 'until the protesters could be removed'.

The footage follows a video uploaded 
to YouTube on October 8, which shows three Occupy Santa Cruz protesters 
attempting to close their accounts at a local Bank of America branch.

Two of the women are shown walking into the branch and sitting down, one of them with a large placard.

A manager asks the women to leave and
 threatens to call police, claiming 'you cannot be a protester and a 
customer at the same time'.

The women leave and vow to return without a sign the following day to close their accounts.

The scenes were reminiscent of a 
rally in St Louis on August 12, which saw several people lining up 
outside of a Bank of America branch in effort to close their accounts.

Video footage uploaded on YouTube shows demonstrators shouting on bullhorns outside of the 
branch in protest, as Bank of America employees stand outside barring the 
group from entering.

The spectacles come weeks after both Citibank and Bank of America unveiled plans to hike fees for its services.

Earlier this month, Citibank 
announced changes to its mid-tier checking accounts, which offer the 
potential for earning interest and a few other perks.

Starting in 
December, Citi will charge $20 a month on these accounts, unless the 
customer has combined balances of $15,000 or more in checking, savings 
and investment accounts or loan balances.

The fee was previously waived for 
combined balances of $6,000 for that level of account, which offers 
perks such as interest-bearing checking.

Customers also pay $2 fees for using non-Citi ATMs if they don't meet the balance requirement. Last month Citi said it will no 
longer give rewards points for debit card transactions.

That stemmed, in
 part, from changes in federal regulations that cut roughly in half the 
amount banks could charge retailers for processing purchases made on 
debit cards, a rule that's cutting sharply into bank revenue.

Citi's move came just a few days 
after Bank of America Corp said it would be charging $5 per month for 
using debit cards starting next year.

Weekend action: Occupy Wall Street protesters shout slogans against banks and economic system while they take part in a protest at Times Square in New York on Saturday

Other banks have also been testing
 such fees.

U.S. cities large and small were 
'occupied' over the weekend by the group that calls themselves 'the 99 
per cent': Washington, D.C., Fairbanks, Alaska, Burlington, Vermont, 
Rapid City, South Dakot, and Cheyenne, Wyoming were just a few.

More than 70 New York protesters were
 arrested Saturday, more than 40 of them in Times Square.

About 175 
people were arrested in Chicago after they refused to leave a park where
 they were camped late Saturday, and there were about 100 arrests in 
Arizona - 53 in Tucson and 46 in Phoenix - after protesters refused 
police orders to disperse.

About two dozen people were arrested in 
Denver, and in Sacramento, California.

Meanwhile,
 an offshoot movement called Bank Transfer Day appears to be gaining 
momentum.

A statement on the movement's Facebook page encourages 
supporters to take a stand against big banks by removing their funds on 
November 5th.

'Together
 we can ensure that these banking institutions will always remember the 
5th of November!!

'If the 99% removes our funds from the major banking 
institutions on or by this date, we will send a clear message and give 
the 1% a taste of the fear that we experience every day when we aren't 
able to pay for our rent, food, medication, utilities, student loans, 
etc.,' it reads.
