Newspapers were on collision course 
with the three party leaders last night as industry backing for their 
royal charter for new rules governing the 300-year-old free Press 
crumbled.

Fraser Nelson, editor of the 
Spectator, the oldest continuously published magazine in the English 
language, would not recognise the proposed regulator, irrespective of 
the consequences.

He published a dramatic front page with the single word ‘No’.

Lionel Barber, editor of the 
Financial Times, a newspaper that had been supportive of the charter, 
expressed concerns it would lead to ‘vexatious complaints’ and ‘tie us 
in knots’.

The Newspaper Society warned the plans
could place ‘a crippling burden on the UK’s 1,100 local newspapers, 
inhibiting freedom of speech and the freedom to publish’.

Its president Adrian Jeakings said: ‘A
free Press cannot be free if it is dependent on and accountable to a 
regulatory body recognised by the state.’

The cross-party agreement struck in 
late night three-party talks was also attacked yesterday by the 
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the international 
body that polices human rights.

And, in a particularly humiliating 
blow, the Kremlin-funded broadcaster Russia Today described the 
guidelines as a ‘threat to Press freedom’.

Opposed: Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, which is not part of the existing watchdog system, suggested he had no intention of joining the new regulator

Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, 
which is not part of the existing watchdog system, suggested he had no 
intention of joining the new regulator: ‘You can’t really say this is a 
considered and thoughtful process when, in the middle of the night, bits
are added to two different bills.’

Rupert Murdoch, whose companies own 
The Times, the Sunday Times and The Sun, suggested even the Queen would 
not approve the royal charter. ‘UK royal charter requires Queen’s 
signature. Unlikely without full all party support. Queen doesn’t do 
politics,’ he wrote on Twitter.

Mr Barber told the BBC the FT had not
yet determined whether to join the regulatory body. But he added: ‘This
has not been a  satisfactory process.

'We will be looking at the practical implications and, above all, what has  been completely lost in this process, the cost.

‘I am worried about the practical 
costs of, for example, allowing free access to arbitration, I am worried
about claims-farming, vexatious complaints from readers and others who 
will tie us up in knots. This is a real problem.’

But Max Mosley, one of the leading 
campaigners for new controls insisted yesterday that if newspapers 
refused to sign up then Parliament should ‘intervene’ – raising the 
prospect of a full-blown Press law.

The former Formula 1 boss, who became a
privacy campaigner after winning a court case against the News of the 
World for publishing pictures of him at an orgy with prostitutes, told 
MPs he believed all publishers would eventually submit to the new 
regulator.

He told MPs on the Commons culture, 
media and sport select committee, newspaper proprietors will put aside 
‘emotional’ concerns about statutory regulation and be persuaded by 
financial incentives.

Newspapers that decline to participate
in the regulator, which will have the power to dictate the nature and 
prominence of corrections and issue £1million fines, are being 
threatened with ‘exemplary’ damages in libel or privacy cases.

Editor-in-chief of Guardian News and Media Alan Rusbridger retained ¿grave reservations¿ about the proposed legislation on exemplary damages

Mr Mosley sparked anger when he went 
on to suggest that websites based overseas that ignore the instructions 
of the new regulator could be shut down.

But Tory backbencher Mark Reckless said that he hoped that the press would not co-operate with the regulator.

He referred to the way the unions in the 1970s refused to recognise the Heath Government's industrial relations court.

Kirsty Hughes, spokesman for Campaign 
group Index on Censorship, said: ‘Closing down websites is the kind of 
behaviour expected of totalitarian regimes like Iran and China, not the 
UK.’

Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of 
Guardian News & Media, said: ‘We welcome the fact there has been 
cross-party agreement. The regulatory settlement is by and large a fair 
one, with compromises on all sides.’

But he said he retained ‘grave reservations’ about the proposed legislation on exemplary damages.

Amid confusion about which websites 
would be covered by the new system, a spokesman for the Department for 
Culture, Media and Sport said: ‘Bloggers are covered by the 
self-regulatory model if they are the relevant publisher with multiple 
authors writing in the course of their business.’

The Association of Online Publishers 
issued a statement to say it had ‘major concerns’, particularly over the
threat of punitive awards in the libel courts for those who do not join
the regulatory system.

Camilla Wright, who founded the 
entertainment website Popbitch, said she would move it to America to 
avoid being subject to a regulator with power over websites that produce
celebrity gossip.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles illustrated the low opinion of the celebrity wing of the Hacked Off pressure group among cabinet circles when he described Hugh Grant as 'the leader of the opposition Lord Grant of Rodeo Drive.'
