The landscape for dating has changed a little since the days of Shakespeare with many of us turning to match-making websites and apps such as Tinder in hope of finding true love.

However, one young singleton was determined to bring a bit of old-fashioned romance back to online dating.

Lifestyle website The Debrief set one of its writers, Sophie Cullinane, the hilarious task of using some of history's greatest love letters as the script for Tinder conversations with potential new dates.

Love online: Many of us now use dating websites and apps such as Tinder while looking for a relationship

Some of the letters used as the basis for conversation included those to Barbara from George Bush during World War two and entries in Frida Kahlo's diary dedicated to her lover Diego Rivera.

Once Sophie had her conversations (mainly ending in being blocked) she then rated her potential suitors out of ten and gave the lessons that she learnt from each man. 

The results range from the completely outraged to the surprisingly charming and for some guys the clincher still remains on what football team you support.  

George H. Bush to Barbara Bush, 1943

George H. Bush wrote this in a touching letter to a Barbara Pierce of Rye, New York while he was away during World War II. 

It is one of the many love letters George wrote to his future wife to have survived because she kept it in her engagement scrapbook – the others were lost in one of their many later moves. That's the problem with love letters – there's no backing-up system.

Straight to the point: Sophie appeared to scare off her prospective date when she discussed having children so early on in their conversation

ORIGINAL LETTER: 

'This should be a very easy letter to write — words should come easily and in short it should be simple for me to tell you how desperately happy I was to open the paper and see the announcement of our engagement, but somehow I can't possibly say all in a letter I should like to. I love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life. How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day. How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you...'

TINDER CONVERSATION 

James: Hi Sophie :-)

Sophie: How lucky our children will be to have a father like you

J: Haha indeed

S: How often I have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day

J: Ok…

Where based?

You*

S: Milton, Massachusetts

J: That's quite far away lol I'm in London

S: I love you, precious, with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life

Hopeless romantic. George Bush would write to his wife Barbara while he was away during World War two

J: Great

You sure you're not a bot

S: Fairly

J: When you coming to meet me then?

S: I can't possibly say all I should like to

J: What team do you support?

S: Arsenal. You?

J: Spurs

Lessons: It looks like Tinder is responsive to romance Bush-style (lol), but is definitely not OK with you supporting the wrong football team.

Oscar Wilde To Lord Alfred Douglas, 1897

Love letters between Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas were eventually read out in the court case that saw Wilde serve two years for indecency and sodomy. 

This letter to his lover of six years was written just after Wilde was released from prison and had fled to France. Douglas, who was known as 'Bosie' to his friends, had a tempestuous relationship and would often argue and break up, but would always reconcile.

Deep conversation: The confused Tinder user tries to decipher the Oscar Wilde quotes used in this exchange

ORIGINAL LETTER 

'Everyone is furious with me for going back to you, but they don't understand us. I feel that it is only with you that I can do anything at all. Do remake my ruined life for me, and then our friendship and love will have a different meaning to the world. I wish that when we met at Rouen we had not parted at all. There are such wide abysses now of space and land between us. But we love each other.'

TINDER CONVERSATION 

Mike: How are you?

S: Do remake my ruined life for me

M: Would love to

What's happened?

S: There are such wide abysses now of space and land between us

M: How long have you been single?

Old fashioned love: Oscar Wilde with his lover Lord Alfred Douglas who he used to write to, his letters were eventually used against him in court that saw him spend two years in prison for indecency 

S: I feel like it is only with you that I can do anything at all

M: What would you like to do?

S: Meet at Rouen?

M: Where's Rouen?

S: In North-Western France on the River Seine

M: Lovely

Rating: 10/10

Lessons: We'll get back to you on that one once we're back from Rouen

Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, 1940s

This is only one of numerous love letters Frida Kahlo addressed to Diego Rivera in the diary she kept during the 1940s. It speaks of the deep and abiding bond the couple had despite several infidelities (on both sides) and a brief divorce.

Confused: This potential Tinder date seems utterly baffled by the topic of conversation

ORIGINAL LETTER 

'Nothing compares to your hands, nothing like the green-gold of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. You are the mirror of the night. The violent flash of lightning. The dampness of the earth. The hollow of your armpits is my shelter. My fingers touch your blood. All my joy is to feel life spring from your flower-fountain that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours.'

TINDER CONVERSATION 

Neil: Hey you (smiley face)

S: You are the mirror of the night. The violent flash of lightning. The dampness of the earth.

N: Huh?!

(embarrassed face)

Secret love: Frida Kahlo wrote her letters to Diego Rivera in the diary she kept during the 1940s

S: The hollow of your armpit is my shelter

N: hahahahahahahahaha

Wtf are you on?

S: My fingers touch your blood

Lessons: No matter how intense and painterly you'd like your romance to become, probably best not to mention either blood or armpits within the first ten minutes of meeting someone on Tinder. Useful.
