One of the racecars on a dangerous mountain course flew off a turn an proceeded to flip over at least a dozen times down the side of a Colorado hill.

The crash was captured on video and remarkably the driver and passenger are both fine, but the same cannot be said for their car.

The car was ripped to shreds as it crashed in during the Pikes Peak International hill Climb in Fountain, Colorado on Sunday.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The moment they lost control: Driver Jeremy Foley and co-driver Yuri Kouznetsov were going predictably fast around a curve on mile 16 of the course and went off the side of the road

The first of many: The 19-second video of the crash shows that the car flips about 12 times

Loosing its structure: The car looses more and more parts as it rolls down the Colorado hill

Driver Jeremy Foley- who was participating in his first race at the well-known course- and his co-driver Yuri Kouznetsov were going predictably fast around a curve on mile 16 of the course and went off the side of the road.

Video of the crash shows that the Mistubishi Evolution 8 flips either 11 or 12 times before coming to a final stop alongside some small boulders.

Evolutionm.net, a Mitsubishi enthusiast's site, says that Mr Foley was able to get out of the car by himself while emergency services had to help extricate his co-driver because of a possible shoulder dislocation.

Local station KDRO reports that the rookie driver suffered a broken leg but AOL's Auto Blog contradicts that saying that neither Mr Foley nor Mr Kouznetsov broke any bones.

Coming to pieces: The engine begins to smoke the further along the crash goes

Final stop: The driver was able to get out on his own accord and his co-driver had to be lifted out by authorities because it has been reported that he suffered a possible shoulder fracture

Both men were airlifted to a local hospital and have since been released.

Mr Foley posted to his Facebook profile to relieve nervous fans.

'I thought I posted already, but Yuri and I are ok. A little beaten up but nothing major. Thank you so much to everyone for the kindness and support! What a wonderful feeling to feel so loved!' he wrote.

Mr Foley and Mr Kouznetsov were far from the only crash victims during Sunday's race, as the Colorado Springs Gazette reports that many other competitors did not complete the race because of car malfunctions and dangerous conditions and there was at least one other crash where someone turned into a patch of pine trees.
