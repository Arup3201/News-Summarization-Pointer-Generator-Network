Members of a shooting party have how a footbridge they were crossing suddenly gave way, plunging two into the river and leaving them badly injured.

The group were shooting pheasants at High Askew, near Cropton on the North Yorkshire Moors, when the metal bridge on private land collapsed.

A 65-year-old man from the York area 
was airlifted to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough with a 
head injury and a suspected broken arm.

Emergency: Two people were taken to hospital after falling into flood waters when a bridge collapsed yesterday

The other man, in his fifties, was taken by ambulance to Scarborough Hospital.

James Cook, son of shoot-organiser Michael, jumped into Hartoft Beck and helped rescue the men who had fallen into the water just before 3pm yesterday.

James and other members of the party pulled them to safety and gave them first aid until the emergency services arrived.

Both the Yorkshire and Great North Air Ambulances were called to the scene.

James, 32, said: 'The bridge just went, but it happened very quickly.

'No indication, it just went. It's been there for a long time, and we've crossed it thousands of times.

Scene: The incident happened in High Askew near Cropton, North Yorkshire

'I jumped in and got one of them out. Everyone did very well though.

'The ambulance and emergency services were there very quickly, and did excellent work. They were superb.'

Michael Wood, of Westfield Farm, Cropton, said: 'We don't know exactly what happened.

'The problem was they fell off the bridge on to the biggest rock in the river, and they fell right onto that.

'One of the men was walking but he was bleeding from his head.

'This
sort of thing has never happened before. It's a total one-off. I'm 
absolutely gobsmacked, I couldn't believe it could happen.'

A Great North Air Ambulance spokesman said: 'Both men had sustained head injuries.

'Although they had been recovered from the water, both were soaked through when our doctor and paramedic team arrived on scene.

'Other emergency services on scene had 
already prepared the patients for transfer and, after an assessment by 
the doctor, our crew flew the more seriously injured to James Cook 
University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

'As well as a head injury, the man, a 65-year-old from the York area, had sustained a suspected broken arm.'

The Yorkshire Ambulance Service sent 
two ambulances, a rapid response vehicle and a clinical supervisor in 
addition to the two air ambulances.

North Yorkshire County Council said it was trying to find out who owned the bridge.

John Clark, Ryedale District 
Councillor for Cropton, who lives a mile away from where it happened, 
said: 'I have never known the river going up and down like it has over 
the last month.

'It has been scouring away all sorts of places.'

In 2010, 53-year-old Vanessa Robson, 
from East Yorkshire, died after her Land Rover got caught in a ford 
across Hartoft Beck, less than a mile away from yesterday's incident. 
The beck was in flood at the time after several days of heavy rain and 
snow.
