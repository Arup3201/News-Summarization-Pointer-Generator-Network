Students in Oklahoma have taken to social media to blast Michelle Obama for their new school lunches.

They have posted photos of their meals which include comments such as: 'Thanks Michelle for the filling lunch' next to an image of an apple, a piece of bread and some breaded nuggets.

Another social media user wrote: 'School lunch or someone's vomit?' next to a snap of broccoli and an unidentifiable food item covered in cheese.

The new lunch complies with food regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and implemented by the USDA. 

'Chicken nuggets, with broccoli, beans and milk,' student Promise Fleming said. 'It was awful.'

Another student, A'mika Ware, told Newson 6: It's not fully cooked and it makes my stomach hurt.' 

USDA regulations now require foods in the school lunch line to be healthier.

Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools. 

Concessions sold at afterschool sports games are exempt. 

Last week a student provoked complaints by parents after taking a photo (pictured) of her paltry school meal of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower

Last week a student provoked complaints by parents after taking a photo of her paltry school meal of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower.

Kaytlin Shelton, 17, who is eight months pregnant, took a photo of the $3 meal at a Chickasha school  and showed it to her father who said it was not satisfactory.

Her father Vince Holton said: 'I can go pay a dollar for a lunchabe and get more food in it. Schools are responsible for children while they're at school.' 

The Superintendent David Cash admits the meals, which have a calorie limit dependent on the student's age, are not satisfactory.

'You've got in some cases little kids that they're only two meals are breakfast and lunch at school and they're getting you know a grand total of 1100 calories. That's not enough,' he said. 

Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat.

The new lunches comply with regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and implemented by the USDA. Pictured: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama at the White House kitchen garden with schoolchildren in Washington this week

School nutritionists and foodservice workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales.

Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards.

Mrs Obama said in July that she would 'fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'
