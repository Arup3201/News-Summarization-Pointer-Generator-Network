They say never mix politics and romance, but one Virginia delegate must have missed the memo.

Republican David Albo addressed the House of Delegates last week and described how he unsuccessfully tried to seduce his wife days before.

His wife wasn’t upset over unwashed dishes or a promise he didn’t keep – she refused him sex after seeing him support the controversial bill requiring women seeking an abortion to first get a trans-vaginal ultrasound.

Denied: Republican delegate David Albo said his wife denied him sex after seeing the debate over a controversial abortion bill forcing women to get probes before the procedure, which he supports

For all to hear: Albo took his grief to the Virginia House floor and bemoaned his chances of getting lucky

Mr Albo took the floor last Friday to tell a sad story. He had put the children to bed, and he had red wine. The night was ripe to have an intimate moment with his wife, Rita.

He said he had a ‘giant’ 48-inch television that he turned on to the Redskins game because ‘my wife loves the Redskins more than she loves me.’

He put on ‘mood music’ on the House floor and pantomimed putting his arm around his wife. But he said the romantic mood was killed while they were flipping through channels.

Mood killer? Rachel Maddow slammed GOP lawmakers in Virginia for pushing the unnecessary medical procedure on women seeking abortions in the portion of the show Albo and his wife watched

One less: Del. Albo said there would be one less Republican in this world because of watching the show

Mr Albo landed on The Rachel Maddow Show, which was discussing the details of the bill and the ‘more amazing by the minute’ stance Virginia’s Republican base has on the bills.

Rachel Maddow pointed out the hypocrisy that Virginia’s Republicans were calling for smaller government, but were fully supportive of requiring women to get a medically unnecessary ultrasound.

Del. Dave Englin, a Democrat, spoke on the show about the repercussions of the bill and what it would mean for Virginia women seeking abortions.

Mr Albo told the House floor: ‘It was trans-v this, and trans-v that.’

‘The show’s over, and she looks at me and goes, “I gotta go to bed.”’

He told the House floor: ‘If the gentleman’s plan was to make sure there was one less Republican in this world, he did it.’

His tawdry monologue was met with several cheers and guffaws as well as applause.

The bill has sparked outrage separate from the Maddow show – from spoofs on Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show With Jon Stewart to a protest outside of Capitol Hill.

Lampooned: On last week's SNL, Seth Myers and Amy Poehler also poked fun at the bill

It originally required women seeking an abortion to undergo a trans-vaginal sonogram, in which a wand is inserted in the vagina to yield an image of the fetus.

The bill originally required women seeking an abortion to undergo a trans-vaginal sonogram, in which a wand is inserted in the vagina to yield an image of the fetus. The procedure differs from an abdominal sonogram – often portrayed in movies and TV shows - in which a wand is rubbed over the woman's belly.

Seven states have laws mandating some form of pre-abortion ultrasound exam. The Guttmacher Institute, which researches abortion-related issues, said none of the ultrasound laws in other states explicitly require the trans-vaginal procedure.

However, Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher's state issues manager, said several of the laws, including a Texas measure recently upheld in federal court, effectively leave doctors with no option but the trans-vaginal procedure.

That's because an abdominal sonogram does not produce the detailed image of a first-trimester pregnancy that is required by some of the laws, Ms Nash said.

The procedure differs from an abdominal sonogram – often portrayed in movies and TV shows - in which a wand is rubbed over the woman's belly.

In part because of public ridicule, the bill is now being offered in a watered-down format and is supported by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.

Gov. Bob McDonnell and GOP state lawmakers abandoned a bill last Wednesday requiring women to undergo an intrusive type of sonogram before an abortion - an abrupt reversal that demonstrated the power of political satire and illustrated again how combustible the issue of women's reproductive health has become over the past few weeks.

'You never want to get on the wrong side of popular culture,' said Steve Jarding, a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government told the Associated Press.

In Virginia, the bill began muscling its way through a legislature that recently came under the rule of GOP conservatives.

It moved ahead despite an outcry from women and Democrats, including a female lawmaker who called it 'state-mandated rape' and another who made her point with a failed amendment requiring rectal prostate exams for men seeking Viagra prescriptions.

It didn't fully jump the fence from politics into pop culture until Saturday Night Live lampooned it on Saturday.

'Really?' comedian Amy Poehler sneered in noting the Virginia bill on SNL. 'Don't get me wrong, Transvaginal is my favourite airline. I have so many miles on Transvaginal that they upgrade me to ladybusiness.'

Stewart wisecracked that 'Transvaginal Ultrasound' was the name of a jazz fusion band he once saw in concert.

And conservative columnist Megan McCain, daughter of 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, said on MSNBC that she is 'pro-life, but I'm not pro-vaginal probing.' She added: 'I'm just horrified by this bill. As a Republican woman, I'm horrified.'

Earlier last week, more than 1,400 people — mostly women — locked arms in protest outside the Capitol, and petitions bearing more than 30,000 names were presented to McDonnell by women's groups.

Gov. McDonnell, a Roman Catholic political protege of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson who has been mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate on a ticket with Mitt Romney, backed down on Wednesday, saying: 'Mandating an invasive procedure in order to give informed consent is not a proper role for the state.'

He said he supports legislation that would require pre-abortion sonograms, but not the invasive variety.
