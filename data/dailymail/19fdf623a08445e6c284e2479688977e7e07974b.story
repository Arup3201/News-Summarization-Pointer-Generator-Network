Patrick Bamford scored three goals at the iPro Stadium during a successful loan last season that helped Derby County reach Wembley. He claimed another here of an entirely different complexion.

The 21-year-old striker, borrowed from Chelsea, delivered the cutting edge to send Middlesbrough five points clear of their promotion rivals. 

Having taken stick all game from Derby fans who once cheered him, he revelled in celebrating his defining contribution. Too right.

In the 64th minute the hosts were caught attempting to play the ball out from the back. Lee Tomlin nicked possession and threaded a pass to send Bamford clear. 

He stretched to reach it before Lee Grant and looked like he may go over when the Derby goalkeeper spread himself. 

Instead he kept his feet and his head, slotting a neat finish from a tight angle. His 16th goal of the season. Quite a way to end St Patrick’s Day.

This result will hurt Steve McClaren as much as it satisfies Aitor Karanka. Aiming for automatic promotion, Derby are faltering. 

The roar from the visiting section at the final whistle told a story. So did the solemnness with which Derby fans vacated their seats. They look set for the play-offs again at this rate.

The visitors so nearly took the lead in spectacular style five minutes before the interval. Grant raced out of his area to intercept a long punt forward but only succeeded in sending his weak clearance to the boot of Jelle Vossen.

From 40 yards out the Belgian controlled in an instant and lofted the ball high towards the goal. The capacity home crowd seemed to hold its breath as the shot hung in the air, only letting go when the ball dropped to bounce back off the post and into Grant’s arms.

It was not a first half to savour for either of these teams with Premier League aspirations. Beginning the match two points apart in fourth and third, Derby and Boro both played as if anxious to avoid defeat rather than seize victory. Quality was low, the ball often sent to the skies.

Man of the Match: Patrick Bamford

The double absence of Chris Martin and Darren Bent clipped Derby of their attacking focus in the previous three games leading to defeat and two draws.

Johnny Russell made a fist of playing the striker’s role again but as a natural winger he does not possess the hold up ability of Martin or predatory instinct on Bent.

Middlesbrough’s form entering this match was quite literally hit and miss: win followed loss in their past six games. They have struggled away from the Riverside before this.

Derby held greater possession but did not create a much. Their best opening of the first half came in the 15th minute when Tom Ince whipped a cross to the back post to Jamie Ward, who was unable to apply the killer touch from two yards.

Boro went straight down the other end with Bamford slipping in Albert Adomah to strike for goal. Grant beat away that effort and then did well to save Bamford’s follow-up too.

Five minutes after the break simmering tensions sparked into a mass melee when Jamie Hanson left Grant Leadbitter on the floor with a tackle. When referee Andy D’Urso blew for a stoppage, Vossen squared up to Hanson, prompting a dozen or so to get involved. Vossen and Cyrus Christie were booked for their parts.

Bamford had a chance to score before he did, miscuing badly from Adomah’s cross. But the mark of a good striker is showing confidence the next time. Bamford did that.

After his goal McClaren made three changes seeking to salvage something. Jesse Lingard came on and had Derby’s best chance, but dragged wide when the ball fell his way in the box.

In injury time Bamford could have doubled his tally, finding himself with a clear run at goal as Derby poured forwards. But as he closed in on Grant, Richard Keogh arrived to block his shot wide.

No matter, he was still the match winner.
