On trial: Nurse Claire Jones was allegedly strangled by her half-naked husband Royston in front of her terrified patients on the intensive care ward where she worked

A jealous husband who was high on drugs tried to murder his nurse wife on the ward where she worked because he was convinced she was having an affair, a court heard.

Royston Jones, 39, was naked from the waist-up and said he had a hand grenade as he strangled his wife Claire in front of seven patients she was treating in intensive care, it is alleged.

An unconscious Mrs Jones was only saved after her 'heroic' colleagues at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, hit him with a chair and managed to drag him off, the jury was told.

Newport Crown Court heard after being arrested he told police: 'I'll do two years for this. The court better not let me out or I'll finish the job. I won't be in jail forever.'

Jones, who denies attempted murder, was described in court as 'jealous, possessive, and aggressive' towards his wife.

Before the alleged murder attempt Mrs Jones had moved back with her mother but on one occasion he rushed into the property shouting: 'I'm going to kill her,' it was said.

Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'He was a man who was convinced his estranged wife was in another relationship. 

'He had his hands around her throat and there's no doubt he was trying to kill her by strangling her.

'Other members of staff tried to pull him away. He was too strong however and continued to try to kill her.

'Were it not for the heroic intervention of staff at that hospital, he would undoubtedly have succeeded.'  

One member of staff tried to hit him with a chair - while a consultant was kneed in the head.

The court heard how Mrs Jones, 35, told police about what happened that day.

The mother-of-three said: 'He was like a man possessed. Marching towards me, seething and glaring at me.

'All he said to me was: "You've done it now." And I said: "What have I done?"

'He put both his hands around my throat and neck and I was aware of colleagues screaming and shouting around me. They were shouting: "Get off her, get off her!''

'I lost consciousness and the next thing I remember is being dragged into an office and a colleague telling me you're alright now. My colleagues were looking at me in horror.'

Mrs Jones was then taken to the nearby accident and emergency unit where she was treated for a swollen neck and throat, elbow and back injuries.

She told the police in her interview: 'I feel confused why he did this. He thought I was with someone that day but I wasn't.

'He's very paranoid, thinking I have someone with me.'

Newport Crown Court heard Jones had a history of drug abuse - and had taken drugs that day with the intent of killing his wife.

The jury heard a recording of a phone call between a police officer and Claire in the seconds leading up to the attack - before screams could be heard.

In another recording heard in court, a staff member told police that patients at the intensive care unit were 'terrified' as the attack unfolded.

Jones, of Brynmawr, Gwent, denies attempted murder.

The trial continues.
