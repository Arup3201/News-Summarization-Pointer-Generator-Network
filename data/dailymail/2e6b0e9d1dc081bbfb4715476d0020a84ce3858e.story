The real-life Wolf of Wall Street has defended his upcoming Masters of Wealth speaking tour where he will teach Australians how to 'ethically' make money - while he is still paying back more than $98 million he owes to investors.

Jordan Belfort, whose debaucherous rise to riches at the helm of stockbroking firm Stratton Oakmont was portrayed in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film, is preparing to run a series of workshops in Sydney and Melbourne in March.

These include one day talks and a $2497 three-day boot camp teaching wealth-seekers the secrets of persuasion and success.

Stratton Oakmont investors – who lost about $200 million through the firm's stock price manipulation in the late 1980s and 1990s – are still waiting on Belfort to repay in full the $110 million in restitution that he was ordered to pay when convicted of fraud and money laundering in 2004.

A CNBC profile on Belfort, which aired on Thursday night in the U.S., said Belfort had still paid less than $12 million.

But Belfort defended his suitability to give the workshops he says will help Australian business owners and investors 'take their wealth to the next level'.

'I don't see what I did 25 years ago has to do with what I do today,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I have an ability to help and motivate and train and power entrepreneurs and sales people.'

He said it was a 'fallacy' that he had not paid back the U.S. government-ordered restitution.

'The answer is I paid back a lot of money, there's whole controversy that I was underpaying but in fact the judge ruled in my favour.

'The government was wrong I overpaid what I was supposed to pay.

'I still continue to pay all the time, all the book money goes back to investors and the movie money and I pay extra money towards it myself.'

The CNBC American Greed program reported that Belfort says he doesn't have to pay any more of the money now his probation is over but that he 'wants to'.

But the U.S. Attorney says Belfort has to give half of his income towards his judgement.
