The Rockefeller family are one of America's best known dynasties but among the tales of business acumen and astounding wealth are stories of tragedy.

From mistresses and depression, to cannibalism and even an imposter who hid behind the famed name before being charged with murder, the family has endured a tragic side.

The most recent heartbreak for the family came on Friday, when Richard Rockefeller, the great grandson of oil baron John D. Rockefeller, died when his light aircraft crashed outside New York City.

The 65-year-old doctor had, like many of his relatives, enjoyed a successful career. He had been returning to his Maine home after celebrating his father's 99th birthday.

Family spokesman Fraser Seitel told the Portland Press Herald: 'The
 family is in shock. This was a terrible tragedy. Richard was a 
wonderful cherished son and brother, father, husband and grandfather.

'He
 was an experienced pilot and a respected medical doctor, who most 
recently was working on treating PTSD in veterans. And it’s just 
horribly sad.'

Dr Rockefeller's family first made their fortune when John D. Rockefeller co-founded Standard Oil in 1870, bringing affordable indoor lighting to American homes.

While he lived to the grand age of 97, several of his descendants had their lives cut short in tragic circumstances.

One of the first tragedies to befall the family came in 1951, when Rockefeller's great-niece Winifred, killed herself and two of her children at their Greenwich home, LoHud reported.

Just ten years later, in 1961, Michael Rockefeller died in mysterious circumstances while gathering indigenous art in New Guinea.

MIchael, whose father Nelson was Governor of New York, had been canoeing down a river when his boat capsized.

No body was ever found, but it was widely believed that he made it to shore, only to be eaten by cannibals.

His twin sister, Mary Rockefeller 
Morgan, dismissed the rumors that he was eaten, but said it took years 
for her to get over the devastation of losing her 23-year-old brother.

'Nobody
 knows what happened to Michael, and that leaves our family in a 
terrible place of not knowing,' she told People magazine. I wanted him 
to be alive so much that sometimes I thought I saw him in a crowd.'

The death of the twins' father was also shrouded in mystery after Nelson Rockefeller, who served four terms as New York Governor, died at home with his 25-year-old assistant in 1979.

It was alleged that the assistant Megan Marshack was having an affair with Nelson - a former Vice President - and that she waited an hour before calling for help when he died, according to the New York Post.

A year before his own death, Nelson's brother John Rockefeller III was killed when his car was involved in a deadly head-on crash near the family's Pocantico Hills estate.

The weight of the family's reputation and success has also played heavily on descendants of the oil baron and founding father.

Eileen Rockefeller, a great-granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller, revealed last year that her mother battled with depression and her father was consumed with boardroom meetings during her childhood.

She told CBS: 'There is no question that the privileges have way outweighed the responsibilities, the difficulties. But where I think I feel common ground with everybody watching is that we all suffer from something growing up.

Ambitious: As well as being governor, Nelson served as Vice President under Ford

'It doesn't matter if we have money or don't have money; we suffer in our own ways. And the net worth of our bank account is not nearly so important, ultimately, as the self-worth.'

She added that the accomplishments of the family made her own successes feel overshadowed.

'Every time in any high school paper, college paper, where I had attempted to write anything about my family I would just feel overwhelmed by how much had been accomplished and no matter what I did I would feel so small,' Ms Rockefeller said. 

Perhaps the most high-profile scandal involving the Rockefeller name didn't actually involve an actual member of the family.

A con artist and convicted murderer Christian Gerhartsreiter managed to wile his way into the heart of the art world and establishment by posing as Clark Rockefeller.

His
 tangled web of lies fell apart when he kidnapped his daughter during a 
custody battle, and was finally sentenced to prison for the murder of 
John Sohus, the son of his former landlady.

The fake Rockefeller is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence.

The oldest living family member in the dynasty is David Rockefeller who, at 99 years old, is ranked by Forbes as the 49th-richest person in the 
world, worth an estimated $2.7 billion.
