The remains of the first emperor of Brazil Dom Pedro I and his two wives have been exhumed 180 years after he died which could re-write the history of the country.

Tests were carried out in secrecy between February and September 2012 by historian and archaeologist Valdirene Carmo Ambiel at the University of Sao Paulo who hopes to shed more light on the Imperial family.

Over three mornings, the remains were transported from the Brazilian Imperial Crypt, in Independence Park, to the university's medical school.

Researchers discovered the emperor had four fractured ribs on the left side which would have crippled one of his lungs and may have aggravated the tuberculosis that killed him at age 36 in 1834.

The injuries were the result of falling from a horse in 1823 and a chariot in 1829.

Surprisingly, when his casket was brought up, there was no insignia or Brazilian emblem among the five medals found with the skeleton.

The first emperor of Brazil was buried as a Portuguese general wearing cavalry boots.

Historic: Researchers hope to find out more about Brazil's first Imperial family

The only reference to the period Pedro ruled Brazil is the cover of one of his coffins which reads: 'First Emperor of Brazil' beside 'King of Portugal and Algarves.'

For the first time, the country's largest hospital complex was used for historic research which carried out hours of scans using state-of-the-art equipment.

His two wives, Dona Leopoldina and Dona Amelia of Leuchtenberg were also examined.

The most surprising find was that Dona Amelia of Leuchtenberg, Dom Pedro's second wife, was mummified and preserved so well you can see her hair, nails and even eyelashes.

Within her well-preserved hands, which still have skin on, she holds a crucifix made of wood and metal.

It had been thought that the emperor's first wife Dona Leopoldina, had fallen or been thrown down a staircase in the palace of Quinta da Boa Vista, where the Royal family lived. However radiographers could not verify in she had fractured bones.

A medical researcher said: 'The lab was transformed with professionals using the latest equipment for the sake of historical research.

'The material collected will be useful to continue the research in several areas over the coming years.'

Exhumed: The research showed Dom Pedro I had four fractured ribs which could have led to him getting tuberculosis

Pedro I was born October 12, 1798, in Lisbon, Portugal and was the founder of the Brazilian empire and first emperor of Brazil from 1822. He was also crowned King Pedro IV of Portugal. 

Generally known as Dom Pedro, he was the son of King John VI of Portugal. 

When Napoleon conquered Portugal in 1807, Pedro accompanied the royal family in its flight to Brazil. He remained there as regent when King John returned to Portugal in 1821.

Pedro surrounded himself with ministers who counseled independence. 

When the Portuguese parliament, preferring colonial status for Brazil, demanded that Pedro return to Lisbon to 'complete his political education,' he issued a declaration of Brazilian independence on September 7, 1822. Within three months he was crowned emperor.

Pedro’s initial popularity waned, and in 1823, when the Brazilian Assembly was preparing a liberal constitution, he dissolved that body and exiled the radical leader José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva. 

On March 25, 1824, however, Pedro accepted a somewhat less liberal constitution drafted by the Council of State at his request. 

Although adoption of that charter may have saved Pedro from deposition, it did not reestablish his popularity.

His autocratic manner, his lack of enthusiasm for parliamentary government, and his continuing deep interest in Portuguese affairs antagonised his subjects, as did the failure of his military forces in a war with Argentina over what is now Uruguay. 

Strong opposition in the Brazilian Parliament and a series of local uprisings induced him to abdicate in 1831 in favour of his son Dom Pedro II, who was then five-years-old. Pedro I then returned to Portugal.

On the death of King John VI in 1826, Pedro I had become titular king of Portugal as Pedro IV. 

Two months later, still in Brazil, he issued a parliamentary charter for Portugal and conditionally abdicated the Portuguese throne in favour of his daughter Maria da Glória, the future Queen Maria II. 

He died of natural causes in Portugal while securing his daughter’s claim against that of his brother, the regent Miguel.
