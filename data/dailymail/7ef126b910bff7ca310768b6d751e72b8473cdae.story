Close: Prince Charles and butler Michael Fawcett. People quoted in the book report 'bruising experiences' with Fawcett

Rampant feuding, squabbling and backstabbing among Prince Charles’s courtiers has seen the heir’s household nicknamed Wolf Hall.

Biographer Catherine Mayer said a ‘former householder’ made the comparison to ‘the treacherous and opportunistic world depicted by Hilary Mantel in her fictionalised account of the rise of Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII’.

The author claims that Clarence House has ‘glaring systemic weaknesses’ and is riven by intense rivalries between several staff factions. 

‘It is hard to know who can be trusted, and criticism can send the prince into despair,’ she adds.

On one occasion, the divisions reportedly led to the collapse of a multi-million-pound deal to base all of Charles’s charities in one site. More than £100,000 was said to have been wasted on the deal.

One businessman who helped the household to organise an event said: ‘No company would be expected to run along these lines. There was a lot of backstabbing.’

An insider added: ‘There are certain people who, because they’re pretty cunning in the dark arts but loyal and able and are good in their timing, also involve themselves in the dark arts of undermining other people. I think [the prince] hasn’t always been best served by this.’

Others quoted in the book recount ‘bruising experiences’ with Michael Fawcett, Charles’s former personal assistant who was rumoured to squeeze the prince’s toothpaste for him. Mr Fawcett, who remains a close adviser despite having resigned his post in 2003, is described as one of the most talented individuals in the household, praised for his ‘gimlet eye for detail’.

Miss Mayer also describes how he mixes easily with ‘Bond villains’ – the wealthy donors entertained by the prince.

She suggests, however, that Charles ‘hasn’t always chosen his sages wisely’, and has instead been surrounded by by those who tell him what he wants to hear.

‘That factor, combined with his native insecurity, means he doesn’t always believe that he’s earned the praise that comes his way, while criticism has the power to cast him into despair.’

The heir is said to be called ‘The Boss’ by his staff – but also apparently identifies with Blackadder’s bumbling Baldrick.
