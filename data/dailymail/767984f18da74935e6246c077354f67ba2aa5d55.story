Ros Altmann, the Government’s business champion for older workers, said it was ‘astonishing’ that NS&I had failed to predict how big demand would be

Around 100 extra staff have been drafted in to man a call centre selling the Government’s new pensioner bonds after a buying frenzy caused phonelines to jam and the website to crash.

More than £1billion of the bonds were sold to 110,000 over-65s in the first two days they were on sale. 

Only £10billion-worth are available, sparking fears that they would sell out.

Customers complained that the National Savings and Investments (NS&I) website, which sells the bonds, crashed after payment details had been entered.

Repeated error messages caused one man to reportedly re-enter his details four times, only to discover all the payments had gone through and £40,000 was due to leave his bank account instead of the intended £10,000.

And NS&I admitted that it was having to bring in another 100 staff after the chaotic launch saw its dedicated 24-hour phoneline swamped with calls.

It had already increased the number of call centre workers from 300 to 600 before the scenes of panic on Thursday, and brought in a further 430 additional office staff to process applications.

Yesterday the Government’s business champion for older workers, Ros Altmann, said it was ‘astonishing’ that NS&I had failed to predict how big initial demand would be.

She said: ‘Savers have had such a raw time for five years, they are desperate, and this is the first really good savings product launched for years. 

'It is a shame there have been so many problems. I hope they will now be able to sell it all smoothly.’

Anna Bowes, from savings advice site savingschampion.co.uk, said she had been contacted by people who were ‘worried and upset’ about problems buying the bonds.

Pensioners who had moved large sums of money from their savings to current accounts in order to pay by direct debit had also been in touch, concerned about losing interest. But George Osborne said the sale had been ‘hugely successful’ with £1,153million of bonds sold in only two days.

In a statement he said: ‘Our economic plan involves supporting savers and I’m delighted to report that it is proving hugely popular.

‘I can confirm that the latest figures show that our 65+ Pensioner Bond has had the biggest opening sales of any retail financial product in Britain’s modern history.

‘£1,150million of these bonds have now been sold in the first two days, to over 110,000 pensioners. 

'There’s plenty more available as we’re offering up to £10billion for sale, so we expect them to be on sale for months. 

'It just shows what an appetite there is for an economic plan that rewards savers.’

A NS&I spokesman said its website was now ‘operating normally’ and pointed out that customers could also apply by post. 

People who have inadvertently made more than one payment will automatically be refunded from today and do not need to contact NS&I.
