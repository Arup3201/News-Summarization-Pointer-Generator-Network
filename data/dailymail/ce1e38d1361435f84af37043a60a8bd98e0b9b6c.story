Manchester City's players have plenty of reasons to smile after their 4-1 win against Sunderland on Wednesday night but they were in far more sombre mood ahead of kick-off at the Stadium of Light.

In another of their popular Christmas videos, the club's media department challenged six of Manuel Pellegrini's first-team to avoid laughing during funny YouTube clips

David Silva, Pablo Zabaleta, Eliaquim Mangala, Aleksandar Kolarov, Martin Demichelis and Edin Dzeko agreed to take part, with mixed results to say the least.

Summer signing Eliaquim Mangala also showed his sense of humour by taking part in the festive video

City's stars took turns to sit in front of a laptop and watch a quartet of hilarious clips posted on the internet's most popular video-sharing site. 

Dzeko didn't get off to a good start, finding it difficult to compose himself before the play button had even been clicked.

And the Bosnian striker didn't last much longer, eventually letting out a giggle towards the end of the first baby-themed clip as Zabaleta also bowed out early on in the competition.

The second video, a clip showing a baby chuckling at sheets of paper being torn, failed to claim any victims but the straight faces didn't last long.

Another hilarious baby clip meant Spanish midfielder David Silva bowed out at the final video

Demichelis couldn't stop himself laughing at a man inexplicably launching himself into a wall, while Silva and Mangala cracked when shown a baby attempting a Kung Fu impression.

That left Kolarov, famed for his hard exterior after his not-so-festive rendition of Jingle Bills two years ago, as the winner.

After being informed that he'd completed the challenge and that the clips were the best City's media team could find, the defender responded: 'This one? Not for me. Where is my present?'

That could well be the easiest victory a City player has this season.
