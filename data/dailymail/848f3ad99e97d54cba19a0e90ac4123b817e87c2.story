If and when Leicestershire finally win a game of four-day cricket, there will be no bunting, no champagne and definitely no complacency. 

So says Wasim Khan, who in January will become the club’s new chief executive after nine years in charge of the Cricket Foundation charity. Let no one accuse him of taking the easy option.

You have to go back to September 2012 for the last time Leicestershire won a match in the County Championship – a tense two-wicket triumph over Gloucestershire which spared them a third wooden spoon in four years.

What a heady memory that seems now. In the past two summers Leicestershire have played 32 Championship winless matches, becoming the first team since Northamptonshire in the 1930s to go through successive seasons without a single victory.

The unkind view is that Khan will be able to use the latest batch of spoons to mix the poison in the chalice.

But Leicestershire need not be a laughing-stock: as recently as the late 1990s, they were one of the best teams in the country, and they have won three Twenty20 Cups – more than anyone. Equally, Khan has not risen to the heights of chief executive at the relatively tender age of 43 without suggesting he has something about him.

When he first broke into the highly successful Warwickshire side of the mid-1990s, averaging 46 in a team that included Nick Knight, Dermot Reeve, Ashley Giles and Allan Donald, he did so as the first British-born Asian cricketer to play for a county.

Now, he is the first non-white county chief executive, and there are many within the game who believe he can go all the way. Regardless of what happens next, he has already proved himself capable of defying expectation. And he has not set the bar low.

‘I see three main elements to my job,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘We have to make Leicestershire more sustainable financially. We have to do a lot more to establish an emotional connect with the local community, which hasn’t always happened before. And we need to improve standards on the field. Poor performances are not acceptable.’

Leicestershire has developed an unfortunate reputation as a feeder club for more prosperous rivals, particularly Nottinghamshire, who over the past few years have gobbled up the likes of Stuart Broad, James Taylor and Harry Gurney. In recent weeks, others have followed suit: Josh Cobb (to Northamptonshire), Nathan Buck (Lancashire) and Shiv Thakor (Derbyshire).

But Khan believes the process can be reversed – to the extent of turning Leicestershire into the leading county outside the Test venues within five years. ‘It’s massively ambitious,’ he admits. ‘But why not?

‘If we become more commercially viable – through increasing our membership, hosting more events and encouraging people to use our facilities – then we can attract better players. There are passionate people at the club who don’t want to settle for mediocrity. My job is to galvanise them and create the right environment for success.’

The former Australian Test all-rounder Andrew McDonald is set to take over as coach, while the highly regarded Australian seamer Clint McKay has joined the club for 2015. There is also talk of signing Australian batsman Mark Cosgrove. One way or another, there will be little shortage of Aussie grit.

A different demographic, however, could prove more crucial to Leicestershire’s long-term success – not to mention the club’s viability as one of 18 first-class counties who receive money each year from the ECB to sustain them.

Leicester was one of the first towns in the UK in which the non-white community became the majority, and Khan regards it as his job to find out why more of the large south Asian population has not been snapped up by the cricket team.

‘We have to create an emotional connection with them,’ he says. ‘Lots of county age-group sides all round the country contain a high percentage of non-white players, yet there is a relatively low percentage of them in first-class cricket. There is clearly some blockage somewhere, and that is not specific to Leicestershire.

‘But hopefully, as someone who grew up within that community if you like, I can help break those down. When you speak to the south Asian community, the message is that they don’t feel welcome, that Leicestershire is not their club. There has been some truth in that, but it to be a two-way process. It can’t all be take, take, take.

‘I want to get into Leicester and find out what exactly the issues have been. Hopefully they might look at me and think that there is an opportunity in cricket for British-born Asians.’

It is an area in which Leicestershire have the potential to lead the way. If Khan gets it right, the whole of English cricket will be in his debt.
