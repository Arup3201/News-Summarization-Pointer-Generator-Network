The bizarre celebrity feud between news anchor Anderson Cooper and Smashing Pumpkins singer Billy Corgan just got stranger.

At the band's show on Wednesday night, a T-shirt on sale featured a picture of his pet cats, but also had a clear message to his unusual nemesis.

The organic cotton shirt, adorned with two cat picture, also said: 'F*** You Anderson Cooper.'

At the Smashing Pumpkins show this week, merchandise available included this t-shirt featuring Corgan's cats and a clear message for his nemesis

@ZuZusTeahouse posted a picture of the merchandise on Twitter with the message: 'Awesome tea and Merch at the @SmashingPumpkins concert tonight!! Limited quantity available so get them early!'

The row started this summer when Corgan appeared on the cover of PAWS Chicago, reports Gawker.

The organizations runs a pet adoption center and neuter clinic and Corgan posed on their magazine with two cats that he adopted called Sammi and Mr Thom.

The headline 'Billy Corgan's Siamese Dream' referred to the alternative band's second album released in 1993.  

He has supported the organization in the past, raising $60,000 after auctioning off a private concert.

But when Cooper discovered the cover last month, he ridiculed it live on air.

He said: 'So perhaps Billy Corgan is, I don't know, off his alternative rocker. 

 

Corgan, pictured on stage at Glastonbury last year, responded on Twitter calling Cooper a 'globalist shill'

'But I think maybe there's more to this, maybe he's being ironic, or maybe when the cool rock stars start doing less rock starry things, it kind of makes us face our own mortality. 

'See I want REM to stay just the way I know and love them, I don't want 'Everybody Hurts' to suddenly be used in an Excedrin commercial.'

He added: 'Maybe the Internet is the real problem here. There was a time when nobody outside of Chicago would have ever seen the cover of PAWS Chicago magazine.' 

Corgan responded with a tweet calling Cooper a 'globalist shill' and adding: 'Sorry to disappoint, but when I'm not raising cain for a great organization like @PAWSchicago, I'm still making REAL music.'
