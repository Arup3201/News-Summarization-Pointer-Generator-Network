These stunning photographs, selected for the Royal Photographic Society’s latest exhibition, highlight the incredible beauty of scientific research.

The sensational images come from various disciplines of science and highlight how important photography is for academics.

The photographs form a dazzling display of the world’s best scientific photography going on show to the public.

Stunning photographs from the prestigious Royal Photographic Society's latest exhibition prove that science and beauty can co-exist. This image is a polarised light micrograph of a sample of ocean jasper by Bernardo Cesare. This volcanic 'ocean jasper' is found only in Madagascar and is highly prized among collectors. Here a thin section of rock just 30 micrometres thick has been polished and polarised light shone through it. A second polarising filter reveals these amazing colours

The Royal Photographic Society’s International Images for Science exhibition showcases works from 54 scientists from around the world.

Photography skills play a crucial role in medicine, forensic science, engineering, archaeology, oceanography, natural history and many more areas.

The exhibition celebrates the use of photography in science and shows that academia and beauty can collide.

Among the highlights is a fascinating close-up of a doliolid, a microscopic marine animal photographed by Plymouth marine expert Dr Richard Kirby.

Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins on an ice floe near Danko Island in the Antarctic by David Doubilet. The photographer observed them pushing each other off the floe and swimming in the water as if playing a game of tag

Extreme close-up view of the head of a Yellow Paper wasp by Daniel Kariko. Many species build their nests on human habitation, while not normally aggressive paper wasps will defend their nests vigorously. This image is part of a series investigating our often-overlooked housemates

Another star of the show is a jellyfish imaged using x-rays in a micro-CT scanner by Dan Sykes of the Natural History Museum’s Imaging and Analysis Centre.

Other subjects include a human lymphocyte cell, the head of a weevil, a mouse embryo and blood cells inside a blood vessel.

Dr Michael Pritchard, director general of the Royal Photographic Society, said: 'The society was founded in 1853 to promote the art and science of photography and we’ve have been doing just that ever since.

‘We held the first International Images for Science exhibition in 2011 and it went down extremely well.'

Weevil found on front porch doormat by Daniel Kariko. There are over 40,000 species of true weevils in the family Circulionidae, beetle-like creatures typified by a long snout and clubbed antennae

Scanning electron micrograph of nanoswimmers on the beach by David McCarthy, University College London. These are microscopic objects being investigated for use as drug carriers in medicine. Each tiny coil is just 25 micrometres long, 5 micrometres wide and 300 nanometres thick

Extreme close-up view of the head of a cuckoo wasp by Daniel Kariko. Common names also include jewel wasp, gold wasp or emerald wasp, reflecting their brilliantly coloured, metal-like bodies

A human lymphocyte cell by David Scharf. These natural killer Lymphocyte cells are a part of the immune system and play a major role in defending the host from both tumors and virally-infected cells

‘The 2013 show builds on that success and takes it to a new level,' added Dr Pritchard.

‘Photography and specialised imaging techniques continue to play an essential role for scientists.

‘These images have been used to support scientific research or medical diagnosis, to illustrate learned papers and presentations, to show the places in which science is undertaken, or simply to represent the beauty that exists in the natural world and in worlds that are normally invisible to the wider public.

‘Some of these images look something out of science fiction but they come from the everyday world we live in.

‘The exhibition is a real visual feast.’

The left image shows the collision of two water droplets beneath a bursting soap bubble by Greg Parker, Hampshire. The image was captured using a Canon 5D Mark II SLR camera and a xenon flash unit with an exposure time of 9 microseconds. The right image unique fishbone pattern is created by two colliding steams of liquids by Ted Kinsman.  The pattern is currently the focus of scientists studying the strange world of fluid dynamics

Coloured scanning electron micrograph of a Leafcutter Ant holding a gear from a icromechanical device by Manfred P Kage. The gear is about 0.1mm wide

Light micrograph of the adult doliolid doliolum nationalis by Dr Richard Kirby, University Of Plymouth. This 1.5 mm long, adult doliolid possesses bands of muscle around its barrel-shaped body that help it swim and feed as it drifts among the plankton at the sea surface

The application of photography to science is almost as old as photography itself.

As early as 1872, Eadweard Muybridge, a British-born photographer, used photography to study and analyse motion in horses.

Since then, by using invisible radiation, new techniques and methods of photography have arisen.

This has happened, for example, through sophisticated scientific instruments such as fibre optics, endoscopes, microscopes, telescopes, stereo microscopes and ophthalmoscopes.

Coloured scanning electron micrograph showing red and white blood cells inside a small blood vessel by Steve Gschmeissner, Bedfordshire. The sample was prepared by freeze fracturing, rapidly freezing the sample with liquid nitrogen such that tissues are instantly preserved. If the sample is broken, the inner structures are revealed. In this frame, a tiny vein, or venule, has been opened to show the blood cells inside

Human cortical neurons with interconnecting dendrites, 4,200X by David Scharf. Cortical Neurons make up the brain's cortex which in part makes up the cerebral cortex, responsible for memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness

3D reconstruction of a glass model of a jellyfish, imaged using X-rays in a micro-CT scanner by Dan Sykes, Natural History Museum. The artificial colours used here are based on the density of the glass. This incredible model was sculpted in glass in the mid-19th Century by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka. The techniques used by this father and son team are not fully understood, it is hoped that this study will help reveal some of their secrets

‘Gone are the days when we were restricted to 1000 ISO emulsion sensitivity,’ said Dr Afzal Ansary, exhibition co-ordinator.

‘Today, DSLR cameras with full frame sensors have the ability to process images that reduce noise in low light conditions. We have CCD sensors, sensitive to much higher ISO sensitivities which can yield usable images.

‘We used to say that, “if you can see it, it can be photographed” and now we say, “even if you cannot see it, we most likely can photograph it”.’

The International Images for Science exhibition launches at the Great North Museum in Hancock, Newcastle, tomorrow.

It will then go on a tour of the UK from October 1 before heading to Europe.

A porcelain crab feeding inside the safety of its host Pocillopora coral branches by Louise Murray from London. It is lit by the bright green fluorescence of the coral. These are normally very shy creatures and are difficult to photograph

Light micrograph of a mouse embryo, approximately 10.5 days post-fertilisation by Jim Swoger. The specimen was stained with a fluorescent marker that highlights the presence of precursor cells to nerve tissue then chemically treated to make it optically transparent. It was scanned using Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy to produce a series of optical ëslicesí that were combined to generate a virtual 3D model of the embryo

Triple exposure image showing a seed falling from a Sycamore tree by Adrian Davies, Surrey. This image was created in three exposures; the first with flash to show the leaves and seeds, the next a half-second exposure showing the spiralling fall and the last a flash exposure to freeze the seed at the bottom of its descent
