Referee Anthony Taylor failed to send off Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Robert Green  for  handling the ball outside of the 18-yard box during their 1-1 draw with 10-man Swansea City.

QPR should have been down to 10 men  after just five minutes on a New Year's Day to  remember for controversial decisions from Barclays Premier League officials.

Gylfi Sigurdsson cut the QPR defence open with a through ball to give Wayne Routledge an early one-on-one chance, only for Green to deny the winger with his hand outside of the area.

Routledge himself was later sent off in the 86th minute for kicking out at QPR's Karl Henry. 

Fifteen minutes after referee Taylor failed to punish Green, QPR took the lead through Leroy Fer. 

Swansea manager Garry Monks was left incensed by Taylor's decisions.

He said: ‘I am losing a bit of faith and so are my players when we continuously have decisions like this.

‘I just hope Wayne’s card gets rescinded. He goes from nearly having a leg broken to being sent off. He (Routledge) nudges him (Henry) away. No justice whatsoever.

‘With the other one (Green’s handball) it is a half metre outside the box.’

Justice was perhaps served when Wilfried Bony snatched a point with a 90th-minute equaliser, despite Swansea being a man shy following Routledge's dismissal.

It was among several other controversial decisions on Thursday, including two questionable penalties from Mike Jones at Anfield to give Liverpool a two-goal lead by half time.

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker labelled Jones's first the 'worst penalty decision ever' before adding: 'Wait until you see some of the refereeing decisions on MOTD. I reckon some of them may have been celebrating too hard last night.'
