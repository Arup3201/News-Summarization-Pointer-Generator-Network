Jamie Carragher has heaped praise on Liverpool's resilience after they produced a hard-fought away performance at Southampton to take all three points.

Brendan Rodgers' side are now 10 games unbeaten in the Premier League since a defeat to Manchester United in December, and Carragher has been impressed with their desire to win.

'It was (a proper away performance from Liverpool), and a lot of that came from Southampton, who forced and pushed them back,' Sportsmail's Carragher said on Sky Sports after the match.

'What I've liked from Liverpool, today and midweek (against Besiktas in the Europa League), is that they weren't at their best in terms of how they've played with this new system, but they've fought and got a victory. They haven't played great, but they won.

'In the last few months since that Manchester United game, when things changed - the system, the performances and the results - they've been superb. The last two games they haven't been like that, but they've won. That's going back to the Liverpool I know when I played. Every time they play, you think they're going to keep it tight.'

Even more impressive, Liverpool's defence has been tight away from home. The Reds have not conceded a goal in the Premier League away from Anfield since the aforementioned defeat to United in the middle of December.

'When you don't play well, you rely on your defenders, and I think that's five clean sheets now, away... the best since 1985,' Carragher continued. 

'I can't believe they've broken a defensive record and I'm not involved in it! 30 years we're going back; that shows how good it is, and I'm not involved in it.' 

Jordon Ibe was chosen in Liverpool's starting line-up for the game at St Mary's; a bold decision from Liverpool boss Rodgers, but one that paid off.

Former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry was alongside Carragher in the Sky studio, and he was impressed by the 19-year-old.

'One of his mistakes, he got caught ball-watching, but he did his work really well,' Henry told Sky Sports. 'Today he had an amazing performance. He wasn't [doing] step-overs and nutmegs, but he showed maturity in the game at an early age. 

'He knew at one point that he needed to tuck in. It's the way he did it, to show that he could cover his back three. He never gave up, he always worked hard for his team-mates, and that's how you earn respect. 

Ibe is a young player that Carragher will have come into contact with at Liverpool in his final year as a professional. After joining from Wycombe Wanderers in 2012, the winger began his rise to the Liverpool first team, and Carragher was also impressed with his performance against Southampton.

'I'm not criticising Markovic, but he's a £20million signing and he had to come off because he was finding it difficult. This young lad's (Ibe's) understanding of the game... A young wide player is the one player in football that a manager will always mistrust. He'll always look at a big away game, and think "I'll take the young wide player out". 

'Now, he's playing in the wing-back position. The fact that he's stayed on, and the other fella (Markovic) has had to come off. It's not about going forward today, he virtually played at right-back. His understanding is brilliant, and long may it continue.'
