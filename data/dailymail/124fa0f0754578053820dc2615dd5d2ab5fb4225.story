Real Madrid have had a year to remember as they sit at the peak of the La Liga table during the Christmas break. 

The Spanish giants have won their last 22 consecutive games in all competitions with Gareth Bale chipping in with 10 goals in those encounters. 

Therefore many wouldn't be too aggrieved at the Real players for wanting to take a bit of a break over the festive period... but Bale does not plan on stopping.

Gareth Bale took to his Twitter account to post a picture of him doing some night time training on Tuesday

Looking rather chilly as he posted a picture to his Twitter on Tuesday night, Bale said: 'Enjoying the Christmas period, and a bit of late night training. Got to stay on this winning streak!!'

Since his £85million move from Tottenham, the 25-year-old has already won four trophies in his time at the Spanish club - the Champions League, Spanish Cup, Euro Super Cup and, this week, the Club World Cup.

That said, his efforts to remain on top of his game may not be fully appreciated by everybody at the Bernabeu, with 54% of fans saying they would happily see the Welsh star sold to the highest bidder. 

With Real Madrid supporters supposedly happy to let Gareth Bale leave if a bid of more than €150million was tabled, and Manchester United reportedly sniffing around, maybe Louis van Gaal is keeping a close eye on Bale's efforts.
