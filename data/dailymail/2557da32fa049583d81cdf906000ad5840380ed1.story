Emergency services found Mr Thompson and the 53-year-old gunman dead at Meadowhead Farm in Auldhouse, South Lanarkshire.

John Thompson is recovering in 
Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride where his condition was described as
stable.

The 53-year-old, who was a registered firearms owner, is not related to the other two men.

Mr Thompson and his son ran the farm 
which had been closed at the weekend due to an infectious disease scare 
involving one horse.

A floral tribute left at the scene read: 'RIP Peter. A true gentleman. You will be sadly missed.'

Police also said armed officers had 
attended a location in Clarkston, near Glasgow, in relation to the 
incident at around 10am which resulted in them taking in a male witness for questioning.

Police sealed off the farm and a nearby pub today as the hunt for clues to the incident was stepped up.

Shock: Peter Thompson was found dead at the scene along with the 53-year-old gunman

Response: Armed officers swooped on the farm at around 8am after John Thompson escaped the scene with gunshot wounds to his legs

Officers
have urged the public to remain calm and it is believed the Thompsons 
were deliberately targeted at the rural equestrian centre by the unnamed
gunman.

According to the East Kilbride News, Mr Thompson was fined £10,000 last year for illegally dumping landfill at the the farm as part of plans to expand the equestrian centre.

Residents had complained that trucks bringing infill had damaged an access road and some believed planning permission for the expansion should never have been approved.

Mr Thompson pleaded guilty to breaching planning regulations but accused the local council of 'bullying' tactics.

'This decision and fine will have no effect whatsoever on Meadowhead Management moving this development of an equestrian centre forward,' he told the East Kilbride News at the time.

Police say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting and no danger is posed to the public.

Superintendent Elaine Ferguson of 
Police Scotland told a press conference: 'At 10 past eight this morning 
Police Scotland received a call from ambulance control.

'They had had a 
report of a male having been shot in Meadowhead Farm in the East 
Kilbride area.

'Specialist 
firearms resources attended, backed up by local officers and we can 
confirm that a male aged 59 and a male aged 53 have been fatally 
injured.

Emergency services raced to the scene at Meadowhead Farm and are now looking for clues to the incident

Officers have urged the public to remain calm and it is believed the Thompsons were deliberately targeted

'A 36-year-old man 
is currently in hospital being treated. We can confirm that the 
59-year-old and the 36-year-old are father and son.

'The incident happened within the farm area.

'When we were dealing with this incident we received information that led us to the Clarkston area.

'We deployed further resources and a 
male is now a witness in relation to the first incident although he 
wasn't at the farm at the time.

'We
are not looking for anybody else in relation to this incident and all 
the firearms are contained to that farm and there is no danger to the 
public.'

that led to this tragic incident.'

Stunned locals have told of their 
shock after the incident at the popular farm which is used for horse 
riding lessons and livery stables.

A neighbour said: 'I woke up this morning about 8am after heading a helicopter over head.

'It kept flying back and forth and then landed somewhere nearby.

'Then I heard a police car and an ambulance. I went out and spoke to one of my neighbours who said someone had been shot.

Police have said the shootings were 'targeted' and they were following a 'positive line of enquiry'

Police were called to Meadowhead Farm
at about 8.10am and the village of Chapeltown was put into 'lockdown'
