Missing girl: Madeleine McCann who has not been seen since vanishing from her family's holiday apartment in 2007

Police in Portugal have reopened their inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, five years after they controversially shelved the investigation.

The country’s attorney general authorised the move yesterday after ‘highly significant’ new evidence was identified by local detectives.

She said ‘new elements of evidence’ and new witnesses justified the continuation of the original investigation.

Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry, who were wrongly suspected of being responsible for their daughter’s disappearance during the shambolic first inquiry by Portuguese police, welcomed the news.

‘We are very pleased. We hope that this will finally lead to her being found and to the discovery of whoever is responsible for this crime,’ they said in a statement.

The new investigation will work with Scotland Yard’s multi-million-pound inquiry into Madeleine’s disappearance, which was the subject of a major appeal on BBC1’s Crimewatch programme last week.

She was three when she disappeared from the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in May 2007.

Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 and opened a formal investigation in July this  year after identifying dozens of potential suspects and scores of new lines of inquiry.

Portuguese police said yesterday that their own review team had been working since March 2011 to reassess files from the original investigation and this process had uncovered new leads. A well-placed source told the Mail they could be ‘highly significant’.

Authorities have put a secrecy order on the new material, banning it from being made public, but Portuguese law states that unsolved cases can be reopened only when there is strong new evidence.

The fresh probe was authorised by Joana Marques Vidal, Portugal’s first female attorney general, who was not in the post when the original investigation was shelved.

Breakthrough? Police investigating the 
disappearance of Madeleine McCann received 150 calls from Holland after a
TV broadcast there

Metropolitan
Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley and Detective Chief Inspector
Andy Redwood, who is in charge of the Yard’s inquiry, met senior 
Portuguese police in Lisbon late last week to be briefed on the new  
lines of inquiry, which are said to be separate to those being followed 
by the Met. The McCanns were also briefed.

Mr Rowley said the meeting was ‘very positive’ and both forces had a ‘shared determination’ to solve the case.

Home
Secretary Theresa May welcomed the development, saying: ‘I hope what we
are going to see is a resolution of this case for the sake of Maddie’s 
parents and family.’

Earlier
this month Scotland Yard spoke of a possible breakthrough after it 
emerged that officers were analysing data from the phone records of 
people who were in Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished.

Wanted: E-fits of fair-haired men who may be 
Dutch or Scandinavian who were seen lurking near the apartment in Praia 
da Luz, Portugal, which Madeleine McCann was snatched from. Police 
launched an appeal on Dutch television last week after a BBC Crimewatch appeal. Detectives believe 
the two efits could be the same person

Prime suspect: These e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 
yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal

Officers said they had identified 41 ‘persons of interest’, including several British people, who were in Portugal at the time.

They also released new e-fits, including images of a man seen near the McCanns’ holiday flat carrying a girl in pyjamas.

Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said this week that his force now has the ‘best chance’ of solving the mystery.

Sir
Bernard’s detectives believe Madeleine, who would now be ten, was 
abducted a few minutes before her mother raised the alarm at 10pm on May
3, 2007.

Disappearance: The Ocean Club resort in Praia Da Luz where Madeleine McCann disappeared from in May 2007

Probe: Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood in the Scotland Yard incident room where British officers are launching their own search for Madeleine

As revealed by the Mail this month, detectives are also investigating whether she was snatched after disturbing burglars.

In
the same week a year before Madeleine was abducted, a thief tried to 
burgle another apartment in the same resort but fled empty-handed after a
toddler screamed.

And 
in the three months leading up to her disappearance, there was a 
four-fold increase in ‘low-level’ burglaries at the complex.

Response: After the couple's appeal on BBC Crimewatch(pictured), a number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine

New timeline: The Crimewatch special revealed that police were now looking at Madeleine's abduction as being at 10pm and not 9.15pm
