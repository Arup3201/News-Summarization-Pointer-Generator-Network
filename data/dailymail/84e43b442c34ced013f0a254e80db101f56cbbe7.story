The 43-year-old victim of a Los Angeles car crash caused by actress Salma Hayek's younger brother Sami has been identified as photographer Ian Cuttler Sala of New York.

The Grammy-Award winning art director was in the passenger seat of the 2006 Ford GT on Sunday when 40-year-old Hayek lost control of the sports car, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided head-on with a pick-up truck.

Sala died at the scene while Hayek was taken to UCLA Medical Center for several broken ribs and facial lacerations.

Expensive taste: The sports car Hayek was driving is worth an estimated $165,000

Not in control: A spokesman for the LAPD said Hayek may not have been familiar with how to drive the Ford GT

The driver of the truck, 20-year-old Alvin Javier Gomez was also hospitalized for a broken foot and body pains.

After the accident, Gomez tweeted: 'Only reason I'm alive right now is only because God himself gave me a second chance...Rest in Peace.'

Gomez's family told ABC 13 that he is recovering at home in San Diego.

Investigators are still trying to figure out what caused Hayek to lose control of his vehicle, but a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman says Hayek may have been unfamiliar with the vehicle.

'Too much speed on a curved roadway, tried to over-correct and unfortunately crossed into opposing lanes,' Sgt Stephanie Krajchir told KTLA.

The sports car Hayek was driving is worth approximately $165,000 according to Kelley Blue Book, and can reach speeds of up to 205 mph.

Witness Syed Abrar says accidents are normal on this particular curve of Sunset Boulevard.

Two hours after a KTLA news crew arrived on the scene, two more accidents happened - though no one seemed to be seriously hurt in either.

The investigation is ongoing and no charges has been filed yet.

According to Sala's website, he worked at Sony Music NY for nine years before becoming a photographer.

At Sony he created visual campaigns for musicians like Beyonce, Billy Joel and Mariah Carey.

As a photographer he has shot advertisements for Converse, Gillette and Lincoln Center as well as editorials for several magazines.

He earned his Grammy Award designing the packaging for 'Johnny Cash: The Legend' box set.

Sami and older sister Salma were born to parents Diana Jimenez Medina, an opera singer and talent scout, and Sami Hayek Dominguez, a businessman who once ran for mayor of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico.

Hayek currently runs his own design studio in Los Angeles, but originally started off studying business administration at Pepperdine.

While studying abroad at the University's Florence campus one year, he had a sudden change of heart.

'I stood up, turned my test in, walked to a phone booth woke my dad up and said, I'm out,' Hayek told People.

He told his father he was going to be a painter, sculptor or architect, to which is father responded: 'Your head is not right.'

But his jump into the creative field paid off, and he has since designed furniture for the likes of Brad Pitt.

He is married to jewelry-designer Daniela Villegas and the two live in a home in the Hollywood Hills.
