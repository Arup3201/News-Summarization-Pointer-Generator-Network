Arsenal players were pictured doing sprint training as they prepared for Saturday's Emirates Cup.

Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey were put through their paces while wearing the contraption that consisted of a harness and ropes.

The FA Cup holders are currently training in Austria but will return to England later this week to complete their pre-season before facing Manchester City in the Community Shield.

The Emirates Cup is an annual pre-season tournament hosted by Arsene Wenger's side, involving three other teams.

This year Arsenal will be joined by Monaco, Benfica and Valencia, although they will only play the first two.

Recent signing Calum Chambers was also present during the training session. Chambers will fight Mathieu Debuchy for a starting berth at right-back following the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City.
