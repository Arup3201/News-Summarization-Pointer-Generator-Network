A tourist had to be rescued from one of Scotland's highest mountains after attempting to climb the peak wearing flip-flops.

The walker and two friends were exploring 4,006ft Aonach Mor in Lochaber near Fort William to "see the snow" when he slipped and hurt his ankle on Wednesday night.

A team from Lochaber Mountain Rescue were called out and said they were "amazed" to see the casualty's choice of footwear.

Painful lesson: The unnamed tourist, pictured left, had to be stretchered off the mountain by rescuers

They reported that one of the injured man's companions was bare-foot when they saw him and the other was wearing trainers.

Members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue 
stretchered the injured man to the mountain's gondola lift and then on 
to a waiting ambulance which took him to the Belford Hospital at Fort 
William. His condition is unknown.

It is understood the trio had taken the gondola up the mountain - a sister peak of the UK's highest mountain, Ben Nevis - on Wednesday and then walked to the Goose area 
which still has pockets of snow.

Rescue team leader John Stevenson said: 'We
 found them 20 minutes from the top of the gondola - which the staff 
especially kept open for us to get up. The were on the grass. We don't 
know if they actually had reached the snow or were on their way back 
from it. There is still plenty of deep snow on the hill.

'But
 they said they wanted to stand on snow in Scotland. We don't know if 
they actually did. The grass was wet enough to have an accident - 
especially in flip-flops.'

Big draw: The group were exploring 4,006ft Aonach Mor in Lochaber near Fort William to "see the snow"

Mr Stevenson said his team were amazed at the group's choice of footwear: 'People really need to wear the right shoes. It is still wet in places on the hill and ironically the chap who had bare feet was probably better off than his companions'

'One of our team members, John Macrae, actually 
hurled one of the flips-flops and told the guy 'that's how much use they
 are on the hill!

'He went and got it back for him but the bloke got the message. We believe they were from abroad and were tourists.

'I 
know in some countries they wear flip-flops to climb hills but we told 
them next time they come back to Scotland to stand on snow wear 
something more appropriate - like a good pair of boots.

'They said they were sorry for 'all the fuss.''

Despite the onset of summer, a snow warning was issued to climbers and walkers on neighbouring Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain, and other Scottish mountains only two weeks ago.

But the Mountaineering Council of Scotland warned that 'winter is still lingering on the roof of Scotland.'

Heather Morning, the Mountain Safety Advisor with the 12,000-strong MCoS, advised those heading to climb 4409-ft Ben Nevis to be aware of the late lying snow beds and "be cautious."

'Walking on snow in summer can really add to your day out on the hill and be a lot of fun if the snow is relatively flat. However, be warned: if you take a slip and start to slide - is there a chance that slide could take you over the edge?' she said.

'There are still large cornices - ledges of snow hanging over the edge of the cliff face - on Ben Nevis and many other Scottish Munros (mountains over 3000 ft).

'Care should be taken to avoid these and stay on the rocky terrain - particularly in misty conditions when it might be difficult to see the edge.'

Ms Morning added that a particular risk was in the underfoot conditions. The Scottish mountains hold snow long into the spring and early summer. These snow patches will often be hard and located high up on the shady, north side of the mountain.

Hill walkers are advised to treat these old snow patches with caution, particularly if the 'run out' below is over steep ground.

Carey Davies, the British Mountaineering Council's hill walking officer, said: 'When spring arrives a lot of people feel the pull of the mountains and want to get outdoors again. But sometimes people get caught out at this time of year. While it may feel like spring has sprung at low levels, up on the mountain tops it can be a very different story.

'If you're going into the hills remember you may encounter the white stuff - anything from the odd patch to large areas. So be prepared!'
