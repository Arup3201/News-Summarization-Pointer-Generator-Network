New rules: Jeremy Hunt will set out rules that prevent hospitals from imposing huge fines for trivial infringements 

Hospitals must offer free or cut-price parking to the seriously ill, the Health Secretary will announce today.

Setting out strict new rules, Jeremy Hunt will say cowboy parking operators can no longer be allowed to impose huge fines for trivial infringements.

His intervention is a major victory for the Daily Mail’s campaign to protect vulnerable patients. 

The outrageous behaviour of some parking bullies has sparked a mass of complaints. 

Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatment has over-run are among those who have been ripped off.

‘Patients and families shouldn’t have to deal with the added stress of unfair parking charges,’ Mr Hunt will say.

‘These clear ground rules set out our expectations, and will help the public hold the NHS to account for unfair charges or practices.’

The guidance to health trusts makes clear they will be responsible for the actions of the private firms that run more than three quarters of hospital car parks.

They will have to act against rogue contractors and not sign contracts ‘on any basis that incentivises fines’.

The guidance says hospitals should offer free or reduced cost parking to the relatives of all patients considered to be gravely ill.

Concessions should also be offered to the disabled and to people needing frequent outpatient appointments, such as those receiving chemotherapy.

Nurses, doctors and other staff working shifts and unable to use public transport should also be offered discounted rates.

Discretion must be used to ensure patients are not issued with swingeing fines if their appointment over-runs.

Hospitals will be urged to axe camera networks that fine drivers even if they are just a few seconds late.

They will be told to install pay-on-exit systems that charge for the precise time.

Operators will be forced to publish details of their charges and penalties prominently.

A Whitehall source said Mr Hunt was concerned that many patients were being tricked by unscrupulous operators.

The package of measures was broadly welcomed by campaigners last night, although they warned Mr Hunt must ensure the guidance is followed.

Duleep Allirajah, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Hospitals must not ignore this government guidance and should commit to implementing the guidelines as a matter of urgency so that cancer patients do not continue to pay unfair hospital parking charges.

‘Cancer patients receiving vital treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy will often need to make frequent trips to hospital and unaffordable charges are leaving many out of pocket.’

Anna Bradley, of Healthwatch England, said complaints about parking charges were by far the most common concern raised by patients and their families. 

She added: ‘The new rules will hopefully offer much-needed support for those that have to visit hospitals regularly, either for treatment or in support of a loved one receiving care.

‘The key will be making sure the public are aware of the changes so that they can challenge the system when they feel they are facing unfair charges.’

Hospitals should ensure charges are ‘reasonable for the area’ and rates are clearly displayed, along with details of penalties.

Free or reduced parking should be offered to the relatives of the ‘gravely ill’, the disabled, patients needing regular appointments and staff working antisocial shifts.

Fines should only be imposed ‘where reasonable’ and should be waived when a patient has had to stay for reasons beyond their control, such as late-running treatment.

Hospitals should consider phasing out CCTV-based parking systems that allow operators to levy penalties on people who overstay by even a few seconds. Instead they should shift to pay-on-exit.

Hospitals are to be made responsible for the actions of private parking operators and are urged to ‘act against rogue contractors’.

Health sources acknowledge that the guidance is not mandatory. But they believe making hospitals responsible for their car parks will shame them into forcing private operators to clean up their act. 

Last month, the Daily Mail highlighted claims by whistle-blower Tony Taylor, who says he was ordered to focus on cancer wards because patients were often late returning to their cars after gruelling treatment.

Mr Taylor says he was ordered to ‘give tickets, no matter what, regardless of any illness’. Wardens were offered bonuses to give cancer wards ‘a good banging’.

Some parking firms were also accused of using bully-boy tactics to intimidate people into paying outrageous fines.

Victims say they are handed parking tickets that look almost identical to official local authority tickets, even though they do not carry the same legal force. 

These supposed penalty notices are then followed up by menacing letters warning drivers to pay up or face prosecution.

The majority of hospitals have handed control of their car parks to private firms.

Often, no payment is involved when the contracts are signed. Instead, the hospital will take the parking revenue, leaving the private firm to fund its operations and make a profit from any fines it can levy for infringements.

Ricky Gater, of the Parking Ticket Appeals Service, said: ‘The incentive for these companies is not to make sure people come on time and park correctly, the incentive is to earn money.’
