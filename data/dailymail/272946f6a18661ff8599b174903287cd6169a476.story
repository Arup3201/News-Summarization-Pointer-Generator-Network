Clinton Morrison is in talks over a possible move to Carlisle United.

The 35-year-old free agent has been training with basement club Hartlepool but after manager Colin Cooper resigned at the weekend, Morrison is weighing up a switch to fellow strugglers Carlisle.

The  striker is a free agent after leaving Colchester United in the summer and Carlisle manager Keith Curle is keen to bolster his scoring options.

Morrison scored over 100 goals for Crystal Palace over two separate spells with the club, while also playing for Birmingham, Coventry and Sheffield Wednesday.

Carlisle are currently second from bottom of League Two after gaining just nine points from 11 games.

The Cumbrians have averaged around a goal per game this season, but with them conceding considerably more that that they could do with boosting their attack.
