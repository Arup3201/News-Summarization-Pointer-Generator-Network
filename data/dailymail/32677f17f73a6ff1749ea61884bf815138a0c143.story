Survival expert and television presenter Ray Mears has broken a three-year silence to speak about the role he played in the hunt for gunman Raoul Moat.

The bush tracker has revealed how he managed to get within 20ft of the former doorman after eight hours of moving stealthily though dense forest during the 'real life hunt'.

Mears joined a Tornado fighter jet and scores of armed police officers in the £1 million-plus search. They were called in after Moat and his accomplices went to ground in woodland surrounding Rothbury, Northumberland, in July 2010.

Mears, 49, became involved in the search after he contacted a police search adviser he had met at a lecture years earlier to offer his skills.

Police then asked for his help after an abandoned campsite on the outskirts of Rothbury, was discovered.

In an interview with the Gloucestershire Echo, Mears said he got within 20ft of Moat after eight hours of moving stealthily through dense forest.

He described the scene when he arrived in Rothbury as like something 'out of a Hollywood film set' with bright lights, police snipers, helicopters circling overhead and the Tornado making reconnaissance sorties.

He told the newspaper: 'It was all a bit surreal.

'This is the first time I've talked about it and it's because I feel there has been sufficient water under the bridge.'

Mears, who was speaking ahead of the publication of his autobiography later this month, told the newspaper that police disclosed
afterwards that Moat's emergence from hiding was a direct result of his
presence with armed officers.

'It was a real-life hunt; within my skill set but outside of my comfort zone'

He said: 'It was such a unique set of circumstances. I have experience of tracking for 40 years.

'I can't imagine there would be that many people in the country who would have been in a position to help the police find someone who had gone into hiding who needed to be found.

'It was a real-life hunt; within my skill set but outside of my comfort zone.'

Mears’ involvement in the Raoul Moat case was known at the time, but today was the first time he had spoken about it.

Moat shot unarmed PC David Rathband in the face, leaving him blind

He was taken to a camp used by the 
steroid-enhanced bodybuilder and, from there, led detectives on an 
eight-hour trail through dense forest before he discovered Moat in 
woodland near the village of Rothbury in Northumberland.

Moat went on the run after shooting Chris Brown, 29, who had started a relationship with his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart.

The spurned lover killed Mr Brown and seriously injured Ms Stobbart in the shooting in Birtley, Gateshead, two days after he was released from prison.

The following day the 37-year-old bodybuilder shot unarmed PC David Rathband in the face, leaving him blind.

The officer was found hanged at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, in February last year.

The huge search for Moat, involving officers from 18 forces, was one of the biggest police operations seen in the UK.

The rapidly evolving manhunt gripped the nation as newspapers, television and radio stations concentrated on the search, bringing close scrutiny of the police's actions.

The 17-stone steroid addict was finally cornered at the edge of the River Coquet on the evening of July 9.

Following a five-hour stand-off with armed police the father-of-three shot himself in the head at the moment officers deployed Tasers to try to disable him.

Moat was declared dead in the early hours of the following day.
