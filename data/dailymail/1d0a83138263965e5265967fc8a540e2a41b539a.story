Caught out: Decio Lourenco, 24, is facing prosecution

A skateboarder is facing arrest over a video posted on YouTube showed him careering down a busy road at 68 mph - fast enough to set off a speed camera

Decio Lourenco, 24, is facing prosecution as the South African city's safety authorities say he could have caused a 
major crash on the mountain road.

Mr Lourenco's video, filmed at sunset on January 20,  saw him race down Kloof Nek 
Road between Table Mountain and Lion's Head, in Cape Town.

Motorists on the opposite side have their headlights on as he hurtles down  the mountain road in fading light.

It was filmed by friend and fellow skater André Roux, using a camera attached to his car bumper.

Despite safety concerns, Mr Lourenco, a graphic design student insists that he took all possible 
precautions wearing a helmet and gloves.

He says that he specifically picked a quiet time of day, but he still weaves dangerously across the road as cars drive past.

Jean-Pierre Smith, Cape Town's safety and security spokesman, is pushing for a punishment saying he had put other road users at risk.

'All that was needed was for one of those motorists to panic and swerve 
into the oncoming traffic and you have a large number of deaths, as we 
have already had on that road,' he said according to The  Daily Telegraph.

He said he had asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to charge Mr Lourenco with reckless and negligent road behaviour.

'If we don't take action against him, every other aspirant skateboarder 
will try it and one of them will come to a sticky end,' he said.

Mr Roux said that Mr Lourenco has been skating for years, and has been placed in poll positions in numerous downhill races since he was 16.

But it appears that despite the threat of prosecution, Mr Lourenco does not regret his action and said he had spent the day with a big smile on his face.

'I’ve been skating down hills from a young age… often going much faster than that,' he told Iol news.

'This is the first time I’ve gotten any attention for it.' 

In Cape Town it is illegal to speed on the roads regardless of the mode of transport – whether it was a car, bicycle or skateboard.

Last year, a Joburg longboarder was killed after he smashed into a truck on the Franschhoek Pass.
