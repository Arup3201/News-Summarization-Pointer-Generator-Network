Jane Fonda has opened up about reading the medical records of her mother and discovering that she had nine abortions before Jane was even born.

In a speech at a fundraising event for a rape victims' charity, the 76-year-old Hollywood icon told the audience that her tragic mother Frances was sexually abused from the age of eight, an experience that Jane believes led to her promiscuous and self-destructive behavior.

'The minute that I read that, everything fell into place,' she said. 'I knew [the reason for] the promiscuity, the endless plastic surgery, the guilt, the inability to love or be intimate, and I was able to forgive her and forgive myself.'

Heartbreaking revelation: Jane Fonda has opened up about reading the medical records of her mother Frances and discovering that she had nine abortions before Jane was even born

Frances, who was 29 when she gave birth to Jane, killed herself on her 42nd birthday, which friends say was the single most formative event in Jane's multi-faceted life.

Jane told audience members that she suspects her mother was sexually abused by a piano tuner as a young girl, which left her traumatized for the rest of her life.

Shortly after Jane's younger brother Peter was born, Frances was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Discovering that her husband was cheating on her with other women, Frances went to desperate lengths to regain his attention. She would walk around naked in front of him and even crawl on her hands and knees to him, begging him to talk to her. It didn't work.

In 1950, on her 42nd birthday Frances committed suicide by slicing her throat with a razor during a stay at Craig House, a sanitarium in Beacon, New York. Jane was 12.

Tempestuous: Jane's father Henry (left) was cold and a bully, not to mention a shameless womanizer, but Jane always blamed the alarming behavior of her mother for the break-up of her parents' marriage - until she learned of Frances' abuse

Jane's father Henry was cold and a bully, not to mention a shameless womanizer, but - too young to understand mental illness - his daughter always blamed the alarming behavior of her manic depressive mother for the break-up of her parents' marriage - until she learned of Frances' abuse.

The fitness queen, who is a longtime pro-choice activist, believes she has been drawn to helping sexually abused girls because she somehow knew what had befallen her mother.

She said at the event that sexual violence is 'epidemic', vowing: 'I will support the Rape Treatment Center for the rest of my life.'

Jane has written on her blog that she forgave her mother for their fractious relationship after discovering she was sexually abused, realizing that her behavior was not her fault.

'Twenty years later she could have found the help she needed in the specific form of therapy that arose out of The Women’s Liberation Movement in the 1970s,' she wrote last October.

'I sometimes cry when I think of how my mother could have been saved.'
