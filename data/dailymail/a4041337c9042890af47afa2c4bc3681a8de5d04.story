Drivers who complain about potholes in the road may now count themselves lucky after a driver had a narrow escape when the road erupted in front of him.

Like a scene out of a Hollywood disaster movie, the road rose into the air in front of an SUV driver who was speeding up to a red light.

The video, shot in Yekaterinburg, Sverdlovskaya Oblast, Russia, has been viewed more than 40,000 times online.

A car which appeared to be speeding towards the red light crashes into the erupting road

A dashboard camera caught the moment the road surface was shot into the air by the explosion.

The video, dated Thursday, shows the car slowing down for a red light when the SUV driver overtakes on the outside, only for the van to crash into the road rubble.

It erupts into three large pieces, sending a cloud of dust into the air.

A second car only missed it by moments when the driver turned right barely seconds earlier. 

The car is tipped sideways on impact but the driver was able to walk away from the crash

Experts who have seen the footage believe it was caused by an exploding gas main.

Howard Robinson, chief executive of the Road Surface Treatments Association, who has seen the video, said: 'It looks like a gas main has exploded. If it was a water main we would see water gushing upwards.'

In the clip the clearly stunned SUV driver can be seen getting gingerly out of his car as the hazard lights flash.

Some have speculated online that the eruption was caused by a burst underground sewer or underground air pressure.

Others have joked the explosion was deliberately carried out to stop the driver running the red light.

One person posted on Live Leak: 'In Russia cops don't stop you for running a light, the road does'.

Another user wrote: 'Car driver wanted to run the red light, red light did stop him immediately.' 

However, other views have put forward an even more dramatic explanation.

One called Strymerx asked: 'Is this a new movie of Godzilla?'
