Faultless: World number one Novak Djokovic shows off his torso, delighting fans in Buckinghamshire

It was more strip poker than tennis - but the ladies at Boodles were certainly not complaining as Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov compared torsos in a Wimbledon warm-up match yesterday.

World number one Djokovic interrupted proceedings between games, getting the crowd to slow-clap him as he removed his top, swinging it above his head and flexing his muscles.

And his ambitious young contender duly hit back with a fine return, stripping and throwing his top into the crowd.

Dimitrov, the 22-year-old boyfriend of Maria Sharapova, is fast becoming better known for his looks than his ability with a racket, making headlines for showing off his body during a previous match just three days ago.

The brief moment of light entertainment came during a match at the Boodles tennis competition in Buckinghamshire yesterday afternoon.

After Djokovic, 26, beat his opponent 5-7, 6-3, 10-6, he proceeded to taunt him by making fun of his girlfriend.

Prompted to treat the crowd with his notorious impression of Sharapova, Djokovic shouted out: 'I haven't done my Maria impression for a while now, but I think Grigor is probably better at it than me now.'

Dimitrov took the goading well and agreed to compare Sharapova acts for the crowd, saying: 'I'll do the walking' as Djokovic replied: 'I'll do the serve.'

Bulgarian Dimitrov, who stands at 6ft 
2in tall and is ranked 31st in the world, proceeded to skip and storm 
across the field with his head down, causing fans to erupt into cheers 
and laughter.

But the larger applause came for Djokovic, who pranced around the court before sticking out his bottom and pretending to tuck long hair behind his ears, steadying himself to serve.

He then threw the ball in the air and hit it, grunting like a wild animal. 'It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a sports match,' said John, 30, who was in the audience.Â 

'He is such an entertainer. He was flicking his hair and grunting really loudly. It was like When Harry Met Sally. Dimitrov took it well and joined in. I'd love to know what Sharapova thought.'

Earlier Djokovic removed his top before pointing dramatically to his opponent so he could do the same.

The fan added: 'The crowd went wild. It 
was full of middle class women - the Range Rover brigade - but they 
loved it and got out their cameras to take pictures.

'At first Dimitrov wouldn't take his top
off because he didn't have another one with him. But a ball girl got 
him one and he took his other one off and threw it into the crowd.'

Djokovic also performed an impression of a ball girl for the crowd before having a rally with a five-year-old on a neighbouring court.

The world's top player has form for stripping for the crowd. After beating Andy Murray in the final of the Australian Open in January he celebrated by dramatically ripping off his shirt.

Dimitrov, meanwhile, has been proudly showing off his gorgeous Russian girlfriend.

Love all: Dimitrov proved popular with members of a ladies' tennis club in Buckinghamshire earlier this week

They were spotted cannoodling in Madrid last month and at The Queen's Club in west London last week, Sharapova cheered him on as he competed in the Aegon championship.

'I haven't done my Maria impression for a while now, but I think Grigor is probably better at it than me now'

Novak Djokovic

After yesterday's match, Djokovic said: 'Everything is going according to plan and hopefully I can get in the best possible shape for the start of Wimbledon.

'There's no bigger motivation than playing in the most prestigious tournament in the world in our sport, the one that I always dreamed of winning. I won it two years ago and it's definitely been the highlight of my career. I love playing at Wimbledon.'

Dimitrov added: 'It's a great feeling to play against him. Especially today. I hope we had an entertaining match but at the same time a very positive match.'
