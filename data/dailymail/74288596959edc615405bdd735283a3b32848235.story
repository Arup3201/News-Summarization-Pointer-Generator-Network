Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in hot water after he said Australia was unsettled before British colonisation.

Mr Abbott made the comments during an address he made at the Melbourne Institute, saying Australia was unimaginable without foreign investment.

'I guess our country owes its existence to a form of foreign investment by the British government in the then unsettled or, um, scarcely settled, Great South Land,' he said on Friday.

But Australia's first female Aboriginal federal parliamentarian Senator Nova Peris said the comments hindered efforts to have her people recognised in the constitution.

The comments were hurtful, dismissive of indigenous Australians and incorrect, she said.

In a statement to the ABC, Ms Peris said: 'British settlement was not a foreign investment. It was invasion.'

'The comments from the Prime Minister have not just offended Aboriginal Australians but many people around the country.'

Northern Territory Senator Nova Peris said the comments made by Mr Abbott on Friday were offensive

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has also hit out at the prime minister for his comments.

He said Mr Abbott's remark was offensive, especially from a prime minister who claimed to be dedicated to indigenous affairs.

Mr Abbott's key indigenous adviser, Warren Mundine, labelled the comments silly and bizarre.
