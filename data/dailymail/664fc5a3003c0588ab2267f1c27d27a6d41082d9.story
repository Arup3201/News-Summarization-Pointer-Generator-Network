A burglar who broke into a California home got to enjoy a good night's sleep before the owners did.

Jacob and Melinda Mandell signed a lease for their new Mountain View home last Sunday, leaving a few boxes of belongings while they waiting to move in.

On Tuesday they received a call from the owner of the property. A contractor found the house had been broken into through the back door and an intruder had slept in the Mandells' bedroom.

'We came in and this was the bedroom where he was sleeping,' Jacob told NBC. 'He had taken the sleeping bag and sleeping pad out of the closet.'

Police say the intruder broke in some time after 3:00 p.m. Monday, spending the night and leaving before contractors appeared the next day at noon. 

The couple found out the thief had been through a few boxes, taking a coat, ski pants and two sleeping-bag straps, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

Police advised the Mandells to buy a security camera, and the next night they recorded footage of him trying to sneak in again.

A man in a light colored hoodie enters through a gate and pauses outside the doorway for a moment. 

B&E: The thief carries a handful of objects as he attempts to break into the home the night after the couple discovered he had taken a sleeping bag out of the closet

Denied: The perp walks out again after being unable to get into the home thanks to a repaired interior door 

Unsolved: Police say the suspect was seen in a white hoodie and is a Latino man about 5'8", 150 pounds and in his mid-twenties

He pauses at the screen door, possibly noticing the camera, before he tries to enter the house.

This time, a repaired rear door prevented the thief from entering.

Their landlord told NBC this was the first break in he had seen at the home for the 35 years he's owned it. 

'I feel sorry for my tenants. No one likes to be invaded like that,' he said.
