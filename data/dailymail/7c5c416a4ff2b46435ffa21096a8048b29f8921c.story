A paroled killer who chained mentally disabled adults in squalid basement dungeons forcing some into prostitution all for their disability checks has been charged with federal hate crimes and murder according to prosecutors.

Linda Weston, 52, accused of locking six disabled adults and four children like 'zoo animals' in Philadelphia over a 10-year-period was additionally indicted on Wednesday with federal charges including kidnapping and forced human labor.

Weston, the accused ringleader of the 
violent scheme, is the first person to be charged under a 2009 federal 
hate crimes statute that increases punishments for criminals who target 
the mentally disabled, authorities said.

Prosecutors say they may now seek the 
death penalty after the deaths of two of her alleged victims through 
prolonged abuse and neglect.

Dungeon: It was in this former boiler room in October of 2011 that police discovered four mentally disabled adults chained to the walls and one to the center heater

Abuse: The rescued victims described their shocking abuse living a life in squalor while a few were additionally forced into prostitution

'Shocking does not begin to describe the 
criminal allegations in this case, where victims were tied up and 
confined like zoo animals and treated like property akin to slaves,' 
U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger said.

The case came to light in October 2011 after a landlord discovered four malnourished victims locked in the 13-by-7 foot pitch-black room in the basement of a Philadelphia apartment building. One of them was chained to a boiler.

Authorities soon began untangling a complicated web of relationships among victims and their alleged captors in an investigation that spanned several states.

Weston has been jailed since then and pleaded not guilty to related state charges.

Her lawyer, George Yacoubian, said on 
Wednesday that federal prosecutors had 'over-reached for effect' with 
the new charges and that Weston maintains her innocence.

The
150-page grand jury indictment describes Weston as the ringleader of a 
'family' that included her daughter and three men who prosecutors say 
helped control and subjugate the victims.

Survivors: Three of the four victims spoke out after the horrifying ordeal last October

Weston used 'cunning, trickery, force and coercion' to get mentally disabled people to designate her as their caretaker, allowing her to illegally collect about $212,000 in Social Security payments over 10 years, Memeger said.

In all, authorities allege six disabled adults and four children were held captive in 'subhuman' conditions in basements, attics and closets at various times between 2001 and 2011. The victims were often drugged, deprived of food and medical care, and forced to use buckets for bathrooms, officials said.

The victims' diminished mental capacity, coupled with the fact that Weston continually moved the family to elude law enforcement, meant that 'escape for these individuals seemed impossible,' Memeger said.

Weston forced two female victims into 
prostitution, including her niece, to earn more money for the family 
when they lived in Texas and Florida, authorities said.

Two
other women died while living with Weston, leading to murder charges 
that make her eligible for the death penalty. Memeger said prosecutors 
are weighing whether to pursue it.

Maxine
Lee, a disabled Philadelphia woman, died of meningitis and starvation 
while living with Weston in Virginia in 2008, authorities said.

Others: Thomas Gregory, 47, (left) and Eddie Wright, 49, (right) are 
also accused of stealing the victims' Social Security checks

Family: Beatrice Weston's cousin Jean McIntosh allegedly taunted her through the cupboard door she was locked in

Another woman identified in court papers as D.S. died in Philadelphia in 2005 after prosecutors said Weston fed her drug-laced food while keeping her captive in a laundry room. Weston staged the death to look like an overdose, authorities said.

Weston already has served time for the starvation death of a man she locked in her Philadelphia apartment nearly three decades ago.

Others charged in the indictment unsealed Wednesday are Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, 33, of Philadelphia; Gregory Thomas Sr., 49, of Philadelphia; Eddie Wright, 52, of Killeen, Texas; and Nicklaus Woodard, 26, of West Palm Beach, Fla.

McIntosh, Thomas and Wright had already been named as co-defendants in the state case against Weston. Jury selection for that trial was scheduled to start Monday, but the Philadelphia district attorney's office said it will withdraw all charges in light of the federal indictment.

Woodard is a new defendant in the case who Memeger said was arrested in Florida on Wednesday morning. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer.

In August Weston's 20-year-old niece who was beaten and held captive in a cupboard for a decade allegedly by Weston filed suit against the city of Philadelphia for failing to prevent the horrifying ordeal.

Beatrice Weston claims the city failed to properly train its care workers, resulting in her being placed in her aunt's custody.

Weston was allegedly beaten with a baseball bat, forced to consume her own urine, held in a tiny closet and prostituted in the 10 years she was in the custody of Weston.

Beatrice Weston's complaint says the city of Philadelphia failed to release information about the aunt's criminal history in 2002, after her mother said she could not care for her.

Workers failed to carry out home investigations or arrange for health evaluations of Beatrice, according to the lawsuit, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

It also names two other defendants, Nefertiti Savoy, a former social worker with the Department of Human Services, and Richard Ames, an attorney who recommended Weston be given to her aunt.

'Beatrice Weston was forcibly prostituted by Linda Ann Weston and was regularly beaten, starved, and denied medical and dental care, as well as schooling,' the lawsuit states.

'During these 10 years, the City of Philadelphia received numerous complaints that Linda Ann Weston was holding children captive in her basement.'

The suit seeks damages for her anguish, payment for her medical and therapy expenses, and compensation for loss of past and future earnings, the Inquirer reported.

'Jurors are going to have to fix a value on every day, every month, every year that she was imprisoned,' her attorney Shanin Specter said. 'There's no amount of money that's fair.'

She added that her cousin taunted her, saying through the door: 'Don't you wish that you was out of that closet taking a hot shower like me?'

When she was found, police noted she had pellet gun wounds and burn marks, suggesting she was scolded with a hot spoon.

'She is in very, very poor condition,' Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Ray Evers said at the time. 'She has lost a lot of weight. She has newer injuries, definitely some older injuries, a lot of scarring.'
