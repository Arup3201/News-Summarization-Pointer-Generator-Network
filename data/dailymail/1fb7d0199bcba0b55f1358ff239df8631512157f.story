Zlatan Ibrahimovic has switched his attention from club football with Paris Saint-Germain to the international game with Sweden - just three days after netting a hat-trick in Ligue 1.

The PSG striker scored three times as the Ligue 1 champions crushed Saint Etienne 5-0 at the Parc des Princes on Sunday - taking his tally for the season to seven goals from just three matches.

And the 32-year-old looked in prime condition as he trained with the Sweden squad ahead of their friendly match with Estonia on Thursday.
