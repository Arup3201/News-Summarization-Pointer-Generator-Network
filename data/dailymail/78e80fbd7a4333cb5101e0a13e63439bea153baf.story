A pair of Subway workers compiled an Instagram album of revolting antics at work including freezing their urine and one employee rubbing his genitals on a baguette.

Cameron Boggs and Ian Jett were both employees at the fast food chain in Columbus, Ohio.

Following the photos being published online by news websites, the pair have now both been fired from the submarine sandwich store.

Horrifying: A pair of Subway workers compiled an Instagram album of revolting antics at work including one employee rubbing his genitals on a baguette

Cameron  Boggs posted a photo on Instagram next to the caption 'today at work I froze my pee' in a water bottle. Some of the other photos show the signature bread being shaped into the shape of a manhood

Boggs posted a photo on Instagram next to the caption 'today at work I froze my pee' in a water bottle.

The image showed a bottle which had a yellow substance in that he described as urine - it is unclear if the photo was taken in a Subway restaurant.

Boggs also posted a photo which shows a man rubbing his genitals on a baguette.

Under the username 'weedpriest' the caption read: 'My name is @ianjett and I will be your sandwich artist today.'

In a statement Subway said: 'This isolated incident is not representative of SUBWAY Sandwich Artists¿. These actions are not tolerated and the franchisee took immediate action to terminate the two employees involved'

The photo was later deleted.

Some of the other photos show the signature bread being shaped into the shape of genitals.

'I would never do that at work -- it was at home,' he said. 'This isn't something I'd ever do at Subway. It was totally a joke'

Subway employee Ian Jett

Ian Jett admitted to HuffPost Weird News that he had posed with the baguette, but denied he had taken the photo in a Subway store.

'I would never do that at work -- it was at home,' he said. 'This isn't something I'd ever do at Subway. It was totally a joke.'

In a statement Subway told Huffington Post: 'This isolated incident is not representative of SUBWAY Sandwich Artists™. These actions are not tolerated and the franchisee took immediate action to terminate the two employees involved.'

This is the second embarrassment for the chain this year -  three-year-old girl escaped with minor injuries after swallowing pieces of glass found inside a Subway sandwich in January. 

Aubrey Clark suffered cuts inside her mouth when she accidentally ate several glass fragments which were hidden inside her six-inch sandwich bought from a branch in Ontario, Canada.

Her mother Laura Clark was outraged with the fast-food chain, accusing Subway of ‘downplaying’ the incident, saying she has not had an apology from the multi-national company.

A spokesman for Subway's corporate office disputed her version of events, saying the company is investigating the incident and has been in touch with Ms Clark.
