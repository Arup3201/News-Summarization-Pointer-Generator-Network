Great Britain won two gold medals on the final day of the European Rowing Championships in Belgrade on Sunday.

The men's four crossed the line in a European best time of five minutes 46.86 seconds after the GB quartet comprised of Andrew Triggs Hodge, George Nash, Mohamed Sbihi and Alex Gregory led from start to finish.

Helen Glover and Polly Swann also claimed gold in the women's pair, beating second-placed Romania by seven seconds in a time of seven mins 3.62 secs.

Sailing away: The British contingent came home in a European best time of 5:46

Glover, who is also Olympic champion in this event, said: 'I think we got off to a normal start for us but the others probably went out harder than normal and paid a bit for it later.'

There were also silver medals for the men's quadruple scull, lightweight men's four and lightweight men's pair against world-rated opposition, while the women's eight also took a runners-up spot.
