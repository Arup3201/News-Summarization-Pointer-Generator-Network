Britain's dressage team trotted to a historic victory over Germany today, winning Team GB's 20th gold of the London Olympic Games.

And the medal success now means that Britain has surpassed its huge total haul from the Beijing Games four years ago.

With Team GB's athletes having broken the landmark number of gold medals in 2008, all eyes are now focused on the velodrome where the gold rush looks set to continue.

This afternoon, Carl Hester, Charlotte Dujardin and 
Laura Bechtolsheimer held on to their narrow lead over Germany to win 
gold at Greenwich Park in front of a home crowd of 20,000 spectators.

The success of Britain's athletes has
already passed the hopes and expectations of many in managing to match 
Britain's impressive medal-winning run in 2008.

And
with five full days of competition left, it seems certain that Team GB 
will beat its Beijing haul of 47 medals.

This year's Team GB is the most successful to represent the country since 1908, when comparatively few countries took part in sporting events.

In Britain's best-ever Olympics of 1908, the country claimed an unsurpassable 146 medals - 56 golds, 51 silvers and 39 bronze.

The medal-winning success also, in particular, represents an about-turn for Great Britain's dressage team since the 'dark days' recently referred to by Hester.

Team GB's dressage team competed at successive Olympic Games for many years without success, which makes their gold medal success to tip Team GB's 2012 team into the record books perhaps all the more impressive.

Team dressage has been dominated by Germany in every Games since 1984 - but the magic of London 2012 meant that this was yet another bastion to fall to an apparently unstoppable Team GB.

The three riders - who were on the verge of winning gold after enjoying a marginal points cushion ahead of their German rivals - managed to hold onto their top podium position in an impressive display this afternoon.

Carl Hester on Uthopia, Charlotte Dujardin on Valegro and Laura Bechtolsheimer on Mistral Hojris, managed an almost flawless display at the iconic Greenwich arena to bag the gold medals.

Charlotte Dujardin, who was the last of the British team to compete in the event this afternoon, has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the sport since competing in a grand prix in dressage for the first time in 2011.

And in a sport which has received relatively little publicity, the contrast in backgrounds between two of Team GB's riders make for a touching back story.

German-born Laura Bechtolsheimer, 27, 
who moved to Gloucestershire when she was one, is the granddaughter of 
German billionaire property magnate Karl-Heinz Kipp.

Her family own her horse Mistral Hojris, known as Alf, and her father Wilfried is a breeder and trainer.

Charlotte Dujardin, on the other hand, was born in Enfield, north London, and got her major break when she went to work on veteran British competitor Carl Hester's yard for 10 days in 2007 and was offered a full-time job as a rider.

The 27-year-old, now also based in Gloucestershire, left school at 16 and went to work for international dressage judge Judy Harvey for four years, before being employed by Hester.

She now trains clients including New Zealand legend Mark Todd.

Despite their contrasting personal backgrounds, Dujardin and Bechtolsheimer have already seen record-breaking success as part of the British team.

Led by Hester, and along with Emile Faurie, they won a gold medal at the European Championships last year, achieving the highest score in the competition's history.

To commemorate the fantastic win, he only post box on Channel Island Sark will be painted gold in honour of Olympian Carl Hester.

Hester, 45, left the island at the age of 16 to pursue his dream of an equestrian career but said he is 'very proud' of his birthplace.

He and team mates Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin, 27, today won gold - Britain's first ever Olympic medal in the dressage.

Hester, who now lives in Gloucestershire, said: 'I think that's really fantastic. I'm very proud of that place where I come from. I know those people are very excited to have an Olympian from the Channel Islands.'

He said people living on the island missed out on a visit from the Olympic torch as it went on a relay around Britain.

'They were very upset that the flame didn't go to Sark when it went around the countryside, it went to Guernsey instead. Well, if you come from Sark Guernsey's a dirty word. It didn't go to my island and I was the one coming here.

'So the fact that they now get a gold letterbox is just outstanding. I'm very delighted that they've recognised that and that's where I come from, so hooray.'

Cassandra Morris, from Guernsey Post, told the BBC the post box will be transformed in the next few days.

She said: 'This is the first time that Guernsey Post has changed the colour of Sark's post box since it was painted blue in 1980, 11 years after the company became independent from the British Post Office.

'The plans for transforming Sark's post box are well under way and Guernsey Post hopes to have the post box finished in just a few days.'

Those unfamiliar with the world of dressage would be forgiven for wondering exactly what was happening today at Greenwich Park.

It may not look as challenging as the imposing fences on a cross-country course or possess the theatrical element of showjumping, but dressage is a highly technical discipline which demands huge skill and precision from both horse and rider.

In the team event, the pair must ride two 'tests', with the rider memorising a series of movements that are performed in front of a set of judges.

These are designed to put the horses through their paces and include complex manoeuvres such as a pirouette - where the animal effectively turns a full circle, with its hind-quarters at the centre.

In other movements, the horse appears to 'skip' across the arena. The objective is for the combination to work calmly together with top marks going to the most elegant and accurate partnerships.

A mark out of 10 is awarded for each movement, with the total score shown as a percentage at the culmination of a test.

The results for the three riders in each team are then added together. A final score is determined by combining the marks for the two tests.

Dressage has been an Olympic sport since 1912. It was a discipline reserved for army officers until 1952 when it became a mixed event.

The last seven Olympic titles have been won by Germany.
