Poignant photographs of the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack on Nagasaki have been unearthed after lying hidden for seven decades.

The images were taken by one of Japan's top photographers the day after the explosion, but were then confiscated by the U.S. military in a bid to stop them being used as propaganda.

They show the devastated landscape of the formerly thriving city, with lines of refugees looking for shelter and the skeletons of hollowed-out buildings after the bombing, which killed 75,000 residents of Nagasaki.

The pictures were taken by Yosuke Yamahata, the only Japanese photographer to document the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack.

He was sent to the city on the morning of the raid on August 9, 1945, to capture photographs to be used for Japanese propaganda.

Many of his images became well-known symbols of the historic bombing - but others, taken on a faulty camera, have not been seen since.

They were found in a photo album which was confiscated by an American military policeman at the end of the Second World War, but whose significance was only recently discovered by a private owner.

An atomic bomb weighing more than 4,000kg was dropped on Nagasaki by parachute from an American B29 Bomber at 11.02 local time on August 9, 1945.

Nicknamed 'the Fat Man', it exploded 500m above ground and completely destroyed the city, on the Japanese island of Kyushu.

It was the second attack by the United States on a Japanese city in three days.

More than 3million leaflets had been dropped over the country from American aeroplanes warning  that atomic weapons would be used 'again and again' unless the war was ended.

The Japanese surrendered less than a week later on August 15.

Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000-166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000-80,000 in Nagasaki.

It is expected to fetch £20,000 when it goes up for auction at Bonhams in New York this week.

Tom Lamb, a historian from the auction house, said: 'These photographs come from an album that was put together by an American military policeman who had been sent to police Osaka after the end of World War II.

'The policeman assembled around 250 photographs in the album during his time in Japan and most of them detail his life as a military policeman and around the city.

'But among the photos are 24 that were taken by Yosuke Yamahata, a Japanese photographer whose images of the destruction to Nagasaki became known worldwide.

'The album contains some of Yamahata's most famous images but there are others in the set that have never been seen before.

'It is thought these photos come from a second, faulty camera that Yamahata had with him.

'These photographs started off life as propaganda against the Americans, who wanted very much to cover up what they had just done.

'Censorship was high and so the photos of the destruction were kept under shop counters and handed out surreptitiously.

'At some point it seems the military policeman confiscated the photos from a Japanese citizen in Osaka and put them in his album with no knowledge of their importance.

The dropping of the two atomic bombs was the most devastating action the world has ever seen.

'These photos serve as a reminder of the power we hold that keeps the peace. Today's nuclear bombs are 100 times that ferocity of those that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.'
