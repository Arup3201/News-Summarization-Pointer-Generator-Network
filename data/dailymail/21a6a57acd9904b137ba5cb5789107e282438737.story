At five tonnes, it was too heavy to flutter in the wind, but the world's largest flag was today unfurled in a Romanian airfield, breaking Guinness Records.

The flag, which measures 1,145 feet by 744 feet, was sewn with 44 miles of thread.

200 volunteers rolled the record-breaking flag out in Clinceni, near Bucharest to claim the title.
