Conman Peter Foster, who was dramatically arrested this week after a year on the run, was making millions of dollars running an online betting scheme from his Australian hideout, it has been revealed.

As Australian television viewers were being treated to vision of his dramatic arrest, it emerged he had been using a false name to operate the business with a male friend who was sharing a rented house with him near the New South Wales resort town of Byron Bay.

But Sports Trading Club has now taken its last bet with the arrest of Foster, who will be extradited across the border to Queensland to serve at least 18 months jail of a three year sentence imposed on him last year for contempt of court.

Peter Foster, 52, was arrested in Byron Bay on Tuesday afternoon (pictured here in 2007)

Foster appeared in a magistrate court earlier today charged with assaulting police and resisting arrest when police, tipped off by Channel Nine' s 'A Current Affair' television programme, jumped on him near the house he had been living in.

Magistrate Jeff Linden formally accepted Foster's guilty plea but did not punish him, noting that an outstanding arrest warrant allowed police to take the fugitive to a Brisbane prison to serve the outstanding prison sentence

The 52-year-old conman - who sparked the 'Cheriegate' in 2002 when he helped Cherie Blair purchase two flats in Bristol at a discounted price - was said by his solicitor outside the court to have been caring for his ill mother, Louise Foster, in Australia for the past 11 months.

Private detective Ken Gamble, who had been working with the television crew to track down Foster after many weeks of surveillance, said the conman and the other man (named in the programme as Peter Noble) had set up Sports Trading Club in such a way 'it was difficult to see who was operating it.'

 Mr Gamble said he was pleased that Foster had been caught 'because he has stolen the dreams of mums and dads of Australia.'

The arrest of the self-styled 'international man of mischief' made for compulsive viewing last night, with half a dozen detectives and uniformed police pouncing on Foster in a clump of bushes.

It was in September last year that the Federal Court in Brisbane found Foster guilty of contempt for disregarding a 2005 ban on him being involved in the weight loss industry.

The ban had been imposed after he conned A$6 million - about £3.5 million - from 90 investors in a nasal spray he claimed help people lose weight.

When he failed to turn up at the Federal Court in Brisbane, he was sentenced to three years in jail, with at least 18 months of that to be served behind bars. 

Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry

Foster's solicitor's comment has put into question a number of photographs he posted of himself in October last year - a week after he had been sentenced to three years jail for contempt of court - purporting to show that he was in the Pacific nation of Fiji.

The photographs showed him wearing a floral island-style shirt and lifting a coconut shell filled with kava.

Photos also purported to show him reading the current edition of the Fiji Times and sitting near a televison set which had the current news programme playing.

This morning solicitor Mr Fisher said outside the Tweed Heads magistrates court in northern New South Wales that Foster was still coming to terms with what he was facing.

'He's a it shell-shocked at the moment, but his main concern is that he gets reunited with his mother because he's been looking after his mother for the last 11 months. He's effectively been living like a monk.'

But a news crew from A Current Affair took their camera through the house that Foster had been renting under the false name of Mark Hughes and found television screens displaying the online betting club and a number of mobile phones.

In 2002 Cherie Blair, wife of of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the Australian conman

During his time in Britain, he befriended Carole Caplin, Cherie Blair's fitness 'guru' which is how he came to get close to the Blair family

Foster was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US

The photos convinced many people that they were too good to have been Photoshopped, but police who had been ordered to look for him following his failure to appear in court to hear the judge sentence him said they still believed he could be in Australia.

There was no record of him leaving the country legally through an airport or a sea port, but Foster claimed he had made his escape by wearing a wig and using a false passport. 

During a fierce struggle police were heard telling him to 'let go of the gun' - his solicitor saying later that Foster had not realised he had grabbed one of the officer's weapons.

'My client's stated he was just simply grabbing at it - it could have been a torch,' said Mr Fisher.

As he was being led to a police car, Foster was seen clutching at his chest and then dropping to his knees. Ambulance officers were called to check him over before his burly frame was lifted up onto a stretcher and he was taken to hospital for observation.

Today, when he appeared before magistrate Linden, Foster was still wearing a hospital gown.

But by the end of the week, the man who has boasted of being behind bars in the UK, Australia, the US and Vanuatu, will be back in a more familiar outfit - a prison uniform.
