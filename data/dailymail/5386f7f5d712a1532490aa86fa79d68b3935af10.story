Labour MP Frank Field has complained angrily to Green Party leader Natalie Bennett over claims a Green protester tried to photograph him after he had a heart attack.

There were fears for veteran campaigner Field’s life when he collapsed at a rowdy meeting in his Birkenhead constituency last weekend.

Field, 72, recovered after being taken to hospital. But Labour supporters claim Green activist Colin Dow tried to photograph him as he lay on the floor unconscious waiting for an ambulance.

MP Frank Field has complained to Green Party leader Natalie Bennett over claims a Green protester tried to take a photograph of him after he had a heart attack

‘To take a photo of someone who has just had a heart attack would be a despicable thing to do,’ Mr Field told The Mail on Sunday.

‘Some members of the Green Party are the kind of people who infiltrated the Labour party in Merseyside years ago. 

We got rid of them and some have resurfaced in the Greens. This kind of behaviour has no place in public life.

‘Everyone thinks the Greens are cuddly and fluffy but the truth is very different. It is high time Natalie Bennett denounced them.’

The incident occurred during a meeting hosted by Mr Field to discuss plans to sell-off of the site of Rock Ferry High School. Green activists, including Mr Dow, led protests.

‘Had I been closer, I would have taken a picture,’ Colin Dow said

Mr Field said: ‘I told the police I did not want the protesters to force the meeting to be stopped. I was happy to continue. Later, I felt chest pains and collapsed.’

Mr Dow, a former Labour party member, last night confirmed he took his camera out when Mr Field collapsed but was told by a Labour councillor not to take a picture.

He said he complied but denied he was being ‘insensitive’ as it was a public meeting.

‘Had I been closer, I would have taken a picture,’ he said.

He claimed others present did take photographs, and he hit back at Mr Field on his Facebook site, challenging the former Labour Minister’s ‘imagined version’.

He said the MP behaved ‘insultingly’ towards protesters.
