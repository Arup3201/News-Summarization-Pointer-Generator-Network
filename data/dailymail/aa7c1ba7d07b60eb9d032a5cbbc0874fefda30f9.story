The United States has no plans to restrict travel from African countries hard-hit by the Ebola virus epidemic, the Obama administration said Monday.

At the same time, the president's chief spokesman said the U.S. won't absolutely rule it out.

'A travel ban is not something that we're currently considering,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.

'We feel good about the measures that are already in place,' he insisted.

'Our experts continue to be confident that the medical infrastructure that we have in this country is sufficient to prevent an Ebola outbreak from occurring,' Earnest said.

He continued Monday to project confidence, which some have interpreted as reassuring while others see it as complacency.

Still, he adopted a never-say-never attitude when pressed on the subject.

'This is something that we regularly assess and re-assess, and – so I wouldn't rule out any changes in the future,' he said. 

Earnest explained that a back-and-forth flow of aviation traffic is needed in order to fight the Ebola outbreak from an ocean away.

'We're relying on the commercial transportation system to move supplies and personnel into the region,' he said.

'So we don't want to obstruct one of the core components of our strategy.' 

The administration is relying heavily on what Earnest called 'a multi-layered screening protocol' to spare Americans from the kind of public health devastation that has brought three countries to their knees and killed thousands.

'There are extensive screening measures on the ground in west Africa where this outbreak has occurred,' he said, adding that 'there's guidelines and guidance and training that has been given to flight crews.'

'There also is a protocol in place for Customs and Border Patrol officers who are manning our ports of entry,' Earnest added, 'to be on the lookout for individuals, again, that may be exhibiting symptoms of Ebola – in other words, that are contagious with Ebola.'

But health officials said Sunday that they are considering the approval of new measures designed to provide the U.S. with one extra firewall, such as checking the body temperature of everyone who enters the U.S. from an affected nation.

Other pandemics have seen similar strategies. In 2009, at the height of the avian influenza scare, China and other Asian nations required temperature checks of every passenger deplaning in Beijing and other major points of entry.

But those modest steps, like the more drastic travel ban proposals, are just drawing-board ideas.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that a 'discussion is underway right now' and 'all options are being looked at' for new U.S.-based screening plans.

But the question, he told CNN, is whether 'the extra level of screening is going to be worth the resources you need to put into it.

At a press conference Sunday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Dr. Thomas Frieden declared: 'There's no doubt that we can stop Ebola in this country.'

He also said current screening protocols in Africa have stopped 77 potentially Ebola-infected people from boarding planes to America.

The Ebola virus is transmitted via contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

The current strain of the virus is believed to have killed about half of the people it has infected in Africa. U.S. officials stressed Friday during a White House press conference that America's public health system is more robust and will adequately protect the public.
