Sir Alex Ferguson paid a visit to Altrincham on Monday to officially unveil their eye-catching new community sports hall.

The former Manchester United manager - one of the most respected figures in world football - took time out from his busy schedule to open the new facility at the J.Davidson Stadium, with the Robins chairman Grahame Rowley labelling it an 'entirely fitting' way of launching the sports hall.

In a press release Rowley said: 'There was much debate about who should conduct the opening ceremony, but you simply cannot get a bigger name anywhere in football than Sir Alex Ferguson.

'We couldn't possibly have wished for anything or anyone better.'

Ferguson had originally agreed to officially open the hall last month, but due to business commitments out of the country was unable to do so. 

However, the 73-year-old stuck to his word and rearranged a later date with the club to open the sports hall.

Speaking at the event Ferguson said: 'This new community sports hall at Altrincham F.C. is going to be an invaluable resource for the club and community for years to come.

'It will provide opportunities for children and adults to get involved in sport regardless of the weather. 

'The hall also doubles to cater for match day hospitality, which will act as a springboard for the club to grow commercially.

'The money to make all this possible has come from the Premier League & The FA Facilities Fund, which is delivered by the Football Foundation and funded by the Premier League, The F.A. and the Government, through Sport England. 

'That is a strong and important partnership as every footballer ultimately starts out at the grassroots.

'This sort of project is the perfect example of how the Football Foundation is working with its Funders to provide football clubs with facilities that get more people playing sport, support football clubs' excellent community outreach work and create talent pathways through which promising youngsters can progress.'

The impressive, multi-purpose single-storey building will provide a platform for a range of activities to be hosted including after-school clubs, disabled groups and ballroom dancing to yoga, martial arts, indoor bowls and badminton.

As well as that it will be used as a community hub which can be used throughout the week, as well as on match days.
