Generous Louis van Gaal negotiated a £1.2million donation to charity as part of his first contract as Manchester United manager.

The 62-year-old, who stepped down as Holland boss after leading them to third place at the World Cup, saved United a hefty sum by not using an agent to negotiate his deal.

Instead, Van Gaal requested that the club donate the money to his favourite charity - a £600,000 fee he matched himself, as revealed by The Sun.

Van Gaal's chosen charity, for whom is an ambassador, is Dutch-based Muscles for Muscles, who raises awareness for spinal muscular atrophy.

A Sun source said: 'This is typical of Louis. He is a great man and a generous man.

'He has spent years working with charity and helped raise so much money for those less fortunate.'

Manchester United declined to comment on the story because it is a private matter.

Van Gaal, who gives his first press conference at United on Thursday, has signed a two-year deal at Old Trafford.

United leave for their pre-season tour of the US on Friday.
