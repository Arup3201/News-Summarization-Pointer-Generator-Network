Tim Sherwood has been installed as the bookmakers favourite to take over as Aston Villa manager following the sacking of Paul Lambert.

The ex-Tottenham manager had also been heavily linked with the Queens Park Rangers job and held talks about succeeding Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road last week.

Sherwood received a mixed reaction during his short stint at Spurs but could be the right man to get an immediate reaction from the players at Villa Park and save them from the drop.

Tim Sherwood 6/4, Jurgen Klinsmann 8/1 

Neil Lennon 12/1, Christophe Galtier 20/1

David Moyes 20/1, Glenn Hoddle 20/1

Uwe Rosler 20/1, Alan Curbishley 20/1

Nigel Adkins 20/1, Mark Hughes 25/1

Michael Laudrup 25/1, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 33/1

Steve Bruce 66/1, Roy Keane 66/1 

Following Lambert's departure, Jamie Carragher let his feelings known on Twitter by saying, 'Tim Sherwood will now be linked with Aston Villa he's becoming the new Alan Curbishley [a regular contender for managerial positions].' 

USA boss Jurgen Klinsmann is second favourite to get the job and the American connection with Lerner could prove pivotal in his decision.

Other names bookies have linked with the job are Bolton's Neil Lennon, David Moyes and Roy Keane - who most recently left the club as Lambert's assistant manager.

Lambert was sacked on Wednesday following the clubs loss to Hull CIty - which made it ten league games without a win.

The Scotsman signed a new contract in the first few weeks of the season after Villa made a promising start to the campaign.

That didn't last for long and soon the club began to slip further down the table and now find themselves in the bottom three.

Villa also have the unwanted record of only scoring 12 goals in the Premier League this season, so chairman Randy Lerner will hoping whoever he appoints can get the team firing.
