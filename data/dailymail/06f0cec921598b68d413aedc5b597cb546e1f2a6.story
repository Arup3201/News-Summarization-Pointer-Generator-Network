Fatal: Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging was flying Red 4 when his aircraft ran into difficulty

The horrified wife of a Red Arrows pilot was watching as he crashed his plane into a river and died yesterday.

Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging’s Hawk 
T1 jet plummeted to the ground as it and eight other Red Arrows left 
Bournemouth Air Festival to stage an afternoon fly-past over 
Christchurch.

His wife Emma, 32, a museums consultant, was in the crowd watching the 
display.

She said: ‘Jon was the best friend and husband I 
could ever have wished for. There was nothing bad about Jon. I loved everything about him.’

Flt Lieut Egging, 33, fought to 
manoeuvre his plane away from the village of Throop, crashing into a 
field before plunging into the River Stour.

Chief Inspector Steve White, of Dorset Police, said: 'On approach to the airport one aircraft crashed into a field near Throop Mill, Bournemouth.

'The aircraft came to rest on the banks of the River Stour, and the emergency services including police, fire, ambulance, coastguard search and rescue and a Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance attended.

'Sadly the pilot, who had been thrown from the aircraft, was pronounced dead at the scene.'

He said the emergency services responded as soon as they received information of the crash, and added that he did not know whether the pilot ejected from the aircraft.

It is understood that a Mayday call was 
issued just before the jet went out of control. A BBC camera crew was 
ordered to stop filming the display as soon as the call was received.

But officials refused to speculate on what may have called the crash, 
confirming only that an investigation will be conducted.

Happy: Jon, who always aspired to be a pilot, shares a special moment with his proud wife, Emma

In a statement, the Ministry of 
Defence said: 'It is with sadness that the MOD must confirm the death of
 Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging of the Royal Air Force Aerobatics Team The
 Red Arrows.

'Flight 
Lieutenant Egging was killed when his Hawk T1 aircraft – Red 4 – crashed
 around 1km South East of Bournemouth Airport at 1350 on Saturday 20 
August 2011.

'A full 
Service Inquiry into the details of the crash has been initiated. It 
would be inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident at 
this time.'

The Red Arrows were performing at the Bournemouth Air Festival when the accident happened.

Eyewitnesses describe a dramatic rescue 
attempt by dog walkers, who jumped into the water.

Pub manager Wayne Kent, 30, said: 
‘Somehow he managed to avoid houses. Customers told me it bounced 
several times in the field and then headed towards the river.’

Witness Shaun Spencer-Perkins added: 
‘I heard a whoosh behind me and turned to see a Red Arrow flying below 
the tree line. It hit the bank on the other side of the river and burst 
into pieces.’

It is understood that Flt Lieut Egging tried to eject.

Peter Male, whose brother owns the 
land where the jet crashed, said: ‘The parachute was in the river and 
two men jumped in to try to save the pilot.

‘But when they pulled the parachute out, nothing was attached to it. Ten minutes later, they found the body along the bank.’

Radio enthusiast Malcolm MacIntyre, 37,  told the Bournemouth Echo that he'd listened in on radio communications between the team and the control tower, just before the crash.

He said that just after the Red Arrows called to land by the tower, one of the pilots said: 'Are you aware of the Mayday?'

The reply was: 'Yes, we are, somebody is dealing with that.'

Mr MacIntyre added: 'I am completely shocked.'

One eyewitness, Laura Goodwin, told Sky News that the accident happened just after the team had completed its display.

She said: 'One plane went one way, one went the other and didn't come back. A lot of people are in disbelief about what happened.'

Another witness said that dog walkers pulled the pilot from a river, near the village of Throop.

The crash location was confirmed by Shaun Spencer-Perkins, who witnessed the crash from Throop Mill.

He told the BBC: 'I heard a rushing sound and I saw a plane about 50ft above the ground racing across the fields. It impacted and bounced across the field, made it across the river.

'Members of the public jumped into the water to search for the cockpit.

'We waved down the helicopter, I took off my son's orange jacket and my wife's red jumper to get the attention of the helicopter.'

He added that there was no sign of the pilot and he didn't see a parachute.

Wayne Kent, 30, the assistant manager of the Broadway Pub, said some of his customers had seen the incident.

He said: 'I heard that the plane went down in the fields near Throop and it bounced three or four times. The pilot then steered it towards the river.'

Mr Kent said the pilot guided the plane away from houses in the village and from people walking near the riverbank.

Bournemouth Airport released a statement about the incident on its website.

It read: 'A spokesperson for Bournemouth Airport has confirmed that an incident involving a Red Arrows aircraft took place approximately one mile away from the airport this afternoon.'

The Air Festival, meanwhile, which has drawn crowds of over 200,000, is continuing to run.

Since 1979, the Red Arrows have used the dual control BAE Systems Hawk T1 aircraft.

According to the aerobatic team's website, the planes' Rolls Royce engines produce 5,200lbs of thrust and give a top speed of Mach 1.2.

They have been based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire since 2001.

Gifted: Flight Lieutenant Egging, pictured last month, had been with the Red Arrows for less than a year

Flight  Lieutenant Egging joined the RAF in 2000. He qualified as a Harrier pilot and served in Afghanistan before returning to the UK as a Squadron Qualified Flying Instructor.

He lived in the village of Morcott, Rutland, with his wife Emma.

On joining the Red Arrows, he said:  ‘Emma is a driving force behind my career and she is as proud as Punch of me.’

A profile of the dead pilot on the Red Arrows website reads: 'Jon became interested in flying at an early age, inspired by his airline pilot father who used to take him down route, allowing him into the cockpit for take off and landing.

'Jon attended Southam School in Warwickshire gaining A-Levels in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. He was a member of 2028 (Southam) Sqn Air Training Corps from age 13.

'During the sixth form he was awarded
 a Royal Air Force Flying Scholarship and had his first solo flight in a
 Cessna 152 flying from Wellesbourne Mountford Aerodrome. Following a 
gap year spent working in the UK and travelling around Australia, Jon 
went on to read a BSc in Environmental Science at Southampton 
University.

'He joined Southampton University Air Squadron and was awarded a Royal Air Force Bursary in his second year.'

Still reeling from the tragic death, colleagues tonight paid tribute to the crack pilot.

Group
 Captain Simon Blake, the Commandant of the RAF’s Central Flying School,
 said: 'Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, known as Eggman, joined the Team 
as Red 4 in the Autumn of 2010.

'A
 gifted aviator, he was chosen to fly in the Red 4 slot, on the right 
hand outside of the famous Diamond Nine formation - an accolade in 
itself being the most demanding position allocated to a first year 
pilot.

'Throughout his winter training and the display season to date, his professionalism, skill and humility have shone through.'

'A true team player, his good nature and constant smile will be sorely missed by all.  In such a close knit team, this tragedy will be keenly felt by his fellow team members, the Reds and all of the engineering and support staff, the Blues.'

Air Vice Marshal Mark Green, Air Officer Commanding 22 (Training) Group, added: 'I first met Flt Lt Jon Egging in 2003 when I became his Station Commander. Even at that early stage in his career, Jon's professionalism, competence and ever present smile made him stand out from the crowd. Hence, his eventual selection for duties with the Red Arrows came as no surprise.

'His time with the Team was typified by the characteristics that were Jon's trademark: professionalism, enthusiasm for life and a willingness to help others that transcended all boundaries. Jon will be sorely missed by all those that had the privilege to know him; our thoughts and prayers are with Jon's family and friends at this tragic time.'
