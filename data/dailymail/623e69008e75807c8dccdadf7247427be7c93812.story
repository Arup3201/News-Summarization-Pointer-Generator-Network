Britain is facing a new winter of discontent after unions yesterday promised a campaign of strikes and civil disobedience.

They have voted unanimously for co-ordinated industrial action to try to halt government cuts and ‘stick the boot in’ to the Coalition.

They also called for schools and hospitals to be occupied by local residents.

At the TUC’s annual conference in 
Brighton, unions agreed to ‘give full support to all groups of workers 
in the private or public sector who take industrial action against cuts 
or attacks on pay, jobs, pensions or conditions of service and 
co-ordinating unions taking strike action’.

Bob Crow, the militant leader of the 
RMT transport union, said: ‘If you spit on your own, you can’t do 
anything.

But if you all spit together, you can drown the b******s.’

Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades 
Union, said: ‘In the early years of the Thatcher government we occupied 
the hospitals.

That’s the sort of thing we should be demanding.

‘When they want to close down a youth
centre, when they want to close down a school or a hospital, if 
communities want to occupy them, we are going to support them.’

To add to the chaos, a pensioners’ 
group leader, who was speaking at a TUC fringe meeting, offered support 
for the campaign of civil disobedience.

Dot Gibson, of the National 
Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘I am in favour of direct action, sit in 
the road, things like that, go into the lobby of the town hall, mob 
handed, and say we are not going to move.’

The TUC is expected to debate today 
whether or not to agree to investigate the ‘practicalities’ of 
organising a general strike, the first national stoppage since 1926.

Steve Gillan, of the Prison Officers 
Association, which proposed the motion, said: ‘There are real cracks in 
the Coalition at this time and I think we should stick the boot in and 
finish them off.

‘The Tories aren’t embarrassed to 
threaten us so we shouldn’t be embarrassed to use the ultimate weapon in
our armoury.’ Business leaders said strikes were a mistake in the midst
of the longest and deepest downturn for more than a century.

Protesters march with placards in November last year in London as more than two million public sector workers staged a nationwide strike over cuts to their public sector pensions

Simon Walker, of the Institute of 
Directors, said: ‘The taxpayer cannot afford to provide public sector 
unions with the seemingly limitless cash they demand. It is vital that 
the Government, as their employer, stands firm.’

And David Cameron’s official 
spokesman warned strike threats would not persuade ministers to change 
their minds over the two-year public sector pay freeze.

'Beyond the boutiques of Notting Hill and the mansions of Kensington, there is another country. A Britain of boarded-up high streets, pawnbrokers and food banks.'

Ed Miliband sought to distance 
himself from militant union barons at the TUC annual dinner last night, 
saying: ‘It’s what’s happening in our economy that makes so many people 
angry with the Government.

The public doesn’t want to see strikes. Nor 
do your members. Nor do you.’

In a conference speech, TUC leader 
Brendan Barber warned of rising inequality. ‘Beyond the boutiques of 
Notting Hill and the mansions of Kensington, there is another country,’ 
he said.

‘A Britain of boarded-up high streets, pawnbrokers and food banks. A Britain of stratospheric inequality.’
