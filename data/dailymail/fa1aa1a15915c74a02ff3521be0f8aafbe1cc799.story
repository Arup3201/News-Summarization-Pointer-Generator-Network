An 11-year-old boy has revealed his talent for speaking backwards in a video posted online by his father.

In the five-minute clip on YouTube, Cameron's father gives him sentences to say backwards. Scottish boy Cameron uses an iPad app that reverses speech to demonstrate his talent.

The app transposes regular speech into 
backwards speech, but since Cameron is already speaking backwards to 
begin with the sentences become understandable when played through the
app.

Turned around: 11-year-old Cameron from Scotland has picked up the talent of being able to speak backwards

He starts off with the simple sentence of 'My name is Cameron and I live in Scotland', before his dad starts giving him more complex sentences such as: 'I went outside to play on my bike today'.

Cameron was also asked in the video - posted in April 2012 - to say backwards: 'I'm going to Canada for my summer holidays'. He can also count from one to 20 backwards.

For the grand finale, he says the title of Mary Poppins sons 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' - which many people have a hard time pronouncing forwards.  

But some YouTube users were not impressed by Cameron and claimed the video was a sham. 'This would be easy to memorise with time. I would like to see him do this publicly for proof,' one user said.

Precocious: Perhaps his most amazing stunt in the video is being able to say the tongue-twister Mary Poppins song backwards

But Cameron is not the first young person to come forward with the ability to speak backwards.

In February 2012, teenager Alyssa Kramer made her own video on YouTube where friends would give her words and she would say them backwards within three seconds.

After being viewed more than 1million times online, Alyssa, of Poteau, Oklahoma, was featured on The Today Show where she further proved her talent.

According
to Alyssa, she picked up the talent when she first started reading and 
it's all about visualizing the words backwards.

'Someone will say the word and then my brain will flip it for me and I'll just read it that way,' she said.
