New research has found than more 300,000 Australians are living with a chlamydia but more than three quarters of them have no idea that they are infected.

It's a staggering figure considering the infection can be prevented for less than $10 and cured with one pill.

‘It’s the common cold of the genitals,’ Dr Jane Hocking from the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia.

Chlamydia is most highly reported condition amongst Australians; more prevalent than any cancer or even influenza.

Five per cent of young adults will have chlamydia. In Australia, there is a one in 20 chance of any person having sex with someone with chlamydia

Yet many more cases go unreported according to new data, which indicates that thousands of people unknowingly live with and subsequently spread the infection.

This has led professionals to regard the disease as ‘the silent epidemic’.

‘Five per cent of young adults will have chlamydia. There is a one in 20 chance of having sex with someone with chlamydia,’ said Dr Hocking, who recently worked on a research paper into chlamydia with the UNSW Kirby Institute.

’80 per cent of the time people with chlamydia have no symptoms.

'The means 80 per cent of all infected people possibly have no idea they have it and will keep transmitting it,’ said Dr Hocking.

The Kirby Insitute's new research has found that around 356,000 Australians were infected with chlamydia in 2013, but only 8000 are diagnosed every year. 

'For every case that’s diagnosed four to five cases are undiagnosed,’ said David Wilson, who also contributed to the Kirby Institute's data collection.

It is crucial for misconceptions about the STI to be clarified so more people have the confidence to get tested. 

‘Having chlamydia doesn't mean you’re having a lot of sex or sex with a lot of different partners,' Dr Hocking emphasised.

‘It’s very easy to catch.’ 

However, a startling result from the research found transmission occurs most commonly for young teens between the ages of 15 and 17. 

The prevalence of chlamydia amongst high school students has led health professionals to suggest the introduction of condom vending machines in high schools. 

‘We do need to look at ways to increase condom accessibility, particularly amongst adolescents,’ said Dr Hocking.

‘Studies have shown that condom use and awareness has increased compared to a decade ago, but to get a young person to use a condom every time they have sex – I think you’ll never achieve that.’

The reasons why people are not tested are varied, but a lot of it has to do with embarrassment and a lack of education.

'People don't get tested or ask questions because of a combination of embarrassment, lack of confidence and lack of knowledge. Also, some people are just not thinking too hard about it at all!' said Dr Hocking.

Although chlamydia is not life-threatening it can have devastating consequences.

Many young women do not realise they are suffering from the infliction until years later when they try to conceive, at which case the damage is irreparable. 

The average Australian woman will be 30 when she first tries to have a baby, meaning a woman can live for more than a decade without treating their STI as their reproductive organs progressively become more damaged.

‘Chlamydia will mainly become an issue for women. If the infection goes untreated, 10 per cent of cases are likely to develop pelvic inflammatory disease which can lead to infertility,’ said Dr Hocking.

It is critical that men do not disregard chlamydia as being 'a woman's issue'. 

‘However, the burden needs to be shared by both. Blokes need to be treated so they don’t continue to transmit it.

‘It’s a pity that women are the ones that carry the burden of extra health consequences.’

A large part of the problem is that young people focus on preventing pregnancies so will use a contraceptive, but do not give much thought to sexual health so do not prioritise using a condom

A large part of the problem is that young people focus on preventing pregnancies so will use a contraceptive, but do not give much thought to sexual health so do not prioritise using a condom.

‘Young girls will often go to a doctor and chat about contraception, but for young people in general STIs are not on their radar.’

This problem may be a result of Australians as a natural being particularly prudish when it comes to talking about 'the birds and the bees'.

‘It would take a major cultural change in Australia to change the problem, it will not be a solution overnight,’ said Wilson.

‘In the Netherlands, people are much more open about the issue of sex. Children will talk about their sexual life with their parents.’

‘The Netherlands have a much lower rate of unplanned pregnancies and STIs because they have a more open approach to sex ed and the discussion is a normalised part of society,’ agreed Dr Hocking.

It is becoming a more pressing issue to raise awareness of the importance of safe sex as casual dating apps become increasingly popular in Australia.

‘It will be interesting to see if STIs increase with the introduction of apps like Tinder and Grindr, which make hooking up so much easier,’ said Dr Hocking. 

The disease is just as easy to treat as it is to prevent.

‘It’s just a single dose of antibiotics! That’s it.’
