Two supermarket workers are accused of stealing $45,000 from their own workplace to fund a sex change.

Spencer Cullen, 23, is a woman who wants to become a man and allegedly helped take the cash from a Walmart store in Prescott, Arizona, so she could pay for the operation.

Cullen, whose middle name is Danger, is still physically a woman but is said to have been preparing for the gender-swap for some time.

Adriano Altiveros, 19, bought himself a new car from his half of the proceeds, police have said.

The Walmart, which is around around 80 miles north west of Phoenix, was robbed last Thursday and the pair were arrested a day later.

'Cullen told detectives that her motive for stealing the money was to go forward with a sex change operation that she had wanted,' Prescott police spokesman lieutenant Andy Reinhardt said.

'I don't believe that she had made arrangements at that point, but I do believe that she had already started the process to become a man.

'Altiveros assisted by distracting cashiers that worked just outside the cash office.

'Through investigation and surveillance video, detectives determined that a key was used to enter a locked cash office where $45,000 in cash had been removed.'

Both Cullen and Altiveros are in jail charged with felony burglary and theft.

After the robbery, Cullen gave the cash to Altiveros, who then used $22,000 to buy a Toyota Supra car from a private seller in the Phoenix area, police said.

The two suspects were being held in custody and police said today that all but 31 cents of the stolen money had been recovered.

In a further twist, if convicted Cullen could choose to sue while in jail if she is not treated properly by the authorities.

Boston murderer Michelle Kosilek, who is male, sued the Massachusetts Department of Corrections because he was not being adequately treated for gender-identity disorder.

The judge ruled Kosilek could receive female hormones to help deal with anxiety and depression, but stopped short of allowing Kosilek to get a tax-payer funded sex-change operation.
