A 69-year-old St Louis woman has been arrested for the stabbing murder of her husband after police were called to a Country Life Acres home early Thursday morning and found the body of a 76-year-old man.

Mary Ann Mullenix was taken into custody by police for allegedly killing her millionaire former property-developer husband of 42 years, Ivan L. Mullenix, Sr.

She has been charged with 
second-degree murder, armed criminal action and tampering with evidence 
and is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail.

Ivan L. Mullenix and his wife had lived in the large house complete with pool and tennis court and surrounded by leafy gardens in the small village of Country Life Acres, near the suburban Town and Country area, for 35 years.

Ivan L. Mullenix, Sr was a successful 
real estate developer for many years, having only recently passed on his
business to his three sons from his first marriage.

Mullenix
Companies, established by Ivan 'Ike' Mullenix, Sr in 1964, managed 
several hundred million dollars worth of real estate.

The
three eldest Mullenix sons bought out their father’s business in 2006 
and changed it to Equis Hospitality Management. But the handover wasn't 
smooth and the sons sued their father a few years later, alleging he had
violated the terms of the buyout.

The suit was dismissed last year and lawyer for the three Mullenix sons, Joseph Trad, said it was amicably settled.

Mary Mullenix was Ivan Mullenix's second wife. They married in 1971 and had four children.

It's not clear who dialed 911, but police have said it was not Mary Mullenix but a different family member.

According to Fox2 Now, when
police arrived at the property in the the exclusive neighborhood, they 
found Ivan Mullenix's body inside and Mary Mullenix outside.

Neighbor Tim Clark said the village has only 28 homes but that he wasn't close with his neighbors the Mullenixes. 

He had, however, encountered Mary Mullenix on a number of occasions and described her as 'frazzled' and 'a bit odd'.

Reporters asked Clark how he felt about the murder in his neighborhood.

'Honestly?
I told my wife it didn't surprise me, just from things I've heard. I've
heard that there's been calls out here for fires and I've heard that it
was maybe someone smoking in bed... I don't think anyone's worried... I
imagine that if she killed him she won't be back,' he said.

A police spokesman said this wasn't the first time officers had been called to the upscale home.

'They
have a history... they have a rather stormy relationship, this is what 
is beginning to develop. There's a lot more investigation ongoing,' he 
said.

Ivan Mullenix's sons said in a statement on Thursday afternoon: 'At this point, we have no comment on the personal tragedy resulting in the death of our father, Ivan L. Mullenix, Sr. We are deeply saddened and would appreciate the news media respecting our privacy at this time.'

Police have not yet revealed a possible motive in the murder.
