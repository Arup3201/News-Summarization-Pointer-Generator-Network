It is often said that the greatest leaders are those who can delegate responsibility.

Prime Ministers, Presidents and world leaders have all spoken through history of the effectiveness of spreading the burden of power amongst the right people.

This is an approach which Roy Hodgson is adopting as England manager by handing extra responsibility to Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Gary Cahill to act as 'unit leaders' among his squad.

England boss Roy Hodgson has created 'unit leaders' within his squad to improve performances

The England manager is trying something different in the wake of a diabolical World Cup in Brazil and the need to reignite the national mood around the team.

Hodgson has set up 'unit meetings' – split into attack, midfield and defence – in an attempt to get his team animated.

Striker Sturridge, midfielder Henderson and defender Cahill have been handed the responsibility of galvanising their respective groups.

In these meetings England coaches play videos of matches and training to talk players through how they can improve, but it is no longer a one-way process.

'There are three units,' Hodgson explained ahead of Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia next week. 'We're trying to encourage players to take responsibility, to take ownership of their performances and to speak out.

'So the meetings aren't just the coaches with their videos and their principles telling the players this is it, this is what we expect you to do.

'We're asking them to stand up themselves and make certain, so when we leave the meeting we know the players have understood everything completely, that there's no chance they've sat there quietly listening to us, nodding their heads wisely but not fully certain of what's required.'

This is a far cry from the scene set by Rio Ferdinand when he claimed that England players were 'treated like complete babies' in the launch of his new book last week.

Hodgson pointed out that the Queens Park Rangers defender had never been a part of any of his squads since he took charge two-and-a-half years ago.

And this is very much Hodgson empowering his players to stand up and be counted.

'In each of the groups I've asked people like Daniel Sturridge, Gary Cahill and Jordan Henderson to make certain they animate the group, that they prod people,' Hodgson added.

'We'll prod, the coaches, but I've always prodded in every team meeting I've done. I've always asked for questions, but often you don't get a response.

'I'm asking for the prodding to come from the players themselves where one of them will turn round to the group and say, 'Look, what do you think? Do you understand? Is the message clear to you? Do you really now understand what's required?'

'Get people to speak, that's what it's all about.'

At the head of them all is captain Wayne Rooney. His temperament and ability to lead the national team has been questioned since he was sent off for kicking Stewart Downing in Manchester United's match against West Ham last weekend. 

But Hodgson insisted: 'If someone wants to write that Rooney hasn't got the temperament I can't stop them doing it. All I can tell you is: they are wrong.

'I am happy with Rooney, I am happy with the role he is playing, I am happy with the responsibility he is taking, and I think the other players are too.

'He is filling big boots. Not just of Steven Gerrard, he has played in teams with different captains before him and many of them were top men.'

Hodgson added: 'The great thing with Wayne as it was with Steve, is the passion they have for football, for their country, and for their clubs – both were basically one-club men if you take Rooney leaving Everton at a young age.

'They can transmit that passion to a lot of the younger players. They can get their points across.'
