One of the disgraced badminton players disqualified from the Olympic Games for deliberately throwing a match has revealed she is quitting the sport.

Chinese player Yu Yang was top seed in the women's doubles with her partner Wang Xiaoli. Today it was reported she announced her retirement on her micro-blog, bidding 'farewell' to the sport.

Chinese officials had told their Olympic badminton team leader and shamed players to make a public apology following the scandal, and chief coach Li Yongbo has since taken responsibility for China's part in the scandal.

The other women's doubles players 
implicated were South Korean pairs Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na, and Ha 
Jung-eun and Kim Min-jung, plus Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari of 
Indonesia.

'The delegation has already severely 
criticised and educated the responsible badminton leaders, team and 
relevant players and demanded they profoundly recognise the seriousness 
and the harmfulness of this matter, reflect deeply on it, publicly 
apologise and resolutely prevent such incidents from happening again,' 
the Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted an unnamed spokesman as saying.

Li, chief coach of the Chinese 
badminton team, said the poor behaviour of his players reflected the 
shortcomings of new rules in the sport.

'I feel that no matter whether it is 
the rules or something else, that's no excuse,' said Li. 'The key point 
is we did not behave professionally as athletes and did not treat each 
match seriously.

'We didn't strive with all our might 
in the Olympic way. From that point of view we really didn't grasp this 
point thoroughly ... as chief coach I really feel I must say sorry to 
fans and viewers nationwide,' Li told Xinhua.

The eight players were thrown out of 
the Games for throwing matches in a bid to secure more favourable draws 
later in the tournament.

The players had all qualified for the 
quarter-finals of the women’s doubles and were accused of trying to 
manipulate the draw by losing so they would be matched with easier 
opposition in the next round or avoid playing their teammates.

Amid shameful and embarrassing scenes,
players were deliberately serving into the net or hitting the 
shuttlecock over the court’s lines. The longest rally in one set lasted 
just four shots.

As a furious backlash grew, Lord Coe, head of London 2012, described the players’ actions as ‘depressing' and 'unacceptable’.

The spotlight will be on the Chinese, who dominate world badminton but have been accused of manipulation before.

Petya Nedelcheva, a Bulgarian player 
who was on an adjacent court at the time of the first match, said 
Chinese players routinely tried to avoid playing each other.

She said: ‘China control everything. I
don’t know who controlled the match to lose but if it is China again, 
they did it so many times last year – they didn’t play against each 
other in 20 matches. They do what they want.’

The Wembley fiasco began when Chinese
top seeds Wang and Yu started to show little interest in 
beating Koreans Jung and Kim to finish top of Group A.

Coming second would have meant avoiding compatriots and second seeds Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei until the final.

The Koreans responded to China’s antics by copying them.

Referee Torsten Berg warned all the 
players and produced a black card, meaning they would be disqualified. 
After protests, this was rescinded.

The match restarted and the Koreans went on to win 21-14, 21-11.

The matter did not end there as a 
second Korean pair, third seeds Ha Jung-eun and Kim Min-jung, attempted 
to engineer defeat in their match against Indonesia’s Meiliana Jauhari 
and Greysia Polii.

Their motive was apparent retaliation 
to avoid Xiaoli and Yang in the quarter-finals, an outcome they failed 
to achieve as they won 18-21, 21-14, 21-12.

The Indonesians were not bystanders in the affair as they responded to the Koreans by trying to lose themselves.

Yu reportedly made an announcement via a verified account on Chinese social media site Weibo.

The coach of the Japanese women's football team has been told he won't be disciplined - even though he admitted ordering his players not to win a match at the Olympics.

Norio Sasaki told his team not to push for a winning goal during their 0-0 draw with South Africa because he knew a victory would force them to play a quarter-final in Glasgow - 350 miles from their Cardiff base.

At a press conference after Tuesday's match, Sasaki said the draw had been an ideal result.Japan would have topped their group with a win, but the draw meant they finished second.

Consequently, their quarter-final against Brazil on Friday will be played in Cardiff.

'It was a different way of playing compared to the usual game, but the players were on the same page as me,' Sasaki said through a translator.

'I feel sorry we couldn't show a respectable game, but it's my responsibility, not the players, why the game was like that.'It was important for us not to move to Glasgow.'

Football's governing body, FIFA, said its disciplinary committee had studied Sasaki’s comments and 'there are no sufficient elements to start disciplinary proceedings' for corruption or 'unlawfully influencing match results'.

'This is my last game. Farewell Badminton World Federation. Farewell my dear badminton," she posted.

Meanwhile Chinese head coach Li has 
taken responsibility for the farce, telling Chinese news agency Xinhua: 
'As head coach, I owe the supporters of Chinese badminton and the 
Chinese TV audiences an apology.

'Chinese players failed to demonstrate the fine tradition and fighting spirit of the national team.

'It's me to blame.'

Gail Emms, the former British 
badminton star and Olympic silver medallist, said: ‘You cannot do this 
in an Olympic Games, this is something that is not acceptable . . . it 
was just disgraceful.’

Miss Emms said the potential for 
match-fixing was raised in a managers’ meeting on Monday but the referee
had dismissed concerns.

She added: ‘All the managers got 
together with the referee and said, “look, this has happened; in Group D
you will find some very dodgy matches going on in the evening because 
of it” and the referee laughed and said “don’t be silly”.

‘The managers said “we know the game, we know the players and we know the teams and we know this is going to happen”.’

Korea’s coach Sung Han-kook laid the 
blame squarely at the feet of China. He said: ‘The Chinese started this.
They did it first. They didn’t want to meet each other in the 
semi-final.’

After the players' disqualification, their places will be taken by the 
teams who finished third and fourth in their qualifying groups concerned
– Canada, Australia, Russia and South Africa.

Locog said fans would not be given any
refunds, even though some paid up to £80 to see the world’s best 
players. Chief executive Paul Deighton said: ‘You get in to all sorts of
strange precedents if people aren’t satisfied with what they see – it 
is very grey and dangerous territory.’

BWF
secretary-general Thomas Lund said: 'The regulations clearly state you 
have to win every match and you cannot throw some matches to win other 
matches.

'There's no two ways about that and that is what the disciplinary committee found in the principles of the Olympic spirit.

'The disqualification is from this event and there are no further punishments from now on.'
