Newcastle United vs Chelsea (St James' Park) 

Team news

Newcastle

Moussa Sissoko and Jack Colback will return from suspension as Newcastle bid to become the first side to beat Chelsea this season in the Saturday lunchtime kick-off at St James' Park.

Sissoko and Colback missed the midweek draw at Burnley and their return is a welcome boost to Magpies boss Alan Pardew who has a number of injury concerns.

Captain Fabricio Coloccini is unlikely to be risked as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury while Mike Williamson, Daryl Janmaat and Sammy Ameobi all face late fitness tests.

Provisional squad: Elliot, Alnwick, Janmaat, Dummett, Williamson, S. Taylor, Streete, Haidara, Tiote, Anita, Cabella, Sissoko, Colback, Gouffran, Ameobi, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong, Woodman, Abeid.

Chelsea

Diego Costa will start Chelsea's Premier League trip to Newcastle on Saturday after suspension.

The Spain hitman will return for the Blues at St James' Park even though both Didier Drogba and Loic Remy both found the net in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Tottenham.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

After five home games without a win against Chelsea, the Magpies have won the last two Premier League matches against the Blues at St James Park.

Eden Hazard has scored four goals in three Premier League appearances against Newcastle United – more than against any other side.

In the last four games where Newcastle have actually found the net against Chelsea, at least one of their goals has been scored in or after the 89th minute.

Newcastle’s 2-0 win over Chelsea at St James’ Park in November 2013 is Alan Pardew’s only Premier League victory over Jose Mourinho (L5).

Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea have never won at St James’ Park in four visits (D2 L2).

Chelsea are unbeaten in their last 23 games (in all competitions), they have never before gone 24 competitive games in a row without defeat.

The suspended Nemanja Matic was booked in only one of his opening eight Premier League appearances this season, but has been yellow carded in four of his last six.

If Chelsea avoid defeat in this game they will only be the fourth team to go unbeaten in their opening 15-plus games in a Premier League season (after Arsenal twice, Manchester United and Man City).

The Magpies are the only team yet to score in the opening 30 minutes of their league matches this season. Their earliest goal this season has come in the 37th minute.

Jose Mourinho could reach the 400-point landmark as a Premier League manager in this game (currently 398).
