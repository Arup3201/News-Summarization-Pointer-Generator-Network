Vladimir Putin has said that a war between Russian and neighbouring Ukraine is unlikely and that he hopes it 'never happens'.

Speaking to Russian state TV, the President called a military conflict between his country and Ukraine 'an apocalyptic scenario'.

This comes as an international security watchdog has warned of several breaches of the ceasefire agreed between Ukranian state troops and separatist rebels.

'I think that such an apocalyptic scenario [war] is unlikely and I
hope this will never happen,' he told a reporter with Russia
State TV company.

This weekend's prisoner swap between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels took place after Putin agreed to use his influence on the separatists during a conference call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko.

Today, Putin said he did not see the need for another meeting with the leaders of France, Germany and Ukraine on resolution of the conflict.

This follows a statement by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that although the current cease-fire has 'very significantly' lowered the level of military exchanges in Ukraine, violations are still taking place.

Lamberto Zannier, head of OSCE, said Monday there have been a number of violations in the south, and some limited incidents around the town of Debaltseve and around the Donetsk airport, both seized by separatists. 

Vladimir Putin, seen at a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier, during the 'Day of the Fatherland's Defender'-celebrations yesterday, said he 'did not see the need' for more peace meetings

Zannier called the agreed ceasefire 'the best chance ... to de-escalate and bring this conflict to an end,' but he stressed that 'there is work to be done.'

Today, Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine said they have begun a large-scale pullback of heavy weapons in line with the peace plan.

The claim by Eduard Basurin, a top rebel commander, couldn't immediately be confirmed. 

Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the observer mission that is monitoring the fighting in eastern Ukraine, said he couldn't comment until receiving monitors' reports at the end of the day.

The peace plan that was signed February 15  calls for heavy weapons to be pulled back by each side from the front line by 25 to 70 kilometers (15 to 45 miles), depending on their caliber.

The cease-fire has been troubled by violations, leading to concern that it wouldn't solidify and that fighting would continue. 

A rebel website cited Basurin as saying about 100 122-mm howitzers would be moved on Tuesday.

There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian side, but military officials have said that they won't pull back weapons until a cease-fire fully takes hold.

On Tuesday, military spokesman Lt. Col. Anatoliy Stelmakh said rebels had shelled the town of Popasna seven times and launched one barrage on the village of Luhanske.

Stelmakh also said rebels tried to storm Ukrainian positions near the southern village of Shyrokyne, which is near the strategic Azov Sea port of Mariupol. 

Concerns persists that rebels aim to take Mariupol to help establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed last March.
