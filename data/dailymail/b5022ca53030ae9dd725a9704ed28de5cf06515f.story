A paralysed schoolboy who can only communicate with his eyes has written a Christmas song by blinking. 

Adam Bojelian, 12, who has cerebral palsy, wrote the song with the help of mother Zoe, 52, who painstakingly pointed at letters until the festive track was complete.

The Edinburgh family have now made the song available on iTunes and it has already attracted celebrity backing including from Hollywood actor Ewan McGregor.

His delightful ditty, called the Christmas Gibbons, tells the story of how Santa only manages to deliver presents to children all over the globe in one night because he has an army of monkeys to help him out

The only movement cerebral palsy sufferer Adam can make is to move his eyelids up and down in answer to questions. A blink means yes and if he simply stares it means no

Based on Adam's poem called Christmas Gibbons, the song tells the story of how Santa can only deliver presents to children with the help of an army of monkeys.

Gibbons are fun at Christmas, They don't mind the snow,Gibbons are fun at Christmas,But there is something about them you don't know.They are Santa's secret weapon,They work on Christmas night,Swinging across the roof tops,They really are a sight. Bringing lots of presents,All around the world they go, More agile than the reindeers, Swinging to and fro. They are Santa's secret posties, Bringing gifts wrapped in paper and ribbons, You thought the reindeers did this job, Now you know it is the gibbons.

Mrs Bojelian said: 'Because it was a poem about Christmas, I made a list of festive words like snow and Santa and he would blink at the words he wanted to include.

'We'd gone through this process and had a whole load of Christmassy words and then I asked 'are all the words you want to use on your list?' and he said 'no'.'

Baffled, she then started to point to letters on an alphabet chart and Adam carefully selected G followed by I.

'I thought the word must be "gift" but then he chose B and spelled out the word GIBBONS,' she added.

'Once he had all the words he needed he put them in order. It took him a week to write all the words for the poem.

'This year his health has been really bad and he was in the Rachel House Hospice for respite care and they asked him to think about what he would like for his Make A Wish.

'Most of his friends wanted to go to Disneyland or meet a celebrity but Adam wanted to make his poem about the gibbons into a Christmas song.'

Adam, of Edinburgh, was born with cerebral palsy and lost all movement at just 10-months-old.

When Mrs Bojelian, who is studying for a PhD in medical law, noticed that Adam would blink when she spoke to him she realised this was how he was trying to communicate.

As he got older and learnt to read she began to hold up an alphabet chart, pointing to letters, with Adam blinking when she pointed to the correct one.

The only movement Adam can make is to move his eyelids up and down in answer to questions. A blink means yes and if he simply stares it means no.

The laborious process can mean it can often take a day to write just one sentence.

His mother took him along to a poetry group at their local church and Adam wrote his first poem, aged nine.

When talented Adam won a poetry prize only a year later his mother suggested he wrote a festive poem to send out with the family's Christmas cards.

The touching poem, featuring a helpful gang of musician gibbons, has now been animated and released on iTunes for charity

It was only when the family, including father Paul, 51, were out for a walk in a local park with his beloved Parson's Jack Russell terrier, Charlie, that Adam's dream of making a song became reality.

The trio bumped into family friends Gary and Kim Harrison, and the two families got chatting about Adam's poem.

Now, thanks to the Harrison's son Tom, 23, a Hollywood music composer, who has worked on hit TV series CSI, Adam's poem has been turned into a song.

Actor Ewan McGregor said he 'loves the idea that Santa is assisted at Christmas by gibbons'

The musician, who is originally from Elgin, Scotland, said: 'Adam's story really moved me and when his mum told me it was Adam's Christmas wish for his poem to become a song, I just wanted to help make his dream come true.

'He's really inspiring. Despite all his difficulties, Adam was able to create something so wonderful.

'Because Adam's poem was so beautifully written and rhymed well, it only took me about three hours to compose the music to go with the words.

'It then took me about a week to record the track and I played all the instruments, including the piano and acoustic guitar, flute and bells.'

Animator Nikki Godley was then recruited to create a video cartoon to accompany the single which is being sold on iTunes to raise money for CHAS, a charity that runs children's hospices in Scotland.

McGregor, a supporter of the charity, said he was bowled over when he heard Christmas Gibbons, saying: 'It’s quite incredible to think that Adam shares his vivid imagination with is through poetry written by blinking.

'I love the idea that Santa is assisted at Christmas by gibbons! I hope lots of people will download this track and help raise money for CHAS.'

When the families finally showed Adam his song they said he was 'over the moon.'

Christmas Gibbons is available on iTunes, with 50p going to charity.
