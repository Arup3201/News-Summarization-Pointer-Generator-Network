A new federal rule has prompted schools across America to serve an extra $5.4 million worth of fruit and vegetables to children each day, but that doesn't mean they're going to eat it.

Infact, there are findings that suggest about $3.8 million of that produce will be thrown in the trash.

However U.S. researchers suggest that paying students small amounts of money or handing out prizes in cafeteria increases the number who ate pieces of fruit and veg at lunch.

What to choose? U.S. researches say small rewards offered in the lunchroom will increase the consumption of fruit and veg among children by 80 per cent

According to Breitbart, Scientists conducted a study to measure of such small rewards in the lunchroom by giving nickels, quarters and raffle tickets only to the kids who ate the healthy snacks on offer.

The findings, published in The Journal of Human Resources, showed fruit and veggie consumption increased by 80 per cent, while waste food dropped by 33 per cent.

Some 15 schools were canvassed for the study.

'Parents are often misguided about incentives,' said Joe Price, an economics professor at Brigham Young University and one of the study's researchers.

'We feel a sense of dirtiness about a bribe. But rewards can be really powerful in the activity creates a new skill or changes preferences.'

Some fear prizes will prevent children from developing their own motivation to eat things that are good for them, while others fear the boomerang effect -- children eating less fruit and vegetables when the rewards disappeared, the researchers explained.

Price measured fruit and vegetable consumption before and after the week-long experiments. When the week of prizes ended, students went back to the same level of fruit and vegetable consumption as before - no lasting improvement, but no boomerang effect either, the study said.

The researchers are studying whether extending the experiments over three to five weeks might yield lasting change.

'I don't think we should give incentives such a bad rap,' said Price.

'They should be considered part of a set of tools we can use.'

The study was inspired by a new federal rule prompting schools across America to serve an extra $5.4 million worth of fruit and vegetables to children each day, in an attempt to make kids more healthy
