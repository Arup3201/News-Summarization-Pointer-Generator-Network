As Sergio Aguero fired Manchester City into a 3-0 lead against Liverpool on Monday, the Argentine striker achieved the record for the best scoring rate for a player with a minimum of 15 goals in Premier League history.

Aguero had only been on the field for 23 seconds before he sprinted onto a through ball from Jesus Navas to score his second goal in as many Premier League games.

The 26-year-old now tops an impressive list of some of the Premier League's finest ever strikers with 54 goals every 113 minutes on the pitch.

Player                        Goals    Mins per goal

Sergio Aguero              54                 113

Thierry Henry              175                122      

Ruud van Nistelrooy     95                 128

Javier Hernandez         37                  130

Robin van Persie        134                 135

Edin Dzeko                  46                  137

Daniel Sturridge          58                  138

Luis Suarez                 69                  139

Manuel Pellegrini seems to be tapering Aguero's return to first team action as he nurses the injury-prone forward back to full fitness after a busy summer which saw Argentina reach the World Cup final in Brazil.

Pellegrini's decision to use Aguero from the bench for the first two Premier League games of the season looks to be a wise one as the former Atletico Madrid man has knotched against Newcastle and Liverpool. 

If Aguero can carry on at the scoring rate, there's no doubt that he'll beat his goalscoring record of the 2013/14 Premier League season which saw the diminutive striker score 15 goals in 23 league appearance for City. 

Aguero knocked Arsenal legend Thierry Henry off the top of the list as his record pips the Frenchman's stunning return of 175 goals every 122 Premier League minutes.

Talisman: Ruud van Nistelrooy scored 95 goals every 128 minutes for Manchester United

Former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy sits in third place with 95 goals every 128 minutes before eventually reaching 150 goals in total for his club.

Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge could soon trouble Aguero for top spot in the best scoring rate charts with a current tally of 58 goals every 138 minutes.

City can boast two names in the top eight of the Premier League strikers with the best minutes-per-goal record as Bosnian forward Edin Dzeko also claims a place with 46 goals every 137 minutes on the field.
