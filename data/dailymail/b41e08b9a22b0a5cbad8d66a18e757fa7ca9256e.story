After a successful race weekend in Italy Lewis Hamilton is looking to have a big week in the gym as he prepares for the World Championship run-in.

With six races to go Hamilton trails his teammate Nico Rosberg by 22 points in the drivers standings, having narrowed the gap with a win in Monza on Sunday.

And it seems the 2008 World Champion is trying to get the edge over his rival by building himself up in the gym. 

Posing: Hamilton posted this picture to his Instagram account announcing he wanted to put on weight

Pressure: Hamilton puts pressure on his teammate Rosberg to force an error which changed the race

Hamilton posted to his Instagram account: 'Trying to get my weight back up a little.....currently 1kg up.....let's get it!! #noflexzone #timetoworkout'

Drivers can lose around 4kg during a Grand Prix and although much of that is replenished soon after, Hamilton is clearly trying to make sure he is as strong as possible for future races.  

Fighting: Hamilton and Rosberg are competing for the Championship with six races to go
