That photo which led to the sacking of Cronulla Shark Tod Carney on Sunday

Sacked NRL star Todd Carney could only muster the courage to text his disappointed mother, Leanne, following his now infamous 'bubbler' incident and explain how sorry he was about that lewd image which led to his sacking at the Cronulla Sharks.

Speaking with Fairfax Media, Carney said he was so upset about the impact the incident has had on his mother, that he couldn't stomach the courage to speak to her about it and instead the pair traded text messages.

But it is now understood the pair have spoken for the first time since Carney's sacking on Sunday, and said he said his mother is doing 'OK.' 'I know I hurt mum, I know I hurt plenty of people, the kids who support me. I let them down,' the 29-year-old told Fairfax Media.

Todd and his mother Leanne have spoken for the first time since his sacking on Sunday and his said, despite her disappointment, she is doing 'OK.'

One week on from his sacking, Carney is still in training unsure of what his future holds in rugby league.

His mother said he is yet to make a decision on his future, or whether he would look to pursue a career in the UK or elsewhere.

But she told The Sunday Telegraph it was unlikely he would go down that path. 'No, I don't think so, but he hasn't really made any decisions regarding his future yet,' she said.

Carney's contract was ripped up and his pride shot to pieces when the image of him standing at a urinal inside a Cronulla nightspot went viral on Twitter last Saturday.

He was dismissed by the Sharks on Sunday after the photo of him urinating into his own mouth leaked onto social media.

On Monday Carney spoke out about the shocking photo, explaining he didn't know it was 'out there' and hopes it doesn't end his football career.

'It’s just disappointing for something that I didn't know was out there, something that’s surfaced like this,' he told Nine News.

He explained he 'felt sick' when he found out the photo, which he said was just a 'prank', was being shared across the internet.

'To receive the message on Saturday night, it’s just gut-wrenching, it made me feel sick straight away,' he said on Monday.

Carney revealed he feels he's been 'betrayed' by his club after he asked for the chance to talk to his teammates and the board but was sacked before being given the opportunity to explain.

Carney was a Canberra Raider and Sydney Rooster before he signed a contract with the Cronulla Sharks but all clubs terminated his tenure due to continued off-field indirections

And while news of Carney's sacking keeps reverberating off the field, on it, his former club have rallied in an inspiring come from behind win against the Sydney Roosters on Saturday night.

The Sharks pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in the club's 47-year history after a hellish week that claimed their star player.

The embattled side ended the week with a win against the premiers coming from 24-0 with only half an hour on the clock to triumph over the Sydney Roosters 30-28 in the boil over of the season at Sydney's Allianz Stadium on Saturday.

It came not only after Carney's sensational departure, but the resignation of their coach Peter Sharp who resigned two days after.

Stand-in Sharks captain Wade Graham said after the win: 'I saw some odds in the paper. What were we - 50 to one or something? It was ridiculous. No one gave us a hope.'

'The funny thing about rugby league players is that most of them have a little bit of attitude and, if you write them off, they like to step up to the mark and say I told you so.

'It was just a super effort from the boys.'
