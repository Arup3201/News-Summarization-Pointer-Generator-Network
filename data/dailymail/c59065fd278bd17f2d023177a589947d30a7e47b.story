Amid the quagmire of saccharine Christmas adverts starring penguins, fairies and down-trodden mums, a German supermarket has produced a video bound to raise a smile.

Using thirteen cameras, nine cashiers at an Edeka store in Germany were filmed treating unassuming shoppers to an interesting rendition of Jingle Bells. 

The video clip begins with befuddled customers looking impatient as the supermarket staff scan various items at their check outs.

But soon the lights are dimmed and the shop workers scan in unison to create the festive melody.

The famous tune starts to ring out along with a festive light show created by the green and red flashing tills. 

The shoppers warm up and soon everyone is bopping a long to the well-known Christmas song.
