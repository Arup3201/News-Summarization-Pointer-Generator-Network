Nothing to hide: Angela Rippon steps out in leather trousers and knee high boots

She flashed her long and shapely pins for the first time when she ventured out from behind the newsdesk and danced on the Morecombe & Wise show. And almost 40 years on Angela Rippon is only too happy to continue to show them off in one of her favourite outfits: leather trousers and knee high boots.

Some would say her attire was an unconventional choice for a woman who celebrated her 70th birthday only a few days ago but then Miss Rippon has never been afraid to break the mould.

The veteran TV presenter, who will always be known as much for her ability to high kick as for her ground breaking role as the BBC’s first female news anchor, appeared in her racy outfit at a furnishing launch for GPlan Upholstery earlier this month.

She admitted last year she had made a pact to ‘grow old disgracefully’ following her 50th birthday. At the time she said: ‘I decided when I was 50 that I was going to grow old disgracefully and I’m keeping to it,’ she said.

‘I was at a lunch and we talked about the fashion police dictating that women of a certain age shouldn’t wear black leather trousers or knee-high suede boots. Well, knickers to that. I’ve got black leather trousers and I wear suede boots up to my knees and beyond.

‘I shall wear what I feel good in and frankly that’s my choice and nobody else’s business. So, I’ll grow old disgracefully by just being me and continuing to get the most out of life.’

Miss Rippon became BBC1’s face of the Nine O’Clock News in 1975, the first female journalist to present the programme on a permanent basis.

Then in 1976, she stunned the nation by appearing on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas special and showing off her high-kick dancing credentials with a spectacular pair of legs.
