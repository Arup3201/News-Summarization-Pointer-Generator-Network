A proposed ‘amnesty’ for those suspected of scores of unsolved murders during the Northern  Ireland Troubles provoked a  furious backlash last night.

Relatives of those killed in the  30-year conflict reacted furiously to a call to halt further inquests and other state investigations into the crimes committed before the 1998 Good  Friday peace agreement was signed.

John Larkin QC, the Attorney General in Northern Ireland, insisted his proposals did not amount to an amnesty. But he said he felt the time had come to halt prosecutions.

No prosecutions: Killings carried out during the Troubles should no longer be investigated, the Northern Ireland attorney general has said. Here British soldiers examine an armoured Land Rover which was damaged during a grenade attack in 1997

Yesterday
Colin Parry, whose 12-year-old son Tim was killed when the IRA bombed 
Warrington 20 years ago, said Mr Larkin’s call was ‘highly insensitive’.

‘The
problem for me, and I guess for the vast majority of victims who have 
never had anybody prosecuted or arrested for the offence they committed,
is that they will feel – as I do – that they have been  forgotten and 
abandoned and the matter is just being filed away,’ Mr Parry, 66, told 
BBC Radio 5 Live.

‘If by 
chance some evidence were to pop out of the ether at some point in the 
future, or somebody was to provide some inside information anonymously, 
the prospect of there being an investigation and an arrest and possible 
prosecution would exist, whereas if the Attorney General’s proposition 
is supported and applied then that would not be possible.’

Stephen
Gault, whose father Samuel was killed in the 1987 IRA Poppy Day bombing
in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, said he was disgusted. ‘How dare he  
airbrush the innocent people who were murdered at the hands of 
terrorists to move things forward,’ he said.

Mickey
McKinney, whose brother William was killed by soldiers on Bloody Sunday
in Londonderry in 1972, called Mr Larkin’s proposal ridiculous.

Conflict: Riots in Belfast following the death of IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in 1981. The announcement that deaths prior to 1998 will not be investigated has sparked anger

The
police are currently re-investigating Bloody Sunday, with  relatives of
those killed having  long campaigned for the soldiers  allegedly 
involved to be prosecuted. The 1998 Omagh bomb, which happened after the
Good Friday Agreement was signed, would not be  covered by Mr Larkin’s 
suggestion.

He told the BBC:
‘More than 15 years have passed since the  Belfast Agreement, there 
have been very few prosecutions, and every competent criminal lawyer 
will tell you the prospects of conviction diminish, perhaps 
exponentially, with each passing year, so we are in a position now where
I think we have to take stock.

Reaction: Former Northern Ireland Secretary of State Peter Hain described the proposals as 'commonsense'

‘It
strikes me that the time has come to think about putting a line, set at
Good Friday 1998, with respect to prosecutions, inquests and other 
inquiries.’ He said crimes of the past would remain crimes but ‘it would
simply be that no criminal proceedings would be possible’ with respect 
to them.

Michael Gallagher, 
whose son Aiden was killed in the August 1998 Real IRA attack in Omagh, 
which claimed 29 lives, said the attorney general was sending out a 
totally wrong message to terrorists. Dissident republicans have murdered
two soldiers, two policemen and a prison officer in the last five 
years. ‘He is saying, “If you murder enough people, the Government will 
make a deal with you and you will eventually get off”,’ said Mr 
Gallagher.

Ruling out an amnesty, David Cameron told the Commons it would be ‘rather dangerous’ to block possible future prosecutions.

Former
US diplomat Dr Richard Haass is trying to achieve political consensus 
on a number of issues as yet unresolved during the peace process – one 
of which is how the province addresses the legacy of  its violent past 
and the seemingly endless unanswered questions over killings carried out
by all sides.

Mr Larkin outlined his controversial proposals in a submission to Dr Haass.

The Claudy Bombing (Bloody Monday) IN 1972 the IRA exploded three car bombs in quick succession in the main street of Claudy, a village in Co Londonderry, killing nine. Among the dead was nine-year-old Kathryn Eakin. She had been playing outside her family’s shop.

Whitecross/Gilford MassacresSix Roman Catholic men were shot dead in 1976 in their rural homes in South Armagh, reportedly by members of the security forces operating under the guise of the loyalist UVF. All the victims were exonerated of involvement in terrorism. The IRA retaliated the next day with the…
