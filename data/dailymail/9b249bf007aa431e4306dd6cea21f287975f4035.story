Returning Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has been warned he has to handle the pressure if he wants to be a success at Anfield.

Mignolet is poised to make his first Liverpool start for three weeks on Monday night against Swansea having been axed by Rodgers following the club’s Champions League exit three weeks ago.

The 26-year-old Belgian has faced heavy criticism this season but has won a reprieve because of a thigh injury picked up by rival keeper Brad Jones at Burnley on Boxing Day.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has told Mignolet he must learn to deal with the pressure 

Rodgers is aware Mignolet will be under the spotlight after a nervy cameo as a substitute at Turf Moor which included misjudging a clearance so the ball ran over the goal-line for a corner.

But the Liverpool boss says his players have little choice but to accept being under the spotlight at such a big club.

‘Like everyone, Simon has had a wee bit of flak. But to operate at this level, you have to be able to deal with that,’ said Rodgers.

‘He came on against Burnley and had a couple of edgy moments, and he will recognise that. But it will help his confidence to keep a clean sheet. That is what he wants as a goalkeeper and what we want as a team.

‘This is an opportunity for Simon to prove his worth.’

At the other end, Raheem Sterling — currently playing as Liverpool’s main striker — has been set a target of scoring 15 goals this season by Rodgers.

Sterling is filling in for Daniel Sturridge while Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggle for goals and scored the winner at Burnley for his sixth goal of the season, having netted 10 times last term.

‘He knows his job is to create goals and score goals and he’s doing very well at the moment,’ said Rodgers.

‘Between 10 and 15 would be a good return for him. The boy is a natural winger and if he gets those figures on a regular basis it’s a very good number for him.

‘You’ve other players who are out-and-out No 9s but as his career matures I think he will show he’s got that ability.’

Kolo Toure also believes Sterling will blossom into a top striker over the coming years — and stay at Anfield.

Sterling has two-and-a-half years left on his current £35,000 per week deal but Liverpool have been in talks with his advisors about offering him improved terms to reward the outstanding progress he has made.

There have been some reports that Liverpool’s offer is not what Sterling’s advisors feel he is worth, but Toure is not concerned.

The Ivorian said: ‘I’ve been lucky to play with some of the best strikers in the world and I can say Raheem has all the qualities to be up there.

‘Technically he has top quality. I don’t think the things being said about whether he will sign a new contract will affect him. I also don’t think it will be about money. Raheem will make a decision based on what he feels is right.

‘I think he will stay because he has been so well looked after at Liverpool.’

Monday night’s clash with Swansea will pit Rodgers against two players Liverpool might have signed — Gylfi Sigurdsson and Wilfried Bony.

Swansea skipper Ashley Williams has also been linked with a move to Anfield and Rodgers said: ‘He is a top-class international centre half.’
