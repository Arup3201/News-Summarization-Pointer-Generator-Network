He is known for his occasional forays into avant-garde fashion, but even for David Beckham sporting a roll of clingfilm seems an unusual choice.

The 37-year-old former England captain was pictured after being substituted during LA Galaxy's clash with San Jose Earthquakes with a clingfilm-like material around his abdomen.

Treatment: It is thought the clingfilm could be used to hold an ice pack, cold gel or heat rub in place

Sam Wilde, director of physiotherapy at 
Pure Sports Medicine, said: 'It is often used on rugby and football 
players when they come off the pitch after they’ve had a knock.

'It is very much like clingfilm and is used to keep an icepack in place – it's reasonably comfortable to wear.'

'It can also be used to keep heat 
rubs and cold gels in place – it works well because it keeps the 
temperature consistent,’ said Larry Koyama, physiotherapist at Exercise 
and Rehab.

Beckham was 
wrapped up after he was withdrawn during the game which Galaxy 3-1.

He was also substituted with ten 
minutes left in a game on Sunday, which ended in a shock 1-0 home defeat to San Jose.

It has been rumoured the 37-year-old star is not expected to renew his one-year rolling contract with the club, which comes to an end on December 31.

He is reportedly set to quit the team and may move to New York so his wife can pursue her fashion career.

But sources close to the former Manchester United midfielder - who moved to the US from Real 
Madrid in 2007 - said he has no plans to 
retire from football.

But
it is understood he and his wife Victoria, 38, are considering a move 
to New York with sons Brooklyn, 13, Romeo, ten, Cruz, seven and 
16-month-old daughter Harper.

This week Beckham was asked if he had another season in him, two years shy of turning 40.

‘Who
knows?’ he said. ‘I’m going to enjoy being in the play-offs... and then
we’ll see how this body feels. Even when I stop playing, I’ll have a 
hunger to do something better and be the best.’
