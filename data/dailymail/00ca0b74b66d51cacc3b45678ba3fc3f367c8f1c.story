Scottish scientists have developed synthetic speech to make it easier for people to hear public announcements in crowded, noisy places like railway stations

Everyone has been stuck in an airport or train station terminal listening out for critical announcements, only to find it is almost impossible to understand the booming voice that erupts from the public address system.

But these annoying messages could become a thing of the past as Scottish scientists have developed synthetic speech to make it easier for people to hear public announcements in crowded, noisy places.

Researchers have come up with a system that they claim make announcements quieter and clearer by creating software that can alter speech before it is broadcast over speakers.

The study, led by the University of Edinburgh, looked into how speech is heard by listeners to improve upon the synthetic voice technology currently used.

Dr Cassia Valentini Botinhao, from the university's School of Informatics, said: 'Noisy environments make it difficult to 
understand what is being said and simply making speech louder isnâ€™t the 
smartest solution.'

'Our findings could offer an alternative, by making speech more intelligible without turning up the volume.'

Researchers carried out tests to pinpoint the components of speech that are most easily heard by people in a noisy place.

They found that in loud environments, listeners pay most attention to the parts of speech that are the clearest and easiest to hear, in order to fill in the gaps and decipher the whole content of a message.

The scientists developed a mathematical computer program to analyse spoken word and enhance and clarify sounds that listeners pick up on the most, in a bid to make messages easier to understand overall.

Testing the system, they discovered that listeners found the manipulated speech easier to understand than natural speech and in some cases the improvement was equivalent to lowering noise volume by five decibels.

The scientists believe the research could also be used to improve smartphone voices and announcements on sat nav systems.

The study was carried out with scientists from Greece, Spain and Sweden and the findings presented at the Interspeech conference in Lyon.
