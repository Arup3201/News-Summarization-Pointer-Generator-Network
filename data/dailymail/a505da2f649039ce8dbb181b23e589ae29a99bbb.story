The developer that bought Television Centre from the BBC in 2012 is renting it back to the Corporation for £6.35million a year.

The BBC finally left the building in March despite bitter opposition from many of its own stars, including Michael Parkinson and comedian David Mitchell.

It justified the move by claiming it would make a profit of £78million from the sale and save on running costs of £30million a year.

Old home: The BBC left Television Centre back in March to move to Broadcasting House

Costly: But it is leasing back the old building for £6.35million a year while it works to decommission it

But bosses admitted yesterday it will continue to rent Television Centre for two years from the property firm Stanhope because it needs access to decommission the site and remove vital broadcasting equipment.

Last night critics said paying an extra £12.7million for a vacant property in West London made little commercial sense and questioned why the BBC was also paying to clear up the site.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘I cannot see why the BBC is paying £6million of licence fee-payers’ money to a developer for an empty building, and at the same time paying the developer’s clean-up costs.

‘This looks like another example of bad stewardship of public money by the BBC.

‘It has been suggested to me that the BBC is being forced to sell and then rent back some of its properties to fill the financial black hole left by the construction of New Broadcasting House, its lavish new central London HQ.’

New home: The BBC moved to New Broadcasting House five miles away

The BBC has already admitted it will rent back a ‘significant part’ of the 14-acre site, even though it has spent more than £1billion revamping Broadcasting House just five miles away in Central London.

This was despite assurances when Television Centre was first put on the market in 2007. At the time, the BBC said: ‘This is a full-scale disposal and we won’t be leasing it back.’

In fact, the BBC will pay £3.6million a year from 2015 to rent three studios. The cost will be covered by the BBC’s commercial subsidiaries rather than from the licence fee.

In addition, it will pay an estimated £60million removing broadcasting equipment, satellite aerials and circuits from Television Centre over the next two years.

It is believed the high cost is driven by the difficulty of completing the move without disrupting normal TV service. The costs mean the BBC risks losing its overall profit on the sale.

Mr Wilson added: ‘The profit the BBC claims to have made on the sale of Television Centre will be all but wiped out by the costs of transferring and replacing equipment.

‘I suspect the BBC will end up making a loss once the amount paid by the developer is whittled down by such hidden costs.’

Stanhope paid £200million for a 999-year lease on the site last July. It plans to develop a hotel, office space, leisure facilities and up to 1,000 apartments.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Television Centre is not empty. There is vital technology and equipment without which we could not broadcast.

'The short-term cost of unavoidable decommissioning work is more than offset by the savings that moving will deliver. In addition to the profit on the sale, the BBC will save £30million a year on running the site.’
