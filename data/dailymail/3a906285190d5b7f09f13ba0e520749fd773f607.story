Police in Portland, Oregon, received 
an unusual call earlier this month when a teenager phoned requesting 
assistance to deal with a ‘massive’ spider.

The caller, Makenna Sewell, wasn’t a prankster or someone with an extreme phobia of spiders, but instead suffers from muscular dystrophy and is wheelchair-bound.

She
believed the spider was a brown recluse, a species with venom so toxic 
that it could have been deadly for her compromised immune system.

Sewell was home alone on August 16 when she saw the creature, which she described as being about three inches across.

Just
a few days prior, her mom Shawnda had been bitten by a spider on the 
back of her leg during the night, which had resulted in a nasty wound 
and a trip to the emergency room.

Initially Sewell tried to call her mother, her father, the friends her parents were with, her own friends and two neighbors.

When she couldn’t reach anyone, Sewell decided to call the non-emergency police hotline as a last resort.

Makenna Sewell said she felt silly calling police to kill the spider, but said she legitimately feared for her safety

Makenna, who has muscular dystrophy, said she was afraid that the spider - which she believed to be a deadly venomous brown recluse - would harm her or little brother

The audio from her police call reveals a rather comical scene.

'I'm
home alone and there is a giant spider on the back of my couch, and I'm
talking giant. I've never seen a spider this big and I have no idea 
what to do,' she told the slightly perplexed operator.

The teen estimated the spider was the size of a baseball and said it was appeared similar to a tarantula.

She
told the dispatcher that she generally wasn't fazed by spiders, but a 
family member was recently bitten by one and had to go to the hospital.

She also explained that she had initially tried to get hold of her parents but failed.

'I
don't know if you guys have anything I can do, or if I just sit here 
and stare at it and wait for someone to get home to kill it,' she asked.

The
dispatcher is heard telling her that since she doesn't feel safe, he 
will send someone over to her house. In the end, a total of four police 
officers showed up at their house.

When
the officers arrived at the home, they reported finding a spider that 
was about two inches in diameter and they quickly disposed of it with an
old-fashioned rolled up newspaper.

Throughout the situation, Sewell said the officers remained professional, despite the seemingly absurd circumstances.

A
student at Forest Grove High School in a suburb of Portland, Sewell 
admits she felt silly calling the police department to kill a spider - 
but she insists it really was a danger to her and her brother.

'Just
seeing a spider that big and knowing what it did to my immune system 
and me having a compromised immune system and a younger brother, I just 
knew that it wasn't good and I had to call someone,' Sewell told KPTV.

Though
it's not standard protocol for them to respond to a call about a 
spider, Forest Grove police said they decided to help the young lady out
in this instance.

Makenna
said they insisted she keep the dead spider and send it in for testing -
because they had never seen one that big, either.

She
also said she feels grateful that she lives in the sort of town where a
teenager can summon a police officer to kill a spider.

Dangerous: Brown recluse spiders, like the one pictured, are very venomous and can even kill bite victims - though they are seldom aggressive
