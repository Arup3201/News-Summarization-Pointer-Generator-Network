Situated behind iron railings on a strip of barren scrub land, the pokey Georgian house looks rather out of place in London's fashionable Southwark Street.

But even more unusual is the fact the property - a stone's throw away from the bustling Borough market - has been slowly melting. 

The two-floor property is actually an art installation made of wax bricks. After standing firm since September 26, the creation is dissolving into a pile of sludge and will be removed tomorrow. 

Entitled A Pound Of Flesh For 50p (The Melting House), was the brainchild of British artist and designer Alex Chinneck, who is well known for creating optical illusions.

He constructed the artwork (whose name is a nod to a line from The Merchant Of Venice) from 8,000 cast paraffin wax bricks 'cemented' between terracotta sand.

The house has been melted manually with heating tools used by the building trade to enable the artist maintain control over how it dissolves.

He built it in homage to a candle-making factory that stood in the area more than 100 years ago.

Over the last 12 months, Mr Chinneck has liaised with engineers and wax specialists to make the brickwork look as convincing as possible. 

The sculpture was part of Merge Festival, an annual series of art, music and performances that draws on the heritage and culture of the capital’s Bankside.
