It is a problem that has left many men the subject of jokes and caused upset for women.

But now those suffering from hair loss and baldness could finally have an answer to their prayers - without resorting to a comb-over, toupee or hair transplant.

A new hair product on sale in salons from this week claims to not only stop hair loss, but also stimulate new growth.

The treatment Kérastase Densifique, which has been hailed as a ‘major breakthrough’, stimulates the scalp to wake up dormant follicles.

Baldness cure: A new hair loss treatment claims to stimulate growth by waking up dormant follicles on the scalp

Scientists have found that many of those suffering from hair loss or balding have skin tissue in the scalp that has an oxygen deficiency – a condition called hypoxia.

They have developed a molecule called stemoxydine that targets this condition by attempting to increase oxygen levels in the scalp.

The increase aims to help follicles to produce thicker hair and stimulate hair growth in areas where the follicles have shut down.

The Kérastase Densifique cream, which costs £285 for a three-month treatment, is applied to the hair daily.

It is put into damp or dry hair using an applicator and then massaged into the scalp.

The maker L’Oreal, which developed it in its hair laboratory in Paris, claim that it is clinically proven to be effective for both men and women.

In a study, 101 people who used the product once a day for three months found a four per cent increase in the number of hairs they had, which represent an average of 1,700 new hairs.

Patricia Pineau, head of scientific affairs at L’Oréal, said: ‘We’ve known for 100 years that hair grows and falls out.  We haven’t known what makes hair regenerate until now.

‘It is all about hair stem cell environment. In 2000, we have published the existence of two stem cell reservoirs in the hair and, more recently, we have both identified the optimal environment and designed a molecule able to favour it.

‘Kérastase Densifique is a result of this discovery that happens not very often. We have been able to develop a cosmetic product that respects the natural way hair regenerates.

‘A clinical trial has proven its efficacy on hair density - number and diameter. Kérastase Densifique will really help people who are experiencing thinning hair and less volume.’

Hairdresser and Kérastase Ambassador Luke Hersheson added: ‘It’s set to be the holy grail for a lot of women – and men.’
