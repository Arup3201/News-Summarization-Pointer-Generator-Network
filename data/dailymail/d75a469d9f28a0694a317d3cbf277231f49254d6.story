FBI director James Comey is calling Apple's new privacy features a boon to kidnappers, pedophiles, and terrorists. 

New encryption standards for iPhones and iPads requiring a key to unlock text messages, pictures, and emails 'put people beyond the law,' Comey claimed in a recent interview.

With the new technology, a text message is scrambled on Apple's servers and can only be decrypted with the receiver's iPhone password, preventing law enforcement from getting the data from Apple.

Google is following suit on Android phones.

Comey voiced his concerns in an interview with 60 minutes.  

'The notion that people have devices... that with court orders, based on a showing of probable cause in a case involving kidnapping or child exploitation or terrorism, we could never open that phone? My sense is that we've gone too far when we've gone there,' Comey said.

He compared encrypted iPhones to 'cars with trunks that couldn't ever be opened by law enforcement with a court order.'

But as CNN Money points out, it's a problematic comparison.

The FBI can still get phone data if they get a warrant or a federal court order forcing you to turn your phone over to them.

Plus making messages easily accessible to law enforcement would also mean making them easily accessible to hackers looking to steal your information. 

New York attorney Joel Kurtzberg told CNN Money that the only real change with Apple's new guidelines is it forces law enforcement to be open about seeking data.

'This is going to make it harder for law enforcement,' said Kurtzberg, who specializes in First Amendment cases. 'And it will result in instances where someone will destroy evidence.'
