‘He would be a brilliant signing for Strictly. The fact that he is known for his forthright views is a bonus.’

A Liverpool legend and former Scotland international, Hansen has worked on Match of the Day since 1992, having retired from playing in 1991.

He would join a long list of sporting stars to have appeared on Strictly, including former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan and ex-Wales international midfielder Robbie Savage.
