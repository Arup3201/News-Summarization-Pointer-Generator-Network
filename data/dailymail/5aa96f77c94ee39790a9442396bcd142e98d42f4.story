It could help us find Earth like planets - and even spot a 'second Earth'.

High in the Chilean desert, the Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) has begun automatically scanning the skies

The project is a wide-field observing system made up of an array of twelve telescopes, each with an aperture of 20 centimetres.

The Next-Generation Transit Survey is made up of an array of twelve 20cm telescopes, and will focus on discovering Neptune-sized and smaller planets, with diameters two and eight times that of Earth.

It will search for transiting exoplanets — planets that pass in front of their parent star and hence produce a slight dimming of the star's light that can be detected by sensitive instruments.

The telescopes will focus on discovering Neptune-sized and smaller planets, with diameters between two and eight times that of Earth.

The new facility, built by a UK, Swiss and German consortium, is located at ESO's Paranal Observatory in northern Chile and benefits from the superb observing conditions and excellent support facilities available at this site.

The telescope has now achieved first light.

'We needed a site where there were many clear nights and the air was clear and dry so that we could make very accurate measurements as often as possible — Paranal was the best choice by far,' says Don Pollacco of the University of Warwick in the UK and one of the NGTS project leads.

The telescopes are designed to operate in a robotic mode and it will continuously monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of comparatively bright stars in the southern skies.

It is searching for transiting exoplanets and will reach a level of accuracy in measuring the brightness of stars — one part in a thousand — that has never before been attained with a ground-based wide-field survey instrument. 

The telescopes are designed to operate in a robotic mode and it will continuously monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of comparatively bright stars in the southern skies.

The discoveries of NGTS will be studied further using other larger telescopes, including the ESO Very Large Telescope. 

One goal is to find small planets that are bright enough for the planetary mass to be measured. 

This will allow planetary densities to be deduced, which in turn provides clues about the composition of the planets. 

It may also be possible to probe the atmospheres of the exoplanets whilst they are in transit, researchers hope.

The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is a wide-field photometric survey designed to discover transiting exoplanets of Neptune-size and smaller around bright stars. 

NGTS will survey brighter stars than NASA's Kepler mission, and will therefore find the brightest exoplanets of Neptune and super-Earth size, providing the prime targets for characterization by telescopes such as the VLT, E-ELTand JWST. 

Bright targets provide the key to understanding planetary structure and evolution, as well as atmospheric composition.

NGTS is sited at the European Southern Observatory's Paranal Observatory in Chile, home of the VLT, which meets strict requirements for low water vapor and excellent photometric conditions. 

This is the first telescope project hosted, but not operated, by ESO on Paranal, and strengthens the synergy with ESO's telescopes. 

Before it was built, the ESO demonstrated all key technologies using a prototype system, which operated on La Palma during 2009 and 2010, and at the Observatoire de Geneve from 2012-14.

During the transit some of the star's light passes through the planet's atmosphere, if it has one, and leaves a tiny, but detectable, signature. 

So far only a few such very delicate observations have been made, but NGTS should provide many more potential targets. 

The NGTS data will flow into the ESO archive system and will be available to astronomers worldwide for decades to come.

Peter Wheatley, one of the NGTS project leads from the University of Warwick, concludes: 'We are excited to begin our search for small planets around nearby stars. 

The NGTS discoveries, and follow-up observations by telescopes on the ground and in space, will be important steps in our quest to study the atmospheres and composition of small planets such as the Earth.'

The discoveries of NGTS will be studied further using other larger telescopes, including the ESO Very Large Telescope.

 ESO operates three unique world-class observing sites in Chile: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. 

At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope, the world's most advanced visible-light astronomical observatory and two survey telescopes. VISTA works in the infrared and is the world's largest survey telescope and the VLT Survey Telescope is the largest telescope designed to exclusively survey the skies in visible light. 

ESO is a major partner in ALMA, the largest astronomical project in existence. And on Cerro Armazones, close to Paranal, ESO is building the 39-metre European Extremely Large Telescope, the E-ELT, which will become 'the world's biggest eye on the sky'.

The telescopes will focus on discovering Neptune-sized and smaller planets, with diameters between two and eight times that of Earth.
