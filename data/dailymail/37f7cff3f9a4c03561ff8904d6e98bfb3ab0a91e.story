A pro-Kremlin blogger has warned Russian dissidents who flee to Britain they are 'cheats and pawns' and could face a sticky end.

Nikolai Starikov was writing following the death in Britain of 44 year old whistleblower Alexander Perepilichny.

Businessman Perepilichny had been assisting Swiss prosecutors in a case of suspected high level money laundering by Russian officials, prompting fears that an 'invisible' poison could have been used to kill him.

The case is similar to that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who died after drinking tea poisoned with radioactive polonium six years ago in London.

Perepilichny was found dead outside his Surrey home last month and in-depth toxicological tests are being carried out.

In his latest blog, Mr Starikov warned that those who betray Russia become  'pawns in a complicated geopolitical game. And they die because they do not understand it'.

He suggested that Litvinenko was murdered not by those acting for the Russian secret services but by exiles in Britain. 

'This is what happened to Alexander Litvinenko who was killed by polonium according to an ‘order from Kremlin’ as our English 'partners' say, but more likely he was poisoned by thallium salt,' he said, pointing the finger at a well-known exile.

An author and journalist, Starikov is behind the 'Goebbels' Award' which goes to 'people who lie about, slander and vilify Russia'.

On the latest mysterious death, Starikov wrote that 'three years ago according to the best traditions of Russian cheats, Alexander Perepilichnyy escaped to England and applied for asylum'.

He then gave evidence to Swiss prosecutors against Russian officials. In a sinister phrase, Starikov said: 'In such situations the death is rarely occasional.'

He urged potential whistleblowers to 
keep quiet and stay at home. 'It is not just honourable to the honest 
patriot to love your Motherland more than personal selfish interests, 
but it is also very good for your health.'

One comment darkly warns Russians: 'Here are the best traditions of  British intelligence for you.'  

Alexander Perepilichny
was a fit, energetic businessman with no history of medical problems, 
when, it seems, he simply dropped dead in the one-acre grounds of his 
seven-bedroom home. Yet exactly how he died remains shrouded in 
mystery. 

His body was 
discovered by a member of his staff in the early evening. He had
last been seen out jogging that morning and was still in his running 
gear when he was found.

A 
post-mortem examination was carried out, which was inconclusive and forensic experts 
are carrying out further tests for traces of poison.

Amid growing fears among associates 
that this wealthy individual was the victim of a sophisticated 
professional assassin, forensic experts are working to identify any 
lethal substance in the dead man’s organs or bloodstream.

The extra tests were ordered — 
following a routine autopsy — after Surrey police were informed that the
dead man had fled from Russia to Britain three years ago and had turned
supergrass against members of a feared Russian crime syndicate.

Following the death it emerged that 
Perepilichny had been warned via a Russian police official that his name
was on a hit list discovered in the possession of a known Chechen 
hitman in Russia, who had details of his former addresses.

The
death comes six months after another Russian businessman was gunned 
down in broad daylight outside London’s Canary Wharf when a hitman 
sprayed him with bullets. 

One theory is that the businessman was shot because he knew too much about a 2009 gun attack on a Russian banker in Moscow.

Litvinenko
had fled to Britain with evidence that gangs linked to Russia’s 
leadership were plotting the murder of Boris Berezovsky, an oligarch 
who had fallen out with President Vladimir Putin. 

He fell ill after meeting a KGB officer and his associate at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square.

Dubbed
the Assassins’ Poison, polonium-210 is substance considered to be 
250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide. Toxicologists estimate 
that a dose the size of a grain of salt would be fatal. The substance 
used in the Litvinenko case was traced back to a Russian nuclear plant.

If
polonium or another toxin is found to have been used in the latest 
case, experts say it would not have been difficult to administer the 
substance: for example, a food delivery bound for the victim’s home 
could have been intercepted and tampered with.

The
effects of polonium can take hours or days to become apparent — though 
the poison can trigger a heart attack — and only specialised tests can 
discover traces of the substance, which rapidly diminish after death. 
What was particularly chilling in the wake of Litvinenko’s murder was 
the refusal of President Putin to hand over the prime suspect — the KGB 
man who was at the London hotel on the day in question. 

When
David Cameron went to Moscow last year and demanded the suspect be sent
to Britain, he was told bluntly: ‘That will never happen, no matter 
what the circumstances.’

Now,
with a Tory MP and a clutch of former Foreign Secretaries expressing 
increasing concern about Russian criminals operating in Britain, 
diplomatic relations between Moscow and London could plunge to an icy 
new low if the death in St George’s Hill proves to be murder.

In the coming days, all eyes will be on the results of the forensics being carried out at a Surrey police lab. 

Toxicology
specialists have been brought in to study blood and tissue samples 
after detectives learned the identity of the dead man. Certainly, Alexei
Navalny, a high-profile Russian anti-corruption campaigner, believes 
the latest death bears all the hallmarks of a professional hit.

‘He
died at the age of 44, which in general is not typical, and there were 
no signs of violent death. Well, Litvinenko didn’t have them either.’

Alexander Perepilichny could have died from natural 
causes, but there is much in his past that points to a more complex — 
and concerning — story. 

He
fled to Britain with his young wife Tanya, after 
falling out with members of a criminal network thought to include 
corrupt members of the Russian police, tax office, judiciary and 
government. 

At the time of
his death, he was providing information to Bill Browder, a wealthy 
British businessman who was the victim of the same crime network, which 
he says colluded in the hijacking of his Moscow investment company in 
order to carry out a massive fraud. Browder, 48, had been contacted by 
Perepilichny in the summer of 2010.

‘He provided us with documents 
proving the involvement of named Russian government officials in the 
fraud against my company,’ Browder has said.

These
explosive papers revealed names of those involved in the tax scam, 
including details of how they had used the cash they made to buy a 
£15 million Moscow estate, as well as multi-million-pound properties in 
Dubai and to set up a Swiss bank account containing millions. 

Many close to the case believe this revelation cost Perepilichny his life.
