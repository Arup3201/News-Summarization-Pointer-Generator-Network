Nico Rosberg has claimed that he drove off the track to avoid sustaining tyre damage in Sunday’s Italian Grand Prix amid conspiracy theorists believing the race was fixed by Mercedes.

Lewis Hamilton claimed his first win since July to narrow the gap to Rosberg in this most intense of title battles. But his cause was aided when his team-mate Rosberg missed the chicane at Turn One  which allowed Hamilton to pass.

It was claimed by fans on social media that the German, who had made a similar error earlier in the race, performed the faux pas on purpose to compensate for his collision with Hamilton at the previous race in Belgium.

Sir Jackie Stewart, a three-time world champion, and whose number of 27 race wins Hamilton surpassed with his Monza triumph, joined the sport’s fans in questioning Rosberg’s ‘gaffe’.

He said: ‘I thought, “hello, what’s going on here?”’ He could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he didn’t.’

But speaking from Ibiza in the video blog after Sunday’s race, Rosberg, 22 points ahead of Hamilton in the championship, claimed he ran off the circuit under pressure from his team-mate. 

‘I just messed up,’ said Rosberg. ‘Lewis was quick and I had to step up my game a little bit and tried to get that little bit extra out of it and I messed up.

‘I could have made the corner but the risk is so big that my front tyre would be square from the lock up, so the safer way, and the best way, and the only way was to go straight on so at least I would not have to do another pit stop and change tyres.’

Mercedes dismissed the notion that they had asked Rosberg to move aside for Hamilton as punishment for the German's collision with his rival in Spa. 

Indeed  they posted a satirical tweet accompanied with a picture of flying pigs (below) on Monday morning. 

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, who was seen smiling in the immediate aftermath of the incident on lap 29, laughed off claims Rosberg was under orders to throw the race in Monza.

'Only a paranoid mind could come up with such an idea,’ he said.

'The race at Monza was unlike many others I've seen with Nico because he rarely makes mistakes, but he made two in the same place,' said Wolff.

'There was lots of pressure on Nico because Lewis was so quick in qualifying, and you could see that again in the race.

'Mentally he is very strong, and if you want to be a world champion you have to go through lows and highs, and he's had many of them.

'We saw after what happened at Silverstone (retirement with a gearbox problem) he came back, so I guess he has the mental strength to recover from what happened in Italy.'
