We've seen Kraft swallow Cadbury and US chemist's Walgreens bid for Boots.

Now another British icon has fallen prey to a giant American corporation – after the London Eye was renamed the Coca-Cola London Eye.

The tourist attraction, which has become a symbol of the London skyline, now glows red at night rather than blue to mark the landmark's sponsorship deal with the fizzy drinks firm.

The London Eye shining red following the attraction's new sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola, which has seen the pods having the drink's branding inside

The deal was signed last September and the wheel began turning again over the weekend, following its annual closure for maintenance earlier this month.

Visitors were shocked to see that every pod of the Eye is now branded with its own Coca-Cola logo. Staff have been kitted out in red Coca-Cola uniforms – including Coca-Cola beanie hats for security workers – and the ticket office has been plastered with Coca-Cola posters.

The move left plenty of people seeing red yesterday, with the Eye's owners accused of selling out, and health campaigners criticising the decision to promote such a sugary drink. One can of Coca-Cola contains nine teaspoons of sugar. 

The maximum recommended daily intake of sugar is 30 teaspoons for men, 22.5 teaspoons for women and 21 for children.

Malcolm Clark, from the Children's Food Campaign, told The Observer: 'It's totally inappropriate for a major family attraction to be sponsored by a sugary drinks company.

'It sends completely the wrong message, not just here in London, but right across the globe. Soft drinks are the largest source of sugar in children and teenagers' diets, associated with weight gain and obesity, diabetes, heart disease and poor dental health.' 

Volunteers from the Children's Food Campaign were at the London Eye yesterday handing out 500 toothbrushes to families visiting the attraction 

The campaigners say that it is inappropriate that Coca-Cola, a sugary drinks firm should be sponsoring the London attraction 

Yesterday campaigners handed out 500 toothbrushes at the Eye to symbolise the 500 children who are admitted to hospital because of tooth decay every week.

The London Eye was sponsored by British Airways for the eight years after its launch in 2000. The airline was one of the original joint owners until the attraction was bought by Merlin Entertainments in 2005.

Yesterday Merlin Entertainments said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets.

But Dr John Middleton, vice-president at the Faculty of Public Health, said: 'Coca-Cola is the flagship for sugar marketing and therefore the flagship for rotten teeth and diabetes.They're taking over a high-visibility attraction and a major icon of the London landscape.'

He added: 'What next, Buckingham Palace sponsored by Coca-Cola? There needs to be a much bigger public debate about advertising control before commercial corporate interests infiltrate every aspect of the public landscape.'
