South Africa won the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens gold at Ibrox, beating four-time defending champions 17-12 in the final.

The All Blacks had never lost a single match in the course of winning their past four back-to-back titles in the event's 20-year history, but fell to defeat against the impressive Springboks.

Cecil Afrika scored the decisive try after Seabelo Senatla's double had turned around a half time 7-0 deficit.

Joe Webber dived over to keep New Zealand in it but Akira Ioane's touch forward left South Africa to boot the ball into touch to end one of the longest reigns in world sport.

New Zealand had not lost a Commonwealth match since the sport made its debut in 1998 and they looked to be heading for a fifth consecutive gold when Sherwin Stowers crossed in the first half.

But South Africa, who beat Samoa 35-7 to reach the final, came storming back to win.

'It could have gone either way,' New Zealand captain DJ Forbes said. 'They put pressure on us but we had a chance to win the game.

'But it didn't go to plan and that's rugby.

'We're happy with second best, so to speak. We are part of the legacy that has gone before us - we'd never been beaten.

'As a country we have a lot of chances to win medals but as a New Zealand rugby player it is disappointing to come second.'

Australia, who lost 19-7 to New Zealand in the semi-finals, beat Samoa 24-0 to win bronze.

Rugby will make its return to the Olympics in its abbreviated format in Rio in 2016.
