David Miscavige, the ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion, first announced plans to build an 'Ideal Advanced Organization and Continental Base for Australia and the Asiatic region' in October 

The Church of Scientology has spent millions of dollars purchasing land in Sydney for the development of an enormous new facility that will serve as an Asia Pacific headquarters for the religious group.

David Miscavige,  the Chairman of the Board ReligiousTechnology Center and ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion, announced the organisations plans to build an 'Ideal Advanced Organization and Continental Base for Australia and the Asiatic region' during a church celebration on October 17.

Mr Miscavige revealed the plan to build a '130 thousand square feet' facility overlooking Sydney's Lane Cove National Park to over 7500 guests, according to Scientology.org.

'Here, Scientologists from Tasmania to Tokyo will traverse the upper realms of the Bridge to Total Freedom.'

At least three properties in Chatswood West on Sydney's north shore have been purchased by the church for the new facility.

The sites, at 126 Greville Street, 23 and 25 Millwood Avenue, were bought up for over $37 million, according to News Limited.

The president of the Church of Scientology, Vicki Dunstan, confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that the organisation had purchased the sites.

Ms Dunstan said the new facility would provide 'more advanced theological studies' than those available at the existing Sydney church on Castlereagh Street. 

'The Church is developing a plan that allows for administrative functions, ancillary uses and theological studies for parishioners and staff. The site provides more advanced religious studies and services for existing members of the Church,' she said.

A development proposal for the sites on 126 Greville Street, 23 and 25 Millwood Avenue at Chatswood West in Sydney's north have been submitted to the local council

'In addition to providing spaces for Scientology religious services, the new site will house the management arm of the Church with offices which work on developing and running our community and social reform programs.'

However, Terry Fogarty, the Secretary of the Chatswood West Progress Association, told Daily Mail Australia that Willoughby City Council was unlikely to approve the organisation's development application until early 2015.

Prior to lodging their application a month ago, Mr Fogarty said that church members had informed local residents in the area of their development plans, and assured them 'that they're not door-knockers'.

'There will be no development on the site – they'll be doing an adaptive reuse of the existing building,' Mr Fogarty said.

'The building is something like a big concrete block building with massive walls and aromatic chambers at the bottom of the building, a big foyer area and a big auditorium.

'They said there will be three 40-seater buses that will be used to bring people from their residential facility in Dundas and the residential blocks will be used as bus drop-offs.'

'The feeling we have from residents is that it might be better than some of the other options that might occur on the site – originally it was going to be 350 units, but that got knocked back and reduced.' 

The headquarters will be open to the public as a place of worship from 8 am until about 9:30 pm each day, according to Mr Fogarty, but also be used for ecclesiastical teaching and office administration.

The third generation Scientologist received the International Association of Scientologists' Freedom Medal Award in a lavish two-day ceremony.

'It has taken a tribe to help keep the show on the road. And by that, I mean three generations of my family, all supporting the IAS and who will continue to do so until society has all the tools necessary to bring about sanity and an improved culture,' she said upon receiving her award.
