England are resigned to being without Brad Barritt and Geoff Parling for their RBS Six Nations opener against Wales and there are on-going doubts about two of their other casualties.

The national team’s injury crisis continues to rage on unchecked, with Wednesday's confirmation that Saracens centre Barritt and Leicester lock Parling will miss the trip to Cardiff next Friday. 

Those setbacks add to an absentee list which already features Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes.

But there may be further setbacks in the offing, as head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants await updates on the state of Tom Wood’s ankle and Kyle Eastmond’s shoulder. At this stage, the severity of the injuries hampering the Northampton flanker and Bath centre remain unclear, but they must be considered in grave danger of missing at least the clash with Wales.

Lancaster tried to adopt a positive tone at the tournament launch on Wednesday morning, saying: ‘The current situation is that Geoff Parling and Brad Barritt are in pretty good shape really. We don't anticipate the injuries will be any more than a couple of weeks really. We will see how they go over the next 24 hours but we are pretty optimistic about Geoff and Brad.

‘Tom Wood and Kyle Eastmond are going to have further assessments that are going to take place in the next 24 hours and we will have a bit more information on that after those assessments.’

Asked about the anticipated timescale for Barritt and Parling to back available again, he added: ‘Obviously the clock is ticking for the Wales game, but I wouldn't rule Geoff and Brad out of the Italy game just yet.

‘We need all the players who are going to be considered for the Wales game to be training on Sunday and Monday. If that comes too soon we will rehab and get them back and they might take part in training towards the end of the week but the view then would be to try to get them to begin training the week of the Italy game.

‘I am very confident that Brad and Geoff are going to be fine sooner rather than later. I don't want to commit on Tom and Kyle because it is going to rest very much on what the specialists say. But Tom has made good progress and with Kyle we will have to wait and see.’
