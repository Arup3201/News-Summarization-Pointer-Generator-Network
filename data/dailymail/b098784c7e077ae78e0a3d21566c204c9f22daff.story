Many people will know the familiar nag of 'when are you going to find yourself a nice partner and settle down?' but most would simply shrug it off. One woman however grew so tired of being pestered about settling down that 14 years ago she decided to fabricate her own family.

Suzanne Heintz has been photographing her imaginary life with mannequin husband and mannequin child - from proposal, to wedding, to family holidays - ever since.

The American photographer, 42, presents her work in a funny, thought-provoking and undoubtedly challenging picture series called The Playing House Project: Life Once Removed.

Suzanne was tired of the pressure to conform to expectations for a 'woman her age to have a ring on her finger'. She was sick of people's unrealistic expectations from herself and from life in general - but in particular that of women and marriage.

'People said: "You're such a nice girl, why aren't you married?" she writes.

'No one actually used that out of date word, but, what they were driving at was that I was a "Spinster", and I got tired of hearing about it. Even my Mother must have thought she was setting me straight when she said: "Suzy, there's nobody perfect out there. You just need to PICK somebody, if you're going to settle down"

'I snapped back, 'Mom! It's not like I can go out and BUY a family! I can't just MAKE it happen!" But then, I found a way. I bought a beautiful family… of mannequins. I decided to start a photo project out of the Kodak Moments I'd capture with my new Store-Bought Family.'

Suzanne
 was raised in the Mormon Church in New York, which made a lasting 
impression. It provided her first experience in the idealisation of 
family, and the glorification of the role of women as mother and 
homemaker.

These
 influences have come together in shaping the focus of her subject 
matter. The external pressures of culture, and the internal pressures 
she placed on herself to fit into the expectations of that culture, 
built up over time, until she decided to do something about it.

The artist employs satire and 
importantly humour in her work, because she feels that it is crucial to 
the digestion of what might be perceived as a 'bitter pill of social 
criticism'.

'My own home was the backdrop for the first images,' she explains.

'Over
 the next decade, scenes of an idyllic home life eventually extended 
into a series of holiday greetings, as a satirical response to annual 
family photo cards. However, the project took a turn after taking them 
on a road trip. I saw the potential in shooting in public.

'Seeing
 me work with the mannequins is such a peculiar and funny thing to 
witness, that people are immediately disarmed. As soon as that happens, 
their mind is open and impressionable.

'Using
 humor, paired with shock, allows my message to penetrate, and the work 
can have greater impact. The aim is to get people to reconsider their 
stubborn allegiance to traditional life expectations.'

'The term perfect is no longer used to describe what we're all striving to be. Now it is called fulfilled,' she says.

'But
 for women, the path to fulfillment is not through one thing, it's 
through all things; education, career, home, family, accomplishment, 
enlightenment. If any one of those things is left out, it's often 
perceived that there's something wrong with your life.

'We
 are somehow never enough, just as we are. Even if we do have a finger 
in each of those pies, there is never enough time to do any of them to 
our satisfaction. We are constantly set up by our expectations to feel 
as though we are missing something. 

'I
 thought it was high time to call this nonsense out publicly, because 
this notion of insufficiency is not just about me, nor exclusively about
 women in regards to marriage. It's about anyone whose life doesn't look
 the way it "should".

'Rarely
 does anyone's life turn out the way it was expected, and if by some 
miracle it does, what they expected isn't what they thought it was.

'I'm
 simply trying to get people to open up their minds, and quit clinging 
to outdated assumptions of what a successful life looks like. I want 
people to lighten up on each other, and themselves, and embrace their 
lives for who it's made them, with or without the Mrs., PhD. or Esq. 
attached to your name.'
