A former female Minnesota police officer will receive more than $1million in multiple lawsuit settlements after learning that dozens of her former co-workers illegally accessed her driver’s licence record just to gawk at her picture.

The Minneapolis City Council has agreed last week to pay Anne Marie Rasmusson $392,000, on top of a $280,000 settlement she reached with several other cities whose officers violated the law by accessing her record for personal reasons.

Rasmusson will also be awarded $385,000 from the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, for a total of $1,057,000 that taxpayers will have to pay, Wired reported. That figure could be even higher if the retired officer wins her suit against the state.

Toned: Rasmusson began entering body building competitions after she was forced into medical retirement, losing more than 70 pounds

The case marks one of the largest 
data breaches committed by law enforcement officials in history, 
according to the Minneapolis independent paper City Pages.

An investigation into Minnesota’s 
Dakota County Sheriff’s office, as well as state troopers and 
Bloomington police show that more than 100 officers  - from chiefs on down - were using the 
database as their personal Facebook.

Rasmusson, who was known by colleagues
as Bubbles because of her cheerful personality, first became aware that
other officers were looking up her photo when a former police academy 
colleague mentioned to her in 2009 that she looked great and that he and
his partner had used their squad car computer to view her driver’s 
license image.

In August 2011, she contacted the 
state’s Department of Public Safety asking if it was possible to 
restrict access to her driver’s license file. Following an 
investigation, a DPS worker revealed that her record had been accessed 
by officers numerous times as far back as 2007.

Ms Rasmusson, a 37-year-old retired cop, stands at a petite five feet two and has her hair trimmed short. 

Officers are only supposed to look someone up for official reasons.

That said, the incredible misuse of the database is astounding – City Pages found that 104 officers in 18 different state agencies accessed her driver’s licence record 425 times.

There were 24 police officers in Minneapolis who accessed her record 133
times, and 42 officers in St. Paul who looked her up 175 times.

The 37-year-old woman told City Pages: ‘There is nothing that I would say about this driver’s licence photo or any of my previous ones that in any way would deserve the attention that they’ve gotten.’

Breech of trust: Rasmusson, right, said she felt her privacy was violated and got sick after she found out how many times her personal data was accessed

Ms Ramusson told the paper that she feels her privacy has been violated. When she found out to what degree, she actually became ill.

One officer, who requested that he not be named, said that every cop – regardless of rank – had looked at her file.

In the lawsuits Rasmusson filed, she alleged that the officers violated, among
other things, the federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act,  which prohibits states from disclosing
personal information that drivers submit to obtain a license.

The city of St. Paul denied Rasmusson’s invasion-of-privacy allegations and any liability for her
claims, but said it agreed to settle with her in order ‘to avoid the uncertainties
and costs associated with continued litigation of this matter.’

Under the settlement, Rasmusson’s name, picture, address and other personal
information will be removed from the city and police department’s internal
directory and website.

In the aftermath of the case, most of the officers who looked up Rasmusson’s
record got away with warning letters and additional training.

An officer who accessed the woman’s file record 13 times received the harshest
punishment in the form of a demotion and a five-day suspension.

In Minneapolis, however, none of the 24 officers who looked up Rasmusson’s
photo have been disciplined, while St. Paul absolved four of its officers.

When she was 24 and new to the St Paul police force, one of her co-workers suggested a bet – who could lose the most body fat in three months.

The once overweight officer dropped 15 pounds in three months, and continued her regimen of exercise and healthy eating until she dropped an additional 70lbs.

Questions: She became suspicious after several acquaintances called her up out of the blue and asked her out on dates

An injury in 2003 forced Ms Ramusson to go into early retirement, but the determined fitness guru continued working out, and began entering body building competitions while her husband – another Minnesota officer – went to work.

She became suspicious when a former academy friend said she looked great in her driver’s licence photo. Then unsolicited texts from other officers trickled in, requesting her company on boating excursions. 

Tired of the texts, she insisted on an audit, and the results were shocking.

Her personal data – including her address, phone number, and driver’s licence information – had been accessed repeatedly by officers since 2007.

If federal privacy laws swing in her favour, all 104 officers who viewed her profile could lose their jobs.
