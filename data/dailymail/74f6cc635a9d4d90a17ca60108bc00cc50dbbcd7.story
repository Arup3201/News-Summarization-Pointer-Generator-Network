Before his four-year-old daughter Leah received cancer treatment, Devon Still gave her a moving pep talk.

The Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle posted the 10-second clip on Instagram alongside the caption: ‘I might be nervous and scared beyond words but I’ll never let her see it...let’s get this done!’

After four rounds of chemotherapy, Still posted a picture of Leah following the successful removal of a tumour.

‘After a 5hr 50min surgery the surgeon was able to remove ALL of her tumor and all of her lymph nodes and her right adrenal gland where it all started from...best news I’ve received in a long time #PrayForLeah #GodIsGood #ThanksForYourSupport,’ he said.

After being diagnosed in June with neuroblastoma, a form of childhood cancer, the public support for Leah has been incredible.

His jersey became the fastest-selling in history, with all proceeds going toward paediatric cancer research.

Still was cut by the Bengals but put on the practice squad to support Leah in June.

The move means that he will receive a weekly salary of $6,300, will have to travel less, and get to spend more time with Leah, who is being treated in Philadelphia.

Still explained: ‘They said if I keep working on my physical... and mentally prepared myself to focus on football then they can move me back up to the roster so I am not all the way out of the loop…’

‘Just them sticking by me through this whole time, they understand exactly what I am going through. It is a blessing I am on this organization.’

Since Leah’s diagnosis, Still has shared images on Instagram showing her dancing in the hospital and grinning as she headed back for her fourth round of chemotherapy.

The proud father, who is engaged, has also shaved his head in support of his daughter, who has lost her hair to her treatment.
