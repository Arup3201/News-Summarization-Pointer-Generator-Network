A heroic Washington Navy Yard employee has recounted the moment he raced to the aid of a blind co-worker as bullets rang out around them before leading him to safety.

Omar Grant was photographed holding the arm of his colleague, identified only as Linwood, and leading him away from the building after Aaron Alexis opened fire on Monday morning, killing 12.

The touching image, captured by a Yahoo! News reporter at the scene, has already become a symbol of the astonishing acts of kindness and bravery amid such terror.

Grant, an IT technician, recalled how he had just arrived at work and was standing in the atrium when he heard bullets echoing through the Navy Yard complex. He froze as people began running.

Support: He continued to tell Linwood where they were going and that he would not leave him alone

'As soon as we got outside the cafeteria 
doors into the hallway, we saw people panicked, running for the exits,'
Grant told the Today show. 'They were shouting. I couldn't make out exactly what they were
shouting, but I knew it was something serious.'

But his first thought was not for himself; he was near a visually-impaired colleague with a walking stick who was struggling to get away from the scene.

'He moves sometimes rather slowly so people are usually helping him and escorting him,' Grant told CBS. 'This time, he was all by himself. I did not want to leave him behind.'

Grant approached Linwood and held on to his arm.

'I said, "This is what we are going to do," and I'm describing where we were going,' Grant said. 'I told myself, "I'm not going to leave you, we're going to get out of here".'

Heroic: Omar Grant, pictured, said he told Linwood he would not leave him and led him to the train station

Together: Linwood, center, was interviewed at the scene and said all he was thinking was 'home'

Together they walked from the building as other workers scrambled for safety and police swarmed the scene, eventually shooting the gunman dead.

As the men left the scene, a reporter approached them and asked what was going through Linwood's mind when he heard the shots.

'Home,' he said, smiling. 'That's all I needed.'

Grant helped him walk from the base to the nearby Metro station and escorted him to the train.

Speaking to CBS, Grant said he was shaken by the day's tragic events.

Fears: Workers hold their hands to their heads as they are escorted out of the building where the gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday morning, killing 12 people

Chaos: More than 3,000 people work at the site in Washington D.C. where gunfire erupted on Monday

Relief: Edith Hutchins kisses her husband Shawn Hutchins as she picks him up after he was evacuated

'I'm here tonight with my family, and
I'm thinking of those people that aren't with theirs,' he said. 'Could I
have done something that could have helped them - some of them make it 
home.'

But he added that if he sees Linwood 
again, he wants to tell him that he can always be sure that Grant will 
be there to help him.

Twelve people were shot dead during Alexis' shooting spree on Monday morning. The 34-year-old civilian contractor was shot dead by police inside the building.

Alexis had been working as a civilian contractor for Hewlett-Packard as it performed an upgrade on the equipment at the site, the company confirmed to NBC on Monday.

Traumatized from pulling bodies from the mangled wreckage on 9/11, Alexis didn't sleep for days afterwards and later developed Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome - possibly as a result of what he saw at ground zero

Heartbreak: A candle-lit vigil is held on Freedom Plaza to remember the shooting victims on Monday night

He had previously served in the Navy 
Reserve but had a history of gun charges, and investigators said that he
may have recently lost his job with Hewlett-Packard.

Alexis
had been suffering from paranoia, sleep disorder and hearing voices in 
his head, U.S. law enforcement officials told the Associated Press, and 
heÂ  had been receiving treatment.

His
father told police that Alexis had 'anger management problems' which 
developed after he was involved in rescue attempts of September 11th, 
2001, according to the arrest report.
