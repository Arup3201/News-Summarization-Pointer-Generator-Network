A Connecticut man who says he lost an eye after being shot
in the face by murder suspect Aaron Hernandez in February has been ordered to
testify before a grand jury in Massachusetts that is investigating the former
New England Patriots star.

Hernandez has been charged with first-degree murder in
connection to the execution-style death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, who was
found gunned down June 17 in an industrial park not far from the football
player's home.

Superior Court Judge Joan Alexander in Hartford on Friday
ordered Alexander Bradley, 31, to appear July 17 in Fall River.

Eyewitness: A judge ordered Alexander Bradley, 31, to testify in connection to Aaron Hernandez's murder case after the Connecticut man had filed a lawsuit against the football player accusing him of shooting him in the face

Former friends: Bradley (left) claimed in his federal suit that Hernandez (right) discharged his unlicensed gun at him after an argument in a strip club in February, causing him to lose his right eye 

Bradley had been fighting an interstate subpoena, asserting
he needed to return to Florida for medical treatment, which involves cleaning
his prosthetic eye and making adjustments to it so it could track his vision, The Hartford Courant reported.

In a lawsuit filed four days before the discovery of Lloyd’s
body, Bradley claimed that he was shot by Hernandez with a handgun as they were
driving in Florida after getting into a heated argument in a Miami nightclub.
At the time, he told police he did not know who had shot him.

According to Florida police, a bullet struck Bradley in the
face February 13 while he was riding in a car with Hernandez and two other men
from Tootsie's strip club in Miami, where the two friends got into a
dispute. 

Bradley's civil suit seeking at least $75,000 in damages states
that Hernandez's gun, which the football player allegedly had no license to
carry, discharged. The bullet went through Bradley’s arm and struck the 31-year-old
man in the face, causing him to lose his right eye.

Legal woes: Hernandez (center) has been charged with murdering a friend execution-style last month

Timeline: The body of Boston Bandits football player Odin Lloyd, 27, was found June 17 near Hernandez's home just four days after Bradley had filed a lawsuit against his former friend

'It has been enucleated - replaced with a prosthetic eye,'
his attorney David Jaroslawicz told ABC News. 'He has also lost use of his
right arm.' 

The injuries, which have been described in the lawsuit as 'permanent
in nature,' resulted in several operations, leaving Bradley struggling to
ingest food and in pain.

On the morning following the shooting, Bradley was
discovered bleeding from his head and arm in an alley near a John Deere landscaping
business in Riviera Beach, Florida, according to NBC News.

When first responders and police officers arrived on the
scene, the victim reportedly refused to name the person who shot him while
denying that his wounds were self-inflicted.

Jaroslawicz believes that his client had been dumped alone
in an industrial park because Hernandez and the other two men who were with them
thought 'he would be dead.'

While being treated in a West Palm Beach hospital, Bradley
told police he only knew he was shot by 'black and Hispanic' men. The
31-year-old then stopped cooperating with investigators, causing the case to
become inactive.

Only four months after the shooting, Bradley named Hernandez as the alleged gunman in his federal lawsuit.

High stakes: The grand jury that will hear Bradley's testimony will be tasked with determining whether Hernandez is to be formally indicted

The lawyer said last month that his client would like to find
out if Hernandez had fired the gun at Bradley on purpose. According to
Jaroslawicz, Bradley and Hernandez had known each other for several years, and
his client thought the former Patriots star was his friend, USA Today reported.

Hernandez is being held without bail in the Bristol County
Jail after entering a not guilty plea. The grand jury will determine if he will
be formally indicted on the murder charge. 

Mr Bradely is expected to offer his testimony before the
grand jury panel at 9am on July 17. 

Two weeks before Bradley was shot in Florida, Massachusetts
State Police arrested him for drunken driving and speeding on Interstate 93,
while Hernandez was apparently a passenger in the car, according to court
records, according to Boston.com.

Troubled: Bradley served time in prison on a drug conviction, was arrested for drunken driving in February and is now accused of punching his ex-girlfriend in the face

On Tuesday, the 31-year-old appeared in Hartford Superior
Court in Connecticut on unrelated charges that he punched his ex-girlfriend in
the face. A judge ordered Bradley to stay away from the battered woman.  

CBS News said that in 2006, Bradley reportedly served a year-and-a-half in
prison after being convicted on drug charges.
