A Kansas man had to have all ten of his toes amputated after he walked for an hour in the snow wearing dress shoes - and he will now have to learn to walk again.

Evan Harter, 22, from Plattsburg, battled home through Arctic conditions last December after his car broke down wearing clothing best suited for a dinner party – and paid the price.

He went to bed while wearing his wet socks and woke up to purple ankles and feet.

Lesson learnt: Evan Harter had to have all his toes amputated after walking home in the snow in dress shoes

He told KCTV: ‘It took me about an hour to walk home. I was wearing dress slippers, a nice shirt, a jacket, long underwear, no gloves and actually no hat.

‘My feet were purple from the ankle all the way to the toes.’

Harter’s fingernails had also turned black.

He told KMBC that he'd walked home from the centre of Plattsburg after attending a party - a distance of about two miles.

Dr Richard Korentager, of the University of Kansas Hospital, said: 'It's a lifetime of challenges. He should be very functional, and that's our goal. There are things he is going to have to deal with, but it is going to be a long road for him.'

Needless to say, Harter can clearly see now that he should have wrapped up properly.

Pain: Harter's fingers were also badly affected by the frostbite

He added: ‘Always keep extra clothes in your car definitely no matter what.’

Frostbite strikes during temperatures below minus 0.55ºC (31ºF) and can affect any part of the body, though it's normally the extremities such as hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, that suffer, according to the UK's NHS website.

The first symptoms are tissue and skin feeling cold and painful, followed by pins and needles and then numbness.
