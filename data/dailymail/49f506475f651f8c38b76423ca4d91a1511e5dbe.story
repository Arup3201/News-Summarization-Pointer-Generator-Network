Got her work cut out: Snowy the Great Dane from York Haven, Pennsylvania, gave birth to a near-record litter of 19 three weeks ago and has been non-stop ever since

The couple told WHTM news that they knew Snowy was pregnant and were expecting a litter of eight - the average size for a Great Dane.

But when they went to a veterinary appointment, an X-ray revealed 15 tiny spines.

Unexpected delivery: Snowy's owners, Brandon and Aimie Terry,  described her pregnancy as a 'shock' 

Not what we bargained for: The couple expected a litter of eight - the average size for a Great Dane

Affectionate: Brandon Terry gives one of the puppies a nose rub

The other four puppies went unseen on the scan.

Shortly after, Mr Terry was out in the yard when he kept hearing a noise  similar to a kitten's mewing.

When he looked, he found Snowy with her first puppy. The expectant mother was taken inside  where she gave birth to six more.

The rest of her brood were born at an animal hospital. The delivery came one week earlier than expected.

'We were not prepared,' Mrs Terry said laughing. 

In good hands: Some of the puppies were born at home, while the rest were delivered at an animal hospital 

Growing quickly: The dogs recently opened their eyes for the first time  

Boisterous: 'Right now they’re into exploring and playing, fighting with each other,' Mrs Terry said

Her daughter has also been helping look after the puppies. They are now crawling about and recently opened their eyes.

'Right now they’re into exploring and playing, fighting with each other,' Mrs Terry added. 

The family is hoping to find new homes for the dogs before they grow too big. Their eventual height will be around three feet.

They are currently listed for $850 each on puppyfind.com, ready for pick-up one week before Christmas.

According to the website kennel.com, the largest known litter of puppies for a Great Dane is 23.
