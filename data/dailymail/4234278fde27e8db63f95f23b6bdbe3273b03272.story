Chinese workers at factories making Dell computers are being forced to work seven day, 74 hour weeks under appalling conditions for as little as 66p an hour, it has been claimed.

An undercover investigation by Danish and Chinese Labour watchdogs secretly filmed conditions inside four Chinese factories.

They found shocking evidence that workers were being forced to live in cramped, squalid dormitories where there was said to be not enough hot water to wash.

Probe: An undercover investigation at four Chinese factories making Dell computers found workers were being forced to work seven-day, 74 hour weeks often under poor conditions

Investigations were carried out at the MSI factory in Shenzhen city, the Mingshou factory in Suzhou city and the Hipro Electronics and Taida Electronics factories both in Dongguan city, Guangdong province.

At the Mingshuo factory there was found to be just one toilet for every 55 workers, one shower room for every 90 workers and 272 workers were having to share one coin operated washing machine.

The workers are reportedly forced to work overtime for up to four hours per day and are fined for their mistakes.

Tech giant: Dell is the world's third largest PC manufacturer

In factories in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, workers were also found to breathe chemical fumes all day long as they assembled components.

Workers welding circuit boards also complained about skin rashes from direct and indirect contact with the electronics.

Dell is the world's third largest PC manufacturer and the company currently has 21 multi-million pound contracts with the UK public sector, including with universities.     

A spokesman for DanWatch, a Denmark-based independent watchdog, which carried out the investigation with China Labour Watch, said the workers' pay fell bellow the Chinese minimum wage.

One worker, 18-year-old Zhao Lily, 18, told the investigators how she and her colleagues work, eat and live in the same dormitory at the factory grounds of the MSI factory.

Describing the condition son the factory floor, she said: 'Because of the welding, the temperature is uncomfortably high and the smell is toxic. We don’t get mouth protection and I get skin irritation if I touch my face at work.'

Zhao also explained how she finds the work exhausting because of the repetitive movements and long hours.

'We have to stand up the entire 12 hour shift; to sit down, you have to ask for permission.', she added.

Eva
Hesse Lundström, editor of DanWatch, said: 'When companies compete on 
supplying computers in the cheapest way possible, and when our public 
buyers aim for the cheapest wares on the market, a high human cost is 
paid.

'Our research shows that the conditions at Dell’s suppliers violate ILO conventions and Chinese labor law as well as Dells own policy.'

A spokesman for Dell said the company conducts was already conducting audits of three of the factories involved and would take appropriate action regarding any reports of poor working conditions in our supply chain.

A statement from the firm read: 'Dell employs high standards for workplace conditions and safety in our facilities and we expect our supplier partners to employ the same high standards.

'It is also our policy to thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action regarding any reports of poor working conditions in our supply chain.'
