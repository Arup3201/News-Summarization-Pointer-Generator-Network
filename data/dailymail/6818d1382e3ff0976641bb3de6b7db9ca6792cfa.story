A chip shop boss has insisted he’s not racist after putting up a banner boasting that the business now had 'English owners'.

Paul Bradbury insists customers 'want to know they are going to be served by somebody English' - even though the shop had previously been run by English people of east Asian descent and of Greek descent.

He and his wife Rachel took over the Chippy On The Green, in Hapton Road, Padiham, Lancashire less than a fortnight ago.

Furore: Paul Bradbury outside his fish and chip shop, where he has put up a banner boasting that the business now had 'English owners', sparking anger

But the couple have already provoked a furious row with a banner across the front of the shop that reads: ‘Under new management with English owners’.

Burnley’s Lib Dem MP Gordon Birtwistle and the mayor of Padiham have both issued demands for it to be removed.

But defiant Mr Bradbury has no plans to take it down.

He said: 'I’m not racist. Anyone who thinks I’m a bigot is narrow-minded.

'People want to know they are going to be served by somebody English. People have said to us that they are glad somebody English is serving them and that the sign made them want to come in.

'They’ve never had anyone in the shop before. We are advertising that we are English.

'You wouldn’t want your fish and chips served to you by someone Turkish, or from wherever, because it wouldn’t be as good a recipe as it would be from somebody English.

'It doesn’t matter what colour or race you are, we’ll serve you. We welcome everyone here. I won’t be taking the sign down.

'We don’t want to upset anyone and we aren’t racist. We wouldn’t be serving foreign food if we were racist.'

The shop, which sells traditional English takeaways alongside Chinese food, kebabs and pizza, re-opened on Tuesday.

Gordon Birtwistle MP said: 'I would rather it didn’t say what it did. It would be better if it said "serving good quality food to the community". If it is causing consternation to people, it should either be taken down or changed.'

Mayor of Padiham, Coun Vincent Pridden said: 'I don’t think it’s a very positive message to be putting out in the community. If it’s causing upset, the council should look into it.'

Gary Curson, a teacher at West Craven
 High School in Barnoldswick who lives near the shop, said he would not 
set foot in the takeaway again.

He said racism was ‘alive and well in Padiham’.

He
 said: 'We’ve used that chip shop when it was run by other people, who 
were well liked and respected in the community. I wouldn’t go in there 
now and neither would many of the people I know.

'Half a dozen local people I’ve spoken to since yesterday have said they are disgusted by what it says.

'In this day and age, it shouldn’t matter who you are being served by.

'It’s
 not a positive message to put out to children which go to local schools
 that you should prefer to go into a shop run by one sort of people. 
It’s not good for them or for the community.

'Burnley
 is supposed to be an enterprising, multi-cultural place. Asian people 
run the shop just down the road. This gives a very bad impression of the
 area and could well upset people.'

Local councillor Joanne Greenwood said: 'It’s not helpful at all and it could well upset people and I can see why. I certainly don’t think it’s necessary to say that.'

Lancashire Police say they have not yet received any complaints about the banner.

Earlier this year ex-soldier Steven 
Rolfe was ordered to remove the painted English flag from the front door
 of his home in Preston.

The
 52-year-old former soldier painted the red and white symbol on his 
front door in 2003 yet only his landlords decided it is ‘offensive’ and 
must go.

He said: 'I’m ex-forces and I’m proud to be English. I’m not in the EDL or any other racist group. I’m very angry about this.'

Muslim
 groups criticised the housing company’s stance. Ali Anwar, a Muslim 
representative on the Preston faith forum, said: ‘This is political 
correctness gone mad.

'As a Muslim it really frustrates me that 
organisations become overly politically correct and make issues and 
tensions where there aren’t any.

'They don’t speak for the Muslim community.

‘The
 flag of St George needs to be reclaimed from the far right. There is 
nothing offensive about the flag and anyone who is proud to be English 
should be able to fly it.’
