An investigation has been launched after an Army platoon was accused of racially abusing its own soldiers in an event known as 'Racial Thursdays'.

The sickening tradition allegedly has been taking place among soldiers in the 2nd Platoon, C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska.

The Army Times first reported on the racist behavior after several soldiers, who wished to remain anonymous, came forward.

One staff sergeant, who is black, told the newspaper this week: 'When I first got to my unit, someone said we should do ''Racial Thursdays'' because it's been a tradition.

'It's something they made up where you can say any racist remark you want without any consequences. The platoon sergeant said no, but the s*** is still going on.'

A platoon based at Fort Wainwright in Alaska (pictured) has been placed under investigation after it emerged that they were holding 'Racial Thursdays' - when any racist remark was allowed without consequence. 

Another soldier of lower rank verified the story but also asked to remain anonymous. 

He said that a Latino colleague was badgered with racial slurs for hours until he almost got into a fight with another soldier. 

'Racial Thursdays' were reportedly taking place at the same unit in Alaska where Pvt Danny Chen (pictured) once belonged. The solider, 19, committed suicide in 2011 after what investigators said was weeks of abuse and racial slurs

The platoon leader allegedly encouraged the practice 'to build morale and camaraderie', The Army Times reported.  

'Racial Thursdays' have allegedly been taking place at the same unit where Private Danny Chen once belonged, The Army Times reported. 

The 19-year-old infantryman from New York City shot himself in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan in October 2011 after what investigators described as weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs.

The young soldier endured attacks on a daily basis for six weeks from fellow soliders who singled him out for being Chinese-American. 

He was taunted with the slurs 'gook', 'chink' and 'dragon lady', according to reports, beaten and put on excessive guard duty to the point of exhaustion.

The day of his death he was made to crawl 100 yards over gravel carrying equipment while rocks were thrown at him by fellow soldiers. 

In December  2011, the Army charged eight soldiers with various crimes relating to Chen's death. Four soldiers were ultimately court-martialed. 

In a statement to Daily Mail Online, the U.S. Army in Alaska said: 'We are already aware of these allegations, as an informal complaint was made through command channels about this alleged behavior. The command has assigned an investigating officer and the investigation is ongoing. The command is extremely sensitive to any complaints that involve equal opportunity or discrimination and will investigate every allegation.

'It's important to emphasize that these allegations are just that. They're allegations, and that's what the investigation has been assigned to find out, exactly what happened and if anything happened.

'Based on the results of that inquiry, and if the evidence supports it, the commander, usually the brigade commander, can elect to conduct a 15-6 investigation. 

'Treating all soldiers with dignity and respect is something this command takes extremely seriously, and when there are any indications that those values are not being followed, the command will absolutely make inquiries, conduct appropriate investigations and take action as necessary.'
