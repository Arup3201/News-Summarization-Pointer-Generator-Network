Ed Miliband’s relationship with business hit a new low last night after he snubbed a major gathering of company executives.

The Labour leader, who is struggling to persuade business leaders that he is on their side, stunned organisers of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) annual conference by telling them he was too busy to attend.

BCC director general John Longworth described Mr Miliband’s absence as ‘disappointing’, while critics said it showed he had ‘nothing to say’ to business.

John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce described Ed Miliband's absence due to 'other committments' as 'disappointing' after he was represented by Ed Balls and Chuka Umunna

The conference, one of the biggest annual gatherings of business representatives, was addressed by both David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Labour sent Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and business spokesman Chuka Umunna. However Mr Miliband spent the day locked in ‘internal meetings’ in Westminster – just 200 yards from the conference venue.

Mr Longworth said: ‘It is disappointing that Ed Miliband is not at our conference. It was an opportunity to speak in a friendly business environment and to present his views.’ He explained that the conference organisers had been told the Labour leader had ‘other commitments’.

Labour initially declined to comment on Mr Miliband’s whereabouts. But a source later confirmed Mr Miliband had been holding meetings with advisers in Westminster. The source insisted Mr Miliband had not met with Unite union boss Len McCluskey, who was seen at the Commons yesterday.

A spokesman for Mr Miliband said it was ‘ridiculous’ to accuse him of snubbing business leaders. ‘Ed Miliband has given ten speeches to major business conferences since becoming Labour Leader including twice at the BCC,’ the spokesman said.

Ed Balls accused critics of ‘scraping the barrel of trivia’. But business minister Matt Hancock said: ‘Ed Miliband had literally nothing to say to the nation’s employers. He knows British businesses don’t back him and he was too weak even to talk to them. He has no economic plan to secure a better future for Britain and would only take us back.’

And a Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It’s astounding Ed Miliband has snubbed British business, especially in the week Labour has been accused of being anti-commerce.

‘It just goes to show Labour do not understand the importance of business in creating jobs and maintaining our hard-fought economic recovery. We know Ed Miliband can’t remember the deficit and it looks like he’s forgotten business too.’

Mr Miliband has come under fire from a string of senior business figures in recent weeks, including the head of Boots Stefano Pessina and the former Marks and Spencer boss Stuart Rose.

David Cameron said that while Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had backed the cross-party consensus that a healthy business environment was essential for growth, that consensus would be ‘over’ if Mr Miliband seizes power in May.

Mr Umunna dismissed the charge, insisting that Labour remains pro-business. And yesterday Labour attempted to get on the front foot by unveiling a new business donor. Dale Vince, founder of green energy firm Ecotricity, announced that he was giving the party £250,000.

However last night it emerged that Mr Vince is also a leading critic of Mr Miliband’s flagship plan to freeze energy prices until 2017.

He has previously said: ‘I’m not sure how it would work. And if the Government begins freezing energy prices, where does it stop? Will they freeze petrol or food prices too?’
