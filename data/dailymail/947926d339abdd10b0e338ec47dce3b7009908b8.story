Tragic: Lynsey Popp was left to die alone in the wreckage of her fiance's car who fled the scene and went home to bed

A drink-driver left his bride-to-be to die alone in the wreckage of a car crash and went home to bed.

Instead of calling for help, drunken fiance Ceiron Cook, 36, fled the scene leaving Lynsey Popp, 28, on her own. 

Passing motorists were horrified when they discovered Miss Popp's lifeless body in the passenger seat of the car which had crashed into a tree.

Police and paramedics were called but mother-of-two Miss Popp was already dead.

The court heard when Cook was woken hours later his 'slurred' words were: 'Where's Lynsey? Is she okay?'

Charity worker Cook had taken 'love of his life' Lynsey for a late-night drive on icy roads in January when the tragedy happened.

Prosecutor Rachel Knight said: 'Lynsey was in the front passenger seat of the Honda Civic car being driven by her partner and the man she intended to marry.

'The car smashed into a tree but instead of calling the emergency services Cook ran off leaving her dead or dying.

'It was not until some time later that the crashed car was discovered by two passers by who raised the alarm.

'They noticed the car was cold and that there was nobody in the driver's seat.

'But to their horror they saw there was a passenger. 

'She was removed from the car and taken to hospital but it was clear that she had died at the scene.'

The court heard Cook was an uninsured provisional licence holder with a record of driving while disqualified and uninsured.

Cook blamed snow and ice for causing the accident on a country road near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

Close: The family of Lynsey Popp say they may have forgiven Cook if he had stayed with his daughter

The court heard he had met 'happy and smiling' Lynsey 10-months earlier and the pair were making marriage plans.

Jailed: Ceiron Cook crashed his car after being over the alcohol limit. He left his fiancee to die in the wreckage and fled the scene

Lucy Crowther, defending, said: 'The harsh reality is that he does not care how long he receives in prison because as far as he is concerned he will never be able to forgive himself.

'This was somebody who he loved more than anyone else in the world and he has killed her.

'There were questions about why it was that he ran.

'When one knows the condition in which he was found the first thing that he said was where's Lynsey.

'Perhaps that goes to show the limited degree of functioning that he had at that time.

'It was not to try and not to help Lynsey because that's what he wanted above all. He was determined to make her a happy wife.'

Cook, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, was jailed for four years after admitting causing death by careless driving while over the alcohol limit.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard he had 124 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80.

He had also been smoking cannabis on the night of the crash on January 25.

Cook spent four days in hospital after suffering a broken shoulder, fractured ribs, fractured cheekbone and ruptured spleen.

Miss Popp suffered horrific injuries, including a fractured skull and laceration to the carotid artery.

Her devastated family told the court they could have forgiven Cook if he had stayed with her.

Helen Popp recalled the exact time she discovered her step-daughter was dead.

Heartbroken: Lynsey with her father Colin who said Cook should have stayed with his daughter

She said: 'It was 5.24am and it is the worse news of anyone's life to tell your husband that his daughter has been killed.'

Cook, who had just started a business exporting clothes to developing countries, was disqualified from driving for five years.

Judge Richard Twomlow: 'It would seem that Lynsey died instantly. 

'No words I can say or sentence I can pass can alleviate the loss and distress felt by her family.'

Miss Popp had a daughter Libby, nine, and son Thomas, six.

Her father Colin Popp, 49, said after the case: 'We accept that Ceiron Cook is remorseful.

'He will have to get up every day and know that he has killed someone. But four years for a life does not fit the crime.

'He still could have stayed with her. If you loved somebody you would stay.

'We could have forgiven him if he had not left her or called an ambulance.'
