A man has been arrested after he punched an elderly man in the face for asking him to stop swearing inside an Applebee's restaurant in Florida.

Mikie Dominic Sawyer, 26, was saying a string of expletives at the bar in the Dunlawton Avenue Applebee's in Port Orange when 80-year-old Harry Sander approached him and asked him to stop.

According to police, Sander politely asked Sawyer to stop using the 'F' word and to stop talking so  loudly about body parts.

But Sawyer told Sanders he didn't have to stop cursing if he didn't want to before punching Sanders in the face and pushing him to the ground, according to WKMG.

Police said an eyewitness backed up Sanders story and told police that he also heard Sawyer cursing loudly.

The witness said that after Sander asked Sawyer to stop, Sawyer told him, 'I don't care where you are from, whether it be Russian or Dutch, take your (expletive) to the other side of the bar,' before punching him.

Police said several other eyewitnesses described the incident similarly. 

However, one man said he thought Sanders may have also pushed Sawyer.

Sawyer left the restaurant before police arrived, but was later pulled over after police got a description of his vehicle.

Sawyer told police that Sander had been the one who actually punched him.

But a police report showed that while Sawyer had no bruising to his face, he did have discoloration and bruising to his knuckles and fingers.

Police arrested Sawyer and he was charged with battery on a person over 65 years of age and disorderly conduct.

Sawyer was taken to the Volusia County Branch Jail, where he is being held on a $2,500 bond.
