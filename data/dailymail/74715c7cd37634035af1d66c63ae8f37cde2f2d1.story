Can't face the rush-hour schlep into work the morning after the Christmas party? Who can blame you.

But now might be a good time to call upon the services of the most decadent hangover cure around.

A high-end noodle brand has launched a bespoke taxi service to relieve office workers' hangovers this party season.

Kabuto Noodles has created the Kab-U-To Work taxi service, a London-wide package that sees you being ferried to work in the comfort of a taxi, while being served a pot of hot Kabuto soup noodles and fresh orange juice.

Christmas party season taking its toll? Perhaps its time to book yourself a cab journey into work with a bowl of soup noodles to keep you warm

You'll also be given a pair of sunglasses, some paracetamol and a packet of breath mints. Just in case.

The taxi driver will also create a soothing atmosphere on the journey to work by playing relaxing music, a world away from the crowded commuter tube.

Kabuto is trialling the service this Christmas party season in London with the potential to expand to other cities. Bookings will be taken from the 11th December.

And the best bit? It's all free for now.

Crispin Busk, Founder of Kabuto Noodles, said: 'We have seen a huge response online from noodle fans eating Kabuto, stating it's their favourite hangover cure.

'We wanted to take this a little bit further and provide the ultimate hangover service. Kabuto Noodles is the perfect snack for those with a busy lifestyle and with the hectic Christmas season in full swing we know that people need a helping hand.

'The Kab-U-To Work service provides just that, with the ultimate relief from the post office party hangover.

'What could be more convenient when you're hungover than a door-to-door taxi service and a Kabuto Hangover Pack to get you back to your desk in a fit enough state to face your inbox and your colleagues (who may or may not have appreciated your rendition of Mariah Carey from the night beforeâ€¦)?'

Party-goers can pre-book their Kab-U-To 
Work journey using the email address kabutowork@kabutonoodles.com with 
the details of their booking, or by tweeting @kabutonoodles using

The service is completely free for those who book during the trial period in the lead up to Christmas.

A spokesman said: 'We have a limited
number of available bookings but we have been taking them for a week and
had some fantastic feedback. We've still got quite a bit of availability in
the lead up to Christmas Eve!

'Judging on the success we will just charge people for the
taxi fare in future but we will give them the hangover kits in the cost.'
