His brief is clear: to inject some impetus into Reading’s ailing season before it becomes too late, to find some stability, solidity and momentum to rescue a campaign in danger of being tossed away.

Yesterday, we started to see Steve Clarke’s blueprint emerge. This was not far off how the Royals boss would have pictured life when he took over from Nigel Adkins less than a fortnight ago.

His team were purposeful, direct and pretty good to watch, certainly far too strong for a Norwich side whose performance was described by their manager Neil Adams as ‘chalk and cheese’ from recent weeks.

There was an end to their Madejski goal drought, dating back to November 4, with strikes from Hal Robson-Kanu, a penalty, and Simon Cox. That monkey is off their backs.

And there was warm appreciation from the home crowd, who have noticed a swift improvement and seemingly taken Clarke (right) to their hearts. He already has a ‘Barmy Army’ in any case, singling lustily in the second half.

Frustrations from the 1-0 home loss to Watford in his maiden match before Christmas and Inigo Calderon’s last-minute equaliser for Brighton on Boxing Day were replaced with cheer as 2014 ticks over into 2015.

‘It’s nice for me, I can enjoy a glass of red tonight, which always tastes a little bit better when you win,’ said Clarke.

‘I’m delighted with the players. Their application in the short time I’ve been at the club has been great. And I’m delighted for the fans.’

‘Application’ was one of three qualities demanded by Clarke in his programme notes. The others were ‘attitude’ and ‘character’.

The first two were in evidence from the off, as Reading set about their business energetically and incisively, gaining a two-goal lead by half-time.

The ‘character’ part came towards the end, after Bradley Johnson’s thunderbolt in controversial circumstances gave Norwich, who had scored 13 in their three previous outings, hope of an unlikely revival.

Johnson’s goal prompted howls of derision from the crowd as Reading were down to 10 men after Garath McCleary required treatment and about to make a double substitution.

But just as the fourth official was about to illuminate his board, referee James Linington waved play on and Norwich scored.

‘The referee seemed to take the law into his own hands,’ said Clarke. ‘For some reason he wouldn’t let us make that change, it was extraordinary.’

Adams argued his players had technically done nothing wrong since the referee had allowed play to continue.

In the end, it didn’t matter. The late Norwich onslaught never materialised and Clarke claimed his first victory in charge at the third attempt.

They led on 25 minutes when Johnson got into a muddle and hauled down Michael Hector at a corner. Robson-Kanu sent John Ruddy the wrong way with his penalty.

Nine minutes later, the lively Glenn Murray was played clear down the right following a neat passing move and crossed for Cox to finish.

Clarke is keen on signing Crystal Palace striker Glenn Murray on a permanent deal

With time up on Murray’s temporary loan deal from Crystal Palace, this could be the last Reading see of him but Clarke is doing everything in his power to keep him.

‘It was hopefully not a farewell,’ he said. ‘He deserves the reception, he’s contributed with goals and good performances. There is a structure in place where we can do a deal.’

He added, as a caveat, that the dismissal of Neil Warnock as Palace boss had rather left negotiations ‘in limbo’.

The same could be said of Reading’s season at times. Having missed out on the play-offs by a point last time, 16th was not where their fans expected them to be.

But, with Clarke at the helm, the green shoots of recovery are starting to sprout.
