People who often text with their thumbs may experience an abnormal thickening of the tendons in their hand leading to tendinitis, according to a new study from the American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation.

The study also discovered that, even when using thumbs, the majority of people tended to put more stress on the thumb of their dominant hand.

Overuse injuries of such small tendons have received almost no study in the past, the paper noted.

As The Wall Street Journal reports, the researchers used 149 people in Turkey from ages 18 to 40 for their study.

Participants were ranked by their texting style and frequency.

Tendon thickness was recorded in ultrasound images showing the length through the carpal tunnel to the thumb's tip.

For those who texted frequently, the dominant side's tendon was much thicker.

Thickness increased for those who sent the most texts.

Those who texted the most reported having greater thumb pain in their dominant texting hand compared to people who rarely sent text messages.

Infrequent texters sent an average of just 50 messages in a month while frequent texters may write as many as 1,209.
