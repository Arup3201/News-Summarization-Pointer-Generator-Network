They have been protesting about 'corporate greed' outside St Paul's Cathedral for weeks with an apparent goal to destroy capitalism.

But it seems the Occupy London camp in the heart of the capital's financial district is having trouble controlling its own financial affairs.

This week some demonstrators were accused of becoming 'elitist' with too much power over the group amid accusations of the misuse of funds.

Allegations: Some demonstrators were accused of becoming 'elitist' with too much power over the group amid accusations of the misuse of funds

Claims: Some activists (none pictured) apparently regard themselves as 'more equal than others' and have been compared to the ruling elite satirised in George Orwell's famous Animal Farm

Some were said to regard themselves as 'more equal than others' and have been compared to the ruling elite satirised in George Orwell's famous Animal Farm.

The allegations emerged as the demonstrators met for a meeting in Starbucks on Tuesday but argued about their pot of money and how and when it should be spent, The Times said.

It led to rising tensions and members of the finance committee stepping down.

One member, 25-year-old Tess Jones from New York was accused of using donations from the public to pay for flights to New York.

She has vehemently denied the allegations as 'wild rumours' and has vowed to stay and help form an interim committee.

'Some are more equal than others': Animal Farm was a satirical account of the Russian Revolution and the Stalinist regime

An anonymous source told the newspaper two main leaders in their 40s and 50s and three people in their 20s were controlling the group and a charter had been drawn up giving power to very few people.

Animal Farm by George Orwell was published in England on 17 August 1945.

Orwell, a democratic socialist, retells the story of the emergence and development of Soviet communism up to and during the Stalin era before World War II.

In the book the animals overthrow their human oppressors and establish a socialist state called Animal Farm which eventually collapses.

The pigs, being the most intelligent animals in the group, take control of the planning and government of the farm and then declare themselves the decision-makers.

Over the years they become more and more like humans. Eventually, the seven principles of Animalism, known as the Seven Commandments and inscribed on the side of the barn, become reduced to a single principle reading 'all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.'

She said: 'We
 are calling it the Animal Farm manifesto. The are always smartly 
dressed. I don't know how they manage it when we are all camping and 
they go off and have their secret meetings in Starbucks.

In addition, she claimed: 'A small number 
have decided they are more equal and are controlling the rest of us.'

The source alleged the group had Â£21,000 in public donations two weeks ago but the leaders, who she said could sometimes be 'aggressive', had apparently said there was no more money for the food or 'tranquility' tent - in charge of welfare - and the legal team were banned from using taxis or buying stationery.

She demanded to know where the 'missing' money had gone and said people were starting to leave as there wasn't enough food.

In Orwell's 1945 novel, based on the Russian Revolution, the animals of Manor Farm overthrow the dictator farmer Mr Jones to establish a new regime based on communism.

But the system fails as some of the 
animals become ruthless dictators declaring that 'All animals are equal 
but some are more equal than others'.

The anti-capitalist protest at the 
Cathedral is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to 
highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy.

Power: An anonymous source said two main leaders and three people in their 20s were controlling the group and a charter had been drawn up giving power to very few people

Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul's since October 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed.

The Occupy London group say its aim is: 'A future free from austerity, growing 
inequality, unemployment, tax injustice and a political elite who 
ignores its citizens, and work towards concrete demands to be met.'

Last month they took over an empty office building owned by investment bank UBS.

It was the latest act of defiance from the group who said they would legally challenge 24-hour eviction legal notices pinned to their tents outside the Cathedral.

The camp's presence has led to a humiliating internal row within the church which led to two high
 profile resignations.
