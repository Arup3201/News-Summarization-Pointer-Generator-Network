A routine stowaway who was recently ordered to spend 117 days in jail for violating probation by returning to Los Angeles International Airport when she was ordered not to has been released due to overcrowding.

Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was spotted wandering LAX without a ticket on August 7 - just one day after a judge placed her on probation for two years for sneaking aboard the Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles.

On Wednesday a court commissioner ordered her to serve 117 days - scolding her for again wasting law enforcement resources - however she was released from Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, California, shortly after 6 p.m.

She was released because of jail overcrowding and a state program that credits nonviolent misdemeanor offenders such as Hartman for good behavior, time served and other circumstances, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Crystal Hernandez said.

Released: Marilyn Jean Hartman served just three days of a 117-day jail sentence - after violating her probation for repeatedly sneaking onto flights - due to overcrowding

Hartman, who has made previous attempts 
to sneak aboard flights at other airports, was arrested August 4 for 
taking a Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles without a
 ticket. 

Safe place: Marilyn Jean Hartman has a history of mental illness and has said that she feels safer in airports than on the streets

At Mineta San Jose International Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's documents, law enforcement officials said.

She later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft and was sentenced to two years of probation.

Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said.

Hartman later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket.

Outside
 the courthouse after sentencing, Hartman said she would never try to sneak 
onto a plane again.

'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to 
repeat,' she said.

However, 
Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling 
the woman 'with a fixation on flying would return to LAX, so police 
passed out fliers with her picture.

'She was seen wandering through several terminals today in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said.

Repeated attempts:  Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights earlier in the year. She spent three days in jail

In
 February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo 
County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound 
flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days.

Her
 breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and
 the airline to launch investigations.

It also prompted criticism of the
 airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in
 the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous 
journey to Maui.

Hartman, who authorities say has a 
history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for 
trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's 
been caught after successfully boarding a flight.

She
 said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate 
measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the 
streets.

San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married.

According
 to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in 
sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the 
last few years.

Records
 indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in
 Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle 
reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up 
for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant.

Plane fixation: Hartman tried at least three times to breach airport security before she was able to get through a checkpoint without a boarding pass at Mineta San Jose International Airport on Monday, August 4

According
 to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully 
hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later 
released without charge. 

In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month.

'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said.

'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.'

Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt.

On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix.

She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.
