Louis van Gaal's side will be desperate to avoid defeat against Liverpool as the Reds will leapfrog Manchester United if they can claim all three points. 

Herrera is expected to keep his spot in United's starting line-up, while Rojo could be named on the substitutes' bench following his return from a groin injury. 

Van Gaal said on Friday that both Rojo and Luke Shaw were not fit enough to start against Liverpool.
