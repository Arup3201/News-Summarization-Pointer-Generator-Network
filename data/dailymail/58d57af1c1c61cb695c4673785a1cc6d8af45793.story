The FBI claims a thorough search of their archives revealed no evidence of  tapes showing Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh had a accomplice

The FBI has dismissed claims they are withholding security camera footage that proves a second man was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing, insisting agents searched their archives thoroughly and found no evidence of any such material.

Salt Lake City lawyer Jesse Trentadue has launched a freedom of information lawsuit against the FBI and the CIA, demanding they release the alleged videos which supposedly show a man alongside Timothy McVeigh when he parked a truck outside the Oklahoma City federal building and detonated a bomb that killed 168 people.

But yesterday, 
on the first day of the trial, Linda Vernon, a longtime FBI 
employee who became the point person for the collection of evidence 
after the bombing, said she is 'completely confident' the agency has 
found every video of the bombing that exists.

FBI
 attorney Kathryn Wyer argued additional searches for videos would be 
burdensome and fruitless, and would take a single staff person more than
 18 months to conduct.

She said: 'The plaintiff has refused to accept that the 30 tapes he got are the only tapes'.

Mr Trentadue believes the presence of a 
second suspect in the truck explains why his brother, Kenneth Trentadue,
 was flown to Oklahoma several months after the bombing, where he died 
in a federal holding cell in what was labeled a suicide.

His
 belief that the tapes exists stems from a Secret Service document 
written shortly after the bombing that describes security video footage 
of the attack that shows suspects - in plural - exiting the truck three 
minutes before it went off.

Kenneth
 Trentadue bore a striking resemblance to the police sketch that 
officials sent out after the bombing based on witness descriptions of 
the enigmatic suspect 'John Doe No. 2,' who was the same height, build 
and complexion. The suspect was never identified.

On a mission: Jesse Trentadue is on a quest to explain his brother's mysterious jail cell death that has rekindled long-dormant questions about whether others were involved in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing

Looking for answers: Kenneth Trentadue was found bruised and stabbed by his family after the FBI said he hanged himself

The 30 video recordings the FBI has released don't show the explosion or McVeigh's arrival in a rental truck.

The
 FBI already has provided videos and paper documents that correspond 
with Trentadue's Freedom of Information Act request, Ms Wyer said.

The
 trial continues Today and will run at least through Wednesday before 
the judge makes a ruling. He could wait until a later date to decide.

If
 Mr Trentadue wins, he hopes to be able to search for the tapes himself 
rather than having to accept the FBI's answer that they don't exist.

Mr
 Trentadue is acting as his own attorney and tried to show that the FBI 
has not adequately followed up on information that could lead to the 
discovery of other videos.

He
 asked Monica Mitchell of the FBI about why the agency had not done more
 to search for a tape mentioned in a Secret Service log. It describes 
security video footage of suspects — in plural — exiting the truck three
 minutes before the bomb went off.

'Didn't it come to your mind that that tape may exist?' Mr Trentadue asked.

Ms
 Mitchell said she didn't know the authenticity of the Secret Service 
document and that Vernon told her she didn't know of the existence of 
such a tape.

Mr Trentadue 
asked if Ms Mitchell had asked FBI headquarters about the tape, citing 
documents that show it had one tape and 300 pages of documents. She 
acknowledged she had not asked headquarters about those items as part of
 the FOIA request.

The wreckage of the Alfred P Murrah building burned itself into the national psyche in 19956 but did McVeigh have company when he planted the bomb that did it?

Was another man involved? Terry Nichols (left) was sentenced to life in prison for helping McVeigh plot his terrorist act. Michael Fortier, the star witness in the Oklahoma City bombing trials, was released from federal prison in 2006 after serving a sentence for failing to inform authorities of what he knew about the bombing plot

A Secret
 Service agent testified in 2004 that the log does exist, but its 
information was pulled from reports that were never verified, said Stacy
 A. Bauerschmidt, who was then the assistant to the special agent in 
charge of the FBI's intelligence division.

Several
 investigators and prosecutors who worked the case told The Associated 
Press in 2004 they had never seen video like that described in the 
Secret Service log.

Mitchell
 and Vernon described how employees searched automated systems and by 
hand. Vernon said she spent 85 hours searching three computer databases 
created to track all the evidence.

The
 judge at one point asked Mitchell why the FBI never responded to a 
letter from Trentadue asking about a video that seemed to be incomplete.

'You basically did nothing?' Waddoups asked.

'We did nothing because we were confident in our search and what we located,' Mitchell said.

Later,
 he questioned why Vernon neglected to send several documents to 
Trentadue that mentioned videos, despite her previous claim that she 
erred on the side of inclusivity if she wasn't sure whether something 
fell under his request.

Trentadue's
 44-year-old brother, who was a convicted bank robber and construction 
worker, was brought to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons' Federal Transfer 
Center in Oklahoma City after being picked up for probation violations 
while coming back to the U.S. at the Mexican border, Jesse Trentadue 
said.

Taking the feds to court: Now Trentadue is on a mission to reveal the truth about his brother's death and his suing the FBI to get answers

Unsatisfied
 by the FBI's previous explanations, U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups 
has ordered the agency to explain why it can't find videos from the 
bombing that are mentioned in evidence logs, citing the public 
importance of the tapes.

'I
 did not start out to solve the Oklahoma City bombing, I started out for
 justice for my brother's murder,' Jesse Trentadue said. 'But along the 
way, every path I took, every lead I got, took me to the bombing.'

The
 FBI says it can't find anything to suggest the videos exist, and says 
it would be 'unreasonably burdensome' to do a search that would take a 
single staff person more than 18 months to conduct.

Kathy
 Sanders and Jannie Coverdale, who both lost grandchildren in the 
bombing, are grateful for Trentadue's pursuit of the case. Sanders said 
she's been waiting 19 years to see the tapes.
