Police are investigating more than 50 allegations of physical or sexual abuse at a former children's home.

Nottinghamshire Police said they are investigating claims that people were abused at the council-run Beechwood Children's Home in Mapperley, Nottinghamshire.

Some of the allegations date back nearly 30 years.

Claims: Beechwood Children's Home, in the town Mapperley, Nottinghamshire, (town centre pictured) closed in 2006

It is not the first time the establishment, which closed in 2006, has hit the headlines. In 2011 six alleged victims came forward saying they had suffered abuse at Beechwood.

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said allegations relating to three other homes in the county were also being investigated.

They are Bracken House in Bulwell, Ranskill Gardens in Bestwood, and Wood Nook in Beechdale.

Officers are also looking at claims relating to Risley Hall in Derbyshire.

Detective Inspector Yvonne Dales said: 'This is a thorough but complicated and sensitive investigation and the allegations are historic which in some cases relate to events which are said to have taken place nearly 30 years ago.

'We have experienced officers on the investigation team who are working hard on this case which presents many challenges, such as the difficulties around obtaining forensic and corroborative evidence, along with the fact that some of the alleged perpetrators have since died.'
