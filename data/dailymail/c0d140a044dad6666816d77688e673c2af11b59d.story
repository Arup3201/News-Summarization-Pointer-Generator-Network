Devoted: Father-of-three Paul Clark died hours before he was due to watch his daughter get married

A father who died in a crash was due to give away his only daughter at her wedding the next day, his family said today.

Paul Clark's wife Tracie said 'life will never be the same again' following the crash on the M20 near Sevenoaks, Kent.

Mr Clark, 51, from Sidcup, Kent, died on Boxing Day when his silver Vauxhall Vectra crashed between junctions 2 and 1 on the London-bound carriageway.

Mrs Clark said he was a 'devoted husband and father to three children'.

His daughter Danielle, 26, was due to get married at Chilston Park Hotel in Lenham, Maidstone, on December 27.

It is believed the wedding did not go ahead.

Mrs Clark said: 'Everyone who ever met Paul was touched by his infectious sense of humour and his immense love for all his family and special friends.'

He is survived by daughter Danielle and two sons Luke, 24, and Jack, 21.

Police initially appealed for a key witness who made the 999 call to come forward after the crash because his phone number was written incorrectly at the scene.

After hearing this appeal on the radio, the man made contact with police.

Officers are still appealing for other witnesses to come forward.

The incident was one of a number of fatal crashes over the Christmas period.

On Christmas Day Adnan Habib, aged 10, his four-year-old brother Mohammed Arsalaan and their aunt 32-year-old Bushra Tazarib were killed on the M6 in Staffordshire as they travelled to a wedding.

On December 27, seven-year-old 
Jessica Portor and her sister Tamzin, ten, were killed in a crash on the A47 near Kingâ€™s Lynn, Norfolk.

Ann Goodrich, 57, and her husband 
Paul, 56, were also killed on Christmas Day when the Volkswagen Golf they were travelling in crashed off a road near Basingstoke.
