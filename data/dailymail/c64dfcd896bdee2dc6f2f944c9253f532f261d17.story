Suicidal gunman: Alistair Bell, who was shot dead by police officer after an armed siege, rang his father and asked how best to kill himself, an inquest heard

A gunman in a police siege rang his father to ask about the best way of committing suicide, an inquest heard.

Alistair Bell, 42, was still shooting at police officers surrounding his home in Kirkheaton, West Yorkshire, when he called his father, Gordon, and said he wanted to kill himself.

Mr Bell senior told his son, who was later shot dead by a police marksman, where to aim the gun and advised him: 'Don't miss', an inquest heard.

He told the inquest into his son's death that Bell told him 'I've shot two coppers', and said it was pointless trying to talk him out of it as he knew he was determined not to go back to hospital.

Bell fired 34 shots, wounding one officer, during a lengthy stand-off that began when one officer went to arrest him after he allegedly threatened a former friend.

The jury at Bradford Crown Court heard that at one point during the six-hour stand-off, Bell called his father saying he wanted to kill himself and asked: 'What's the best way of doing it?'

His father said: 'Do it from the side of the head.  Don't miss.  It will be just like someone giving you a crack over the head,' the Huddersfield Examiner reported.

Mr Bell said he knew his son, whom he described as being his best friend, didn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.

The siege, on 27 December 2010, began when Bell pointed a gun at an officer who went to arrest him.  Bell then shot another officer, who was wearing body armour, in the back, injuring his shoulder.

Armed officers were sent to the house and the stand-off continued into the night, during which Bell shot out of the window of his home and sent text messages to family and friends, as well as to a police negotiator.

Bell, who was known to have a history of violence, told the police he had booby-trapped the house and threatened to blow them all up.

Scene: Bell  is said to have used this window to fire several bullets at police during the six-hour stand-off

Siege: Police surround the West Yorkshire house of Bell shortly after the gunman was shot dead

The inquest heard Mr Bell eventually came downstairs at around 5am and was shot by an officer who fired three rounds from a carbine.

One hit him in the crown of the head, which penetrated his brain, and another struck him to the left lower chest.

He was pronounced dead at 6.43am.

The hearing continues.
