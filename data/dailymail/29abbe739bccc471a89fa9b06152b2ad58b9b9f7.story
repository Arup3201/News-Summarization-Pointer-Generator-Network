Kim Kardashian, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter and Katy Perry are among the many well-known users of control pants - although it’s unlikely any of them will be shopping for them at Asda any time soon.

However, those women who aren't celebrities but still want to hold everything in are being directed by the supermarket towards its new Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner (BLD) pants costing £6.

The chain boasts that its product in the George clothing range is 'a UK first, featuring an intricate clasp fitting with three different settings’ and is designed to be worn all day.

Before and after: Asda boasts that its pants in the George clothing range are ‘a UK first, featuring an intricate clasp fitting with three different settings’ and are designed to be worn all day

Different settings: The supermarket has found its new Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner (BLD) pants costing £6 have been a big success, with it selling 70,000 pairs of control underwear this month

Asda said it has seen control wear sales rise by 40 per cent this month, and revealed a survey has found one in three women claim they cannot live without their control pants during the party season.

The supermarket added that it has sold 70,000 pairs of control underwear this month. Its BLD - a play on the LBD acronym for Little Black Dress – comes in sizes from ten to 22.

Helen Connolly, George buying director, said: 'Over-indulgence is inevitable at this time of year and we just want women to feel great, not guilty about celebrating with their loves ones.

‘We know from our sales that George customers love control wear and we're keen to keep innovating to meet demand. 

Another angle: Asda has seen sales of control wear increase by 40 per cent this month, and claimed a survey has found more than half of women admit to gaining about 4lbs over the Christmas period

Used them in the past: Reality star Kim Kardashian (left, in Los Angeles last week) and singer Katy Perry (right, in Sydney last month) are among the many well-known users of control pants

'We have seen a real appetite for a control range that puts comfort first, whilst still providing that unwavering support. Christmas is a time for enjoying yourself and these pants are perfect for doing just that while still looking fabulous.’

Singer Perry admitted in November 2012 that she 'almost always wears Spanx' because she cannot be bothered to go to the gym.

And in June 2012, reality star Kardashian’s control pants could be seen under her frock when she arrived at Los Angeles Airport – and she flashed them as she climbed into a car.

Back in 2007, Beyoncé's control pants were revealed when her thigh-skimming silver dress flicked up and revealed more than expected in Shanghai, China, as part of her world tour.

Other stars who have admitted to wearing control pants include actress Kristen Stewart, who inadvertently flashed them to the audience during an appearance on a U.S. talk show in 2011.

Leeds-based Asda, which has more than 500 UK stores, is owned by US retail company Wal-Mart.
