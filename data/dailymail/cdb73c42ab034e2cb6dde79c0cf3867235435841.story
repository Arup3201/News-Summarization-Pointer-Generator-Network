Part of a human skull has been found in a remote beauty spot by a shooting party travelling through woodland, police said today.

Officers have been searching the site at Sweeney Mountain near Oswestry in Shropshire since a group found the bones while hunting for pheasants.

Forensic tests suggested that the remains included part of a human skull, and they will now be subjected to carbon dating to determine how old they are.

Police have cordoned off a remote beauty spot after bones were found in the woodland

Forensic tests will now be done on the bones found at Sweeney mountain near Oswestry in Shropshire

Charles Roberts said he and his friends found the bones on Saturday during a pheasant shoot.

One of the party's dogs returned to the group with the bones instead of one of the shot birds.

He told The Shropshire Star: 'We donâ€™t know what they were really but it was suspicious enough that we informed the police.'

Mr Roberts said their dogs do not go digging so the bones must have been in the open.

Police searched woodland but said the results of the tests would not be known for 'some time'

Police were called to the scene on Saturday after the bones were found and a cordon was then put up

Detective Inspector Mark Bellamy said 
today: 'It appears to be part of a human skull, believed to be that of 
an adult male.

'It's possibly many years old but until tests have been carried out we cannot be sure.

'We will be carrying out further searches of the area to establish if there are any other skeletal remains.'

A spokesman for West Mercia Police 
said earlier: 'Searches will now be taking place in the woodland during the 
course of the day and forensic officers will be attending the scene to 
try to establish what exactly has been found.

'Although work is ongoing at the 
scene, the investigation into the discovery is at a very early stage and
 officers believe it is likely to be some time before they establish who
 or what the bones relate to.'
