There is always another saviour just around the corner. A serious player with serious money, seriously promising great things. An answer to the prayers of supporters.

Anyone willing to heed the multiple warnings from recent history, though, will know that a club in financial trouble is often prey to the worst kind of opportunist. And that many a potential white knight turns out to be anything but a source of stability.

The pattern is now well established. A club with a great history but pressing problems gets into trouble, is sold on or snapped up out of insolvency by one fast-talking ‘character’, then punted to someone a bit more low-rent, before eventually winding up owned by … well, let’s not go there.

Rangers have endured serious financial difficulties over the last decade, causing them to be relegated

Think of Leeds United. From Ken Bates to the impressive-sounding Gulf Finance House, then on to current owner Massimo Cellino. At least assuming the Italian doesn’t lose an impending court case, forcing him to sell on to AN Other.

Think, too, of Portsmouth. Now a beacon of hope, owned and run by supporters, they were passed through the hands of umpteen questionable characters before being saved by the fans.

Pompey Supporters Trust have actually engaged with their counterparts at Rangers regularly in a bid to provide help — if only by example — on the subject of a fans’ takeover, something that has failed to gain much traction around Ibrox.

Trust chairman Ashley Brown, who also serves as a director on board, understands that it’s a huge leap for any set of supporters to make. Until, that is, things get truly desperate.

Detailing the litany of disasters that befell his team before the community rallied, Brown told Sportsmail: ‘Our ownership tale is like a work of fiction, almost.

Rangers even had Lithuanian owners who now face an extradition order in connection with bank fraud 

‘We even had an owner that no one has been able to prove actually existed, although the belief is that he’s a low-level accountant working somewhere in the Middle East and his name was used by others.

‘More recently we had Lithuanian owners who are now under an extradition order in connection with hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud from Lithuanian banks.

‘The people we had to fight off at the very last moment, led by Keith Harris, included a guy whose father was subsequently assassinated — and he had to go into hiding himself.

‘There are countless examples of people who did own the club, or who we had to fight off, who came under all sorts of weird and wonderful categories. There were proven mafia connections in one case. Unbelievable.

‘I hope it doesn’t get as bad as it did for us — for any club in the country. But, if there is a key message I would give to Rangers fans, it is that it’s quite amazing how much power you can have if you work together.

‘We’ve spoken to people from the Rangers Supporters Trust. They’ve been keen to hear what we did and how we did it.

‘The biggest problem football fans in general have is that fans don’t tend to rally all in the same direction — until things are in such a tremendously dire strait.’

Some Rangers fans may still be waiting for Dave King, a potential saviour who told fans not to buy tickets

Many Rangers supporters may still be waiting for Dave King, one of the potential saviours who urged fans not to buy season tickets, dangling the carrot of increased fan involvement when — not if — he swept to power.

Until then, do supporters merely hope that one of the board-approved investment avenues being explored — an overseas backer here, a shares issue there — is enough to put everything back on an even keel?

‘It is natural for fans just to jump at someone coming in offering to pour money in,’ said Brown. ‘We know full well that there are plenty of fans out there who don’t care about the accounts and the bottom line.

‘They want a £5million striker — it doesn’t matter if the company is £150m in debt, as long as he’s scoring goals. There are a lot of fans who are happy to bury their heads in the sand until it’s too late.

‘Often you find that supporters who try to point out the reality of the situation are the ones accused of scaremongering — told to keep quiet and support their team. Until it’s too late.

If Rangers fans united, like Portsmouth supporters did, they might not have to rely on outside saviours

‘You have to remember one thing on any ownership, foreign or domestic. The idea of a Jack Walker, who says: “You know what, I’ve got quite a large bank account, I’m going to give a few million to my favourite football club because I love it so much”, that is incredibly rare.

‘Even the ones with money come in and effectively lend the club money — often at high interest rates. That’s something that we found, that the club was paying back loans way above commercial interest rates.

‘We had a series of poor owners, so the will to do something built up over the years.

‘We were also helped by the club being in administration. The last time it fell into administration for quite a long period, almost 18 months. That gave us a chance to do something

‘Often administrations are much shorter. The club is liquidated or yet another undesirable owner will come in, wave a few million pounds and take the club away again.’

If that sounds familiar, the current scenario at Elland Road will certainly ring a bell at Ibrox, Leeds United Supporters Club spokesman David Gaertner telling Sportsmail: ‘We’ve been through a few takeovers now. Ken Bates, then the Emirates lot, now Mr Cellino — who I do think has the best interest of the club at heart, even if he’s upset some people.

‘When these guys come around making the promises, it is easy for some supporters to grab at the hope.’

Portsmouth and Leeds suffered similar journeys

But Pompey fans united and now run their own club

If Rangers followed suit they wouldn't have to rely on outside 'saviours'
