The NYPD has for the first time released an interactive map that shows all serious crimes committed in the city - confirming the increased danger of living in a poor neighborhood.

Enabling New Yorkers to finally see how their street matches up against other boroughs, the map reveals that incidences of the seven major felony crimes - including murder, rape and robbery - are more common in neighborhoods where the average income is lower.

New York Police and the city's Information Technology and Telecommunications Department unveiled the new map on Sunday despite the force's insistence that the statistics have been available on their website since 2003.

Color coded: The darker the neighborhood precinct the more crime per thousand people is committed. From this map areas of Brookyln, The Bronx and Times Square Manhattan have experienced most violent crime since January

A comparison of this map based on 2010 Census Information and the newly released interactive crime map from the NYPD shows that shootings and murders are more prevalent in poorer neighborhoods of New York

However, despite the notable exception of Times Square, where the majority of crimes are petty robberies, most seriously violent crime occurs in Crown Heights, Harlem and the Bronx.

Indeed, last month NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly told the New York Daily News, 'Last year, 97 percent of all shooting victims were black or Hispanic and reside in low-income neighborhoods.'

However, some lower income neighborhoods in New York do not conform so readily.

Sunset Park, Borough Park and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn are relatively safe despite their average lower incomes.

Times Square: As expected Time Square is the crime hotspot of NYC - but suffers relatively little violent crime - with the majority of the almost 2,000 crimes reported since January 2013 being robberies

Details: The map can be enlarged to show as near to possible where each crime was reported. Larger circles mean multiple crimes were reported in the vicinity

And despite their reputations, Washington Heights and Inwood in upper Manhattan do appear to be safer than the public would give them credit for.

The launch of the map provides felony crime information for this past year, the current year and by next month within the current year.

NYPD Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said: 'With unprecedented population levels, New York City is safer than ever, with homicides on pace this year to fall below recent historic lows.

'This administration has relied on data to drive its crime fighting, and this map helps enhance New Yorkers' and researchers' understanding of where felony and violent crime persists.'

The public can search basic data on felony crime occurrence by address, Zip Code, or police precinct and displays all recorded crimes at the nearest street or intersection to the reported location.

Filters can be applied to the map which shows crimes per 1000 residents as a shaded map which is graduated in color to dark where incidences are highest.

Commissioner Kelly said the city is safer than ever, but the map helps New Yorkers and researchers understand where major crimes persist.

Previously, the only crime data posted online were weekly reports broken down by precinct, but they weren't posted in the form of an interactive map.

Before his mayoral election victory, Bill de Blasio had criticized the NYPD for its failure to respond to one-third of freedom of information requests.

The map is part of a new city-wide law requiring all government data to be made available online.
