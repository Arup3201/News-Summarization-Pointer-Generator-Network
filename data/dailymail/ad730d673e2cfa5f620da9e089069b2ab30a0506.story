A woman who was caught on CCTV performing a sex act on a man in a lift has had her privacy complaint rejected by Ofcom after it was shown on television.

The mother, who was drunk at the time, was seen in footage on Channel 4 show CCTV: Caught on Camera – Lift Watching, in a lift in a Southampton tower block. 

One clip showed, briefly, the complainant, Ms K, performing a sex act on a man. Show producers said she and the man's faces were heavily blurred and neither of them were named.

But the woman, who later became pregnant, complained that her loved ones were still able to recognise her and she claimed the stress caused by her embarrassment had prompted a premature labour.

However, regulator Ofcom has ruled that the public interest in anti-social behaviour outweighed her expectation of privacy.

The programme began with an montage of clips taken from the CCTV footage. 

Accompanying footage of Ms K performing a sex act on a man in a lift., one CCTV operator said: 'Us humans, we are disgusting sometimes'.

Further on in the programme, more CCTV footage of Ms K in the lift was shown. 

This part of the programme began with the CCTV operators discussing the drunken behaviour that they witnessed, particularly on Friday and Saturday night, when a second CCTV operator said: 'Every Friday night, there will be couples going out of the lift dressed up.

'And they will be coming home at some point.

'And they'll be coming home in a state, whether that's drunk, angry, cuddly, loving, sex. It, there is always some sort of state'.

In response, Channel 4 said that this was not a private occasion, as it had occurred in a lift

CCTV footage of Ms K and a man entering a lift and then Ms K performing a sex act on him was shown. 

The CCTV operator then said that when people are having sex in a lift: 'they don't give a s**t about the camera, they don't care about the camera. He's got his leg up and he's as happy as Larry'. 

The CCTV footage then showed the man leaving the lift and fastening up his trousers. 

A third CCTV operator was shown at this point admitting that she herself had been caught having sex in public.

The Ofcom ruling said: 'Ms K complained that her privacy was unwarrantably infringed in the programme as broadcast because CCTV footage of her engaged in sexual activity with a man in a lift was included in the programme without her consent.

'Ms K's face was obscured in the programme; however, she said that friends and family had recognised her from the footage and that the programme had negatively affected her social relationships and her employment prospects. She said that the stress of being recognised in the programme had caused her to go into premature labour. Ms K also said that at the time the CCTV footage was filmed, she had been very drunk and that she had not been 'at the best point in her life'.

In response, Channel 4 said that from the outset of the CCTV: Caught on Camera series it paid careful attention to the issue of contributor privacy, but that this was not a private occasion, as it had occurred in a communal lift.
