A ghostly figure has been caught on camera standing outside Parliament on New Year's Eve.

The spooky image shows a transparent figure dressed in modern clothing gazing out over the Thames near Westminster Bridge in London.

Professional photographer Jules Annan took the image on New Year's Eve  - but only noticed the ghostly apparition when he got home.

Ghost? A photographer thinks this strange figure, circled, he captured on New Year's Eve could be a ghost

He said: 'Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I can't explain it.

'There was no one there when I took the photograph and it is not a double exposure or a long exposure.

'I have shown it to five or six other people and they cannot explain it either.'

Among the experts he has consulted is paranormal investigator Lee Roberts, owner of Haunted Events UK.

Spooky: The image up close. Paranormal experts say the figure is either a ghost, or someone tampering with the image with editing software

He also believes it can not be explained by camera error and says it is either paranormal activity or someone tampering with the photographs using editing software.

'I can explain 99 per cent of these photographs but he [Mr Annan] has found a live one here - or a dead one, as it were,' he said.

'He says he hasn't tampered with it, so to me this is a good piece of evidence [of ghosts].

'People always think ghosts have to be a Victorian woman holding a baby - but if there are spirits out there then they should include people right up to the present day.

'You can get spirits from hundreds of years ago but also some from fairly recently.'
