Train punctuality has tumbled to its lowest level for two years - and railway officials do not expect to meet their targets for arriving on time until the end of the decade.

The admission comes despite the announcement of plans to invest £37.5billion into the rail network - which will require several more years of inflation-busting price hikes.

According to data released by Network Rail, train punctuality has never consistently reached its target of 92.5 per cent, and stood at just 85.3 per cent in November/December 2012.

Just two of the 15 private rail operators hit the punctuality target in the latest period, with several - particularly those running long-distance lines - recording figures of no better than 80 per cent.

Punctuality: The blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month-by-month; the red line shows a moving annual average; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule

The figures record a train as being late if it is more than five minutes behind schedule for a short-distance service, or 10 minutes for long-distance.

Alternative statistics measuring how often trains arrived within one minute of their scheduled time show that just 57.1 per cent of service are precisely on time - a number falling to 41.9 per cent for long-distance services.

When NR announced its development plans for 2014-19, it admitted that the 92.5 per cent target would not be met until the end of that period.

The company resisted pressure to set a more ambitious target - and warned that 'increasingly congested' trains would make it hard to make any further progress on punctuality.

Expansion: New plans to upgrade Britain's train systems have been announced by Network Rail

'We want to do better than that, but we are facing up to some problems that come with success - that is, more trains and more passengers on an increasingly congested network,' a spokesman said.

'Even the smallest delay at busy times can cause a ripple effect which disrupts passengers several hours later, hundreds of miles away.'

Despite the failure to increase the number of trains arriving on time over the past two years, NR's plans for Britain's trains assume that fares will continue to rise by one per cent above inflation.

Its scheme for the next seven years was announced yesterday, just days after most fares went up by an average of 4.2 per cent.

A top railway official said the plan was dependent on fares rising each year at a rate of one per cent above the RPI inflation rate, and added that any change to that assumption would require a larger subsidy from the taxpayer.

The subsidy is instead scheduled to fall to no more than £2.9billion by 2019, down from £4.5billion a decade earlier.

Tight squeeze: NR hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute

Given the size of the national deficit and the Government's commitment to fiscal austerity, ministers are unlikely to reverse their course on reducing the subsidy.

The NR plan for 2014-19 will provide 170,000 extra morning commuter seats at peak times, including a 20 per cent increase on services into central London.

The firm also envisages 225million more passengers per year travelling by 2019, and 355,000 more trains in service.

Specific projects include various electrification schemes, such as the Great Western and Midland Main Lines, station improvements at Birmingham and Reading, and reopening 31 miles of railways in Scotland closed under the Beeching cuts 50 years ago.

NR chief executive Sir David Higgins warned that the railway network had 'entered an era of trade-offs' and would have to compromise over the various demands made on it.

'Increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure, run trains on time and cut costs, and in many areas choices will need to be made,' he said.
