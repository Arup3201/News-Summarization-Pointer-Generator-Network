A Sydney mother-of-two who defended her decision to open up about her job as a high-class escort even though she has potentially exposed her young children to ridicule says her work is empowering for women.

Former journalist Amanda Goff, whose working name is Samantha X, said going public about her career and making her children, aged five and seven, vulnerable to school yard bullying was no different to children of gay parents who faced the same hardships.

'Children are teased mercilessly every day and their mother does not have to be working in the sex industry,' the 40-year-old said.

The high-class escort, who goes by the name of Samantha X, was a former journalist who worked for New Idea and InStyle

She spends one week as a full-time mother and the next at a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD as Samantha X

Ms Goff has two children under the age of seven who she shares custody with her former partner

'I think the world is changing. My kids are in classes with kids that have gay parents, lesbian mothers, they’re not ridiculed.'

She talked candidly about her profession as a sex worker to spruik her novel, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, on Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

Ms Goff told the program she volunteered at the tuckshop of her children's school and most of the parents there knew what she did for a living.

She has worked as a journalist at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines, but now she charges $800 an hour for her services or $5,000 for an entire night.

Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with her former partner - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X.

Amanda Goff has hit back at criticism of her parenting skills after she publicly announced she works both as an escort and in her children's school canteen

'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff said.

Ms Goff said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex.

'I haven’t had sex for ages actually... I’m like a naked therapist,' she told Kyle and Jackie O's radio program Kiis on Monday.

'A lot of men have told me about putting their dogs down and I’ve wiped away a lot of tears. They’re paying for my time, so what they do in that time is really up to them.

'I have champagne and beer but they often want a cup of tea.

'It is an empowered job for a woman and I think we all have the right… as long as we’re not hurting anyone.'

The 40-year-old believes her decision to come out as an escort was not a 'big bloody deal' when it came to affecting her children

Ms Goff (pictured here three years ago) used to work at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines but is now a private escort

The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two and started escorting in 2012, two days after she visited a brothel

Ms Goff (left in 2010 and pictured right in the front row, far right in 2009) said most of the parents at her children's school know what she does for a living and are supportive

Ms Goff also claimed that her current job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones

The escort recalled one incident where she was rushing to pick up her children at school and was sitting outside in her car when a client with a foot fetish messaged her, asking for a picture of her toes.

The 40-year-old said she made a decision to come clean because she wanted to be free, saying she did not think it was 'such a big bloody deal', adding: 'Who am I hurting?'

Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms Goff said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book. 

'I didn’t wake up one day and say I’m going to write a book about being a hooker. I’ve thought about this very carefully, I’ve been seeing a child psychologist for a year,' she said.

The escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012

'My kids know that mummy is a journalist… they know she makes sad people feel happy and they know she’s creative and wrote a book. That’s all they need to know at the moment.'

Despite the stigma surrounding the profession, the escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 after visiting a brothel during her lunch break while she was still a beauty editor for a magazine.

Two days later she was paid to have sex with men at an exclusive brothel in Sydney and 18 months later she moved into private escorting as Samantha X.

But her parents - who live in a middle-class suburb in England - and her former partner were not as enamored with her new career path.

Ms Goff's parents told her she was 'disgusting' when they found out the truth and her ex-husband's response was: 'Are you effing serious?'.

'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff tells Sunday Night reporter James Thomas (pictured)

Goff charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her services, and said she can teach married couples a thing or two

A former colleague of Ms Goff told Daily Mail Australia they were not surprised to learn of the woman's double life.

'I'm not shocked at all - she's always been a bit close to the edge. She follows her own rules.

'And I'm not surprised she's going on TV and saying it's her - I think she's always secretly wanted to be famous,' the colleague said.

'I think she's always wanted a life that's bigger than what she had. To be famous and rich. And using something to catapult her into the limelight.

'She's always been very bold and goes for what she wants. She's very single-minded. I always thought she used her looks and her boldness to get what she wants.'

After her time sleeping with married men who pay her more than three times the average weekly salary, she says she knows the secret to a happy marriage.

Ms Goff said listening was key as many men complained they were not being heard to by their spouse.

She said she did not think that her clients sleeping with her were committing adultery because she gave her clients an outlet to escape from their normal lives and they could go home as happier husbands.

Ms Goff said most of her clients did not see it as straying from their wives because there was no emotional commitment.
