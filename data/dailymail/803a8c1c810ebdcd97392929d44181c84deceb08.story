A new GCSE in cooking and nutrition will be launched in a drive to boost the nation’s skills in the kitchen.

Teenagers will be helped to ‘understand and enjoy British and international cuisines’ as well as learning how to develop their own recipes.

The course will place a strong emphasis on practical cooking techniques in contrast to current food-related GCSEs which require candidates to complete tasks such as designing food packaging.

Pupils will also learn about the scientific principles behind food and nutrition and how to cook healthily

The Government has already made cooking and food education compulsory for pupils aged five to 14 in a new national curriculum being implemented this term.

The new course will cater mainly for 14 to 16-year-olds and aims to merge key content from the current three GCSEs which cover food or cooking. These are home economics, design and technology with food technology and hospitality and catering, which are expected to be discontinued.

It will also include new content on the scientific knowledge underlying cooking and food preparation.

The move follows a proposal from exams watchdog Ofqual for GCSEs which overlap to be phased out to maintain confidence in the system.

Minister for School Reform Nick Gibb said: ‘At the heart of any food qualification should be a focus on developing practical cookery skills and a strong understanding of nutrition.

‘That’s why we’ve created the cooking and nutrition GCSE so that rather than designing food packaging, students will now learn the essentials of food science, nutrition and how to cook healthily.

‘This qualification will give young people the preparation they need to succeed in the food and hospitality industries as well as giving them vital life skills.’

Henry Dimbleby, said: ‘This qualification is another big step forward for food education in this country'

The new GCSE aims to give pupils in-depth knowledge of nutrition, food choice, where food comes from as well as the ability to apply this knowledge when cooking.

It could lead on to higher food-related qualifications including apprenticeships in the catering or food industries

The proposed content for the new GCSE was developed with input from experts including the authors of The School Food Plan.

Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of Leon and co-author of the plan, said: ‘This qualification is another big step forward for food education in this country following the introduction of cooking as compulsory in the curriculum this term for all children up to the age of 14.

‘I particularly like the new emphasis on understanding and enjoying British and international cuisines and encouraging students to develop their own recipes.

‘It is a serious qualification that will be another step towards creating a healthier and happier society.’

Ministers also announced that design and technology GCSE will be revamped with input from experts such as those from the Dyson Foundation. It will have ‘cutting edge content and product design’ at its heart, the Department for Education said.
