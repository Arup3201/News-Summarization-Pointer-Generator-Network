If your job involves working in the ‘death industry’ - be it as a funeral director or a mortician - how do you find like-minded people to talk to about what you do on a daily basis?

Working in such professions can make smalltalk a bit of a conversation stopper, but one website has come up with the answer. 

Named ‘Dead Meet’, the site helps people who work in the death industry meet others with similar 'interests' - letting the conversation flow onto darker topics without the fear of scaring the other person off.

Dead weird? A dating website for people in the 'death industry' is now online (screenshot shown). Created by London's Carla Valentine, it boasts more than 5,000 members. It is intended to be used by people in the death industry like funeral directors, anatomists, taxidermists and so on

People looking for love sign up to the website and then chat with like-minded people to arrange going on a date - very similar to other dating sites already in existence.

The website was created by Carla Valentine after she became frustrated at her attempts to date people not in the death industry, she told Vice.

Apple’s HealthKit app is designed to help you get the most out of life by improving your well-being and fitness. But could it also be used to predict when you’ll die?

That’s what a new app called Deadline is claiming, saying the tech can be used to predict exactly when you’ll kick the bucket.

The morbid app uses a variety of data including your blood pressure, height and sleep pattern to come up with the prediction that is apparently accurate to the second.

‘You're going to die. Sorry, we all do eventually,’ company Gist LLC writes on their iTunes.

However, according to Gizmodo, the app’s claims of being accurate are not entirely true, instead being just ‘a genetic algorithm that forecasts your death’. 

One of the key problems she found was that it was generally frowned upon to talk to ‘normal’ people about work if you’re a crematorium technician, anatomist, taxidermist and so on.

Being a museum curator herself who deals with dead specimens all day, she said this made it difficult for her to hold conversations when out with friends a potential love interests. 

‘I just wanted to be able to chat to someone who could really understand me,’ she said.

‘I wanted more friends in the same profession, not just my co-workers, and perhaps even a partner to talk to in the wee small hours of the night.

‘When asked, “How was your day?” I wanted to be able to say how it really was, safe in the knowledge that uttering sentences not usually uttered by "normal" people wouldn’t send someone packing.’

Ms Valentine said she already has more than 5,000 members, and there are also regular meet-ups around the world for local members to get to know one another.

'I have great comments on there from members saying they’re really pleased someone has started a site like this,' Ms Valentine added to MailOnline.

'It is meant to be for those within the profession but there is a section for "researcher" or "student" because there may be people who want to get into the industry and want to talk to others about how to do so.

'It’s also so that people who hold events can find death professionals to speak at them, if that’s what they’re looking for.'

People can sign up and chat with others online to arrange a date. It was created to give people in the industry more chances to meet a potential partner without spooking them off such as crematorium technicians, anatomist, funeral directors and so on (stock image shown)
