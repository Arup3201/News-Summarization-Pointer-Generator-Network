Macklemore has released a statement to say he had not intended to resemble a Jewish caricature when he donned a 'random' costume for a Seattle show last week.

The rapper was branded 'anti-Semitic' after he appeared on stage at Seattle's Experience Music Project Museum wearing a long black wig, thick beard and large nose on Friday night.

But in a statement he released on his website on Monday night, he said that he had simply chosen random items to wear so that he could disguise himself while walking around at the secret show.

'Disguise was the intention,' he explained. 'I wasn't attempting to mimic any culture, nor resemble one. A "Jewish stereotype" never crossed my mind.'

Speaking out: Macklemore, pictured, has said it was not his intention to resemble a Jewish caricature when he donned a 'random' costume for a secret show in Seattle on Friday night

Offensive? He wore a long wig, long beard and large nose, which some branded 'anti-Semitic'

He added 
that some people thought he looked like Ringo Starr or Abe Lincoln, 
while he thought he looked like Humpty Hump - a rapper - 'with a bowl 
cut'. But he realized others had since not agreed.

'I
 respect all cultures and all people,' he explained. 'I would never 
intentionally put down anybody for the fabric that makes them who they 
are. I love human beings, love originality, and ... happen to love a 
weird outfit from time to time.'

He said he recognized that he hadn't made the wisest choice of costume.

'I acknowledge how the costume could, 
within a context of stereotyping, be ascribed to a Jewish caricature,' 
he wrote. 'I am here to say that it was not absolutely not my intention,
 and unfortunately at the time I did not foresee the costume to be 
viewed in such regard.

'I'm saddened that this story, or any of my 
choices, would lead to any form of negativity... I truly apologize to anybody that I may have offended.'

After 
images of his performance appeared online, some Twitter users branded him
 anti-Semitic and even actor Seth Rogen, who is Jewish, attacked the 
musician, writing: 'First you trick people into thinking you're a 
rapper, now you trick them into thinking you're Jewish?'

Following the backlash, Macklemore tweeted that the costume had simply been a 'random' collection.

'A fake witches nose, wig, and beard = random costume,' he wrote on Monday morning. 'Not my idea of a stereotype of anybody.'Â 

Rogen 
responded: 'Really?? Because if I told someone to put together an anti 
Semitic Jew costume, they'd have that exact shopping list.'

Macklemore, 30, performed the show with Ryan Lewis. Both are originally from Seattle and have been celebrated for their progressive messages.

The duo gained widespread fame with a 
message supporting diversity, and their hit song 'Same Love' calls for 
tolerance and support for members of the gay community.

The two also performed the song at January's Grammy Awards while several same-sex couples were married.

Lewis and his mother appeared on Anderson Cooper's show on CNN to talk about their HIV-AIDS charity efforts before Macklemore posted his message Monday night.

In a postscript on his statement, the rapper pointed out the work of the Anti-Defamation League, providing a link to the group's website. The ADL was formed to fight anti-Semitism.
