Carl Cooper thought he was doing a public service by offering seven benefits claimants the chance to work for him.

But the company boss was flabbergasted when none of them turned up on the first day.

Astonishingly, not a single one even had the courtesy to tell the marketing firm boss they would not be coming in.

Empty desks: Businessman Carl Cooper today slammed 'work shy' Britain after seven of his new recruits failed to turn up to their first day of work yesterday because it was raining

Mr Cooper and other staff members called the new employees to ask them 
where they were. Initially, some refused to answer their phones  when 
they recognised the number calling them.

When the staff finally got through, five said they would be better off 
staying on state benefits rather than doing the commission-based work.

Four of the seven also claimed  torrential rain had put them off.

One was unhappy about the prospect of paying a £5 train fare and another called at 12.45pm and said: 'Oh, sorry – I overslept.'

The saga illustrates the problems of enticing many young people to work, even at a time of recession and high unemployment.

Yesterday Mr Cooper, who runs Car Smart, a marketing firm for 
independent car dealers in Canterbury, Kent, criticised the benefits 
system and said it rewarded people for doing nothing.

He added: 'I was 
left stunned when none of the new recruits turned up for work. They are a
 bunch of workshy layabouts.

Mr Cooper with his job advert. Astonishingly, some of those who failed to show up told him they would be better off staying on state benefits - and could not be bothered to spend £5 getting to work

'These are people who are so morally twisted that they would rather stay on the dole than work.

'People keep saying there are not enough jobs in the UK but the real 
problem is that there are not enough determined or ambitious people.

'The benefit system is too generous and encourages the unemployed to stay unemployed and just breeds more laziness.'

Mr Cooper, 26, placed adverts for sales positions on the JobCentre 
website, which is run by the Department for Work and Pensions.

Those claiming benefits must apply for a certain number of jobs each 
week and attend any job interviews they get to ensure they keep 
receiving handouts.

Claimants must also take up jobs offered to them, unless the conditions of the work do not 'fit their circumstances'.

Mr Cooper said all his employees received a basic retainer of £100 a 
week initially and are enrolled on to the company’s commission 
structure, which could see earnings rise to up to £400 a week.

The jobseekers who failed to turn up will not lose their benefits because the basic pay is under the minimum wage.

Unemployment in the UK dropped slightly this month to 8.3 per cent, down from a 12-year high of 8.4 per cent.
