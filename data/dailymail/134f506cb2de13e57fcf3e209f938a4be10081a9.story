Cristiano Ronaldo moved to within one goal of Raul's Champions League scoring record with his opening strike against Liverpool on Wednesday night.

The Portugal star had failed to score at Anfield in all of his previous five visits, but made no mistake with a neat half-volley in the 23rd minute.

It took Ronaldo's European tally to 70 goals, one off that of Madrid favourite Raul but just one ahead of Barcelona rival Lionel Messi.

2. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) 70

3. Lionel Messi (Barcelona) 69

5. Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barca) 50

'I’m going to beat his record, whether now or another night,' said Ronaldo. 'Messi is very close too. It’s a team win, we have nine points so 75 per cent of the qualification is done.'

Real's 3-0 Group B victory was the Spanish side's eighth win on the spin, with Ronaldo scoring in every game since La Liga kicked off in late August.

The 29-year-old was applauded by some sections of the home support when he was substituted in the 75th minute; with even the Anfield faithful prepared to recognise his remarkable feats. 

'It was special,' said Ronaldo. 'It was my first goal at Anfield and I feel very happy. Very proud. We knew before the game that Anfield is a difficult place, but we played fantastic football – especially in the first half, and we deserved it.’ 

Meanwhile, in the Premier League, Liverpool continue to stumble post-Luis Suarez.

They have dropped 11 points already this season and recent victories over West Brom and QPR were not without their scares.

Some supporters were pointing to Ronaldo’s record against them as reason for optimism, following his previous scoring drought at Anfield. But now his sights are trained on a different record.
