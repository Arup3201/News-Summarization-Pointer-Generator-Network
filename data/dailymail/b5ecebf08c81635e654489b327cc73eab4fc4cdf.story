The crowded season of sports awards is one ceremony lighter this year with a glittering FA event quietly kicked into the long grass.

The FA England Awards were launched with much ballyhoo at St George’s Park two years ago, with gongs for all age groups and Steven Gerrard voted player of the year. There was even a prize for the best England newspaper reporter in honour of the late Brian Woolnough.

However, there was no such function last February because England were fully focused on their World Cup preparation. And the woeful performance by Roy Hodgson’s side in Brazil is the primary reason why a big England bash is not considered appropriate for 2014.

The FA say the first awards night was part of the FA’s 150th anniversary celebrations and they did not commit to an annual event — although that was the strong impression given at the time.

The England men’s and women’s 2014 player of the year plus the Under 21 choice are collecting votes on the FA website.

Meanwhile, the Sports Journalists’ Association British Sports Awards, held yesterday at the Connaught Rooms in London, has a long tradition. But the ever-declining number of current sports stars who attend makes it debatable whether the lunch is worth sustaining in its current guise.

The nadir came when interviewer Sybil Ruscoe, charged with chatting to the ‘great names of sport’ in the room, started with the England Rugby 2015 spokeswoman.

James Taylor has been in superb form, hitting 68 on Wednesday as England beat Sri Lanka in an ODI

England's in-form one-day batsman James Taylor has the strength of character to survive Kevin Pietersen saying he would be better off as a jockey. But Taylor does have to make one allowance for his 5ft 6in stature. He cuts an inch-and-a-half off the top of his short-handle bats to stop them catching on the ground when he drives the ball.

British rugby already looks to be in danger of missing out on a proper challenge for the Olympic rugby sevens in Rio, which would be a major lost opportunity to grow the format.

RFU chairman Bill Beaumont needs to decide how to take Rugby Sevens forward for the 2016 Rio Olympics

England, charged with qualifying, are struggling to get into the top four of the world group while coached by the low-profile Simon Amor, with the formation of a GB side still at the paperwork stage. So a combined GB team will have neither enough preparation time nor competitive games to mount a realistic challenge.

Ben Ryan, regarded as a top sevens brain, has been lost to Fiji, while the word inside Twickenham is that RFU chairman Bill Beaumont is lukewarm on sevens since losing the last IRB chairmanship election to France’s Bernard Lapasset, who champions the format and led the successful bid for an Olympic place.

The RFU say forming a GB team is a complex process and Beaumont is a fan of sevens.

Sergey Bubka was supposed to be challenging Lord Coe for the IAAF presidency next year

Sergey Bubka looks to be holed below the waterline before he has even officially declared himself a challenger to Lord Coe for the IAAF presidency. Bubka has had close links for years with Russian federation chief and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, who stepped down from the IAAF board yesterday after being heavily implicated in covering up a serial Russian doping scandal. That, and other explosive revelations in a German TV documentary, are being investigated by the IAAF ethics committee.

England coach Peter Moores (left) takes his Test side to the West Indies next April at the same time of the IPL

Sky Sports already promoting the Indian Premier League, which starts in April, helps demonstrate why Test cricket is in crisis.

England’s series in the West Indies that same month looks like it will be contested by a second-XI home side, with their best players wanting to maximise IPL earnings.

And if England do well in the World Cup, they will have to go straight from that tournament to the Caribbean — such is the crazy scheduling — and some mainstays of the side will have to be rested.

A series in the West Indies always attracts a lot of England fans, so the ECB have an obligation to ensure the travelling supporters are not short-changed by substandard Test line-ups.

Coincidentally, new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison comes from IMG — agents for the IPL.
