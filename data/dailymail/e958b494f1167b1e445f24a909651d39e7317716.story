Alan Pardew believes Newcastle United now have the attacking options to frighten the Premier League's top four – while new signing Remy Cabella insists the club can end their 46-year wait for a trophy.

The Magpies have brought in seven new players for this season and Pardew, having survived a torrid end to the previous campaign, is in optimistic mood.

His side struggled for goals and failed to score in 12 league games from January onwards as fans called for the manager to be sacked.

But owner Mike Ashley has backed his boss this summer and France international Cabella has been joined at St James' Park by Siem de Jong, Emmanuel Riviere, Facundo Ferreyra, Jack Colback, Daryl Janmaat and Ayoze Perez.

United finished 10th last time around but Pardew is now far happier with his offensive personnel and has hailed their activity in the transfer market.

'I think we have done some terrific business this summer. It must please the Newcastle fans that we have signed some exciting, offensive players,' he said.

'And, for me, I feel far more comfortable with the team and that we can play a brand of football that is expected of us.

'It is very difficult for the likes of the teams outside of the Champions League money to compete. But we are trying to do it in an educated manner.

'We've been accused of not spending the money we bring in, but now we have spent it and we can hope to get as close as we can. Certainly, offensively we are definitely stronger. There is no doubt about that.'

Cabellea – a £12m arrival from Montpellier – scored his first goal during Sunday's 3-1 win over Schalke in Germany.

And he is already eyeing the silverware which would signal the club's first since 1969.

'I hope we can win a cup this season. We play for that to win a trophy,' he said. 'There is a good feeling in the team at the moment and my adaptation is good. I have friends who are French and I am very happy to be here. I am just waiting for the first game now.'
