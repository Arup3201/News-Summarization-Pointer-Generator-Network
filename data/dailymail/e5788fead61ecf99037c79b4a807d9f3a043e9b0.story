A Life of Promise: Gabrielle Swaison,15, is an honor roll student and cheerleader at Ridge View High School in South Carolina. She is also a guitar player and tap-dancing virtuoso

A teenage South Carolina cheerleader 
has vanished from her home in a mysterious circumstances that have baffled authorities.

The 
FBI has joined the hunt for Gabrielle Swainson, a 15-year-old Ridge View
High School honor roll student, guitar player and tap-dancing virtuoso 
who disappeared from her second-story bedroom during in the early hours of August 15.

Elvia
Swainson, Gabrielle’s mother, has reportedly said that she woke her 
only child just prior to leaving for work around 3:30 am on the 
morning in question, gave her daughter her cell phone, and watched as 
the young girl rolled over in bed and fell back to sleep. 

It
was the first time that Elvia Swanson had ever left her daughter alone 
in the house that early in the morning. The pair had reportedly stayed 
up 'really' late the night prior watching movies and riding out a 
late-night thunderstorm.

When
Elvia Swanson reportedly returned from her office around 7:30 am she said her daughter's bed - as well as their house 
at 221 Tamara Way - was devoid of any sign of the 5-foot-2-inch tall 
African-American girl with black hair.

The
panicked mother said she found none of her daughter's clothes - or 
other personal affects - missing from her room, or the house. Those 
possessions include her purse, as well as her cell phone's charger.

Besides her daughter, the only other 
thing missing from the room was the actual cell phone, which Elvia 
Swanson immediately tried dialing. The phone, she has reportedly said, 
eerily rang a few times and then stopped during that initial attempt, 
and then, on successive attempts, went directly to voicemail. 

'I
panicked,' Swainson told The State of south Carolina. 'My first thought
was someone came in here and took my child, she’s not normally up this 
early.'

A 
neighbour who lives across the street from the Swainsons said Elvia 
Swainson came to his house about 7:15 a.m. Saturday to ask if he’d seen 
her daughter.

“She (Elvia Swainson) was upset,” Robert Platts, 49, told The State.

Four Hour Window: Gabrielle's mother returned home around 7:30 a.m. and found her daughter's bed empty, as well as the cell phone gone. No other personal affects, including her purse and wallet, had disappeared

Eerie Moments: Elvia Swainson called her daughter's cell phone and listened to it ring several times before it stopped. Successive calls went directly to voicemail

Platts, who with his wife, Tammy, has 
reportedly known the Swainsons for years said mother and daughter were 
always together and tose times in the afternoon when Gabrielle was home 
alone, she sometimes had girlfriends over - but that was it.

The
Swainson's house, located in the 100-house North Crossing 
neighbourhood, is within a mile of the Village at Sandhill mall. The 
State reports that the neighbourhood also backs up to the sprawling, 
mostly undeveloped Clemson Institute for Economic and Community 
Development campus off Clemson Road.

Gabrielle
has never run away, her mother told The State, and she didn’t think her
daughter had any reason to vanish of her own accord on that particular 
Saturday.

The teen had 
reportedly just made Ridge View High’s junior-varsity cheerleading team,
and she was excited to start her sophomore year of classes Thursday, 
the mother has reportedly said.

'I just want my daughter back,' Elvia Swanson told The State.

Now the entire community, as well as local police - and the FBI - have joined the hunt for the missing girl.

A Morning of Firsts: The 15-year-old girl had never run away from home before, and had never been left alone that early in the morning by her mother

A Community Mobilized: Loved ones and friends have taken to the streets to hand out leaflets with Gabrielle's photo. The teen was days away from starting her sophomore year in high school

In
addition to handing out leaflets and flyers, community members have 
donated $6,000 for information leading investigators to Swainson or to 
the arrest of anyone involved in her disappearance, The State reported.

Of the $6,000 in reward money offered, $2,500 is from an anonymous donor and another $1,000 comes from CrimeStoppers.

'I would never wish this on any family,' Gabrielle’s aunt, Tara Swainson, told the State. 'You don’t know how to cope.'                                           

The South Carolina paper reports
that The Richland County Sheriff has activated his major crimes unit – a
team of veteran investigators that had replaced the missing persons 
unit that initially handled the case.

Sheriff Leon Lott told The State he is highly concerned about the 15-year-old girl’s vanishing with no trace.

'We’ve
put our best people on this,” Lott reportedly said in an interview. 
'We’re going to work this like it’s something bad, in hopes that it 
turns out to be something good.'

The family has also hired a private investigator to aid in the hunt.

Chandra
Cleveland-Jennings tells ABC News, 'Her purse was still there with her 
charger for her phone in it and all the ingredients of her purse like 
her wallet and her credit card, everything is still there.'

Cleveland-Jennings
also told ABC News there has been no activity on the teen's phone since
her disappearance. Police have reportedly not said whether they have 
been able to locate a signal from the phone.
