Burnley are expecting such a low crowd for Monday’s FA Cup third-round tie at home to Tottenham that one of the stands at Turf Moor has been completely shut.

Attendances for the club’s Premier League games at home this season are around the 20,000 mark. However, it is understood that approximately 6,000 tickets had been sold by Sunday, with a quarter of those being bought by Spurs fans.

More than 35,000 watched the two teams play in the league at White Hart Lane a fortnight ago, but Burnley anticipated poor ticket sales for this game and took the decision to close the Jimmy McIlroy Family Stand some time ago.

Sean Dyche and Burnley will host Tottenham Hotspur at Turf Moor in their FA Cup third round clash

BURNLEY (probable, 4-4-2): Gilks; Reid, Keane, Mee, Trippier; Kightly, Jones, Marney, Wallace; Sordell, Jutkiewicz. 

TOTTENHAM (probable, 4-2-3-1): Vorm; Dier, Chiriches, Kaboul, Davies; Capoue, Stambouli; Dembele, Paulinho, Townsend; Soldado. 

Even though this is the club’s first FA Cup tie at home in four years, the poor response has been blamed on the game being moved to a day when many people are just returning to work after Christmas.

The move brought an angry reaction from fans’ groups, although Burnley are still expecting a healthy number of supporters to buy tickets on the day.

Chief executive Lee Hoos has defended the decision to play on a Monday and close the stand, claiming the decision was made with police and stewarding resources in mind as well as the fitness of Sean Dyche’s squad.

He said: ‘There are a lot of fixtures over the Christmas and New Year period and to maximise player recovery time, Monday is an optimal day to play.

‘We are sure that the long-term goal shared by all fans is to have a full squad capable of being competitive in all competitions. With regard to the Family Stand closure, this is based purely on the historical lack of demand for tickets for cup matches in the early stages. 

'If supporters purchase enough tickets to indicate there is a demand for opening additional stands for this game, we will happily open the stand.’
