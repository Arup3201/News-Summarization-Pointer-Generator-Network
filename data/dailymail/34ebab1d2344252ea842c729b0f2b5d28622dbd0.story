A coroner has accused a council of ‘gross failings’ after a housebound pensioner with dementia died when she was left without food and medication for nine days.

Social workers did ‘absolutely nothing’ to help Gloria Foster, 81, after the care agency which visited her four times a day was shut down by immigration officers.

An inquest heard that council staff failed to find replacement carers because they assumed Mrs Foster would do it herself because she was well-off enough to fund her own care.

In fact, Mrs Foster was never told that her care provider, Carefirst24, had been closed down by the UK Border Agency.

Eventually a nurse visited her home to carry out a pre-scheduled blood test in January last year, and found Mrs Foster suffering from dehydration, starvation and bed sores. She died 11 days later at Epsom Hospital, in Surrey.

Yesterday, Richard Travers, senior coroner for Surrey, said the case was a ‘grave indictment’ of Surrey County Council’s adult services department. ‘The failure to provide even the most basic needs can be regarded as a gross failure,’ he added.

Mr Travers said he intended to send his report to the Care Quality Commission and to write to the council’s chief executive with concerns about staff training and communication procedures.

Concluding that Mrs Foster died of ‘natural causes contributed by neglect’, he said: ‘The council ought to have known here was a woman in receipt of care four times a day which naturally included night time care.

‘What is plain is absolutely nothing was done about providing Mrs Foster with alternative care. The gross failure to provide Mrs Foster with the care she required during that period contributed to her death.’ The task of finding replacement care for Mrs Foster and other Carefirst24 customers fell to social worker Elizabeth Egan, who left the inquest in Woking in floods of tears yesterday.

She told the coroner last week she was struggling to cope with her workload at the time and was suffering from ‘burn out’. She admitted she had ‘failed’ Mrs Foster.

The inquest heard Mrs Egan told senior managers ‘everything was in hand’, yet Mr Travers ruled in his closing remarks that there had been no ‘balances and checks’ to ensure Mrs Foster had been catered for. He said there was a ‘general assumption’ that those who fund their own care would make their own arrangements.

In 1967 Gloria married Shell accountant Bob Foster, but just four years later, he was killed in a motor accident in Saudi Arabia. Mrs Foster, from Banstead, Surrey, never remarried or had children

After the verdict was delivered, Mrs Foster’s friend Ann Penston said of Mrs Egan: ‘Social workers are caring people. She has to live with that mistake. I do not have any animosity towards her.’

The council has already implemented new protocols following a Serious Case Review.

A spokesman said: ‘We would again like to say how sorry we are for our failure to help Gloria Foster get the support she needed. We should have done more and we completely accept that.

‘While we have already made changes we’ll continue to do all we can to prevent anything like this happening again.’ Keen golfer Mrs Foster was described as ‘glamorous and vivacious’ by friends. Her father was an Army officer in India, and she went to an English private school.

After her family moved back to Britain in 1947, she became a secretary for oil company Shell.

In 1967 she married Shell accountant Bob Foster, but just four years later, he was killed in a motor accident in Saudi Arabia. Mrs Foster, from Banstead, Surrey, never remarried or had children.

The married owners of Carefirst24 (above being raided by UK Border Agency) appeared at Croydon Crown Court last week accused of illegally employing workers without visas
