A Turkish man in jail for murder has slit his wife's throat with a fruit knife during a prison conjugal visit.

Metin Avci, 33, and his wife Leyla Avci, 29, were given a bowl of fruit with a knife for their private meeting at the prison in the city of Sivas, Turkey.

But Avci used the knife to cut her throat, before using it to try and take his own life, it was reported.

Prison officials allowed the couple, as is customary in Turkey, a several hours-long private meeting in the conjugal room.

After failing to take his own life, he was found alive and was immediately hospitalised, the Dogan news agency reported.

Already part way through a 15-year sentence for murder, he now faces another murder charge.

The pair were meeting under controversial conjugal visit legislation, enacted in 2010, that allows private visits from anywhere up to 24 hours, AsiaOne reported. 

Turkish authorities have admitted the country is grappling with the issue of femicide - a hate crime generally considered to mean the killing of women because they are female.

The issue rose to prominence in recent weeks after the body of Ozgecan Aslan, 20, was found burned near woodland in Tarsus.

It's alleged she was killed after trying to stop a man from raping her - triggering protests across Turkey that were attended by thousands.

Her death caused outrage particularly because women are frequently killed at the hands of violent men and are seen as having a lower status.

This perception was recently inflamed by comments made by the Turkish president who said women were not equal to men.
