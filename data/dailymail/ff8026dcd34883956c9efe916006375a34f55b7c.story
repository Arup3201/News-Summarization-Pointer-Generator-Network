A teenager who was planning her own funeral is enjoying a new lease of life thanks to a life-saving double lung transplant.

Casey Blunstone,16, was told by doctors that she had just days to live as cystic fibrosis had caused her lung function to drop to dangerous levels.

For the past ten years she had been confined to hospital as a result of her debilitating condition and operated on twenty times.

Casey Blunstone was given just days to live but is now looking forward to a bright future following a life-saving double lung transplant

She was top of the transplant list for her height, age group and blood type but no suitable donor could be found and her family launched an appeal.

And with days left news came that a match had been located and Casey, from Walgherton, Cheshire East, underwent a ten-hour transplant procedure at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in London.

She 
is now looking forward to a bright future and medics expect a full recovery.

Her mother Gaynor, 48, said that the family were overjoyed when a match was discovered.

She said: 'We were really desperate at this stage.

'It was a nerve-wracking wait to find out whether we had a match because the live donor was no longer an option.

'But we were told the lungs were in pristine condition.'

Road to recovery: For the past ten years Casey had been confined to hospital

Casey was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was four-weeks-old.

The disease affects the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, causing them to become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.

She previously had to spend 20 
hours-a-day hooked up to a ventilation machine at Crewe’s Leighton 
Hospital.

But it was when her lung function fell to a dangerous 16 per cent that she was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital and medics located a suitable donor.

She said: 'When I found out that my transplant could go ahead I was just overwhelmed.

'I have been waiting so long for a donor that I was in shock at first because I didn’t think it was going to happen.'

The teenager is now appealing for others to join the donor register so that more lives can be saved.

She added: 'The first thing I thought after my operation was that I want people to keep donating their organs.

'I have been really poorly, but I was given another chance at life and that is all I want for those who are still suffering.'

Over four days she managed to recruit more than 300 people to 
join the Organ Donation Register and is now set to become an 
advocate of Live Life Then Give Life - a national donor charity.

Her brother Tom, 25, described how he had been inspired by her efforts.

He said: 'She has been ill all of her life and it has been hard work for 
her. But she just keeps going and has always stayed positive.'

She is now hoping to join her friends at school full-time after years of missing classes.

Cystic fibrosis is a common inherited disease causing recurrent chest infections, poor growth and related health problems, such as diabetes and infertility.

It affects over 8,500 children and young adults in the UK, where five babies are born with the condition every week.
