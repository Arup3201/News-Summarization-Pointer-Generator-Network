In a surprise jailhouse interview just hours after a jury began deliberating her fate, Jodi Arias spoke out about her murder trial, her many fights with her legal team and her belief that she 'deserves a second chance at freedom someday'.

Arias repeated many of her claims from previous interviews, testimony on the witness stand and her statements to the jury earlier on Tuesday as she pleaded for mercy.

Her further stints of self-promotion came as the jury were unable to reach a decision on Wednesday on whether Arias should be sentenced to death.

The judge sent the jury back out to deliberate until 4.30pm (MST). If jurors are unable to agree, then the judge will declare a mistrial for death penalty phase only and a new jury will be brought in.

She also provided some new information 
about her case and how she believed her lawyers let her down by not 
calling more witnesses who could have bolstered her claims that she was a
victim of domestic violence at the hands of Travis Alexander.

Arias was convicted last week of first-degree murder in the June 2008 stabbing and shooting death of her one-time lover in what prosecutors described as a cold, calculated killing carried out in a jealous rage. Arias has maintained all along it was self-defense.

he jury began deliberating Tuesday as they worked to determine whether she should live or die for her crime. If the jury opts for a life sentence, the judge will have the option of determining whether she spends the rest of her days behind bars or is eligible for release after 25 years.

Arias acknowledged it was unlikely she would ever be released, but believed she deserves a second chance.

Following her conviction last week, she told a local TV station that she preferred the death penalty. 

She said on Tuesday night that she changed her mind after a tearful meeting with family members that same day, realizing that her death would only cause them more pain.

'I felt like by asking for death, it's like asking for assisted suicide and I didn't want to do that to my family,' she said.

Arias said she fought from the beginning to keep cameras out of the courtroom to limit the media spectacle, and believes that the jury should have been sequestered. She stated flatly that she did not receive a fair trial.

'The prosecutor has accused me of wanting to be famous, which is not true,' she said.

If Jodi Arias receives the death penalty, she will become only the fifth woman sentenced to death in Arizona since 1973.

As of January this year, there were 63 women on death row in the U.S. - accounting for 2 per cent of the death row population of 3,125 people.

In the last century, more than 40 women have been executed, including 12 since 1976.

The last woman who received the death penalty was Teresa Lewis of Virginia on September 23, 2010.

She received the lethal injection for murdering her husband and stepson in 2002 in order to claim life insurance. 

Although Arias's trial has drawn global attention for the brutal killing of boyfriend Travis Alexander, twisted lies and sordid details of sex, there is much gruesome competition among previous death row inmates.

Serial killer Aileen Wournos of Florida was executed by the state of Florida in 2002 after being sentenced to death a decade earlier.She admitted to murdering seven men all of whom she said had raped her while she worked as a prostitute.

Her story was turned into a 2003 Oscar-winning movie, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as her lesbian lover. 

However, Arias has sought the spotlight at every turn, providing TV interviews and even using a third-party to tweet throughout the trial.

Arias repeated her claims that she never wanted to go to trial in the first place but instead wanted to reach a deal with prosecutors on a second-degree murder count that would have carried a maximum of 22 years in prison. However, she said, 'no deal was offered'.

She gave the interviews on Tuesday after the judge lifted an order barring jail officials from arranging any media requests.

The judge did not elaborate on the 
reason for the ruling, but Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office 
quickly began making the media arrangements that lasted late into the 
night.

A shackled Arias wore makeup for the 
interviews and showed up in a jail classroom with a comb in hand as she 
fixed her hair for the cameras. When pressed for details on some of her 
conflicting stories, she was mostly evasive, citing advice from her 
attorneys and possible pending appeals.

She was also asked about the conflicts she had had with her two court-appointed lawyers, Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott.

Arias said she wanted at least three 
people called as witnesses who could have testified to having seen 
bruises on her neck 'when I was choked out' by Alexander but she said 
she was rebuffed by her lawyers.

The prosecutor insisted her claims of self-defense were an exaggerated attempt to avoid being convicted.

She
said her lawyers 'felt a little betrayed' and blindsided by her 
post-conviction interview but that they gave their blessings for Tuesday
night's interviews, warning her to be cautious.

Arias
said she sometimes wishes she'd never met Alexander, 'just because of 
how ultimately everything ended and I say that for his sake and mine - 
not just a selfish thing'.

She said if the attack never occurred and she never crossed paths with the victim, she would likely now be a happily married 32-year-old with children, good finances and a successful wedding photography business.

Earlier on Tuesday, Arias told jurors she planned to use her time in prison to bring about positive changes, including donating her hair to be made into wigs for cancer victims, helping establish prison recycling programs and designing T-shirts to raise money for domestic abuse victims.

Arias became emotional as she 
displayed for jurors photos of her friends, boyfriends and family 
members, including newborn relatives she has met only from behind bars.

She asked jurors to reject the death penalty for the sake of her family.

'I'm
asking you to please, please don't do that to them. I've already hurt 
them so badly, along with so many other people,' she said. 'I want 
everyone's healing to begin, and I want everyone's pain to stop.'

Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, shot in him in the forehead and slit his throat, nearly decapitating him, before leaving his body in his shower to be found by friends about five days later.

'To this day, I can hardly believe I was capable of such violence. But I know that I was,' Arias told jurors. 'And for that, I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life.'

Her speech to jurors came a day after her attorneys asked to be removed from the case, saying the five-month trial had become a witch hunt that prompted death threats against a key witness in the penalty phase. They also argued for a mistrial. The judge denied both requests.

Alexander's family showed little emotion as Arias' mother, father and sister looked on from the other side of the gallery and cried.

After Arias finished speaking, Judge Sherry Stephens explained to jurors that their finding would be final

The jury heard closing arguments later on Tuesday, with Willmott citing Arias' mental health problems and lack of a criminal record among the reasons to spare her life.

'The question now before you is: Do you kill her? Do you kill her for the one act that she did, the one horrible act, or can you see that there is a reason to let her live? Can you see that there is value in her life?' she said.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez said that despite Arias' claims, there were no factors in the case that would warrant a sentence other than death.

He implored jurors to look at the 'whole panorama' of the case, not just Arias' statement on Tuesday, and explained how Alexander's family will live with the pain of their loss for the rest of their lives.

'They can't forget that what happened on that afternoon, Travis Victor Alexander suffered immense physical pain,' Martinez said. 'They can't forget that.'
