When mother-of-three Nicola Brightey tells people her children are triplets they can’t believe it.

Triplet sister Elizabeth arrived into the world five years behind her brothers - but they were all conceived at the same time.

The threesome have made the family complete for Mrs Brightey and her husband Kevin, who have tried for a staggering 15 years to have children.

They had to turn to IVF to help them in their mammoth battle - and it has cost nearly £20,000 to have the triplets.

She said: ‘It is amazing to think my triplets were born five years apart. People can’t believe it when I tell them that they were all conceived at the same time.

‘James and Daniel couldn’t wait to meet their triplet sister - and now they are ever so protective of her.

'We have waited so long to have our children - but now our family is finally complete after all this time.’

The couple, who live in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, started trying for a family after they got married in August 1998.

When nothing had happened after four years, Mrs Brightey went to visit her GP.

Tests then showed that her fallopian tubes were blocked through scarring and she would need fertility treatment.

Mrs Brightey, 35, a sales executive, said: ‘I had peritonitis at the age of 15 and doctors told me that it had caused extensive scarring on my fallopian tubes.

‘It meant that I couldn’t conceive naturally which was devastating, so I knew that the only way that we would ever be able to have a baby was to have IVF treatment.’

After three years of saving, the couple underwent their first course of IVF treatment at CARE Fertility in Nottingham in October 2007. But that failed, leaving them devastated.

Mrs Brightey said: ‘The cycle failed completely as I only produced one egg, which was devastating.

‘We had saved for so long and had pinned our hopes on the treatment. So to not even be able to go ahead with the rest of the treatment was heartbreaking.’

The couple began their second course of IVF in January 2008 and this time Mrs Brightey managed to produce 14 eggs.

Eight were fertilised and two were put back into her womb. The remaining six were stored in the freezer.

Two weeks later, Mrs Brightey made the thrilling discovery that she was pregnant.

She said: ‘It was wonderful news. We just had to hope that everything would go smoothly.’

The twins were born safely in November 2008 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn, James weighing 5Ib13 and Daniel weighing 6Ib13.

Mrs Brightey said: ‘It was so emotional when they were born and when I was holding them in my arms, it was the most amazing moment. After all those years we were finally parents at last.’

The couple decided to save up for more IVF treatment and try and have another sibling for the twins.Mrs Brightey said: ‘We really wanted to try for another baby and we thought that it would help the twins‘ social skills if they had another sibling to consider.’

So last February the couple went for their third course of IVF treatment.

One embryo was taken out of the freezer and defrosted, but it didn’t survive the process.

The second embryo defrosted and was successfully put back into Mrs Brightey’s womb.

She said: ‘We didn’t have two put back because we already had twins. Amazingly I found out I was pregnant again, which was thrilling.’

Baby Elizabeth was born in November at Peterborough City Hospital weighing 6Ib14.

Mrs Brightey said: ‘Elizabeth looked identical to the boys when they were born - they all looked like three peas in a pod.

‘And people can’t believe it when I tell them that they are triplets.

'When they see the boys they ask if they were IVF and when I tell them that Elizabeth is actually their triplet sister, but she has been born five years later, they are amazed.

‘The boys have really taken Elizabeth under their wing. They adore their triplet sister. They have such an incredible strong bond between them, but they have let Elizabeth in there too.’

Dream come true: The Brighteys have battled for 15 years to become parents to three children through IVF

The triplets have cost the couple nearly £20,000, but they say that they are worth every penny.

Mrs Brightey said: ‘For years I never thought that we would ever be parents, and it has been such a long battle to have our triplets.

'It has taken 15 years and nearly £20,000 but it has been worth every penny.

'I feel like the luckiest mum in the world.’
