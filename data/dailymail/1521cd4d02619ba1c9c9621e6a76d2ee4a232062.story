David Beckham revealed his wife and children persuaded him to end his football career in America.

The former England captain today said he had signed a new two-year contract with LA Galaxy because his family - wife Victoria and four children - were happiest living in America.

Beckham, 36, who turned down a massively lucrative deal from Paris St Germain, admitted: ‘When you’re married and you have children, your priorities change.’

Meet and greet: The sportsman answered questions from the crowd about his life and career

The multi-millionaire sportsman said 
things had changed since his days as a rising star at Manchester United 
when he and Victoria were not married and they both had more freedom to 
focus on their careers.

‘It was a lot easier for us to make decisions based on our careers,’ he said.

‘We have three amazing boys and a little girl we have to look after so now our priorities are all about them.’

The couple’s sons, Brooklyn, 12, 
Romeo, ten, and Cruz, six, are settled at school in Los Angeles, while 
their daughter Harper was born there last July.

Beckham added: ‘My family are 
happiest here at the moment. We love living in LA, we love living in 
America. We’ve adapted to the culture and everything the country has.’

And the star joked that he was 
relieved to sign his new contract with LA Galaxy because he needed to 
fund Harper’s bulging wardrobe.

Thrilled: Beckham takes to the microphone to address questions at the press conference

‘Her wardrobe is ridiculous already,’ he grinned. ‘I’m glad I got a two-year contract.’

Beckham was speaking in an interview 
streamed live online, which took place at Google’s headquarters in 
Mountain View, California.

The former Manchester United star had
the audience in stitches as he was asked him whether he listened to 
Spice Girls music to get him motivated for a game.

He quipped: ‘The Spice Girls? Of course. ‘Wannabe’ always gets me going before I go on!’

But he quickly added: ‘Spice Girls is not on the playlist. It’s on my iPod but not on the playlist.

‘I’m a huge Jay-Z fan. I’m a huge Stone Roses fan, who are getting back together in June - just plugging then.

“Certain managers at certain clubs 
don’t like music in the changing room before a game. Most players end up
listening with their headsets.”

Beckham squirmed as he took questions
live from the Google office in London, via a videolink, and was asked 
whether England or the USA were more likely to win a World Cup.

He said: ‘That’s a terrible question to ask me when I’m sat here.’

‘I’m going to have to say England. 
I’m really sorry. I’ve got a lot of respect for US players and the US 
team but I believe at some point England are going to win a World Cup.

‘We’ve got a lot of talented players in our country, we’re very passionate and it’s where the game began.’

Beckham also revealed how he plans to travel to Africa when he retires from football, to coach underprivileged children.

‘I need to be passionate about something I’m going to go into,’ he said.

‘People always ask me if I’ll go into
coaching when I retire. I love coaching but I’d love to go into the 
field to places like Sierra Leone, to Africa, to see the kids and coach 
them.’

Family takes priority: It is believed Beckham turned down a move to Paris St Germain because he didn't want to move his family to France

Speaking about a previous trip to 
Sierra Leone, he said: ‘These kids are walking about with literally no 
clothes on. But you arrive, put a soccer ball in front of them and they 
play like my kids play. That’s what soccer can do.

‘It can change people’s lives. It can take them away from the lives they’ve got every day. That’s the power of soccer.”

But he revealed that he planned to play football for as long as he could.

‘Every time I step on the field I’m like a little kid. Once that changes, that’ s when I’ll feel I’ll have to stop,” he said.

‘Until that changes I’ll keep playing for as long as possible - as long as teams are offering me new contracts.’

In action: Beckham's five-year deal with LA Galaxy expired last month, but he will now be with the team for a further two years

He added: ‘It’s different now with kids - there’s fame and fortune. I’d still be playing this game even if I wasn’t paid for it.

‘Not that I don’t want to be paid for it, but I’d still be playing this sport,’ he laughed.

Beckham gushed about his wife, 
Victoria, and their four children - Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper, 
describing his family as his ‘proudest possession.’

The father-of-four said he loves 
taking his sons to play football and practise taekwondo, and still can’t
believe his luck in having a baby daughter.

He said: ‘With boys you can throw them up and they just drop and get up and run around.

‘I’m changing her diaper and thinking
I can’t believe I’ve got a girl. Everything about her is feminine - the
way she moves, eats, smiles.

‘Naturally the first word is going to be ‘Momma’. She’s close to it already, she’s saying a few things.’

‘The best thing about it is she’s got three older brothers and a dad,” he added protectively.
