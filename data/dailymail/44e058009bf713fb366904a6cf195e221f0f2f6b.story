Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan has faced mounting criticism about the introduction of Universal Credit

The government’s flagship benefits overhaul is costing £225,000 per person to introduce, new figures show.

The much-delayed Universal Credit combining six benefits into one has so far cost £612million.

Iain Duncan Smith once claimed 1million people be receiving the payments by April this year, but with just six months to go there were only 2,720 signed up.

The Universal Credit project has suffered a series of setbacks, with ministers forced to admit the target of having all new and existing claimants on Universal Credit by 2017 will be missed.

Labour claimed that if the project had stayed o track the cost per person signed up by now would be only £612.

But employment minister Esther McVey revealed in response to a parliamentary question that the scheme has so far cost £615million from 2010 to 2014.

This included £100million in 2011-12, £320million in 2012-13 and £192million in 2013-14.

However the timescale for adding people to the hugely complex system has repeteadly slipped.

Chris Bryant, Labour’s shadow welfare minister, said: ‘Iain Duncan Smith's flagship policy has been plagued with delay after delay from the outset and millions of pounds have been wasted.

‘We were once told universal credit would be on time and on budget and that a million people would be on the system by April this year, but this has come to nothing.

‘It is staggering that the government has spent £225,000 per person on this project.’

Universal Credit will combine Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and housing benefit.

Whitehall's spending watchdog has said the Department for Work and Pensions failed to achieve ‘value for money’ in its development and needed to adopt ‘realistic expectations’ on the timetable for its delivery.

The National Audit Office warning came after Mr Duncan Smith admitted that more than £40 million spent on IT for the project had been written off in 2012-13.

A further £91million of bespoke software will become defunct when the system is operational in 2017, although the department insisted this was ‘not a write-off’.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude was forced to deny reports of a rift with Mr Duncan Smith over the project, but said its initial implementation had been ‘pretty lamentable’.

Amid mounting criticism, in December Mr Duncan Smith angrily denied the scheme was in chaos, telling the Commons work and pensions committee: ‘There is no debacle on Universal Credit.’

But trouble-shooter Howard Shiplee, who was brought in this year to rescue the £2.4billion scheme, said it still faced major challenges in dealing with all but the most straightforward benefit claims.

He said the automated system could not currently deal with claims involving couples or children. A tiny pilot scheme involving just 2,000 people had focused almost exclusively on young single men, whose claims are straightforward.
