The massive event held to grant a five-year-old cancer victim his dream of becoming 'Batkid' for the day cost the city of San Francisco $105,000, it has emerged.

Last Friday, Miles Scott emerged from a Batmobile to see the streets transformed into Gotham City before he battled his fiercest foes. He was then presented with the key to the city.

It was this final stop, which was held at the Civic Center and co-starred Mayor Ed Lee, that was the costliest of the day, SFGate reported.

Lee had initially planned simply to take a break from his duties and present Miles with the key, assuming a few hundred volunteers would want to attend.

But after the story became an internet hit, as many as 14,500 people showed up at the venue and led to a much larger production, including massive TV screens and professional staging.

The city will cover the costs with money charged to conventions that use the Moscone Center, SFGate said. These funds are used for other city-wide events, such as the Fourth of July fireworks.

Police Chief Greg Suhr said there had been no extra costs to the police department, despite some officers taking part in arresting the 'baddies' of the day.

'The cops you saw were all on regular duty,' he said. 'All we did was move them around from one part of the city to another, like we do with any number of events during the year.'

As many as 12,000 people had turned out to help make Miles' wish - granted the the Make-A-Wish Foundation - come true, and millions more watched on from around the world, including President Obama, who tweeted in support of the brave Batkid.

The 
President also employed another form of social media in honor of Miles, 
using Vine to tell him, 'Way to go, Miles! Way to save Gotham!'

Senator Dianne Feinstein also tweeted: 'Thanks for saving Gotham, Batkid!'

As
Miles worked his way around the city, crowds of San Franciscans lined 
the streets to watch his heroics. First, he rescued a damsel in 
distress, then he foiled a dastardly plan to rob the bank by the 
Riddler, and his third challenge was to rescue mascot Lou Seal from the 
clutches of the Penguin.

Patricia
Wilson of the Make-A-Wish Foundation paid tribute to the hundred of 
people and thousands of well-wishers who made Miles' wish come true.Â

From
a special edition of the Gotham City Chronicle to a 
Batmobile, there was nothing Wilson could not procure for the little 
superhero.

'It might be the first time a Lamborghini has had a booster seat,' she joked.

Wilson said that every person she called to make Miles' wish happen wanted to help.

'Every time I picked up the phone, I got a yes. And it was followed by a question: How else can I help?' she said.

For Miles' parents, from Sikiyou County, his day as Batkid symbolizes a new beginning for Miles, who is in remission after battling leukemia since he was one, and the Scott family.

'This
is closure for us. He finished treatment in June, it's been a long 
three years for us. So this is one way to kick it off,' said father Nick
Scott.
