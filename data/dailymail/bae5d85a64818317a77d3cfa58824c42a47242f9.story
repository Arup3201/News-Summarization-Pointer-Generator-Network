A man in Glasgow was given an unwelcome surprise while cleaning his kitchen - when he found a huge tarantula lurking behind the oven.

The hairy Chilean rose tarantula, which can have a leg span of up to six inches, was hidden behind the appliance before the man spotted it scuttling across the ground.

But while the sight of the creeping intruder would send many running away screaming, the man remained calm and used a glass and a piece of cardboard to keep the creature cornered.

Hairy and scary: The tarantula that crept out from behind the oven in Glasgow. The man who found the spider remained calm enough to corner the creature with a glass and piece of cardboard

He then phoned the Scottish Society for the Protection of Animals who arrived to remove the animal safely.

The spider is now being looked after by staff at the Glasgow 
Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre, where staff have named it Incy.

Chilean rose tarantulas are popular pets and staff at the centre believe that it could have escaped from a nearby flat. They are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

'It's possible the tarantula belongs to someone in a nearby flat and we'd really like to return him home if he has gone missing.

'If no-one comes forward we'll find him a new owner who understands his needs.'

Anyone who recognises the tarantula is being asked to contact the Scottish SPCA centre in Glasgow on 03000 999 999.

The Chilean rose tarantula, native to Northern Chile, is one of the most popular species to be kept as a pet.

The spiders, which can have a leg span of up to about 5 or 6 inches, can be kept in an enclosure that is just 18 inches long.

Though generally considered a docile species, the Chilean rose tarantula can be skittish and has been known to escape from enclosures or quickly creep out of sight when it senses danger.

Those who keep them as pets are warned to keep their enclosures tightly shut.

Chilean rose spiders have not been kept as pets long enough to accurately say how long they can live for, but it is thought that female spiders live between 15 and 20 years - with some living more than 20 years.
