These are the absolutely shocking scenes where a young woman is left unconscious during a vicious fight inside a Dublin pizza restaurant. 

The woman, who is from England, was visiting Dublin with a group of friends in fancy dress when they went into the Apache Pizza restaurant in the popular tourist destination of Temple Bar.

One customer of the restaurant becomes involved in a heated discussion with a member of staff behind the counter, when a man from Dublin intervenes and the pair start grappling.

A fellow customer steps in and tells the man that he would be willing to 'see him outside' 

Within seconds, both men start fighting while several customers begin filming the incident 

Several customers try to split up both men, including the woman's boyfriend, as they start exchanging blows in the middle of the restaurant. 

The woman gets carried along on the outside of the group of men and slams the back of her head on the tiles after she falls over. 

For several seconds, nobody notices that the girl is unconscious as the two men continue trying to hit each other. 

The English guy is knocked to the floor and the Dublin man appears to try and stamp on him as the fight continues. 

Several of the customers film the drama on their mobile phones. 

Eventually, several people notice that the girl is in trouble and one woman tries to lift her from the ground, only to lose grip and leave her head crash against the tiles for a second time. 

As the chaos continues, one person calls out for an ambulance, while a man, dressed like a zombie, leans over the girl claiming that 'that's my woman'. 

The Dublin guy has been ushered out of the restaurant to be followed out by the man dressed as a zombie and the person involved in the original fight. 

The fight took place in Apache Pizza on Dame Street in Dublin in the heart of the main tourist district

The zombie man shouts at the Dublin guy 'that's my woman, you ****,' and tries to punch him.

The fight continues on Dame Street, which is only yards away from the world famous Trinity College on the edge of Temple Bar. 

Since the video was uploaded onto the internet on Thursday it has started to go viral.  

A spokeswoman for An Garda Siochana, the Irish police service, said they have no reports of the incident.

Dublin Fire Brigade, who provide an ambulance service for the city, said they could not comment on the girl's condition.
