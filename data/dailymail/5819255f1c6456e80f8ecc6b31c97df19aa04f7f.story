You're top of the Bundesliga tree by 11 points, projected to win the title in the coming months, so there remains plenty of time to spread some Christmas cheer.

Bayern Munich's squad of stars, including Thomas Muller, Arjen Robben and Xabi Alonso, took part in a sing-along, wishing their supporters a merry Christmas. 

Singing in English, the video shows the team going along to 'we wish you a merry Christmas' as fans from around the world help out, too.

Bayern are comfortably 11 points ahead of Wolfsburg in Germany, and 30 ahead of second-bottom Borussia Dortmund, who may not be having quite as cheerful a Christmas this time around.

Pep Guardiola's men next play against second-top Wolfsburg on January 30, with no Boxing Day fixtures for those in Germany, as we have in the Barclays Premier League.

Bayern are now relaxing for the holidays after beating Mainz 05 2-1 six days before Christmas.
