Fleeing court: David Lowe was seen running from court with his face covered as protesters demanding he was jailed set up a picket line

A pet owner who starved his dog so badly she looked like a 'walking skeleton' from a 'concentration camp' was forced to flee court by campaigners angry he was allowed to walk free.

David Lowe, 33, neglected 15-year-old Fly until the animal was less than half her normal body weight, but avoided jail because he had shown 'remorse'. 

Bolton Magistrates' Court heard when the tan-coloured Lurcher was rescued she was barely breathing and had to be put down.

Lowe of Farnworth, near Bolton, Greater Manchester claimed he had money troubles and blamed his ex-girlfriend for failing to feed Fly, but was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

Yesterday he had to face a crowd of demonstrators from across the UK who raised a 20,000 name petition calling for him to be jailed.

But magistrates said although Lowe's behaviour passed 'the custody threshold' they suspended the 12 week sentence for 18 months due to his 'remorse.'

He was banned from keeping animals for life and will only be able to appeal against the order in 25 years time.

Police were called to patrol the demonstration outside the court and Lowe ran away with his face covered.

After the case, Lorraine Edwards, 41, who runs a Lurcher Rescue centre in Hertfordshire said: 'All we wanted was justice for Fly but the current justice system is not doing enough. This man should have gone to jail because he a let dog die.

'The maximum sentence he could have faced was six months but people should get a lot more than thar for neglecting animals in this way. What happened to him is a normal example of the courts being lenient to animal cruelty cases.

'There was just no need to let a dog starve and this case has really pulled on the heart strings of people. We feel very passionately about it because the courts are so lenient.

'Because Fly is no longer around we have to make a stand for her by being the voice for her to let the magistrates know this case is totally unacceptable when there's so many people who can help. It's disgusting.'

Another protestor said: 'He starved that dog so much she looked like something out of a concentration camp. The fact he went free from court is outrageous.'

Emaciated: The vet who examined Fly said it was the worst case he had seen in his 30-year career

Shocking: The Lurcher incredibly thin and had to be put down because she was injured and struggling to breath

Poster: 'Monster' Lowe avoided jail because of his mental health problems and the remorse he had shown

Pain: Fly 'suffered immeasurably' at the hands of her owners and showed real bravery to last as long as she did, the court heard

Earlier Tony Stock, prosecuting said the investigation began in October last year after an RSPCA officer Insp Vicki McDonald went to Lowe's flat and saw Fly lying down in its basket by the side of the kitchen.

Mr Stock added: 'She was immediately shocked by how emaciated the dog was. The defendant confirmed the dog was his but said his former partner had been responsible for the dog as well.

'He went on to tell the inspector that his ex as he called her had asked him to put the dog down but he did not want to do that. He added that he was surprised the dog had lasted as long as it had.

'He said that Fly had last seen the vet a few months ago. He went on to tell the inspector that the dog had only got so bad in the last couple of weeks and attributed most of the dog's problems to the fact she was old.'

But vet Angus McKenzie said in a statement he felt Fly 'was the most severely emaciated dog dead or alive that he had ever seen in the 30 years he had been in practice.' The dog was 12-15 per cent dehydrated and weighed just 8.1kg which is less than half her ideal body weight.

The dehydrated dog, was diabetic, had overgrown claws, signs of a tooth abscess, a mammary tumour, and severe advanced dental disease.

Upset: Dozens from all over the UK came to the court to 'demand justice for Fly'

Vigil: The protesters said that Lowe should have been jailed for the crime and said the justice system is failing

Message: This banner was one of several tributes to the the tragic Lurcher

Police presence: Greater Manchester Police was called in to deal with the situation yesterday

Mr Stock added: 'Fly was is a dog severely emaciated and the photographs show the quite graphically.

'Given the number and severity of the issues affecting Fly - all of which could have been treated - it was Mr McKenzie's feeling that the only humane action was to put her to sleep.

'The dog suffered immeasurably which the vet described as the totally neglect of the defendant. The vet called Fly 'a walking skeleton.' In his opinion that suffering could have been alleviated at an earlier stage.

'That dog could have lived a healthy life if advice and treatment had been sought.'

Insp McDonald went to interview Lowe but he claimed he had not 'committed any offence.' The court heard he had been given £20 to take his dog to the vets when she became so poorly but he failed to do so as he feared it would be put down. 

In mitigation Lowe's lawyer Peter Leather said his client had mental health problems and claimed Fly became neglected when he split up with his girlfriend and was left homeless. 

Passing sentence JP Dr Derek Tate said: 'The custodial threshold has been crossed but we are going to suspend the sentence. This is clearly because we believe a rehabilitative element would be more appropriate in your case.

Lowe will be ordered to pay £1,000 costs and an £80 victim surcharge at the rate of ten pounds a week. The vets fees of £528 will be paid by the taxpayer.

RSPCA inspector Ms McDonald said after the case: 'This is the most serious case of malnutrition I have ever seen. It was hard to believe that she was still alive. Individually each condition could have been treated but together it was kinder to put her to sleep.

'I understand that it's that difficult to let go of a dog you have had for years but you can't leave them to get into this state. It is unacceptable and heartbreaking.'
