Side-by-side with a Government minister in the House of Lords, this is the millionaire hotelier accused of making huge profits turning a suburban London street into a refugee camp.

Indian businessman Gauhar Nawab, 73, has reportedly negotiated a deal to be paid £500,000 of taxpayers’ money to cram nearly 800 asylum seekers into his 98-room hotel.

As a result of the block booking, prices for other guests at the three-star Euro Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace have been pushed up by more than 500 per cent.

There were serious questions over the deal on Friday as it emerged he has twice in the past three years been photographed being entertained in the House of Lords by a junior minister.

Mr Nawab, who lives with his wife in a £2million mansion, is seen posing at Indian community events with Baroness Verma, Conservative Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change.

In October 2012, Baroness Verma hosted an award ceremony for the Non-Resident Indians Welfare Society Of India, of which Mr Nawab is international president.

At a similar event the following year, guests including Mr Nawab were offered personal tours of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

He is also the patron of the India International Foundation – which supports Indian culture in the UK – alongside Labour MP Keith Vaz.

On Friday, the Mail told how the Euro Queens Hotel is being used as a makeshift camp for refugees who have made their way to Britain from countries including Eritrea, Sudan, Syria and Pakistan.

A council inspection has found the 98-room hotel has an astonishing 791 asylum seekers in residence. They are crammed up to nine to a room while they wait to be processed by the Home Office.

It emerged on Friday that the hotel is owned by Mr Nawab, a businessman and socialite who owns the Euro Hotels Group – which is worth around £6.7million.

He and his wife Athar, 69, have been accused of making huge profits from the refugee crisis – apparently negotiating a four-month deal with a Home Office provider earning them an estimated £500,000. 

Prices for regular customers at the hotel have also shot up, with a double room advertised yesterday for £333, compared to the usual price of £49.

Crammed: Asylum seekers gather outside the three-star Queens Hotel in Crystal Palace, London

Mr Nawab and his wife live in a huge seven-bedroom detached house in Tooting – three miles from the Euro Queens Hotel – where they have two male housekeepers.

This week, there were two cars outside, including a Daimler Super V8 Jaguar with a personalised number plate.

But there has been fierce opposition from residents as Mr Nawab has attempted to expand his business empire.

Local MP Steve Reed, who has taken up the case with the immigration minister, said: ‘I am furious. The hotel is on the edge of our shopping centre in a highly residential area.

‘It seems highly inappropriate to place so many asylum seekers in an area like this without proper consultation, planning or preparation.’ 

A resident yesterday added: ‘I feel for the refugees... but having hundreds in a small hotel and spilling out on to our street... is not acceptable.

‘The owners want to keep expanding to do this more. They are making millions and our front gardens have turned into a refugee camp.’

The asylum seekers were placed in the hotel by private contractors Clearel under a Home Office scheme. A spokesman for Clearel declined to comment.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure... We have instructed our providers to cut substantially the number staying at the Queens Hotel, and to cease further bookings there by the end of the week.’

A spokesman for Baroness Verma denied links to Mr Nawab, adding: ‘There are no business links between them at all. A lot of businessmen come to the House of Lords.’

The Nawabs declined to comment yesterday.
