Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta is determined his side will not end this season trophyless, as they did the previous one, and believes that their front three will fire them to the title.

The attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez has not quite hit the heights that were expected of them this year, but Iniesta believes they are the best in the world.

And the Spaniard also insisted that the squad are not even considering going another campaign without any silverware, after Atletico Madrid pipped them to last season's La Liga crown.

Andres Iniesta says that Barcelona are not even considering going another season without a trophy

Barca missed out on La Liga last season, ending without any silverware for the first time since 2008

'At the moment we're not even contemplating ending the year without winning any titles,' Iniesta told Spanish paper Marca. 'The squad we have has the quality to do it. 

'The important thing is to believe in what we do, in how we do it, and keep improving to reach the team's maximum potential.

'I think we have the three best forwards. There is nothing negative to say when you're talking about Leo, 'Ney' and Luis.' 

Iniesta also backed his team-mate Messi to win the Ballon d'Or ahead of Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo.

The midfielder says there is 'nothing negative' to say about the forward trio, which includes Neymar (above)

Messi and Ronaldo are in the final three alongside German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, with the Portuguese forward the favourite to take home the award for the second year in a row.

But Iniesta believes it is the Barcelona man who should me named the world's best player for the fifth time.  

'For me, Leo is my only candidate,' added Iniesta. 'Everyone has their own opinion and preference. 

'The Ballon d'Or is not governed by titles; it's based on the votes of people who feel that a player deserves it. For me, Leo is the No 1, now and always.'

Iniesta insists that Barcelona's squad is improving all the time, and will rival the Madrid clubs this year
