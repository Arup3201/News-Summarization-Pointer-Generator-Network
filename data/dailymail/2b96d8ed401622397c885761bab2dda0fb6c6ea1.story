Janet Barreto, 43, the only woman on the U.S. Marshals 15 most wanted list, has now been caught

The only woman on the U.S. Marshals' 15 most wanted list has been arrested in a shopping mall in Portland, Oregon - after more than five years on the run.

Janet Barreto, 43, was wanted in Mississippi along with her husband Ramon for the manslaughter of a child, as well as child abuse and neglect.

The couple is suspected of buying children from adoption agencies in Guatemala, before bringing them back to the U.S., physically abusing them and starving them.

One of the children died in 2008, it is alleged from the abuse, but Baretto did not turn up to her May 2009 trial and had been on the run until now. 

Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamaal Thompson told KGW.com: 'The children were purportedly often punished with beatings and on various occasions duct-taped to their beds, punched in the stomach and forced to endure having their heads submerged under water.'

The Barretos were finally caught when the U.S. Marshals were tipped of my a person in Oxford, Mississippi, who said they believed the killers were either in Oregon or Washington, and had a baby with them.

They were captured at the Jantzen Beach Center  at around 5.15pm on Tuesday, and taken to the Multnomah County Detention Center in Portland. They are awaiting extradition.

The child was taken from them and put into protective services.

The couple had been living in an apartment in Vancouver, Canada for more than a year, it is understood. 

Neighbour Randy Morrissette said: 'I thought they were a nice family that lived here peacefully. It's really weird.'
