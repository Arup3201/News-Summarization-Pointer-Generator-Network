David Cameron held back dozens of communications between himself and Rebekah Brooks from the Leveson Inquiry on legal advice, it emerged yesterday.

Downing Street confirmed that the Prime Minister did not hand over the content of texts and emails of a social nature with the former News of the World editor since they did not fall within Lord Justice Leveson’s remit.

Shadow Home Office minister Chris Bryant accused Mr Cameron of being ‘less than straightforward’ in his handling of the affair.

Correspondents: Emails between Rebekah Brooks, former Chief Executive of News International, and Prime Minister David Cameron, right, are believed to have been withheld from the Leveson Inquiry

In court: Rebekah Brooks, the former head of News International, faces charges for perverting the course of justice in relation to phone hacking

But sources close to the judge confirmed he was content with the material passed to his inquiry.

Phone hacking victim: Labour MP Chris Bryant has called for all emails to be released

A series of texts between the PM and 
Mrs Brooks were revealed to the inquiry by News International, parent 
company of the Sun and News of the World. The Leveson Inquiry only 
permitted part of one to be released to the public on the grounds that 
the others were not relevant to the terms of the inquiry.

It revealed that Mrs Brooks, who is 
now facing trial for perverting the course of justice, had told Mr 
Cameron ‘professionally we’re definitely in this together’. It has now 
emerged that Mr Cameron took advice from  government lawyers about which
of his own texts and emails should be  disclosed and failed to pass on 
those of a social nature.

The communications could have 
embarrassed the Prime Minister by exposing the full extent of his 
relations with the Murdoch empire and the extent to which he socialised 
with Mrs Brooks.

She had already claimed the pair were 
in contact twice a week and that Mr Cameron signed off messages with 
LOL, thinking it meant ‘lots of love’ rather than ‘laugh out loud’.

The emails and texts are also thought 
to include contacts between Mr Cameron and Andy Coulson, another ex-News
of the World editor.

Downing Street sources stressed that 
the Leveson Inquiry had only requested the release of communications 
between Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks that were ‘relevant’. A No 10 
spokesman said: ‘All the material the inquiry asked for was given to 
them.’

Rebekah Brooks was awarded a £7million pay-off when she resigned over the phone hacking scandal, it has emerged.

The ‘golden goodbye’ award is thought to consist of cash and pension payments as well as use of a chauffeur-driven car and an allowance for legal fees. 

Ms Brooks, who headed Australian tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s UK newspaper arm, quit in disgrace last July.  

Ms Brooks, from Churchill in Oxfordshire, is accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over allegations that she tried to conceal information from police investigating phone hacking and claims of corrupt payments to public officials at The Sun and the News of the World. 

The trial is set to take place next September.

News of the payoff also emerged on the eve of yesterday's annual general meeting of News Corp, News International’s parent group.

The award for Brooks - much higher than the £1.7m cash pay-out previously reported - is also set to rile investors. 

It is understood Ms Brooks' pay off includes a ‘claw back’ clause – which allows News International to recover some of Ms Brooks’ pay in certain circumstances.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
