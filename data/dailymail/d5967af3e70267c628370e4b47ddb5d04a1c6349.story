Drive-through zoos are popular for allowing people to get closer to animals in their natural habitat.

But one lady got a little bit closer than she would have wanted to an over-friendly buffalo with a very long tongue.

Filmed at Olympic Game Farm in Washington, the video begins with a couple of buffalo pursuing a car at a canter.

That's close enough! The buffalo pursues the car until it gets a mouthful of bread from the lady

A lady holds bread from the window as they approach and without warning one sticks its whole head into the car to take the food.

Recoiling as a large tongue winds itself out of its mouth, the squealing woman drops the bread, which is swallowed immediately, before returning to get another piece.

Spotting the bread the buffalo puts its head back through the car’s window, making the woman scream in excited panic once more.

Keeping up with the car, the buffalo winds its long tongue around the food and licks the lady as it devours it

Another lady in the car shouts: ‘Windows up guys, windows up,’ as the animal looks around for its next bite.

And after receiving its final piece of bread, the mammal extends its head even further in through the window to give the woman a great big lick.

Speaking online, the filmmaker wrote: ‘This buffalo chased and licked us while [we were] feeding him and the other deer in the park.’

Extending its head through the car window, the buffalo goes in search of more food and gives the lady a big lick

Olympic Game Farm was first opened to the public in 1972 and initially only offered guided tours.

Now a drive-through zoo, customers are allowed to feed animals including buffalo, deer, elk, bears, yak and llamas with bread.
