An Iranian scientist claims he has invented a time machine that allows you to predict the future with 98 per cent accuracy.

Ali Razeghi says his device can produce a print-out detailing any individual's life between five and eight years in advance after taking readings from the touch of a user.

He claims the Iranian government, whose nuclear programme has caused concern around the world, can use his invention to predict military conflicts and forecast the fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and oil.

Not quite the DeLorean yet: An Iranian scientist has claimed to have invented a time machine, but unlike the car (above) in Back To The Future it produces a print-out detailing a person's life ahead rather than actually taking them anywhere

He says the device is the size of a laptop and uses a complex set of algorithms which took him ten years to develop, but has not revealed any concrete details about his invention.

Unlike the time-travelling DeLorean in hit film Back To The Future, Mr Razeghi said his device 'will not take you into the future, it will bring the future to you.'

He told the Fars state news agency: 'My invention easily fits into the size of a personal computer case and can predict details of the next five to eight years of the life of its users.

'Naturally a government that can see five years into the future would be able to prepare itself for challenges that might destabilise it.

Fates of the state: Inventor Ali Razeghi claims his device can be used by warmongering Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (above) to predict military conflicts and future values of currencies and oil

'As such, we expect to market this invention among states as well as individuals once we reach a mass production stage.'

Mr
Razeghi, who claims he has 179 inventions listed under his name, has 
been criticised by friends and family for 'trying to play God.'

But he said: 'This project is not against our religious values at all.

'The Americans are trying to make this invention by spending millions of dollars on it where I have already achieved it by a fraction of the cost,' he said, without divulging how much.

He said Iran was not planning to launch the prototype just yet in case 'the Chinese will steal the idea and produce it in millions overnight'.

Doctored? Iran faced accusations that its much-heralded new fighter jet could even fly and that this picture of it soaring over mountains had been superimposed in Photoshop

Iran has been ridiculed in recent months after attempting to showcase its technological advances only to face accusations they were faked.

In February, it proudly unveiled a stealth fighter jet at a ceremony attended by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but experts quickly expressed serious doubts about whether it could even fly.

A picture of the domestically produced Qaher-313 apparently soaring over Iranian mountains did little to curb scepticism amid claims the plane never actually left the ground, but was simply doctored using Photoshop.

Critics also believe Iran's claims that it launched a monkey into space could have been faked.

Scientists in Tehran hailed the mission to send a simian 75 miles above Earth and back in a Kavoshgar rocket as a success.

But question marks were raised after the monkey presented to the nation as the heroic astronaut looked remarkably different than the one which made lift off.
