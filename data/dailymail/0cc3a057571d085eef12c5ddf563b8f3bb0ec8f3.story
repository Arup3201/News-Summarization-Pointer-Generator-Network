Leon McKenzie will realise a lifelong dream when he makes his professional boxing debut next month.

The former Norwich and Crystal Palace striker - who scored crucial goals against both Manchester clubs - will fight at London's iconic York Hall on Saturday June 29 in the super-middleweight division.

McKenzie is following in the footsteps 
of his three-time world champion uncle Duke and former British and 
European champion father Clinton.

And while he admits he will inevitably 
display traits from his famous boxing family, the 35-year-old is determined to 
stamp his own style on the sport.

'I miss scoring goals because scoring goals is a wonderful feeling,' he told Sportsmail.

'Maybe as a whole I don't miss football but I miss seeing big games and people scoring important goals.

'Football has a certain level of fitness, a little bit different to boxing but you have to be dedicated to get to the levels of the Premier League; the modern day footballers are athletes.

'I used to sneak off to the gym 
boxing wise so it was always around me. Boxing training used to give me a
little edge when I went out on the pitch.

'I'm going to have bits of my uncle and bits of my dad because they are who I've watched most but really and truly I'm replicating Leon McKenzie.

'We've been training really hard, it's always been a passion in my life and I'm overwhelmed. It's a great opportunity for me to take.'

McKenzie released his autobiography My Fight With Life - which was serialised by Sportsmail - last November.

In the book he discusses his battles with depression and admits that he attempted suicide while playing for Charlton in 2010.

'This is very serious for me, something I have always wanted to do,' he added. 'In the last five years of my life I have been tested - sometimes through my own bad choices, sometimes through circumstance.

'I am overwhelmed to be stepping into a professional boxing ring. I respect the game and respect anyone that gets into that ring. I fully believe I can do this.

'For myself and my family, we all know the road I have been on so what I am doing is an achievement in itself. I have been through so much and I canâ€™t wait to achieve this long-held dream.'
