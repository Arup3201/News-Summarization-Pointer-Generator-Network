An enormous blue diamond formerly owned by millionaire gardener and philanthropist Rachel Mellon has sold for $32.6million at auction - a new record.

The Fancy Vivid Blue diamond, mounted in platinum, weighed in at 9.75 carats, and sold for more than any other blue diamond at Sotheby's auctioneers.

An anonymous collector for Hong Kong paid the huge sum for the rock, beating off six contenders. The sale smashed expectations of around $15million.

Record-breaker: The Fancy Vivid Blue diamond, belonging to Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, pictured above, has sold for $32.6million at auction

Former owner: Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon died aged 103 this March. Above is the last known photograph of her, from January 2000 when she was 90 years old

It far exceeded the previous blue diamond record, held by the Wittelsbach Diamond, which sold in 2008 for $24.3million. The price was exceeded despite the Wittlesbach being much heavier at more than 30 carats. 

Mellon, nicknamed Bunny, died in March at 103. She was the widow of philanthropist Paul Mellon, heir to the fortune of the then-Mellon Bank, and one of the richest men in the United States.

She herself inherited a fortune derived from Listerine mouthwash, which was invented by her grandfather.

Mellon was a close confidante of political figures including Jackie Kennedy, whom she befriended while her husband John F Kennedy was a senator for Massachusetts in the 1950s.

After JFK ascended to the presidency, Mellon was invited to redesign the White House Rose Garden.

The President was so pleased with the results that, two days after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, he wrote her a note to say the area: 'has been our brightest spot in the somber surroundings of the last few days.'

She also designed a second garden after JFK died, which she insisted be named for Jackie Kennedy.

Between them, Mellon and her husband amassed a huge art collection, much of which was donated to national collections. Many of the items they kept are being sold by Sotheby's in separate lots.
