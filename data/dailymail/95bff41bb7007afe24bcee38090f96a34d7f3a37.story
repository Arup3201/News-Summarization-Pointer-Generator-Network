Two goals from Milivoje Novakovic earned Slovenia a crucial win in Lithuania to blow open the top of Group E in Euro 2016 qualifying.

The hosts had won both of their previous games but they were no match for the visitors, who were fresh from a surprise win over Switzerland last time out.

Jasmin Kurtic almost gave Slovenia an early before Lithuiania's Fiodor Cernych had a solid effort for the home team.

Novakovic then showed his clinical side by latching onto a through ball from Nejc Pecnik and finishing with ease in the 33rd minute.

He put Slovenia in complete control less than five minutes later, converting Kevin Kampl's low cross from the left.

Srecko Katanec's side were happy to sit back and soak up pressure in the second half and that's exactly what they did.

The hosts, who had the opportunity to draw level with England on nine points with a win, failed to trouble the visitors goalkeeper as Slovenia cruised to their second victory in three games.

The result leaves both teams on six points, three behind the Three Lions who narrowly beat Estonia 1-0 in Tallinn.

Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick was enough for Roy Hodgson's side, who are yet to concede a goal in qualifying.
