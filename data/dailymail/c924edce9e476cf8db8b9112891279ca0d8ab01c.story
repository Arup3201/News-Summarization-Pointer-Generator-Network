Two teenagers were left clinging on to railings for their lives as they were engulfed by huge waves crashing on to a promenade in the North East.

The pair played a game of 'chicken' while the 50ft wave slammed down on Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, as the area was lashed by severe storms.

Pictures taken in Cullercoats show the two boys refusing to run to safety as the freezing surf broke over the promenade on Tuesday evening.

Danger: Two teens risk their lives playing a game of chicken as huge waves crash onto Whitley Bay Promenade on the North East coast

Close call: The youngsters seemed oblivious as they remained on the dangerous promenade while waves crashed just metres away

High tide: The crashing waves came after sunny weather gave way to rain and heavy winds on Tuesday, causing heavy storms on the North East coast

They were then left gasping for air 
as the waves entirely engulfed them, leaving them at risk of being 
dragged into the freezing North Sea.Photographer Will Walker captured the images of the youngsters, who took their lives into their hands in the name of fun.

A
spokesman for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution has now urged 
people to think twice about playing dangerous games which leave them 
open to the power of the sea.

They said: 'The RNLI would encourage people to be aware of their own safety and consider the environment and potential dangers of wave dodging.

'The sea can be unpredictable and extremely powerful and taking part in such activities could put your life at risk.'

The incident comes a year after a teenage
girl was left fighting for her life after playing the same 'wave 
dodging' game in Eyemouth, Berwickshire.

Katie McLean, 14 and her 
13-year-old friend were dragged into the water when a 20ft wave crashed 
on top of them. They were later rescued by brave passerspy and the 
police, but only after Katie was in the water for 10 minutes.

Wipeout: Onlookers were left horrified as the tide pounded down on top of the two boys

Gone: The pair completely disappear as the ferocious tide completely covers them
