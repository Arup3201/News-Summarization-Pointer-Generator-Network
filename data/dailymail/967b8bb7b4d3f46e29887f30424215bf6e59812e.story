A 25 year-old-woman offered $100,000 life insurance to a mentally ill man to murder her husband, a court has heard.

Heather Leann Horst is accused of offering the sum to Aaron William Allen to murder her husband Brandon James Horst as he lay sleeping in bed in St Paul, Minnesota.

Prosecutors claim that Mrs Horst invented tales of domestic abuse as well as the offer of a large cash sum to convince Allen to pull the trigger.

Assistant Ramsay County Attorney Jada Lewis told the court that Mrs Horst told Allen 'I want him dead', describing the murder as a 'coldly calculated execution'.

In her opening statement to the jury, Ms Lewis said Mrs Horst stands accused of aiding and abetting first and second degree murder and conspiracy to commit first and second degree murder as a result of the killing last August. 

Allen has already admitted shooting Mr Horst telling prosecutors he had been promised a $100,000 share from her husband's two life insurance policies worth $480,000.

Ms Lewis described Mrs Horst as a 'kind of black widow' for the manner in which she had arranged her husband's murder.

Brandon Horst was shot once in the head at his home in St Paul's Minnesota on August 5, 2013

Allen said Mrs Horst had told him that she had suffered a miscarriage as a result of domestic abuse and did not want a divorce as she would lose her home, car and dogs.

Ms Lewis told the jury: 'His life was cut short by his wife's greed and selfishness.'

However, Mrs Horst's defence suggested that Allen was acting alone and was fulfilling a long term fantasy to kill someone. Deborah Ellis, defending also questioned Allen's reliability as a witness.

'He is clever. He has manipulated people, made false claims. He alone committed the murder. He is a cold-blooded murderer.'

The Pioneer Press reports that Allen, who claims to have five separate personalities, was engaged to Mr Horst's step sister.

The jury heard that the original plan was for a group of men to slit Mr Horst's throat during a staged robbery. 

Allen told the jury: 'She asked me to kill him. Directly flat out just like that. She was very persistent on me being the one to slit Brandon's throat.'

12.08am: Horst to Allen: 'On my way'

12.10am: Allen to Horst: 'Ivthink I just heard talking'

12.15am: Allen to Horst: 'He is stillvawake'

12.17am: Allen to Horst: 'And tyler* won't shut up there is a tv on upstairs'

Later Allen claims that Mrs Horst gave him a gun and told him to hide.

He said she had told him to fire several times although he admitted pulling the trigger just once. 

He has already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is facing 40 years in prison.

According to court documents, on August 5, 2013 at 1.11am Mrs Horst rang 911 and said her husband was in bed 'with lots of blood coming from his head'. She said she had no idea what happened to him.

A post mortem performed by Dr Michael McGee determined that Mr Horst was a victim of 'homicide' and suffered 'a cerebral laceration and destruction die to a gunshot wound to the head'.

According to court documents, following the murder, Mrs Horst removed the SIM card from her phone and broke it into little pieces 'so the police couldn't recover texts from it'.

According to court documents: 'Heather Horst denied being present when her husband was murdered. She denied shooting him or having someone else shoot her husband.'

Although, police were able to recover five texts from Mrs Horst's phone three days after the murder.

Mrs Horst denies all the charges.

The trial continues.
