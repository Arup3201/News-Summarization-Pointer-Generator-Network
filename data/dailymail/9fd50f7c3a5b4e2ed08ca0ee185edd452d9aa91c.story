Joseph Elone who died after collapsing in his garden may have been killed by a deadly tick bite

An honour role student who died after collapsing in his garden may have been killed by a deadly tick bite, it has been claimed.

Joseph Elone, 17, fell to the ground in his yard in Poughkeepsie, New York, just after midnight on the eve of his mother's birthday following two weeks with a minor cough, fatigue and a headache, his family said.

Doctors now believe he died of a Powassan encephalitis transmitted through a tick bite. The state is on high alert after the Health Department issued its third health advisory in four years about the deadly virus.

Joseph had popped to the shops with mother Diane to buy throat sweets before the family threw a barbecue to celebrate her 49th birthday when he collapsed on August 4.

As she went round the back to check on the food, Joseph headed for the front door. But he never made it.

His father, Benedict, who was in the family home at the time, ran to his son when he saw him lying on his back on the lawn.

'I hugged my son, I called him,' he told NBC New York. 'He couldn't even answer'

Joseph was rushed to hospital where medics 
battled to save his life but he never regained consciousness and was 
pronounced dead seven hours later.

'The whole idea … that he just dropped dead, that just blows my mind,' Mr Elon told the Poughkeepsie Journal. 'That is unfathomable.'

Joseph, an
honour roll student who wanted to become an environmental engineer and 
start a band, had been suffering from flu-like symptoms for two weeks 
but doctors seemed baffled by his illness.

It was only after his death that a post mortem revealed he had died from myocarditis and meningitis, possibly from a rare virus, Powassan encephalitis.

Dutchess County officials, citing initial testing, believe Elone may have been bitten by a tick infected with the virus, which is untreatable and can be transmitted by a bite in a matter of minutes.

According to a recent study by the journal Parasites & Vectors, six per cent of ticks in the Hudson Valley carry a variant of Powassan encephalitis, which, while relatively small compared to other diseases, is surprisingly high for one so deadly, experts say.

'There are no diagnostic tests for the disease, and no treatments that are effective,' Dr. David Roth, co-chair of the Tick-Borne Disease Alliance, told NBC New York.

Joseph did visit his doctor, complaining of his symptoms and was checked for Lyme disease and strep throat. But tests were negative.

If confirmed, Joseph would be the third person in Dutchess County to have contracted Powassan and the first to die. Statewide, he would be the 16th case and the sixth death, according to the state Department of Health

According to the Poughkeepsie Journal, Joseph was a talented guitar player and artist who harboured dreams of launching a band. He also loved hiking, camping and kayaking, his brother Emmanuel told the paper.

As a junior at Poughkeepsie High School, he was on the high honor roll and ranked 10th in the class, according to his family.

'He's a kid who knew who he was,' Mr Elone told NBC New York. 'He had all kinds of ambition. Teachers couldn't stop speaking well of him.'

'I just miss my son,' he said through tears. 'I just miss my son. I just miss my son.'
