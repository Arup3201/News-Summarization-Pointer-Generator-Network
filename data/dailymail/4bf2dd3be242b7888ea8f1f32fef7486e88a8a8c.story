The Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled that a set of white foster parents should raise two toddler sisters instead of the black grandparents who have fought for them for three years.

Steven and Liv Grosser, from Plymouth, will now raise the girls instead of Dorothy and Lawrence Dunning after the court ruled relatives should get first consideration but not preference in adoptions.

Princess and Dorothy Knox, who are now aged three and two, were placed with the Grossers after doctors found they both had traces of cocaine in their blood after they were born.

As a result of the pre-natal drug ingestion, they both suffer from developmental difficulties and the court ruled that the Grossers are better placed to provide for them.

But the Dunnings, from Gautier, Mississippi, have fought a hard battle for their granddaughters, and argue that blood relations, love and heritage should come before money.

State laws say that race should not factor in to adoptions but require that a child's 'cultural needs' should be a consideration when determining a child's best interests.

The Grossers' attorney, Wright Walling, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that there were grey areas over the word 'culture'.

'From my perspective it was never about 
race, except to the extent that their race and culture is who these 
children are,' Walling said.

'But what does culture mean? My clients 
living in the suburbs? My clients being white? Mrs. Dunning living in 
rural Mississippi? The kids living in Minnesota? Those issues have yet 
to be flushed out.'

But the Dunnings' attorney, Michael 
Perlman, countered that race was - and should have been - a factor 
during the adoption proceedings.

Separated: Dorothy Dunning said she loves her granddaughters, Princess and Dorothy (pictured), and that her ability to provide for them, as well as her blood connection to them, should come before wealth

'Even if their hearts are in the right 
place, they can't give these children the same culture, the same 
history, the same experiences that relatives can,' he told the Star Tribune.

The battle began in 2009 when Princess tested positive for cocaine and was placed with the Grossers days later. The Dunnings requested to adopt her, but the paperwork was 'stalled', the Star Tribune reported.

When Dorothy was born in 2010, 
officials asked the Grossers if they would adopt her as well, and the 
couple, who have seven other children, agreed.

Hennepin County District Judge 
Kathryn Quaintance said the girls should stay with the Grossers as they 
could better help their special needs and moving the girls from the home
could affect them.

But the Dunnings argued that they could provide a good home for the girls so no other home should have been considered.

Grief: Dorothy Dunning has uploaded videos to YouTube in which she shares her heartbreak over the battle

Difficulties: The girls were put in foster care after they were both born with traces of cocaine in their blood 

Despite her objections and a heartfelt media campaign by Dorothy Dunning to gain custody of her granddaughters, the Minnesota Court of Appeals sided with the Grossers.

The Minnesota Supreme Court heard the case in January and reached their decision on Wednesday, ruling in favour of the Grossers 5-2.

Justice Paul Anderson wrote that family members should be considered but that there is no reason not to consider other potential parents when deciding what is in the child's best interest.

But Justice Alan Page argued that the relative's petition should be considered first and others should only be looked at if they are not providing adequately for the child.

He wrote: 'I do not believe that the Legislature intended that relatives - who can meet the child's needs and offer a loving home - be passed over merely because nonrelatives may be marginally "better" in some sense, such as being more affluent or better educated than the relative.'

Decision: The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Grossers by a majority of 5-2

Dorothy Dunning had previously shared her anguish in a series of YouTube videos and in an editorial for the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder.

She wrote that she only learned her grandchildren were in care when she called the Department of Children's Services to express her concern that her son and the children's mother were on drugs.

'I wanted my babies to be in a safer environment. I then found out that my grandchildren were in the custody of foster parents,' ,' she wrote in January 2012.

'I am so appreciative of the care of 
their foster parents, but I am the biological grandmother, and I am not 
giving up my rights for the belief that they belong with me.

'Although the foster parents may have 
multiple degrees and earn more money than we do, I am a proud and hard 
worker, and so is my spouse. I've never turned to the government for any
assistance.

Thoughtful: The Grossers celebrated their win on Facebook but said their thoughts were with Dorothy

'I know that money does not give love, 
and I love my grandchildren and desire that they experience the love. This is not and never has been
about the finances... I am their grandmother and will always be their grandmother.'

But as the Dunnings struggled to come to terms with the ruling, the Grossers took to their Facebook page to celebrate their win - and to pass on their thoughts to the Dunnings.

'Justice has been done for two little girls to stay with the only family they have ever known,' Liv Grosser wrote.

'I know Dorothy is feeling sad and my heart is heavy for her... We will continue to honor her as the girls' grandma and we hope we can become friends soon. Please pray for Dorothy as she comes to grips with this decision that she can see that it is best for the girls.'
