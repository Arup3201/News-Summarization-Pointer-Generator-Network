New Yorkers will now have 24-hour access to the cupcakes that started the nationwide cupcake trend thanks to a new pink ATM that dispenses baked goods instead of cash.

Sprinkles opened its cupcake ATM on Manhattan's Upper East Side on Tuesday.

While it's the Big Apple's inaugural ATM, Sprinkles has installed the brightly colored machines in Beverly Hills, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas.
