Prostitutes have begun using the troubled apartment-sharing website, Airbnb to convert luxury Manhattan homes into temporary brothels.

The nefarious scheme allows escort agencies to use the much cheaper apartments instead of hotels for clients to meet with their girls.

One working girl, who charges up to $500 an hour has claimed that apartments can cost as little as $200 a day - and are usually rented through the internet service in the Financial District or Midtown.

Switch: This is the building in Manhattan that was turned into a brothel in late March by an escort agency

'Itâ€™s more discreet and much cheaper than The Waldorf,' said the sex worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity to the New York Post.

'Hotels have doormen and cameras. They ask questions. Apartments are usually buzz-in.'

The 21-year-old woman said that the scam is being operated by agencies - who have their girls rent the apartments through their own personal Airbnb profiles.

The apartments are paid for using debit cards and it is estimated that the agencies are saving anywhere up to $400 a day by not using hotels.

Shock: Jessica Penzari, 29, who rented out her apartment through Airbnb, March 21 through 23 was stunned to find that it had been turned into a brothel

Indeed, one apartment that was turned into a brothel belongs to Manhattan publicist Jessica Penzari, 20 - who rented hers out through Airbnb from March 21 to March 23.

'She told me that she was in the Army and needed a place to hang out before she got shipped out,' said Penzari of her Airbnb 'guest.'

'She said she was being deployed that week. She was asking for places to go out with her friends.'

However, a violent altercation between the girl who rented and a man who had paid for a massage led to the police arriving at Penzari's apartment.

When she returned, she found baby wipes and 'at least 10 condoms'.

Horrified and sickened, Penzari got Airbnb to put her up in the  InterContinental hotel in Times Square for two nights â€” with room-service meals, while they changed her locks.

They also cleaned her apartment and replaced bedsheets, comforters and pillows.

Airbnb has been hit by a swath of bad publicity recently.

Last month it was revealed that another Manhattan resident had unwittingly rented out his Chelsea apartment last month for a plus-weight orgy called XXX Freak Fest.

And in Washington DC last year, a woman reported she had rented out her apartment through Airbnb to a man who used it for male-on-male nude massage.
