The National Trust is under fire after announcing it is to open up the Big Brother house to the public.

Visitors will be able to have a look around some of the UK's most important properties during two days this month.

However, the plan to open up the Big Brother house has been criticised by former MP Ann Widdecombe who said she was 'saddened' by the move.

The former politician believes the Trust should concentrate on properties which had 'stood the test of time'.

Brush with fame: The Big Brother House will be open to visitors thanks to the National Trust

The National Trust admitted the scheme to open the house up was just a bit of light-hearted fun

The property with its ever-changing decor has been home to figures such as Vinnie Jones, Ivana Trump and Alex Reid who have taken part in Celebrity Big Brother over the years.

It is currently being used for the latest series which is due to end later this week.

The property, housed on a plot at the Elstree TV studios, has been seen by millions during the many series on Channel 4 and more lately on Channel 5. It will open to the public on September 27 and 28.

The National Trust’s London director Ivo Dawnay said: 'The fact that the housemates’ residence is not, say, a sublime late Robert Adam country house does not necessarily make it less interesting.

The house has undergone many changes during its 13-year history

'The great houses of our past reflected the tastes of the day and so does the Big Brother House.'

He added: 'Our tongues are not a million miles from our cheeks - unusual for an organisation not most famous for its sense of humour. We hope that by opening the Big Brother house we are paving the way to an altogether wittier future.'

But Miss Widdecombe - a former contestant on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing - told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I’m rather saddened by this.

'I’m a member of the National Trust and I’m not going to be burning my membership card because of this, but I don’t think it’s part of the National Trust’s mission.'

Miss Widdecombe said she accepted that the Trust should update its portfolio and not 'just wholly go for historic homes', but questioned whether it should be getting involved with the Big Brother house, rather than BBC Television Centre, which is due for redevelopment.

'I do think something has to stand the test of time before you can seriously call it heritage,' she said.

'I don’t think it needs to be tawdry and celebrity-obsessed. There’s lots of candidates around that I think you could choose for this sort of exercise.'

The move would do the Trust 'no favours' she said and warned: 'Even Prime Ministers have discovered in their time that trying to make things look more trendy can upset people who are pretty loyal.'
