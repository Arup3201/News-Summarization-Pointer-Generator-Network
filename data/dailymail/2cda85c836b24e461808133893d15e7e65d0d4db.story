The stepfather of a woman held by police for three days over the shooting of two burglars said last night: 'I'd have blown their bloody heads off.'

John Towell said Tracey Ferrie and her husband Andy who was also arrested had faced a gang of four men at their isolated cottage in the early hours.

He said: 'Four of them came in. Andy and Tracey did what anyone would have done.' He said the law must now be changed to protect property owners who act to defend their land when it is burgled.

'Shoot their legs? I'd have blown their bloody heads off,' he declared.

It comes as one of the group, Daniel Mansell, 33, from Leicester, pleaded guilty at Loughborough Magistrates' Court today  to the burglary at the farmhouse in the early hours on Sunday.

Held in isolation: 'Hard-working' Andy and Tracey Ferrie, from Leicestershire, were held by police for three days over the shooting of two burglars

He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on September 25.

Joshua O'Gorman, 27, who is also charged with burglary, gave no indication of plea and was remanded in custody to appear before magistrates on September 14.

Mr and Mrs Ferrie were arrested after dialling 999 to tell police they had shot at a gang trying to break in to their 200-year-old cottage near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

Mr Ferrie, 35, told police he grabbed the gun and fired it, hitting two of the men and forcing the others to flee. Four men were arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary on suspicion of aggravated burglary.

Last night police said Mr and Mrs Ferrie had been released on bail 'pending further inquiries'. But supporters of the ‘hard- working’ couple told of their outrage at their arrest on suspicion of causing grievous  bodily harm.

Mr Ferrie's aunt Kathleen Merry said her nephew, who runs a caravan repair business, would have acted to protect his home and wife. Mrs Merry, from Leicester, said: 'What was Andy supposed to have done, wait to see if the men attacked him or Tracey, or worse?'

It is thought Mrs Ferrie, 43, a country sports enthusiast and former model, held the licence for the shotgun used to fire at the alleged intruders.

Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie

Last night her mother Hazel, 63, who is married to Mr Towell, said her daughter was a keen clay pigeon shooter and confirmed she owned a gun.

Mrs Towell said her daughter called from the police station, where she was  being held in isolation from her husband, on Monday.

She said: 'I was so relieved to talk 
to her. She phoned, saying: ''Don't worry about me''. They've had 
break-ins before over there. It's remote. It must have been planned.'

Mr and Mrs Ferrie's MP, Tory Alan 
Duncan, has spoken out in their support and described them as 'victims' 
who should be free to defend their property.

A Facebook group set up to support them had attracted more than 3,200 supporters by yesterday evening.

Kathleen Merry said that even if the 
couple were ultimately released without charge, their arrests could 
impact on their plans to emigrate to Australia next year. 'Andy's life 
could be ruined because a gang tried to burgle him,' she said. 'It's all
 wrong.'

Mr Ferrie, a keen musician, sang as 
half of a guitar duo called Useless Wooden Toys who were at one time a 
regular on the pub circuit in and around his home town of Melton 
Mowbray. A friend of the couple said they met in a village pub when Mrs 
Ferrie turned up to watch him perform.

At the time she was estranged from her first husband. The Ferries married two years ago after a short courtship.

A friend of the Ferries, who asked not
 to be named, recalled how the couple 'ran away to a register office' to
 tie the knot without telling their friends.

She added: 'They are a hard-working 
but private couple who do not deserve what has happened to them. Andy 
isn't a violent person – he doesn't like guns or killing animals and 
isn't into country sports, although Tracey grew up in the country and is
 a keen shooter.'

She said Mrs Ferrie, a saleswoman, was a 'glamorous, bubbly woman'.

Last night Leicestershire Police said 
two men aged 27 and 33, both from Leicester, had been charged with 
burglary.

They were remanded in custody to appear at Loughborough 
magistrates' court today. Two other men, aged 31 and 33, arrested on 
suspicion of aggravated burglary, have been bailed pending further 
inquiries.

The case has reignited the debate 
about the rights of householders to defend themselves and their homes 
from intruders and comes as the Government prepares to introduce 
legislation this autumn to clarify the law on the issue.

The debate 
first rose to prominence in 1999 when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin shot 
dead 16-year-old Fred Barras at his remote home.

Barras and accomplice Brendon Fearon 
had disturbed Martin in the middle of the night.

The farmer was jailed 
for life at Norwich Crown Court in April 2000 for murder, but his 
sentence was reduced by the Appeal Court to five years for manslaughter 
and he was released in 2003.

Fearon, who was wounded in the leg, was jailed for three years for conspiracy to burgle.

* A Second World War veteran was being hailed a hero in America yesterday after he shot dead a burglar who broke into his home with two other men.

Earl Jones, 92, wasn't arrested and is unlikely to be charged in Kentucky after shooting the raider dead with a single rifle bullet to the heart.

'These people aren't worth any more to me than a groundhog,' the pensioner said after the shooting in the early hours of Monday. Mr Jones claimed he was perfectly within his rights to defend his life and his home on a 500-acre farm.

Kentucky, like at least 24 other states in the US, has a 'castle' doctrine enshrined in its laws which gives residents the right to protect their homes with deadly force if necessary to prevent criminal trespass, robbery or burglary.
