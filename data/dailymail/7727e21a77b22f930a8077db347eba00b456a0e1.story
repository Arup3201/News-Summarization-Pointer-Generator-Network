The days of kids with missing teeth looking under their pillows to find a shiny quarter from the Tooth Fairy are over, nowadays the winged, dust-wielding fairy is shelling out the big bucks, a recent survey says.

A recent survey by oral-healthcare company Sunstar Gum found that parents across the country are digging deeper into their pockets when their little ones lose a tooth.

However, the amount varies across the country with kids in New York city raking in $13.25 for every molar, bicuspid, or incisor, according to Yahoo Parenting.

'This is New York City,' one mother of three told the New York Daily News. 'So in other parts of the country, people give $2 or $5, but here, it's double and even triple that.'

The company questioned 1,000 families earlier this month, focusing on five cities: New York City, NY; Los Angeles, CA.; Boston, MA, Chicago, IL. and Dallas/Houston, TX. 

The survey found that, in Los Angeles,  kid's teeth go for, on average, $9.69, Chicago ($5.85), Dallas/Houston ($5.28), and Boston ($5.02).

While Los Angeles and New York parents may give seemingly large amounts, Yahoo Parenting found that most parents across the country give their children between $1 and $5 when playing the Tooth Fairy.

New York, NY: $13.25

Los Angeles, Ca: $9.69

Chicago, IL: $5.85

Dallas/Houston, TX: $5.28

Boston, MA: $5.02

In fact, some of Yahoo Parenting's respondents were outraged by the city folk's excessive payments.

During an informal Facebook survey on the matter, parents around the country recalled their own days as gap-toothed children, receiving quarters from the Tooth Fairy.

A Colorado mom wrote: '$13??? $13!!! Not here!! We leave $5 and I cringe at that.'

Though some may cringe at the tooth fairy's lavish payouts, experts at Delta Dental Plans Association say her generosity has increased since 2013.

Delta Dental's most recent 'The Original Tooth Fairy Poll' found that the Tooth Fairy left $225 million under kid's pillows nationwide last year, according to CNBC.

In 2014, parents paid an average of $4.36 for each lost tooth, up 25 percent from 2013, when the average was $3.50.

Delta Dental reports that 81 percent of U.S. parents played the Tooth Fairy in 2014, exchanging money for a tooth as their children slept and only 17 percent reported that their children weren't happy with their gift. 

The study also concluded the average tooth price by U.S. region: Midwest, $2.83; Northeast, $4.16; West, $4.68 and $5.16 in the South.
