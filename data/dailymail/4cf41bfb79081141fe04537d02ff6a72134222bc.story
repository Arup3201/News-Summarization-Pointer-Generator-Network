Once the pride of Britain's railways, the iconic A4 Class steam engine is now rarely seen.

But the locomotive has returned to the tracks and was pictured yesterday trundling along over the historic 43 arches of the Yarm Viaduct in Stockton-on-Tees on its way to the North Yorkshire Moors railway.

It has been a busy year for the 4464 Bittern which has recently been on display in Shildon, County Durham, along with its five siblings reunited for one final time.

The gleaming steam train is one of 35 A4 locomotives designed by Sir Nigel Gresley in the 1930s - which were the fastest ever built at the time - but only six now remain.

Two made their way across the Atlantic from Canada and America for the reunion at the National Railway Museum earlier this year.

The Bittern is now on its way to the North Yorkshire Railway where she will take part in this year's Steam Gala Weekend.

She was photographed crossing the beautiful bridge as she travelled from Crewe, Cheshire, up to Grosmount in North Yorkshire.

Built for speed: The 4464 Bittern can speed along the tracks consistently at 90 - 100mph, 25mph faster than its predecessors

Reunited: The 4464 Bittern pictured with its surviving siblings - including the Mallard (pictured far right) which remains the fastest steam train in the world

The train,
 sister to the fastest steam locomotive in the world, will spend the 
weekend thundering through the countryside on a magnificent heritage 
route.

The
 North Yorkshire Moors railway was brought back to life more than four 
decades ago after being among 5,000 miles of track and 2,300 stations 
closed by Dr Richard Beeching in 1963. It is now the busiest heritage 
route in the UK.

These pictures show the Bittern passing St. John Baptist Church over the Yarm Viaduct high above the River Tees.

Bittern's sister the Mallard is the fastest steam train in the world and reached the speed of 125.88mph in 1938.

World beater: The Mallard pictured in 1938 as it was about to start its record-breaking run along the East Coast Mainline when it hit 126mph

Success: The team from Mallard celebrate their record run near Peterborough 75 years ago. The challenge was so intense it left the loco in need of repair
