A rescue dog with droopy skin was given a £1,000 facelift to stop him from completely losing his sight.

Rock, a two-year-old dog, was left in difficulty after his folds of skin meant his eyelids and forehead had began to curl into his eyes, leaving him in danger of going blind. 

Staff at Woodside Sanctuary in Plympton in Devon decided the only option was to operate on Rock, giving him a partial facelift and restructuring his eyes. 

Rock the bloodhound was given a £1,000 partial facelift and eye restructure after his droopy skin condition was causing his forehead and eyelids to fold into his eyes and leaving him at risk of going completely blind

The animal is now recovering and has found new owners who will adopt him once he is fit enough to be released. 

Helen Lecointe, manager at Woodside Sanctuary in Plympton, Devon, said Rock was already suffering from the condition - known as entropion -  when he was brought to the home.

She said: 'We immediately saw that he was suffering from a nasty condition.

'Anyone who's had a lash in their eye will be sure to understand how painful this must have been 24/7.

'Rock is a lovely boy and, although he's feeling rather sorry for himself right now, his future wellbeing has been massively improved.

'We're extremely grateful to all the donors who enabled this to happen so quickly.'

Following surgery Rock had to wear a collar to stop him scratching his face, and is now recovering 

Animal lovers donated £1,000 to the sanctuary to fund the necessary surgery. 

John Hicks and his family fell in love with Rock while looking for a companion for their deerhound, Sage.

Mr Hicks, 45, of Saltash, Cornwall, said: 'We've already got three cats and two dogs and wanted another big dog as a companion for our deerhound.

'We looked at three dogs beforehand at Woodside and the ones that got on with us and our dog didn't get on with cats whereas Rock gets on with everyone and everything.

'He is really friendly and, although he's got a presence, he is a big softy.'

The number of operations to remove excess dog skin has increased by more than 80 per cent in four years.

Criticisms have been raised about the over-breeding of pedigree dogs following a BBC documentary in 2008 that exposed health problems among some of the most extreme cases.

After the documentary experts called for breeds of dogs which displayed health problems, such as entropion, to be dropped from the show but the Kennel Club did not comply with the demand. 

In 2012 tests were launched at Crufts to check for conditions like this to ensure these breeds were not rewarded and to discourage breeding them for the characteristics that can cause them such discomfort.

Ms Lecointe said: 'Like many wrinkle faced pedigrees, Rock is the result of ill-considered genetic breeding and the folds in his face were making his problem even worse.'

Dawn Cornish, deputy manager of the sanctuary, said: 'Whilst Bloodhounds are highly prone to this condition, in Rock's case it was more severe and it was vital that he received this operation.'

Dr Gert ter Haar, of the Royal Veterinary College, said the number of procedures had risen rapidly in the last few years.

He said: 'We do not undertake these operations unless there is a medical reason to do so.

'We find some of them have excessive skin folds which can cause severe infections. It can cause blindness and if the folds cover the nose they cannot breath.'
