An elderly couple were tied, gagged and tortured during a burglary at their home by a gang wearing white boiler suits and balaclavas.

Four thugs tormented their victims, who are in their 70s, after bursting into their home in Coton, Cambridgeshire, last November.

The gang used a sledgehammer to break down the door and a crow bar to force their way into the property.

They then bound the couple together with gaffer tape and repeatedly pricked the male victim with a pin brooch while demanding cash.

The woman suffered a broken toe after being hit by a hammer and also sustained a black eye during the four hour ordeal.

The gang fled with several valuable items including a pair of jade storks, a solid silver Aztec artefact and antique stone chickens and left the couple locked inside their home.

Cambridgeshire Police have now confirmed that two men aged 28 and 34 were arrested last Friday in connection with the attack.

It follows the arrests earlier this year of three men aged 33, 35 and 42 from Peterborough, Merton in London and Cambridge.

Detective Inspector Alan Page said: 'This elderly couple were put through a terrifying ordeal by four armed men.

'It was a cowardly and calculated attack that left its victims in fear for their lives.

'This robbery was one of the most horrendous offences I have investigated in 20 years of policing.'

'I urge anyone with information to get in contact. People like this do not deserve your protection or loyalty.'

All five men who were arrested have now been released on police bail.

A £5,000 reward has also been offered to catch the culprits.
