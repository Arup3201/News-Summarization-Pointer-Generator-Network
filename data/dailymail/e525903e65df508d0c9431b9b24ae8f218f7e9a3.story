For many couples languishing in a moribund long-term relationship, the idea of a few tense hours on a claustrophobic road trip might prove the final straw.

Yet Jayne Wilkinson, 56, and David Turner, 54, put their 12-year union on the line by popping out for a drive that spanned five years, 136,000 miles and 66 countries.

And the couple say the adventure brought them closer together despite brushes with malaria, snakebites, gun-toting officials, and the biggest threat to their trip – David's inability to put the lid back on the toothpaste.

Jayne said: 'Most people assume we must have been a really close couple to start this journey but that's wrong. I suspect we may have separated had it not been for the trip.

'The pressures of work were becoming harder, we spent little time together and we didn't even have that much in common. But now we know what we have in common and that is travelling. That is our glue.'

The Birmingham couple first came up with the idea in 2008 after becoming bored with their 9-to-5 lives. David, then a legal rep, and Jayne, a former call centre worker, spent a year planning the trip, buying a Land Rover Defender, which they christened Lizzybus in honour of The Queen.

They left Dover on August 16, 2009, with a tent, a small fridge and a £50-a-day budget – and have only just returned.

After driving down through Europe, the couple travelled around the edge of Africa, where they encountered one pistol-toting border guard who demanded £125. They haggled and he settled for £1.30 and a can of beer.

Jayne said: 'I fell ill in the Democratic Republic of Congo. David had a book called When There Is No Doctor and he realised that I had malaria. We had been taking anti-malaria pills but for three days I was delirious. Eventually I recovered.'

But the biggest threat to their trip came from a more domestic source.

Jayne said: 'David kept leaving the toothpaste lid off and it was making a mess. When you are living out of the back of car everything becomes magnified and it can drive you insane. We had a huge barney which ended up with us vowing to end it all and ship Lizzybus home as we couldn't bear to sit next to each other for another minute. We wanted to talk to someone about the row but only had each other.'

Ends of the earth: Crossing through the Arctic Circle in Alaska in their Land Rover Defender, which they christened Lizzybus

Relations were eventually fixed and they moved on, through Syria, Turkey, Iran, India, South-East Asia and on to Australia where Jayne had another misfortune: 'In the bush and felt a knock on my foot – and saw a snake. An hour later my foot started to swell and I saw fang marks. I panicked, but as I felt fine I concluded it must have been non-venomous.

'When I told locals they said it was a deadly Eastern Brown snake, and it must have just attacked something else, so when it bit me there was no venom left – a lucky escape.'

The couple crossed to South America then made their way up to America, Alaska and Canada before their return. Jayne said: 'We've had the most incredible adventure, terrifying at times, but amazing. We are just ordinary people who gave up jobs, houses and nice lives to live 2ft away from each other 24 hours a day.

'I think most would see that as a nightmare rather than a dream and it did feel like that to start with but we had told everyone we were going around the world, so it would have been embarrassing to come home.'

And the trip has not satisfied their wanderlust – in the new year they plan to hit the road again, heading for Japan and Russia.

They travelled 136,000 miles through 66 countries on a £50-per-day budget and have only recently returned
