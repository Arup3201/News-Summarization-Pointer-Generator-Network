With more than 100 years experience between them, there's little that former prostitutes Louise and Martine Fokkens, both 71, don't know about men.

Now the pair, who retired last year, have revealed the secrets of keeping your man happy - both in bed and out - in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'What I've learned about men is that 
when they [men] drink, it's not good,' chirps mother-of-four Louise. 'I have also learned that people need prostitutes - it is normal and we should respect it.

'Men are born this way [in need of sex]. There
 isn't a problem and it makes me mad when people don't have respect for 
what we do.'

Between them, the Fokkens twins have slept with 355,000 men during careers that began more than half a century ago.

The sisters, who are famous for their trademark matching red clothes, first turned to prostitution aged 20 after escaping violent relationships.

'We were young and we made jokes and had
 respect for men,' says Louise of the twins' lasting success in the sex trade.

Essential: Louise says the secret of success in bed is sussing out what your man wants - and giving it to him

Busy: Since giving up their jobs as prostitutes, the pair have opened a pop up shop and will appear on TV

BE EASY GOING

'Be easy, listen to what he wants - always.'

FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS - AND GIVE IT TO HIM

'Every man wants something different and that's the real game, finding out what they want.'

DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON INTIMACY

'Lots of men who visit prostitutes do it because their wives won't have sex with them even though they love them.'

BE TRUE TO YOURSELF

'Always be yourself. This is what we learnt when we were little and it's true.'

'We had the whole package. Then when my sister joined 
me - we were in one room together - we were very popular.

'There weren't 
live shows back then but we used to do our own - we did a dance.'

Despite their plans to move on after a few years in the game, the duo swiftly became an Amsterdam institution and are still red light district regulars - even if they aren't seeing clients anymore.

'I am not missing work,' says Louise, a year after her retirement. 'Most weeks I am at my pop up shop in the centre of Amsterdam where we are selling our two books.

'We also do a little painting. Because of the red light district we have a lot of contacts so we have a lot of visitors to the shop.'

She adds: 'We have to keep busy because we have no pension, as most people our age do. We still do see a few of our old clients, we meet them for either a tea or a coffee... or at the bar.'

The pair will also appear on new FOX documentary, Outsiders With Darren McMullen, which shows them giggling flirtatiously as they give the British presenter a tour of the red light district.

Busy though they are, Louise has still found time to share her thoughts on what it really takes to make a man happy.

'Be easy, listen to what he wants - always,' she suggests. 'When we started in the 1960s, we learned the same thing from the older women we worked with.

'Every man wants something different and that's the real game - finding out what they want.'

What about men who cheat on their wives with prostitutes or other women? 'They want to be free,' she explains. 'Their wives won't have sex with them even if they love them.'

Warming to her theme, she continues: 'If you really want to meet a man and keep him, you need to be yourself.

'Always be yourself. This is what we learned when we were little and it's true. But also you must have respect for other people and listen to other people.'
