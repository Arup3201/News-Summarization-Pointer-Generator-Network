Nico Rosberg has been fined a six-figure sum for his crash with Lewis Hamilton at last weekend’s Belgian Grand Prix.

Mercedes, keen to show they have a grip of the fractious situation, called both drivers to the team’s factory in Brackley on Friday to discuss the second-lap incident that later forced Hamilton to retire from the race.

The pair met in the boardroom for two hours with Toto Wolff, Mercedes motorsport’s executive director, and Paddy Lowe, the technical director.

Coming together: Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton crashed at last weekend's Belgian Grand Prix 

Flashpoint: The two title rivals collided for the first time this season at round 13 of the world championship

Afterwards Mercedes issued a statement, saying: ‘During this meeting, Nico acknowledged his responsibility for the contact and apologised for this error of judgment.

‘Suitable disciplinary measures have been taken.

‘Lewis and Nico understand and accept the team’s No 1 rule: there must be no contact between the team’s cars on track.

‘It has been made clear that another such incident will not be tolerated. But Nico and Lewis are our drivers and we believe in them. They remain free to race.’

Although Mercedes’ idea of transparency did not extend to revealing the nature of the ‘disciplinary measures’, Sportsmail understands Rosberg’s fine will go to charity. Both men issued statements after the meeting.

Reflecting on the incident, when the drivers collided as Rosberg attempted to overtake at the Les Combes chicane, the German offered an apology to his British team-mate.

5. Valtteri Bottas (Williams) - 110 

Rosberg, who leads Hamilton by 29 points at the top of the drivers’ world championship standings, said: ‘The No 1 rule for us as team-mates is that we must not collide — but that is exactly what happened.

‘For that error of judgment, I apologise to Lewis and the team.

‘I also want to say sorry to the fans who were deprived of our battle in Belgium.

‘Lewis and I have been given clear instructions about how we race each other. ‘As drivers, we have a clear responsibility to the team, the fans of the sport, our partners and Mercedes-Benz to deliver clean racing.

‘We take that responsibility very seriously. I look forward to concluding the season with hard, fair competition on and off track right up to the final lap of the season in Abu Dhabi.’ 

Sorry: Hamilton said he and Nico had 'both made mistakes' in his statement issued on Friday afternoon 

Hamilton, who had revealed details of an internal team meeting held soon after the race, escaped without punishment for that particular indiscretion but he admitted: ‘Nico and I accept that we have both made mistakes and I feel it would be wrong to point fingers and say which one is worse than the other.

‘What’s important is how we rise as a team from these situations.

‘We win and we lose together and, as a team, we will emerge stronger.

‘There is a deep foundation that still exists for me and Nico to work from, in spite of our difficult times and differences.

‘It’s going to be a tough road from here but championships have been won from much further back than I am now.’
