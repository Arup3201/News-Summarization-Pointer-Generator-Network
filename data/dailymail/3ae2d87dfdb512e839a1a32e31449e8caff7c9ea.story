We all know the Premier League’s definition of a ‘homegrown’ player is rather loose — players of any nationality are homegrown as long they have been at any English club for three years before their 21st birthday. 

Cesc Fabregas at Chelsea, Danny Welbeck at Arsenal and Frank Lampard at Manchester City count as homegrown for their new clubs. But what about truly homegrown players? 

This weekend in the Premier League only nine clubs fielded players in their starting XI who qualify for a home nations country and were developed by their club. 

English forward Gabby Agbonlahor grabbed Aston Villa's winner against Liverpool at Anfield on the weekend

Tyler Blackett has started all four of Manchester United's league matches so far this season

Wilfried Zaha progressed through Crystal Palace's academy before joining Manchester United 

John Terry has remained at Chelsea despite the club's influx of foreign stars in recent years

Manchester United, Aston Villa, Leicester and West Ham were the only club to start with more than one.

Louis van Gaal named Jonny Evans and Tyler Blackett in his side which comfortably defeated Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. 

Mark Noble and James Tomkins both started for West Ham in their 2-2 draw a Hull City, Andy King and Liam Moore started for  Leicester City while Aston Villa match winner Gabby Agbonlahor was one of two homegrown players to start for Paul Lambert's side at Anfield.

Manuel Pellegrini did not name one Manchester City academy graduate in his side which started at Arsenal
