A jobless graduate is channeling fictitious comedy boss David Brent in an attempt to get hired. 

Dressed in a smart shirt, suit and tie, 21-year-old Will Bower recorded a video of himself as the smarmy Ricky Gervais character and uploaded the clip to his website recruitwill.com. 

The charismatic young man, who finished his Business and Management Studies degree at the University of Sussex, has been unable to secure work, despite graduating with a 2:1. 

Looking for a job: Will Bower made the hilarious video as a way to stand out from the crowd 

The desperate graduate from Crawley, West Sussex, has now turned to the paper merchant boss from The Office in a bid to get work.

The video features him answering a number of questions from a pretend interviewer in which he explains his qualities and experiences.

He talks about his time on BBC radio, meeting with the speaker of the House of Commons and passing his driving theory test first time - all in the style of David Brent.

In the video, speaking using his hand to portray other people asking him questions, he said: 'Why am I not employed? Good question.

'People say 'Oh, Will. Will, you're so successful already, aren't you?'

'Well yeah, cheers.

'(They say) 'Will, you've been on BBC radio recently to talk about your videos, right?' Yeah, I have.

'(They say) 'Will, you passed your driving theory test first time, right?' Yeah.'

''Why are you not employed then?' The truth is, I've been waiting. Playing it hard to get, as they say.

'Tip - let the companies come to you. Don't go to the job, don't go to the job. Naturally, gravitate, synergy. 

Mr Bower added he has been 'loving life' and 'chillaxing' while he has been unemployed.

'But now the game is up, I've given in,' he goes on to say.

'I've made this video for the people and the places that I want to work for.

'So if you're a marketing or a HR manager and you work at a marketing firm, then I'm interested.

'Send me over the thing, I'll sign it and I'll see you Monday.

'Work is a way of life for me - it's a religion. Christians, they pilgrimage to Lourdes, Muslims to Mecca, but me? To your desk. To my desk, in your building.

'I want to work for you. See you Monday, cheers.'

Mr Bower has been applying to various marketing companies in London but wanted to find a way to 'stand out from the crowd'.

Speaking after making the video, he said: 'I have been applying to marketing companies in London and they must get hundreds of applications to look through.

'I tried to think of a way to stand out from the crowd so I made the video.

'I find it difficult to brag about myself and big myself up so I thought I would do it as David Brent.

'After all, if in doubt go to the man who does it best.'

Having already received a number of encouraging comments, he is now waiting to see if he gets any job offers or interviews.
