A New Mexico woman is being tested for Ebola after returning from Sierra Leone with symptoms similar to those displayed by victims of the virus.

However, health officials say that the 30-year-old teacher is unlikely to have the untreatable disease.

Although she has a fever, muscle aches, headaches and a sore throat, the woman has had no known exposure to the virus, which can only be passed on through bodily fluids, and not through the air or water.

She is being tested by the Department of Health and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the University of New Mexico Hospital 'out of an abundance of caution', health officials say.

Despite the unlikelihood that the woman has Ebola, those treating her are still wearing protective clothing, while visitors are also limited.

Dr Meghan Brett, the UNMH epidemiologist. told the Albuquerque Journal: 'Returning from overseas with a fever could be a lot of things. It could be routine.'

And Dr Robert Bailey, associate dean for clinical affairs at hospital’s School of Medicine, told the Santa Fe New Mexican: 'There really isn’t a risk to the public at this point. The risk of Ebola is not having the patient in the hospital - being in a situation like the folks in Africa are experiencing right now with folks getting sick in rural villages and nobody recognizes it.'

Blood samples should show by Wednesday or Thursday whether the woman has the virus or not. 

While Ebola has claimed more than 1,100 lives in west Africa, the only confirmed cases of the virus in the U.S. are two health care workers who picked it up in Liberia.

The pair, a man and a woman, are being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, and are showing signs of recovery.

Nancy Writebol, 59, and Dr Kent Brantley, 33, have been undergoing experimental treatment, as doctors look to find a cure.

They were the first two people to be given experimental drug ZMapp, which doctors hope will help them fight the virus with a 90 per cent fatality rate. 

While Dr Brantly was able to walk into the hospital, Ms Writebol was in worse condition when she arrived last week but she was still able to recognize her son when she saw him for the first time.

'There was a little crease of a smile that came up and we were both in tears,' Jeremy Writebol recalled on the Today show. 'I was able just to say, "Mom I love you".'

President of SIM, the Christian organisation Ms Writebol works for, said: 'This could possibly be an opportunity for Emory Hospital to help understand what’s going on and find a cure. That would be incredible,' the Los Angeles Times reported.

Ebola symptoms normally show up between two and 21 days of coming into contact with the disease. The New Mexico teacher returned to the U.S. on August 4 and begun displaying symptoms of illness of August 15.

So far, there have been more than 2,100 confirmed and suspected cases of the disease.

It has claimed the lives of at least 1,145 people from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, as well as that of a Spanish priest last week.

Patients were forced to flee an isolation ward in Liberia yesterday after an armed attack on an isolation ward.

Some of the 29 quarantined people have now been brought to another hospital after being chased from where they were staying in Monrovia, while others remain loose.

The National Institutes of Health say Ebola victims usually die of shock.
