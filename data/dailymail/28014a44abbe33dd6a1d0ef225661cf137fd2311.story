Whatever life serves him, Boris Johnson is seldom stuck for a colourful turn of phrase.

Faced with a dish of camel on a trade mission to the Gulf, however, he showed that being Mayor of London does not mean he can’t act like every other tourist too - by reaching for his smartphone to take a photo of the local delicacy.

Mr Johnson was confronted with the exotic meal, piled high on a large salver, yesterday when he met with the UAE’s Minister of Culture and Youth Sheikh Nahyan Mubarak Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi.

An on-looker said: ‘Boris was sitting at the head of the table. When he saw the magnificent spread he said, I’ve got to take a picture of this, and got up to take a snap.’

The smiling Sheikh leaned in towards the impressive platter as Mr Johnson clicked away using the camera on his iPhone. London’s Mayor then sat down again - and tucked in.

Camel is said to taste like ‘coarse beef’ and can be tough and chewy. But sources said he ‘enjoyed’ the meal.

An aide of Mr Johnson’s said: ‘They 
discussed their mutual business and cultural interests. Sheikh Al Nahyan
then kindly put on a local traditional feast for the delegation.

‘There were lots of traditional meat 
and salad dishes, including camel.

'The Mayor sampled all of them. 
Everyone enjoyed the meal.’

Mr Johnson’s reaction was somewhat 
more enthusiastic than that of the Prince Wales when he was treated to a
whole skinned and roasted baby camel by the Crown Prince of Saudi 
Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz, last month.

Short stop: Boris Johnson will take a break during the trip to fly back to London for Lady Thatcher's funeral before finishing the Qatari leg of the five-day tour

Charles, who was on a tour of the Middle East on behalf of the British government, brought a couple of morsels to his lips with a gracious smile, before cleverly pushing his food round his plate for the rest of the hour-long banquet.

Mr Johnson is on a five-day trip, but will break off to return to London for Baroness Thatcher’s funeral.

He will then return to the Gulf on Thursday for the Qatari leg of the trade mission.
