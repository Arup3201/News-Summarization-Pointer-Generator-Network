A man shoveling snow in a Chicago suburb Monday evening made a disturbing discovery when he came upon his neighbor’s body, which he initially mistook for a garbage bag.

Police say 55-year-old Elizabeth Lutz was found lying face down, buried under snow covering a parkway in the city of Nile.

An officer called to the scene administered CPR, but failed to get a response from the woman.

Grisly find: A man shoveling snow outside his mother-in-law's home came upon Lutz's body in the snow after initially mistaking it for a garbage bag 

Lutz was taken to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, where she was pronounced dead.

Authorities say there were no visible signs of injury on the body to suggest foul play.

They added the woman was dressed in a winter coat, hat and boots at the time of her death.

The Cook County medical examiner's office reports a Tuesday autopsy was inconclusive, pending the results of additional tests.

Lutz's friend, local florist Pamela Swanson, told NBC Chicago the 55-year-old mother of three had been fearlessly battling breast cancer since 2006 and had undergone several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Despite her poor health, Lutz worked part time at Swanson’s shop and volunteered at a local nursing home whenever she could.

Ms Lutz lived with her boyfriend of eight years, Rick Nordskog, on Dobson Street in Niles.

The woman’s neighbor Annie Hall says Nordskog was home Monday night but did not know that his girlfriend was lying dead in the snow just steps away.

The man who made the gruesome discovery told police he arrived at his mother-in-law's home in the 6800 block of Dobson to shovel her driveway at around 5.15pm.

He noticed at once something dark peeking through the snow in the parkway, but took it to be a discarded trash bag.

Lutz had undergone several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment and was in remission

Lutz had just returned from vacation with her boyfriend and three adult children

It was not until about 40 minutes later that he approached the mystery object and discovered that it was a human corpse.

Swanson said her late friend had been in remission and had just returned from vacation with her boyfriend and three adult children.
