British companies are actively recruiting Romanians to come and work as midwives, waiters and hotel workers in the UK.

Ahead of Britain opening its borders in January, weekly jobs fairs are being held in the capital Bucharest.

And dozens of recruitment websites are advertising low-skilled jobs in this country – some offering the promise of ‘cash daily’ and others claiming knowledge of English is ‘not necessary’.

Under the EU's freedom of movement laws, all 29million citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, which joined in 2007, will gain unrestricted rights to live and work in Britain

Romanian recruiters said they believed young people in the UK 'didn't want' the blue-collar jobs

The roles vary from minimum wage bartending to a £34,000-a-year job as an NHS midwife – which comes with a ‘relocation package’, raising questions over the costs of such  overseas recruitment.

One advert reads: ‘Britain will remove restrictions on the labour market from 2014! Do not miss the start!’

Another boasts of the joys of working in the ‘historic, multicultural and glorious United Kingdom’, advising Romanians that they would ‘join hundreds of fellow Eastern Europeans’ already working there.

Critics have warned such a large influx of Romanian workers will put huge pressure on public services, and make it harder for British people to get jobs.

According to recruitment website Tjobs, 59,377 UK jobs have been advertised through them this  year and 60,828 candidates have responded

A recent study by the IRES, the Romanian Institute for Migration and Strategy, found the UK was the most-sought after destination to work among young Romanians

Recruitment agencies claim they have already found staff for dozens of UK-based hotel groups including Marriott, Hilton, De Vere and the Pride of Britain consortium, as well as fast-food chains such as KFC and private care homes.

An unnamed NHS Trust in the north of England is advertising the midwifery jobs through Active Business Consult, based in Cluj-Napoca, in the former Transylvania region.

Many of the jobs advertised have start dates of January 1, 2014, when the restrictions on Romanians working and living in the UK are lifted.

Thousands are expected to arrive, in a trend similar to the one that followed Poland’s accession in 2004.

According to recruitment website Tjobs, 59,377 UK jobs have been advertised through them this  year and 60,828 candidates have responded. Two years ago 41,715 were advertised.

One advertisement for taxi drivers 
claims ‘no experience required’ and illegally states that certain 
vacancies in the South East, are ‘female only’ positions.

It
 read: ‘It is not like being a taxi driver in Romania. You are supplied 
with jobs by the company. You will be self-employed and receive cash 
daily.’

Hundreds of taxi driver jobs are being advertised with applicants required to have just one month’s driving experience.

Another advertisement for 100 butchers’ positions declared: ‘Knowledge of English is not necessary!’

Peter Bone, Tory MP for 
Wellingborough, said the revelations about jobs fairs shows that ‘the 
number of people coming here is going to be in the thousands’.

He said: ‘We should stop Bulgarians and Romanians coming here after 1 January and worry about the EU afterwards.

'Having
 more and more people coming into this country is going to make matters 
worse. It is not good for social cohesion, it will put huge pressure on 
our public services, and it will make it harder for British people to 
get jobs.’

Romanian recruiters said they believed young people in the UK ‘didn’t want’ the blue-collar jobs.

Calin
 Stefanescu, chief executive of Tjobs, said: ‘The UK’s young population 
doesn’t want to work any more in a factory, or as welders, lock smiths, 
carpenters, in agriculture or as a nurses and waiters.

‘Countries like Poland, Romania and Bulgaria still have a large number of blue-collar workers available.’

And
 hospitality chiefs also defended their move to recruit in Romania – 
blaming the UK benefits culture, which they said made British youths 
reluctant to work.

Peter
 Hancock, chief executive of Pride of Britain Hotels, a consortium of 
luxury independent hotels, said: ‘It can be very difficult for job 
centres to persuade young British people to take advantage of the 
opportunities out there.

'One
 can only conclude that it is because they have the alternative of 
claiming benefits to provide them with the money for food and shelter.

He said Eastern Europeans have ‘a stronger work ethic’.

Jobs: Folders in the office of G&G Recruitment, sponsor of a career fair today for prospective migrants. The Bucharest firm's director, Sever Grosu, claims he gets 60 CVs a day from workers hoping to come to Britain

Yesterday, many workers at Obor Market, Bucharest’s largest market, said they were planning to leave for the UK.

Manu
 Arinel, 33, who currently earns less than £1.50-an-hour as a sales 
assistant, said: ‘I will go to work in the UK when there are no 
restrictions next year.

'I don’t speak good English, but I will do anything when I am there for a job.’

Sever Grosu, 
director of G&G Recruitment in Bucharest, is sponsoring a careers 
fair today for hospitality jobs in the UK. He claims he gets 60 CVs a 
day from workers hoping to migrate to Britain.

His
 office is full of ring binders stacked floor-to-ceiling titled ‘Chefs 
in UK’, ‘Waiters in UK’ and – ominously – ‘Black list never ever’ for 
poor-performing workers.

He told the Mail: ‘Marriott, Hilton, De Vere Hotels, we have found workers for all the big hotels companies in the UK.’

A
 recent study by the IRES, the Romanian Institute for Migration and 
Strategy, found the UK was the most-sought after destination to work 
among young Romanians.

A 
spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Overseas nurses make a 
very valuable contribution but should only ever work in the NHS if they 
have proven their competence and language skills.’
