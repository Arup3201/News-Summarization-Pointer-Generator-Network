Boeing's disaster-hit Dreamliner aircraft ran into trouble again yesterday when a Japan Airlines flight from Boston was forced to turn around and return to its destination.

The pilot of the 787 decided to return to Boston's Logan Airport due to a possible issue with the plane's fuel pump.

Last week, Heathrow Airport was temporarily shut down after a Dreamliner operated by Ethiopian Airlines developed a fire which has been linked to the battery in its emergency beacon.

The entire fleet of 787s was grounded earlier this year thanks to repeated faults in the lithium-ion batteries which sometimes led to plane fires.

Japan Airlines flight 007 from Logan to Tokyo's Narita Airport returned to Boston yesterday 'as a standard precautionary measure', according to a spokesman for the airline.

The pilot took action after seeing a maintenance message indicator suggesting there was a problem with the fuel pump.

He landed the plane safely and did not declare a state of emergency.

The plane left for Tokyo around 1pm EDT, and was expected to take around 14 hours to reach its destination, but landed again at Logan just before 6.30.

After the flight was cancelled, all its passengers were reassigned to other flights.

Japan Airlines 787s have previously malfunctioned at Logan on at least two occasions - in January, a battery fire broke out on a Dreamliner shortly after all its passengers had exited.

The next day, another 787 belonging to the airline leaked 40 gallons of fuel on the runway.

The latest Dreamliner fire, at Heathrow last Friday, caused the whole airport to be shut down for an hour and a half while firefighters battled the blaze.

It emerged yesterday that the fire had been caused by a fault in the lithium battery powering the plane's emergency beacon.

The beacon, which is used by emergency services to located the aircraft in the event of an accident, could now be disabled on all Dreamliners.

The battery is different to the lithium-ion battery which was responsible for a spate of fires earlier this year.

All 787s were grounded around the world in January this year while officials investigated the source of the problem.

The aircraft is the latest high-profile project from Boeing, which hoped that the Dreamliner would revolutionise commercial flight thanks to its innovative design.
