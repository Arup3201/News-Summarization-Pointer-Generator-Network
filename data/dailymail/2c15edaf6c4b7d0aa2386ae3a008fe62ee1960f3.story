A husband whose wife was stabbed to death has spoken of his anguish saying police are still trying to find out a motive and the man responsible for her murder.

Nicole Laube, 29, of Washington County was stabbed on August 19 while working at the Commons at Timber Creek apartment complex in Cedar Mill.

The mother-of-two managed to run for help and spoke to a tenant before collapsing and dying.

'The hard part is there's so many unanswered questions,' said husband Chris Laube told Fox 12.

'My head is constantly going through what happened, you know different scenarios. And you just don't have answers for it.'

Before she collapsed, Laube reportedly told a woman who lived in one of the apartments she had been stabbed and that her attacker was wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and camouflage pants, said Sgt. Bob Ray, a Washington County Sheriff's Office spokesman. 

She had been stabbed in the chest.

Deputies told FOX 12 they recently re-examined the field behind the apartment complex where Laube was killed. 

They said that during a search of the area they discovered items which they consider to be evidence.  

They would not comment on what that evidence is, or if it's suspicious in nature. 

The couple have a nine-year-old daughter and a toddler son as well as two step-daughters. 

The private reward for information that leads to an arrest in this case is now over $11,000, according to Dan Blackstone, who started the fund.
