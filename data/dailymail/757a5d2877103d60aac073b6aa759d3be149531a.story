Superman can famously fly faster than a speeding bullet – but the British actor who plays the superhero needs an ‘emotional support dog’ to board a plane.

Man Of Steel star Henry Cavill, 31, was seen arriving for a flight at Los Angeles’ LAX airport last week with his dog, which was wearing a vest with the words ‘Working. Do not pet. Emotional Support Dog’ emblazoned on it.

Under a unique US Department of Transportation rule, passengers are allowed to take their dogs on flights if they have a doctor’s letter stating the animal ‘is necessary to their mental health or treatment’.

Cavill’s fellow Hollywood star Ryan Gosling also has a doctor’s note allowing his dog George to fly with him.

Cavill bought his dog Kal-El – who was named after Superman’s own name on his home planet Krypton – last year with his then girlfriend, American actress Gina Carano.

Animal behaviour expert Dr David Sands said: ‘Many people get anxious when on a plane and it is much better for them to stroke a dog than to try to get over their fear by tucking into the alcohol.’

But consultant psychologist at the London Medical Centre, Ingrid Collins, said: ‘Plane journeys are ordeals for animals and I would not recommend them unless they were absolutely necessary.

'There is a danger that a sympathetic doctor will sign someone off to have their dog fly with them when they could probably do without it.’

It is not known where Cavill and Kal-El were flying to on Friday.
