Former U.S. President Bill Clinton isn't eyeing a return to the White House just yet, but he is thinking about what people will call him if his wife Hillary – the former first lady – becomes the 45th president.

First gentleman? FGOTUS? First man?

'Let's say, if a woman became president, we could – I could be called 'Adam.' I don't know,' Mr. Clinton told cooking show host Rachael Ray on Thursday, according to snippets released before the episode aired. 

The idea of the legendary lothario as 'first gentleman' usually brings eye-rolls from conservatives and lip-biting from liberals, but Hillary Clinton is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic Party's nomination next year. 

Given some of her husband's extracurricular activities during his 8-year presidency, having this particular 'gentleman' in the White House again – this time in the East Wing – would become an endless source of entertainment for late-night TV hosts.

When Hillary ran in 2008, Mr. Clinton told ABC News that he would 'not get underfoot too much' at the White House. 

'I don't want to get in the way,' he said then. 'I want to do what I am asked to do and what I am needed to do.'

He planned to have an East Wing office and a staff, and also to keep his New York City office at the Clinton Foundation's office.

'It's also not bad for America to have a former president out there helping people solve their problems,' Clinton added. 'I think that I could do a lot of double time, like if she wanted me to go someplace to work with some problem, I could also be doing my foundation work.'

In 2007 at the Aspen Ideas Festival, he suggested a twist on 'first lady,' saying a Scottish friend told him to embrace the title 'first laddie' instead.'

Officially, the Clintons would be introduced at public functions as 'The President of the United States and President Clinton,' according to White House protocol guidelines.

Similarly, when George W. Bush was presdient and his father would visit for formal events, press guidelines referred to them as 'The President of the United States and President Bush.'

If former Florida Governor Jeb Bush were to become president and his father were still around, the White House troika would be introduced at his inauguration as 'The President of the United States, President George W. Bush and President George H.W. Bush.'

But in the Clintons' orbit, Bill is already thinking past the first female president.

'You know, if the president is a man, you call the president's spouse 'the first lady,' he told Ray, 'so we'll have to cross this bridge if a gay couple [is ever in the White House].'

'We're joking about this,' Clinton said, 'but it's a serious decision. Serious decision for Hillary, serious decision for the country, and the world.'

'Look, I love my wife. Whatever she wants to do, I'm for. I think it'd be good for the country because she's the ablest person I've ever worked with.'

'If she decided not to do it,' he said, imagining the politically unlikely, 'I'd give her the bucket list, and we'd go check 'em off.'

That, at least, would remove the quirky question of what to call him.

POWER COUPLE: The Clintons could be the ultimate epicenter of American influence if Hillary wins the White House

When 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska, her husband Todd preferred to go by the honorific 'first dude.'

The title 'first lady' doesn't actually refer to the president's wife, but to the designated 'hostess' at the White House.

'First Lady' is the title of the hostess of the White House, not the President's wife.  

America has elected unmarried presidents, whose other female relatives filled the role.

James Buchanan never married; Grover Cleveland was wed while in office.

Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren and Chester Arthur were widowers when they were elected. The wives of John Tyler, Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilsondied during their presidencies. 

Technically speaking, America's youngest first lady was Chelsea Clinton – from Jan 3, 2000 to Jan 20, 2000.

During those 18 days, her father was still president while her mother had left the White House to become a U.S. senator.

So it's conceivable that if Bill Clinton chose to live outside the White House during a Hillary presidency, someone else – like Chelsea's husband Marc Mezvinsky – could be the 'first gentleman.'

He's a hedge fund manager on Wall Street, though, so he probably wouldn't like the new ZIP code.

Former first lady Laura Bush, in an interview with C-SPAN last year, mused about how the press scrutinized her fashion sense and hairdos, saying the spouse of the first female president shouldn't be let off the hook.

'Maybe we should be that way about the first gentleman also,' she said. 'and really critique the way they look all the time. Their choice of tie, or their hairstyle, or whatever.'

'Or maybe their weight,' she joked.

Bill Clinton was on Ray's show Thursday to hep her make a 'healthy game-day chili' for Super Bowl Sunday.

He would likely still be referred to as 'Mr. President,' the same as today, but he said in 2007 that he liked a Scottish friend's idea: 'first laddie'

'President Clinton' would suddenly no longer be enough to distinguish the two spouses

'First gentleman' has been the traditional choice in other countries
