The United States
government has taken the first steps to licensing firms to mine the moon. 

According to documents obtained by Reuters, U.S. companies
can stake claims to lunar territory through an existing
licensing process for space launches.

The Federal Aviation Administration, in a previously
undisclosed late-December letter to Bigelow Aerospace, said the
agency intends to 'leverage the FAA's existing launch licensing
authority to encourage private sector investments in space
systems by ensuring that commercial activities can be conducted
on a non-interference basis.'

The move would give firms exclusive rights to that territory - as well as related areasthat might be tapped for mining, exploration and other activities.

FAA letter noted a concern flagged by the U.S.
State Department that 'the national regulatory framework, in its
present form, is ill-equipped to enable the U.S. government to
fulfill its obligations' under a 1967 United Nations treaty,
which, in part, governs activities on the moon.

The United Nations Outer Space treaty, in part, requires
countries to authorize and supervise activities of
non-government entities that are operating in space, including
the moon. 

It also bans nuclear weapons in space, prohibits
national claims to celestial bodies and stipulates that space
exploration and development should benefit all countries.

In other words, experts said, Bigelow could set up one of
its proposed inflatable habitats on the moon, and expect to have
exclusive rights to that territory - as well as related areas
that might be tapped for mining, exploration and other
activities.

'We didn't give (Bigelow Aerospace) a license to land on the
moon. 

'We're talking about a payload review that would
potentially be part of a future launch license request. 

'But it
served a purpose of documenting a serious proposal for a U.S.
company to engage in this activity that has high-level policy
implications,' said the FAA letter's author, George Nield,
associate administrator for the FAA's Office of Commercial
Transportation.

'We recognize the private sector's need to protect its
assets and personnel on the moon or on other celestial bodies,'
the FAA wrote in the December letter to Bigelow Aerospace. 

The
company, based in Nevada, is developing the inflatable space
habitats. 

Bigelow requested the policy statement from the FAA,
which oversees commercial space transportation in the U.S.

The letter was coordinated with U.S. departments of State,
Defense, Commerce, as well as NASA and other agencies involved
in space operations. 

It expands the FAA's scope from launch
licensing to U.S. companies' planned activities on the moon, a
region currently governed only by the nearly 50-year old UN
space treaty.

Bigelow Aerospace is expected to begin testing a space
habitat aboard the International Space Station this year. 

The
company intends to then operate free-flying orbital outposts for
paying customers, including government agencies, research
organizations, businesses and even tourists. 

That would be
followed by a series of bases on the moon beginning around 2025,
a project estimated to cost about $12 billion.

Company founder Robert Bigelow said he intends to invest$300 million of his own funds, about $2.5 billion in hardwareand services from Bigelow Aerospace and raise the rest fromprivate investors.

But the letter also points to more legal and diplomatic work
that will have to be done to govern potential commercial
development of the moon or other extraterrestrial bodies.

'It's very much a wild west kind of mentality and approach
right now,' said John Thornton, chief executive of private owned
Astrobotic, a startup lunar transportation and services firm
competing in a $30 million Google-backed moon exploration XPrize
contest.

Among the pending issues is lunar property and mineral
rights, a topic that was discussed and tabled in the 1970s in a
sister UN proposal called the Moon Treaty. It was signed by just
nine countries, including France, but not the United States.

'It is important to remember that many space-faring nations
have national companies that engage in commercial space
activities. 

'They will definitely want to be part of the rule
making process,' said Joanne Gabrynowicz, a professor of space
law at University of Mississippi .

Once touched down, time capsules will be planted that can contain your own music or photos for £60.

The FAA's decision 'doesn't mean that there's ownership of
the moon,' Bigelow told Reuters.

 'It just means that somebody
else isn't licensed to land on top of you or land on top of
where exploration and prospecting activities are going on, which
may be quite a distance from the lunar station.'

Other companies could soon be testing rights to own what
they bring back from the moon. Moon Express, another aspiring
lunar transportation company, and also an XPrize contender,
intends to return moon dust or rocks on its third mission.

'The company does not see anything, including the Outer
Space Treaty, as being a barrier to our initial operations on
the moon,' said Moon Express co-founder and president Bob
Richards. That includes 'the right to bring stuff off the moon
and call it ours.'
