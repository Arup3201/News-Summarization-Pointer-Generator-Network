Lord Justice Leveson was accused of a ‘contemptuous’ refusal to answer ‘legitimate questions’ after insisting he would make no further comments on an affair between a counsel to his inquiry and a barrister representing celebrities.

The judge reacted with irritation to a letter from Tory MP Rob Wilson requesting further information about the relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne.

Mr Wilson, a parliamentary aide to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is calling for a full investigation by the Bar Standards Board, as a professional code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided lest the perception be created of ‘a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’.

Questions have been raised about whether the affair between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne tainted the findings of the Leveson report

Mr Sherborne, who represented actor Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to the romantic Greek island of Santorini with Ms Patry Hoskins, a married mother of two, in August last year. The visit took place while the inquiry was being conducted, although the couple claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’.

Parliamentary aide Rob Wilson described Lord Leveson's dismissal of his request for information as 'contemptuous'

They say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in November.

In
a letter to Mr Wilson yesterday, Lord Justice Leveson flatly rejected 
any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been 
tainted by the relationship.

The judge insisted that ‘every finding of fact, every conclusion and every recommendation’ in last year’s report was his alone and that Ms Patry Hoskins had no influence over them.

‘You ask whether it is possible that [Ms Patry Hoskins] may have had an input into the inquiry’s conclusions... the answer is “no”,’ he wrote.

‘Ms Patry Hoskins was second junior counsel to my inquiry and, throughout the process, undertook all of her work at the request and under the direction of either myself or Robert Jay QC...

‘As for her impact, I repeat from my report: ... every finding of fact, every conclusion and every recommendation is mine alone.’

Lord Justice Leveson added: ‘I am aware that you have written to the Bar Standards Board and it will be for the board, not me, to determine whether there has been any breach of the code of conduct.

‘In the meantime, I see no benefit in engaging in further public debate about the work of the inquiry or  the integrity of its processes: I do not intend to comment on this matter further.’

Standing firm: Lord Justice Leveson said he plans to make no further comment on the matter

Mr Wilson said Lord Justice Leveson had ‘contemptuously dismissed’ proper questions. He said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson’s response is highly unsatisfactory. In the past, the courts have rightly shown great humility and taken any perception of a conflict of interest or breach of confidence very seriously indeed.

‘Whole cases have been quashed where people assisting a judge are perceived to have a conflict of interest. Instead, Lord Justice Leveson has contemptuously dismissed perfectly legitimate questions about what work his counsel was doing, what access she might have had to confidential information, and what the nature of her relationship with Hacked Off’s barrister was during this time.

‘Leaving these questions unanswered doesn’t do the Leveson Inquiry or the legal profession any good.

‘I am frankly baffled as to why Leveson has acted in this way.’

Lord Justice Leveson was criticised after declining to take any questions from the media as he announced his findings last year.
