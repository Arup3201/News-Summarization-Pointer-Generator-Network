Admit it, some days you just don't feel like going to work.

And when those days come, whether we'd like to admit it or not, we call in sick -- even when we're not sick at all. 

The art of 'playing hooky' is a great way to get out of a day at the office, but with that comes one challenge: coming up with a credible excuse. And a survey for the online career site Careerbuilder.com has revealed that people have gotten creative, I mean really creative.

The survey, carried out by Harris Poll, sampled more than 3,000 U.S. workers from Aug. 11 to Sept. 5  looking at how many of them faked being sick this year as well as their excuses for doing so.

The survey found that 28 percent of employees have called in to work sick over the past year when they were feeling fine, down 4 percent from last year.

The excuses workers reportedly gave when taking a sick day ranged from one employee failing to come in to work because they 'just put a casserole in the oven' to another claiming they 'caught their uniform on fire by putting it in the microwave to dry.'

But wait, there's more.

Employers also reported hearing from employees that they couldn't come in to work because they 'accidently got on a plane' or 'had a lucky night and didn’t know where he was.' 

One employee also reportedly took the day off because their plastic surgery needed some 'tweaking.' 

The survey found that though 49 percent of the employees surveyed said they have Paid Time Programs which allows them to use their 'sick days' or 'vacation days' however they please, many felt obligated to give a reason for their absence -- even if that reason is a lie.  

Relax: Of those surveyed, 30 percent admitted that they simply did not feel like going to work and 29 percent said they called in sick because they just 'wanted to relax' (stock photo)

Thirty percent admitted that they simply did not feel like going to work and 29 percent said they called in sick because they just 'wanted to relax.' 

A phone call and a good excuse isn't the end of the line for playing hooky anymore, 31 percent of the employers surveyed said they checked up on these 'sick' employees. 

Some employers said they've required doctor's notes from their employees, some called the employees, and others even drove past the home of the absent workers, according to Careerbuilder. 

In some cases, employers don't even have to investigate, the employees unknowingly rat themselves out. One in four employers said that they've caught employees who have lied about being sick by simply checking social media.  

Although some of these employers have fired the employees, more than half said they only reprimanded the employee for lying.

Not all of the employees were 'playing hooky' though, 21 percent said they took the day off to actually attend a doctor's appointment. But the survey reports that 19 percent just wanted to catch up on sleep. 

The survey reports that employee absences seem to peak during the winter months with 11 percent of employees taking the day off due to bad weather or to spend time with friends and family during the holiday season. 

Despite the winter weather, phony excuses, and lethargy, the amount of employees that have called in sick has gone down.

CNN reports that many refuse to call in sick because of the responsibilty of their work or because they can't afford to lose a day's pay. 

The survey found that employees in the IT, Hospitality, and Retail and Leisure industries were least likely to call in sick with percentages between 20 and 22. 

The survey sampled 3,103 workers and 2,203 human resouce professionals and hiring managers across various industries. The workers surveryed were fulltime, non-governent, and non self-employed U.S. employees.
