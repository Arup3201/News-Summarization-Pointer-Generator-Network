Mauricio Pochettino wants to re-integrate Alex Pritchard into Tottenham's first-team squad next season.

The 21-year-old has spent the season on loan at Championship side Brentford, impressing for Mark Warburton's side in their fight for promotion.

Spurs have kept a close eye on Pritchard's progress this season and have been hugely impressed by what they have seen.

And White Hart Lane coaches believe Pritchard can become the next academy star to make an impact on the senior side from next season.

Pochettino has helped nurture the careers of homegrown talent such as Harry Kane and Ryan Mason since his arrival last summer.

And Pritchard, who has four England Under-21 caps, is in line to join Kane and Mason next season.

Speaking earlier this month, Bees boss Warburton said: 'He can dominate a football. Alex is at his best with the ball at his feet.

'He sees a pass. He’s the best player I’ve seen in this division, certainly, to receive the ball on the half-turn at pace.

Brentford boss Mark Warburton thinks that Pritchard is capable of improving Tottenham's squad

'Left or right side, he has the ability to take it on the half-turn and for us, how we play, that hurts the opposition.

'Technically he’s outstanding. For me, he is nailed on Premier League.

'I’d never be disrespectful enough to speak about what Spurs should do or could do with him.

'But in my opinion, I think he is more than good enough to go and positively impact their playing squad.'
