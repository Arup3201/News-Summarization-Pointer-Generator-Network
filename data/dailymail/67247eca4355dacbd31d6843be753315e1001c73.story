Former President George W. Bush said Thursday that his brother Jeb, the former Florida Governor, 'wants to be president' – but he hasn't made up his mind yet about running in 2016.

'He and I did a conversation,' the folksy former president said during a Fox News Channel interview.

'I, of course, was pushing him to run for president. He, of course, was saying, "I haven't made up my mind".'

'And I truly don't think that he has,' Bush said.

'And plus I don't think he liked it that his older brother was pushing him.'

Jeb Bush is part of a crowded potential field for the Republicans in 2016; his absence from public events has resulted in middling poll numbers.

The moderate base of the GOP is urging him to run as an alternative to seeking a third attempt for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. But the tea party wing of conservatives paints him as a 'RINO' – Republican In Name Only.

'I think he wants to be president,' George W. Bush said. 'I think he'd be a great president.'

'He understands what it’s like to be president ... He’s seen his dad, he’s seen his brother. And so, he’s a very thoughtful man and he’s weighing his options.'

The former chief executive also said he won't play armchair general and criticize the decisions President Barack Obama has made about military activity in the Middle East. 

But he said he agreed with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey's recommendation at the time that the U.S. leave a 'residual force' behind in Iraq instead of withdrawing completely.

'I did, yeah. ... I agreed with General Dempsey's assessment.'

Obama famously pulled all U.S. troops from Iraq after Bush had spent most of his presidency spending heavily to stabilize that country. 

The results of what military rank-and-file have taken to calling 'the Obama bug-out' included the rise of the ISIS terror army to fill the power vacuum left by retreating American forces.

Bush said he thought the U.S. should have left a residual military force in Iraq to fend off chaos, but insisted he's not going to play armchair general in his post-presidential years

'The president has to make the choices he thinks are important,' Bush said Thursday. 'I'm not going to second-guess our president. I understand how tough the job is.'

'And to have a former president bloviating and second-guessing, I don't think is good for the presidency or the country. He and his team will make the best-informed decisions they can make.'

Bush said he had great confidence in Joe Clancy, the interim Secret Service director who has taken the agency's reins following the sudden resignation of former director Julia Pierson. 

Clancy 'is a good man,' he said. 'And I trust his judgment a lot. Joe will do a good job.'

Bush has spent his post-presidency years staying largely away from TV cameras, working on his memoirs and learning to paint.

He said he doesn't miss the White House pressure cooker.

'I'm asked all the time, do I miss Washington?' he noted. 'And the answer is no.'

'You know, I miss being pampered. Other than that I don't miss much.'

But he seemed to take a jab at Obama for his recent 'latte salute,' in which the president half-heartedly saluted a pair of Marines with a coffee cup in his right hand.

'I do miss saluting men and women who have volunteered to serve our nation,' Bush said.
