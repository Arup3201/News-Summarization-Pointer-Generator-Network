It looks as though a lumberjack got halfway through chopping down this tree and just gave up.

But in fact the damage to this German birch has been caused by beavers.

The large, flat-tailed, semi-aquatic rodents are more usually associated with North America after the European variety was practically hunted to extinction.

In Germany since 1979, however, there has been a programme to reintroduce the animals - resulting in the horrendous damage to this birch in Bavaria's Legenwang municipality.

The animals like to snack on the bark of trees - particularly birch - resulting in this 'ringing' effect as they chew all the way around the trunk as high as they can reach.

But although these pictures might suggest otherwise, beavers are in fact good for woodland habitats, even trees.

Often regarded as nature's engineers, Beavers are known for building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes - known as 'lodges' - in the resulting pond.

Remarkably, the resourceful rodents 
also build canals to float building materials that are too heavy or 
unwieldy for them to haul over land.

It's through this natural tendency to build waterworks that beavers are a benefit to the woodlands where they are native.

Their
building efforts sponge up floodwaters, alleviate droughts and floods 
(because their dams keep water on the land longer), lesson erosion, and 
raise the water table, according to Beavers: Wetlands & Wildlife.

Beaver's constructions also act as the 'earth's kidneys' to purify water because silt collects upstream of older beaver dams, and toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, are broken down by microbes in the wetlands created.

That means that water downstream of dams is cleaner and needs less treatment for human use.

Populations of Eurasian beaver are recovering, aided by conservation efforts, after the species was nearly hunted to extinction in Europe for its fur and for scent gland secretions once believed to have healing qualities.

Because of these pressures, the beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century.

However, several thousand now live on the Elbe, the Rhone and in parts of Scandinavia, and they have been reintroduced in Scotland, Bavaria, Austria, Netherlands, Serbia, Denmark and Bulgaria.
