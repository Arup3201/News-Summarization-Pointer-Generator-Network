Builders who had not been paid for a month beat their employers to death as revenge and then buried their bodies in a shallow grave before covering it with concrete.

Timur Priznavsiesa, 30, and Rustam Karimov, 28, from Uzbekistan were working near the village of Mihailovo-Yartesevskaya in Western Russia's New Moscow region.

When they went more than a month without being paid, and their Russian employers repeatedly came up with excuses to delay handing over the cash, they hatched a plan to take revenge.

Timur Priznavsiesa and Rustam Karimov killed their boss Constantine Lazarev and the foreman Artem Bykov after going unpaid for more than a month. A police officer is pictured above with one of the bodies

After leaving the site at the end of their shift, the pair went back inside where they confronted boss Constantine Lazarev, 45, and the foreman Artem Bykov, 30.

But when the pair refused to pay, the workers attacked them, beating them to death with shovels before dragging their bodies to wasteland near the site, digging graves and throwing them inside.

They then poured concrete over them so they would not be found.

However, the bodies were found a week later by police looking for clues as to the disappearance of the men.

A police spokesman said: 'The bodies were discovered after they were reported missing by their families.

'When we questioned the builders none of them seemed particularly concerned, which raised our suspicions.

'After a week of intense investigation we eventually got a confession from two of the men who admitted to killing and burying the victims as revenge for not being paid.

'But we suspect more may have been involved, if not with the exact murder, then at least with its cover up.'
