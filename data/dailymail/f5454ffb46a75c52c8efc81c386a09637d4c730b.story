Skull pieces from an early human who lived 100,000 years ago in northern China suggest that inbreeding might have been common among our ancestors, a new study claims.

The remains found at Xujiayao, in the Nihewan Basin, have a now-rare congenital deformation usually only found in incestuously conceived offspring.

It adds to a growing body of archaeological evidence that human ancestors regularly inbred at least until the end of the Palaeolithic era.

Incest: A view of the Xujiayao site and internal and external view of the Xujiayao 11 skull piece with its position indicated on the drawing of a complete skull

Examination of the skull, known as Xujiayao 11, revealed an unusual perforation through the top of the brain case - an enlarged parietal foramen (EPF) or 'hole in the skull'.

The symptom is consistent with modern humans diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation in the homeobox genes ALX4 on chromosome 11 and MSX2 on chromosome 5.

These specific genetic mutations interfere with bone formation and prevent the closure of small holes in the back of the prenatal braincase, a process that is normally completed within the first five months of fetal development.

It occurs in about one out of every 25,000 modern human births and is associated with inbreeding.

Abnormality: Examination of the skull, known as Xujiayao 11, 
revealed an unusual perforation through the top of the brain case - an 
enlarged parietal foramen (EPF) or 'hole in the skull'

Although this genetic abnormality is 
sometimes associated with cognitive deficits, the older adult age of 
Xujiayao 11 suggests that any such deficits in this individual were 
minor.

Traces of genetic 
abnormalities, such as EPF, are seen unusually often in the skulls of 
Pleistocene humans, from early Homo erectus to the end of the 
Palaeolithic.

Study author 
Erik Trinkaus, professor of anthropology at Washington University, said:
 'The probability of finding one of these abnormalities in the small 
available sample of human fossils is very low, and the cumulative 
probability of finding so many is exceedingly small.

'The
 presence of the Xujiayao and other Pleistocene human abnormalities 
therefore suggests unusual population dynamics, most likely from high 
levels of inbreeding and local population instability.'

It
 therefore provides a background for understanding populational and 
cultural dynamics through much of human evolution, he added.

diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation in the homeobox genes ALX4 on 
chromosome 11 and MSX2 on chromosome 5

Speaking to LiveScience, Dr Trinkaus said: 'These populations were probably relatively isolated, very small and, as a consequence, fairly inbred.'

The apparently common occurrence of such genetic abnormalities 'reinforces the idea that during much of this period of human evolution, human populations were very small', he added.

The findings of the study, co-authored by Xiu-Jie Wu and Song Xing of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing, were published yesterday in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.

The discovery adds to growing evidence that early humans inbred often

That could be because populations were so small, researcher suggests
