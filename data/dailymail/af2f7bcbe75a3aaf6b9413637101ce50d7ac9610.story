Face for radio: Chris Moyles, as King Herod in Jesus Christ Superstar, has been axed from Channel 4

Loudmouth Chris Moyles’s bid to launch a TV career has taken a major blow after Channel 4 axed his show, privately declaring that ‘he just doesn’t work on screen’.

Since being dumped by Radio 1’s breakfast show, Moyles, 39, has made TV stardom his goal, even shedding over 5st to be more appealing to HD cameras.

The DJ has also cut ties with his loyal agent of ten years, Vivienne Clore, to sign with James Grant, the agency that represents prime-time stars Ant and Dec, Holly Willoughby and Vernon Kay.

However, Channel 4 bosses have decided Chris Moyles’s Quiz Night, which ran for six series between 2008 and 2012, will not return.

And they do not want to work with the DJ on another project.

Meanwhile, Sky Living dating show, Love Machine, which he hosts with former X Factor contestant Stacey Solomon, is also unlikely to be back.

My Channel 4 insider explains: ‘We tried with Chris. But the reality is he just doesn’t work on screen.

'Viewers never took to him. The problem wasn’t with the Quiz Night format, it was with Chris himself.’

Moyles had hoped to make another series of Quiz Night following his stint as King Herod in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s touring production of Jesus Christ Superstar.

But it is now back to the drawing board. A source close to him tells me: ‘He’s in America working on new projects.

Channel 4 was never the be all and end all to his future on TV. He’s very confident of having big news soon.’

Angering Auntie: Chris Moyles refused to take on anew role at the BBC after he was replaced as a presenter for Radio 1

However, Moyles has infuriated executives at the BBC since they replaced him on Radio 1’s breakfast show with Nick Grimshaw because he was considered too old for the youth station.

He’s been taken off the BBC payroll after he refused to consider a new role, despite being on a £1 million, two-year contract until 2014.

High demands: Sharon Osbourne may return to the X Factor if the price is right

When Sharon Osbourne quit The X Factor five years ago it was in a row over her salary as she demanded a £500,000 pay increase which would see her earn more than £2 million a year.

Now I hear money could again cause problems as Simon Cowell prepares to bring her back to the panel for the ITV talent show’s tenth anniversary.

Sharon, whose strained marriage to Ozzy Osbourne hit the headlines again this week, has existing work commitments in the U.S., where she is a panellist on daily show The Talk.

My X-Factor source reveals: ‘Sharon 
wants a lot of money either to commmute from Los Angeles to London every
 week or take a leave of absence from The Talk.’

But her stance is causing massive 
issues for producers as existing judge Nicole Scherzinger is also so far
 refusing to sign, suggesting her music career might be her priority 
this year.

My show source adds: ‘We’re unsure if this is a ploy for 
Nicole to also get a pay increase.’

Last year’s judge Tulisa has not been officially told if her services are required because she is viewed as a ‘back-up option’.

Hungarian shadow dancers Attraction — who stole the show on Saturday’s Britain’s Got Talent — are accused of being copycats.

Attraction is fast becoming the most popular act with bookies since Susan Boyle in 2009.

However, my sources on America’s Got Talent claim their routine is very similar to The Silhouettes, a dance troupe on the U.S. show in 2011. The American version featured the outlines of U.S. landmarks.

Same shadows: Hungarian dance troupe Attraction, who appeared on Britain's Got Talent on Saturday, have been caused of being a copycat act

‘Attraction was presented as being unique, but one search on YouTube makes it obvious that this was a concept pioneered by someone else,’ says my source.

A Britain’s Got Talent source confirmed: ‘We don’t deny Attraction are a similar act to The Silhouettes. But that couldn’t stop them auditioning.’

ITV has had 15 complaints about Attraction being from Hungary, given the show is Britain’s Got Talent, while there have been fewer than ten each about the sexually provocative lyrics in 11-year-old Arisxandra Libantino’s performance of One Night Only and Keri Graham’s erotic dance.

Hotly tipped magician Ben Earl had to get permission from the Government before signing with Channel 4 for his first major TV series.

Before launching a TV career, the  30-year-old, who is described as a ‘world-class sleight-of-hand artist’, was recruited by intelligence agencies to work with the military as a consultant on deception skills.

He tells me: ‘I can’t say who exactly I work for, but they were initially concerned about me doing the show. We came to an agreement that I wouldn’t use any of the specific tactics that I use during my sessions with the military on the show.’

His series, Trick Artist, begins next Friday.
