Wolves have signed Sunderland striker Danny Graham on loan until the end of the year.

The 29-year-old has moved to Molineux after playing just once for the Black Cats this season.

He will stay with Wolves until December 31 and will link up with his new club on Monday.

Graham went on loan to Middlesborough last season

Graham told the Sky Bet Championship club's official website: 'Wolves is a good club which has done very well over the last year and this is a good opportunity for me to try and play some regular football and get back to scoring goals.' 

Graham, who has not scored for the Black Cats in 14 games since a £5million move from Swansea in January 2013, went on loan to Hull and first club Middlesbrough last season.

Wolves could be without Nouha Dicko and Bakary Sako in January and February if Mali qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations and have been looking for extra firepower.

Loan striker Yannick Sagbo returned to Hull this week after failing to score in four games.

Wolves are ninth in the Championship and head coach Kenny Jackett believes Graham can help their promotion push.

'We feel this is a very good move for us,' said Jackett, to the club's official site.

'He has the goalscoring record that we are looking for and experience of playing up front in the Championship.

'With our forward line he brings another dimension now with his experience and goalscoring record.

'We look forward to him starting with us on Monday morning and working with the squad towards the Nottingham Forest game.'
