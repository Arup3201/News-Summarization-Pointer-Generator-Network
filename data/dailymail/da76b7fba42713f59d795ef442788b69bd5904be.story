Juan Mata insists finally getting into the groove for Manchester United towards the end of last season has put him in a good place ahead of Spain's defence of the World Cup.

Mata, who joined United from Chelsea in January for a club-record fee, was involved in the Spain squad in 2010 for their World Cup win in South Africa, and is hungry for more.

Speaking to Laureus.com, Mata said: 'Winning the World Cup for Spain and being part of the squad was probably my best moment in my career and one of the best moments in my life.

'The last three or four months for me were great. I played a lot. I scored some goals. So I am looking forward to being there and to try my best for the team.'

Mata, however, admits is was a difficult year for Manchester United under David Moyes, but is looking forward to a change in style with Dutchman Louis van Gaal at the helm.

He added: 'It's been a difficult year, but I think this season we will improve and we will try to win again, because Manchester United is about winning and fighting for titles.

'[Van Gaal] is a very experienced manager. He likes to play in an offensive way, so hopefully he can bring success and trophies to the club and to the players.'
