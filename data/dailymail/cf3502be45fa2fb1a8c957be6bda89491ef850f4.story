Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal will be ‘far more difficult to handle’ this season following the signing of the ‘tremendous’ Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona.

The Gunners ended a nine-year trophy drought by winning the FA Cup in May, and after Sanchez’s £30million switch was announced on Thursday afternoon, the Spanish midfielder said it would provide a huge boost for the club.

‘I’m very positive about next season. What the club has done today, signing Alexis Sanchez, is great,’ said Arteta, speaking at the launch of Arsenal’s new kit at Puma’s flagship store in Carnaby Street.

‘I know Alexis very well because I am a Barcelona fan and he has been tremendous in the last 12 months.

‘I spoke to him this morning. He said is very excited and wants to get involved as soon as possible and hopefully he can deliver.’

‘He is a player who is going to give us a boost and increase the scoring capacity of the team.’

Arteta said Sanchez will offer the kind of threat Arsenal were missing at times last season, particularly following injuries to attacking players like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey.

‘Arsenal is a club that is very good on the break, very good at exploiting space. I think with Sanchez we will be much more difficult to handle,’ he added.

‘I think we have been missing that pace in behind. Sometimes we played with Cazorla, Giroud, Wilshere up front – and we had no pace.’

Arteta also praised Joel Campbell, the Arsenal striker who starred in England’s group at the World Cup while playing for Costa Rica, and insisted that the forward has the talent necessary to make a name for himself at the Emirates.

‘I think he has been superb - for his club and for the national team at the World Cup. I was very impressed with him and I think he’s got at least the level to play for this club,’ said Arteta.

When asked if he thought Campbell had a future at Arsenal, he said: ‘That’s not for me to say but what I can tell you is that I think he’s got the capacity and the ability to play for Arsenal, that’s for sure.’

Arteta warned that Arsenal would need to improve on last season given that a number of their rivals have already strengthened their squads.

Chelsea have signed Sanchez’s former team-mate Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona, while Manchester United have sealed deals for Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao and Luke Shaw from Southampton.

With Luis Suarez set to move to Barcelona, Liverpool will also have a large transfer kitty to play with, and they have already bought Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton.

‘Hopefully bringing in a player like Sanchez means we will only get better. We are going to need to do that because the other top teams are strengthening and it is going to be a very exciting Premier League,’ he said.
