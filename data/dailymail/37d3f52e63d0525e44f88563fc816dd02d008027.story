Every restauranteur knows that good or bad reviews can have a major impact on their business.

In the past these were most likely to be written by expert food critics and printed in newspapers, with the eateries concerned often given a right to reply to less than flattering write-ups.

But in the age of the internet anyone can post anonymous complaints or compliments online before a wide audience - and new research has shown how crucial these reviews are to a restaurant's future.

Two economists at the University of California, Professor Michael Anderson and Professor Jeremy Magruder, have published their findings on the issue in this month's edition of the Economic Journal.

Their work focused on the impact of positive online ratings on 328 restaurants in the San Francisco area - and collated this information into a star rating system on Yelp.com, a ratings website.

Restaurants were given a rating on the site between one and five stars.

The study found that eateries with an improved rating of just half a star sold out their 7pm bookings on up to half of the days they were open, reports The Observer.

This increase was found to happen without any changes in prices or food quality - suggesting a strong link to the online reviews.

The economists admitted that establishing a cause and effect between the reviews and a restaurant's success was difficult because those that got good write-ups were likely to be popular anyway.

However, the study found that when a restaurant moved from 3.5 stars to 4 stars on the website the likelihood of it selling out during its busiest trading times rose by nearly 20 percent,The Observer reports.

The impact of online reviews was found to be even more pronounced when there was little other easily available information about the restaurants concerned.

The results of the study suggests that other popular rating websites, such as TripAdvisor, could have a similar impact on restaurant bookings.
