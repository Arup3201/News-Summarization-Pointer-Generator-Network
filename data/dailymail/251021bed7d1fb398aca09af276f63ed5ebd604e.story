Indulgent: Some pudding portions contain a woman's RDA of sugar

Diets go out the window at Christmas and it's no surprise that many of our favourite festive foods are high in sugar.

But with a few canny choices, you can cut down on your intake whilst still having a sweet Christmas.

Health coach, Laura Thomas, 27, a self-confessed former sugar addict, discovered there's a huge difference in the amount of sugar in the same products from leading supermarkets.

There's as much as 30g difference in the amount of sugar in a portion of Christmas pudding depending on whose offering you consume.

Sainsbury's christmas pudding comes in at the highest in sugar with a huge 56g per portion - that's more sugar than the NHS recommend women consume in a day.

In comparison, Waitrose Remy Martin Chanmpagne pud has 32g per portion.

'For what is essentially the same food, that's a big difference,' Laura told the MailOnline.

She added: 'I was very shocked when I first realised just how much sugar was actually in a single Christmas pudding portion, especially when you consider it's nearly all of a women's 50g daily limit in one go (and it's not unknown for people to have two portions).

'You can suddenly see how the pudding, mince pies, chocolate and alcohol could really add up to mean people are easily eating and drinking three times their daily sugar limit without even thinking twice. I think it's useful for people to just be aware of this so they are careful with portion sizes.'

Aldi and the Co-op's Christmas puds also came in high on the sweetness scale as they all had more than 50g of sugar per portion.

More sugary by half : Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Christmas pudding has 56g of sugar per portion, left, almost double that of the Waitrose Remy Martin pud

A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'Our Taste 
the Difference Hidden Cherry Centre Christmas Pudding is a once a year 
indulgent treat. It's very high fruit content, including the delicious 
hidden cherry centre, means that this pudding is naturally higher in 
sugar than a pudding with less fruit.'

The NHS recommend men have 70g of sugar a day and women 50g. Eating too much sugar contributes to health problems including tooth decay, obesity and developing type-2 diabetes.

Laura, who writes the blog happysugarhabits.com, said people don't need to deny themselves festive treats but they can cut down their sugar intake with some savvy choices and awareness of nutritional content.

She said: 'I'm often unpopular at this time of year as I'm telling people not to eat mince pies and drink mulled wine. But with a few simple food swaps you can cut down on how much sugar you have so it won't ruin your Christmas.'

Laura recommends: 'Keep sugar somewhat sensible by looking for puddings that are at least under 45g of sugar per portion and where sugar isn't the first ingredient. This at least means that the sugars are from the more natural fruit source rather than refined sugarcane.'

When it comes to mince pies, there's also a vast difference between sugar contents between the various supermarket products.

Sainsbury's Taste The Difference mince pies, left, are also high in sugar with 24.8g per pie compared to Heston from Waitrose mince pies which have 19.1g

Sainsbury's are the highest with their Taste the Difference Brandy Rich Mince Pies containing 24.8g per pie. Tesco Finest has 22g but Asda is far lower with 18g in their Chosen by You product.

Laura said: 'A single mince pie can have up to 30g of sugar (six teaspoons) so look for ones that come in under 20g. Even better opt for a mini mince pie which tend to average around 7g of sugar per portion.'

For an even healthier mince pie, Laura recommends ditching the supermarket varieties for baking your own.

She said: 'By making your own mince pies you can cut the sugar and the fat by using just dried fruit alone to sweeten the pie and swapping sweet shortcrust pastry with filo or puff pastry.'

She also recommends making your own mulled wine to cut down on sugar as pre-made versions will have more in order to preserve them for longer.

Festive foodie: Laura Thomas says you can cut down on sugar and still have a sweet Christmas with some savvy choices

Aside from mince pie and Christmas pud choices, Laura recommends keeping your sugar intake down by snacking on other festive treats such as nuts, satsumas and cheese.

If you do have chocolate she advises: 'Opt for dark chocolates over milk or white ones. Generally the higher per cent cocoa solids, the less sugar.'

She added: 'Don't eat food mindlessly over the Christmas period for the sake of it. You don't need to eat every sugary food that's offered to you. Mark out which days you'll treat yourself, look forward to them, and have some control with the rest.'

But there is hope for anyone who simply can't resist the sweet treats over Christmas and are happy to keep indulging till the New Year.

Laura will be running a six week 'Mentor Me Off Sugar' programme from 6th Jan which she said will help people combat their sugar cravings for good. So next Christmas, you won't be at the mercy of your sweet tooth. For more information, visit happysugarhabits.com
