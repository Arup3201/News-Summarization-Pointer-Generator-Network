Planted in a circling spirals, the tobacco fields of Wuning County, in southwest China's Guizhou Province create a stunning view from the air.

Since 2010 the local government has encouraged locals to grow tobacco rather than traditional crops due to its high return.

Now the county has more than 24,000 hectares of tobacco land with 46,000 households growing it. 

Livelihood: Rows of tobacco fields are seen in Wuning County, southwest China's Guizhou Province. Since 2010 the local government has encouraged locals to grow tobacco rather than traditional crops due to its high return

Profits: While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco, is not as profitable as cotton or sugar cane

And there are now plans to expand the growth of tobacco further in the next few years to 140,000 hectares, nearly 6 times the amount grown now.

While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco, is not as profitable as cotton or sugar cane.

This is because the Chinese government sets the market price and while this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price.

Yesterday was World No Tobacco Day, and saw the first official document from China's health ministry 
on the dangers of nicotine, according to the China Daily and People's Daily.

According to the report China accounts for about 40% of global production and consumption of tobacco -  it is now the world's biggest producer and consumer.

There are 300m smokers across the country, and it sees att least 1m deaths each year from smoking-related diseases, according to the report.

Covered in fields: From an aerial view, it looks like there are more tobacco fields than houses in the county
