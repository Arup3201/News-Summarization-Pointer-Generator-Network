Guilty: Former MLB star Lenny Dykstra, pictured in court in August, is facing up to four years jail|

Disgraced former New York Mets baseball star Lenny Dykstra is facing up to four years in jail after pleading guilty to car theft charges.

The one-time World Series hero, 48, 
pleaded no contest in Los Angeles Superior Court yesterday following 
what prosecutors describe as a scheme to lease cars using false business
and credit information.

Dykstra had originally faced 25 charges, including three counts of possession of a controlled substance, but the remainder of the case is set to be dismissed at sentencing under a plea deal struck yesterday.

Prosecutors said Dykstra and two associates ran a scheme to lease high-end cars from dealers using fraudulent information, while claiming credit using a false business called Home Free Systems.

In addition to three counts of grand theft auto, he pleaded no contest to one count of filing false financial statements.

Although Dykstra and his associates were rejected at two dealerships,Â  they drove off with three cars from another business.

Long career: Dykstra spent more than a decade in the major leagues and helped the Mets win the World Series in 1986

Dykstra's accountant, Robert Hymers, pleaded no contest earlier this year to a charge of identity theft in connection with his role in the scheme

Also, Dykstra's friend Christopher Gavanis pleaded no contest to a charge of filing a false financial statement. Hymers and Gavanis have not yet been sentenced.

Dykstra originally faced 25 criminal counts, including three counts of possession of a controlled substance, due to the alleged discovery of cocaine, Ecstasy and a synthetic growth hormone during a police search of his Los Angeles home.

Those charges were punishable by up to 12 years in prison. But Los Angeles prosecutors said on Wednesday the remainder of the case would be dismissed at sentencing under his plea deal.

Dykstra still faces two additional, unrelated criminal prosecutions. An indictment returned by a federal grand jury in May accuses him of stealing or destroying some $400,000 in property that was part of his bankruptcy case.

In August, he was charged in Los Angeles with exposing himself to a string of women who answered online employment advertisements he posted.

Dykstra, who bought a Ventura County mansion once owned by hockey star Wayne Gretzky, filed for bankruptcy two years ago, claiming he owed more than $31 million and had only $50,000 in assets.

Dykstra, pictured in a Californian court in June, also faced drug possession charges which are now set to be dismissed

In May, Mr Dykstra was investigated for lewd conduct by the LAPD after a woman complained that he allegedly invited her to his California mansion to apply for a housekeeper position, only to take all his clothes off and demand a massage.

The unnamed 47 year old claimed she answered a Craigslist advert.

She claims when she arrived at the house, thought to be his $18.5million Californian mansion, he told her she would be required to give him massages as well as clean.

Glittering career: Lenny Dykstra famously scored a key lead-off home run against the Boston Red Sox in October 1986

He then allegedly took all his 
clothes off and told her he couldn't hire her until he had tried out her
massaging skills, a police source told TMZ.

Nicknamed
'Nails' during his baseball career, Dykstra spent more than a decade in
the Major Leagues, mostly as an outfielder for the Mets and 
Philadelphia Phillies.

He
is perhaps best remembered by Mets fans for the 1986 season, when he 
struck a game-winning home run in Game 3 of the National League 
Championship Series.

In
Game 3 of the 1986 World Series, he hit a leadoff home run, sparking a 
comeback by the Mets from a 2-0 series deficit to win the championship 
over the Boston Red Sox.
