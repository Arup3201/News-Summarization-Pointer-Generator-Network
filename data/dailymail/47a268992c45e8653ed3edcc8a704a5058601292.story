David Moyes should not hesitate if offered the chance to manage Real Sociedad, according to their former boss Chris Coleman.

Reports suggest the Spanish outfit are in talks with the 51-year-old Scot, who left Manchester United in April after less than a year in charge, about replacing Jagoba Arrasate.

And Wales manager Coleman, who spent seven months at the helm from June 2007 to January 2008, gave the club a ringing endorsement.

Real Sociedad have confirmed that the club are in talks with former Manchester United manager David Moyes 

'If I was speaking to David I'd say - take the job,' he said. 'They have incredible fans and the city is absolutely crazy about the club.

'It was a great experience for me and when I look back on my managerial career that is probably my biggest regret - leaving Sociedad.

'It is a great club who were in the Champions League last year and if you are at that level, like Moyesy is, I'd say take it as they can be a force, they really can.

'San Sebastian is a great city, and a football city. If I was speaking to David I'd say take the job.'
