A woman was shamed into losing 10 stone after receiving size 22 jeans from her husband on Christmas Day - which didn't fit. 

Amy Gordon made a New Year’s Resolution to beat the bulge after that mortifying moment.

The 29-year-old said: ‘They were designer jeans, and my husband Andy said he wanted to treat me, but they were a size 22 and I felt so ashamed.

'What was worse was that I couldn’t actually get them over my hips.

'I pretended I was saving them for a special occasion - and felt humiliated all over again.’

At her heaviest, Amy Gordon was a size 22 and 18 stone, due to a diet of pizza, crisps and comfort eating. She vowed to lose weight after failing to get a pair of size 22 jeans over her hips - and taunts about her weight

The 29-year-old has dropped seven dress sizes and now weighs just 9st 6lb after 16 months of dieting 

And when a comedian laughed at her for being fat on a night out, it was the final straw.

The excruciating moment came when she was out with friends and and suddenly found herself in the spotlight.

'The comedian had made a few fat jokes already, but then he spotted me,’ she said.

'I tried to hide but it was impossible. He said “On a night out you can always pull a fat bird” and “Don’t worry, love, you can always be fat and pretty”.  

Mrs Gordon, of Wolverhampton, said: ‘I’ve always been a big girl but after the comedy show I felt humiliated. 

'It reduced me to tears but I knew I had to do something about my weight. It wasn’t easy though.'

Then a size 22, she tried a few weight loss plans with little success.

‘I began to live on toast, fruit and salads but although I lost weight, my periods stopped,’ she said. 

‘My mum was worried about me and she made sure I ate. 

'But I went from one extreme to another. I started bingeing on pizza, chips and cake and before I knew it, I was huge again.’

Looking back, she realised she had been doing this all of her life.

‘Mum had always cooked me dinners like shepherd’s pie. But I couldn’t resist buying chocolate and crisps from the tuck shop.'

Her size also made her a target for cruel comments. 'My classmates would laugh at me, call me Fatty and Dawn French and roar "hide the sweets" when I walked past.

'I put on a brave face, but back home I cried and comfort ate, making things worse.’ 

The excruciating moment came when she was out with friends and a comedian saw her and said: 'Don’t worry, love, you can always be fat and pretty'

After marrying husband Andy in April 2011, Mrs Gordon went from a size 16 (pictured) to size 22 again

Despairing, Mrs Gordon went on another diet and later met her husband-to-be, Andy, when she was a size 16. 

But happy and in love, the weight soon piled on again. She said: ‘After gaining weight I slimmed down for our wedding to a 16 again. 

‘I got married in April 2011 and I walked down the aisle in my dress feeling amazing.

'But afterwards I pigged out yet again and, lo and behold, I went back up to a size 22.’

It was Christmas 2012 that her new husband bought her the designer jeans which didn't fit.

‘He told me he wanted to treat me as I don’t buy many clothes,’ she recalled.

‘Looking at the size 22 label, I was so embarrassed, but I thanked him anyway.

'But when I tried them on I couldn’t get them over my thighs.’

It was this that inspired her to attend weight loss classes.

'When I joined Weight Watchers, I was just determined not to be the "pretty fat bird" any longer,' she said

'I decided after that to go on a proper diet once and for all. So in the January, I joined the local Weight Watchers.

‘When the leader, Dawn, told me I was 18 stone, I wasn’t surprised.

'I was just determined not to be the "pretty fat bird" any longer.’

She began to follow the plan, which encourages dieters to choose healthy alternatives and limit portion size.

Back home, she began to eat more fruit and vegetables, brown bread and pasta - and her husband joined in with her new, healthy diet to support her.  

The pair also joined the gym together.

‘By the following Christmas, Andy bought me size 12 jeans, not 22. It was brilliant,' said Mrs Gordon.  

This May, 16 months after beginning her weight loss challenge, she reached her target of 10 stone. She is now a svelte 9 stone 6lbs and a size 8.

‘It still amazes me,’ she said. 'I now actually look forward to getting clothes and lingerie.'
