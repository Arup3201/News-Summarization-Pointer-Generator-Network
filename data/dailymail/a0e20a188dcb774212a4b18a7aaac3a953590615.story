In the chaos of a burning building, a firefighter's senses are crucial. When smoke clouds the air, picking up on the roar of flames, the creak of collapsing floors, radio calls and cries for help can be the difference between life and death.

But one young recruit must do without such signs of danger - as he is deaf and cannot speak.

Joseph Ronan, 21, graduated from a first-stage firefighter training programme earlier this month and will soon begin volunteering at his local department in West Haven, Connecticut.

Suiting up: Deaf firefighter Joseph Ronan gets ready for another day tackling blazes in West Haven, Connecticut

'I like to help the community and prove the deaf community can do anything,' he told The New Haven Register, speaking in sign language as his mother Debra and friend Ashley Melendez interpreted.

Mr Ronan was born deaf, but his condition was not picked up until he was eight months old, when his family noticed he was not responding to sounds around him. Doctors soon diagnosed him with a genetic disorder called Waardenburg syndrome.

But even disability could not keep the young boy from harbouring ambitions of joining the fire service - a dream he is now days away from realising.

His mother told reporters how he had idolised firefighters when he was as young as four, and how he used to spend his nights watching documentaries about his heroes.

Challenge: Mr Ronan can communicate only through sign language and needed interpreters during his training

Mr Ronan spent much of his education in mainstream schools, though he later enrolled at the American School for the Deaf.

After graduating at the age of 19 he spent a few months at a community college, but none of the courses offered there could compare to his true calling.

Soon he began turning up to monthly meetings at the North End Hose Co. 3 fire station, where government interpreters from the Bureau of Rehabilitation Services helped him find out how he could be a part of the team.

In January he began classes with the fire school, learning all about the tricks and tools of the trade, from ladders to hoses, hazmat suits to search and rescue operations.

Before long he was out on training exercises, charging bravely into concrete buildings filled with blazing hay and helping to extinguish the flames.

'I went to watch him one day and I was like, "Oh Lord". I was thinking he’s crazy,' his mother, Debra, told the Register.

'I was very proud to watch him. He was really focused, and I was really happy to see how the class kind of all came around him to help him learn how to work inside of a fire. I was really proud to watch him doing such a, to me, scary thing.'

Determined: Mr Ronan has dreamed of being a firefighter since the age of four

In training, Mr Ronan benefited from the support of his fellow students, who would tell him which way to turn by tapping his left or right leg, or tap the ladder to tell him to lift it.

Now his colleagues at the station hope to take this team spirit to the next level by learning how to communicate with Mr Ronan through sign language.

He will be working under district chief James O'Brien, who praised the rookie firefighter for his determination and independent spirit. Together they will figure out the limitations on Mr Ronan's duties, and exactly how he will be able to help on callouts.

Though he now holds a certificate for the first stage of training, his disability means the state authorities refuse to let him work as a fully-fledged, paid crew member.

Mr Ronan expects he will be able to help out with car crashes, handling hazardous materials, giving first aid and putting out brush, tree and grass fires. Even though he will not be allowed to enter burning buildings, he will pitch in with vital support work from the outside, setting up safety equipment, hooking up fire hydrants and handling the crew's oxygen tanks.

Surprisingly, he is not alone in facing this unusual challenge and said he knows of a few other deaf or hearing-impaired volunteer firefighters working in Connecticut.

Mr Ronan wanted to thank the teachers and classmates who helped him towards qualification, while his proud father Sean pointed out what an achievement passing the training course had been - especially as only 21 of 30 students graduated.

According to Jamie Vincent, director of the fire school, Mr Ronan's disability is not as much of an impediment as it may seem.

He told the Register: 'The instructors and students alike all said it doesn’t make a difference if you’re deaf or blind: You can’t see or hear anything inside a burning building anyway, so it basically made everyone level.'
