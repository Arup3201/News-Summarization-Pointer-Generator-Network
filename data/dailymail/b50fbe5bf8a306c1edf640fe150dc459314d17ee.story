Children are five times more likely to become obese if their older brother or sister is overweight, a new study has found.

An only child is 2.2 times more likely to put on excess weight if one of their parents is obese, according to a survey.

But while parental influence is well documented, a child with an obese older sibling is much more likely to become overweight, with the risk shooting up 5.6 times.

It comes as a second piece of research suggests eating out with healthy friends can help a person shed the pounds, as people are influenced by their peers' food choices.

A survey, which assessed more than 10,200 households in the U.S., found childhood obesity varied according to the number of children as well as their gender.

Meanwhile, older children in a two-child household with an obese parent are 2.3 times more likely to be obese - but that number jumps to 5.4 times for those with overweight younger siblings.

The research was carried out by experts from Massachusetts General Hospital, Cornell University, and Duke University.

Their findings were published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Lead investigator Mark C. Pachucki said: ‘We found that obesity status of a younger child's older sibling is more strongly associated with a child's obesity than is the parent's obesity status.’

The report found that only children were less likely to exercise and more likely to eat fast food than those with brothers and sisters

‘This association is independent of a host of socioeconomic and demographic attributes, health behaviours, and overall health status.’

He added that the findings were ‘consistent with research showing that siblings tend to eat alike and have similar levels of physical activity’.

The survey also revealed a link between gender and the risk of obesity with younger children more susceptible to the influence of an older brother or sister if that sibling is of the same sex.

Only 
children were also found to be less likely to exercise and more likely 
to eat fast food than those with brothers and sisters.

But data also showed that having a very active older sibling upped the obesity risk for the younger brother or sister.

Mr Pachucki added: 'Younger
 children look up to their big brother or sister for behavioral cues, 
often seeking their approval; and siblings may spend more time each 
other than with their parents, often eating and playing sports 
together.'

Healthy friends can help influence our meal choices at restaurants, research has found

Eating out with healthy friends can have a positive impact on an individual’s food choices, a study has found.

Research has revealed that diners tend to order similar dishes to their friends when in groups at restaurants.

Experts looked at receipts from nearly 1,500 people who ate in groups at an eatery in Oklahoma, U.S. over a period of 19-weeks.

Dishes were divided in to eight food categories such as soups, salads, pasta dishes and daily specials.

While many of those who dined together appeared to choose different dishes, they tended to choose from the same categories.

The research was carried out by experts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics.

It found that the popularity of salads and vegetarian dishes shot up when more than one person in the group ordered healthier dishes.

According to the website scientificamerican.com, study researcher Brenna Ellison said: ‘We want to be different from our friends a little bit, but not too different.

She added: ‘People are happier spending money and eating more calories as long as their peers are.’
