Andrew Raybould, 30, died of blood poisoning at Walsall Manor Hospital this February after being sent home from hospital  three times previously

A bus driver died of blood poisoning after being sent him home from hospital three times as doctors allegedly failed to diagnose his condition.

In December 2011, Andrew Raybould had been suffering from severe stomach pains, nausea, vomiting and constipation.

The 30-year-old was sent home from Walsall Manor Hospital three times by staff who didn't know what was wrong with him, his family claim.

By the end of January 2012 he had lost two stone in weight and was in constant pain.

He was once again admitted to hospital and was finally diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure and sepsis and admitted to intensive care, but died a few days later in early February.

His family have now complained to the hospital trust charged with their son's care and hired lawyers to look at the case.

The trust said it is investigating Mr Raybould's death and will liaise closely with his family.

Mr Raybould's mother Maureen, 58, of Aldridge, in the West Midlands, said  her son's death has torn hers and her husband Geoff's world apart.

She said: 'Geoff and I are heartbroken by Andrew's death and we are still struggling to come to terms with everything that has happened.

'It was awful watching him suffer in agony but we felt helpless as hospital staff kept discharging him without us being told the cause of his symptoms.

'When we were told that there was nothing more that could be done for our son it felt like our world came crashing down around us. 

'He was only 30 and should have had a long and happy life ahead of him.

'We believe more could have been done by the hospital staff to diagnose Andrew's conditions quicker, meaning he would have had access to treatment.'

She and her husband have hired Birmingham-based law firm Irwin Mitchell to determine whether the hospital could have done more to save their son's life.

Mrs Raybould said: 'We just hope that lessons will be learned from any failures found in his care in the hope that no other parents have to go through the trauma of losing their child to a treatable condition.'

Rebecca Risby, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, said the firm is looking into Mr Raybould's treatment by the hospital.

Mr and Mrs Raybould have complained to the hospital trust and  hired a law firm to investigate their son's death, which they said has left them 'heartbroken'

Within a month of being sent home from hospital, Mr Newbould had lost two stone in weight and was in constant pain. He was diagnosed with pancreatitis and sepsis when he was admitted to hospital once again

She said: 'This is a tragic case that has seen a young man's life cut short.

'It was not until Andrew became critically ill that pancreatitis and sepsis were diagnosed, by which time it was too late for him to undergo any treatment. 

'We are investigating his care and will be contacting the trust in the coming weeks regarding the treatment provided to Andrew.

'Sepsis is a devastating condition which causes the major organs to shut down, but if caught early enough, it can be treated with intravenous antibiotics.'

Mr Amir Khan, Medical Director at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'We are aware that there have been a number of concerns raised around the death of Mr Raybould whilst in our care.

'A formal complaint has been made through our Patient Relations service which we have taken very seriously and, as a result, have undertaken a full investigation and will continue to liaise closely with the family to share our findings.'

Mr Newbould's family said that at 30 years old he should have had a long and happy life ahead of him
