Ian Poulter vented his frustration on Twitter after his putting troubles continued at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, despite advice from major winner Greg Norman.

The world No 26 is 12 shots behind leaders Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Henrik Stenson after three rounds in Dubai having carded 75, 69 and 70 to lie in 41st place on two under.

Norman, a former world No1 and two-time major winner, Tweeted Poulter last weekend saying he had an 'easy fix' to his putting problems after watching Poulter in action at the Turkish Open, and the pair discussed the issue on Wednesday before play commenced in Dubai.

'I spoke to Greg last night,' Poulter said on Wednesday, 'I know him really well. It was really nice of him to reach out. 

'He noticed a couple of things, he had some observations. I respect his opinion and I will take on board what he said.'

However unfortunately for Poulter his putting has continued to hinder his game in Dubai as he tweeted after his third round 'Argh 1 more round for 2014. Brain is on melt down. Putter hunting for 2015.'
