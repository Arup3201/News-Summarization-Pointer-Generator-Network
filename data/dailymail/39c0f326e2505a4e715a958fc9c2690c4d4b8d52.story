Five Taliban militants were killed in a US drone strike on a hideout in northwestern Pakistan today as the military response to this week's school massacre continues to intensify.

In a separate operation, officials say Pakistani security forces also killed seven 'terrorists' on the outskirts of Peshawar - where the atrocity unfolded on Tuesday morning.

Since the appalling attack - in which 148 people, mostly children, were murdered - Pakistani air strikes and ground operations have killed around 200 militants in the northwest tribal region near the Afghan border.

Retribution: Pakistani military forces have intensified their efforts against the Taliban following Tuesday's slaughter in which 148 people were murdered

The US drone strike took place in the town of Datta Khel in North Waziristan, where Pakistani troops have been carrying out a major operation against local and foreign militants since June.

Security officials say the men killed in the drone strike fought under local Pakistani Taliban warlord Hafiz Gul Bahadur.

It is unclear whether the drone strike hit militants directly involved in the slaughter at Peshawar as US officials rarely if ever comment on the covert drone program.

The weapon has eliminated several top militants - but has also resulted in civilian casualties, making it extremely unpopular among Pakistanis.

Retribution: The violence at a school (pictured) in Pakistan's northwest earlier this week stunned the country and brought cries for retribution

Yesterday morning, troops killed 18 more militants during a 'cordon and search operation' in Khyber, the military said

Pakistan has described the bloody rampage in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Tuesday as its own 'mini 9/11', saying it was a game changer in its fight against terror.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif relinquished the six-year ban on the death penalty in terror-related cases two days after the school attack - with two convicted terrorists the first to be hanged yesterday.

Today Human Rights groups condemned the decision - labelling it as 'a craven politicized reaction to the Peshawar killings'.

The Human Rights Watch added: 'Pakistan’s government has chosen to indulge in vengeful blood-lust instead of finding and prosecuting those responsible for the horrific Peshawar attack.'

Yesterday photos were released showing the bodied of 18 militants covered by sheets - killed by Pakistan's security forces in the country's northwest tribal region of Khyber. 

Khyber Agency is one of two main areas in the where the military has been trying to root out militants in recent months. 

It borders Peshawar, where the school massacre happened, and militants have traditionally attacked the city before fleeing into the tribal region where police can't chase them.

The other area being targeted by anti-terror forces is North Waziristan - where today's US drone killed five militants.

In a direct video message Khalifa Omar Mansoor said: 'If our women and children died as martyrs your children will not escape'

In response to the Prime Minister's hardline approach Taliban commander Khalifa Omar Mansoor has warned the Army: 'If our women and children died as martyrs your children will not escape.'

In a direct video message, the mass murderer nicknamed 'slim' and described as 'the most hated – and dangerous' man in Pakistan, said: 'I want to tell the Pakistan government, and the directors, teachers and students of the army's affiliated institutions, that you are the ones strengthening this un-Islamic democratic system.

'It is these institutions that graduate future generals, brigadiers and majors, who then kill Taliban and innocent tribal people.'
