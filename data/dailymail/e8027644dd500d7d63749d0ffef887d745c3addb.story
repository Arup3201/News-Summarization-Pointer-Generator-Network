Time to stop the moaning, Louis

Louis van Gaal has spent the holidays moaning about the fixture list but I don’t understand why he’s so upset.

When he came to the Premier League he knew exactly what he was letting himself in for. Festive football is one of the best things about our league. To arrive here and start complaining makes it look like he hasn’t done his homework.

When he first made the comments after the Tottenham game, I thought Van Gaal was joking. It was the first time in 85 games that United had named an unchanged line-up. He has rotated his squad more than anybody this season and then he starts kicking up a fuss about tiredness? Do me a favour.

There are plenty of managers who would love to have the kind of options Van Gaal has in his squad. He gets paid vast sums to figure out how to deal with situations like this.

It’s odd behaviour but it relays to the players and gives them a ready-made excuse not to perform. Luckily for Van Gaal, he still has some very willing runners in his team.

Four United players have played every minute since Boxing Day. But, as our table shows, rather than getting increasingly tired, they actually covered more miles on Thursday than in any of their other games.

More brilliance from Bony 

I'm not going to lie. I wasn’t happy seeing Wilfried Bony score a late equaliser at QPR.

But I had a funny feeling he would do just that.

Leroy Fer scored an absolute screamer, as our graphic  shows, but Bony delivered yet again.

He is one of the most-coveted centre forwards in football right now and with good reason.

He is one of the best I’ve seen at holding up the ball, he links so well and he has ice in his veins.

He could play and prosper in any team.

Spurs hit Jose for a famous five

On Thursday we had the result of the season at White Hart Lane.

Who saw Chelsea getting hammered 5-3 by Tottenham? Not me.

It was their best performance for years to beat a team of Chelsea’s quality, and scoring five goals, too. Only one other team in history has put five past a Jose Mourinho side — Barcelona when they beat Real Madrid 5-0 in 2010. Make no mistake, this was a massive result.

Chelsea have won nine out of nine at home but dropped 14 points on the road.

It’s a game that has blown the title race wide open and now you have to put Tottenham down as genuine top four contenders.

Harry Kane was unplayable and he terrorised a top defence. His work-rate inspires his team-mates and he is the difference for Spurs. For Mauricio Pochettino, it’s a great confidence boost. He looks like he could be the right man for the job and Spurs fans will be looking forward to seeing what he can achieve with the right investment.

For Jose, it’s a huge blow. This was a shock and their away form is a real problem.

Martinez has a Blue Christmas

What a miserable festive period it has been for Everton. They have not lost four straight games since 2005 and have slipped down the table.

Roberto Martinez is a good manager and I admire his attacking style. It’s easy for people to say that makes them vulnerable but I didn’t hear any complaints about it last season.

It’s easy to blame systems but it’s been a tough season and they look like they lack confidence. Maybe it’s time for the club to help Martinez freshen up his squad.

Foxes are festive winners

Thursday felt like a big day at the bottom of the Premier League. Leicester and Burnley both came from behind to earn a draw and that late equaliser was a kick in the teeth for QPR.

It’s still early days in the relegation fight and it’s all still so tight - just six points separate the bottom seven sides.

But survival is is all about confidence. Burnley have fought so hard and got good results and Hull stopped the rot. But with a win at Hull and rescuing a draw at Anfield, Leicester have been one of the biggest winners at the bottom this Christmas.

Could Frank be the difference?

Frank Lampard's incredible season goes on. Another game, another goal. It’s becoming a familiar story for City.

Nobody saw the move coming, and people are keen to criticise Chelsea for letting him go. But, in fairness, you can’t say the decision has weakened their team. Where it is starting to hurt them is in the table.

Thursday’s winner was the latest in a long line of key goals for City, and the tables below show how important he has become. If you take away Frank’s goals, City would be seven points off the pace. With them, they are dead level and bang in the title race.

2 - Leicester should be proud of their comeback at Anfield. Only twice before in the Premier League have Liverpool surrendered a two-goal lead at Anfield to draw. It happened twice in September 2002 — first in a 2-2 draw with Newcastle and then a 2-2 draw with Birmingham a week later. Strangely, their last result before those games was a 2-2 draw away at Blackburn.

3 - Given his goal-scoring record, it may come as some surprise that this is the first time Yaya Toure has scored in three consecutive Premier League games.

53 - He might not be a creative playmaker, but Peter Crouch now has 53 assists in the Premier League, the same number as Robin van Persie.

33 - Let's hope the Premier League has started 2015 as it means to go on. There were 33 goals scored on Thursday, the most on New Year’s Day in the Premier League and the most since 34 went in on January 1, 1987.

77 - Antolin Alcaraz’s red card completed a miserable afternoon for Everton. They now have 77 Premier League reds — more than any other team.

653 - After seven goals in his first nine PL games this season, Saido Berahino finally ended a goal-drought of 653 minutes against West Ham. His last was against Palace in October.

11 - Aston Villa have scored just 11 goals so far this season. Only two sides in Premier League history have scored fewer goals after 20 games — Man City and Derby both scored 10 in 1995-96 and 2007-08 respectively.
