Gary Ellis used five-year-old daughter he hardly sees to claim right to a family life

He has been in prison three times for drug dealing and robbery

It follows Lord Chief Justice's assertion that Human Rights Act should not always be a trump card

Alienated: Selese Whiley (left) claims Gary Ellis rarely sees their daughter despite using his 'right to family life' to help him remain in the UK

A violent Jamaican drug dealer has twice used the Humans Rights Act to avoid being deported from Britain, it emerged today.

Gary Ellis, from Tottenham in north London, was allowed to stay because of his 'right to family life', despite the fact he rarely sees his five-year-old daughter or the child's mother.

It is the latest in a string of cases in which criminals have used humans rights laws to escape punishment for their misdemeanors.

Last week, the Lord Chief Justice cast doubt on the European Court of Human Rights, saying that when it conflicts with UK law, 'maybe Strasbourg shouldn't win'.

Ellis, 23, split up with Selese Whiley in 2007 and has been in and out of prison ever since, maintaining almost no contact with their daughter Kyra.

Miss Whiley, 23, told the Sunday Telegraph she had refused to give evidence to support him in court this summer.

But the Home Office's appeal, which followed their second attempt to deport Ellis, was rejected by Judge Davin Gill.

Miss Whiley said: 'He called me to ask me to go to court 
and say that he was a good father and we were still together. But I told
 him I wasn't willing to lie for him. 

'He's always been in and out of jail. I don't understand how the government have let him stay.'

The nonsensical human rights act just
 days ago led to 88-year-old Lydia Werrett being threatened with 
deportation to her native Zimbabwe, where she had received death 
threats.

Meanwhile, one of Robert Mugabe's 
torturers has been allowed to stay here because of fears it would breach
 his human rights to deport him.

Ellis also claimed that threats had been made against Miss Whiley and his daughter, but she denied this had ever happened.

'He's
 used us as a reason to avoid deportation,' she told the newspaper. 
'He's been a bad father to Kyra and we haven't been together for four 
years.'

Problematic: Britain's Home Secretary Theresa May is bound by the Human Rights Act

Ellis
 came to Britain from Jamaica on a visitor's visa in 2001, aged 14. He 
was jailed for a year for robbery and two counts of attempted robbery in
 2004 and then received 30 months for supplying Class A drugs in in 
April 2007.

The Home Office
 then tried to deport him, but he appealed on the basis of Article 8 of 
the European Convention on Humans Rights, which enshrines the rights of 
everyone to respect for private and family life. 

Immigration Judge Kamini Roopnarine-Davies ruled that he should 
be allowed to remain in Britain -
 even though the couple had separated by then, according to Miss 
Whiley.

He was then given 
another 30 months for possession with intent to supply Class A drugs in 
September 2009, after which the Home Office again tried to deport him.

But
 Immigration Judge Ifeyinwa Munonyedi and magistrate Andrew Richardso 
found Ellis had 'established family life with his partner, 
Miss Whiley, and their daughter', and that he was a 'fully integrated 
member of British society'.

They also found told the court that 'Kyra's well-being was best promoted by allowing 
her to grow up in her own country, having a normal father-and-daughter 
relationship with her father'.

But
 Miss Whiley told the Sunday Telegraph that Ellis - who is also known as
 Steve, Trapstar Ellis and Steve Da trapper - has never contributed 
money towards Kyra's upbringing. 

'He wouldn't be welcome in my home,' Miss Whiley said. 'Even when I've asked him for money for Kyra he's said no because he thought I would spend it on myself.

'I think he's only ever bought her one birthday present – and
 he was in prison at the time so he had to get his friend to buy it for 
her.

'He always makes a point of flashing his cash so that I can see how 
much money he's got – even though he won't give me any of it for Kyra.'

In her ruling in the most recent appeal, Senior Immigration Judge Davin Gill 
said the lower court found that Ellis had been 'put under considerable 
pressure to co-operate with a drug dealer'.

Judge Gill said that
 he had been given no help after repeatedly telling his probation 
officer about threats being made to Miss Whiley and her mother.

Ellis claimed he owed a drug dealer £2,000 and had been intimidated into 
committing another crime because of the debt.

Miss Whiley said: 'He's got a new girlfriend 
now who is pregnant so that makes it even more unlikely that he'll be 
deported.

'I think it's 
an outrage. He's been in jail three times now and he just keeps 
reoffending so I don't understand why they can't get rid of him.'

'He thinks he's invincible.

'He's not a good person. He's always been in and out of trouble – even 
when we went to secondary school together – but I hoped that when we had
 a daughter together he would mend his ways.

'Unfortunately he never did. He's never really gone out to look for a
 job but that was probably because he felt that dealing drugs was easy 
money.

'I don't think he'll ever mend his ways. He's been given countless opportunities but hasn't taken them.'

Sir Andrew Green, of MigrationWatch, said: "This is another ludicrous case to try the patience of the public.

'The courts should not accept claims to family life without closely examining the evidence.

'It is very surprising that this claimant's story was accepted at face 
value and it makes one wonder how many other similar cases there have 
been.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We rigorously defended our decision to 
deport this individual and we made it clear that he'd failed to provide 
supporting evidence to show existing family life.

Overruled: The Home Office failed in two attempts to deport Ellis, and their appeal was refused this summer

'It's unacceptable that the Human Rights Act is being used to prevent removal of foreign criminals and immigration offenders.

'This is why we will change the immigration rules to prevent those 
abuses and ensure a better balance with human rights and the wider 
public interest.'

Dominic Raab, the Tory MP who is campaigning to reform Article 8, said: 'This is a damning indictment of the system.

'Not only has another serious criminal defied deportation on spurious human rights grounds. On top of that, this case lays bare the institutional failings inherited from the last government.

'Lawyers milking the system, immigration officials failing to test his family links and judges overturning the public interest in deporting a convicted drug dealer and robber on the flimsiest of evidence.

'The case for fundamental reform is now overwhelming.'

David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, added: 'Clearly there has been a systematic failure. We need to challenge every case fiercely on the facts, which has not happened here.'
