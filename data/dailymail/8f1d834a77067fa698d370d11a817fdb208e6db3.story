Channel 4's Can Have Sex, Will Have Sex, which will be broadcast later this month, focuses on the sex lives of four disabled individuals. Posed by models

Channel 4 is set to show a controversial documentary which sees a mother hire an escort to help her son who has learning difficulties lose his virginity.

Can Have Sex, Will Have Sex, which will be broadcast later this month, focuses on the sex lives of four disabled individuals.

Among them is John, 26, who has never had a girlfriend, which leads to his mother making the decision to arrange his hired 'help'.

Also featured are recently paralysed Karl, who is 
coming to terms with life without an erection; and cerebral palsy 
sufferer Pete, whose hoist helps him into every conceivable sexual 
position and has ambitions to be the UK’s first disabled porn star.

The fourth subject is Leah, 24, who has brittle
bone disease but won’t let her body’s limitations get in the way of an 
adventurous sex life.

A Channel 4 spokeswoman defended the 
show yesterday, telling the Daily Star: 'The film explores the different ways disabled
people deal with the barriers they can face in trying to fulfill that 
basic human need - sexual intimacy.'

Its website describes the show as 'warm, funny and extraordinary in the range and scope of access to people’s very personal stories'.

Last week, Channel 4 received a number of complaints after it aired 40 Year Old Virgins, while pressure group Mediawatch suggested it came close to being voyeurism.

The documentary, which went out Thursday, saw 45-year-old Clive Dancey and a 29-year-old woman, who had both never had sex, head to America for a radical two-week course of sex therapy to help them face their fears of intimacy.

Mr Dancey, who lives in Hertfordshire, is later shown having a sex act performed on him 
by 68-year-old sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Green, who estimates she has slept 
with 850 men.

However, it has since been claimed he was an actor who was not a virgin when the show was filmed.
