Food safety officials have recalled 22,737lb of ground beef over fears that it could be contaminated with E.coli.

Although no illnesses have been reported, the ground beef was classed as a Class I health hazard meaning it was probable that the meat would cause serious health problems. 

The food, with a sell by date of June 14, was flagged up during a routine inspection at the National Beef Packing company in Liberal, Kansas.

Health fears: Nearly 23,000lb of ground beef from Kansas has been recalled after an inspector found E.coli

The United States Food Safety and Inspection Service is concerned that some shoppers may still have the potentially contaminated food in their freezers.

An inspector found E.coli in a sample from the company during a routine inspection, which led to a voluntary recall of the meat.

Young children, the elderly and sick are at particular risk from E.coli, which causes diarrhea, dehydration and, in extreme cases, death.

Shoppers are being told to cook ground beef all the way through, to an internal temperature of 160F.

Cooking advice: Although no illnesses have been reported, shoppers are advised to thoroughly cook beef

A spokesman for the National Beef Packing company said: 'This recall is voluntary, and there have been no reported illnesses related to the recall.'

'We are ... contacting our customers who have purchased this product.'

The meat that has been recalled include 10lb packages of National Beef 80/20 Coarse Ground Chuck, package code 0481; 10lb packages of National Beef 81/19 Coarse Ground Beef, package code 0421”;and 10lb packages of National Beef 80/20 Fine Ground Chuck, package code 0484.
