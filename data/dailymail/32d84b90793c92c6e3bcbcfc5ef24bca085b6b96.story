Showing off their shoulders in strapless frocks and revealing acres of leg in their micro skirts, the ladies of York proved that they are more than a match for the chilly northern weather today.

Despite the odd downpour and the mercury barely touching 13 degrees, racegoers arriving for Ladies Day at York Races had pulled out all the stops as they went for a win in the style stakes - goose bumps or not.

But while the short skirts and strappy tops might have proved less than practical, the gorgeous array of hats bedecked with silk blooms and ribbons on show certainly helped to brighten things up.

Hats you win: The vogue for elaborate hats has spread beyond the borders of Berkshire and proved just as popular with racegoers at York as it did at Ascot

York is currently hosting the Yorkshire Ebor Festival, one of the biggest events on the racing calendar, which attracts vast amounts of prize money and some of the best horses, jockeys and trainers in the world.

Like its southern counterparts Ascot, Cheltenham and Goodwood, the meet also includes a Ladies Day with a top prize of a short break for two in the Emirati city of Dubai for the best dressed racegoer.

As a result, the local ladies pulled out all the stops, with colourful shift dresses in summery apricot, peach and crimson, and sky high platform heels among the most popular choices.

Others opted for short and sweet ensembles, with one lady plumping for a bright pink dress cut daringly low at the front and accessorised with a pair of bright white platform shoes.

But while goose bumps were the accessory most frequently spotted, beautiful hats weren't far behind with top titfers bedecked with glamorous silk roses and impressively large plumes in evidence.

Although racegoers watching from the paddock aren't required to follow a set dress code, those enjoying the races from the County Stand are encouraged to dress up by race organisers.

Like the Ascot style police, those at York say that gentlemen should wear 'a jacket, collared shirt and tie' and complete the look with 'smart trousers and formal shoes'.

Ladies, meanwhile, are only advised to avoid jeans and trainers, although organisers do warn that 'common sense restrictions' and 'taste and decency' apply to all areas of the racecourse.

With none falling foul of York's style police, racegoers had plenty of time to devote to watching the action while doing their best to keep warm and dodge lurking showers.

On the course, highlights included the Pinsent Masons Lowther Stakes, which was taken by Irish filly Tiggy Wiggy, and the Clipper Logistics Handicap, the favourite for which was Russian Realm, a horse educated by the Queen's trainer, Sir Michael Stoute.

Aintree might have the world's biggest race in the shape of the Grand National but York is just as prestigious and like its Liverpudlian competitor, has plenty to offer in the style stakes.

Both Aintree and York offer relatively relaxed dress codes compared to Ascot, which has become famous in recent years for its exhaustively detailed style guides, and Cheltenham.

As at Aintree, York is a hotbed of northern glamour with short skirts and sky high heels regularly spotted in and around the paddock. Colourful hats are a more recent innovation, although as today's event demonstrates, the ladies of York know a thing or two when it comes to buying hats.

Indeed, with the majority of ladies arriving dressed to kill, organisers have decided it is male racegoers who require a bigger nudge, with most of the rules in the brief style guide applying to them

'Racegoers at York like to make it a 
special occasion and choose to dress accordingly,' it reads. 'Gentlemen are required
 to wear a jacket, collared shirt and tie in County Stand. Most 
gentlemen would choose to wear smart trousers and formal shoes to 
complete the look.

'So whilst there is no formal restriction on wearing 
jeans and trainers, these are rarely seen in the County Stand. In a 
similar vein, whilst we encourage a sense of style in the County Stand, 
if gentlemen believe the weather warrants shorts then there is no formal
 restriction to them being worn.

'In Grandstand and Paddock and 
Course Enclosure the dress code is more relaxed - shorts and t-shirts are
 worn by racegoers enjoyingÂ  the sun. The only common sense restrictions
 would be those of taste and decency which would apply to all areas, for
 example regarding style and slogan t-shirts. Bare chests are not 
acceptable.'

Dressed for the weather: While the majority of racegoers opted for delicate ensembles that looked rather cold, others came prepared in warm coats and jumpers
