A British jihadist fighting for ISIS in the Middle East has revealed he hopes to be given the opportunity to murder a Western hostage 'as a brother did with James Foley'.

Speaking via video link from an unknown location likely to be somewhere in northern Syria, a man calling himself Abu Anwar Al-Brittani told CNN that he would be 'honoured' to become an executioner for ISIS, adding that he considered Foley's murder a 'blessed act'.

Foley - an American photojournalist captured in Syria in 2012 - was filmed being  beheaded by an Islamist militant with a southern English accent in a sickening  video released last week.

In a clear sign that footage of Foley's brutal death is being used to further radicalise jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq, Abu Anwar said he now also hopes to be 'given the chance' to execute Westerners.

Speaking exclusively to CNN's Atika Shubert, the British militant said: 'I would be more than honoured to partake in an execution like this. I hope God gives me the chance to do such a thing as the brother did with James Foley.'

When asked who his desire to execute extended to, Abu Anwar replied: 'Whether it be on someone like James Foley, or a soldier of Bashar [al-Assad], or a soldier of America, my hands are ready to do this blessed act.'

Abu Anwar is one of an estimated 500 British Muslims believed to have travelled to the Middle East to fight for ISIS - roughly the same amount currently enlisted in Britain's army.

Abu Anwar appeared in the video alongside fellow British jihadist Abu Bakr al-Brittani.

Debate: CNN also spoke to the radical preacher Anjem Choudry (right in white shirt), whose banned East London based group al-Muhajiroun has previously been called a 'gateway to terrorism' for British Muslims

In a chilling statement, Abu Bakr threatened to return to Britain and wage jihad there if he is ever unable to stay with ISIS, which rebranded as the Islamic State after declaring itself a Caliphate.

Asked what would happen if the U.S. defeated the Islamic State, Abu Bakr said: 'If there’s no other chance than to come back…then I’ll have to do that…I’m ready to take that step to come back if your armies, if your countries don’t stop attacking us [ISIS].'

When asked what he felt about the Muslim Council of Britain condemning Foley's murder, Abu Anwar told Shubert that he considers those working for the organisation traitors to the Islamic faith.

'The Muslim Council of Britain, they are apostates, they are not Muslims. They have always fought against Islam with the British government,' he said.

'They’ve tried to stop young men going to Afghanistan, Iraq, Sria and they work in these so-called anti-extremism projects. They are not Muslims,' he added.

CNN also spoke to the radical preacher Anjem Choudry, whose banned East London based group al-Muhajiroun has previously been called a 'gateway to terrorism' for many young British Muslims. 

Speaking with Nick Paton Walsh, Choudry and four of his current band of followers refused to condemn the brutal murder of Foley - with one simply making the bizarre statement that he would  rather have his own head cut off than be sent to U.S. prison Guantanamo Bay.

Identifying himself only as Zakariyah, the  man said that Foley - who before his beheading was held hostage by militants for two years simply for  covering the Syrian conflict as a journalist  - would have had a greater understanding of his incarceration than the suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.

Describing ISIS not as terrorists but as a Utopia, one of the men said he 'would absolutely love to' leave Britain and join the Islamic State in Syria, but  fears being arrested if he tried to do so.

Listing his excuses for not leaving 'police state' Britain, the man calling himself Abu Baraa added that he was concerned his relatives would be rounded up if he tried to leave the country and join the brutal Islamist group, arguing: 'But what is wrong with going there to live under Islam?'.

Choudry goes on to say that he believes the territory under the control of ISIS will spread to Europe and the U.S. 'within decades'.
