The Rock has hinted on Instagram that he is a Liverpool fan by taking time out to pose alongside a 'You'll Never Walk Alone' artwork.

WWE legend The Rock, real name Dwayne Johnson, knows all about Liverpool having spent time there filming scenes for Fast and the Furious 6.

And it appears the wrestler turned film star may have taken a likeness for the red side of Liverpool away with him as he returned to America.

The Rock clearly knows his stuff as he gives his followers a brief history on the famous song

He clearly knows his stuff as alongside the message he wrote: ‘You'll never Rock alone, I mean walk alone.

‘Amazing history about this song written in 1945 as a show tune for the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical Carousel.

‘Then adopted in the 1960's by Liverpool Football Club and today one of the most incredibly moving anthems you'll ever hear (and see) sung by the stadium masses.'

However, it is not known whether The Rock watched Sunday’s defeat to Manchester United, but if he did it would surely have left him feeling ‘rock bottom’.
