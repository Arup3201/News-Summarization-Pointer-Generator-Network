From their perch 200 miles (320km) above Earth, astronauts have sent thousands of incredible images of our planet glittering with lights.

But what we usually don’t see is the high-tech ‘office’ within the ISS from which these stunning photos are captured.

Now Nasa has released a spectacular image of the Cupola – a module that provides panoramic views of Earth and houses one of the space station's two robotic work stations.

This image of the interior view from the International Space Station's Cupola module was taken on January 4. The large bay windows allows the Expedition 42 crew to see outside. The Cupola houses one of the space station's two robotic work stations used by astronauts to manipulate the large robotic arm seen through the right window

These robotic work stations are used by astronauts to manipulate the large robotic arm seen through the right window.

The robotic arm, or Canadarm2, was used throughout the construction of the station and is still used to grapple visiting cargo vehicles and assist astronauts during spacewalks.

The image, taken on January 4th, shows the Cupola’s large bay windows which allow the Expedition 42 crew to see outside, providing them with a full panoramic view of Earth.

It is a pressurised observation and work area that accommodates command and control workstations and other hardware.

Most images on the ISS are taken in the cupola, where there are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses. At times, astronauts compete with each other for the best position

At any time, crew members in the Cupola can communicate with other crew members, either in another part of the station or outside during spacewalk activities.

Don Pettit, one of Nasa's most prolific astronaut photographers, has spent large amounts of his time in the Cupola, trying to get the best shot of Earth.

There are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses. At times, astronauts compete with each other for the best position.

'Say a volcano's going off,' said Pettit. 'Maybe one crewmate has a 400mm, maybe one has a midrange 85-180mm lens.

'And then someone's shooting with a wide-angle lens. We're all shooting at the same subject at the same time in this rather small space.'

'You want to take pictures and share them freely with anybody who's willing to look at your photography. And that, to me, is more of a compliment than anything else,’ he added.

Don Pettit shot this time-lapse photo while aboard the International Space Station in 2012. Astronauts on the ISS are asked to take pictures of Earth and its surrounding, providing a scientific data set that has been recorded now for over 14 years
