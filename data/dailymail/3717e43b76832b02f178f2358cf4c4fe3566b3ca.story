Charged: David Renz allegedly stabbed a mother to death as she tried to attack him after he raped her 10-year-old daughter

A pedophile who raped a ten-year-old girl before stabbing her mother to death after he cut off his electronic monitoring bracelet pleaded guilty today to murder and sex charges.

David Renz, 29, from New York, admitted in county court that he carjacked the two on March 14, stabbing and strangling the mother to death as she tried to stop him from raping her daughter.

Renz had been under federal monitoring after a child pornography charge and a federal judge was sharply critical of the way probation officers failed to keep track of him.

Renz, 29, pleaded guilty to state charges of first-degree murder and sexual assault against a child.

He was expected to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but the plea bargain can be withdrawn if the federal government seeks the death penalty.

His lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Authorities say Renz attacked the woman, a school librarian, and her daughter after they left a gymnastics class at a mall in the Syracuse suburb of Clay.

Police said he used an air pistol to force the woman to drive he car to a remote section of the mall's parking lot, where he bound both of them and raped the girl.

Prosecutors say Renz was trying to 
use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she 
fought back and shouted for the girl to bolt from the vehicle.

As the girl ran off and was rescued 
by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed 
in the head and chest, officials said. Renz was captured by police 
shortly after.

The woman has not been identified to protect the identity of the girl.

Hours before the attack, Renz removed
and quickly reassembled an electronic bracelet so monitors didn't 
immediately realize he'd taken it off, authorities said.

He was ordered to wear the device as a
condition for being released from jail after his arrest in January on 
federal child pornography charges.

Weeks after the attack, a report by a
federal judge found that the officers failed to do monthly checks on 
Renz that would have included inspection of the bracelet. Federal 
probation officers Syracuse who were monitoring Renz were fired or 
demoted.

Onondaga County District Attorney 
William Fitzpatrick said some child porn Renz possessed included scenes 
similar to the attack on the mother and child.

After
stopping the car, Renz ordered the woman to drive to a remote part of 
the parking lot where he bound both victims' hands with cable ties and 
raped the child, Fitzpatrick said.

Renz
then drove them a short distance until the car got stuck in a snow 
bank, prosecutors said. It was there, they said, that he tried to 
restrain the mother and the child escaped, looking back to see her 
mother had gotten out of the car and was being chased by Renz.

A
passing motorist found the girl and alerted police who caught Renz 
nearby after a foot chase. Fitzpatrick said Renz had the woman's car 
keys and blood on his clothes matched that of the child.

A federal grand jury indicted him earlier this year on one count of receiving and five counts of possessing child pornography.

An FBI investigation led to the charges that he downloaded the pornography featuring young girls over the course of two years and had five DVDs and CDs, according to the indictment.
