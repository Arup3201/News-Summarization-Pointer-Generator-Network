Diego Costa is the real deal as a striker. His attributes look tailor-made for English football.

He has a bit of everything about him. He is great at holding the ball up, has enough speed to get in behind defenders, can work the 18-yard box and is clearly not going to be intimidated by physical opponents.

Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea City last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt 

I would put his former Atletico team-mate, Radamel Falcao, just ahead of him overall but he still looks like the missing link for Chelsea. They — as Atletico before them — have worked out how to play in the way that suits him best, which Spain, with their short intricate passing, didn’t manage in the World Cup.

Together with Cesc Fabregas, he has formed a wonderful understanding and Chelsea look a better side than last season — and that’s after having made a profit of transfers in the summer.

Fabregas looks to be the perfect replacement for Frank Lampard. He might not score as many but he will create more.

I would imagine he’ll play just behind Costa at Manchester City on Sunday, with Ramires and Nemanja Matic sitting in the deeper positions to add a bit more solidity.

You might have thought it would take Chelsea three or four months for their new signings to settle in but Costa, Fabregas and Thibaut Courtois have adapted straight away, which is why I have them as title favourites.

They don’t need to win on Sunday; a draw would do them fine. Jose Mourinho always said that this was the season on which we should judge him and, so far, that’s looking like a good call.
