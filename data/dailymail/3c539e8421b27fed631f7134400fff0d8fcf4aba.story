Officials say New York Gov Andrew Cuomo's father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, has been hospitalized.

The governor's office says Saturday the elder Cuomo is being treated for a heart condition.

A gubernatorial spokeswoman says the 82-year-old former three-term governor is in good spirits and is thankful for the best wishes and support he's received.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo also spent the Thanksgiving Day holiday at the hospital with his father.

Mario Cuomo's condition and details on his heart condition weren't disclosed. 

The spokeswoman says more updates will be provided 'as appropriate.'

The Daily News first reported the ex-governor's hospitalization.

The elder Cuomo was in office from 1983 to 1994, serving three terms. He was defeated in his fourth term and subsequently retired from politics. 

One of his stand out moments was at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, California, where he attacked President Reagan. 

He was in the running to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988 and 1992, but declined both times. 

The New York Times reported that he looked frail attending his son's re-election party on November 4.

During the event, Andrew said his father was the father of the modern Democratic Party, a man who is all about principle and inspiration
