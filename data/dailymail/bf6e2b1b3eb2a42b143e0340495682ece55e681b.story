An Ohio man who says he is the keeper of the seal of St. Peter and immune from U.S. law has been ordered held without bond on charges that he issued hundreds of fraudulent diplomatic credentials to people who paid to be part of his movement.

Sixty-year-old James T. McBride was denied bond Wednesday at a hearing in federal court in Alexandria.
