'But for now I have my mind set on defending this shirt with all the professionalism.

'I can not say a league or team in particular. There is much speculation and rumours always come around my transfer.To tell you the truth, I do not know which teams are asking for my services because I ask my agent not talk to me about these possibilities, because I need to focus on Porto.

'Come the summer I will find my way out. England, Italy? Maybe, but for now I do not know.'
