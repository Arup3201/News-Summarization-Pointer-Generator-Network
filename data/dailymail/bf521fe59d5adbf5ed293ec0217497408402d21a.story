The castaway who claims he was lost at sea for thirteen months will provide 'proof' that he really did survive for so long on a small boat cast adrift on the Pacific Ocean.

Jose Salvador Alvarenga is planning to hold a press conference Friday to hit back at skeptics who have doubted that his extraordinary survival story is genuine.

'There is nothing funny about the 
ordeal Jose faced', said Jeff Masonek, head of Masonek Law Offices - 
which has offices in Santa Ana, California, Argentina and El Salvador - which is representing the survivor.

'Proof': Alvarenga will reveal that he has medical tests done that show his condition is consistent with that of someone who has gone through the ordeal he describes

Skeptics: Many have cast doubt on his extraordinary tale. Alvarenga claims to have drifted more than 5,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean for 13 months on this tiny fishing boat, eating raw turtle and drinking his own urine to stay alive

'A young man died beside him in that
 boat and Jose had to reach down to the very depths of his being to stay
 alive against almost insurmountable odds.

'To anybody who knows Jose, any suggestion that he is exaggerating is just absurd and an unfair slur on his reputation.'

The engine on Alvarenga’s 26-foot fiberglass boat gave out on his way home from a routine two-day shark-fishing trip on the Mexican coast in December 2012.

Incredibly, the hardy 37-year-old fisherman kept alive eating birds and turtles to wash up 6,700 miles away on a remote coral atoll in the Marshall Islands more than a year later.

But he has faced a barrage of skepticism since being discovered naked and close to death after finally reaching land on January 30 this year.

At Friday's press conference in San Salvador, the capital of his native El Salvador, doctors and a psychologist are expected to explain how the fisherman’s physical and mental health is consistent with a man who endured such a marathon ordeal at sea.

His lawyers say they will also reveal 
the results of a lie detector test that Alvarenga volunteered to take to
 prove once and for all that he is telling the truth.

Alvarenga,
 who is hoping to strike a book and movie deal for his story, is said to
 be 'devastated' at claims that he has been lying to his family and to 
the world since he made it to safety.

He
 said his fishing companion, Ezequiel Cordova, 21, lived four months in 
the boat with him before succumbing to starvation and exposure.

'Slurs': The fisherman, seen here on his return to El Salvador, reached 'down to the very depths of his being' to survive, his lawyer said. He added that 'there is nothing funny about his ordeal' and any suggestions of exaggeration are 'absurd'

The castaway, now reunited with his family, has denied cruel claims that he resorted to cannibalism to survive and was particularly upset over a TV spoof mocking his story.

Alvarenga, who is struggling with health problems as a result of the journey, has told how his faith helped him believe that he would one day be found as his boat was carried by storms and currents across the ocean.

He ate raw birds and fish and drank his own urine to survive.

Alvarenga has yet to talk in any detail about his unique ordeal. 'We already have a large number of offers from people interested in telling Jose’s story,' said Masonek. 'But at the moment, he is more interested in focusing on regaining his health and in the world understanding that he has been telling the truth.'
