Members of Tottenham’s squad have spread the festive cheer, attending several children’s wards at local hospitals.

A host of the first-team squad met the patients, handing out presents and posing for photos.

The squad were taking time out before travelling for their Europa League tie at Besiktas on Thursday, having already qualified for the knockout stages.

Jenna Schillaci of Tottenham Ladies was then joined by Mousa Dembele, Benji Stambouli and Jan Vertonghen at North Middlesex Hospital on Tuesday afternoon.
