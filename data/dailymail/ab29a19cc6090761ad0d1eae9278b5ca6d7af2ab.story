The most brutal political ad of the 2012 election has blown up in the Obama campaign's face after blatant deceptions were revealed in the story of a woman who died of cancer following the closure of a steel mill owned by Mitt Romney's venture capital firm.

Joe Soptic, who has appeared in an anti-Romney ad before, links the loss of his job and health benefits at a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, to his wife Ilyona succumbing to stage four cancer in the new commercial titled 'Understands.' Mr Soptic says Romney doesn't know what his private equity firm did to workers, 'and further, I don't think he's concerned.'

However, it has come to light that Mrs Soptic had her own health insurance from her employer for years after her husband was laid off.

Furthermore, the plant closed in 2001 - when Romney was no longer involved in the daily operation of the company - and Mrs Soptic died five years later in 2006.

Shocking: Laid-off steel worker Joe Soptic blames Mitt Romney for his wife's cancer death after Bain Capital shut down the mill where he worked

Even nonpartisan observers are shocked at the half-truths and omissions in the ad, though the Obama campaign has refused to distance itself from the story.

CNN says the ad is 'not accurate.' The Washington Post's Fact Checker gave the commercial 'four Pinoccios,' the lowest possible truth rating, calling it a 'whopper' of a lie.

The commercial was released on Tuesday by Priorities USA 
Action, the super PAC supporting the president's reelection campaign. The president can officially disavow the attack by saying it was produced by an 
independent group, but the PAC is run by two former White House aides 
and other close allies.

Point-by-point, the one minute advert's omissions and deceptions:

Dispute: Romney's experience at Bain Capital has been a source of exhaustive attacks by the Obama campaign in an effort to discredit the Republican challenger

The story centers around Mr Soptic, a 62-year-old lifelong Democrat and union supporter, who worked at GST Steel in Kansas City for more than 20 years.

He has come forward as a political partisan and the Obama campaign has tried to make him the face of the white working-class Midwesterner who was a victim of Romney's 'vulture capitalism.'

This is the second attack ad against Bain that has given Mr Soptic a starring role. He was first seen in a video about the closure of his steel plant that was released in May.

However brutal Mr Soptic's claims are, the facts tell a different story.

Romney did not close the steel mill

Mr Soptic, though, blames the plant closure directly on the presumptive Republican nominee.

'I don't think Mitt Romney knows what he
 has done to people's lives by closing the plant. I don't think he 
realizes that people's lives have completely changed,' he says in the 
ad.

In 1999, Romney left Bain Capital to run the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. He was no longer at the company when GS Industries went bankrupt in 2001 in the face of mounting losses.

He formally left Bain for good in 2002.

When Mrs Soptic died in 2006, Romney was governor of Massachusetts and hadn't been in charge of Bain for seven years.

Bain Capital's investment did not shut down GST Steel

'Mitt Romney and Bain Capital made millions for themselves and then closed this steel plant,' a dramatic headline in the ad reads.

The real story is much more complex.

Bain Capital was one of several investors that paid $80million to buy the plant from Armco in 1993.

At the time it was struggling. Armco lost $640million that year. The American steel industry was in the midst of massive shutdowns and struggles as they lost ground to cheaper foreign imports, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Bain folded the Kansas City plant, GST Steel, into a company called GS Industries, which made $1billion in revenues by 1996.

Controversy: Many of the campaign volleys have centered around whether Bain created more jobs than it destroyed

GST Steel in Kansas City closed, laying off 750 workers including Mr Soptic. It was the only plant in GS Industries that was forced to shut down as a result of the bankruptcy reorganization, the Journal reports.

Mrs Soptic did not lose her healthcare because her husband lost his job

'When Mitt Romney and Bain closed the plant, I lost my healthcare. And my family lost their healthcare,' Mr Soptic states in the video.

But that's not true, he admits.

At the time he lost his job, Mr Soptic was earning about $41,000 a year. Mrs Soptic also had a job working at a local thrift store that gave her health insurance, CNN reports.

She kept the job, and the health benefits, until she was forced to quit in 2003 after an injury.

Mrs Soptic died five years after the plant shut down

Here's how the ad plays the timeline: Mr Soptic describes losing his health insurance as a result of the plant closure.

'A short time after that, my wife became ill,' he says.

However, it was not until 2006 -- five years after the plant closed -- that this happened, Mr Soptic has admitted.

'I
 don’t know how long she was sick, and I think maybe she didn’t say 
anything because she knew that we couldn’t afford the insurance,' he 
says in the ad.

Symbol: Joe Soptic has become the face of the Midwestern working-class 'victim' of Bain Capital -- but his story isn't what it seems

The cancer was stage four by the time she went to the hospital. She died 22 days later.

Nonetheless, Mr Soptic still manages to blame Romney for his wife's death.

Mr Soptic ends the ad by saying: 'I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he’s done to anyone, and furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.'

The story doesn't end there for Mr Soptic. The Washington Post reveals that his income is back to $46,000 a year -- the same he was making at the mill -- thanks to his pension from the company and his salary as a janitor.

He has also re-married. He and his high school sweetheart wed four years after Mrs Soptic died of cancer.

Romney's campaign blasted the new spot as 'discredited, dishonest attacks.' A spokesman says Obama is trying to distract the American people from the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates.

The Priorities USA Action PAC, which supports Obama's campaign, has raised $20.7million as of June 30 and spent more than $17million -- all on ads attacking Romney.

Restore Our Future, Romney's super PAC run by two former aides, has raised $62million and spent $8.2million opposing Obama so far. It also spent nearly $40million bashing Romney's Republican primary challengers and $14million support the former Massachusetts governor.
