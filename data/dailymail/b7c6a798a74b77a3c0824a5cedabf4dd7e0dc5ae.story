Since his shameful fall from grace after making anti-Semitic comments, John Galliano has been trying to make amends to re-build his career.

But while his recent Paris catwalk show and collaboration with Oscar de la Renta both met with rave reviews, it seems his own wardrobe leaves something to be desired.

The British designer, 52, was pictured meeting former model and creative director of American Vogue magazine, Grace Coddington, yesterday wearing a number of crimes against fashion.

Time for cricket? The designer met Grace Coddington for lunch wearing his unusual outfit

Perhaps in a nod to his heritage, he teamed a cricket jumper with tasseled tartan shorts resembling a picnic blanket. This was worn over a longer pair of camouflage shorts accompanied by green socks pulled up to his knees, worn under sandals.

He also wore a scruffy khaki jacket and a baggy beanie with pink sunglasses as he stepped out in West Village, New York.

Meanwhile flame-haired  Ms Coddington looked a far cry from the glamorous model who once graced the cover of Vogue. The Welsh-born 72-year-old wore baggy black trousers and a jacket with a white shirt. She further dressed down her look with plimsolls and a plain leather shoulder bag.

Is the catwalk ready for this look? Galliano has been planning his return to fashion following his fall from grace in 2011

Change in style: Galliano taking to the catwalk for Dior in 2010

The pair have been spotted dining together on a number of occasions recently as Galliano plots his return to the world of fashion after he was sacked from Dior in 2011.

Ms Coddington had hinted at Galliano's return during an interview with Vogue at the end of 2012.

'I love John, I think he's brilliant,' she said. 'He certainly intends to come back - when he's ready. I hope he will return, but I don't know. That's a tough one to get over.' 

Galliano has endeavoured to make amends for his previous behaviour with his publicist Liz Rosenberg stating in Feburary: 'Mr Galliano continues to be committed to making amends and seeking forgiveness from the Jewish community for his insensitive remarks two years ago.'

Meanwhile the designer blamed an addiction to alcohol on his indiscretions in an interview with WWD in January: 'I am an alcoholic. I have been in recovery for the past two years... I remain committed to making amends to those I have hurt,' he said. 'Several years prior to my sobriety, I descended into the madness of the disease. I said and did things which hurt others, especially members of the Jewish community. I have expressed my sorrow privately and publicly for the pain which I caused, and I continue to do so.'

It was confirmed last month that he will teach a masterclass at New York's top fashion college, Parsons The New School For Design, this year called 'show me emotion' divided into three day-long workshops.
