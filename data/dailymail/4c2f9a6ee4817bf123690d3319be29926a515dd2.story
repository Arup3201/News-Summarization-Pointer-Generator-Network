The model, who accused married actor Brain Presley of pathetically trying to chat her up on a plane in a lengthy, and humiliating, live Twitter feed, seems to have a history of stretching the truth.

As the 34-year-old actor denies the encounter ever took place, model Melissa Stetten, 28, appears to have a prolific history of lying.

On her blog Pretty Bored, she admits to telling large fibs at least twice in the past three months, and reveals she took the drug Zoloft earlier this year as an anti-depressant.

On March 30, the model posted a Photoshopped picture of two Mega Millions 'winning' tickets to her Twitter page.

Its caption read: 'I think I just won a billion dollars'. Some suggested it was an April Fools' prank.

On March 7, she also admitted on her blog that she often lies about her age.

The post reads: '[Casting directors] ask my age, I say 23, as usual, because if I went any younger I fear that they might question the miniscule eye wrinkle'.

The blog also features posts that discuss her miscarriage, her rocky relationship with Anthony Cumia, a 51-year-old radio host, and her fondness for Matthew McConaughey, despite a later post that reads: 'If you find Matthew McConaughey attracttive I probably hate you because I hate him'.

Andy Levy, who hosts the Halftime Report segment on Fox's late night show Red-Eye, also questioned her claims.

Red-Eye's regular news discussion panel debated the model's alleged conversation with Mr Levy last night, questioning her claims against the actor.

Bernie McGuirk said: 'She was up to something...this is what she alleges. It smells rotten, the whole thing.'

Miss Stetten live-tweeted a conversation two days 
ago with actor Brian Presley, from Oklahoma, who allegedly told her 
that he believed they were 'brought together' by God on the domestic 
flight.

The model alleged Mr Presley drank 'three Heinekens' on the Los Angeles flight to New York, even
though he has previously spoken of his attendance at 'weekly AA 
meetings with a group of awesome, godly men from my church.'

However today, after the story of their alleged encounter went worldwide, he responded to the allegations on his Facebook page - calling them 'absurd, funny' and stating that 'none of this happened.'

In a long post, Mr Presley responded:
'I love that I took a red eye flight to NY, had a 10 minute friendly 
conversation with the person sitting next to me, had some food, and went
to sleep!

'I learned today this person has been
tweeting about me drinking beer in the airplane bathroom, and trying to
commit adultery with her on the airplane. Really absurd and quite 
funny! ... They Even took pictures of me while I was sleeping.

A little WIERD [sic]! I was on a soap opera for years and never did the writers write something this good:)

'None of what this person said happened is true! I guess in today's age you have to be careful who you say hello too.'

And in reference to claims that he was drinking, Mr Presley concluded: 'Sobriety, God, & My Family are the most important things in my life! My Wife Rocks, My Kids Rock, and Sobriety Rocks!!! I will pay this no more attention and I encourage all of you to do the same. God Bless all of you and thank you all for all your support!'

The amused model tweeted Mr Presley's Facebook post and wrote: 'Now THIS is funny...'

The model had detailed the alleged encounter with Mr Presley in a series of amusing Twitter posts.

She had claimed that she did not recognise him at first.

And it was only when one of her 13,000 followers alerted her to his identity that the messages became more interesting.

The actor, a former star of Port Charles which was a 
spin-off TV series of General Hospital, has previously spoken publicly about his journey to sobriety and religion.

Miss Stetten tweeted: 'Brian just said "like us sitting here right now, talking about 
where we're from, it's like divine interception". right, interception.'

'No
thanks, Brian, the actor sitting next to me on this flight talking 
about his role with Kurt Russell and his spiritual beliefs.'

During the pair's alleged conversation, he claimed that he is not married to his wife of ten years Erin Hershey Presley.

He, in fact, met Mrs Presley on the 
show's set - the pair were co-stars and now have two children.

The model posted at a later stage of the
commentary: 'He said he was engaged for 6 months but broke it off! RT 
@Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Ask him how his wife Erin and son Jackson 
are.'

Charmer: She tweeted that her took off his wedding ring - the tweet was later deleted

A now-deleted tweet also read: 'Holy s**t Brian came back from the bathroom WITHOUT his wedding ring on! Watch out Virgin America, you've got a real charmer on board.'

The model, born in Kalamazoo, 
Michigan, posted her detailed description as he chatted to her from the 
seat beside her on the flight.

She
expressed an unwillingness to engage in the conversation right from her
first tweet, but it seems that the actor, who has 
appeared in guest roles in Beverly Hills 90210 and 7th Heaven in the 
past, couldn't take the hint.

Through her tweets, her Twitter 
followers learned that 'Brian... is an artist and believes everything 
happens for a reason like how we're brought together on this flight'.

He is also 'a straightforward guy who booked a McDonalds commercial when he was 19 and then God took over from there'.

The actor, who starred in a movie called Touchback, told the model further lies about his marital status.

Soon enough, Miss Stetten's followers, which now total almost 18,700, began posting actual facts about the actor.

The model then acknowledged the possible repercussions of her running commentary.

She posted: 'Did I just ruin Brian Presley's life via Twitter?'
