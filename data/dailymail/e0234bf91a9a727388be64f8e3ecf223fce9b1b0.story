Copper thieves have struck twice in three days – at a police station.

Officers are appealing for information from the public after a new £12.5million custody suite had piping stolen this month.

The crooks stole it from the unfinished building beside Gloucestershire Police’s HQ in Gloucester.

The thefts occurred between August 15 and 16 and August 19 and 20 from the block which is designed to help police spend more time on the beat by cutting admission times.

‘The building is still in the hands of the contractor and not yet handed over to Gloucestershire Police,’ said a constabulary spokesman.

‘At no point was any sensitive information at risk since the building is still not in use. The cost of the loss will be borne by the contractor.’

The suite is designed to house 50 suspects and will open this winter.
