Council workers in Switzerland were astonished to find more than £80,000 in gold bars hidden in a bush.

The gardeners were cutting grass verges in the northern town of Klingau, near the Swiss border with Germany, when they stumbled on a package containing ten gold ingots.

It looked like the bars had been deliberately hidden in the undergrowth, they said.

Under Swiss law, if nobody comes forward to legitimately claim ownership of the gold, then the council employees can keep it all.

Jackpot: Council workers in Switzerland were astonished to find more than £80,000 in gold bars hidden in a bush in a town near the Swiss-German border

Jean-Marc Wenger, who lives in Klingau, found the gold.

He said: 'I saw a package wrapped in white tissue
paper, with lots of adhesive tape around it. It looked like a packet of
drugs.

'I opened the mysterious package and 
couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the gold bars. We handed it in to 
police, but I have not heard anything since.'

As the town is located near the Swiss-German border, police suspect the gold may have been involved in some kind of criminal pay-off that went wrong.

Each gold bar weighed between 50g and 100g and in total weighed in at 2.5kg.

The bars have no markings so it is difficult to trace where it come from.

Police spokesman Bernhard Graser said: 'It's gold all right, the ingots have been tested. I've never known anything like it.

'We are trying to find the owners of the gold and where it came from. But at the moment it is a complete mystery.

'We do not have any reports of any gold thefts nor has anyone reported the gold as missing.'

Swiss media has reported that a search of the area uncovered a hole which had been dug near where the gold was found.
