A pair of Hindu deities bought for pennies at a street market in Tibet and kept hidden under a desk because 'they were too nice to use as doorstops' have sold for a staggering £113,000 at auction.

One of the statues sold for more than 1,000 times its asking price fetching £90,000 when it went up for sale.

The 300-year-old gilt bronze statue was part of a pair picked up by a British collector years ago. He left them to his nephew when he passed away.

Unaware of their mammoth value, he kept them under his desk until a clear-out prompted him to sell them because 'they were too nice to use as doorstops'.

This 300-year-old deity of the Hindu god Shiva was valued at £80 to £120 after being bought for 'pennies' at a Tibetan market. Staff at British Bespoke Auctions were shocked when it sold for £90,000 to a Chinese collector

Auctioneers British Bespoke Auctions put an £80 estimate on the pearl-set figure of supreme god Lord Shiva, hoping the 26cm statue might fetch £120.

But they were astonished when an international bidding war saw the rare figure go to a Chinese collector for £90,000 - 1,135 times its asking price.

The smaller statue was also snapped up for £23,000 - excelling its £60 estimate.

Nicholas Granger, owner of the Cotswold’s auction house in Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire, said: 'They really were the most amazing two items we’ve ever had in six years of having the auction room.

'They are thought to be up to 300 years old and they were very difficult to value. It just shows the power of the internet.

'As soon as we put them up there we had interest from all over the world. We had ten different buyers on the phone as well as all the interest in the room.

'Making the vendors aware of the outcome was a very special moment. I made sure they were sitting down first.'

The larger statue - set with pearls, emeralds and coral - was valued at between £80 and £120, when it came in from a couple in Winchcombe.

The smaller 18cm deity, decorated with similar jewels, was valued at just £60 to £80, and it is thought the heavy pair were once used in a Tibetan Hindu temple.

Speaking of the initial buyer, Nicholas said: 'He was just a general collector. He would go round stalls in Tibet, just picking up bits he would like.

A smaller statue, measuring 18cm - also bought at a street market in Tibet for 'pennies' - sold for £23,000 despite being valued at £60 to £80

'It would have cost him pounds, just a few pounds, or even pennies. The gentleman left it to his nephew and it was sat under his desk for quite a few years.

'They were doing a clear out and they thought ‘these are a bit nice to have a doorstop’ so brought them along to the local auction house.'

The most expensive of the pair had already attracted initial bids on the books for around £5,000, but pledges in the room on Thursday saw it quickly climb to £15,000.

But action turned to the phones with bidders increasing their offers by up to £10,000 at a time.

'It just went up and up and up,' said Nicholas. 'It was going from the room to the phones to the room to the phones.

'It was very exciting. It was nail-biting stuff. That’s what I like about this business. You never know what’s on your doorstep.'

The smaller statue went to a buyer in the room, a representative of a collector.

Nicholas defended his small auction house but admitted the estimates were 'very low'.

'We’re very very realistic with our estimates here,' he said. 'We like to put low estimates to attract attention. We find it works. But yes, this was very low.

'If we had put £15,000 or £20,000 on them it might not have gone for so much. We aren’t Sotheby’s or Christie’s. Buyers like provincial auction rooms.

'Most of them [Hindu diety statues] are about 13cms, so I think it was the size of these ones that made them so special.'
