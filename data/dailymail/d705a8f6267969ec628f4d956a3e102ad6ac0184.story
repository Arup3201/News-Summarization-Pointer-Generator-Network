Care home staff overdosed a pensioner with sedatives because she ‘complained too much’.

Barbara Oldham, 85, was given so much promazine she could not lift her head as she sat in a chair and was unable to speak or walk.

The drug, which is used to treat severely agitated behaviour, was administered after Mrs Oldham was moved to the Bupa-run Carders Court in Castleton, near Rochdale. Staff had claimed she was disruptive with other residents.

Her son Andrew, 47, noticed his once chatty mother had become withdrawn but workers denied giving her too many tablets and said she was merely tired.

The theatre promoter later filed a complaint with Rochdale social services which found she was needlessly given the drug on a nightly basis from October 2011 to January 2012.

Mrs Oldham, who had been a department store worker, was moved to another care home and recovered from her ordeal. 

Seven months after her death in March 2014, Bupa Services agreed to pay Mr Oldham £5,000 damages in an out-of-court settlement for his medical negligence claim.

Mr Oldham said: ‘Although I’ll never be able to forget how badly my mother was treated at Carders Court, the compensation goes some way towards giving my mum the justice she deserves.

‘I had concerns about my mother’s care since she moved into Carders Court because it seemed certain staff members took a dislike to her, and I reported a number of incidents to management.

‘My mum was a lovely, bubbly character but she started to become withdrawn and appeared more sedated and drugged every time I visited her.

‘Sometimes she was asleep for the whole visit so I raised concerns with various members of staff that she appeared over-medicated but it fell on deaf ears. I became convinced that she was being given too many drugs. It is utterly disgusting the way she was treated.’

Mrs Oldham, who suffered from depression, moved to Carders Court in July 2002 after the previous care home she lived in closed down.

She was prescribed 5ml of promazine on an irregular basis which meant it was to be used at night as and when required to boost her mood, but not on a regular basis.

The dosage was dropped to 2.5ml on December 11, 2011, on the recommendation of a community psychiatric nurse.

Mr Oldham, who lives in Blackpool, added: ‘I was never happy with her treatment there and made a number of complaints.

‘I worked in social services and I knew that the treatment she was receiving wasn’t good enough.’

A social worker at Rochdale Council’s adult care services unit conducted an investigation and uncovered the overdosing. 

Staff signatures on medication administration records provided clear evidence.

Promazine was also found to be given on nights where the records show that Mrs Oldham was settled and not agitated. In the week before Christmas 2011, she was regularly given double doses.

A spokesman for the home told the Mail: 'We are sorry that Mrs Oldham’s care did not meet our usual high standards. The health and wellbeing of our residents is our absolute priority.

'This was an isolated incident that happened two years ago. The medication had been prescribed by the resident’s own doctor to be given “as required”.

‘The home has since taken action to prevent this happening again. We have introduced a new policy whereby staff must notify the resident’s GP if a resident has been given ‘as required’ (PRN) medication for five consecutive days.

‘Staff have also been given extra training to ensure that they fully document the reasons why a PRN medication has been administered. The home has remained fully compliant with CQC standards during this time.’
