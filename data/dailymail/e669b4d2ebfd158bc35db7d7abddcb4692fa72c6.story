There's a charming town in southern France, roughly 600 miles from Manchester and 400 from Madrid, where an Irish woman is living in a different kind of world to Robin van Persie and James Rodriguez.

It’s here, in Albi, where Stephanie Roche calls home these days. Or at least for the next six months, if things go well.

She’s taking a big step in this small town, moving to professional football from the Irish amateur game, where she scored the goal that lapped the planet.

Since here wonder goal, Roche has moved on to play professionally for French club ASPTT Albi

She speaks no French and all bar two of her team-mates speak no English; when the 25-year-old returns to her small apartment each night, it’s alone, away from her footballer boyfriend and family in Ireland.

But her dream for years has been to get to this level, playing full-time football in a respected league. 

James Rodriguez, Robin van Persie and Aaron Ramsey all make the cut as Sportsmail selects their top 10 best goals of 2014 

Only the best players in the French top flight can expect to earn as much as £800 a month, but for Roche, ‘it’s about loving the game, not being rich’. In that sense, the romance has never been less one-sided.

There have been almost five million YouTube hits for her goal, though Roche is more interested in the countdown to January 12, when the Puskas Award will be presented in Zurich. 

There, at the Ballon d’Or gala, she will learn if the public voted her goal the world’s best in 2013-14, ahead of Colombia’s Rodriguez and Robin van Persie of Holland.

Van Persie is her favourite player and Manchester United happen to be her favourite club. ‘I might well ask for a picture or two,’ she says. ‘I probably won’t ask for an autograph because I don’t want to look out of place.’

That much should not be in doubt — the quality of her goal puts her there on merit. But the goal’s circumstances, with 85 people and one camcorder in attendance, means she stands out to say the least.

‘Van Persie and Rodriguez scored in the World Cup, so I guess mine is a little different,’ Roche says. ‘I don’t want to sound cheeky but I think mine was the best of the three.' And what a remarkable goal it was.

The 25-second clip from October 2013 — the span for entries was October 2013 to September 2014 — is a little fuzzy. It was uploaded to YouTube by the manager of Peamount United, Eileen Gleeson, whose side were playing Wexford Youth in the Women’s National League.

There isn’t a supporter to be seen as Peamount’s Aine O’Gorman crosses from the right to Roche.

The Republic of Ireland international controls with her right, uses her left to lob her marker and then spins to volley the dropping ball from the edge of the box. From cross to net, the ball doesn’t touch the ground.

Ian Wright described it as the best he has seen, David Luiz called it ‘incredible’ and Gary Lineker said it was the goal of the season.

Roche’s first thoughts were less grand. ‘I’m a forward so I was just thinking that it was my first of the season,’ she says. ‘Then after the game the Wexford manager called me over to watch it on his laptop.

‘I thought, “OK, that’s actually quite nice”. It’s lucky it was caught on tape. You don’t get cameras there every week.’

Gleeson put the video on YouTube and for a time it never spread beyond friends and family. Then things got a little intense.

‘After about a week it wasn’t noticed,’ Roche says. ‘Then it went on a football website in Ireland, a few people shared it and then I had a tweet one morning from Soccer AM on Sky. 

It said #unbelievabletekkers so I got in front of the TV and 20 minutes later they are showing my goal. Now it has had millions of views.

‘I realised how big it was when people like Ian Wright, Matt Le Tissier and David Luiz were talking about it. Dara O’Briain, the comedian, as well.

'John Hartson went through it on TV and was really positive about my technique.

‘I’ve been asked about the goal by shows in the US, Germany, Belgium, France, Brazil, Egypt. Honestly, it’s all gone crazy.’

After the incredible surge of popularity, it was announced earlier this month that she was on the shortlist with Rodriguez and Van Persie, making her the first female player to ever reach the final three.

‘Some rubbish gets talked about women’s football so it’s been very nice that it might help change opinions,’ Roche says.

‘But the whole thing has been so much fun. To be up against Van Persie is great. My boyfriend and I go to watch United seven or eight times a year.

‘Funnily enough, my boyfriend (Dean Zambra) plays in the League of Ireland for Bray Wanderers and he was up for goal of the season there. 

He was saying, “How is your goal up for the Puskas and mine wasn’t?” It’s all been so much fun.’

Certainly it’s made the adaptation to life in France easier. Roche moved over to join ASPTT Albi on a one-year contract in June, before she was shortlisted.

Crowds are between 500 and 1,000 a game and training is five days a week rather than the two days she’d do at Peamount. When Sportsmail visits she is twice recognised by strangers on the street.

But for all her new fame and joy at full-time football, it’s not a living as Van Persie or Rodriguez would know it.

‘It’s hard out here with the language and I don’t make a lot of money,’ Roche says. ‘I am looked after with my apartment and bills but what I earn is what I live off. 

'I’ll have to make a life for myself at some point but this is about the football.

‘I wanted to test myself, to give it a go. It is what I wanted so I have no complaints about it being hard. None at all — I’m happy. This nomination makes me happier still.

‘If I actually win the thing I’ll be the happiest footballer in the world.’
