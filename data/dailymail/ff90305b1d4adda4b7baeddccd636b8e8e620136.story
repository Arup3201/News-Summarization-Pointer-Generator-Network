A Tennessee man was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault Saturday after injuring his life partner by driving with him on the hood of his 2012 Mercedes Benz, authorities say.

Michael Counce, 52, and his life partner Bobby Kelley, 33, got into an argument during dinner at a restaurant in Memphis, according to MyFoxMemphis.

Following the argument, Counce allegedly got into his silver Mercedes and backed out of a private driveway.
