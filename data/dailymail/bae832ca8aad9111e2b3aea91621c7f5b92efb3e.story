A big rig truck smashed into an Amtrak train partially derailing it and injuring at least 20 of its roughly 169 passengers hours before local emergency crews rushed to a second crash involving a truck and a freight train.

Failing to yield the railroad's crossing in California's Central Valley the driver of a big rig pushed two passenger cars and the locomotive off the tracks just south of Hanford where hours later a second occurred.

The passenger train travelled about 600 feet after the collision before hitting a switchback and derailing, according to California Patrol Officer Scott Harris.

Collision: Authorities say a big rig truck collided with the southbound train near Hanford, California after failing to yield to a road road crossing

Moments' reaction: The train travelled about 600 feet after the collision before hitting a switchback and derailing

The injuries sustained were minor to moderate including to the big rig's driver who authorities said was transporting 'cotton trash,' described as burrs, seeds and leaves taken from post-harvest cotton.

Adding to what would be described as a 'chaotic' day for emergency crews, less than four hours later at 4pm, a second crash involving a semi and a freight train occurred.

'It’s nuts,' CHP Officer Bryan Savage who was at both scenes told the Hanford Sentinel. 'At any time, this could happen.'

The second involving a silage truck transporting farm feed was approximately 17 miles north in Hanford.

Both the
operators of that freight train and semi escaped serious injuries 
according to a California Highway spokesperson.

'He’s
lucky,' Savage said of the second crash's driver. 'He basically had the
front end of his truck over the tracks. If he had been a little bit 
more forward, it would have been a lot worse.'

Rushed away: One of the train's roughly 169 passengers is seen carried away on a stretcher following the afternoon crash

Miraculous escape: The semi that was carrying cotton trash, the seeds and other debris from post-harvest cotton, is seen after the collision that left its driver with non-serious injuries

Chaos: The scene was described as a huge, chaotic scene by responding California Highway Patrol officers who managed to safely move everyone from the wreckage

Savage believes the driver misjudged the train's distance and speed with no drugs or alcohol involved.

The driver was travelling less than 15 mph and the train 20-30.

A cause for either crash has yet to be determined by the National Transportation Safety Board.

According to Kings County Assistant Sheriff Dave Putnam the first involving the Amtrak occurred at a crossing that was equipped with control gates.

The injuries to passengers were described by Putnam as bumps, bruises, scrapes and possibly broken bones.

Eight
of the injured passengers were taken to Adventist Medical Center in 
Hanford and five more were enroute, said hospital spokeswoman Christine 
Pickering. She did not provide details on the extent of their injuries.

Busy day: Keeping local emergency crews busy, less than four hours after the first collision, pictured, a second was reported involving a silage truck and a freight train

Misjudgement: The driver of the second crash, not pictured, is believed to have misjudged the train's distance and speed when crossing the tracks with no drugs or alcohol involved

Investigation: A cause for either crash, the first pictured, has yet to be determined by the National Transportation Safety Board

'We did call in additional physicians and staff,' Pickering said.

Four additional injured passengers were taken to nearby Adventist Medical Center in Selma.

The train was on its way from Oakland to Bakersfield, according to Amtrak. It had four rail cars and a locomotive.

'This is a big, huge chaotic scene with lots of agencies involved,' California Highway Patrol spokesman Jerry Pierce said.

Covering the scene was also the semi's cargo seen spewed inside and around the train along with metal pieces from the truck. Several pieces of luggage were also seen scattered about.

The CHP will investigate the crash.

Pierce said the other passengers have been taken to an auditorium in Hanford, where they will board a train and continue to their destinations or family members will pick them up.

Eerily the crash was just several hours before a second semi barrelled into a freight train 17 miles away for the first.

No injuries were reported in that crash.
