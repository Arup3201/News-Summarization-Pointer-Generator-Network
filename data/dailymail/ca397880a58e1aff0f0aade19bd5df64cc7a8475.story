Break in: Helen Flanagan is seen outside her home in Cheshire this morning after the break-in last night

She was condemned for tweeting a picture of herself wearing lingerie and wielding a gun just days after a shooting massacre at a US school.

Now it appears that Helen Flanagan may have again come unstuck on Twitter after letting slip that she was at home without her footballer boyfriend Scott Sinclair.

Hours later, three men wielding a screwdriver and a saw burst into the house, confronting Flanagan and a female friend before fleeing with jewellery and a mobile phone.

The men burst into the Cheshire home she shares with her footballer boyfriend Scott Sinclair shortly before midnight.

A spokesman for the former Coronation Street actress confirmed she was left 'shaken' by the incident but is 'coping well'.

The incident happened after Helen, 22, let slip on Twitter that she was in the large detached 
home alone as Manchester City star Scott was away.

She wrote: 'Super tired today, which makes me emotional, sensitive and mental!

'Can't wait to have my boyfriend home.'

The raiders confronted two woman who were inside the home at the time, a police spokesman said.

The incident happened after Helen was seen out in Alderley Edge yesterday afternoon.

Police
were seen outside the property this afternoon, and have been 
interviewing Helen as well as taking evidence from inside. 

A spokesman for Cheshire Police said they were treating the incident as an aggravated burglary.

'We are 
investigating a burglary at a private address in Prestbury reported at 
11.50pm on Monday 17 June,' he said.

'Thieves broke into the detached property and stole items of jewellery and a mobile phone. 

'The investigation into the incident is continuing. Anyone with any information is asked to contact Cheshire Police.'

Helen's boyfriend Scott is a 24-year-old winger who plays for Premier League side Manchester City.

The
footballer was recently told he needs to have his top rib removed 
because he has a blood clot in his shoulder. The surgery will stop him 
from training for the next three months.

It
has been reported that Helen is planning to stay with a friend for the 
next few days before making a decision about whether or not she can 
return to live in the house.

There have been rumours that Helen is
set to split from her long-term partner Scott after he allegedly had a
fling with a mystery woman while on holiday in Monaco.

The star was seen flirting with woman while on holiday and it is thought he did not want a relationship.

However, the model was apparently looking forward to seeing the star when he got back.

Helen reportedly underwent a nose job recently after suffering years of abuse.

Since the age of ten the actress has become a regular face on television screens.

She played hell-raiser Rosie Webster in Coronation Street since 2000, and after she quit the role in 2012 participated in the twelfth series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, where she finished in seventh place out of the 12 celebrities competing.

In October last year she moved her things from her home in Swansea, Wales,into her Sinclair's £6,500 a month Cheshire mansion.

The expensive home is situated in 
Prestbury, Cheshire, an affluent area that is well populated with other 
Premier League footballers.

The surroundings are a far cry from 
the more humble settings Helen and Scott were used to in Swansea, Wales,
where they lived together for just over a year before moving out in 
August last year.

The couple spent most of September living in a suite at the Radisson Blu Edwardian in Manchester.
It has been a tough year for Flanagan.

She faced a public backlash during 
her stint on 'I'm A Celebrity', where the public kept voting for her to 
endure Bushtucker trials.

Then in December last year she revealed her secret battle with depression and how she considered ending her life during her time on Coronation Street.

The fragile actress said that she is on medication for Bipolar disorder and Attention Deficit Disorder but stopped taking it for a year and a half, culminating in a dark spiral into despair.

It was then that the actress decided to quit the soap opera and concentrate on battling her illness, putting herself back on her medication in a bid to turn her life around.

The actress, who has become well-known for her racy photo shoots, is now appearing in her first feature film.

Set in 1970s Lancashire, Fizzy Days is a coming of age story inspired by director Mark Millicient's own teenage years.

The movie tells the tale of school pals Eddy and Tomo, who have their hearts set on owning a Yamaha 'Fizzy' bike in the hope of achieving pop stardom and bagging gorgeous girlfriends.

After getting jobs in a supermarket to fund their dream, the duo decide their plan isn't panning out quickly enough and decide to hold-up their place of work to get enough money for the bike.

Helen plays 'supercool chick' and blonde bombshell Rachel Roberts, the object of affection for the group of teenage boys.

Described as a 'warm and funny film about growing up', Fizzy Days also stars This Is England’s Stephen Graham and Shameless stars Jody Latham and James Drefus.
