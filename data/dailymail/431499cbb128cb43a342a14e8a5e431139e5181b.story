Neymar claimed that he has grown considerably in recent years and become 'a professional'.

The Barcelona forward captained Brazil against Colombia and the 22-year-old feels he is mature enough to handle the responsibility.  

'A lot has changed for me in recent times,' he told Marca. 'I've learnt a lot in the last three to four years.

'I've grown as a player and become a professional. I've learnt from the older heads in the national team and at my clubs. I feel I've changed a lot'

When asked about Dunga's appointment for a second spell in charge of the national side, he said: 'It's tough to take a big change on board when you only have a week to train together; we have to do things gradually and pull together. 

'We have to adapt to the new coach, listening to him and constantly asking him questions, so as to keep improving our performances'
