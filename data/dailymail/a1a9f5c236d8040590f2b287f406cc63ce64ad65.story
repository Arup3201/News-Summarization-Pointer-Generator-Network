Having already attracted more than four million visitors, the Tower of London poppies looked set to cause chaos for police on the last day of the half-term break yesterday.

On Friday, officials even urged the public not to visit amid fears of an unseemly and dangerous crush.

In the event, however, they needn’t have worried. For while their pleas fell on deaf ears, those who turned out in their tens of thousands were a picture of dignity. 

Determined: Thousands of visitors flocked to the Tower of London’s poppy display today despite calls from organisers to cancel weekend visits because of overcrowding

Waiting: visitors queue for the installation, with lines of people stretching on to Tower Bridge as far as the eye can see

Dedicated: Crowds queue around the moat to get a glimpse of the sea of scarlet on the display's penultimate weekend

As the rain poured, orderly queues eight-deep huddled under umbrellas not just around the Tower itself but in a line across Tower Bridge.

Come November 11, Armistice Day, there will be 888,246 ceramic poppies in the Tower of London’s mighty moat – one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers, sailors and airmen who perished in the Great War.

Volunteers will start to take them away the day after November 11 and perhaps this is the reason why so many felt the weekend provided their only opportunity to glimpse the art installation – called Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red.

One mother said she had braved the rain because her six-year-old daughter, Elina, was determined to see the poppies. Lucy Ward, 25, from Chiswick, West London, said: ‘She really wanted to come…she said she really cared about it. 

'It’s important for children to know. My great great grandfather fought in the war and I was telling her about it when we were walking round.’ 

Nearing the end: The Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation will be finished on Remembrance Day, November 11

Success: Up to four million people from around the world have now visited the exhibition at the Tower of London

Congestion: Officials from Historic Royal Palaces, which manages the exhibition, warned that Saturday and Sunday would be be exceptionally busy

Another family had travelled from Leicestershire on Saturday night to be at the Tower first thing on Sunday. David Hughes, 75, said: ‘It’s amazing. When we arrived it was teeming with people – we weren’t aware it was half term. My dad was in the First World War.’ His wife Pauline Hughes, 71, added: ‘My grandad was gassed in the First World War so it’s something very close to us.’

Bev Livermore, 37, from Portsmouth brought her parents Kathy and Mick Haggard, 70, to see the poppies.

It took the family three hours to reach London yesterday. Mrs Haggard, 64, said: ‘I’ve never seen so many people…it’s really lovely and a very nice tribute. It’s something that’s not going to be here much longer. My grandad was killed in the First World War so we’ve been thinking about it.’

Officials from Historic Royal Palaces, which manages the exhibition, had asked those planning to visit the poppies at the weekend to ‘postpone their visit’ until after half term. 

The situation wasn’t helped by the closure of Tower Hill station yesterday, but the crowds remained calm and accepted that to visit such a stunning tribute would demand a little patience.

Meticulous: Around 8,000 volunteers have been working on the powerful exhibition at the tower over the last four months

Journey: The poignant tribute in the tower's moat has come a long way since work originally started on it back in the summer (above)

Each poppy is handmade and carefully shaped by a team of workers in Derby

Each poppy is handmade and individually shaped by a team of local workers in Derby, making each poppy unique.

Clay is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp, much like a large biscuit cutter, carves out petal patterns. They are then paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals.

The petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position.

The bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing.

Ceramic artist Paul Cummins, who came up with the idea, has had a team working on the project since January.

He said: 'I was inspired to create this installation after reading a living will by an unknown soldier who we think may have been from Derby. I approached the Tower as the ideal setting as its strong military links seemed to resonate.

'The installation is transient, I found this poignant and reflective of human life, like those who lost their lives during First World War. I wanted to find a fitting way to remember them'.

He came up with the idea of creating a 'sea' of poppies two years and was delighted when the Tower of London decided to bring his idea to life with the help of set designer Tom Piper.

The artist has experience of working with historic buildings and over the last three years he has been commissioned to create large-scale installations for the Duke of Devonshire's Chatsworth House, Derby Royal Hospital, Althorp Estate and Blenheim Palace.
