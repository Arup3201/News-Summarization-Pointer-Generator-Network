After what had been a difficult start to his tenure at Manchester United, Louis van Gaal could have reflected on beating Everton 2-1 with some satisfaction.

His team had climbed into the  Premier League’s top four and they had done so thanks to a first United goal for Radamel Falcao. 

But Van Gaal looked as deflated as the punctured tyre that disrupted his departure from the training ground a few days earlier — and understandably so.

Louis van Gaal leaves the Old Trafford pitch on Sunday after his side narrowly beat Everton 2-1

Luke Shaw (left) gave away a needless penalty against the Toffees and was unconvincing at left back

He knew his side owed too much to the brilliance of David de Gea, as well as the profligacy of Leighton Baines from the penalty spot. Just as he knew a team attacking with more confidence would have exploited what remains an alarming imbalance in his side. 

He is trying to address the issue with his calls for a more collective approach to defending, and for 45 minutes of an entertaining match he probably felt his players were pretty much following his instructions. 

But when only West Bromwich Albion now stand between back-to-back encounters with Chelsea and Manchester City, significant progress still needs to be made. 

Van Gaal's side might well have drawn or even lost against Everton were it not for  David de Gea's heroics

United are scoring plenty of goals, with Radamel Falcao opening his account against Roberto Martinez's side, but it's defensively where there are concerns

‘We have to improve a lot of things,’ was one of the first statements the Dutchman made in a series of post-match interviews, even if he did then offer a more positive spin when he suggested the fact that they had risen to fourth playing badly was a cause for optimism.

But his initial point was correct because United need to improve on an awful lot, in particular across a back four that remains alarmingly fragile.

This was only Luke Shaw’s second competitive appearance for United but he managed to demonstrate the best and worst aspects of his game in the 70 minutes he played prior to leaving the field with a knee injury. 

Tyler Blackett and Marcos Rojo have played well at times but both struggled in the 5-3 defeat by Leicester

If Shaw  oozed class going forward, he proved such a liability in defence that it was easy to see why Roy Hodgson would rather see him back in England’s Under 21 squad for now.

It was not just the penalty he conceded; a reckless challenge on Tony Hibbert. It was a general lack of composure whenever Everton attacked down his flank and the role he played — albeit a minor one compared to Rafael — in allowing Steven Naismith to score his 55th-minute equaliser.

Shaw would do well to study his predecessors because, in Denis Irwin and Patrice Evra, United have had two left backs who mastered both aspects of a full back’s job; who were brilliantly effective going forward but were also key members of a superbly organised back four.

Van Gaal's defence has been weakened further by the absence of the injured Jonny Evans

Shaw is still young, of course. Talented, too. But it is a concern when good defending relies so much on instinct and he will need to show he can be trusted if he wants to remain in the side once players like Jonny Evans are fit.

Particularly when Van Gaal still has the option of Marcos Rojo, however much that might alarm United supporters haunted by his efforts at left back earlier this season.

A more accurate measure of United’s strengths and weaknesses will come at home to Chelsea and away to City. Excellent on debut last week, Paddy McNair did a fine job in dealing with the physical presence of Romelu Lukaku on Sunday.

United take on Chelsea and Manchester City in two of their next three matches and need to be more solid

But Lukaku is not of the quality of forwards McNair could soon be facing and that’s where the issue of collective responsibility became more of a pressing concern for Van Gaal.

United’s back four needs to operate with more cohesion but it needs more protection, too, as the runs from deep by Leon Osman and Bryan Oviedo late in this game illustrated. Nobody was picking up Everton’s substitutes and, had it not been for De Gea, their efforts could have been extremely costly for the hosts.

Angel Di Maria's terrific form since joining from Real Madrid has given the Old Trafford club a big lift 

Going forward, United are terrific; as good as any team in the Premier League and so blessed with quality that the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney caused little disruption. Angel di Maria continues to thrill and Falcao is starting to prove himself quite the predator with a fine demonstration of forward play crowned by his winning goal.

But Van Gaal was not getting carried away, with his focus afterwards more on Di Maria’s defending than the goal and the assist he produced.

Mainly because United’s manager knows what is coming next.
