Nearly half of Britons admitted to giving up on jobs halfway through, with incompetence, busy schedules and boredom being the most common reasons

We may like to think we have a do it yourself mentality… but half of Britons surveyed admit they fail to complete home improvement jobs.

Bleeding radiators, fitting loft insulation and installing a new boiler are the main jobs we leave unfinished.

Energy company E.ON asked more than 2,000 adults about the work they carry out at home.

Some 44 per cent said they fail to complete DIY jobs.

This is because 25 per cent said they are no good at it, 24 per cent do not have enough spare time and 16 per cent just get bored and give up.

Londoners are the least likely to finish the job, with 32 per cent admitting they do not achieve their DIY goals.

Those in the West Midlands are the most likely, with an 85 per cent success rate, followed by Wales, at 84 per cent, the East Midlands at 82 per cent and Yorkshire at 81 per cent.

Women are more likely than men to complete a project, with 78 per cent of females seeing tasks through to the end, compared to only 76 per cent of men.

Finance worker Matthew Allen from Southampton, Hampshire, admits making home improvements is 'incredibly boring'.

Women are more likely to follow a task through to completion, with 77% claiming to see projects to the end, compared to only 76% for men

Londoners are the least likely to finish DIY jobs, while those in the West Midlands are the most determined to get things done

The 38-year-old said: 'I wanted to add loft insulation to my house because it was getting cold in the winter - but I gave up half way through.

'It was just incredibly dull, boring and unpleasant. I’d intended to lay it and board bits out but I got fed up and left the job half done.'
