A Wall Street financier has completed the Ice Bucket Challenge in the most luxurious manner yet, filming himself as he jumps into a freezing tub at his $23.6 million penthouse in downtown Manhattan.

Richard B. Handler, the chief executive of the investment bank Jefferies Group and its parent company, the Leucadia National Corporation, decided to skip the bucket all together as he took part in the challenge, which benefits the A.L.S. Association, and instead dunked himself in an icy bath.

The video, which was uploaded on Tuesday, prominently showcases his apartment's stunning views of Manhattan.

'There’s a special stipulation in this challenge, I’m not sure people are aware of it,' he says in the video. 

'Instead of taking a bucket and dumping it on your head, if you put yourself and dump yourself into the bucket, you’re allowed to nominate four people instead of three people.' 

Handler, 52,nominated three other Wall Street execs; Tilman J. Fertitta, the CEO of Landry's, Inc.; Gerald Hassell, the CEO of The Bank of New York Mellon; and  Carl Icahn, the 78-year-old businessman whose net worth is $24.5 billion.

Icahn took to Twitter to say he would get back to Handler on the challenge, but was currently 'too busy working on BIG deal with another investment banker.'

For his fourth nomination, Handler selected rapper Armando Perez, better known as Pitbull.

It was another financial bigwig, KCG Chief Executive Officer Daniel Coleman, who nominated Handler.

Thanks in large part to the challenge, the A.L.S. Association has received $88.5 million in donations from late July through Tuesday, compared with $2.6 million in the period a year earlier.

Handler, whose 2012 salary as CEO of the Jeffries firm was $58 million according to the Daily News, may however soon be losing a little bit of that gorgeous view from his 14th-Floor penthouse, as there is a proposal to build a two-story rooftop restaurant nearby.

He sued the landlord of 50 Varick Street and the Department of Buildings in March of last year, alleging the restaurant flouted zoning guidelines.

'The project will significantly obstruct the panoramic river views from his apartment,' Handler's lawyer said in their lawsuit. 

If the plan goes through, Handler would lose part of his view of New Jersey.
