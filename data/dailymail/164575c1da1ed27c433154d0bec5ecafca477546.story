A mother has been been arrested for allegedly renting out her two daughters for sex, one aged just 14 and the other an adult. 

Antwana Muhammad, 39, and her boyfriend, Charles Smith, 32, of Perris, California were arrested on Thursday and have been accused of exploiting her 14-year-old daughter throughout Southern California.

It was revealed during an investigation that Muhammad's adult daughter was also being exploited.

It is believed that her daughters were pimped throughout Murrieta, the San Fernando Valley and other areas across Southern California, according to NBC. 

Riverside County Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force began investigating the family in February, according to The Press Enterprise. 

Smith posted online advertisements soliciting his girlfriend's daughters for prostitution and Muhammad took them to perform the activities, police said. 

Muhammad and Smith allegedly kept all of the earnings from the soliciting. 

The couple are being held on charges of human trafficking of a minor, pandering of a minor and pimping. They could also face charges of child endangerment, police said.

Bail for Smith and Muhammad was set at $250,000.

The daughters were taken into custody by Child Protective Services.
