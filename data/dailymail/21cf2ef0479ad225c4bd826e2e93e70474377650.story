Paul Keating unleashed a scathing assessment of his relationship with former Prime Minister Bob Hawke claiming he basically ran the country in the nude while Mr Keating did most of the work.

Mr Keating, a former Prime Minister himself, said he ran the country for five of the nine years Mr Hawke was in office while he served as his Treasurer between 1984-89.

He added that Mr Hawke regularly sunbathed in the nude by the pool at the prime minister's Canberra residence, even when cabinet ministers had come around to talk about important issues.

Mr Keating's comments came as he launched the diaries of Gareth Evans, a former Labor minister, in Canberra on Wednesday.

The diaries give an account inside the Hawke Keating Government between 1984-86 and Mr Keating used segments of the book to critique his testing relationship with Mr Hawke, including having to talk to him in the nude.

'I'd arrive at The Lodge at 10.30 and find Bob sunning himself by the pool,' Mr Keating told the launch audience, according to News Corp.

'He often used to do this nude.'

He even recalled joking about the size of Mr Hawke's manhood.

'I did have a few things to say about midgets... on the occasion, but this is not the occasion for elaborating,' he said.

'Gareth and I went out there is suits one day, sweating, and there's Bob in the nude.'

After one particular meeting, Mr Keating recalled Mr Evans saying 'it does take a certain chutzpah' to meet ministers in the nude, Fairfax reports.

Noting some of the diary's other recollections, Mr Keating claimed Mr Hawke was ineffective as a leader between 1984 and 1989 - a period in which he believes he controlled the government's agenda.

'I got on well with him, I still talk him into things, the camaraderie between us was good. I wanted the country to get the changes, more than to get Bob's job,' Mr Keating said.

'But I don't have people say that he ran the show from 84-89. He didn't.

Mr Keating said he would not have talked about Mr Hawke's failing if not for the diary written by Mr Evans

'Any treasurer is lucky to have a prime minister who will do mostly what he wants, and I had that in Bob Hawke. I acknowledge that freely, completely. We were a great partnership together.'

Mr Keating said he would not have talked about Mr Hawke's failing if not for the diary written by Mr Evans.
