Bumper crop: Warm weather has led to a huge harvest of blackberries this year

Blackberry farmers are expecting a bumper crop of super-sweet fruits this year thanks to the warm weather.

Growers have harvested 1,123 tonnes already compared to 808 this time last year and expect to net 2,000 tonnes by the end of the season, nearly double more than last autumn.

Experts say the abundant harvest is due to ideal growing conditions during mild weather last winter and a long and settled summer.

Industry body British Summer Fruits said blackberries emerged around a month earlier than expected with an abundance of large, succulent fruit still to be picked.

Chairman Laurence Olins said growers are also using new technology to breed sweeter varieties.

He said: ‘British consumers are some of the luckiest in the world when it comes to blackberries as the UK is at the forefront of new technologies and breeding methods, resulting in exceptional quality, flavourful fruit.

‘Our growers have seen the market grow substantially in recent years, by more than 70 per cent in the last decade.’

The remarkable autumn weather is set to run and run, with a glorious weekend in store.

Temperatures in the south could hit 23C (73F) tomorrow (Sunday) with highs of 21C (70F) elsewhere, forecasters said.

The temperatures are way above the 16C (61F) daytime average for September.

There will be a misty start today and tomorrow - but the fogs will clear to leave a glorious, sunny and dry weekend for most parts of the country.

Warm weather is due to set in tomorrow, and should stay dry into October apart from a brief storm on Monday. Pictured here: Trebah Gardens near Falmouth, Cornwall, where the garden is still in wonderful bloom thanks to the warm weather

A storm will blow in on Monday in southern parts - the result of the warm weather on Sunday - but it will quickly clear.

Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘This is pretty amazing weather for September.

‘After a really warm weekend we will have some storms in the south on Monday - but once we get past that we will have a lot more fine and dry weather.

‘It is looking like it will last until the beginning of October, which is quite remarkable.’

Met Office spokeswoman Laura Young said: ‘Temperatures will be above average for the next week thanks to high pressure prevailing over the south.

‘There cold be some fog around on Saturday morning mainly in the south east and across the West Country sand maybe Wales.’

Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, added: ‘There is a fine and mainly dry weekend ahead, away from the far north, and becoming quite warm in the south.’
