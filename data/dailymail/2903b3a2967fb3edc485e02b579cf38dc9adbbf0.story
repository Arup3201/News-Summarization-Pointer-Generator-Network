Chuba Akpom is on the verge of signing a new four-and-a-half year deal at Arsenal. 

The 19-year-old's current contract expires in the summer and a host of big clubs have been keen to sign the highly-rated forward.

But after  crunch talks with manager Arsene Wenger and a recent increase in game time, Akpom will sign a new deal keeping him at the club until the end of the 2018-19 season.

Dortmund and Liverpool were, among others, interested in signing the England youth international and for some time it looked as though he would leave the Emirates Stadium.

But the departures of Joel Campbell, Yaya Sanogo and Lukas Podolski have seen him move up the pecking order and Akpom has decided his best interests will be served in north London.

Akpom joined Arsenal's academy in 2002 and made his debut for the Under 18 side aged just 15. 

The talented front man, who has previously had loan spells at Brentford and Coventry, has made five appearances for the Gunners' first team this season.

Akpom is still waiting for his first senior goal for the club but has been prolific for Arsenal's Under 21 side, scoring 15 times in 23 appearances for them last season.

Akpom is yet to score his first senior goal for Arsenal, but came close in the 5-0 thrashing of Villa
