A paedophile has been jailed for 19 years after a school dinner lady overheard one of his victims talking about the abuse.

Martin Thomas lured five girls into his home by offering to teach them about wildlife in his garden pond.

But once they were there the 63-year-old retired trawlerman then forced them to take part in sex acts with him, Exeter Crown Court heard today.

Thomas was trapped after a dinner lady overheard a six-year-old girl talking 
about male genitalia and suspected something was wrong.

A police inquiry found Thomas had been preying on girls aged six to ten for almost a decade without any of his young victims summoning the courage to report what he had done.

Thomas lived in Brixham, South Devon and targeted girls living nearby.

Some of the victims came forward after learning of Thomas's initial court appearance in their local paper.

He denied having touched any of the children but was found guilty after three of the girls gave almost identical accounts of being abused.

Thomas, Brixham, denied a series of sexual offences but was found guilty of the rape of three girls, and indecency offences against two others.

He was jailed for 19 years with a six year extended licence by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, at Exeter Crown Court.

He told him: 'The level of depravity was exceptional and was your willingness to disregard the risk of detection. That adds to the dangerousness I attribute to you.

'The victims... were allowed to go to your house because you were trusted by their parents.

'When the opportunity arose you abused them. At the time they did not realise what was happening and they were unable to prevent you committing these offences.

'They know now what you did and the level of distress and pain they showed when reliving their experience was very apparent for all to see.

'Part of your excitement seems to have been derived from the fact you were running enormous risks.

'It was part of your pattern of depravity that you took as many risks as you could. It seems to be there is such a risk of future offending that you are a very dangerous man indeed.'

During a week long trial all five girls gave evidence by video link or behind screens and told how they were abused at his home.

A school dinner lady testified how she overheard a six-year-old girl talking with friends .

She was so alarmed by what she heard she reported it to the head.

The girl's mother was called in and initially could not believe what had happened but then went to the police.

The victims all told similar stories of abuse and all remembered Thomas by his distinctive accent, which they thought to be Australian, even though he actually came from New Zealand.

Thomas denied all the allegations and said he had only been alone with children on very rare occasions and that his wife was home most of the time.

He said: 'All I have ever shown to those girls is kindness'.
