CNN anchor Zoraida Sambolin, who underwent a double mastectomy last month for preventative reasons, has shared the latest on her recovery - revealing that her 'gut feeling' was in fact right.

Ms Sambolin, 47, who anchors Early Start updated fans on her health via Skype, explaining that 'things are going well'. 

'It's been a pretty tough process,' she told CNN. 'But my prognosis is good now.'

Recovery process: CNN anchor Zoraida Sambolin, who underwent a double mastectomy last month for preventative reasons, has shared the latest on her recovery - revealing that her 'gut feeling' was in fact right

'What they found in my left breast was breast cancer stage one, grade one invasive, but the good news is my lymph nodes are free and clear, so I'm good.

'My right breast actually ended up having Lobular Carcinoma two, and was headed in the same direction as my left breast, so I made a good decision, and now everything has been taken care of.'

Last month, Ms Sambolin revealed she was undergoing the same procedure as Angelina Jolie while discussing the Hollywood star on her show.

The host was diagnosed with breast cancer in her left breast, and underwent the double mastectomy on June 4th.

She told viewers in May that she felt able to share her illness after Ms Jolie announced she was having a double mastectomy, and dozens of people took to Facebook and Twitter to congratulate Ms Sambolin on her bravery and wish her well in her recovery.

Now that she is in the final stages of recovery, she said: 'My gut feeling [about her right breast] was right. . . Because even if this had not come out the way it did on my right breast, I really couldn't sleep at night. All I could think about was, "What if," and 'What does the future hold?"

'For me it made sense to take them both based on what I had seen in my past MRI's and in my mammograms,' she explained. 'I strongly encourage women to stay on top of it, talk to your doctors, and that way you can feel really confident that you're making the right decision.'

Now, Ms Sambolin must meet with an oncologist and find out if she wants to go on any drugs, because, she says, 'I have a higher risk of developing more cancers in the future.'

The mother-of-one told CNN viewers last month 
that - like Ms Jolie - wanting to be there for her children helped her make
 the decision to have a double mastectomy.

She
 wrote on Facebook after the show: 'I struggled for weeks trying to 
figure out how tell you that I had been diagnosed with breast cancer and
 was leaving to have surgery then Angelina Jolie shares her story of a 
double mastectomy and gives me strength and an opening.'

Ms Jolie revealed that she was forced to
 make the agonizing decision to have a preventative double mastectomy, 
after tests showed she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting cancer.

The actress made her first public appearance earlier this month after opening up about her experience in the New York Times 
when she announced she underwent the procedure in April, once she learned that 
she is a carrier of the BRCA1 cancer gene.

The 37-year-old's mother Marcheline 
Bertrand died at the age of 56 from ovarian cancer and her aunt also died of breast cancer in the past month.

Angelina's mother Marcheline Bertrand died from ovarian cancer at 56. When Angelina discovered her mother's cancer was hereditary, she said that she decided to reduce the risk

Jolie attended the London and Paris premiers of partner Brad Pitt's World War Z movie.

She told reporters: ‘I feel great, I feel wonderful and I’m very very grateful for all the support, it means a lot to me.

‘[Pitt's] been extraordinary. He’s such a wonderful man and a wonderful father, I’m very very lucky,' she said, praising her future husband, Brad, for his support during her treatment.

‘I’ve been very happy just to see the discussion about women’s health expanded and that means the world to me.’

The star's surgery was successful and
 doctors say Angelina's chances of developing breast cancer have now 
lowered to less than five per cent.

Writing in an editorial piece entitled 'My Medical Choice', Jolie said: 'On a personal note, I do not feel 
any less of a woman.

'I feel empowered that I made a strong 
choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.'

And she added that she had wanted to speak out about her experience so that other women could consider their options.

'I
 am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit 
from my experience,' she wrote.

'Cancer is still a word that strikes 
fear into people’s hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness.

'But
 today it is possible to find out through a blood test whether you are 
highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.'
