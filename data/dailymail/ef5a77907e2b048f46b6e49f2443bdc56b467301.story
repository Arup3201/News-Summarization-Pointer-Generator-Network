The 12-year-old girl who was lured into the woods and brutally stabbed 19 times by  classmates hoping to impress the fictional character Slender Man has revealed her identity for the first time.

Payton Leutner was completely oblivious to what police describe as a five-month plan concocted by her best friends to murder her when she excitedly arrived for a sleepover in late May.

But just hours later she was crawling for her life from the woods in Waukesha, Wisconsin, after being stabbed in the chest, abdomen, legs and arms. 

Revealed: This is 12-year-old Payton Leutner who was stabbed 19 times by her two friends who allegedly wanted to murder her and pretend she had been killed by a fictional 'bogeyman' called Slender Man

Wounds: Faint marks up Payton's left arm betray her horrific ordeal which left her fighting for life in May

Tonight, she appeared in public for the first time on ABC's 20/20 as it is revealed for the first time that the knife missed her major artery by less than a hair's width. 

And her mother Stacie Leutner - who has also remained anonymous until tonight - reveals Payton had feared the specter known as Slender Man before the attack, and tried to back away as they neared the woods 'sensing something was wrong'. 

Until now, Payton has not been identified or previously pictured, apart from an image showing her being carried away on a stretcher.

Her attackers, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, have since been charged as adults for first-degree intentional homicide but questions remain over whether they will be competent to stand trial. 

Smiling, playing with a cat, and watching a video of the Katy Perry concert she went to the night before, Payton looks like any other carefree little girl.

However, the marks on her arm betray a horrific ordeal that she is still unable to acknowledge even to her parents. 

Recovering: She has now finally returned to school but at first could not even speak due to her injuries

Ordeal: Prosecutors warn there is a chance Payton will have to give evidence in the trial against her attackers

Smiling: Payton did not talk in the report but was seen shopping and playing with animals as she recovers

Moving forward: Her parents said she was so excited to go back to school to rebuild her life after the trauma

Big step: She is pictured here getting in the car to go back to school for her first day since the attack

Payton did not speak in the report where she is shown shopping, going to an animal shelter, and getting in the car to drive for school for her first day since the attack.

But her parents describe the horrific night.  

'I walked into the trauma room she was in. She was pale as a ghost,' says her mother Stacie Leutner, recounting the moment she arrived at the hospital.

'She was crying. She couldn't breathe. She saw me. She put her hand out and I rushed over to her and I put my arms around her and I laid next to her.' 

She went on: 'She saw me and she put her hand out and I hugged her and I told her, 'you're going to be OK, it's going to be fine'. But I could see that she was covered in stab wounds.' 

Looking over the wounds to her daughter's body, she counted five on her arm and seven on her leg.

Devastated: The parents of the 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times and left for dead in a Wisconsin park in May have spoken out on camera for the first time in an interview with ABC, which will air on Friday

Heartbroken: The girl's mother described her shock at seeing her daughter in hospital for the first time

'I heard one nurse say, 'I count 19',' Stacie said.

The surgeon, remembering the most horrific night of his career, said: 'If the knife had gone the width of a human hair further, she would be dead.

'She was less than a millimeter between living and dying'.  

Payton's injuries left her unable to talk  so she was forced to write notes to her family. The first asked: 'did they find them?'

Her parents eventually asked Payton how she found the strength to crawl  out of the forest, and she told them: 'I wanted to live.'  

'She's an amazing child,' her mother said, while her father Joe added: 'She's definitely our hero.' 

The report unveils the 911 call made by a cyclist who found Payton struggling to breathe and covered in blood on a path near the woods in Waukesha. The call-handler is audibly in disbelief. 

Fighter: The little girl, pictured with ABC News reporter David Muir, will also appear on the show. She spent six weeks in the hospital after she was stabbed multiple times over her arms, legs and abdomen

Survivor: The girl, pictured on a stretcher, managed to crawl out of the woods and alert a passing cyclist

The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009.

The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit.

The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia.

It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport.

It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009.

It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'.

Payton's mother, Stacie Leutner, said her daughter asked about Slender Man before the attack because stories shared by her friend frightened her. Payton insisted her best friend knew Slender Man was real. Leutner was not overly concerned.

'Fantasy when you are 12 years old is still a very active part of your life,' she said.

Weier and Geyser told investigators they stabbed the girl to impress Slender Man, a tall, fictional bogeyman popular on the Internet that they insisted was real, according to a criminal complaint.

In an official police report Weier said Slender Man is the 'leader' of Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty.

She explained Geyser told her they needed to slaughter their friend  to become 'proxies' of Slender Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest.

They planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion, they told police.

The forest is five miles from Waukesha by car. 

Geyser was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night.

Police tonight revealed the girls had been plotting the attack for five months and initial intended to murder Payton in her sleep at Morgan's house but backed out at the last minute.

Payton's mother believes the change of plan saved her life.

Arrests: Anissa Weir, left, and Morgan Geyser, right, allegedly stabbed the girl after inviting her over for a sleepover. They had wanted to impress a fictional horror character, Slender Man, with the killing

In court: Weier is pictured in court in June, but doctors have deemed she is not competent to stand trial

Charged: Weier, also charged as an adult, is undergoing competency tests to determine if she can stand trial

They changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down.

When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband.  

They planned to play hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of sight, in the trees. 

It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed their friend 19 times.

Weier said that the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood.  

'Obsessed': Slender Man, left, is a popular online character who abducts children. Right, before the stabbing, Geyser's father proudly shared this image that his daughter had drawn of the character on a menu

Despite her numerous wounds, she was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The victim spent six days in the hospital. 

The two young suspects were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack.

Geyser and Weier face up to 60 years in prison if convicted as adults of attempted homicide. They could be incarcerated to age 25 if they are convicted as juveniles under state law. 

Two doctors concluded that Geyser was mentally incompetent to stand trial and Weier is currently undergoing competency tests, which must be completed by mid-October.
