Thousands of British families could be denied compensation for the deaths or illness of relatives caused by a dangerous diabetes drug, despite similar cases being settled at a cost of billions of dollars in the U.S.

Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline has agreed to pay claims of victims in the U.S., but it has told British victims that it will challenge their requests for compensation in court, their lawyers have said.

The diabetes drug Avandia had its European licence revoked in September 2010 because of evidence it could cause heart failure or heart attacks.

GlaxoSmithKline, which is based in the UK, has admitted concealing data about the damaging side effects of the drug, but it has told victims it is not willing to settle UK claims without a court fight.

Daniel Slade, of Express solicitors, which is representing 19 victims, said that that unlike in the U.S. where GSK has settled claims outside of court, it will contest the cases here.

He said that it will now take years for bereaved families or those harmed by the drug to get any sort of compensation.

He told The Guardian: ‘It is very disappointing. We anticipate that these claims do have a good prospect of success, but they still have to prove their case in the UK with suitable evidence.

‘They are tasked with having to produce that evidence, including medical expert opinion. It is a burden one would have thought they might not have to go through.’

A spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline told the newspaper: ‘We have every sympathy for people with complications associated with diabetes and those who care for them, but unfortunately we are unable to comment on individual legal cases.

‘We continue to believe that the company acted appropriately and responsibly in its management of Avandia.’

There were around 90,000 people taking Avandia in the UK when it was banned, eight years after it was introduced in the NHS in 2000.

It was given to people with type 2 diabetes whose glucose levels could not be controlled by standard drugs.

Trials on the drug found that it could cause heart attacks and made patients more likely to suffer strokes and heart failure.

GSK pleaded guilty to federal charges of concealing data about the drug’s side effects. It agreed to pay $3bn to the U.S. government in November 2011 over issues with the drug and to end investigations into the marketing of antidepressants Paxil and Wellbutrin.
