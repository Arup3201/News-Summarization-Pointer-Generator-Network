A mother, whose son said Sandusky raped him in the basement of the coach's home, testified today that the boy's laundry was often short of underwear.

She was the last to speak for the prosecution as defense lawyers for the former Penn State coach brought their first witnesses in his sexual abuse trial.

The
woman said her son told her that Sandusky called him late one night 
after the first round of charges were filed in November, asking if he 
would be a character witness.

One month later, prosecutors brought charges against Sandusky, alleging he had forced anal sex with the boy at his home in Pennsylvania.

The
woman said her son's laundry, which she did two or three times a week, would often be short of underwear and he 
would claim he had thrown it away because he had an accident.

She said: 'I always wondered why he 
never had any underwear in the laundry. There was never any underwear, 
any socks... that was odd to me.'

On cross-examination she told Sandusky's attorney Joseph Amendola: 'He would tell me he had an accident and threw them out.

'All the time, his stomach always hurt. [He] couldn't use the bathroom right.'

Last week 
the teenager, now 18, said Sandusky forced him to have anal sex that made him bleed.

The woman wept as she told the court that she felt responsible because she had encouraged her son to go to the coach's house while she was working two jobs to support the family, according to philly.com

The boy first met Sandusky at the age of 12 through the Second Mile charity, which the coach founded to provide help for troubled youngsters.

Over the next four years, the witness said her son began to have health problems and get into trouble at school. The mother said the boy became emotionally closed off and didn't want to spend weekends at the coach's house.Â

Prosecutors withdrew one count against Sandusky today saying the statute he was charged under did not apply at the time of the alleged illegal contact.

That leaves 51 counts involving ten alleged victims over a 15-year span. Sandusky, whose November arrest led to the firing of Hall of Fame football coach Joe Paterno, has denied wrongdoing.

A former Penn State assistant coach 
who worked with Sandusky testified today that he and other members
of the football staff were present when Sandusky brought young boys 
into the team's showers.

Dick
Anderson, the first witness called by the defense after prosecutors 
rested their case, said he never witnessed anything inappropriate.

'If
Jerry would bring someone in with The Second Mile, they had been 
working out, for whatever reason they came in, it was not uncommon ... 
with the other coaches in the shower as well,' Anderson said.

Anderson also testified that it was not unusual for him to be in the showers with younger boys at the YMCA. During his testimony, Anderson said Sandusky had a 'wonderful reputation' in the community.

'He was well thought of in every regard,' Anderson said.

He also testified about the busy schedule Penn State coaches kept.

In their questions to prosecution witnesses, the defense has sought to show how the stories of accusers have changed over time.

The defense says witnesses were prodded and coached by investigators and prosecutors, that some are motivated to lie by the hopes of a civil lawsuit jackpot, and to paint Sandusky's interactions with children as misunderstood and part of a lifelong effort to help, not victimize, them.

Defense attorney Joe Amendola pressed the accusers for dates and locations, details of their involvement with the kids' charity Sandusky founded, arrests or drug problems, contacts they had with Sandusky in the years since the alleged abuse ended and the terms of representation deals with civil lawyers.

At least six said they told incorrect or incomplete stories in early contacts with police, and three testified that some of the details only came back to them in recent years.
