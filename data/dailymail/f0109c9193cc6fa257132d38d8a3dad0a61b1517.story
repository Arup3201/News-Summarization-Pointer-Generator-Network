Teresa Giudice's life fell apart this week as the reality star and her husband were charged with 39-counts of financial fraud.

And just when it seemed things couldn't get any worse it has emerged that her show The Real Housewives Of New Jersey could even be cancelled in the wake of her criminal case.

The news came as Teresa stepped out looking happy and carefree on Wednesday, apparently putting a brave face on the scandal.

The mother-of-four was seen with her daughter Milania in Paterson New Jersey on Tuesday, looking calm and confident.

There were certainly no signs of fear or discomfort as she smiled and laughed with her daughter.

But behind the scenes her future is not so rosy.

According to the New York Daily News bosses at Bravo have been horrified by the bad publicity surrounding the Giudice family - the main stars on RHONJ.

And the network is said to be seriously considering cancelling the entire show.

Nobody wants to see their talent in this kind of a situation,' a network source told the paper.

Tentative plans for a spin off show have already been cancelled.

'They are not interested,' the insider explained. 'Bravo only spins off happy situations â€” marriages, baby news. Not prison.'

Off somewhere? There have been reports that Teresa and husband Joe could have been planning a 'great escape' to Italy

Teresa broke her silence on her official Twitter account on Wednesday to talk about the case.

'Thank
you all so so much for your love and support. It means the world to me 
and my family,' adding: 'I wish I could hug you all right now.'

Yesterday
it was revealed that Teresa and her husband Joe had been released on a 
combined $1million bail after making initial court appearances Tuesday 
on federal fraud charges.

The
couple have been ordered to surrender their passports and to confine 
their travels to New Jersey and New York. Joe Giudice could be deported 
to Italy if convicted because he is not a U.S. citizen.

Radar claims that authorities were smart to impose the limits on their travel, as Joe and Teresa could have been planning a 'great escape' to Italy.

Teresa, 41, and her 43-year-old husband had toned down their usual flamboyant look to wear differing shades of slate suit, the reality TV queen even had her famous hair slicked back into a sensible ponytail as she walked into Martin Luther King Jr. courthouse in Newark, New Jersey.

The couple were charged in a 39-count indictment Monday with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud.

They are accused of exaggerating their income while applying for loans before their TV show debuted in 2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after their first season aired.

Authorities allege the couple submitted 
fraudulent mortgage and other loan applications from 2001 to 2008, a 
year before their show debuted on Bravo. Prosecutors said the couple 
submitted fake W-2s, tax returns and bank account information to 
lenders.

In a statement, Teresa said she supports her husband and wants to resolve the charges as soon as possible.

'I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which includes continuing my career,' she said.

In their 2009 bankruptcy filing, the couple said they were $11 million in debt. They stated their monthly take-home pay was $16,583, but $10,000 was from 'monthly assistance from family members' and Bravo income.

It also said they owed $2.2 million in mortgages, $13,000 to Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom and nearly $12,000 to a fertility clinic.

The most serious charges the couple face, bank fraud and loan application fraud, carry a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of more 50 years in prison.
