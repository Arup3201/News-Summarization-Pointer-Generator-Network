Champion chaser Sire De Grugy will miss his intended reappearance in the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham on Sunday after returning lame following a workout on Wednesday morning.

Trainer Gary Moore had initially expressed satisfaction after the Queen Mother Champion Chase winner engaged in a routine spin on the gallops ahead of his weekend assignment, but a problem has now come to light.

But he later said: ‘He's not going to run on Sunday, unfortunately. He worked well this morning and was fine straight after, but he's lame now.’

The West Sussex handler insists it is too early to know whether his stable star will be able to defend his crown in the Tingle Creek at Sandown on December 6 but admitted: ‘It's up in the air. There's nothing obvious, but he is lame. It is a big worry.’

Sunday’s race was scheduled to be the race which teed Sire De Grugy up for the Tingle Creek where his opponents are expected to include 2013 Champion Chase winner Sprinter Sacre.
