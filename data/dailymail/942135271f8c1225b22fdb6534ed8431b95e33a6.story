Minecraft founder Markus Persson is said to be on the verge of selling his hugely-popular game to Microsoft.

Reports in the Wall Street Journal claim the software giant has made an offer thought to be worth $2 billion – and the deal could take place as early as next week.

In 2012, Persson criticised Windows 8 and Microsoft for trying to 'ruin the PC as an open platform', he also separately said his price to ‘endorse cr*p’ was $2 billion dollars, which may explain the pricing of the deal.

The deal would match the amount Facebook paid for virtual reality headset firm which creates Oculus Rift.

Persson created Minecraft in 2009 before releasing it widely in November 2011.

At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon.

There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs.

Since last November, Minecraft has become one of publishing's most successful franchises with a series of compact, illustrated books, too.

This includes three guides - Minecraft: Essential Handbook, Minecraft: Redstone Handbook and Minecraft: Construction Handbook - that have already sold more than 6 million copies combined, according to publisher Scholastic.

In 2012, founder Markus Persson, who tweets under the handle @notch, openly criticised Microsoft's Windows 8 software (pictured). He also said 'Got an email from Microsoft, wanting to help 'certify' Minecraft for Windows 8. I told them to stop trying to ruin the PC as an open platform'

Persson also separately tweeted this his price to ‘endorse cr*p’ was $2 billion dollars, which may explain the pricing of the deal. The deal would also match the amount Facebook paid for virtual reality headset firm which creates Oculus Rift

This success is undoubtedly what appeals to Microsoft.

In October, Ordnance Survey released Minecraft Britain, a 3D gaming map that lets users them explore the whole of the UK and build new settlements in their virtual back gardens.

Minecraft Britain was built using Ordnance Survey maps of the UK as a base and was constructed using 22 billion building blocks from the game.

It covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles of mainland Great Britain and the surrounding islands and each block represents 50 square metres.
