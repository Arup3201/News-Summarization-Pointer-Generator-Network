The education watchdog was yesterday accused of risking children’s safety by ditching plans for routine snap inspections of schools.

Sir Michael Wilshaw provoked fury among supporters of former Education Secretary Michael Gove after rejecting demands for Ofsted to stop giving schools notice of visits by its inspectors.

This is the second occasion on which current Education Secretary Nicky Morgan’s administration appears to have backtracked on a policy of her predecessor.

Sir Michael Wilshaw has been criticised by supporters of Michael Gove for abandoning no-notice inspections

Mr Gove and David Cameron publicly backed a move to unannounced visits for all schools following the ‘Trojan Horse’ revelations that Islamic extremists had tried to infiltrate governing bodies at a string of Birmingham schools. Some schools were said to have put on ‘hastily arranged shows of cultural inclusivity’ such as lessons on Christianity after receiving notice that inspectors were poised to visit.

But Sir Michael, the chief inspector, insisted yesterday he did ‘not need’ to introduce routine no-notice inspections for all schools but that they would still be conducted in specific schools if Ofsted received reports of declining standards.

Now Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Mr Gove, has accused Sir Michael of bowing to pressure from teaching unions which had bitterly resisted the move to routine snap inspections. ‘It’s bad news for parents that Ofsted and the Government have caved in to the unions,’ he told the Mail.

‘There are big problems with schools cheating inspections to hide bad behaviour and bad teaching. In other fields involving safety, it is basic that inspections should be no notice so that transparency catches mistakes.

‘Now, schools that get the best marks are often the ones who put on the best show – not ones that teach best. This surrender will mean lower standards and puts children at risk.’

The revelation that most schools will continue to receive notice of Ofsted visits came as part of a wider shake-up of the inspection system in England. Schools now face inspections every three years instead of every five as at present, even though, Sir Michael admitted, school performance can decline ‘very quickly’ in a matter of months.

Sir Michael said he had considered calls for routine no-notice inspections, but ‘after much thought and deliberation’ had decided against them.

Heads are currently told of an impending inspection about half a day in advance. Sir Michael insisted that one of the key criteria for triggering a no-notice inspection was concerns over safeguarding children.

The chief inspector said 40 had already been mounted this term at schools where Ofsted had concerns over standards, and there were plans for more where ‘regional intelligence’ suggested that schools were failing to protect pupils from extremism.

Denying that he was bowing to pressure from teaching unions, Sir Michael said: ‘I’m not caving in, because we are increasing the number of unannounced inspections. Is it something we might want to consider in the future? We will have a look at it.’

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘It is good news that Ofsted has decided against a move to routine no-notice inspections.’

Since taking over as Education Secretary in July, Mrs Morgan has reversed Mr Gove’s plans to make misbehaving children go for a run as a form of punishment, and in stark contrast to Mr Gove’s bullish stance towards the teaching unions – which he termed ‘the blob’ – she has vowed to do ‘everything I can’ to reduce teachers’ workload.
