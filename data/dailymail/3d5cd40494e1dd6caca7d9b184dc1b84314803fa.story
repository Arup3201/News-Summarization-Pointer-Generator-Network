As the debate in Britain rages on over plain cigarette packaging, Australia is set to crack down further on smoking with a 50 per cent hike in the rate of tobacco tax.

The country introduced the world's harshest packaging laws when it outlawed all branding on cigarette packets except for the name of the manufacturer, printed in small type.

The packages boast graphic photographs of diseased body parts, including gangrenous limbs, and of smokers dying from cancer.

Gory: Cigarettes in Australia must carry graphic images instead of branding from the manufacturer

The British Government had pledged to introduce a similar law in the UK, but performed a U-turn last month - allegedly in response to lobbying from the tobacco industry.

Australian ministers today announced that taxes on tobacco will rise by 12.5 per cent in each of the next four years.

The country is believed to have the second most expensive cigarettes in the world behind only Norway, with the average pack costing around A$13.50 (£8).

But this will climb still higher following today's decision by treasurer Chris Bowen, who is aiming to eliminate the government's deficit.

The price of an average pack is expected to rise by A$5 over the four-year period, raising a total of A$5.3billion.

'This I know won't be universally popular with all,' Mr Bowen said. 'It's a difficult decision but a decision which is taken in the best interests of the nation.'

Since December 1, all packs of cigarettes sold in Australia have borne gruesome photographs instead of manufacturer's branding.

The Coalition Government was planning to impose the same rules in Britain, but last month decided to delay the law so officials could study how the policy works in Australia.

Labour accused the Government of being influenced by Tory strategist Lynton Crosby, whose lobbying firm has previously worked for British American Tobacco.

However, ministers have insisted that it is sensible to wait for more evidence before imposing new legislation.

The effects of the Australian law have so far been mixed - although many smokers say they are more likely to grow up, cigarette makers have not seen a significant dent in sales.

A study of 500 Australian smokers showed most believed their cigarettes were less satisfying and of lower quality than a year ago, with most also thinking more about quitting.

However, BAT said: 'There has been no noticeable impact on legal tobacco sales in the first six months due to plain packaging.'
