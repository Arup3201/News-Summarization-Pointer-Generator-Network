If the weather forecast on Thursday for Christmas Day  is anything to go by you'll need to get the sun cream out in Perth, an umbrella up in Sydney, and have no need for sunnies in Melbourne.

According to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology it'll be Perth that will enjoy Australia's best weather at Christmas with Sydney the worst and Melbourne somewhere in the middle.

Cameron Lethleane, senior forecaster at the weather bureau, explained that it'll be a bit of a mixed bag over the next three days, but it was clear who was going to be celebrating Christmas Day on the beach this year.

'I think they’ll be pretty happy with the weather in Perth as it’ll be sunny and 32 degrees. It’s the pick of the bunch. It should be sunshine throughout. It’ll just be fine, sunny weather there as you’d expect,' Mr Lethleane said.   

'The other thing is it can also get very hot there but this won’t be the case over Christmas.' 

It'll be beach weather in Perth but it'll be best if you stay at home in Sydney. 

A strong weather trough inland from northern Australia through to inland parts of Queensland and New South Wales will generate showers and storms through the north and the north-east of the country, with Sydney getting the brunt of it.

Enjoying yourself in good weather is what Christmas in Australia is all about  

Sydney: 31 degrees with showers and thunderstorms

Melbourne: 22 degrees and cloudy

Canberra: 30 degrees and sunny spells

Brisbane: 30 degrees and cloudy

Cairns: 31 degrees and sunny spells

Adelaide: 20 degrees and showers 

Perth: 33 degrees and sunny

Darwin: 34 degrees with showers and thunderstorms

Hobart: 21 degrees with showers 

'This bad weather will continue over the Christmas period. Sydney in particular will have unsettled conditions with showers and thunderstorms. You could well be looking at a wet Christmas Day in Sydney. It’s not looking great there definitely,' Mr Lethleane said.  

A series of cold fronts in the south-east of the country will also bring cool weather to Melbourne and Tasmania. 

'Melbourne will be fairly mild but cloudy throughout, with the odd chance of showers over Christmas,' Mr Lethleane said.

In other areas, some showers are forecast in Cairns with a temperature of 33 degrees. Brisbane should be cloudy and 30 degrees, and Canberra can look forward to 30 degrees with sunny spells. 

Adelaide's weather should be 20 degrees with showers. While up in the tropics like Darwin it’ll be 34 degrees with showers and thunderstorms, which is typical for this time of year.
