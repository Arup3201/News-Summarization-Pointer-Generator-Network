Cash-strapped families should not waste their money on organic food because they think it is healthier, the government has warned.

Shoppers should instead spend their money on whatever they can afford, even if it means eating tinned or frozen vegetables which are in no way ‘nutritionally inferior’.

The government now faces calls to end £20million of subsidies to organic farming, which owes ‘more to myth than evidence’.

Critics want the government to end its £20million funding for the organic industry, arguing it does nothing to improve the health of the nation 

A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 per cent more antioxidants than non-organic crops.

But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic is a healthier option.

Amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables, the government is at pains to stress that families feeling the pinch should not waste their money on organic.

Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said: ‘It can be difficult balancing a family budget, but in providing a varied, balanced diet nobody need feel they have given their family a nutritionally inferior diet by choosing lower-priced, conventional products.’

Just 30 per cent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day.

Among the lowest income groups, just 24 per cent of adults manage their Five-A-Day.

Baroness Jolly added: ‘All fruit and vegetables count toward this, whether fresh or frozen, dried or canned, organic or not.

‘There is no evidence to suggest that there is a nutritional premium in some forms above others.

‘Frozen vegetables, for example, are as valuable as fresh in meeting our 'five a day'.’

The government encourages mothers who receive Healthy Start vouchers for fruit and vegetables ‘to get the best value for their vouchers, but we would not expect them to prioritise organic products’.

She added: ‘Organic products provide a useful extension of consumer choice, but it is worth emphasising that, nutritionally, they are no better and no worse than conventional products.’

She said the only benefits of organic farming were enjoyed by ‘birds, insects, mammals, plants and fungi’.

‘It is up to the consumer to decide how they spend their money on their fruit and veg. There are many reasons why an individual might wish to choose organic products but nutritional benefit should not be one of them.’

The comments came in a debate in the House of Lords, in which Lib Dem peer Lord Taverne tore into supporters of the organic movement which ‘owed more to myth than evidence’.

He said early enthusiasts included Rudolf Steiner ‘had crazy ideas such as planting according to phases of the moon’ and even Adolf Hitler ‘was completely sold on organic farming’.

Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said there were many reasons why people might buy organic, but 'nutritional benefit should not be one of them'. Lib Dem Lord Taverne said organic has become a 'kind of religion that is impervious to scientific evidence'

Lord Taverne added: ‘For some, the organic movement is still a kind of religion that is impervious to scientific evidence.’

Claims that it is free of pesticides ignore the fact that levels in non-organic food make little difference to health, he said.

‘One cup of coffee contains more carcinogens than you would ingest from a whole year’s consumption of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables. Of course, that should not stop you drinking coffee.’

He called for Defra to make an important change of policy. ‘It should stop spending more than £20 million a year on subsidising farmers to change to organic farming.’

The money should instead be spent on plant science research, he said.

Tory peer Viscount Ridley said: ‘Study after study has failed to find a significant benefit from organic foods. This latest study, although admirably diligent and a perfectly respectable meta-analysis, is no exception.’

‘The health benefits of organic food, if they exist at all, are immeasurably small. ‘The science is therefore becoming very clear that many people who buy organic food because they think it is healthier for them must be wasting their money. It would be good if they were informed of that.’

However, the Soil Association said the study in the British Journal of Nutrition showed their were benefits to eating organic.

Chief Executive Helen Browning said: ‘We know that people choose organic food because they believe it is better for them, as well as for wildlife, animal welfare and the environment, and this research backs up what people think about organic food.

'In other countries there has long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the benefits of organic food and farming: we hope these findings will bring the UK in line with the rest of Europe, when it comes to both attitudes to organic food and support for organic farming.'
