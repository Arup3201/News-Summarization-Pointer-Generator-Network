Kevin Pietersen joined IPL side Sunrisers Hyderabad for around £210,000 as all three English players to take part in this year's competition were signed by the same franchise.

Pietersen, who was released by the Delhi Daredevils last season, has seen his value tumble, but is still the most expensive English player to be signed.

Last season Pietersen cost £900,000, but he scored just one half-century in 11 matches as the Daredevils finished bottom of the table.

Ravi Bopara and captain Eoin Morgan will join Pietersen at Hyderabad, after attracting bids of around £105,000 and £157,000 respectively.

Bopara tweeted his delight at joining his compatriots in the IPL along with Sunrisers stars Dale Steyn and David Warner, who will remain with the franchise for this year's competition. 

The other two English players in the auction, Alex Hales and Michael Carberry, both went unsold. 

The most expensive signing of the day was Yuvraj Singh, who was bought for an IPL record bid for the second year in a row.

Singh cost Delhi around £1.7million, as last season's weakest team went on a spending spree that also saw them pick up Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Matthews for £780,000, and young Indian batsman Shreyas Iyer for £270,000.

Iyer has impressed in Indian domestic cricket this season, but has never played for his country and has made just three professional T20 appearances.

Alongside unknown spinner Kishan Cariappa, also 20 years old, who went for £250,000 to Kolkata Knight Riders, Iyer was the surprise package of the auction.

Australian fast bowler Sean Abbott, whose delivery led to the death of Phillip Hughes, was signed by Royal Challengers Bangalore for £105,000.

Some of the biggest names in world cricket were left without a franchise however, with the likes of Hashim Amla, Kuma Sangakkara, Ross Taylor and Mahela Jayawardene all going unsold.

The IPL begins in April, with player trades allowed for the next two weeks.
