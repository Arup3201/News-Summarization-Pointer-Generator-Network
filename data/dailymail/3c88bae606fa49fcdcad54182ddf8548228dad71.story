Two lucky divers have escaped an up-close encounter with a four-metre shark, spotting the mammoth creature swimming next to their boat just as they were preparing to enter the water.

Dustin Blesse and Adrian Blundell were on a boat in Newcastle Harbour, in NSW, when the shark swam up to their three-metre vessel on Tuesday.

Footage of the encounter shows the shark pausing slightly as it approaches the boat, and then swimming underneath and emerging on the other side.

Mr Besse, 31, is heard to exclaim loudly, 'Holy s***!', as he captures the enormous shark approaching the boat.

His diving partner, Mr Blundell, is shown to be in full diving gear, including a wetsuit and mask.

Mr Besse askes him, 'You want to get in?', to which Mr Blundell shakes his head emphatically.

Mr Besse, an experienced diver, said that the pair took off their diving equipment and waited before heading back in. 

'We saw it again and didn't see it and we waited about two hours and I ended up going in and finished the job off,' Mr Besse told The Sydney Morning Herald.

The men both work for diving company Harbourworks, and are used to the fact that sharks are often in the water.

'It is not as if they are just there today, they are always there. We do a lot of work in the harbour where there is zero visibility - if you can see your hand, it is a very good day,' Mr Besse said.

Divers from the Harbourworks company had discussed the fact of sharks on Tuesday said owner and operations manager Dave Purser.

The talk came after Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara, 41, was killed in a tragic shark attack at popular surfing spot Shelly Beach on New South Wales' north coast on Monday.  

The surfboard technician, was reportedly sitting on his board just 10 metres from shore near four other surfers  when the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - attacked.

Authorities resumed their search for the shark using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis on Tuesday as beaches between South Ballina and Lennox Head remain closed and lifeguards are patrolling to ensure swimmers stay out of the water.

It has now emerged footage of the incident, which happened just before 8am local time, was captured by Coastalwatch's surf cam

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia just after the incident happened, a worker from the Australian Hotel in Ballina said the man worked at Websters Surfboards on the outskirts of the city and was an avid surfer.

The victim lost both his legs and the other surfers brought him to shore where they tried to tend to his injuries and administered CPR, but he lost too much blood and was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Ballina Mayor David Wright said a shark expert from the Department of Primary Industries was heading to Ballina to investigate.

The surfers who were with Mr Nakahara described the shark as being three to four metres long, Cr Wright told ABC Radio.

'It came up behind and took his board and his legs and that's a horrible thing to happen,' he said.

Cr Wright said the water was warm and a lot of fish were feeding close to the surface which can attract sharks.

'The fish are travelling through and the predators ... come in and try and get it - there were lots of dolphins there yesterday going through, seven or eight, attacking the fish too,' he said.

Cr Wright believes the chances of finding the shark were quite remote.

Mr Nakahara was from Japan but had been living in the area for a number of years. He has been formally identified and police are working with the Japanese consulate to inform his family of his death.

Local residents lay flowers at the beach where the Japanese surfer was killed by a shark. Authorities closed the beach, near Ballina in northern NSW

On Monday, Detective Inspector Cameron Lindsay said a witness had been filming the beach at the time but said the footage appeared to have been taken after the attack.

'At this stage we don’t believe we have video of the actual attack,' Det Insp Lindsay said.

'What it appears to capture is a large amount of blood in the water.'

Friends of the man told local cafe owner, Karen, the shark came out from nowhere.

'It just came up between a bunch of surfers,' she told AAP on Monday.

'They weren't even that far out.

'He lost both his legs.'

The victim's friends were shaken up and looked 'white as a ghost' as they carried their mate's board away from the beach, the local said. 

Authorities kept swimmers and surfers out of the water after today's fatal attack by a shark, which severed both of the man's legs 

On the day of the incident, Cr Wright said authorities believed it could be the same shark that attacked a surfer at nearby Seven Mile Beach on Sunday.

'Now the sharks had two bites, if it's the same one, we certainly have to keep our eyes on it,' he said.

Cr Wright said surf life saving helicopters, jet skis and boats were now searching for the great white.

'It's a pretty big shark so it's most likely gone,' he said.

Paramedics at Shelly Beach attempted to revive the man following the attack just before 10am on Monday but he was pronounced dead at the scene 

Three other surfers pulled the victim out of the water following the attack just before 10am on Monday and said the shark was about four metres long, the Ballina Shire Advocate reported.

'The people who pulled him out weren't all that old so we're trying to get some counselling for them,' Cr Wright said.   

NSW Life Saving Manager Andy Kent said lifeguards had been stationed at all beaches in the Ballina Shire to keep the public informed and out of the water.

'This is obviously a very serious incident and we would ask that the public follow the directions of emergency service workers and lifeguards by remaining clear of the water,' Mr Kent said.

'Our thoughts go out to the man's family and friends, who are dealing with this tragedy.'

The man's death brings the number of shark attacks to six in the past year and four in the past five months in Australia.

There have been 174 fatal shark attacks in the past 100 years and 809 attacks reported.

The beach will stay closed until authorities decide it is safe for swimmers to return to the water

Father-of-one Jabez Reitman suffered back lacerations and received stitches at Gold Coast University Hospital

This comes a day after a surfer was injured in a shark attack at nearby Seven Mile Beach when he mistook the creature for a dolphin.

Father-of-one Jabez Reitman, 35, suffered back lacerations and was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from Seven Mile Beach in Broken Head, south of Byron Bay on New South Wales' north coast.

Mr Reitman claims the shark was two to three metres long.

The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby, according to Seven News.

'I just freaked out you know, I thought it was a dolphin at first, until it (his back) started stinging,' he told Seven.

'I didn't realise that there are some pretty bad lacerations.'

The keen swimmer says he is not deterred by the suspected shark attack and is keenly awaiting his return to the water.
