Diego Costa's desire to win is so great that even in a simple training game the fiery striker will play on the edge, according to former team-mate Toby Alderweireld.

Spain international Costa came to England with a reputation as a bullish centre forward and, as plenty of Premier League defenders will attest to, the Chelsea hitman has more than lived up to the billing.

Alderweireld, on loan at Southampton, spent last season playing with the Brazil-born striker at Atletico Madrid as Diego Simeone's side claimed a famous La Liga title.

Diego Costa has been involved in numerous scuffles with defenders during the season, including a running battle with PSG defender David Luiz in Wednesday's Champions League clash

The duo will be re-united at Stamford bridge on Sunday with Southampton still in the hunt for a top-four spot, while Chelsea will be hoping to return to winning ways after they were dumped out of the Champions League midweek by PSG.

Alderweireld knows better than most what Costa is like to line up against having faced him in training and the defender is not expecting an easy ride on Sunday. 

'That's his mentality,' the Belgium international told The Sun. 'Outside the field he's totally different, he's a very nice guy, good to the supporters, never in a fight, always laughing.

'It's strange to see him change on the field, because of his desire to win.

'Even on the training pitch, just in an easy game, four against four, he's always on the line, and his desire is so big that sometimes he goes over it.

'It happened a lot at Atletico because the training was so crazy.'
