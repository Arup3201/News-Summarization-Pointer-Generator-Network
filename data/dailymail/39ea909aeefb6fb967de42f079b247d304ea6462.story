Norman Baker, the new Home Office Minister who believes MI5 covered up the murder of Dr David Kelly, will not be granted access to classified documents on counter-terrorism issues.

The Home Office told spy chiefs the Liberal Democrat conspiracy theorist will not learn their secrets, security sources said.

Whitehall officials say ministers are given security clearance on a ‘need-to-know basis’ and Mr Baker’s brief, dubbed ‘drugs and drunks’, will mean he is frozen out of security issues.

Closed book: Lib Dem conspiracy theorist Norman Baker, left, will not learn MI5 secrets. His appointment is said to have angered Home Secretary Theresa May, right

Home Secretary Theresa May was said to be ‘spitting tacks’ over Mr Baker’s appointment in Monday’s reshuffle.

Yesterday he made it clear he will try to force through a more ‘liberal’ drugs policy than pre-decessor Jeremy Browne – which could include pressing for the decriminalisation of cannabis.

The maverick minister wrote a book in 2007 claiming weapons inspector Dr Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad, while the security services hushed it up.

He has also claimed the death of former foreign secretary Robin Cook was suspicious.

Insiders stressed that only the Home Secretary sees top secret files and authorises surveillance missions.

In her absence, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers would step in.

Mr Baker yesterday insisted that he has ‘closed the door’ on his obsession with Dr Kelly. He said: ‘The work was published in 2007. I then closed the door and moved on to other things.’

But he admitted submitting Freedom of Information requests about Dr Kelly as recently as 2010.

Mr Baker added: ‘I entirely respect the work of MI5 and the security services.’

Morning after: Mrs May arrived at Downing Street for a Cabinet meeting yesterday, still reeling from the news of her new Lib Dem colleague

Fired: Jeremy Browne, a leading voice on the right of the Lib Dems, was sacked as Home Office minister to make way for Mr Baker

Jeremy 
Browne, one of the leading figures on the Liberal Democrat right, was sacked to make way for former transport minister Mr Baker.

Though he is widely seen to have been
 a hardworking and successful rail minister, senior Government sources 
expressed astonishment that Mr Baker had been promoted to a position in 
which he will be expected to work closely with the security services, 
having expressed such views.

Mrs
 May is understood not to have been given any forewarning of his 
appointment. One official said it was ‘incredible’ that the Prime 
Minister had given it the green light and suggested the Home Secretary 
would freeze him out of key meetings.

Though Mr Clegg is in charge of Lib Dem appointments to government, they all have to be signed off by Mr Cameron.

Mr Baker insisted he had moved on from his murder claims and could now work with the security services in his new job.

He
 told BBC Radio 4's World at One yesterday: 'The book was written, I did the work 
on it, I investigated as, dare I say, an investigative journalist would 
do, the work was published in 2007, I then closed the door and moved on 
to other things.

'I want to
 concentrate on my job, which is cutting crime and the Government’s 
great success on that when we got crime down by 10 per cent, dealing 
with issues where people are particularly vulnerable, such as women 
subject to domestic violence, children subject to sexual exploitation, 
tackling forced marriages, that’s what I’m concentrating on now.'

He
 denied a split with his new boss: 'I had a very friendly chat with 
Theresa last night. No, if she was [angry] I didn’t notice it. Theresa 
and I come from different places but we work together, we work 
together.'
