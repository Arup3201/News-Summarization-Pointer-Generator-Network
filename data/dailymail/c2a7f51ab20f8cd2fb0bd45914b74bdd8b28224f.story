This is the heartstopping moment a brave PCSO took on a knife-wielding robber in a supermarket before he tripped over a cake display and was Tasered by an officer.

James Lewis, 22, stormed  into the Co-op in Shrewton, Wiltshire, and demanded cash while brandishing a 10-inch kitchen knife at terrified shop workers.

He grabbed one cashier by the collar and leapt over the counter before PCSO  Will Todd confronted him and used a metal shopping basket as a shield. 

CCTV footage shows the bungling  robber smash through stacks of crates and fall backwards  over the mess he had made before he was  floored by a Taser.

Officers were at the scene within seconds because Lewis' father had contacted police to say he was concerned about his son, Salisbury Crown Court heard.

Lewis has been  jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to attempted robbery at the village supermarket.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'Two PCSOs arrived at the supermarket at the same time as Lewis.

'One of them - PCSO Will Todd - entered the store almost immediately after Lewis and managed to quickly usher other members of staff out to safety, including the man being chased.

'He then tried to disarm the suspect using a shopping basket as a shield. Two PCs then arrived, one armed with a Taser.

'Lewis was challenged by the PC with the Taser and was asked to drop the knife, he refused and so the Taser was deployed.'

CCTV footage shows the 22-year-old chasing a terrified shop worker through the supermarket before realising PCSO Will Todd was right behind him.

The PSCO then picked up a shopping basket to defend himself as the would-be robber turned on him.

Lewis then saw a female PCSO in the shop and ordered her to leave before toppling a stack of crates containing  cakes and falling backwards over the mess he's just made.

When the PCSOs retreated out of the  shop, he stood in  doorway and shouted at them while brandishing his knife.

But within moments, Lewis was floored by a Taser shot by a police officer outside, which sent 50,000 volts through his body. 

He slumped to the floor in pain and cried as he was arrested. 

A spokesperson for Wiltshire Police said: 'A PCSO had to bravely face the suspect wielding a knife and defend himself using a shopping basket.

'The suspect was disarmed and arrested. Today he was sentenced to three years in prison.

'Wiltshire Police are very proud of all our officers, doing their part to protect the public.'
