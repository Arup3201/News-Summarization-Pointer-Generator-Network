He's only two weeks old, but fluffy Felix the kitten may already have used up his nine lives after clinging on to the bottom of a lorry for almost 170 miles.

The stowaway was found underneath a container HGV when it parked up at a factory that makes made-to-measure blinds by the factory owner Andrea Cooper.

Now he’s set for a happy home life with her once he’s had some TLC at a local animal rescue centre.

Adorable: Tiny Felix the kitten was found under a lorry after travelling 170 miles

Dark eyes: The kitten was named Felix after the origin of his journey, Felixstowe

Staff there are convinced his mother may have put him in a metal box on the lorry’s chassis out of harm’s way while she went off hunting around the docks in Felixstowe, Suffolk.

But while her back was turned the 40 foot long lorry was loaded with a container and driven off to its destination in Nottinghamshire.

The delivery arrived at The Mill Factory Shop in Sutton-in-Ashfield last Wednesday, but it was only when the driver switched off the engine that staff heard the little cries of the terrified creature.

Andrea, 48, said: 'We could hear him, but we couldn’t see where he was. We tried to coax him out with some food, but we were wasting our time as he was too young to have been weaned.

'One of the lads managed to reach up inside the metal box and got hold of him and pulled him out.

'He was shaking and covered in oil. He looked like a rat. He was so frightened.

Saved: Factory owner Andrea Cooper found little Felix under the HGV

Feeding time: He is being cared for by Millwood Cat Rescue in Nottingham but is likely to be going home with Andrea

'We got some formula milk and fed him with a syringe that we had in the first aid box. Then we rang round some local rescue centres to see who could look after him.

Andrea took him to the Millwood Cattery in West Bridgford, Nottingham and staff there quickly gave him a name.

Owner Ronnie McMillen said: “It was a straightforward choice really, he was Felix who’d stowed away from the docks… Felix-stowe!

'Felix is also Latin for lucky, so that was quite apt too!

'There’s a lot of feral cats around the port and it seems that Felix’s mum must have popped him in the box under the lorry to keep him safe and dry while she went off hunting. Obviously when she came back he’d gone.

Curious: As he was located on the outside of the container Felix is thought to be a British cat

Unfortunate: Andrea said that she thinks people need to have their animals neutered to avoid the problem of strays

'If he’d been inside the container we would have had to put him in quarantine, but because he was on the lorry, well almost, everyone is satisfied he’s an Englishman!

'He’s settled in well and he’s feeding well and putting on weight so he’ll be able to leave in a few weeks. After what he’s been through he’s a little miracle.

'He’s got plenty of company here, there’s so many strays around at the moment. People need to have their animals neutered to avoid this problem, they can get financial help if they are struggling.'

Felix was cute that despite her head telling her she shouldn’t have another cat animal loving Andrea has decided she will give him a home alongside her other moggy nine-year-old Fluffy.

'I kept think I shouldn’t, but he was so cute and he went through so much to find me,' she said.

'Obviously it was meant to be, you can’t fight fate.'
