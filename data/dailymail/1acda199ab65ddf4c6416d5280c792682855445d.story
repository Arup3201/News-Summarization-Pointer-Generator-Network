There's a supermodel racing in the Glorious Goodwood Magnolia Cup so it only seems fitting that the jockey outfits are hand crafted by high-end designers.

This year, the celebrity charity race has called on renowned fashion designers Sarah Burton and Vivienne Westwood to design riding gear for the cup, which will see model Edie Campbell riding for gold.

As last year's Magnolia Cup winner and Ladies Day Ambassador, Edie, who is good friends with Cara Delevingne, will be returning once again to race for the trophy.

She will 
be joined by fellow jockey contenders such as model Tricia Simonon, 
jeweller Philippa Holland and Sunday Times writer Krissi Murison.

Speaking
 about the cup, sponsored by jewellery designer Theo Fennell, Edie said: 'I am very excited to have taken on the role 
of leading lady - I'm hoping that we can raise even more money than in 
previous years - hopefully I'll still be the leading lady at the finish 
line too!

'I
 have yet to start my training regime but I can't wait to get into full 
jockey mode, lots of riding out-of-control racehorses at 7am, surrounded
 by tiny men on big horses..'

The celebrity riders will be decked out in bespoke racing silks created by renowned fashion designers including Vivienne Westwood, Sarah Burton - who famously designed the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress and is yet to unveil her creation - Jasmine Guinness, Frost French, Beulah and Bella Freud.

The jockeys and designers will be battling it out on the track in aid of two special charities, The Reading Agency and Best Beginnings. 

Edie, 24, shot to fame after starring in a Burberry campaign alongside Kate Moss. She has since gone on to work for Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Alexander McQueen, and Louis Vuitton.

As one of Karl Lagerfeld's favourite models, Edie closed the Chanel SS12 couture show as the bride - a coveted role in the industry.

Jewellery designer Theo Fennel saidl:  ‘I am thrilled that we are the Official Presenting Partner for Glorious Goodwood’s Magnolia Cup and to have designed the prizes for the race.

'I look forward to shouting my support from the safety of the rails for the brave line up of Ladies who will compete to be crowned Magnolia Cup winner 2014!'
