It is the sort of advert to strike fear into any woman. 

Wanted: Female body double for Sienna Miller. Must have the same body measurements as the Hollywood actress – give or take a centimetre.

But that hasn’t stopped a hopeful production company putting out a very detailed request that includes, and reveals, every one of Miss Miller’s impressive vital statistics.

Specifics: Applicants must meet a strict criteria including measuring 5ft 6in, have a 25½in waist, a high hip of 35, low hip of 36½ and be prepared to cut their hair into a messy bob, so they look like Sienna Miller

Would-be Siennas hoping to appear in an advert for bottled water should be 5ft 6in in height and have a 25½in waist, the advert states.

Their ‘low hip’ measurement should be 36½in while their ‘high hip’ should come in at 35in. Those afflicted with bingo wings will wince at Miss Miller’s ‘top arm’ circumference – a sparrow-like 10in.

The casting request even gives details of the 33-year-old’s head and wrist circumferences.

The hopeful extra must not have tattoos or body piercings and must be prepared to cut her hair into a messy bob, just like Miss Miller’s.

And, if measuring up to these remarkable standards is not enough, the successful stand-in must also be an expert in yoga.

According to the casting call, the advert, for Austrian water brand Vöslauer, will star Miss Miller and feature a group of girls ‘having a laugh while they perform very hard yoga moves in a private class’. 

The commercial ‘uses the effortless and feminine elegance of the girls to personify the true spirit of Vöslauer’.

Flexible:  On top of having the right measurements, applicants must be be able to do a host of yoga moves like the bridge (pictured)

Sought-after position: Sienna Miller wannabees should be good at yoga stances including the scorpion 

Moves: As well as having the right measurements and being prepared to chop their hair into a messy bob, applicants must also be able to do yoga moves including the side crow (left) and lotus (right)

Candidates are required to demonstrate their yoga skills in the audition, with filming due to start in London shortly.

Required yoga poses include the ‘side crow’, where the stand-in must balance on his or her forearms. 

The clones are also required to demonstrate the ‘bridge’, ‘lotus’, ‘warrior’, ‘wild thing’ and the ‘scorpion’, which sees the legs curl over the head in a potentially hospitalising move.

The fee for the body double is set at just £500.

Curiously, however, a separate casting call for the same advert, this time for a male yogi required to do the same moves but without looking like Miss Miller, sets the fee at £1,500.

Vöslauer Water, Austria’s answer to Evian, bills itself as coming from the country’s ‘oldest fountain of youth’. 

The spring is said be more than 20,000 years old and to have its source 2,000ft underground.

Previous adverts for the brand have featured fellow Hollywood actress Keira Knightley and models Claudia Schiffer, Cindy Crawford and Agyness Deyn.
