World Cup winner Christoph Kramer has revealed he cannot remember the first half of the final between Germany and Argentina after he was forced to come off following a collision.

The 23-year-old German continued playing for 14 minutes in the first half of the final at the Maracana Stadium after taking a heavy blow to the face in a collision with Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay.

He was eventually replaced in the 31st minute after slumping to the ground with what the German football federation has said was suspected concussion.

The Bayer Leverkusen midfielder has now said he cannot remember any part of the first half of the game which Germany eventually won 1-0.

Speaking to German newspaper Die Welt, as cited by The Independent, Kramer said: 'I can't really remember much of the game.

'I don’t know anything at all about the first half. I thought later that I left the game immediately after the tackle.'

Kramer said he had no recollection of how he got to the changing rooms, and all he could remember was the second half of the match.

The incident was the latest in a series of head injuries at the World Cup that raised questions about sideline medical checks.

Kramer appeared to be disorientated as he was helped off the field by medical staff.

'I can't remember very much but it 
doesn't matter now,' he said, shrugging off the injury. 'I have to send 
regards to my grandmother. She has a birthday today and I couldn't reach
 her.'

There were worrying head injuries for players earlier in the tournament.

Argentina players Javier Mascherano and Pablo Zabaleta also played on in their team's semi-final against the Netherlands in Sao Paulo after hard knocks to the head.

Mascherano appeared to be completely disorientated and fell to the ground after a clash of heads with a Dutch player. Both Mascherano and Zabaleta started in the final.

Questions about FIFA's concussion protocol were initially raised in the group stage of the World Cup when Uruguay defender Alvaro Pereira refused to leave the field after being hit in the head by an England opponent's knee.

Pereira lay motionless for a short while and appeared to be briefly unconscious, but was still allowed to come back onto the field and continue playing.

Germany went on to win the final 1-0 to become champions for the fourth time

Uruguay team doctor Alberto Pan initially made hand signals for a substitution but then seemingly changed his mind after the clearly dizzy player furiously protested.

The images provoked criticism from professional players' union FIFPro, head injury specialists and others. Pereira later said the blow knocked him out and 'was like the lights went out.'

'I was also not happy with that situation. I must confess that,' said Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.

The incidents have led to debate over whether FIFA should allow a temporary substitution so a player can get a head injury properly checked.
