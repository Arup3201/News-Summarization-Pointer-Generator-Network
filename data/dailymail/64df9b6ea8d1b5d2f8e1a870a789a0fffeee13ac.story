It's been a difficult year for Joe Hockey and it's not about to get any easier. 

The treasurer is expected to reveal revenue has taken a further hit of $6.2 billion in just over six months as he explains  why his federal budget has deteriorated more than forecast at the time of its release in May.

Mr Hockey, who will deliver his midyear economic update on Monday, has promised he won't be making any significant budget cuts amid reports of a forecast of $379.5 billion in receipts following a figure of $385.7 billion in May.

The outlook will point to tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue over the next four years as a result of falling commodity prices, according to Fairfax Media.

The Australian reports deficits over the period will almost double to $100 billion, signalling little hope of economic improvement without unpopular reforms to taxes and spending.

Mr Hockey warned on Sunday of job losses and an end to Australia's prosperity ahead of the update, with plummeting iron ore prices the chief cause.

Prices have dropped to $60 a tonne - halving in a year - with the resultant fall in the terms of trade the largest since records were first kept in 1959.

'If we don't use the budget as a shock absorber for this extraordinary fall in the terms of trade, then Australians will lose jobs and we will lose our prosperity,' Mr Hockey said.

Falling income tax revenues from rising unemployment and weak commodity prices are to blame for the huge dent in the government's finances.

There's also been some slippage in budget savings, including concessions to get the abolition of the mining tax through the Senate and tinkering with yet-to-be-legislated measures in a bid to make them more palatable.

The mid-year economic and fiscal outlook will contain Treasury's latest economic forecasts.

They come at a time when a growing number of economists are tipping interest rate cuts in 2015.

Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan is expecting two cuts to the Reserve Bank's cash rate, already at a record low.

'There is no doubt that growth is very uneven at the moment,' he says.

The recent national accounts showed a sombre economy running below three per cent and putting upward pressure on the unemployment rate.

The jobless rate struck a 12-year high of 6.3 per cent in November, above Treasury's forecast of 6.25 per cent for mid-2015.

National Australia Bank economists now expect the rate to peak at 6.75 per cent.

On the up side, inflation is expected to remain benign thanks in part to the government's scrapping of the carbon tax, which has triggered a fall in electricity prices.

Deficits over the period will almost double to $100 billion, signalling little hope of economic improvement without unpopular reforms to taxes and spending

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told ABC radio that despite Labor attacking the government for being too pessimistic in its forecasts, 'it turns out we weren't aggressive enough in downgrading the revenue assumptions that we inherited'.

He confirmed the government wasn't going to chase the fall in revenue.

The ABC reported the foreign aid program would be slashed in Monday's budget update.
