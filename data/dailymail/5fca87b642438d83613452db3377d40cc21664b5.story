It was once considered simple manners but now opening a door for a woman might see her call security, according to Sir Terry Wogan.

And after decades in the public eye, this is not the only change the veteran broadcaster, 76, has seen befall modern Britain.

Along with the death of chivalry, Sir Terry also laments the demise in quality television, celebrity culture and poor use of language.

Sir Terry Wogan, pictured, uses his latest book to complain about 100 problems with modern society 

But in his new book, The Little Book of Common Sense… or Pause for Thought with Wogan, the Radio Two presenter has laid out his advice on how to get civilisation back on track.

The ex-Eurovision host blames the ‘suffocation’ of common sense on over regulation and reality television and said people are ‘confused by too much information from the media and the internet’.

Sir Terry has never been afraid to speak his mind – he has claimed transvestite Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst turned the event into a ‘freak show’ and that presenters such as Tess Daly and Holly Willoughby will lose their jobs once their looks fade – and his book sees him be just as candid as he picks up on a series of pet hates.

In what he describes as ‘a little book of random thoughts’, Sir Terry Wogan dispenses more than 100 snippets of his wit and wisdom, on topics ranging from foxes to truth and road rage to diets. Here is a selection:

On truth: Leave plain speaking to Yorkshire men. ‘Speaking as you find’ is what’s caused most of the trouble in the world. ‘I’m only rude to people I like’, is the proud boast of someone who doesn’t understand why he hasn’t a friend in the world.

On sex: Invented in the latter part of the last century by Helen Gurley Brown and Cosmopolitan magazine. Before that, everyone was happy with romance.

On online dating: Only for the desperate. Get out more, talk to people and smile. It’s worth a try.

On Eurovision Song Contest: Nothing more clearly defines the irreconcilable difference between ourselves and our fellows in the European community. They think that it’s a feast of fine pop music. We think it’s a joke…

On celebrity: Like ‘Star’, ‘Genius’ and ‘Talent’, a word that has lost all meaning.

On public transport: I haven’t been on a bus in thirty years, and if all those empty buses clogging London’s streets mean anything, neither has anyone else’.

On in-laws: As with outlaws and byelaws, watch your step.

On relationships: Nobody knows anything. Just go for it and pray. Like life, it needs more luck that judgement.’ 

Many of the entries allude to the idea that people have become over-sensitive and, on the subject of manners, the father-of-three wrote: ‘What used to be called “good manners” is now regarded as mere affectation. Open a door for a young woman, and she’s likely to call security’.

And he saved particular ire for the modern trend to regulate, writing: ‘Along with health and safety, council regulations on waste disposal and bus lanes, brings on the hopeless shrug. However did we manage to struggle on without a proper concern for ethnic diversity, inclusivity, team spirit and the rest of the H.R. [Human Resources] brief? If ever asked what you would bring to the team, resist the urge to reply, “A new striker and the half-time oranges”’.

Sir Terry has previously criticised red tape. In 2008, he used his radio show to blast EU regulation that would supposedly force the BBC Proms – which he has presented for 18 consecutive years – to lower their noise levels to avoid upsetting neighbours.

Sloppy language also came in for a critique, particularly the propensity for people to reply to the question ‘How are you?’ with the phrase ‘I’m good’.

Sir Terry points out: ‘For Heaven’s sake! You’re not being asked about your moral behaviour, it’s a civil question about you’re health’.

But beyond simply pointing out the world’s problems, Sir Terry also used the book as an opportunity to dispense gems of advice on how to achieve an easier life.

On the topic of lies, he said: ‘Keep them little, white and simple; otherwise you’re bound to get caught out. I know you think you’re inscrutable, but believe me, your face is an open book to the rest of us’.

While he suggests avoiding exercise because, ‘in view of the indisputable fact that we all have a finite number of heartbeats, it seems foolhardy in the extreme to cause the old ticket to point away at double and treble its normal rate’.

He claims that even the best and brightest could benefit from such doses of common sense and perhaps need it more than anyone.

He commented: ‘Just as you should never confuse the law with common justice, intelligence should not be confused with common sense. Some of the brightest people in the world have no idea how to cross the road’.

This is not the first time he has published a tome of his wit and wisdom and the book follows 2009’s Where Was I?, which contained quips such as: ‘Age, they say, is only important if you’re cheese. or a wine. They also say, if you are stuck behind one on a golf course, that a tree is 90 per cent air. How come, then, that you invariably send your ball crashing into the remaining 10 per cent?’

Sir Terry, who waded into the BBC ageism row that erupted after the dismissal of Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly by saying it was ‘a little unfair but [television is] a visual medium’, has been just a scathing of how people approach age this time around.

He said: ‘Doesn’t exist any more. ‘Senior Citizen’ and ‘Silver Surfer’ are the new euphemisms. Unless you’re a female presenter on TV, in which case you’re ready for the knacker’s yard at 35.’
