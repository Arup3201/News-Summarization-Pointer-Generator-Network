Dale Cregan has pleaded not guilty to murder

Police mounted one of the largest security operations ever for a  UK court case yesterday as Dale Cregan appeared in the dock accused of shooting dead two policewomen.

He is alleged to have killed PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona  Bone, 32, in a gun and grenade attack in Hattersley, near Manchester, last September.

Up to 150 officers, many wearing black paramilitary-style clothing and body armour and clutching sub-machine guns, swamped the streets near Preston Crown Court in a lockdown security operation.

Marksmen covered the area from the top of the court and a neighbouring building, while a helicopter hovered above.

Cregan, along with other defendants, is also accused of murdering Mark Short, 23, in a shooting at a pub in May and then killing his father David Short, 46, at his home in August.

Today, as the trial got under way, dozens of armed officers descended on the city’s streets in a lockdown security operation.

Two prison vans, flanked by three police cars containing armed officers, commandeered two lanes of the M61 to transport Cregan and other defendants from prison in Manchester.

One-eyed Cregan, 29, who wore a false black onyx eye in court, is also accused of murdering Mark Short and his father David Short.

He denies four charges of murder, four of attempted murder and one of causing an explosion.

Nine others deny offences including murder, attempted murder, causing an explosion and assisting an offender.

The comprehensive security operation included the erection of two portable cabins on the steps at the entrance to the court.

Inside, airport-style security was 
employed to screen all court users, including lawyers, as they made 
their way into the building.

Once in the courthouse a large numbers of uniformed officers, some of them armed, stood on guard and patrolled the corridors.

Further checks were carried out inside the courthouse for access to Court One where the trial got under way yesterday morning.

Police sources say the security operation is one of the largest and most expensive ever mounted around a court case in Britain.

They say that by the time the trial -
estimated to last a minimum of three months - comes to an end the 
estimated cost to the taxpayer will be measured in the millions.

A senior police source said: ‘Apart 
from one or two cases, this is by far the biggest operation. The levels 
of manpower and the weaponry on display is unprecedented.

It is an astonishing display of 
force but the security surrounding this case has been the subject of a 
major assessment by various branches on the police service.

‘Such a show of force is designed to 
not only protect the public but also to ensure the safety of the 10 
defendants who are on trial.’

He said: ‘By the time this court case 
comes to a conclusion it will have cost millions but you can’t put a 
price on British justice.’

Cregan was driven from his prison cell at HMP Manchester to Preston in a convoy of vehicles that included armed officers.

Police officers were also stationed on rooftops around Preston Crown Court as the trial began

Two prison vans - flanked by three 
police vehicles - commandeered two lanes of the M61 to take the 
defendants the 40 miles to court.

The trial started before Mr Justice Tim Holroyde QC with the selection of a jury for the trial.

Seats in the public gallery have been
set aside for relatives of the police officers and the Short family, 
sitting alongside detectives who worked on the murder inquiry.

Leon Atkinson, 35, Luke Livesey, 27, 
Damian Gorman, 38, Ryan Hadfield, 28, Matthew James, 33, Francis Dixon, 
37, Anthony Wilkinson, 33 Jermaine Ward, 24, and Mohammed Ali, 26 
pleaded not guilty to a variety of offences, including murder, attempted
murder, causing an explosion and assisting an offender.
