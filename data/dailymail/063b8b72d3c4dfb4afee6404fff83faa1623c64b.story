A young cancer patient whose plight touched the hearts of the nation is well on the way to completing her final wishes, which included meeting her idol Gary Barlow.   

Stephanie Knight, 21,  has been bravely battling bone cancer since 
she was 17-years-old but learned on New Year's Day this year that her 
condition is now terminal.

So she drew up a list of things she would like to do both for herself and her family in the months before she dies.

They varied from having a fake hen night and visiting the seaside with her nearest and dearest.

Crossed off the list: Stephanie with Gary Barlow who dropped in for a cup of tea and a sing song

Her story inspired MailOnline readers and hundreds got in touch to offer their support and offer what help they could.

Now, just one month on, the nursery nurse from Hertfordshire has achieved more than she ever  thought was possible.

'It has been really overwhelming,' she told MailOnline.

'Sometimes I'm afraid to smile because I know I will just cry with happiness!'

A fortnight ago she had the rather surreal experience of having Gary Barlow singing in her living room in Braughing, Hertfordshire. The pop star had dropped in for a cup of tea and an impromptu sing song after hearing about Stephanie's story from his friend Amanda Holden.

Steph's sister, Rachael Cross, 31, told MailOnline: 'It was amazing. Gary was so normal and
down to earth. He asked Steph what she had been up to and gave her baby nephew a cuddle.

'We
told him that he needed to sing otherwise we wouldn't let him leave! He
agreed but only after we said we'd sing the chorus of Back to Good with
him.

'He had a cuppa and stayed for just under an hour. Steph was so happy, 
especially as she knew both her big sisters were such massive Take That 
fans!'

His kind-hearted bandmate Robbie Williams is currently in Los Angeles, but he sent a special note and photo to Steph after he was contacted by Sarah, Duchess of York.

The Duchess also sent a big basket of goodies for Steph's 'fake' hen night at the local pub, as well as a framed photo of a sunset she had taken in Greece. Her office is helping Steph's family to set up their own charity.

'She's been so good to me,' Steph said.

'We're hoping to meet up soon and I owe her some big thank yous.'

One of Steph's favourite days was enjoying a 'typical drunken night out' at the Ice Bar in London. They were treated like VIPs by the manager with free cocktails and a photographer on hand.

'It was a really great experience. I felt well that day, which was unusual as I often have to escape to have a rest,' Steph said.

Another experience she enjoyed was meeting the Tottenham Hotspur football team - because she loves being able to treat her family.

'My brother Lloyd has been a Tottenham fan since he was little. He's 25 but he turned into a hormonal teenager when he met them!' she said.

'I loved watching his reactions. We got to see the team training and then speak to them afterwards.

'AVB (the manager Andre Villas Boas) gave Lloyd his jacket and whistle, which was a huge deal.'

Footballer Jermain Defoe said: 'It was great for us 
to meet Stephanie. She is an inspirational person and, when we saw that 
meeting us was on her wish list, we were determined to make that happen.'

Stephanie has remained positive despite having trouble breathing and having to rely on a wheelchair after having a leg amputated due to the cancer. She is on a medication drip and is in nearly constant pain.

'It is difficult, for instance trying to get around the shops and having people who won't move for you,' Steph admitted.

'But now so many people have been coming up to me and saying they've read about my story and how inspirational I am.'

Her mother Cindy, 58, told MailOnline: 'Steph has been overwhelmed with the attention. Some days she will cry when she receives a kind message. She says: "I'm just the luckiest girl in the world." And I say to her: "but Steph, you have cancer and you're going to die." And she replies: "yes, but look at my life right now."

'She has always wanted very little and likes to help others. She has been emailing a girl in Northern Ireland, who sent her a thoughtful gift despite going through a tough time herself.  This girl says Steph has taught her so much.'

Steph has also ticked off other wishes including meeting the magician Dynamo who amazed her with his card tricks and completing her childcare qualifications.

Mrs Knight said: 'Steph has been teaching as a nursery nurse nearby. It's what she's wanted to do from the age of 11.

'She does one-to-ones helping them 
with their reading and writing. She is often given the more challenging 
ones as she has a way with her that they really respond to. Spending time in the school makes her feel normal.'

Another rite of passage Steph has now
experienced was her own fake hen night, replete with 44 female friends 
and family and some topless waiters.

Mrs Knight said: 'It went really well and everyone was saying the next day that it was the best 
one they had ever been to.

'The
Dreamboys were fabulous, they sent two lovely guys who looked after us 
all night long and served us cocktails and did a show. We had special 
T-shirts printed and played lots of silly games.'

Steph wrote on Facebook: 'I would like to thank Deb and all her staff that put
on a great night and for everyone that came to my no hen hen do i had a
fantastic time and without crying i love you all so much and i don't 
know what i'd do without you x x x.'

Steph is currently receiving chemotherapy at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. She and her family will be given a timeline of how her condition will progress in April but for now they have been told to do things from the list as soon as possible.

So on Saturday Steph is going to London to see the musical Wicked and is meeting Ben Freeman, who plays the lead Fiyero, for afternoon tea.

Next
week she, her mother and friend Lily, are going to Lifehouse Spa Hotel in Essex. They are also planning a trip to Westfield with a personal shopper and a family holiday to Chichester thanks to an anonymous gift from a premiership footballer.

Mrs Knight said: 'It's important for us that no matter how long Steph has left she fills each day with things that make her happy.

'But I am a parent and when I go to bed I do think about how one day our life will be so different without her.

'I'm so very proud of her. She is remarkable in every way.'

Steph met Gary Barlow and received a special message from Robbie Williams

Steph is now setting up a charity, called Steph's Wishes, after receiving so many donations via her website. It will help 18 to 24-year-olds who have cancer, especially those who have relapsed.

'The first time you have cancer who go in so positive,' Steph said.

'But the second time you know what's coming and you start to question whether the treatment will work as it didn't the first time.

'I want the charity to fund bucket list wishes whether it's a day out or to meet someone special.'

The wishes yet to be fulfilled on her 
list include meeting the Manchester United football team with her father Steve 
and Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Steph is now planning a special day out for her parents for their 22nd wedding anniversary and is putting together photobooks for her family.

And despite all the hardships she has been through she says she wouldn't have changed anything.

'I'm a better person because of this and we're closer as a family,' she said.

'We shrug off the small things now as they don't matter. We take lots of pictures and laugh.

'If I could give one bit of advice I would say don't take life so seriously. Just try and enjoy every minute of it.'
