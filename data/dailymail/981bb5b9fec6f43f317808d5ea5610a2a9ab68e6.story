A mother ordered to stop breast feeding in a swimming pool because staff found it 'offensive' has received a payout from the leisure centre.

Sophie Howes, 27, decided to feed her hungry eight-month-old daughter Connie when she started to get restless.

The mother-of-two sat down on the steps of the learner pool and began to breast feed the toddler in a bid to calm her down.

Within seconds the centre manager Kim Walters came up to her and ordered her to move after the lifeguard reported that she had been 'offended'

Miss Howes reluctantly said she would go to the side of the pool but was ordered to go to the changing room if she wished to continue feeding Connie.

The midwife, from Ashford, Kent, said staff made her feel 'embarrassed' and 'humiliated'.

She claimed the centre had breached the Equality Act 2010, which provides protection for women wanting to breastfeed their children.

And now Miss Howes has received an undisclosed pay out from the Ashford Leisure Trust, who run the Stour Centre, after they agreed an out of court settlement.

The centre's management said there had been 'no intention to discriminate' against Miss Howes and said the incident was result of a 'misunderstanding.'

They said they 'apologised' for any distress caused.

She said: 'I decided to take a stance as I believe no woman should be made to feel embarrassed by wanting to breastfeed their child in public.

'Women have rights to be protected from less favourable treatment and to equal access to facilities just because they want to breastfeed their children.

'It's important that when this kind of thing happens we challenge the practices and policies of services providers to ensure it doesn't happen again to others.'

Lucy Angus, from Unity Law, represented Ms Howes and said many women aren't aware of their rights.

She said: 'This case is important as it gives breastfeeding mums the confidence to know they can challenge discriminatory treatment of this kind.

'Many breastfeeding mums aren't aware of their rights in the same way service providers, such as leisure centres, aren't aware of their legal obligations.

This case helps to raise awareness of the issue from both perspectives.'

Stopping a woman from breastfeeding in public is specifically outlawed by the Equality Act 2010, pictured

Emma Wood, chief executive of Ashford Leisure Trust, said: 'Ashford Leisure Trust fully supports breastfeeding at all its sites and understands the legal rights of mothers to do this.

The Equality Act 2010 is a piece of litigation that protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society.

Under the Act it is against the law to discriminate against people who are pregnant or who have a child.

People are protected when using a public service - such as a swimming pool in this case.

According to the Act discrimination includes the following:

'On this occasion it was believed there was a legitimate health and safety risk - ie, feeding actually taking place while both the mother and baby were in the water, and a suitable alternative area just a couple of metres away was suggested.

'We do of course apologise for any upset caused. The staff were concerned for the health and welfare of the baby.

'It may be that this concern was misplaced due to a misunderstanding of the situation but it was not intended to discriminate against the mother.

'It is clear that additional training is required and this is being arranged with Public Health for all staff to ensure there is an enhanced awareness and understanding of breastfeeding.

We will also be working with experts and professionals to ensure that a suitable policy is produced.'

Miss Howes said she is 'delighted' with the result and hopes other mothers won't be discriminated against in the way she was.

Miss
 Howes, whose daughter Connie is now 15 month-old, said: 'I am really 
pleased but I am more pleased about the wider implications of it.

'The implication is that mothers won't be discriminated against in other places.

'My mum is a staunch advocate of breast feeding too and we are both midwifes. We both carried on and tried to make a difference.

Miss Howes said she was pleased she won her case because it secured extra rights to breastfeed their children in public (picture posed by a model)

Ms Howes, left, reached an out-of-court settlement after she claimed she had been discriminated against under the Equality Act 2010 when she was prevented from breastfeeding her daughter Connie, centre.

'I mean this has been happening all over the UK and I'm delighted to be able to set a precedent.

'I used to think people looked positively at breast feeding but then this happened to me and I heard of a lot of similar cases in the press.

'The feeling I got was that breastfeeding was okay as long as you do it secretly which I don't think is acceptable.

'I think there now needs to be a change in the law and make it a criminal offence to tell somebody they can't breastfeed.

'At the moment if somebody asks a person to leave then what can they do. If it's a criminal law then they can tell the police.'
