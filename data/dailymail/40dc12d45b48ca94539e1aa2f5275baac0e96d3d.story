Hero? Thomas Dolan, 19, was praised for his bravery but has now been convicted of robbery

A teenager who was given a reward for chasing down a robber in the street has been jailed just weeks later for committing robbery himself.

Thomas Dolan was praised by a judge at Gloucester Crown Court last month for his selfless act of bravery, and awarded £250 from public funds.

But yesterday he appeared in the same court to be sentenced to two years' detention for attacking a delivery driver in a drunken rage and stealing from him.

The 19-year-old was forced to give his £250 reward to the victim as compensation for the brutal robbery.

On March 2, Dolan was congratulated in court for chasing after and catching a man who had stolen £10 from a woman after she withdrew it from a cash machine in Gloucester city centre.

Judge William Hart said that the teenager had put himself in harm's way for the good of a stranger, and gave him a reward from the Sheriff of Gloucestershire's fund.

But it has now emerged that Dolan had previously been arrested on suspicion of robbing fast food deliveryman Abdul Seer in a residential street in Gloucester.

When he pleaded guilty to the crime yesterday, judge Jamie Tabor said: 'It would be hard to find a more citizenly and public-spirited action than the one you took a few months ago.

'But then you ambushed a food delivery man outside your house and subjected him to an extremely unpleasant sustained assault with your fists and your feet.

'Your actions that night were inexplicable - an enigma, a complete puzzle.'

Susan Cavender, prosecuting, said a call had been made to order food from a takeaway late at night which was later found to have come from Dolan's phone.

When Mr Seer went into the front yard of the house where the delivery was ordered he was attacked by Dolan, who punched him in the face and shouted at him to give him the food.

'Mr Seer was then punched a number of times, and the defendant also kicked him when he was down on the ground,' she said.

'He shouted to Mr Seer to stay on the ground and took the food and made off. But Mr Seer saw him go into a nearby house and when police arrived on the scene he directed them to it.

'The defendant ran off through gardens, but he was arrested nearby.'

Mr Seer was taken to hospital and suffered continual headaches and other complications for two weeks afterwards, said the prosecutor.

He was also scared of being targeted again, and worried he would lose earnings while he was unable to work.

Dolan told police he had drunk eight or nine cans of strong lager before carrying out the attack.

Defending, Sarah Jenkins said the teenager's actions had been a moment of madness which was completely out of character.

'He is not a violent young man and there is no suggestion that this kind of violence has ever been exhibited by him before,' she said.

'He was significantly under the influence of alcohol. He does not normally drink much but is a classic binge drinker.

'He knows that now and since this incident he has not touched alcohol at all and intends never to drink again.'

Mr Tabor sentenced Dolan to two years in detention and ordered him to pay a £100 victim surcharge as well as the £250 compensation.
