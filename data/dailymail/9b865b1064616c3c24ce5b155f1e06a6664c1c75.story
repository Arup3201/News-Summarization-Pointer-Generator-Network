Chloe Madeley revealed today that she ‘wanted to stand up against’ vile Twitter trolls as she was seen in public for the first time since they threatened to rape her.

Online bullies turned on the 27-year-old after her mother Judy Finnigan sparked a storm this week by saying rapist footballer Ched Evans had not physically harmed the teenager he attacked.

Her father, TV presenter Richard Madeley, warned the trolls that ‘prosecution awaits’ for making rape threats against her daughter after she stepped in to defend the controversial comments.

And fitness instructor Miss Madeley told BBC Newsbeat today: ‘I always ignore the disgusting troll tweets I get because I honestly do not want to give them any attention.

‘But the tweet in question took it to another level and I wanted to stand up against it this time.

‘However, now that I've done that, I don't want to tempt vicious attention seekers with the rewards of media attention. So I won't be saying anything more.’

Finnigan this week inflamed a debate about whether Evans should return to his footballing career by claiming his crime was ‘non violent’ and did not cause ‘bodily harm’, during a TV panel discussion.

Her comments on ITV's Loose Women caused a wave of criticism and also sparked threats against her daughter. Mr Madeley tweeted: ‘Trolls who sent sick rape threats? Prosecution awaits you.’

He added that he had noted every troll threat, and those who threatened rape on her were in ‘deep trouble’. Scotland Yard said they were not aware of any complaints made to police.

Writing in the Daily Mail today, Miss Madeley revealed her mother had been upset and unsettled when she told her of the tweets. 

She added that the fact such threats can be issued to people on social media is ‘extremely chilling’ and ‘extremely cowardly’.

Miss Madeley, who described herself as a huge fan of Twitter and a strong advocate for the right to free speech, said she felt violated by the threats and considered those behind the tweets to have crossed a line into criminality.

‘How can it be right for someone to issue a rape threat to a young women and think it acceptable?’ she wrote. She confirmed that her father will be reporting those who sent the tweets to the police.

Finnigan apologised after the show, in which she also said the Sheffield United striker's 19-year-old victim had ‘far too much to drink’ prior to the ‘unpleasant’ attack in a hotel room.

The presenter, who was making her debut on the show, said: ‘I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used.

‘I absolutely wasn't suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and, as I said on the programme, I was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result.

‘The point I was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time?’

Among those who criticised the TV presenter over her comments was Northumbria police and crime commissioner Vera Baird.

Her father, 58-year-old Richard, said he had 'noted' every troll's threat to Chloe, adding: 'They're in deep trouble'

‘No bodily injury has little relevance, it doesn't have to do physical damage to be rape and it is the essence of violence to force himself upon her,’ she said.

Regarding the victim being drunk, Mrs Baird added: ‘What has this got to do with this if he forced himself upon her?

‘If you get drunk and someone steals your wallet, does this mean it's any less of a theft than if you were sober?

‘He has to work somewhere but it probably shouldn't be in such a public role since it looks like he's being given a platform for approval.’

Evans is expected to be released from prison this week. Miss Madeley said she hopes the trolls who targeted her ‘will get their just deserts’.
