As authorities continue to search for the vanished Malaysian Airlines 777, a cyclone in the Indian Ocean is nearing the designated search area off the coast of Perth, Australia.

Although Cyclone Gillian is currently well north of the search area - about 2,500 kilometers from mainland Australia - experts continue to monitor its movement in case it bears south.

Crews searching for the missing plane have already had to contend with fog and other weather conditions as they search an area known as the 'Roaring Forties' because of its rough waters.

With 10 aircraft now in the air searching, the crews are working off images found by both Chinese and Australian satellites, according to ABC News.

Bad weather has hindered the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. While Cyclone Gillian in the northern Indian Ocean could bear down on the search area, another tropical storm has come in from the west

Tropical Cyclone Gillian was causing strong winds and rough seas in the southern Indian Ocean where ships and vessels are searching for objects spotted by an Australian satellite and possibly related to Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370

New data: This satellite image, captured by the Chinese on March 18, is of a floating object measuring about 73 feet long by 43 feet wide. It is the second debris to be found in the area after similar data was first found by Australia

The most recent - the Chinese footage, which released on Tuesday - is of an object that is floating in the ocean measuring 73 feet by 43 feet.

It is approximately 75 miles away from the object detected by the Australian satellite.

Searchers in the air have yet to find these objects or confirm they are connected to missing Flight MH 370.

Ships have also been tasked with searching the area.

What was believed to be a wooden pallet that could have come from the jet was seen by one plane Sunday, but another search plane sent to photograph it could not locate the pallet.

ABC News aviation expert and former Marine Corps pilot Steve Ganyard said even if the storm doesn't hit the search area head on, it can still affect the search effort since crew members may have difficulty identifying debris in whitecap waves churned up by a faraway storm.

Additionally, if there is debris from the plane in the ocean, a large storm could displace it, making it almost impossible for investigators to trace the debris to a crash site as they have done in earlier investigations.

ABC News aviation expert John Nance said if the cyclone develops closer to the search area it would hinder the search effort for multiple reasons, including decreased visibility and a dispersal of debris.

'If you've got floating debris and the sea scape goes from eight to 10 feet to 40 to 45 feet your chances of sinking that [debris] becomes great,' Nance said.

'The large structures that we have been seeing, if they are indeed from the airplane, are probably very vulnerable to be sunk from the cyclone.'

David Mearns, a search and recovery expert and founder of Blue Water Recoveries, said if the plane did crash into the water, weather events such as cyclones would likely not affect the crash site.

If the plane crashed where search crews are looking, Mearns said investigators would expect to find wreckage on the ocean floor that likely would be undisturbed by weather patterns thousands of feet above on the ocean surface.

'While it will have been fragmented into many, many pieces, most of that will be on the seabed,' relatively undisturbed, said Mearns.

'A classic pattern, it's probably no more than 1,500 to 2,000 meters in the longest dimension and about half as wide.'

Search crews will start the search for the vanished plane on Monday.Â 

Flight 370 vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, setting off a multinational search that has turned up no confirmed pieces and nothing conclusive on what happened to the jet.
