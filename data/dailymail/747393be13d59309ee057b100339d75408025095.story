Life of luxury: Scott Portelli, 41, manager of Swimming with Gentle Giants, said: 'I have been swimming with whales in Tonga for over 12 years'

'It's hard to describe a feeling, but from a visual perspective, we are in a vast blue environment with a 40 tonne, 18 metre long whale.

'Whales are the gentle giants of the sea and humpbacks specifically are the most charismatic, they are curious and will often seek out interactions with humans.

'I never feel in danger even though they have the ability to swipe me like a fly with their enormous tail if they wanted, but they are so thoughtful conscious of your space they will manoeuvre within inches of you.'

Magical: Mr Portelli said: 'People have come out of the water in tears after being in the water with a whale; some cry with joy and amazement, and some just can't speak as they take in the experience'

Appearances: As well as whales, other underwater life such as dolphins, manta rays, turtles, blue marlin, sharks and seals occasionally pop along to enjoy the experience

As well as whales, other underwater life such as dolphins, manta rays, turtles, blue marlin, sharks and seals occasionally pop along to enjoy the experience.

Mr Portelli added: 'People have come out of the water in tears after being in the water with a whale; some cry with joy and amazement, and some just can't speak as they take in the experience.

'It is clear that its life changing for anyone that swims with a whale, their perspective changes, and swimming with whales is addictive, I have so many returning guests each year.

'My simple aim is to raise awareness of these beautiful animals.

'The Japanese hunt 1050 whales every summer, but there is no reason for this lethal form of research.

'It
 is great being around like minded people as well as being able to bring
 joy to people that experience the whales, I couldn't imagine doing 
anything else.'

In awe: The divers float near the creature of the sea in awe
