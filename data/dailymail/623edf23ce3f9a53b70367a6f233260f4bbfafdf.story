Four activists were arrested today after scaling the gates of Buckingham Palace and chaining themselves to the railings.

Three men and one woman from the Climate Siren group locked themselves to the south centre gate just after 2pm, holding megaphones and wearing T-shirts that read: 'Climate emergency. 10% annual emission cuts'.

Two held a banner carrying a quote from the Prince of Wales reading: 'The doomsday clock of climate change is ticking ever faster towards midnight. We are simply not reacting quickly enough.'

The four were removed by police using a cherry-picker more than four hours later as officers brought the protest to an end.

They were detained at various central London police stations on suspicion of breaching Royal Parks regulations.

Other activists wearing T-shirts and carrying banners with the same message were also on the scene.

The group said they were calling on the Queen to follow her son's example in speaking out about 'the escalating threat of catastrophic climate change'.

The protest came the day after the Rio+20 global conference on sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, came to a close.

The group described their actions as 'an act of civil disobedience designed to demand urgent, concerted and meaningful action to tackle the unprecedented national and global emergency presented by the catastrophic destabilisation of global climate and timed for the day after the end of the Rio+20 Earth Summit in Brazil.'

They said they were protesting over 'the failure of the conference to achieve any meaningful results'.

In an open letter to the Queen posted on their website, Climate Siren said they wanted to see an 'upscaling of our national effort to confront the emergency'.

They said they had chosen the Palace as their location to emphasise that the issue was of 'critical importance for our national destiny' as well as for the future of the entire global community.

The letter read: 'We are calling for our nation to take strenuous, positive action both to fulfil our responsibilities as a major emitter of greenhouse gases, now and historically, and to show courage and resolution in taking a lead on the issue.

'We echo the sentiments of your son and heir, HRH the Prince of Wales...

'But we are going further because such sentiments are in danger of becoming mere platitudes if not accompanied by concrete proposals for action.'

They told the Queen she was from a generation that can remember 'another great national struggle' and wrote: 'We believe that our national security is at stake now, no less than it was during the dark days of the last Great War, albeit in a very different way.

'As you celebrate this year's Jubilee you must find it impossible not to view with consternation the dark clouds that once again are gathering to threaten the future of this island, with which your name has been so closely associated these last 60 years.

'These are the dark clouds of what looks increasingly likely to be a much greater global tragedy than the last World War.

'It is time to act - with boldness, resolution and determination - not the kind of half-hearted half-measures that we have seen up to now.

'It is time that you and all public figures with influence followed the example of your son by speaking up loudly, clearly, and unceasingly, about the escalating threat of catastrophic climate change.'

A hundred or so bystanders stood and watched the protest.

Activist Siobhan Grimes, 24, from Bethnal Green in east London, who was among those at the scene, said: 'Our politicians aren't doing enough. We're hoping to inspire people to wake up to the consequences of catastrophic climate change.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'At approximately 2.05pm on Saturday June 23, four protesters - three men and one woman - climbed the centre gate and south centre gate at Buckingham Palace and secured themselves to the railings with chains.

'Police attended and by around 6.35pm all the protesters had been removed and arrested under SOCPA (the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act) and for breaching section 4 of the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997.

'They have been taken to various central London police stations where they remain in custody.'

Charles issued his warning that action on climate change was not being taken quickly enough in a speech to the European Parliament in Brussels in February 2008.
