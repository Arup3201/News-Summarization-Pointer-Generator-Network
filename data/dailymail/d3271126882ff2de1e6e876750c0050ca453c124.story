Dutch photographer Michael Echteld took his winning photograph while in Italy. He explained: 'This image was taken on the inner court of the Pallazzo Publico in Siena, Italy. While looking straight up, the patterns and symmetry in the architecture are wonderfully amplified. The asymmetrical position of the Torre del Mangia nicely disrupts the symmetry.

A blacktip reef shark patrols the edge of a coral reef in the Seychelles in this photo taken by British photographer Byron Dilkes. Naming his image Tantalizingly Tropical, he said: 'With this image I wanted to portray as many elements of the idealistic "tropical island" as possible. The image was particularly difficult to get, as it required the right combination of tide, good underwater visibility and calm surface conditions. At low tide I waded out with my underwater housing and perched on a large rock as I waited for the tide. On this particular day I perched on the rock for about four hours until the incoming tide threatened to sweep me off my feet.'

Venezuela's Jorge Alejandro Gomez called this image More Black Than White. It was taken of a symmetrical pedestrian overpass last year after a friend invited him to participate in a challenge on Facebook that required posting a new black and white image for five consecutive days.

I rotated the picture 180degrees and added negative spaces in the lateral and upper sides.'
