Prison: Steven Quinn, 33, was jailed for six years and four months today at Bolton Crown Court for mowing down 16-year-old Callum Hilton while drunk

A driver who knocked down and killed a 16-year-old boy was so drunk he told his petrified passenger that he had only struck a bollard.

Steven Quinn, 33, was jailed for more than six years today for mowing down Callum Hilton as the youngster crossed the road in Bury, Greater Manchester.

Quinn had earlier guzzled seven pints of lager, as well as vodka and lemonade, and only left for home after bar staff refused to serve him any more alcohol.

He was driving his Peugeot 306 at speeds of up to 50mph, ignoring pleas from his passenger to slow down, when he slammed into Callum, who was on his way to a house party.

The boy was thrown 20ft through the air and suffered serious head injuries in the crash. Paramedics rushed him to hospital but he died hours later with his family by his bedside.

Speaking after her son's death, Callum's mother Tricia Hamilton said: 'Can’t sleep and don’t want to, because it all becomes a reality when I wake up after holding my son whilst he passed.'

Today at Bolton Crown Court, Quinn, from Radcliffe, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for six years and four months.

On the day of Callum's death in November last year Quinn had spent the afternoon drinking and watching football at the Heaton Park social club.

He drank up to five pints of lager there before getting behind the wheel again to visit the nearby Red Lion pub where he sank another two pints of beer and a vodka lemonade.

Staff at the Red Lion refused to serve him any more drinks after he was seen slurring his words and stumbling over bar stools. His friend Elizabeth Cox suggested they share a tram ride back to his house.

But Quinn pushed his keys into the ignition of his car and revved up the engine. 'She made the very foolish decision of getting into the car with him,' said Michael Morley, prosecuting.

Callum had also been watching the football with friends before they decided to go to a party advertised on Facebook. But on their way there they found themselves lost and Callum crossed the road to ask for directions.

He walked straight into the path of Quinn’s oncoming car.

Tributes: Friends and relatives of Callum mourn at the scene where drunken Quinn ran over while the youngster was crossing the road on the way to a party with his friends on Saturday November 3, 2012

Mr Morley said in the moments before the crash Miss Cox had been worried about Quinn’s driving, speed and concentration, so she turned off the car radio - but felt an almighty thud as she did so.

'He was driving too fast and she told him again to slow down. She felt like the radio was on in the car was very loud and distracting the driver,' Mr Morley told the court.

No chance: Callum had just walked across the road to ask for directions when he was hit by Quinn's oncoming Peugeot at speeds of up to 50mph

'She heard a noise but didn’t know what it was. She noticed that there was damage to the car and she could no longer see the driver’s wing mirror. Quinn told her, “I have hit a bollard”.

'She didn’t realise that anything else had gone on and the two drove on. Even after that noise or collision, the defendant still didn’t slow down and carried on speeding.'

Passers-by stopped to help Callum and tried to give him first aid at the scene. When Quinn got back home, Miss Cox left soon afterwards, still not realising what had happened.

Police alerted by a tip off saw the offside wing mirror of his car was missing. They arrested Quinn just before they were about to force entry to his house after he failed to answer them. He said he thought he had hit a post.

Quinn’s phone was seized and officers discovered two text conversations during which he told a friend he could not remember what happened because he was so drunk, and then later when the police turned up at his door he was ‘shaking like a leaf’.

In her victim impact statement Callum’s mother said: 'My son was a beautiful young soul. I don’t know if dying of a broken heart is possible.

'I speak to him, I imagine him as he comes in at 11pm, I imagine him walking out the gate with his head phones on, I light a candle for him at night. Our family life has been destroyed.'

In mitigation defence counsel Hunter Gray said his client opted to drink and drive after failing to get a lift to the working men’s club.

He added: 'The blame here lies solely at his door. He wishes to apologise for his behaviour.'

Passing sentence Judge Peter Davies banned Quinn from driving for six years and told him: 'It was prolonged, persistent and deliberate course of bad driving.

'You were in no condition to drive. You were very drunk, you got into your car and drove yourself and her back to your home.

'During the course of the journey your were warned several times not to drive but you continued to drive.

'Callum was walking across the road with his friends; because of your speed and intoxication, you failed to see him.'

Tragic: Callum was thrown 20ft through the air and suffered serious head injuries in the crash. He was rushed to hospital but died later in his mother's arms and with his family by his side

Detective Inspector Amber Waywell said after the case: 'Callum’s mum and grandad, who raised him, have suffered an unimaginable loss. A much-loved son and grandson has died in such terrible and tragic circumstances and our thoughts remain with the family as they attempt to come to terms with losing Callum so young.

'No words, and no sentence, can ever bring Callum back. A car can be a lethal weapon and sadly that has been borne out and robbed Callum’s family of a much-loved young man.'
