President Barack Obama plans to nominate former Proctor & Gamble executive Robert McDonald as the next Veterans Affairs secretary, as the White House seeks to shore up an agency beset by treatment delays and struggling to deal with an influx of new veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

An administration official said Obama would announce McDonald’s appointment Monday. If confirmed by the Senate, McDonald would succeed Eric Shinseki, the retired four-star general who resigned last month as the scope of the issues at veterans’ hospitals became apparent.

In tapping McDonald for the post, Obama is signaling his desire to install a VA chief with broad management experience.

McDonald also had military experience, graduating near the top of his class from West Point and serving as a captain in the Army, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division.

The administration official insisted on anonymity in order to confirm McDonald’s appointment before the president’s announcement.

Jim McNerney, Chairman and CEO of The Boeing Company, welcomed the development.

'I believe Bob McDonald is an outstanding choice for this critically important position. Following his military service, Bob spent more than three decades in business, where he rose through the ranks leading increasingly large and complex organizations by demonstrating strong management skills and by understanding and attending to the needs of hundreds of thousands of individual consumers of Procter & Gamble,' McNerney said.

Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement that he looked forward to meeting with McDonald next week to get his views on issues he views as important.

Among them,
 Sanders said in a statement, 'The VA needs significantly improved 
transparency and accountability and it needs an increased number of 
doctors, nurses and other medical staff so that all eligible veterans 
get high-quality health care in a timely manner.'

A biography of McDonald on Procter & Gamble’s website says he led the company from 2009 to 2013.

During
 that time, the company website states: 'P&G realized annual sales 
of over $84 billion. The company had more than 120,000 employees, 120 
plants and 200 brands in 35 categories, of which 25 brands generate over
 $1 billion in sales each year.'

The company’s Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and other products can be found in 98 percent of American households.

But
 under McDonald’s leadership, it struggled to grow under increased 
competition and global economic challenges. Critics suggested he was 
having trouble getting the 150-year-old-plus company to fire on all 
cylinders.

Investors,
 including activist investor William Ackman, voiced frustration over the
 company’s slow revenue growth and stagnant market share gains. Ackman, 
who took a 1 percent stake in the company, pressed for the company to 
streamline operations and improve results.

In
 a letter announcing his retirement from P&G, McDonald wrote, 'This 
has been a very difficult decision for me, but I’m convinced it is what 
is in the best interests of the company and you.

'During
 the past year, much attention has been focused on me from several 
angles, which has been a distraction that is not in our best interests,' he wrote.

In a surprise move, McDonald was replaced by the man he had replaced, former P&G CEO A.G. Lafley.

McDonald
 has also served on the board of directors of the Xerox Corp., the 
United States Steel Corp., the McKinsey Advisory Council and the Greater
 Cincinnati regional initiative intended to 'grow high-potential 
startups' in the Cincinnati region.

McDonald
 is 61. A native of Gary, Indiana, McDonald grew up in Chicago and 
graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1975 with a 
degree in engineering. He also earned an MBA from the University of Utah
 in 1978.
