A father saved his life with a doner kebab after being stabbed in the neck after buying a takeaway.

James Hobbs, 37, used the unopened £3.40 meal to stem the flow of blood after he was knifed by Jamie Edney, 36.

He lost six-and-a-half pints of blood and was left with a five-inch knife wound which missed his windpipe and jugular vein by millimetres following the attack in Highbridge, Somerset.

Doner saved my life: James Hobbs holds a kebab like the one he used to stem the blood after he was stabbed in the throat

Doctors told Mr Hobbs that holding the kebab to his neck saved his life because it gave paramedics time to rush him to hospital.

Edney was today jailed for five-and-a-half years at Bristol Crown Court after being found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Mr Hobbs, from Highbridge, had been out with his cousin to buy food before returning to his flat on January 15, 2011.

He accused his neighbour Edney of having an affair with his girlfriend - and he responded by cutting his throat.

Mr Hobbs said he held the kebab to his neck for several minutes until his cousin found a towel to cover the deep horizontal cut.

Doctors told him he was lucky to be 
alive as he needed an operation to open his windpipe so he could breathe
 and 27 staples to seal the cut.

Judge Michael Longman told Edney that he was giving him the lowest sentence possible due to the mitigating circumstances.

Judge Longman said: 'You say that Mr Hobbs lunged at you, that you raised your arms and in doing so you accidentally cut him.

'But the prosecution said effectively, in a single movement, you slashed his neck. The jury rejected your account.

'I accept that you did not go looking 
for trouble. It was not begun by you. It was Mr Hobbs who came to your 
door and he did so in a temper.

'To answer the door holding the knife was asking for trouble - you selected the knife intending to intimidate.

'I accept that you regret and didn't 
expect the injury or the outcome, but when you use a knife in the way 
you did it is perhaps only to be expected.'

Mr Hobbs has previously told how he battled to stay alive for his daughter Molly.

He claimed: 'I think subconsciously I wanted to live for Molly and just didn't want to die like that.

'I do go round with a bit of a spring in my step, knowing how lucky I am.'

Mr Hobbs and his partner Lisa Reed, 33, did not want to comment after leaving court today.

Dave Jones, 38, and Ian Anderson, 37, both also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.

The court heard that under a 'misguided sense of loyalty', Anderson and Jones had burned the clothes Edney had been wearing on the evening of the attack.

Anderson was given 160 hours of unpaid work and Jones was given 150 hours. Both were also ordered to pay £250 each in prosecution costs.
