A staggering number of complaints have been made about a series of Australian-made television ads that show men picking their nose and passing wind in their wife's cars.

The advertisements are part of a campaign by personalised number plate firm MyPlates, which looks at why women should 'man proof' their cars.

More than 350 complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Bureau in relation to the ads and MyPlates chief executive Daryl Head said the volume and ferocity of complaints 'rocked our socks off'.

A number of complaints have been made about a series of Australian-made television ads that encourage women to 'man proof' their cars after a man is filmed picking his nose and wiping it on the interior of the car

'I don’t intend to offend and the ads are not designed to get complaints and get people upset. They are designed to be funny,' Mr Head told Mumbrella.

'We haven’t done anything wrong or breached any code of conduct.

'The ferocity of the complaints has been quite upsetting. They are abusive, and the young ladies handling the complaints for me have been offended. That has rocked our socks off.'

The ads that generated complaints showed one man breaking wind and another picking his nose and wiping it across the interior of the car.

Among the MyPlate ads that generated complaints from viewers was this one where a man broke wind in his wife's car

Complaints to the Advertising Standards Bureau highlighted the sexist portrayal of men, with some suggesting that women also pick their noses and fart

Fiona Jolly, CEO of the Advertising Standards Bureau told Daily Mail Australia the majority of complaints related to the 'crass nature of the ads'.

'Complainants have highlighted their feelings of disgust at seeing a person pick their nose. Concerns have also been raised about the example the ads set for children,' Ms Jolly said.

'Other complaints have highlighted the sexist portrayal of men, with some suggesting that women also pick their noses and fart.'

Mr Head said he had been informed by the Advertising Standards Bureau that the complaints have been dismissed.

But now the process allows for complainants to lodge a request for review if they aren't satisfied with the outcome. Final case reports are made publicly available once the process is completed.

Last year, MyPlates fielded controversy after an ad with a man in his backyard 'showing a bit of bum crack' received complaints.

But Mr Head said he was not worried about brand damage to MyPlates, saying those who were offended were not in the company's target market anyway.
