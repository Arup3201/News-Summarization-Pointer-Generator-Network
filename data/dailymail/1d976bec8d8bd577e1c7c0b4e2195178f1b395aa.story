Powerboat racer Keith Whittle cheated death after crashing his boat at more than 130mph on the same lake where Bluebird speed ace Donald Campbell was killed in 1967.

Whittle had just set a new record for the Formula 2 class in his 200hp boat named Pepstar when he spectacularly flipped his speed machine on Coniston Water in the Lake District.

His boat somersaulted one a half times through the air before landing top-down on the water, in an accident witnessed by hundreds of spectators on Friday.

Remarkably Whittle escaped unscathed but shaken from the spectacular crash which happened on the same stretch of 
Coniston water that claimed the life of speed record ace Donald Campbell, who 
lost control of his Bluebird at more than 300mph in January 1967.

Campbell already held the water speed record of 276mph and was trying to beat it.

His boat was named after
the car in which his father Sir Malcolm Campbell had set what was then a
land speed record of 146mph in 1924.

Mr Whittle was taking part in the Coniston Records Week and had reached 132mph - smashing the previous best in his of 124mph.

Martin
Campbell, who witnessed the crash, said: ‘Your initial response is 
hoping the driver gets out and he did but it is still quite shocking 
when it happens.

‘On the lake you have several boats with divers on board and as soon as a boat goes over it is full throttle over to them.

Flipping over: The shocking accident was witnessed by hundreds of spectators in the Lake District on Friday

‘Most drivers carry oxygen but Keith 
didn’t need it, he managed to get out straight away. It all happened in 
an instance and he was a bit shaken up.

‘Medical
staff checked him out and he was fine, just a bit stiff. They are there
to set records and know the risks involved but everything worked out 
okay.’

Coniston Power Boat Records Week is the only event in the Powerboat Racing Calendar to bring together all classes of boat.

Survival: Medics looked over Mr Whittle following his accident in the boat, but 'he was fine, just a bit stiff'

Damage: Mr Whittle's Formula 2 class boat is pictured here after being recovered from the lake on Friday

Jim Noone, chief technical measurer, added: ‘Keith was trying hard for the record and when you’re right on the edge these things can happen.

‘But the safety element has advanced in the past ten years and crashes like this are very survivable. He was a bit shaken and a bit cold but other than that he was fine.

‘The water conditions were perfect and there were nine records set through the week and Keith had at least two of them.

‘The high speed runs are always exciting 
and you have a mixture of relief and elation - it was the last run of 
the week and certainly the most dramatic.’
