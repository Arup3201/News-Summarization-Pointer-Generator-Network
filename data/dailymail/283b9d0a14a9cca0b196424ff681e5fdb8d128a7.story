The Duchess of Cambridge was pictured wearing the new must-have toy for children - a glittery wristband now being sold on the website owned by her parents.

Carole and Michael Middleton have begun selling a product similar to Rainbow Looms through their mail-order company Party Pieces. Kate was seen wearing one during the royal tour of New Zealand.

‘Just arrived,’ it boasts in an announcement with a picture of the brightly coloured plastic rings that children make into bracelets.

Supporting the family: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was spotted wearing a loom band bracelet. Now her parents' firm Party Pieces is selling a similar product

The firm is selling the Glitter Loom band kits for £2.99 each.

‘Join the latest craze with this  multi-coloured loom band pack,’ it adds.

Sales of loom bands have rocketed by more than 300 per cent and they're now as much a fashion statement as they are a children's fad.

The simple, colourful, rubber bands, are weaved together to make friendship bracelets and have been seen on the arm of celebrities including presenter Fearne Cotton, David Beckham, One Direction’s Harry Styles and pop star Miley Cyrus.

However, the country’s largest craft retailer, Hobbycraft, has revealed that since Kate was seen wearing one during her tour of New Zealand and Australia, loom sales have gone through the roof.

So popular are loom bands, that they also occupy every top 20 spot on online retailer Amazon’s current bestselling toy chart.

The Duchess was given bracelets by two young girls during her trip in April and both she and husband Prince William wore them afterwards. Since then, Hobbycraft said sales have risen by 331 per cent.

In addition to jewellery, loom bands can be used to create various accessories and toys, including key rings, phone cases and even shoes.

Despite the success of Party Pieces, The Middletons have been accused of cashing in on their royal connections.

They were invented in the U.S. last year by father-of-two Cheong Choon Ng. Since then, his company, Rainbow Looms, has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom, crochet hook and bands – worldwide.

When Kate was pregnant their website offered miniature castles, ‘prince’ and ‘princess’ banners and balloons are among the other royal baby-themed products.

The website, set up by Carole Middleton in 1987 also offered paraphernalia themed around the Royal Wedding and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.
