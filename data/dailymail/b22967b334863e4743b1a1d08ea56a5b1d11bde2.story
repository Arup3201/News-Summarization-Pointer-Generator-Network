A warehouse worker lost two fingers when his hand was drawn into a giant woodworking machine just days after securing a full time job.

Mathew Bell, 28, suffered 'life changing injuries' after he was using a cutting machine while working for Workshop Fabrications in Nottingham. 

Mr Bell was feeding a piece of wood into the machine, which had an unguarded blade, when the accident happened.

Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard that the 28-year-old victim now has difficulties with simple tasks such as tying his shoe laces. 

The court heard that the company had adapted the Brandt Optimat KD 77-C Edgebending machine to operate without a guard protecting the blade. 

Mr Bell had been working in the workshop as an agency worker for the previous 13 weeks on the day of the accident in June 2012. 

He said: 'I was going into work full of joy because I had been given a permanent role which meant I would be paid more - but then this happened.

'It's definitely changed my life; I have to live with half a hand.

'Things I used to take for granted are now a lot harder - tying shoelaces, carrying stuff, fastening trousers, opening a door when I have something in my other hand.

'I was learning how to play guitar at the time but I had to stop and I can't type anywhere near as fast.

'It can get really frustrating but I try not to let it stop me from doing things.

'If the company hadn't modified the machine the way it did, then it would never have happened. It's ridiculous that health and safety just went out the window.'

Workshop Fabrications admitted breaching health and safety regulations by modifying the machine so it could operate without its safety guard.

Mr Bell was feeding wooden worktops into the machine which cuts them to the correct dimensions using several circular saws. 

He said: 'I was watching a board go through and the next thing I remember is panicking and pulling my hand out of this machine as it made these awful grinding noises.

'I just saw my mangled left hand with the white bit of bones where my little finger should have been and screamed.

'Whenever I think about it, I just shiver and cringe. Because it was a tooth blade, it chewed and ripped them off.'

Mr Bell, from Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham but his little and ring fingers were too badly damaged and what was left of them had to be amputated.

He also severely damaged his middle finger and says doctors may yet decide to remove it. He was in hospital for three days and off work for seven months. 

He is now taking a computer-based animation course.

An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive found the blade had been unguarded since 2008 or 2009.

Health and Safety Executive inspector Judith McNulty-Green said in a statement: 'This man's painful and life-changing injuries were borne out of a catalogue of failings on the part of Worktop Fabrications Ltd.

'The risks associated with cutting machinery are well known in the industry, and so are the measures that should be taken to minimise or remove those risks.'

Emma Evans, defending at Nottingham Magistrates Court on Friday, said the firm previously had a clean record and had since made changes to reduce risks.

She said: 'The company accepts it relied too heavily on verbal instructions to staff.'

Worktop Fabrications was ordered to pay a £20,000 fine, £4,754 legal costs and a £15 victim surcharge after pleading guilty to breaching Regulation 11(1) of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998.

A company statement said: 'The company regrets the events which led to the prosecution and since has taken steps to ensure that an accident of this nature does not happen in the future.'
