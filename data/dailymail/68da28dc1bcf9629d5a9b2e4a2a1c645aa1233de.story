Slippers and gin: Football legend Paul Gascoigne looking frail and weak carrying a bottle of gin and cigarettes in the town centre of Bournemouth

Paul Gascoigne has been kept in hospital four a four-day emergency detox to help him recover from his latest alcoholic breakdown.

The former England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer, 47, has been in Poole Hospital since he collapsed outside his home in Sandbanks, Dorset, clutching a bottle of gin.

Friends of Gascoigne have said he is desperate for another stint of rehab, but following a string of failed business deals has no cash to check himself in.

Gascoigne is set to be discharged from hospital tomorrow. The Sunday Mirror claims relatives and friends will then rally round in an attempt to intervene to get him to change his self-destructive course.

He may then travel to the North East, his home region, to stay with his father, John, while he tries to battle his addiction.

The Sun on Sunday reports that Gascoigne is desperate to return to the luxury U.S. rehab centre he attended last year after friends including Chris Evans raised £40,000 to fund his treatment.

The paper's reporter cites a 'mate' of Gascoigne as saying the fallen midfield magician has been spending hours on end at home drinking heavily and listening to Amy Winehouse's tragically prescient song Rehab on repeat.

The Sun On Sunday's report appeared to contradict the Sunday Mirror's, claiming that Gascoigne would be taken straight from hospital to rehab, possibly the Cottonwood Clinic in Arizona that he attended last year.

But the paper quoted a friend of the family as saying: 'They don't know where they will get the money. A lot of people won't be daft enough to put their hands in their pockets again.'

The Sunday Mirror reports Gascoigne had been left depressed after he was rebuffed by several television channels he had approached in hopes of working as a World Cup pundit.

He was also said to be upset at not being offered the chance to appear on any reality TV programmes.

'Over the last few years he's had many offers to appear on reality TV shows but decided against it,' the Sunday Mirror quoted an unnamed source as saying.

'This year when he could do with the money he's not heard anything.'

Misery is heaping on to misery for Gascoigne. Yesterday it was reported that he could be homeless in just 10 days after being told he must quit his £3million rented penthouse apartment.

A string of 'noise complaints' by neighbours in the luxury apartment block, which overlooks Poole Harbour, is said to have led to the ultimatum.

The director of the management company in charge of the flats has dismissed claims he is being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave.

'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.'

A friend however has reportedly said that the ex-footballer has been told to leave before the end date. Months ago, he had to leave another rented apartment in Sandbanks after a series of disturbances.

In the midst of his latest health scare, two builders have also described how they pulled the former Newcastle player from a bush following a suspected drinking session.

Dan Lawrence, 31, and his brother Ben, 29, helped Gascoigne up after they saw two legs 'sticking out of the bush' and found him rolling around and struggling to get up. The pair told The Sun that the footballer had a brief chat with them before 'stumbling off' towards his flat.

Two days later, Gascoigne looked dazed and occasionally broke into sobs, as he was led to an ambulance after being found wandering the streets clutching a four-pack of lager and a bottle of gin.

The former World Cup hero’s latest downward spiral ended in hospital near his home in the expensive Sandbanks area of Poole, where he woke up on Thursday afternoon after once more falling spectacularly off the wagon.

In the most shocking chapter yet of his long and often very public battle with alcoholism, onlookers had dialled 999 after finding him slumped tearfully against a wall with his head in his hands at around 2.30pm.

Shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away, at 3.05pm, the former England star was seen calling a friend to plead: ‘I’m in trouble, please can you come and help me?’

Gascoigne, who looks far, far older than his 47 years, was believed last night to be in Poole Hospital.

He had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days, and at lunchtime on Tuesday was videoed by a passer-by in what appeared to be an inebriated state, in central Bournemouth.

‘You could smell the booze on him. He was hanging on me to stay up. He was absolutely battered,’ said an onlooker. When he was taken into care 48 hours later, he appeared to still be wearing the same T-shirt.
