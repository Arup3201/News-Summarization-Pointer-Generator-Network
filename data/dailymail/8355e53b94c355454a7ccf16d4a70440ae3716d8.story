New look: Strictly Come Dancing viewers were not keen on Claudia Winkleman's (left) new hairstyle

For years, her distinctive fringe and heavy eye make-up made Claudia Winkleman instantly recognisable as the presenter of the Strictly Come Dancing spin-off show It Takes Two.

So it was hardly surprising that viewers were left reeling when the 42-year-old star appeared to have undergone a dramatic makeover in preparation for her new role on the main programme, replacing Sir Bruce Forsyth as co-presenter alongside Tess Daly.

With a new shaggy hairstyle, and a hot pink top and skirt by designer Roland Mouret replacing her traditional black outfits, Claudia provoked a wave of criticism on social media, with some viewers describing her new look as ‘awful’ and others urging her to bring back her ‘sooty eyes and long fringe’.

Some viewers even embarked on a Twitter campaign using the hashtag #BringBackClaudiasFringe. One wrote: ‘Claudia Winkleman looks like she’s wearing a towel and didn’t have chance to get ready.’

Another said: ‘Why the hell hasn’t Claudia Winkleman got her eye liner on? It’s the reason I love her!’

And one comment read: ‘Was it just me or did Claudia Winkleman look awful last night? She looked 10 years older.’

However, some welcomed the presenter’s change of appearance. One viewer wrote: ‘I loved Claudia Winkleman’s new look on #StrictlyComeDancing – nice to see her out of black, with less eye make-up and a shorter fringe.’

More than 5.8 million people tuned in on Friday to watch the first competitive show of this year’s series. Six couples took to the dance floor while the rest were performing last night. There is no public vote this week but the judges’ scores will be carried through to next week.

In pole position on the leaderboard after Friday’s show was actor Jake Wood – best known for playing philanderer Max Branning in EastEnders – who scored 28 out of 40 for his jive to Good Golly Miss Molly with partner Janette Manrara.
