The BBC’s coverage of the bombing of Dresden in which Britain was described as ‘worse than the Third Reich’ was condemned as disgraceful by RAF veterans and MPs last night.

Despite dedicating more than 32 minutes of airtime to the 70th anniversary of the fire-bombing that killed tens of thousands at the end of the Second World War, there was barely a mention of British airmen who lost their lives.

The BBC’s four major news shows and Radio 4 interviewed multiple German survivors of the bombings.

They showed Victor Gregg a British prisoner of war who berated those who ordered the raids, adding it was ‘demonic’ and ‘evil’.

But the coverage failed to mention the 55,000 airmen who died for Britain during the war. Nor did it mention the devastating Nazi bombing raids on London and Coventry.

One presenter even referred to Dresden as a ‘war crime’ and another spoke of how Britain ‘deliberately unleashed devastation on civilians’, while failing to refer to Auschwitz or Hitler. 

During the only interview – which lasted just 23 seconds – with an RAF crewman who flew on the raid, the 91-year-old was asked: ‘Did you ever feel guilty about what happened at Dresden?’ Former Lancaster bomber rear gunner Harry Irons DFC simply replied: ‘No, not really.’

Last night politicians, historians and military figures said the coverage was a ‘disgrace’ and disrespectful to the airmen who served and died in Bomber Command.

Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is very unfortunate that the BBC chose on all days to produce such a one-sided account.

‘It was just as one might expect from the BBC, concentrating on the negatives.

‘What about the civilians in London who were bombed out of their homes? What about the bombing in the Blitz? To suggest that those responsible for the bombing of Dresden were on a par with Hitler or guilty of war crimes is an absolute disgrace.’

Most of the BBC coverage focused on an interview with Victor Gregg, 95, who was a British prisoner of war in Dresden during the bombing. He said: ‘I saw people killed every day... but what I saw in Dresden – I’ve never seen women and children involved before.’

Asked by the presenter if he thought it was a war crime, he said: ‘Definitely.’

Mike Brundle, who served in the RAF for over 25 years, said: ‘The BBC should have had someone who was a member of Bomber Command on that operation – those are the ones who risked their lives.

A total of 125,000 men served as Bomber Command aircrew during the Second World War.

Their chance of surviving the war was lower than that of infantry officers in First World War trenches.

Bomber Command had a 44 per cent death rate – 55,573 died in action.

The average age of crewmen was 22 but the youngest were only 18.

A total of 9,838 members of Bomber Command became prisoners of war.

Of the 365,514 sorties flown by bomber crews, 297,663 were at night.

Some 3,249 Lancasters were lost in action – nine during the bombing of Dresden.

Almost three quarters of Bomber Command dead were British – the rest were from Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Victoria Crosses were awarded to 19 members of Bomber Command.

‘If the war had gone on for another year, how many millions more would have been killed at Auschwitz?

‘By all means cover it but the one-sided BBC coverage has incensed me. He (Victor Gregg) said we were worse than the Nazis.'

A woman who wrote a letter to the Daily Mail added: ‘The BBC is beyond belief. Do we hear you “celebrating” the “hell” that was Swansea burning, or Coventry, or Plymouth, or Portsmouth – with the same unctuous sympathy as you are showing for Dresden? We have nothing to be guilty about.’

Military historians and former military top brass defended the bombing of Dresden.

Historian Frederick Taylor told the Mail: ‘Thousands of innocent civilians as well as soldiers were dying every day as battles raged in east and west – not forgetting the concentration camp inmates who were still being murdered by starvation, violence, disease, and forced marches.

‘How could any resource – including the massive Allied air forces – be left unused in trying to shorten the war and save many, many thousands more innocent lives? There should have been more room for another view.’

Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, added: ‘It was an entirely understandable target. The bomber crews carried out the duty they were equipped to do with bravery and efficiency. I would have liked to see (the BBC) talking about the lessons of the war and a mention of Bomber Command.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The bombing of Dresden has always been a controversial episode. On Thursday evening the main BBC News bulletins reflected this and featured interviews with British veterans in coverage of preparations for the commemoration. On Friday we covered the commemoration ceremony in Dresden, which understandably reflected on the German experience.’

A BBC spokesperson added: 'BBC News has covered in greater depth than any other broadcaster many aspects of the commemoration of World War II - both the human cost on all sides and the military action - and will continue to do so.' 

The BBC’s coverage of Dresden began on Thursday night:

BBC News at Ten, 10.24-10.28pm

Report dominated by disturbing images of German casualties and a graphic interview with prisoner of war Victor Gregg, 96, who talks of bodies ‘exploding’. A whole minute is devoted to survivors Anita John and Nora Lang, who describe seeing ‘the dead everywhere’ and thinking it was ‘the end of the world’.

Only 23 seconds are given to RAF veteran Harry Irons, 91, who is asked: ‘Did you ever feel guilty after the war about what had happened at Dresden?’ He replies: ‘No, not really. I think because we were very young and we lost so many boys ourselves.’

The reporter says the campaign showed how the allies ‘deliberately unleashed devastation on civilians’.

BBC Breakfast, 6.07-6.10am yesterday

Focuses on German survivor Ursula Elsner, who says: ‘We clung to a lamppost but one woman didn’t make it … she was sucked into the burning ruins.’

No one from Bomber Command or UK military is featured. The only alternative view is from Dresden Military Museum’s Gorch Pieken, saying: ‘It is just an example of warfare and of course it makes sense … Dresden was part of the enemy and you have to hit the enemy to end the Second World War.’
