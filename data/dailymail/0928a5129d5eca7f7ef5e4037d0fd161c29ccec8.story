Raffaele Sollecito has been spotted looking at a £100,000 car in the wake of his murder acquittal after being accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher.

Mr Sollecito, who spent four years in prison after previously being found guilty of  the murder of Surrey-born Meredith, 21, in 2007, is said to be looking at compensation.

The 31-year-old was spotted looking at a £105,000 BMW at a dealership in Rome following his aquittal on Friday.

'Healing'? Raffaele Sollecito, who was cleared of murdering Meredith Kercher on Friday, was seen looking at a £105,000 BMW at a dealership in Rome

The Italian and his American ex-lover Amanda Knox, 27, were both sensationally cleared on Friday, bringing an end to a see-sawing legal process which spanned more than seven years and saw them both serve four years in prison. 

Speaking later at a press conference in Rome, Mr Sollecito described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare'.

He spent four years in prison before being freed in 2011, said he wanted to get back to his old life after enduring over seven years of 'a kind of pain without an end'. 

Until Friday's ruling, life was a 'kind of limbo,' Sollecito said. 

'So for me, the wounds inside my soul, inside my heart ... it's very hard to erase them.' He said he needed 'time to heal,' and 'time to really breathe this fresh air.' 

Planning ahead: Sollecito's lawyer says her client will wait for Italy's top court to give the reasoning behind the acquittal, expected in about three months' time, before taking a decision on compensation

Amanda Knox vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after Friday's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in 2011

'I feel today like someone who was kidnapped, who after seven years and five months has returned to freedom,' Sollecito said.

Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison.

While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums.

Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said on Monday her
client, would wait for Italy's top court to give the
reasoning behind the acquittal, expected in about three months'
time, before taking a decision.

'We have already heard people talking about compensation ...
if we want to make someone pay,' Bongiorno said at a news
conference. 

'We will see if any mistakes were made, what
measures to take, but this is all far in the future.' 

Yesterday, Knox's lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph.   

Mr Sollecito's father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' 

Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, described the ruling on Friday night as 'odd'.

She said: '(I am) a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice so it's a bit odd that it should change now.'

Her daughter, who was 21 and from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy.

Miss Knox told reporters outside her family home in Seattle on the day of the verdict that she was 'full of joy'.

'Right now I'm still absorbing what all this means and what comes to mind is my gratitude for the life that's been given to me,' she said.

Seattle-born Miss Knox, 27, who was Ms Kercher's flat-mate, and Mr Sollecito, spent four years in jail for the murder but were acquitted on appeal in 2011.

But Italy's highest court on Friday overturned last year's convictions and declined to order another trial.  

The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence.  

Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007. 

They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively. 

After they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent.

Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years.

Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair on Friday after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. It was met with stunned silence. 

Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder.

The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood.

The court will publish its reasons for Friday's decision within 90 days.
