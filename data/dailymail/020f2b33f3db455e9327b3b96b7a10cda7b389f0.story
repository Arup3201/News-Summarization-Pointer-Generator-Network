Nicholas Whittaker, 43, (pictured outside an earlier court hearing) has been warned he could face jail after cracking the window of a Thomson Dreamliner

A passenger who punched and smashed an airliner window during a row with his partner admitted in court he deserves 'no sympathy' after being warned he faces jail for his actions.

Nicholas Whittaker, 43, sparked panic among passengers on the Thomson Dreamliner after he cracked the inner window of the jet with a single punch while it was 35,000ft in the air.

The father of two, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to recklessly acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or anyone on it when he appeared at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court yesterday.

The court heard how he lashed out on the Boeing 787 following a row with his partner Clare Houston as they returned from a holiday in Florida on May 25.

The incident occurred at about 5.30am as the Dreamliner was coming to the end of its flight from Florida's Sanford Airport and was packed with families returning from their holidays, with many having enjoyed trips to Disney World in Orlando.

The plane was approximately six miles above Ireland when the row broke out and the pilot considered diverting to the country's airport before ultimately deciding to continue to Manchester.

The court heard how cabin crew asked Whittaker to calm down but he responded by telling them to 'f*** off' before punching the window and shouting: 'I'm not a f****** terrorist.'

The force of his fist caused a crack in the glass of the interior widow, causing passengers aboard flight Tom145 to scramble to their feet in a bid to move to another part of the jet for fear it would shatter completely.

Upon arrival at Manchester Airport, former bus driver Whittaker - who was not thought to have been drinking - was arrested by officers who were waiting for him at the gate. Police confirmed afterwards that no one was injured in the incident.

After being released on bail, Whittaker said he was sorry for his actions but claimed to have no memory of the incident.

He said 'it's not something I chose to do' and claimed to be seeking treatment for mental health problems.

Becoming tearful, he added: 'I've only got one feeling about all this and that's for all those people that were frightened to death up there. I don't deserve sympathy.'

Asked if he wanted to say anything to the other passengers on board the jet, he said: 'Sorry, but it's not a big enough word. Of course, they were frightened.

'There's some guy going nuts. To this day I can't fix that for them.'

Whittaker said he had 'lost some hours of my life', adding: 'I don't know if I can get them back.'

He went on: 'For me to try to justify it is impossible. There's no justification.

'All I can do is offer the reasons and offer the apologies.'

At yesterday's hearing, Judge Adrian Smith adjourned the case for sentence on January 6 and told the court 'all options remain open' including a jail sentence.

Following the incident, aviation experts said passengers are only at risk if both the inner and outer pane of an aircraft window are breached. In Whittaker's case, it is understood only the inner pane was cracked.

At an earlier hearing, Whittaker turned up to court with Miss Houston and listened as prosecutors outlined the offence.

Prosecutor Miss Lauren Costello told Trafford magistrates: 'He became engaged in a domestic with Claire Houston with finger pointing to raised voices and in some instances pushing her head and swinging headphones which struck her in the face.

'Crew were aware his actions were causing concern and upset as there were passengers who were moving their children away.

The 43-year-old father of two was travelling on a Boeing 787 Thomson Dreamliner (similar to the one pictured above) when the incident occurred on May 25. He was arrested at the gate upon arrival at Manchester Airport

'He was advised regarding his behaviour but it didn't faze him. He was swearing at crew and passengers telling them to "f*** off".

'There was then a loud bang and raised voices. An attendant saw an internal window had been cracked due to a punch by the defendant.

'Passengers were distressed by the window and took to their feet and he then began shouting "I'm not a f****** terrorist" and required calming down.

'While it was taking place the captain was made aware and informed of the damage.

'The captain had to make a decision whether to divert or continue as it was an internal window made the decision to continue and police were called so he could be arrested. '

Whittaker's lawyers initially argued that he was not guilty of endangering life as the damage he caused was internal window and 'just cosmetic.' 

A Thomson Airways spokesman said: ‘We do have a zero-tolerance approach on all our aircraft.

‘Passenger safety is our paramount priority.'
