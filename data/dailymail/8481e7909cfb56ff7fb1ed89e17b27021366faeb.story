Non-single ladies, it may be prudent to drop your expectations in the run-up to this Valentine's Day, according to a new infographic.

Hugs and Disses, which was compiled by Chicago-based branding agency Arc, asked men and women questions about the looming February 14 celebration and perhaps unsurprisingly, it yielded rather polarizing results.

While nearly 40per cent of women quizzed said they wanted 'an evening out at a special event', only 20per cent of men plan on delivering this.

And men aren't just avoiding a special night out. While 33per cent of women want 'a romantic evening at home', only 18per cent of men have this in mind.

At least some of us are striking gold, since 30per cent of women admit they are 'at least somewhat envious' of how others are treated by their Valentine.

On average, men cough up $137 in honor of the big day, while women spend around $86.

This generosity is often forced out grudgingly. Thirty-seven per cent of men think Valentine's Day is 'a total racket', and are four times more likely to give a gift 'out of obligation' than women.

Ten per cent of men think the day is only slightly better than getting a tooth pulled, and nearly double the number of women versus men say they 'enjoy' the holiday.

When it comes to gifts, 17per cent of men want to receive electronics, but only four per cent of women actually plan to electrify the day with such a present.

On the flip side, 28per cent of women give men candy for Valentine's Day, when only 12per cent of men actually want it.

The worst gift you can give a man, according to the infographic, is a cuddly toy. For women, its 'home decor' related presents.

You don't say: Men's generosity is often forced out grudgingly, with 37per cent saying they think Valentine's Day is 'a total racket', and men are four times more likely to give a gift 'out of obligation'

Dinner is the gift most men and women plan on - and hope to receive - and 40per cent of both sexes wait until the last week to make plans.

Twenty-two per cent of men expect nothing at all, in comparison to eight per cent of women.

One thing men and women do agree on? Kissing. More than 80per cent of those polled overall said they expect a smooch on Valentine's Day, and nearly half expect 'a little somethin' something' more'.
