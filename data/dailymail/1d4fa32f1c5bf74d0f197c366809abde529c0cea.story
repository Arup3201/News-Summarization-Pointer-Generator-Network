Thousands of police officers armed with guns have swarmed the streets of Cardiff ahead of the Nato summit as almost 10,000 officers gear up to police event.

World leaders including Barack Obama and Angela Merkel will arrive in the city for working dinners after attending the main event at Celtic Manor in Newport on Thursday.

Officers drafted in from across the country wear light blue caps, which are said to symbolise that they are part of the same team, as they patrol the 10 miles of security fencing dubbed ‘the ring of steel’.

And the two-day event is said to be the first time a serving US president will visit Wales.

Supporting police is HMS Duncan which arrived at Cardiff Bay today and is expected to be joined by five other Nato warships ahead of the event.

The security fencing and police presence is said to have left the city resembling a high security prison and unhappy residents have taken to Twitter to vent their anger

The 30 members attempted to climb the structure and blasted music from speakers but were outnumbered by officers by almost two to one.

Not everyone is said to be happy about the increased police presence and with people living in Cardiff taking to Twitter to express their annoyance.

Sports therapy student Alex Conroy said: ‘Cardiff is currently like living in a prison community, police and helicopters everywhere.’

Nessaatsix said: ‘The huge police presence in Cardiff right now is actually pretty intimidating. Especially the ones carrying those huge guns.’

However, user Alice Roythorne defended the force, tweeting: ‘So many people moaning about the police in Cardiff. Lots of them in the Bay, all friendly, chatty, just doing their job.’
