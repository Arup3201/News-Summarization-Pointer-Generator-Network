Davis admitted to investigators he had choked his mother with a cord and stabbed her in the head before finally killing her with a hammer, according to KiiiTV.

The teenager had reportedly asked his mother for permission to die, because he had grown 'weary with life and hated other people.'

When she told him she was upset, but that he could decide to do what he wished, he snapped and murdered her, the Corpus Cristi Caller Times reported. 

Grisly: Jurors heard Davis describe everything he did to his mother during an interview, where he signed his confession 

No remorse: Davis told police who interviewed him that he did not regret what he had done, though he says he did love her

Police found Hill's body undressed from the waist down and posed. 

Davis told investigators during his interview that he had sexually abused his mother after she was murdered.

In the interview, Davis told investigators, 'I wouldn’t take back what I did. I did love her in a way'

Davis almost waited for his sister to kill her too, but decided against it, instead leaving a trail of blood in the home leading from the living room to the master bedroom, along with written messages such as 'Chase me. Sorry for the mess. KD.' 

'I had my fill of killing. It seemed a little much,' he told investigators. 

From his home, he took his bicycle and backpack and tried to leave town. 

He eventually abandoned both in a bush by the train tracks and walked to a home in nearby Robstown, where he confessed to a couple.

In the interview, Davis told investigators, 'I wouldn’t take back what I did. I did love her in a way.'

'I’m a terrible, disgusting person,' he added.

He also told investigators he had homicidal fantasies about his sister and mother.

Calling it 'a night to remember,' he described another fantasy where he would decapitate a girl before having sex with her body in a dress. 

The defense called no witnesses during the trial, and when Davis's lawyer appealed for a lighter sentence in light of mental issues Davis had, the prosecution's reply was to say that it had seen no medical evidence of any mental or emotional illness.

Davis told investigators he thought he deserved 100 years and claimed, 'I'm not mentally disturbed. I’m sane. I know what I did.'

'I don’t have standards. I don’t have morals. A body’s a body. A piece of meat,' said Davis.
