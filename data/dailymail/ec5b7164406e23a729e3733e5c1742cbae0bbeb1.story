This is the terrifying moment an armed raider burst into a shop, attacked the shopkeeper with a hammer and made off with fistfuls of banknotes.

CCTV footage shows the robber make the brazen attack at a Costcutter store in Desborough, Northamptonshire.

The hooded man, who is being hunted by police, can be seen waving the hammer threateningly before taking a swing at the cashier who says he has been left fearing for his life.

The man, who wears a balaclava, then works his way through the cash in the till, filling his pockets with notes and even rifling through the small change.

He then removes a packet of cigarettes from a shelf and seems to consider taking them as well, before changing his mind and dropping them on the floor.

After raising the hammer twice more at the cowering worker, he can then be seen calmly leaving the shop.

Today the Costcutter employee - who does not want to be named - said he still suffers from pains in his arm two weeks on from the attack that happened at around 9pm on Friday 25 November.

He said: 'I was doing all the paper returns. He came in, he was trying to hit me with the hammer.

'I was face-to-face with him. He was very near to me and I didn't get time to react to him. I said to him I didn't want to fight. He cornered me and asked me to empty the till. He emptied all the money, even some of the coins.

'I was trying to look at his face because only his eyes were visible. Then he took the hammer again and used a threatening tone. I still have pain in my arms and I had an X-ray.

'It was just horrific.'

Police are now hunting for the man who is white, in his 20s and described as about 5ft 5in tall. He was wearing black trousers, a black and silver jacket, black gloves and a cap and had masked his face using a scarf.

Witnesses to the incident, or anyone with any information, are asked to contact Northamptonshire Police, or they can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511.
