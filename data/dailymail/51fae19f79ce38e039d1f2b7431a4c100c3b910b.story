BBC presenter Andrew Marr left hospital yesterday, nearly two months after suffering a stroke.

The 53-year-old broadcaster will continue his rehabilitation at home.

A statement released by the corporation said Marr was ‘looking forward’ to a ‘new regime of physio’ and wished to ‘continue his recovery privately’.

Marr, who has his own Sunday 
morning BBC1 show and is a familiar voice on Radio 4, is expected to 
return to work later this year.

A BBC spokeswoman said today: 'Andrew Marr left hospital earlier on today and continues his rehabilitation at home with his family.

'He says thank you to all the wonderful nurses, doctors and physiotherapists at Charing Cross hospital who have looked after him so well.

'He is looking forward to a new regime of physio at home as he prepares for his return to work later this year.'

She added that Marr and his family hope people will allow him to 'recover privately'.

The broadcaster fell ill at his home in East Sheen, south west London at the start of the year.

Colleagues were left stunned and concerned when the BBC revealed Mr Marr's illness.

He is married to journalist Jackie Ashley and has three children.

Guest presenters have stepped in to cover his duties since the stroke.

Marr, the corporation's former political editor, began his career as a newspaper reporter, becoming the editor of The Independent before turning to television.

He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published.

He is known for his hard hitting interviews of politicians and public figures.
