Residents and visitors to Israel will soon be able to take in the bustling city’s sights, from the comfort of a hovering sky car.

A 1,640ft (500 metre) monorail is being built on the campus of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) next year, with a commercial network set to follow that will extend across Tel Aviv.

While monorails may seem like a retro creation, this futuristic version will use cutting edge technology to see two-person pods suspended from magnetic tracks, so they appear to hover.

A 1,640ft (500 metre) monorail is being built on the campus of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) next year. If it is successful, a larger skyTran system could be rolled out across Tel Aviv, Israel.

The new system will see two-person pods suspended from magnetic tracks so they appear to hover.

The network of computer-controlled ‘jet-like’ vehicles will use Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) technology to provide what the firm says is fast, safe, free and economical travel.

The computer-controlled pods will travel at up to 43mph (70km/h).

If the technology is rolled out commercially, the pods could travel at up to 150 mph (240 km/h).

It is estimated that tickets could cost around $5 (£2.90) per rider, but discounts and subscriptions are also planned.

The company behind the grand plan – California-based skyTran – claims its system is a clever alternative to congested roads, and that tracks could even travel through buildings as soon as 2016.

The network of computer-controlled ‘jet-like’ vehicles will use Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) technology to provide what the firm says is fast, safe, free and economical travel.

‘skyTran intends to revolutionise public transportation and, with it, urban and suburban commuting,’ the company, based at Nasa's Space Act company headquartered at the Ames Research Centre, said.

Like other magev trains, the system uses powerful electromagnets that let carriages float over – or in this case under – a track. The system uses the basic principle that opposite magnetic poles attract and repel each other.

Instead of an engine, the pods will use a magnetic field created by electrified coils in the track to allow them to hover and propel them along.

As well as looking cool, using magnetic levitation instead of wheels mean there is no physical contact between the vehicle and the ‘guideway’ or rail, so there is no wear and tear.

Because the vehicles are levitated a short distance away from the guideway, and both lift and thrust are produced by electromagnets, their speed can be easily controlled and the company said they could achieve reliable high speeds of up to 150 mph (240 km/h).

Luxurious: Unlike monorails at theme parks, the pods will be plush and private, similar to a a car (illustrated). They will also travel much faster at 43mph (70km/h) - although these speeds could rise if the system is rolled out across greater distances

Maglev technology is already used in high-speed railways, such as Shanghai's Maglev Train (pictured), which has a top operational speed of 268mph (431km/h). But the monorail is the ultimate refinement of the system

Maglev uses magnetic levitation instead of wheels.

The idea is that because the system makes no physical contact between the vehicle and the guideway, there is nothing to wear out or fail.

The technology promises a smooth and quiet journey that is high speed and energy efficient.

It is already used in high-speed railways, but the monorail is the ultimate refinement of the system.

Railways like Shanghai's Maglev Train use large superconducting electromagnets in a special configuration to produce intense magnetic fields over long distances.

Opening in 2004, it was the first commercially operated high-speed magnetic levitation line in the world.

Trains have a top speed of 268mph (431km/h) and connect Shanghai Pudong International Airport and the outskirts of Pudong with the Shanghai Metro.

This technology will ‘provide a platform for skyTran vehicles to travel at high speeds, with full payloads while levitating,’ the company said.

The electrified system could even be powered by solar or wind power.

The aim in building the test track is to convince town planners that the technology works so that in the near future, people could order a vehicle on their smartphone to collect them from a specified station, and then take them to their chosen destination.

Unlike monorails at theme parks, the pods will be plush and private. They will also travel much faster, at 43mph (70km/h) although these speeds could rise substantially if the system is rolled out across greater distances.

It is 
estimated that construction of the first commercial system will take two
 years at a cost of around $80 million (£47,000) and will extend to 
cover the whole ‘Gush Dan’ urban and suburban area.

Individual
 tickets are predicted to cost around $5 (£2.90 or 17 new Israel 
shekels) per rider, but discounts and subscriptions are also planned.

If
 the pilot and initial commercial rollout prove a success, other cites 
could look to the skies to provide local travel solutions too.

There are skyTran routes in ‘advanced planning’ for Toulouse, France, Kerala, India and San Francisco Bay in California.
