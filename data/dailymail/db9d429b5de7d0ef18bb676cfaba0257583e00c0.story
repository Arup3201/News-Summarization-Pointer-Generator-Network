Lack of co-operation: Pakistani protesters burn a poster of Obama. The U.S. spy chief in the country has unexpectedly quit his post

The U.S. spy chief in Islamabad has unexpectedly quit his post amid rumours of a rift with his Pakistani colleagues.

U.S. and Pakistani officials say the CIA station chief who ran operations in Pakistan during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden left his post due to illness.

But another Pakistani source claims issues surrounding the working relationship between spies from the two countries led to the sudden departure.

The station chief, who cannot be named because he works undercover, is said to have been an important liaison with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.

He guided intelligence operations in the country through a troubled time in U.S.-Pakistani relations.

The senior spook's sudden resignation was first reported by CBS news, citing a Pakistani government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The official told CBS 'there were issues both internal to America's working in Pakistan and issues with Pakistan' which prompted the departure.

American officials, who also spoke anonymously, told the Associated Press the outgoing chief also clashed with U.S. ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter.

Ambassador Munter had objected to CIA drone strikes during diplomatic negotiations.

The spy chief's sudden resignation marks yet another possible sign of strains in the relationship between the two countries, which has been under pressure since the assassination of terror chief Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, northern Pakistan.

Military and civilian leaders in Pakistan reacted angrily to the U.S. decision to withhold information on the raid from Pakistani authorities.

It was feared that any information shared could have been leaked to Islamist militant groups sympathetic to al Qaida and the Taliban.

A European ambassador, who spoke to CBS News on condition of anonymity, said the senior spy's departure 'deeply suggests that the U.S.-Pakistan relationship continues to be surrounded with tension'.

The ambassador added: 'Unless the U.S. and Pakistan quickly work out their differences, we will have to live with some pretty severe consequences.'

The news came as Pakistan imposed travel curbs on U.S. and other diplomats in the latest sign of worsening ties between the troubled allies since the killing of bin Laden.

A Western diplomatic source said the U.S. embassy received a 'diplomatic note' from the Pakistani foreign ministry last month, setting travel guidelines for diplomats outside the capital Islamabad.

The restrictions came amid Pakistani media reports that U.S. diplomats travelling from Islamabad were turned away from the north-western city of Peshawar in recent weeks for not having a 'no objection certificate' from authorities.

Pakistan is an important ally for the United States in its fight against Islamist militancy, but relations have been on downward spiral after a CIA contractor killed two Pakistanis in January.

More tensions emerged after U.S. forces killed bin Laden in May without informing Islamabad beforehand.

The United States recently suspended about a third of its $2.7 billion annual defence aid to Islamabad in a show of displeasure over Pakistan's cutbacks on U.S. trainers and limits on visas for U.S. personnel.

Meanwhile, U.S. drone-fired missiles slammed into a car near the Afghan border on Monday, killing four suspected Islamist militants, Pakistani intelligence officials said.

The missile strike took place in the Nargusa area of South Waziristan, which like much of the rugged border region is home to al-Qaida and Taliban fighters.

Officials identified the dead men as Pakistani militants, but said they were not from the border region. Two other fighters were wounded in the strike.

The United States routinely fires missiles from unmanned drones at militants in northwest Pakistan.
