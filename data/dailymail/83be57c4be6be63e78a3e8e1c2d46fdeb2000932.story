Yaritza Oliva recently started crying blood and has doctors baffled

The 20-year-old said that the pain in her eyes is 'indescribable'

When she visited the doctor no infection was found so she was sent home with eye drops.

But, her parents, who cannot afford to send her to an appropriate medical expert, have asked friends and neighbours to help them raise funds for her.

Father, Jose, made an appeal on a local news programme.

Her family is asking for financial help so she can undergo treatment from appropriate experts

Doctors believe it may be a case of haemolacria, a condition that has only been diagnosed three times before

Haemolacria is the condition that makes sufferers cry tears of blood.

The tears can either have a red tinge or appear as though they are entirely made of blood.

While the visual impact of haemolacria is powerful and may be very scary, it is not always cause for concern

It is a symptom of many diseases and may be indicative of a tumour in the system that produces tears.

It can also be provoked by conjunctivitis, environmental damage or injuries.

There have been cases of Haemolacria induced by hormones in grown women.

Some researchers suggest that it is connected to extreme stress or psychological upset.

The carpenter said: ‘Please put your hands over your hearts, see our situation and help my daughter.’

Some experts have suggested that Miss Oliva has a condition called haemolacria.

The rare condition causes sufferers to cry tears of blood.

Haemolacria can indicate a more serious illness, such as a tumour and can be caused by high levels of hormones in women.

A teenage boy was diagnosed with haemolacria in 2009 after he cried blood three times a day.

Calvino Inman, 15, from Tennessee, said that he had no warning when the tears were about to occur.

He said that sometimes he could not feel them, and others it was like a burning sensation.

He and his mother appeared on television to appeal for help, but they did not find a cure.

Very little is known of the condition.
