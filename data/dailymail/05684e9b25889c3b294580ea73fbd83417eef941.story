A three-year-old girl was turned away from a holiday hotel children’s club because she suffers from a form of dwarfism.

The incident has been condemned by the girl’s mother and campaigners as evidence of the prejudice that people born with the condition have to overcome.

Young Eva Moissard was on holiday with her mum, Heidi, and two older sisters, Noa, aged 17, and Anna, 14, at the Club Magic Life Penelope Beach, in Djerba, Tunisia.

The mother says she rang the holiday company before the family travelled to their destination to inform them of Eva's condition. She says the company assured her her daughter would be welcomed by the play group

Before going away Mrs Moissard contacted the holiday company, Thomson, to explain that Eva had a form of dwarfism – achondroplasia – and had limited mobility because of her age and size.

She specifically wanted to know that the children’s club at the hotel would accept Eva and was given and assurance that it would.

However, when the family arrived at the hotel, staff working in the club made clear that they saw Eva as a burden and that she would not be welcome to join in the fun and games.

Mrs Moissard said the experience had been heart breaking, particularly when set against the achievements of people in the public eye who have dwarfism, such as the celebrated Paralympic swimmer, Ellie Simmonds, and the actor, Warwick Davis.

Mr Davis is co-founder of the campaigning group Little People UK, which support families where children are born with the condition.

A spokesman for the group said: ‘It is disheartening that in the 21st century, people with dwarfism are still being judged on what other people perceive they can't do, or by how they look.

‘Bodies come in all shapes and sizes. There are over 200 different types of dwarfism, making up a population of over 6,000 people with the condition in the UK today.

‘These individuals wish to be able to live happy and successful lives without facing the preconceptions of people who cannot see beyond their height. It is unfortunate that many little people are teased and stared at throughout their lives because their bodies look different, to that of an average sized person.

‘Eighty percent of people with dwarfism have average height parents and siblings. Some types of dwarfism are simply a genetic change at conception, which happens to have very visible results.’

Mrs Moissard, a 43-year-old single mum, from Bedfordshire, said her family had been looking forward to the holiday at the end of May.

‘It is quite tough for us. We had not been on holiday together as a family for a very long time and the girls were really keen to go away,’ she said.

‘We spend a lot of time looking after Eva and we wanted a holiday where there was a kids club that would take three year olds to give her and everyone a break. After searching on the internet, we found this particular holiday and hotel with Thomson.

‘Eva is small and one aspect of her condition is that her muscle tone is not as well developed as other three year olds, which means she can walk a little but is not running around.’

Mrs Moissard, who gave up a plan to retrain as French teacher to look after Eva, said: ‘I called Thomson to make sure that the hotel and kids club would accept her.

‘I explained Eva had a form of dwarfism and had limited mobility. They assured me the hotel would have to accept Eva at the children’s club and would make sure that they did. Based on that assurance, I went ahead and booked.’

But Mrs Moissard said: ‘When we got there and went to kids club with Eva in her buggy, the lady who was in charge said she can’t come in because she can’t walk.

‘She said she would not be able to do any of the activities, such as going for a picnic or to the beach. They said they did not have the staff to push Eva in her buggy.

‘Naturally, I got quite upset and emotional on Eva’s behalf, particularly as I have been assured they would take her.’

She explained that Eva goes to a nursery two days a week when she is at home and is used to spending time with other children and adults outside the immediate family. Eventually, the staff relented and said she could attend some morning sessions, providing the family remained close by.

‘We did go back , but the staff were immediately giving each other very funny looks and made it clear Eva was not welcome. The people were not taking much care of the children, so we just took her out.’

The situation was raised with the hotel’s entertainments manager, who showed no concern or sympathy.

‘He was really rude to me in front of everybody. He said they could not accept a child like that, pointing at Eva, and said she would not be able to take part in any of the activities.

‘He said if Thomson had bothered to call them he would have made clear they could not accept her.

‘This was all in front of Eva and she understands what is going on and she was going to be excluded. It was just horrid, and so upsetting. I really can’t understand why they would discriminate against a child like this. It was heart breaking.’

She complained to the Thomson rep and again when the family returned home. Initially, Thomson claimed that Mrs Moissard did not fully explain Eva’s condition, which she says is untrue and has added insult to injury.

At first the travel company offered a good will gesture of £200 by way of an apology, but it later offered a full refund.

‘I feel very badly let down by Thomson. I explained the situation to them and I would not have booked unless I was given a clear assurance that Eva would be welcome,’ she said

The holiday company have now apologised to the family - and said they will review their booking systems

Thomson apologised and promised to review how it processes bookings. A spokesman said: ‘Thomson is sorry to hear about Mrs Moissard’s disappointment with the kids’ club at Club Magic Life Penelope Beach, Djerba, Tunisia.

'Club Magic Life welcomes children with disabilities at all of its hotel-run kids’ clubs. It plans its staffing levels very carefully to ensure that the correct ratio of children to staff is maintained at all times. A child with mobility issues will require one-to-one support, and therefore the kids’ club must be informed in advance that the child wishes to attend.

'When booking, Mrs Moissard advised us of her daughter’s condition, but the agent did not appreciate that this can result in mobility issues. 

'Had the agent been aware of this, she would have contacted the hotel to ensure they were prepared and adequately staffed to welcome her daughter. Whilst Thomson extensively trains its staff on how to take bookings from customers with special requirements, it is important that customers share as much information as possible so that we are able to provide the best holiday experience for them.

'The team in resort did their utmost to ensure that Mrs Moissard’s daughter was able to join in all appropriate activities, and as a result she attended part of the sessions every day that it operated during her holiday.

'We sincerely apologise to Mrs Moissard and her family for the inconvenience caused, and have offered her a full refund which she has accepted.  Club Magic Life welcomes thousands of children to its kids’ clubs every year, with the vast majority of customers rating the staff as good or excellent.'
