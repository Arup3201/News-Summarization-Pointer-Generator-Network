A Florida officer was arrested Thursday for the alleged rape of a 20-year-old woman at gunpoint on duty, police said. 

Officer Stephen Maiorino, 35, is accused of demanding oral sex from his victim under threat of arrest and pinning her to the hood of his police cruiser while he sexually assaulted her.

An eight-year veteran of Boynton Beach police who once starred in an episode TruTV's 'Most Shocking,' Maiorino met his victim after the driver of the car she was in was arrested for a DUI, the Sun Sentinel reports.

Most shocking: Stephen Maiorino, 35, an eight-year veteran of Boynton Beach police who once starred in an episode of TruTV's Most Shocking, is accused of raping a woman at gunpoint

Maiorino was called to pick up the woman early on the evening of October 15 and take her to the police station, where family members were waiting, according to the police affidavit.

When the two arrived at the station, Maiorino 'grabbed her wrist and told her to perform oral sex on him to avoid being arrested herself' for DUI 'even though she had done nothing wrong', she claims.

The woman told investigators she complied out of fear, the affidavit goes on to state, but Maiorino still didn't let her go. 

He drove off to a secluded area in a field, and ordered the woman to strip before he pinned her down to the hood of the police cruiser with his right hand, she testified in the report.

The victim said that during the alleged assault, she turned to look back to see Maiorino holding a gun in his left hand.

Afterwards, as she got dressed, she said that Maiorino pointed the gun at her and threatened to kill and her family if she told anyone about the assault, according to the affidavit.

Disturbed and disgusted: Boynton Beach Police Chief Jeffrey Katz said the department had suspended Maiorino and said he would be fired

Police received a complaint six hours later and began investigating the claim the next morning with the help of the woman.

Investigators found a condom wrapper and condom allegedly used by Maiorino in the secluded area that the woman led them to. 

Police also reviewed radio communications from Maiorino and found 54 minutes elapsed between when he picked up the woman and when he dropped her off. 

At 6:36pm, he called over the radio saying he was bringing her to the police station, and at 7:30pm dropped her off, said police. The woman was originally stranded only 20 blocks from the station. 

Maiorino did not speak to investigators but consented to a DNA swab and handed over clothing, a police report said.

Early testing indicates that DNA found on the condom, the condom wrapper and Maiorino's underwear matches that of the woman, the affidavit states. 

Maiorino, who records indicate is married, turned himself in on Thursday. Police Chief Jeffrey Katz said he is currently on administrative leave and 'will be fired.'

The cop was also charged with armed sexual battery, armed kidnapping and unlawful compensation or reward for official behavior. 

'I would like to say that I am both disturbed and disgusted by the nature of the complaint, the findings of the investigation, and indeed the very prospect that a law enforcement officer could possibly exploit this trust in such a vile and inexcusable way,' read a statement from Katz.

A personnel file released by the city showed that Maiorino began having disciplinary problems starting in 2011.

He was suspended for two days that year for unsatisfactory performance and for mishandling evidence. He was suspended again in 2012 for violating prisoner transport and pursuit policy. 

The department also noted his patrol car was also involved in several crashes, and earlier this year struck a fire hydrant.
