The unbearable frustration of Andy Carroll’s time at West Ham is perhaps best summed up by the red card in this fixture last season when, no sooner was he fit than he was suspended, a victim of Chico Flores’ acting prowess.

That campaign was doomed to never get going, for Carroll. He came back, scored a couple, missed the World Cup and was injured again.

There have been times when this season has threatened to go the same way and then there was on Sunday when Carroll lit the claret-and-blue touch-paper with his first goals of the season, two quite brilliant headers, to propel his team into the top three.

Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski is shown a straight red card by referee Chris Foy after denying Diafra Sakho a goalscoring chance

Fabianski ran from his goal and impeded Sakho as he raced past Ashley Williams towards goal. Sakho stayed on his feet and struck the post with his shot from a tight angle. Referee Chris Foy pulled play back and showed Fabianski a straight red card

Little wonder he reacted with such exhilaration after his second, sprinting to embrace Sam Allardyce’s backroom team as a gesture of thanks to the medics who helped him through the months of injury gloom.

Carroll wiped out Wilfried Bony’s opener with a giant leap and a trademark flex of the neck muscles and a flick of the ponytail in response to a cross by Carl Jenkinson, and won the game with another nostalgia-inducing climb to convert Stewart Downing’s corner, 23 minutes from time.

Not since Duncan Ferguson has the elite level of English football seen anyone attack the aerial ball quite like Carroll and it was a thrill to see him once again dominating airspace, terrorising centre-halves Ashley Williams and Kyle Bartley with his physical presence.

Allardyce drooled on about the lost art of heading the ball. Roy Hodgson will watch with interest over the winter months. It is more than two years since his last England cap.

Diafra Sakho, back from injury, added West Ham’s third, his eighth in 10 games since signing from Metz in August, but not before he had been involved in Lukasz Fabianski’s sending off, which left the visitors a man short for the final 20 minutes.

Fabianski dashed from his penalty box after Sakho had evaded Williams in pursuit of a pass from Carroll. Garry Monk later claimed it was handball as he nudged it past the ‘keeper but Sakho stumbled, but the striker kept his feet and shot from a tight angle.

The ball hit a post, but referee Chris Foy had already blown his whistle for a free-kick to the home team and showed Fabianski a red card. Fourth official Mike Dean told Allardyce that Sakho’s effort would have been ruled out had it gone in.

Monk vowed to appeal the decision. He wanted to know how it could be judged a clear goal-scoring opportunity if he didn’t score. Regardless, the damage was done, even if the visitors rallied briefly before going under.

Sakho, returning from injury as a half-time sub, was a menace on the break against 10 men. He escaped Williams again to pick up a pass by Alex Song and hit the other post before he finally grabbed the third, in the 87th minute, set up by Carroll’s pass.

It glossed the score-line nicely on a fabulous day for West Ham. They have won three in a row, they are third for the first time in 15 years, Carroll is fit, Sakho cannot stop scoring and they are have the look of a strong and solid squad, capable of converting this burst of form into a memorable season.

Two on-loan players also impressed: Arsenal’s Jenkinson rampaging forward from right-back and Barcelona’s Alex Song dominating the ball in central areas of the pitch.

Song’s vision and passing was excellent, almost good enough to forgive his infuriating habit of throwing up his hands in dismay whenever a team-mate failed to read his thoughts or produce a finish to match his pass.

The pair linked up for Carroll’s equaliser after Swansea had taken a 19th minute lead, a slick counter-attack led by Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jefferson Montero into the space behind Jenkinson and converted by Bony.

Once the Ivorian applied a firm side-footer to Montero’s cross and there was never any doubt where it would end up. It was his seventh goal in nine Premier League games.

His game oozed such swagger and confidence that it was a shock when he missed the target from 20 yards, a few minutes later, when Cheikhou Kouyate had been dispossessed, deep inside his own half.

Carroll’s self-esteem has not been fuelled by a similar glut of goals since his permanent £15million move from Liverpool. It has been a difficult time, blighted by injuries, but he led the line well yesterday and dominated in the air from the start.

When Jenkinson crossed from the right and Carroll dropped away from the centre-halves to climb high above Angel Rangel to direct a text-book centre-forward’s header back across goal, into the opposite top corner.

It was his first of the season and his first at Upon Park since March 2013, when he was on loan from Liverpool.

Bony rattled the bar on the break with a ferocious drive, but Carroll appeared unmarked at a corner to head West Ham into the lead. Monk fumed about his team’s defending and that fact they had failed to reach their usual levels, but Carroll can have that sort of effect on defenders, when he is fit and in the groove.
