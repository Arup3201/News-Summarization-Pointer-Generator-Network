A British adventure-seeker on a round-the-world cycle trip has died after being hit by a 4x4 in Bolivia while her husband tailed her a few metres behind.

Sharon Bridgman, 38, died instantly after being struck by the Toyota Land Cruiser on a dirt track near the world's largest salt flats - the famous Uyuni - in the south west of the country close to the border with Chile.

She and husband Tim, from Zeal Monachorum near Okehampton, Devon, were nearly two years into a fundraising cycle trip for Cornwall-based disaster relief charity ShelterBox spanning 32 countries across three continents.

Tragedy: The 38-year-old died instantly after being struck by the Toyota Land Cruiser on a dirt track near the world's largest salt flats while her husband tailed around 200 metres behind

The couple were on the 19,000 mile-leg of the trip from south America to north Alaska when charity worker Sharon was struck from behind and knocked off her bike, just after 4.30pm on Saturday.

The unnamed Bolivian man involved in the accident was arrested at the scene and is now in custody awaiting a court appearance.

A local police spokesman said the accident happened after Sharon swerved to the left and caught the him by surprise.

Last night members of Okehampton Cycling Club, which the couple have belonged to for nearly a decade, spoke of their shock at the news.

Club chairman Robert Szembek said: 'I only found out about the tragedy yesterday and am still in a state of shock.

'Everyone was following an Internet blog they were writing and they appeared to be having a great time and making lots of new friends.

'They'd already done what I would describe as some of the more dangerous countries on their route through Africa without any real problems.

'Tim had his bike stolen at one point and had to have a replacement flown out but that was the worst thing that had happened.

'My heart goes out to him. I haven't been able to talk to him but it goes without saying that he must be suffering immensely.'

A friend added: 'They'd been cycling virtually non-stop since June 2012 but were going to break their journey in early July to come back to Britain for a friend's wedding.

'I don't know what he'll do now. All we've been told is that Sharon has been killed but we don't really know any more details than that.'

Adventurers: Mrs Bridgman wife her carpenter husband Tim in Nordkapp, Norway, on June 4, 2012, the first day of their rouind-the-world trip

Carpenter Tim set off with his wife from Nordkapp in Norway on June 4 2012.

They cycled nearly 16,000 miles through 23 countries in Europe and Africa including Turkey, Egypt, Sudan and war-torn Ethiopia before arriving in Cape Agulhas in South Africa last November.

They then took a plane to Ushuaia in southern Argentina to start their 19,000 mile ride, called the 'North to North cycle tour', to northern Alaska.

Sharon, who did most of the writing, told in a diary entry on their travel blog posted just five days before Sunday's tragedy how they had spent a night on the outskirts of Chilean capital Santiago with firefighters before heading to meet a friend they had made earlier on their trip.

She joked how Tim was taunted by a mosquito 'that had been on a three-week diet and was trying to catch up on many missed meals' in a farewell sign-off.

Describing a hair-raising moment in an April 2013 post, written near the Ethiopian town of Sodo, Tim told how around 50 kids ran alongside them on a dirt track trying to grab their belongings from their bike and throwing stones at them.

He wrote: 'We were close to the edge of town when one hit Sharon on the head.

'It was the last straw. We stopped and tried explaining our thoughts to the adults but they just smiled and shrugged their shoulders.

'It was like riding through wild animals.'

Sharon, who rode from Land's End to John O'Groats with her husband in 2005, had to give up impact sports several years ago because of serious back problems.

The problems forced her to take seven months off work in 2007 and she had several spinal injections to help ease the pain.

Speaking shortly before they set out, Tim said: 'Standing for a long period of time is still a problem but cycling seems to be the one thing that is okay.

'With determination and incredible support from family and friends over the years it has become managable enough to do this trip.'

Local police chief Marcelo Tejerina confirmed: 'Mrs Bridgman died just after 4pm on Saturday local time after being hit by a Toyota Land Cruiser driven by a Bolivian man on a dirt track near Villamar, around 125 miles south of Uyuni. She was killed instantly.

'Her husband who was cycling around 200 metres behind was unhurt.

'The driver stopped and called police. He has now been arrested and his vehicle impounded which is standard practice after a fatal road accident and he is in custody awaiting a court appearance scheduled to take place later today.

'Both the driver and the tourist were travelling in the same direction from Villamar to Uyuni and were about 125 miles from the Chilean border.

'Mrs Bridgman appears to have swerved to the left for reasons that are unclear and taken the driver by surprise.'

British diplomats are understood to be assisting Mr Bridgman. His wife's body has been flown to the Bolivian capital La Paz ahead of its repatriation to the UK.

The city of Uyuni is a major tourist draw for holidaymakers visiting the nearby salt flat, which sits near the top of the Andes at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level.

It is the world's largest salt flat, covering more than 4,000 square miles and containing up to 70 per cent of the world's lithium reserves.

At the time of her death, Sharon and her husband had raised just over £1,000 of their £10,000 target for ShelterBox.

The charity provides emergency shelter and vital supplies to support communities around the world overwhelmed by disaster and humanitarian crisis.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Bolivia on April 26.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
