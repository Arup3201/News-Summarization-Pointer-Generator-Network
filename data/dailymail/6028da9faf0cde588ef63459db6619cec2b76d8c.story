Petra Kvitova held off an injured Eugenie Bouchard to win Wuhan Open title 6-3 6-4 in a rematch of the most lopsided Wimbledon final in two decades.

The Czech player dropped just three games in a 55-minute victory at the All England Club in June but was made to work much harder for her third title of the year.  

Kvitova broke early in the second set to go up 2-0, but seemed to lose her rhythm after Bouchard injured her finger during a rally and began mixing up the pace on her shots.
