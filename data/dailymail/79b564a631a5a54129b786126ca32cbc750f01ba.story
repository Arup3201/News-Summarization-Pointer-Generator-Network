Train travellers have reacted angrily as they face fare rises of up to 10 per cent from this week - but rather than having sympathy for them, the transport minister has claimed the increase is ‘only right’.

Norman Baker countered the damning evidence from pressure groups of overcrowding and poor punctuality by insisting the Government is carrying out its biggest rail investment in two centuries.

The 55-year-old Liberal Democrat added that ministers are ‘determined to reduce the cost of running the railways’ in the longer term so ‘we can end the era of above-inflation fare rises’.

Mr Baker said: ‘Family budgets are 
being squeezed, so that is why this coalition Government has taken 
proactive steps to cut the planned fare rises from 3 to 1 per cent above
inflation until 2014.

‘This decision puts an average of £45 
per year back into the pockets of over a quarter of a million annual 
season ticket-holders.

‘Many more holders of weekly and 
monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters 
could be over £100 better off.’

Research by The Times found season tickets on some rail services have gone up by 40 per cent since the start of the recession. And car park charges are rising by 25 per cent year-on-year.

The Railfuture campaign group says 
season tickets will increase by an average of 4.2 per cent on Wednesday,
the tenth above-inflation increase in a row.

The Association of Train Operating 
Companies (ATOC) says the overall average rise, including non-season 
tickets, will be 3.9 per cent, but with some non-season-ticket fares 
allowed to be increased by an unlimited amount, Railfuture said tickets 
could go up by 10 per cent.

Analysis by campaigners suggested that average train fares have soared by 
more than 26 per cent since the start of the recession – a lower figure than reported by the Times, although it is still suggesting a rate almost three 
times faster than wages.

Some 
commuters are paying £5,000 a year just to get to work - and many will now be paying £1,000 extra than in 2008.

The Campaign for Better Transport says
the UK has the highest train fares in Europe, with some UK tickets 
almost ten times the price of equivalent fares on the Continent.

Rail bosses have been accused of 
‘spinning’ the full extent of the rises and ‘burying bad news’ by 
insisting the average increase would be 3.9 per cent.

So-called ‘unregulated fares’, which 
include some off-peak trips, can be raised to any figure train companies
choose. Many of these will far exceed the 3.9 per cent ‘average’ rise –
with some soaring nearly 10 per cent.

Railfuture spokesman Bruce Williamson said: ‘Yet again, rail fares go up with no perceptible improvement in service.

‘Over the last ten years, fares have increased by more than 50 per cent – much more than people’s incomes.

‘Meanwhile, petrol tax is frozen and 
overall the cost of driving remains static. How does this help persuade 
people out of their cars and ease congestion? Where is the green 
policy?’

Train passengers have endured 
widespread disruption, cancellations and delays over Christmas and New 
Year – as well as pleas by rail bosses not to travel unless absolutely 
necessary – caused by a combination of flooding, weather and engineering
works.

And damning government figures published this month named and shamed the most crammed ‘cattle-class’ services.

New ‘real time’ punctuality figures 
have also shown that the worst-performing train companies are running 
fewer than half their services on time.

This year regulated fares, which
include season tickets, can be increased by the retail price index 
(RPI) inflation rate in July plus one percentage point. This gives the 
average figure of 4.2 per cent.

Mr Williamson said: ‘Annual increases 
should be limited to no more than the rate of inflation, and that should
be the consumer price index (CPI) not RPI, because that’s the lower 
figure and pensions benefits and salaries are all linked to CPI.’

From Wednesday, fares are also going up by an average of 4.2 per cent on the London Underground and buses.

Mayor Boris Johnson said: ‘Investment 
on the transport network will help us to provide faster, more frequent 
and reliable journeys for Londoners and is crucial to economic 
development and growth.’
