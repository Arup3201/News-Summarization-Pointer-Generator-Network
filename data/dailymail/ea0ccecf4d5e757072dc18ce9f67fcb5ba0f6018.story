I've not played a game of cricket since I left school and so was a bit concerned when I was invited to play at the Bodo Schloss vs Raffles end of summer cricket match.

For those of you who don't live in Kensington & Chelsea these are two of the biggest nightclubs in the Royal Borough, and there's a fierce rivalry between the two, so this looked like becoming a bit of grudge match.

So much so that my team Bodo Schloss employed the services of Surrey & England cricketer Jade Dernbach. This and the fact that I hadn't bowled a ball for at least eight years made me worry that I might end up letting the side down a bit.

These concerns left me when I got a wicket on my first ball - I got a nice bit of movement by the off stump, the batsman caught an edge and was picked up in the slips.

Our innings was looking pretty good when Hugo Taylor fell to Dernbach – at least he could say he was bowled by an England cricketer.

I've got to say Hugo did look impressive in whites – like a young Jeremy Irons in Brideshead Revisited, only with a deep St Tropez tan.

Jamie however let the Bodo side down, sartorially at least, by wearing his baseball cap back to front when he was keeping wicket, and his pre-match warm-up involved a cold bottle of beer.

Bizarrely Jamie bumped into Gordon Ramsay who just happened to be walking past the ground, just behind Sloane Square. It has been noted several times before that the pair bear a slight resemblance, but the Twitter rumours are not true – Gordon is not Jamie's father.

It was all down-hill after lunch – there was a humiliating defeat in the lunchtime tug of war. If anything my Forza fitness and weight-loss regime hasn't helped me here. You need a bit of heft behind you for this 'sport' and I've lost nearly a stone with the Forza T5 Super Strength and even though I'm much more toned, it's sheer bulk that you need to win this game.

I was second in the row and kept my position but the guys behind lost their balance and the whole line collapsed and got dragged rather unceremoniously across the out-field.

Spencer says that Jamie was showing him up by wearing a backwards baseball cap

This drubbing in the tug of war must have hit us hard psychologically. Our batting order collapsed in the same that we did with a rope in our hands. I only managed to score three runs and we lost by 165 to 85.

We drowned our sorrows with some champagne ice lollies afterwards.

Lots of love, Spencer.
