It took an adoption and a wedding for internet mogul Kim Dotcom to get his famous last name.

One of the more surprising stories to come out of Dotcom's bail hearing at Auckland District Court on Thursday was how the internet entrepreneur got his surname.

Born Kim Schmitz in West Germany, Dotcom changed his name to Kim Tim Jim Vestor when he applied for a Finnish passport to mirror his company which was called Kimvestor.

The court heard how the internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom got his surname

While living in the Philippines, he heard about a man with the last name Dotcom, the internet entrepreneur told the court.

He asked whether it would be possible for the man to adopt him so he could take on the last name Dotcom.

The process was going to be difficult, so the man instead adopted the mogul's now-estranged wife Mona, who'd never been acknowledged by her birth father.

It comes after his estranged wife Mona Dotcom filed a $20 million legal claim for cash and assets

Dotcom is the founder of Megaupload, which allowed users to download movies, music, e-books and TV shows 

Kim and Mona wed, and Kim applied to take the name of his wife in 2005 at the Finnish Embassy in Hong Kong.

'I simply thought Kim Dotcom was the cooler name,' Dotcom told the court on Thursday.

It comes after his estranged wife filed a $20 million legal claim for cash and assets including luxury cars and millions of dollars seized in an armed raid on their New Zealand mansion they once shared.

Dotcom is accused of $175 million copyright theft from pirated copies of movies, music, e-books and TV shows and is the founder of Megaupload, which allowed users to download the material.
