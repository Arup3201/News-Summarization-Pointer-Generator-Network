A military wife has given her husband a saucy surprise by stripping down to her underwear for a photo shoot.

Sam Shand, 44, from Lincolnshire, used to be so self conscious she even refused to have photographs taken at her wedding to husband John, an RAF police officer.

But after John was posted to Afghanistan for a six-month tour she missed him so much that she plucked up the courage to pose for the sexy snaps.

She had the tasteful photos of her posing in lingerie done and sent an album as a surprise for John, 44, who is now having one of the snaps tattooed on his calf.

Sam had the photo shoot done by Barnsley-based Helen Booth who runs Masque Photography.

'I’m hopeless at having my photo taken, I really don’t like it,' said Sam. 'It bothers me so much we didn't have a photographer at our wedding.

'It was a really big step for me to have photos taken professionally but also scantily clad because I am very conscious of my body.

'I thought I needed to do something to boost my ego and to cheer up John in Afghanistan.

'I came across Helen's website, and the fact she is a woman was a bit plus point. I couldn't have done this with a male photographer.

'I didn't tell John, and sent the photos as a complete surprise. Whenever he felt low he would look at the photos in his tent to cheer himself up, and that was the whole point of sending them.

'Communication is limited in Afghanistan, and it’s not the same as having the person next to you.

'Really, the photos were an ego boost for me, especially as we didn't have any wedding photos.'

She added: 'If you speak to any military wife you get to a low ebb when your partner is away. The initial first two weeks is a novelty and you go back to being a single person coping on your own.

'But halfway through the tour the loneliness kicks in, not just for me but for John too.'

Helen's package also includes a makeover from a professional hair and makeup stylist. She said: 'Boudoir photography is a must-do experience for women who like to treat themselves to a good old fashioned confidence boost.

Sam says doing the raunchy shoot has vastly improved her self confidence

'We put a huge emphasis on having a fabulous experience, as well as amazing photographs at the end of it. I love seeing women blossom in front of me and hearing their reactions once they have seen the photographs.

'Let's face it, it takes some courage to pose in your lingerie and have your photograph taken. I usually find that after the initial few shots any nerves my clients have fade and it becomes a really enjoyable experience.'
