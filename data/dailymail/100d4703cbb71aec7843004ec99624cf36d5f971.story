A baby chihuahua has been reunited with her dognapped mother after thieves abandoned her in a local park.

Chanel was only nine days old when her mother Sophie was taken in a raid on their home - and was so upset she refused to eat and wouldn't stop crying.

But three days later, their owner Mara Almeida, of Rush Green, east London, received a phone call to say two-and-a-half-year-old Sophie had been abandoned in a park on National Puppy Day. 

Puppy Chanel was only nine days old when her mother Sophie was taken in a raid on their home - but the pair have now been reunited after thieves abandoned the dog at a park in Dagenham, east London

Ms Almeida, 33, and her partner Alex Santos, 32, had £40,000 worth of possessions - including two Rolex watches worth £10,000 each - stolen by burglars. 

But all they asked for is to have Sophie back so she could feed her puppy - and even offered a £1,000 reward for her safe return.

The mother-of-five said: 'I'm so happy now. The puppy is so happy she's back with her mum now.

'She had stopped eating without her but now she's eating again.

'We offered a £1,000 reward - I was going to sell my car to get the money - but the couple who found it turned it down.

'They were just happy Sophie was back with her pup.'

Colin Peacock had been walking with his wife Gladys, 59, when their German Sheppard Saber took interest in a cardboard box left in a park in Dagenham, east London, on Tuesday morning.

Mr Peacock, 60, said: 'Saber started sniffing this box in the park she was taking a real interest.

'I opened it up and in there was this little dog. It was a bit of a shock.

'I took it down to the PDSA and saw the poster on the wall about Sophie and called Mara up.

'She was in floods of tears. One of the kids said, 'Do you want money', but I didn't do it for that. The main thing is they got their dog back - that's what it's about.'

Ms Almeida had been trying to feed Chanel with a baby's milk bottle following the raid at her home on Saturday but the puppy refused to drink it.

Police are investigating the burglary, but have yet to make an arrest or find the stolen items.
