Designer: Alexandre Herchcovitch claims to have developed a pair of jeans that combats cellulite

They would appear to be the answer to many womenâ€™s prayers - a pair of stylish jeans that can smooth away cellulite.

Brazilian designer Alexandre Herchcovitch claims to have developed the worldâ€™s first jeans that combat the dreaded 'orange peel'.

His so-called 'beauty denim' harnesses body heat and turns it into infrared rays that are relayed back to the skin and stimulates the areas most at risk from cellulite.

The effect, he claims, is to increase microcirculatory blood flow and cellular metabolism and so prevent cellulite from building up.

Unveiling the anti-cellulite jeans at a fashion show in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Mr Herchcovitch claims five years of research into the product has proved it is effective.

However, medical experts are skeptical, saying there is no miracle cure for cellulite which can be caused by poor diet, bad circulation and slow metabolism.

Cellulite is thought to affect around 90
 per cent of women over the age of 30 in Britain - with a range of 
lotions, creams and even surgery aimed at combating it.

Herchcovitchâ€™s jeans use a manmade 
fibre called Emana yarn that was developed in Brazil and has already 
been used in sports clothing and lingerie.

The synthetic Emana yarn is said to absorb the electromagnetic waves emitted by the human body, known as Far Infrared Rays.

When these invisible rays come into contact with the body they provide stimulation of tissue - therefore preventing a buildup of cellulite.

Leggings made from Emana yarn can be bought in the UK from an online retailer and are sold at Harrods.

Herchcovitch has not said when his designer jeans will be on sale or how much they will cost.

But he is not the first fashion label to try and market a pair of jeans that can eradicate cellulite.

In
 2004, the Miss Sixty clothing company introduced a range of jeans, 
trousers and skirts which it claimed could smooth away cellulite.

Its products contained an 'anti-cellulite serum' called Skintex made from retinol. 

Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A which is used in many skincare products to stimulate collagen production.

'Marketing ploy': In 2004, Miss Sixty introduced a range of jeans, trousers and skirts which it claimed could smooth away cellulite. However, medical experts dismissed the clothing line as a marketing ploy

MIss Sixty claimed when the wearer of the jeans moved, the friction made the Skintex capsules burst.

This released cream which was then absorbed into the skin.

However, medical experts dismissed the clothing line as a 'marketing ploy' and it was dropped after a year.
