A remarkable photo album showing German airmen quaffing champagne and getting steaming drunk during the First World War have been come to light.

The black and white snaps depict the men in uniform having a raucous time in their mess, far removed from the misery of the trenches on the Western Front.

The officers of the Imperial German Flying Corps are seen smoking cigars and cigarettes and having a good old knees up in the incredibly rare photo collection which is being put up for auction.

Dangerous job: It seems the German pilots adopted a similar philosophy to their British counterparts: 'Live for today, tomorrow we die'

Finally found: The unique images of the German pilots kept in a 14inch by 12inch album were found in a box of personal effects inherited by a man in Essex from a relative. It is believed the album was kept by a British serviceman after the Germans surrendered in 1918

Coming just 11 years after the first ever flight by the Wright brothers, air warfare was a new but very risky concept during the First World War.

It was said the men of the British Royal Flying Corps’ adopted the philosophy of ‘live for today, tomorrow we die’, such was the deadly nature of their job.

And judging by the dozens of rare photos that have emerged, it seems their German counterparts also had a similar attitude to wartime life.

There are several group photos depicting the men guzzling bottles of champagne and glasses of beer and liquor.

In one amusing image, all 10 German 
officers appear to be in a drunken stupour, with four of them hugging 
each other and singing out loud while another looks like he has passed 
out.

In another, a line of four inebriated flyers lean to one side as they lose their balance while sitting for the camera.

The large album contains about 130 snaps and others do show the serious side of the war. There is a poignant picture of the grave of one German airman with a plane propeller placed on it as a marker.

Another photo shows two airmen wrapped 
up in large overcoats and scarfs as they prepare to climb into the 
exposed cockpit of their bi-plane and go into battle.

And several snaps some of the devastating damage to train lines and bridges as a result of air bombing over norther France.

The identities of the airmen aren’t known although they were part of 24 and 54 squadrons of the German Flying Corps or the Die Fliegertruppen.

It is known that some of the photos were taken in December 1917 as a Christmas tree and decorations can be seen in them.

Some of the pilots' obvious mantra to live life to the fullest is not surprising considering the high mortality rate for those in the air force. 

During World War One, aircrew casualties, who were killed, missing or taken prisoner, totalled 8,604 and a further 7,302 were wounded.

By the end of the war, the German Army 
Air Service possessed a total of 2,709 frontline aircraft, 56 airships, 
186 balloon detachments and about 4,500 flying personnel.

In total 3,126 aircraft, 546 
balloons and 26 airships had been lost during the duration of the conflict.

After the war ended in German defeat, 
the service was dissolved completely on May 8, 1920, under the 
conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, which demanded that its 
aeroplanes be completely destroyed.

The rare collection of photos contained in a 14ins by 12ins album was found in a box of personal effects inherited by a man in Essex from a late relative.

It is thought the album was seized as a souvenir by a British serviceman after the Germans surrendered in 1918 and was kept in his family.

It is being sold by Essex auctioneers Reeman Dansie and has a pre-sale estimate of £1,500.

James Grinter, of Reeman Dansie, said: 'I have never seen anything like this photo album before.

'If it was a Royal Flying Corps album, then it would be rare but to have a German one from the same period is unheard of.

'The survival rate of these flyers was terrible and it looks like these men lived life to the full while they had the chance.

'It is a very important and historical record and is unusual because there are a lot of natural and relaxed pictures rather than the staged and formal photos of that period.

'It gives you a feel of what it was like to have been there. It wouldn’t surprise me if this album ended up going into a museum because it is so rare.'  The auction takes place on Thursday.

Destruction: A photograph showing the damage from several bombs was also in the album alongside pictures of the pilots making merry. It is not known where this picture was taken

In the midst of war: A bridge can be seen collapsing into a river after a bomb hit during World War One. It is not know where this image was taken

In ruins: Weapons and equipment can be seen by a railway line which has been destroyed by a bomb during WWI. It is believed the image was taken by a German soldier

Legendary: German fighter pilot Baron Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the 'Red Baron', was considered to be one of the best flyers in World War One with 80 air combat victories to his name

The Imperial German Flying Corps 
(IGFC) - Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches in German - was 
founded in 1910 when the Germany acquired its first military aircraft.

They were initially responsible for 
reconnaissance and artillery spotting in support of armies on the 
ground, just as balloons had been used during the Franco-Prussian War of
1870–1871 and even as far back as the Napoleonic Wars.

The IGFC formed the basis of what would become the German Air Force (Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte) in 1916, which was the air arm of the German army during World War One.

The Air Force drastically expanded 
during the war to accommodate the new types of aircraft, doctrine, 
tactics and the needs of the ground troops, in particularly the 
artillery.

During
1916, the German High Command, in response to the then current Allied 
air superiority, reorganised their forces by creating several types of 
specialist units in 1916.

Most
notable were the single seat fighter squadrons or 'Jastas' which is 
short for Jagdstaffel - literally meaning 'hunting squadron' - in order 
to counter the offensive operations of the Royal Flying Corps and the 
French Aviation Militaire.

On
June 24, 1917, the Luftstreitkräfte formed its first fighter wing, the 
Royal Prussian Jagdgeschwader I and more units quickly followed. 

And just like their British counterpart, the German Air Force had famous fighter pilots who inspired bravery in their comrades and struck fear into the heart of the enemy.

And Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen, better known as the Red Baron, was considered to be the best.

The German fighter pilot is considered German's top ace of World War One - being officially credited with 80 air combat victories.

Originally a cavalryman, Richthofen transferred to the Air Service in 1915, becoming one of the first members of Jasta 2 single seat fighter pilots in 1916.

He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, and during 1917 became leader of Jasta 11 and then the larger unit Jagdgeschwader 1 - better known as the 'Flying Circus'.

By 1918, he was regarded as a national hero in Germany, and was very well known by the other side.

Richthofen was shot down and killed near Amiens on 21 April 1918.

There has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career, especially the circumstances of his death. He remains perhaps the most widely known fighter pilot of all time, and has been the subject of many books, films and other media.

By
the end of the war, the German Army Air Service possessed a total of 
2,709 frontline aircraft, 56 airships, 186 balloon detachments and about
4,500 flying personnel.

Casualties
totalled 8,604 aircrew killed or missing or taken prisoner, 7,302 
wounded with 3,126 aircraft, 546 balloons and 26 airships lost.

Some 5,425 Allied aircraft and 614 kite balloons were destroyed.

After
the war ended in German defeat, the service was dissolved completely on
May 8, 1920, under the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, which 
demanded that its aeroplanes be completely destroyed.
