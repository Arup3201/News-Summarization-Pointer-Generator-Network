He was accused by a fellow MEP this week of having a ‘weakness for women’.

Now Nigel Farage has been criticised by another for using public money to employ both his wife and his ‘former mistress’.

The Ukip leader was alleged to have had an affair with his spin doctor Annabelle Fuller, 32, who recently tried to explain the distinction between a ‘slag’ and a ‘slut’ following a row at the party conference.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage dismissed claims he was employing his former mistress on Brussels allowances as 'absolute nonsense'

Mr Farage, 49, has two children with his second wife, German national Kirsten Mehr, who he married in 1999 and who works as his secretary.

But independent MEP Nikki Sinclaire asked in the European Parliament: ‘With unemployment still a problem across Europe and indeed across the UK, does Mr Farage think it is a fair use of taxpayers’ money, namely his secretarial allowance, not only to employ his wife Kirsten but his former mistress Annabelle Fuller?’

Mr Farage replied: ‘I don’t want to answer that at all, thank you.’

The extraordinary allegation comes just days after Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom said: ‘We all have our foibles and our weaknesses – mine is real ale, I’ve never been partial to crumpet.

'Nigel’s is women. It’s not something he ever denied.’

The Ukip leader and Miss Fuller fiercely denied the claims of an affair, but Mrs Farage seemed less certain when asked at the large semi-detached family home near Westerham, Kent.

She said: ‘Nigel’s just on his way back from Strasbourg and we will be discussing it tonight, I’m sure. I don’t want to comment today.’

Rumours about Miss Fuller’s close friendship with Mr Farage have swirled since she was appointed by the party in 2006, soon after graduating from the University of London.

She broke down in tears in 2008 after revealing she had received ‘threatening’ telephone calls accusing of her of being a ‘whore’, in what she claimed was part of a vicious two-year smear campaign aimed at undermining Mr Farage.

Mr Farage said he had faced questions about his relationship with Miss Fuller since 2006 but insisted 'it is not true'

The former public schoolgirl left Ukip because of the claims but remained a well-known socialite around Westminster.

Three years ago, she accused Tory MP Andrew Bridgen of groping her on the balcony of his flat close to the Commons.

He was arrested but the case was later dropped and Mr Bridgen has always strongly denied all the allegations.

Miss Fuller later waived her right to anonymity and said her life had been ‘destroyed’ by the incident and that she had been branded a ‘fantasist.’

After leaving Ukip, she started a public relations firm, Athena PR, which boasts a recommendation from Mr Farage on its website praising her ability to ‘resolve issues which may arise.’

She repaid the compliment by lavishing praise on Mr Farage on the company’s Facebook page for his ability to use social media to engage with new audiences.

Miss Fuller resumed working for Mr Farage last year and soon afterwards they were spotted going for a curry together close to her flat in Muswell Hill, North London.

She was thrown into the spotlight when Mr Bloom was surrounded by journalists after calling a room of women at the party’s conference ‘sluts’. Miss Fuller tried to defend the comment to reporters, saying: ‘I think people don’t understand the difference between “slut” and “slag”. Do you know what the word “slut” means?’

The daughter of a property developer from Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey, Miss Fuller studied at the £13,000-a-year Sir William Perkins’s school in Chertsey before graduating with a BA in political economics and a Masters in international relations from the University of London.

On her YouTube profile, she has also posted footage of pole dancing, saying it’s something she has ‘always wanted to learn.’

She added: ‘It’s a sport that is admittedly erotic, but really celebrates talent and dedication and the art of the female body, and a skill.’

Her company website also offers advice on ‘what to do if a journalist calls’. When the Mail contacted her for comment by phone yesterday, she hung up. She later issued a statement through the Ukip press office strongly criticising Miss Sinclaire, who was born a man before undergoing sex-change surgery in her 20s.

Miss Fuller said: ‘It’s a shame that as a woman I am considered fair game for accusations of alleged affairs. It’s hard enough being a woman in politics without having to justify why I am employed.

‘It is safe to say that this would not have happened if I was a man. Surely this is something that Nikki Sinclaire should have considered.’

Miss Fuller’s mother, Marylyn, refused to come to the door of  her semi-detached home in  Sunbury-on-Thames yesterday. But her uncle Anthony Fuller, who also lives in the commuter town, branded the allegations ‘ridiculous’.

He added: ‘What difference would it make if they had had an affair?’

Mr Farage told the Mail: ‘Every single national newspaper has asked me that question since 2006 and the answer remains the same.

‘It’s not true. It is absolute nonsense. It’s just a malicious attempt to do damage.’ Miss Sinclaire was a member of Ukip but left after a row with Mr Farage.
