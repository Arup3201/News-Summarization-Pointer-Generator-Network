In the United States, a good education comes at a price and whilst it's common knowledge  college costs are on the rise, some schools are now charging more than $60,000 a year to educate a student for just one year.

A list released by the Department of Education lists the colleges and universities with the highest tuition in the country.

New York University, NYU is the country's most expensive school with tuition costing $61,977 a year.

Pricey: The most expensive degrees in nation cost almost $62,000 per year

Four years of hard work and fun: You'll have a degree from one of the America's finest colleges but be down more than quarter of a millions dollars

Other residential colleges often add an extra $10,000 or more for board along with other fees.

The list, compiled by Business Insider lists tuition, required fees, room and board for an entire four-year undergraduate degree.

Of course the numbers are solely what you would pay to the school.

There would still be the costs of books, travel, and and food.

An earlier analysis, by the Department
of Education, ranked NYU 64th among private four-year colleges, but 
that listing just counted tuition.

NYU is followed closely by Harvey Mudd College, part of California's Claremont Colleges, and Bard College in upstate New York.

College education costs have been rising steadily for years, outpacing inflation.

Between
1982-1983 and 2012-2013, tuition and fees for a private four–year 
college education rose 167 percent, and the price tag for a public 
four–year education climbed 257 percent, according to College Board.

Student
loan debt is also a growing problem, particularly now that Congress has
allowed the interest rate on student loans to double.

Less expensive: At 20th on the list, Northwestern in Chicago would cost $217,000 for a four-year course

New York University, $247,908

Harvey Mudd College, $247,040

Bard College, $245,784

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, $243,116

Sarah Lawrence College, $242,624

Wesleyan University, $240,856

Dartmouth College, $240,804

University of Chicago, $240,156

Bard College at Simon's Rock, $240,012

Trinity College, $239.440

Johns Hopkins University, $239,208

Fordham University, $239,208

Carnegie Mellon University, $238,528

University of Southern California, $238,460

Occidental College, $238,368

Scripps College, $238,280

Oberlin College, $237,896

Haverford College, $237,784

Pitzer College, $237,664#

Northwestern University, $217,556

There are many other respectable  colleges that decent value for money when balancing academics with affordability.

Some flagship public universities are on the list and include the University of Florida, the University of Iowa, the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill, the University of Oregon, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

College Board suggested a 'moderate budget' for a school year at a public university to be $22,000, and over $43,000 for a private institution.

Earlier this week the U.S. Senate failed to restore lower interest rates on student loans which means that undergraduates are likely to have to pay rates twice as high as last year.

The White House-backed proposal from Democratic leaders would have left interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans at 3.4 per cent for another year while lawmakers took up a comprehensive overhaul.

The one-year stopgap measure failed to
overcome a procedural hurdle as Republicans — and a handful of 
Democrats — urged colleagues to consider a plan now that would link 
interest rates to the financial markets and reduce Congress' role in 
setting students' borrowing rates.

The
rate increase does not affect many students right away as loan 
documents are generally signed just before students return to campus, 
and few students returned to school over the July Fourth holiday. 
Existing loans were not affected, either.

However,
without any congressional action in the coming weeks, the increase 
could spell an extra $2,600 for an average student returning to campus 
this fall, according to Congress' Joint Economic Committee.

Sunny and 75: At the University of Southern California for $59,000 a year you can attend one of the Golden State's finest learning establishments and great party schools!

During
last year's presidential campaign, lawmakers from both parties voted to
keep interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans at 3.4 per cent.

Yet
this year, without a presidential election looming, the issue seemed to
fizzle and the July 1 deadline passed without action.

The
White House and most Democratic senators favored keeping the rates at 
3.4 per cent for now and including a broad overhaul of federal student 
loans in the Higher Education Act rewrite lawmakers expect to take up 
this fall.
