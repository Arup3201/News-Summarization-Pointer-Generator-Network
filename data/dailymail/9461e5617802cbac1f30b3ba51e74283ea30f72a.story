America's right-wing political pin-up Sarah Palin is to reprise her ratings-busting turn on Saturday Night Live for the show's 40th anniversary special, it is claimed.

Producers have invited the former Alaska governor and onetime vice-presidential hopeful back to the programme and she has accepted, a source close to Mrs Palin told People.com.

It will give Mrs Palin, who no longer holds office but is still active on the Republican right, a chance to spar with Tina Fey, whose uncanny resemblance to the politician was used to lampoon her during the 2008 presidential race.

So which is which? Sarah Palin and Tina Fey in 2008. The right-wing politician is set to appear once again on Saturday Night Live, where she will have the opportunity to joust with lookalike Tina Fey. (Palin is right)

Older and wiser? Mrs Palin pictured in September last year. She no longer holds office but has used her SarahPAC - along with her reality TV programs and Fox News appearances - to keep her name in the mix

Mrs Palin last appeared on Saturday Night Live in 2008, just two weeks before election day - although on that occasion viewers were disappointed when she did not appear side-by-side with Fey.

Still, the anticipation of such a moment sent the programme's ratings soaring to a 14-year high, with about 17million viewers tuning in for the first half hour.

A fresh appearance could be a crafty move to boost her national standing. Mrs Palin, who turned 51 on Monday, recently fanned speculation that she might seek the Republican nomination in 2016.

She has used her SarahPAC - along with her reality television programs and Fox News appearances - to keep her name in the mix and to pay for travel to campaign rallies with allies.

However she is still notorious for the kinds of gaffes that persistently hounded her when she first appeared as John McCain's running mate in 2008.

Just last week her political stock plummetted when she admitted that a rambling and incoherent speech she recently made in Iowa came after her teleprompter froze.

The admission came in a freewheeling television segment with Host Sean Hannity in which she also downplayed reports from days earlier that she was planning to run for president in the first place.

'I was asked by a testy reporter while I was promoting my Sportsman Channel show, Amazing America With Sarah Palin,' the self-promoting pol told Hannity. 'I was asked if I were to be interested at all in running for office, maybe the presidency.'

'And it's certainly not newsworthy,' she added with a shrug and an eye roll, 'for me to have answered, "Oh yeah, I'm interested, yeah. Next question?"

Good sport: Mrs Palin getting into the vibe on her visit SNL appearance. She is still notorious for the kinds of gaffes that persistently hounded her when she first appeared as John McCain's running mate in 2008

But she had been forced to recover from negative headlines when at the Iowa Freedom Summit she flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of odd one-liners, leaving a welcoming audience confused.

'Did the teleprompter go down? Did you have trouble with the copy?' Hannity asked her. 'Was there any moment in the speech where you had any difficulty? Because people have been so critical.'

Palin insisted that 'I don't read the praise and I don't read the criticism. ... I'm used to teleprompters not working.'

The Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary special is due to be broadcast on February 15 at 8pm ET on NBC.
