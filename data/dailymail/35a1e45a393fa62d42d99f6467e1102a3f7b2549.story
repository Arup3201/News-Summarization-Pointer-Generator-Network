A pensioner with cancer has been told he faces a £25,000-a-year bill for treatment because he lives in Wales.

Retired miner Jimmy Chesters, 76, from Wrexham, has spoken out after discovering the price tag for the drug which could prolong his life.

Mr Chesters, who is being treated by doctors in an English hospital, says if he was living in England he could receive the drug Sorefenib, but that he is the victim of a ‘postcode lottery’.

Jimmy Chesters, 76, has bowel cancer and needs the drug Sorefenib to prolong his life. If he lived in England he would receive it free. As he lives in Wales he would have to pay £25,000 a year to access it

Yesterday it was revealed some Welsh patients are being forced to move to England to get life-prolonging cancer drugs.

English patients are four times more likely to get newer cancer drugs than those living in Wales because of special government funding which allows doctors to give drugs not yet given the go-ahead on the NHS.

Government figures show 15,456 patients in England were given money last year by the Cancer Drugs Fund – which pays for treatments that have not yet been approved by NICE, the NHS rationing body.

This works out at 29 people per 100,000.

The Labour-run Welsh Assembly, whose decision to provide free prescriptions left its budget squeezed, has so far refused to implement a similar scheme.

This means just 216 patients in Wales were given money for new cancer drugs by applying for exceptional NHS funding – or seven per 100,000 people.

Mr Chesters, who is being treated by doctors in an English hospital in Birmingham, says that he is the victim of a 'postcode lottery'

Ministers launched the £650million Cancer Drugs Fund three years ago.

Doctors apply on behalf of their patients to get any drug they believe will extend or enhance their lives.

But the fund was a temporary measure and is due to be wound-up in April.

The Government is getting ready to introduce a system of Value-Based Pricing next year, which is expected to give the green-light to more expensive cancer drugs.

Mr Chesters said he was shocked when a doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham told him his drugs would cost £25,000 per year.

‘No working class person could possibly afford that,’ said Mr Chesters.

‘It was certainly a shock to find out it would cost that much.

‘It’s an awful lot of money, impossible to afford.’

Mr Chesters said the potential cost for the Sorafenib drug, also known as Nexavar, could apply each year for the remainder of his life.

Since April 2013 the national Cancer Drugs Fund has approved the use of Sorafenib. But funding only applies to patients living in England.

‘If I was living in England, I’d be able to get this treatment,’ he said. ‘I need this sorting.’

Originally diagnosed with cancerous tumours on the liver several years ago, Mr Chesters now needs treatment as cancer has returned in the muscle of his bowel.

He has been given some help towards covering the cost of the drugs thanks to fundraising taking place in his local community.

‘It has been brilliant that people have done this for me,’ added Mr Chesters.

‘I never realised I was so popular. Everyone has been doing so much for me. I’m very grateful.’

Although living in Wales, Mr Chesters is seen by medics in Birmingham. A spokesman for University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust said they did not wish to add to a statement issued last month.

Mr Chesters said he was shocked when a doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham told him his drugs would cost £25,000 per year. He said: 'No working class person could possibly afford that'

It read: ‘We are unable to comment on individual cases. The Trust does adhere to the national guidelines regarding prescribing.

‘Since April 2013, the national Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) has approved the use of Sorafenib (Nexavar).

‘However, the CDF only applies to those patients living in England and not Wales.’

Patients can apply to an all-Wales panel which will consider if there are grounds for funding a particular medicine or treatment based on their medical history.
