As the threat of a leadership spill continues to dominate conversation in Canberra, some politicians appear to be confused about what side they're on.

Defence Minister Kevin Andrews used a Melbourne press conference to affirm his support for Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Monday after the loyalty of Liberal party members came under question.

However Mr Andrew's statement – that he supports the team of Tony Abbott and former Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard – delighted social media users who did not hold back in their quips on Twitter.

'I believe that the team of Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard is the best leadership team for the Liberal party, and therefore part of the best leadership team of the coalition for the country,' Mr Andrews said during the conference.

The Defence Minister appeared not to notice his own slip, continuing on without flinching or backtracking.

'The Australian people voted for this team, we should respect the decision that the Australian people made.'

Mr Andrews was likely to have been suffering from a bought of déjà vu, as Gillard herself first became prime minister after contesting a leadership spill against Kevin Rudd in 2010.

The slip delighted social media users who instantly took to Twitter 

She survived an attempt to unseat her in 2012, but lost to Mr Rudd in 2013.

Julie Bishop is deputy Liberal leader and foreign minister.

It's not the first slip that has been made about Mr Abbott's leadership recently, with Education Minister Christopher Pyne telling the Today Show on Friday morning that he 'hoped' the prime minister had the numbers behind him.

He later put his comments down to a slip of the tongue because he was 'tired', however Senior Labor figure Anthony Albanese who was also on the show, retorted: 'When you start having senior people who can't say that the Prime Minister has the numbers then it's over.'
