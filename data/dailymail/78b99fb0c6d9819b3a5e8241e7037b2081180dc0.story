Could we one day do away with the traditional guitar for a version with no body or neck?

According to the makers of the world's first all-titanium, futuristic-looking Gittler guitar, that may soon be the case.

The idea of a body-less guitar was the brainchild of a musician and minimalist artist Alan Gittler back in the 1970s.

Gittler’s vision was to strip away individual elements of a functional guitar to find out what lay within the heart that could not be removed.

The world's first all-titanium, futuristic-looking Gittler guitar was the brainchild of a musician and minimalist artist Alan Gittler back in the 1970s. Gittler's vision was to strip away individual elements of a functional guitar to find out what lay within the heart that could not be removed

He discovered that although wood had been used since the guitar's creation, it wasn’t needed for the instrument to the function.

He also believed that electric guitars only look the way they do because nobody has bothered to change them since the 1930s.

‘The basic elements of vibration and gain were the only truly indespensable elements at play when making sound,’ claims New York-based Gittler Instruments.

Everything else, it said, simply existed to shape and mould that sound to the individual player's taste.

By paring the instrument down to the point of pure function, the idea was that it would become more responsive to every nuance of playing, however subtle.

Gittler did away with not only the body but most of the neck and all volume and tone controls.

Now, Gittler's son Jonathan is carrying on his father's legacy by reinventing the bare bones bass.

The latest version of the guitar is manufactured entirely of 6AL-4V aircraft grade titanium.

Like the original design, it has no neck or body - although an acrylic guitar neck can be added, if needed.

Fret marking is done with built-in LED lights installed in tiny cross holes across the guitar's central channel.

An electronic box in the back of the guitar contains a volume wheel, dual tone controls for treble and bass.

The 30.25 inch and three inch wide Gittler guitars are thought to be the world's first model to include six transducers in a single guitar unit.

Gittler Instruments said it is now ready to bring a fully realised concept, and not just a prototype, to the market.

It has launched a campaign via crowdsourcing site Kickstarter to raise $80,000 by November 14.

A $2,000 pledge will get you one of the first Gittler guitars made for the mass market.

Although you'll have to follow that up with another $1,995 payment to receive the instrument, which the group promises will provide a 'guitar playing experience that is out of this world.'
