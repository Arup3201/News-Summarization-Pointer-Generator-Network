Five men who smashed an American student's eye socket with a bottle he was drinking from 'because he was obviously not local' are facing jail today.

Francesco Hounye, 23, had been in Britain just three days when he was attacked by the gang who kicked him in the head as he lay wounded on the ground, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

He was set upon in an area where a 'Muslim patrol' attempting to enforce Sharia law in east London had previously been caught on camera.

But police have stressed that there was no evidence to suggest this attack was a hate crime or motivated by religion in any way.

Francesco Hounye, 23, had been in the UK for just three days when he was set upon by a gang, who smashed a bottle in his face

Detailed CCTV footage captured the attack on the American student by  a group of Asian men

Samad Uddin, 24, Shaleem Uddin, 21, Shadhat Hussain, 20, Kamrul Hussain, 23, and Massom Rahman, 22, targeted the student when they saw him swigging from a bottle of Jagermeister.

Mr Hounye had been out for the night in the Brick Lane area of east London and was walking with a friend to his home in Shadwell in June last year.

He was confronted by the group who wrestled the bottle from him, then chased him and smashed the bottle over his head – leaving him needing 23 stitches in his face.

CCTV footage footage shows Mr Hounye being kicked mercilessly as he lay crouched in the road.

Six months after the attack a demonstration was staged in nearby Brick Lane where around 60 protestors targeted Muslim-owned businesses for selling ‘evil’ alcohol.

Samad Uddin was on trial for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent after the four others admitted their roles in the attack.

But he later changed his plea and admitted the charge.

Shaleem Uddin and Kamrul Hussain both hold previous convictions for assaults in 2010 but they escaped with suspended sentences.

The gang were identified after CCTV surveillance captured the apparently spontaneous group attack

Shadhat Hussain has been before the courts for possession of cannabis and cocaine while Rahman was of previous good character.

The gang were identified after CCTV surveillance captured the apparently spontaneous group attack.

‘All of them were willingly involved in that attack, all of them played a part,’ said prosecutor Paul Casey.

‘Two in particular played the most serious role, Shaleem Uddin and Samad Uddin.

‘Shaleem Uddin used the bottle to strike Mr Hounye over the head, causing him severe cuts to the side of his head.

The student said as a result of the attack he was now too scared to go out on his own in London

‘Immediately prior to that, Samad Uddin and a number of others were involved trying to wrestle the bottle from Mr Hounye.’

‘During the course of the attack Samad Uddin aimed a number of kicks to Mr Hounye whilst he was prone on the ground, including one which CCTV shows his right foot connecting with some force with Mr Hounye’s head.’ 

In the CCTV footage Samad Uddin can be seen taking hold of Mr Hounye’s shoulder.

The victim was then grabbed from behind by a second male and other members of the gang wrestled the bottle from his clutches.

‘The first punches are thrown at Mr Hounye, the bottle is wrestled from him, Shelim Hussain smashes him over the head with the bottle,’ said Mr Casey.

Samad Uddin is seen kicking Mr Hounye across the road after he broke free and attempted to escape.

He was arrested in April this year after he was recognised by a police officer who had seen the CCTV footage, but initially claimed the allegations were as a result of mistaken identity.

Samad Uddin from Shadwell and Shaleem Uddin from Whitechapel have admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Kamrul Hussain from Whitechapel, Shadhat Hussain from Canning Town and Masoom Rahman from Whitechapel also admitted the charge. 

The Metropolitan Police told MailOnline: 'There is no evidence to suggest that this attack was a hate crime or motivated by religion in any way. Speculation to the contrary is wrong and potentially damaging to community relations.'

They said Mr Hounye was assaulted simply because he was 'obviously not local.' 

In a statement, traumatised Mr Hounye, who had come to London to study, said: 'As a result of this incident I am now scared to go out on my own in London.

'I am a visitor to the UK and was considering continuing my studies here but this incident has made me think twice.

'I feel very emotional about the whole situation. I also now face the rest of my life with the permanent scarring that will be left on my face as a result of this attack.

'Every time I look in the mirror from now on I will be reminded of this incident.'

The gang are due to be sentenced later today.
