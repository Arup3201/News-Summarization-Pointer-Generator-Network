The widow of a soldier who was killed by a single punch during a fight in a taxi queue has spoken of her complete forgiveness for his killer.

David Ryding, 26, died after being knocked out by Ben Hartwell, 22, on July 7 this year during a heated row while the pair waited in a taxi queue in Rugby, Warwickshire.

The recently married father-of-one, who fought with the 1st Battalion Mercian Regiment until 2011, hit his head on the ground after being struck by Mr Hartwell. He died in hospital the following day.

An inquest heard Mr Hartwell had acted in 'self-defence' after the confrontation and Warwickshire assistant coroner John Ryan recorded a verdict of 'lawful killing' following a two-day hearing in Leamington.

Following Mr Ryding's death, his widow Nicola, 25, requested a meeting with his killer, where she told him she did not blame him and wanted him to move forward with his life.

She told the inquest her husband had been known to drink to excess after suffering from Post Traumatic Stress following tours in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan.

But giving evidence she said: 'It was out of character for David to be in a fight, I’d never seen him in trouble or aggressive. He would have stuck up for his friends if they were in trouble.'

Speaking after the hearing she added: 'Our family and Mr Hartwell’s family have been deeply affected by the events which took place and just hope that if any good can come from this tragedy, it is that awareness will be raised regarding the tragic results an instantaneous event such as this can lead to.

'Our thoughts are with Mr Hartwell and all his family and we hope he can come to terms with what happened and move on with his life.

'David will be in our hearts for ever and live on in the wonderful memories we shared.

'We are satisfied that the inquest was conducted thoroughly and we respect the verdict made.'

Warwickshire Justice Centre was shown CCTV footage of the pair involved in an initial scuffle at around 5am.

Mr Ryding, from the Wirral, Merseyside, began to move around Mr Hartwell before with his fists raised, throwing several punches which he ducked away from

Mr Ryding, from the Wirral, Merseyside, began to move around Mr Hartwell before with his fists raised, throwing several punches which he ducked away from.

The altercation ended with Mr Hartwell knocking Mr Ryding to the ground with a single punch before walking away.

Mr Hartwell, from Rugby, was originally arrested on suspicion of murder after handing himself into police shortly after the incident.

But the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was no case to answer and Mr Hartwell had acted in self defence.

Mr Hartwell told the inquest: 'I hit him because I was scared. If I hadn’t hit him it could have been me. I felt I was under attack.

'I told them to get back in the taxi and go home, I didn’t want to fight.

'I was hoping he would just leave me alone. It was meant to just keep him away. It wasn’t meant to knock him out, it was instinctive.

'I had never knocked anyone out before, it was horrible. I wouldn’t mean to hurt him, it was a freak accident.'

Detective Inspector Ally Wright, from Warwickshire Police, added: 'On a personal level I also want to thank Nicola Ryding and her family. They remained dignified throughout and have never sought to seek blame or retribution on any individual.

'Nicola has demonstrated incredible courage in requesting a meeting with the male who punched David.

'She told him that she attributes no blame to him and that all she wished for was for his life to move forward.

'As she put it there is no need for another life to be ruined as a result of the terrible incident.'
