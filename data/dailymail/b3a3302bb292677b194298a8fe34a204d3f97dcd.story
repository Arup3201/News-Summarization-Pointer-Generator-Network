Two burglars stole more than £750,000 of equipment from the lockers of golf clubs by posing as players to sneak into changing rooms, a court heard.

Bentley-driving Daniel Lloyd, 43, and Joe McCaughey, 26, broke into more than 1,000 lockers at clubs across 17 counties during their 16-month crime spree.

They stole top-of-the-range clubs and other equipment before selling them on abroad.

Escape: Posing as golfers, the pair then flee carrying thousands of pounds worth of equipment in their bags

Jailed: Lloyd (left), from Bromley, south east London, has been sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, while McCaughey (right), from Croydon, has been jailed for three years

Birmingham Crown Court heard that the 
pair would dress in golf clothing, including baseball caps to hide their
 faces from  cameras, and even chat to other players as they waited for 
their chance.

Police believe
 they struck at least 60 golf clubs – with some being raided twice in 
one day.  When they gained access to changing rooms – on some occasions 
by duping  members of staff – they stole full sets of golf clubs, shoes 
and clothing.

They usually had time to cherry-pick the most expensive clubs.

They
 were featured on the BBC’s Crimewatch in 2010, but were only caught 
during an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) into a 
corrupt criminal defence lawyer with whom Lloyd was friends.

Caught on CCTV: The pair stole more than £750,000 of gear from at least 60 golf clubs around the country, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Above, Lloyd (left) and McCaughey (right) outside Dainton Park Golf Club

Raid: They targeted up to 1,000 lockers - stealing expensive golf clubs, shoes and clothing, before later selling the equipment to foreign buyers. Above, Lloyd struggles to carry the stolen items outside the facility in Devon

When
 police searched Lloyd’s computer, they found numerous searches for the 
burgled clubs as well as articles about picking locks and ‘golf club 
locker security’.

Steve 
Baldwin, NCA head of regional investigations, said: ‘These men were 
professional burglars who tried to mask their identities by avoiding 
CCTV cameras, changing their clothes to enter the  same clubs over and 
over again, and using false number plates on their vehicles.

‘We
 proved they had stolen equipment from hundreds of golfers, which they 
disposed of here and overseas. Our focus is now the financial side of 
the investigation and stripping them of their assets.’

Entering: The court heard the pair were responsible for at least 36 separate burglaries in 2009 - four of which were carried out in Lancashire  in one day. Above, Lloyd prepares to enter Taunton Golf Club in Somerset

Disguised: Lloyd sports a blue jumper, white polo shirt and black cap as he enters the club's changing rooms

Exit: He can later be seen leaving the club, while carrying an expensive piece of golfing equipment in his hand

A
 spokesman added: ‘Officers believe Lloyd funded his lifestyle by 
committing crime as there are no tax records to support his claim that 
he was a businessman involved in property and car deals.

‘In
 addition to his luxury house, which is worth over £800,000, he drove 
high-value vehicles including a Bentley and a Range Rover.’

CCTV
 from one raid – at Dainton Park Golf Club in south Devon – showed the 
pair leave and re-enter the clubhouse several times, on each occasion 
carrying out golf clubs worth thousands of pounds.

Another raid: CCTV footage shows the pair repeatedly raiding Dainton Park Golf Club. Above, Lloyd at the club

Picking the lock: During the raids, the duo also used false number plates on their cars to hide their identities, the court heard. Above, Lloyd breaks into a locker on a different day, while sporting yet another disguise

Stash: The pair featured on BBC's Crimewatch in 2010, but were only caught during an investigation by the National Crime Agency into a corrupt criminal defence lawyer with whom Lloyd (pictured) was friends

Loaded up: The burglar carries a load of gear in his bags and hands as he prepares to leave the Devon club

The
 pair were found guilty of conspiracy to burgle following a three-week 
trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Lloyd, of Bromley, south-east London, 
was jailed for five years and McCaughey, of Croydon, for three years.

Although
 evidence relating to 36 burglaries was used during the trial, officers 
believe Lloyd and McCaughey could have raided up to 1,000 lockers in 60 
clubs between 2008 and 2009 and stolen equipment worth more than 
£750,000.

Stealing spree: The criminals also targeted clubs in Nottinghamshire, North Yorkshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Wiltshire, South Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. Above, Lloyd is pictured in the car park of one of the clubs

Caught again: Lloyd appears to examine the security of a golf club, while dressed in a blue tracksuit and cap

Conviction: Lloyd and McCaughey were convicted of conspiracy to burgle at Birmingham Crown Court (above)
