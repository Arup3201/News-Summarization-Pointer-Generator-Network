On the mend: Doctors say former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is recovering from a 'minimally invasive' surgery to remove a growth from her bladder

According to reports last night, she left hospital on Friday and is now understood to be ‘convalescing privately’.

It is not clear whether she is now at home.

Shortly after she was admitted to hospital, Lord Bell, a friend and former adviser, said the former PM had undergone ‘minimally invasive’ surgery.

He added: ‘She’s very tough. The doctors are perfectly happy. They say the operation has been completely satisfactory.’

Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted a message to Lady Thatcher after her admission, saying that he wished her a ‘speedy recovery’.
