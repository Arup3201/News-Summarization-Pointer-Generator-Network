Despite some deputies being knocked over in the melee, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich's ruling party still managed to install one of its parliamentary deputies as speaker.

The
 violent scenes were similar to yesterday when the new session of the 
Ukrainian parliament got off to a dramatic start with MPs brawling on the floor of the chamber while a topless protest against corruption was staged outside.

Members of feminist group Femen, 
whose motto is 'We came, we undressed, we conquered', stripped naked down to just black pants and knee-high black socks in temperatures of minus 3C.

Their stunt was an attempt to draw 
attention to the plight of opposition leader and ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko who was jailed for 
crimes not recognised in the West as punishable by prison.

Before being hauled away by police, the Femen protesters claimed parliament, which yesterday met for the first time since the 'flawed' October elections in the country, was a 'stable' for the 'horses of oligarchs'.

Inside
 parliament, the opposition nationalist Svoboda group chased and 
manhandled two MPs, a father and son, in a bid to prevent them taking 
the oath.

Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is the leader of the main opposition party, All-Ukrainian Union, also known as 'Fatherland'.

She lost the Ukrainian presidential election to Viktor Yanukovych in 2010 and has since faced a number of criminal charges.

Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after being found guilty of abuse of office when brokering a gas deal with Russia in 2009.

The European Union and other international organisations have ruled the conviction as 'justice being applied selectively under political motivation'.

Tymoshenko is currently being held in 
Kharkiv, where she is receiving treatment at a hospital 
after being diagnosed with a spinal disc herniation.

She is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights against her conviction.

The Ukraine government commissioned a team of U.S. lawyers to compile a dossier on the case to use in its defence at the appeal.

But the Daily Telegraph reports the dossier states the trial was 'flawed' and would not have met the requirements of a Western court.

Gregory Craig, former White House counsel for President Barack Obama and the dossier lead author, said: 'We concluded that there were ways in which Tymoshenko was not given a fair trial.'

A legal expert told the newspaper the procedural violations would have led 'to a cancellations of the verdict' in the West.

They were physically ejected from the chamber by opposition 
deputies who accused them of defecting to the ruling coalition.

The procedural wrangling at the opening of the 
new parliament threatened to push back a key vote on whether Mykola Azarov will be endorsed for a new term as prime minister.

The vote will be the
 first test of the support for President Viktor Yanukovich, who 
re-nominated Azarov.

But when the speaker formally announced that 
Azarov and his government were present, the chamber echoed to opposition
 cries of 'Hanba! Hanba!' (Shame!)

MPs
 from Tymoshenko's party wore black jerseys with her portrait on the 
front and the phrase 'Freedom to Political Prisoners' on the back.

Tymoshenko remains in prison after being sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 for alleged abuse of office over a gas deal with Russia.

Yanukovich's pro-business Party of the 
Regions and their allies enjoyed a strong majority in the last 
parliament, which allowed them to push through changes to the electoral 
law and a law on use of the Russian language that sparked street 
protests.

Despite losing seats in the October elections, the results were seen as a consolidation of President Yanukovych's power as his party still remained the biggest in parliament. 

Most analysts said they believed horse-trading would ensure enough support from independents and others to secure the required 226 or more seats. But the new opposition line-up, whose leaders have ruled out any coalition with the Regions, quickly showed their teeth.

Deputies from the three main opposition parties surrounded the speaker's rostrum, effectively blocking activation of the electronic system which would allow deputies to vote on Azarov's nomination and the appointment of parliamentary officials.

After a prolonged stand-off, both sides went home agreeing to resume business on Thursday, according to the Regions Party.

Separately, the government put off a meeting scheduled for Thursday morning.
