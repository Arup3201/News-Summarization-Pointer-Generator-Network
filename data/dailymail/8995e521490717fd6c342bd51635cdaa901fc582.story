It's easy to forget Jodie Williams is only 20. She has already experienced a stellar junior career in which she put together a five-year, 151-race unbeaten run, and suffered injury heartbreak when a torn hamstring ended her dreams of competing at London 2012.

Now, at such a tender age, Williams has already won her first senior medal, a silver in the 200 metres at the Commonwealth Games. This girl doesn’t hang about. Williams has ‘pain is temporary’ and ‘victory is forever’ tattooed on her wrists, a reminder of the months she has spent trying to get back to her best.

The British 200m champion has finally accepted National Lottery funding, albeit in the second tier ‘Podium Potential’ category, and started working under a new coach, Christine Bowmaker.

So good to be back: Jodie Williams got her reward after two tough years in the form of a silver medal

‘I had doubts I would make it back,’ said Williams. ‘I was pretty much out for two years. I have had a hard time getting back and my confidence was massively knocked, so to come back here and get a medal in this kind of field is a massive confidence boost. I am just hoping I can continue this.’

Williams’ successful junior career, articulate manner and good looks earned her the nickname ‘Moneylegs’, but it was the sprinter’s calm intelligence that was worth its weight in gold on Thursday night.

She passed two Jamaican athletes when she came off the bend and equalled the second-fastest time ever recorded by a British woman, 22.50sec, despite cold, damp conditions.

Williams has achieved so much for one so young, but that proves there is surely still more to come.
