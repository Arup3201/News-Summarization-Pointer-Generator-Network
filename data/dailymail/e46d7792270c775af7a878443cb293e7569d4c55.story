Enduring an uncomfortable flight can often make or break a holiday.

But for some travellers, an unpleasant journey can often start long before the plane takes off.

Travel website sleepinginairports.net has unveiled its annual list of the world's worst airports, with one being likened to 'a prison' and another being labelled a 'human sauna'.

The 2014 Guide to Sleeping at Airports named Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport as world's worst

And there are some surprising entries in the top 10 list, from New York's LaGuardia to Paris Beauvais-Tille airport.

Paris' Beauvais-Tille International Airport was voted in sixth place, and described as 'cramped, rundown, debatably clean, and not particularly friendly, this airport does little more than load and unload passengers in a cargo-like fashion'. 

Once likened to a 'third world country' by US Vice-President Joe Biden, LaGuardia International Airport was voted into 10th place.

Travellers repeatedly take issue with the long security lines, drab décor, poor restaurant selection, lackluster cleanliness and notoriously unhelpful staff.

The 2014 Guide to Sleeping at Airports named Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport the very worst after tourists were asked to rate their airport experiences based on comfort, facilities, cleanliness and customer service.

Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport came in at fourth place after three consecutive years on the top spot, mainly because of overcrowding and air conditioning problems.

No UK airports appeared in the global top 10, but Luton did make an appearance on the list of worst European airports, coming in eighth place.

Saudi Arabia's Jeddah King Abdulaziz International Airport came second on the list, with travellers blaming the lack of services, rude immigration officers, lengthy queues and uncomfortable metal chairs

The survey asked travellers to rate their overall airport experiences between September 2013 and August 2014.

One customer likened Pakistan's Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International Airport to 'a central prison' adding: 'Many of the touts and taxi drivers loot people at the airport and outside'.

Tourists also criticised the absence of crowd control, 'pervasive corruption', inconsistent security checks and the overall lack of cleanliness and technology.

Saudi Arabia's Jeddah King Abdulaziz International Airport came second on the list, with travellers blaming the lack of services, rude immigration officers, lengthy queues and uncomfortable metal chairs.

Nepal's Kathmandu Tribhuvan International Airport was voted third in the annual survey, and was described as 'a bus station in an impoverished neighbourhood'

Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport came in at fourth place after three consecutive years on the top spot, mainly because of overcrowding and air conditioning problems

Uzbekistan's Tashkent International Airport was fifth on the list, with poor crowd control the main grievance

Nepal's Kathmandu Tribhuvan International Airport was voted third in the annual survey, and was described as 'a bus station in an impoverished neighbourhood'. 

The lack of cleanliness was a again particular concern, as was the lack of soap, air-conditioning and filthy smoking room.

After three years at the top of the worst airport lists, Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport saw a slight improvement after coming fourth on the list following refurbishment works.

However, customers still took exception to overcrowding, lengthy queues, limited seating, unfriendly immigration officers and smelly toilets, with travellers complaining that Terminal 1 had become Asia's 'largest public sauna' when the air­conditioning broke down in April.

Paris' Beauvais-Tille International Airport was voted in sixth place, and described as 'cramped, rundown, debatably clean, and not particularly friendly

In seventh place was Frankfurt's Hahn International Airport. Comfort levels were criticised and the atmosphere was labelled 'bleak, bare-boned and not especially welcoming'

Italy's Bergamo Orio al Serio International Airport was given a withering verdict after coming in eighth place, with one travellers writing: 'The only way this airport could be improved would be to destroy it and rebuild'

Uzbekistan's Tashkent International Airport was fifth on the list, with poor crowd control the main grievance.

One traveller remarked: 'The person behind you will be trying to cut in front by subtly ramming their baggage cart into the back of your legs. Hold your ground!' 

Another added: 'Elbows are required should you hope to maintain your spot in line, since any form of line-up or crowd control seems to be virtually non-existent.' 

Berlin's Tegel International Airport was criticised for limited seating, long queues, crowded restaurants and 'little personal space'

USA Vice-President Joe Biden likened New York City's LaGuardia airport to a 'third world country'

In seventh place was Frankfurt's Hahn International Airport.

The review added: 'The real downer occurs upon realising that the airport charges for virtually everything – beginning with wi-fi and ending with the plastic liquid bags for security.'

In contrast, Singapore's Changi International Airport was voted the world's best airport for the 18th year in a row, with travellers praising the 'world-class' shopping, spas, swimming pool, gym, lounges, 4-story slide, movie theatres, TV lounges, free Singapore city tour and the 800 mobile charging points.
