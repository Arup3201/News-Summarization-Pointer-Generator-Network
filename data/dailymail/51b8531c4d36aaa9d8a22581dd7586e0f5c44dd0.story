A Chelsea fan on Twitter - @TalkoftheBridge – tweeted recently: 'I dread the day John Terry retires more than I dread my own death.' At first it makes shocking reading, but when you factor in the extreme passion of football fans, the love they have for their club, and the astonishingly high regard Chelsea fans have for their captain, it all makes sense. It should be interpreted in the same way as Bill Shankly’s famous quote: 'Football is not a matter of life and death, it’s more important that that.'

Here’s another way of saying it. Chelsea will not be able to replace Terry when he finally retires. England have had to move on already. But the question remains, how on earth will Chelsea cope when the inevitable happens?

Life and Chelsea Football Club will go on of course, but reflecting on yet another incredible man-of-the-match performance from Terry at Wembley, it occurred to me that he is unique.

Not so long ago some were declaring Terry was finished. He couldn’t train properly, we were told. He couldn’t play two games in a week apparently.

The truth is very different.

Andre Villas-Boas' ridiculous high line ensured this over-hyped manager got the worst from Terry and made the player look vulnerable. And then Rafa Benitez arrived to seemingly finish off the destruction of arguably Chelsea’s greatest ever player.

Jose Mourinho has resurrected the King of Stamford Bridge.

It is now a major cause for concern among Chelsea fans if Terry isn’t in the starting line-up. So in playing terms, he is still the first name on the team sheet, even with the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa, Nemanja Matic and Eden Hazard at the club.

But the love for Terry among Chelsea fans is about so much more than him being a very good centre half. And that’s why he is seemingly irreplaceable.

He came through the youth ranks, and is now a revered Chelsea captain. His team-mates respect him, and they listen to him. The fans still idolise him. The football world laughed when he lifted the Champions League trophy with his full kit on despite being suspended for that final. But most if not all Chelsea fans understood it. Terry was a huge part of that journey, and in their minds he belonged on that podium, he deserved the champagne, and he deserved to be wearing the shirt that night as the celebrations began.

The cynics and critics will go on and on about Terry’s indiscretions – some alleged, some not. He’s far from perfect of course, a bit like the rest of us. And I wouldn’t say Chelsea fans don’t care about any of that stuff. But it doesn’t hide the fact that when he does decide to retire, there will be a massive Grand Canyon to fill.

I’m not a Chelsea fan, so I asked three friends of mine who are to sum it up. A work colleague, Emma, said this: 'He is our rock, our leader, without him we don’t win all those titles and we love him for how much he gives his all to the shirt. You can imagine cutting him and his blood would spill out blue. Every other fan hates him but knows deep down they would love him in their team.'

Another friend, Laura used the cliche – 'Mr Chelsea' to describe him, and then went on: 'You can see what the team and the club mean to him. His reactions after every game, he always comes over to the Matthew Harding Lower and gets the rest of the team over as well to applaud the fans. A few games ago he signed my shirt, got on the team coach, then got off again and offered a family tickets as he thought he’d heard them say they had travelled but couldn’t get in to the game. It’s a side of him that shows what the fans mean to him and a side that not enough people and media see.'

Another colleague, the ex-Chelsea defender Jason Cundy, told me this: 'John is the best ever CFC youth product, best ever CFC centre back, and most successful captain ever. He’s still so important to the club on and off the field – captain, leader, legend. With so many foreign players at CFC, and so few homegrown players to come through over the last 15 years, he represents the fans on the pitch and plays with the same passion, pride and love for CFC that we fans have in the stands for the club. It will be impossible to replace him.'

Enough said.
