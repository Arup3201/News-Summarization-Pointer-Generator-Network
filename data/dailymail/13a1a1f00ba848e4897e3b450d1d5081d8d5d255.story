With a birthmark in the shape of a love-heart on his back, this adorable 11-week-old Chihuahua is set to be a heartbreaker this Valentine's Day.

Teddy has huge eyes, tiny paws and oversized ears, but when owner Jane Stanley, 53, spotted a giant heart in his markings she knew she had to bring him home.

'He's definitely going to be a bit of a romantic,' said the mother-of-two from Tamworth, Staffordshire.

'Once I saw him and the little heart on his back, I knew we had to bring him home.'

The 11-week-old Chihuahua joins her retired police officer husband Geoff, 60, their other teacup Chihuahua Jenson, Cooper the pug and Basil a Spinone Italiano.

'We say he wears his heart on his back, not his sleeve - he's certainly unique,' said Mr Stanley.

Two Siamese cats and six chickens are also part of the family and Teddy has proved himself to be quite the charmer - in keeping with his unusual birthmark.

'I fell in love with him straight away,' said Mrs Stanley.

'He was the only one of the puppies with unusual markings and we thought he was perfect.

'We can't believe how fitting his character is - he loves kisses and cuddles and he cries if you move away from him.

'He snuggles in with the other dogs and sometimes joins the cats in their basket.

'He's so cuddly that he even sleeps in our bed - he's the only dog that does.'

Teddy was a gift for the foster carer following the death of her beloved pomeranian.

When she spotted his picture on the internet she went to visit the owner of his mother to pick one of seven puppies.

But on arrival she saw the heart marking in his fur and knew he was the pet for them.
