Smaller broadband providers have beaten bigger rivals in an annual customer satisfaction survey. 

While BT, Sky and TalkTalk all scored less than 50 per cent in the Which? poll, John Lewis Broadband, Zen Internet, Utility Warehouse and Plusnet achieved more than 70 per cent.

John Lewis came top with 76 per cent while BT was bottom with 45 per cent, just below Sky and TalkTalk, both on 48.

However, most of the 11 providers in the poll received only three stars for speed, with TalkTalk getting two and only Virgin Media and Zen Internet scoring four.

Which? surveyed 1,757 broadband users in December and January. The consumer group wants advertising watchdogs to tighten rules to ensure advertised broadband speeds more closely match most customers' experience. 

Currently providers can advertise speeds that only 10 per cent of customers actually receive.

Campaigners are calling for advertising speed claims such as 'superfast' to be quantified by providers, customers to be given written speed estimates at the start of the contract with an accurate estimate for their individual address and users to be allowed to exit contracts without penalty if they do not get the minimum speed estimated at any point in their contract.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Smaller suppliers are leaving larger rivals in their wake when it comes to the service they provide so we need to see the big players up their game.

'Ofcom is also currently reviewing this market and we now need it to identify how it plans to ensure broadband customers get a better deal.

'We've told the advertising watchdogs that companies need to be much clearer with their customers about the speeds they can expect. However, three months on, we're still waiting for them to announce how they'll ensure adverts only show the speeds most customers actually receive.'
