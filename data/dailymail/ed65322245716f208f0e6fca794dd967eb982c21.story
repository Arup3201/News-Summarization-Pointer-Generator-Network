Disabled Levi Mayhew from Indiana was given an opportunity of a lifetime to go on a Make-A-Wish Foundation trip to Disney World with his family.

However, as the six-year-old is terminally ill and battles a rare congenital disorder that makes him unable to travel, he and his family kindly sent his friend instead.

And when Emma Broyer, ten, from Martinsville, who has helped support Levi during his medical struggles, got word she was going on the trip, she made sure to keep him a part of every moment... by taking along a cardboard cutout of him.

Levi Mayhew, 6, from Indiana was given an opportunity of a lifetime to go on a Make-A-Wish Foundation trip to Disney World with his family. However, his terminal illness makes him unable to travel, so he (bottom right pictured with his parents Justin and Rebecca Drake) chose to send his best friend, Emma Broyer (right) instead

When ten-year-old Emma from Martinsville, who has provided tremendous support for Levi during his medical struggles, got word she was going on the trip - she made sure to keep him apart of every moment by creating a cardboard cut-out version of him (left)

Emma created 'Flat Levi', a cardboard laminated, cutout version of him with a photograph of his face. 

Her family took pictures of her alongside it during their travels in December to share with Levi and his family when they returned.

'Flat Levi' was with her from her first airplane and limo rides, going through security at the airport to spending time on the beach. Through her cardboard companion, he was with her in spirit.

Levi was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder on the Zellweger Spectrum two years ago, which has left him unable to talk or walk, according to WTHR.

But he found a supportive and caring friend in Emma at school where she walks him to his classroom, greets him in the hallway and encourages other classmates to send him cards.

When Make-A-Wish Foundation contacted Levi's family about the trip to Disney World in Florida, the family knew they would be unable to make the trip, according to New York Daily News.

So after it was decided to send Emma and her family, and Make-A-Wish gave their blessing, a surprise party was thrown to share the news with her. She was presented with a shirt that read 'Levi wished for me to go to Disney'.

Without a dry eye in the room, Emma, who has never ridden in a limo, on a plane or been to the beach, was overwhelmed by the incredibly kind gesture.

Upon returning from the special trip, the Broyers surprised Levi and his family with a 'Emma and Levi's Trip' scrapbook, according to ABC News.

Levi's mom, Rebecca Drake, said that it felt really good to give back to Emma, reported WTHR.

She said: 'Emma had given so much to us without even realizing it. It's a very warm feeling to know that another child loves and cares so much for your child, especially while facing the challenges stacked against us. 

'It's so innocent and pure. If angels really do walk the earth, Emma is one. She's Levi's angel. This story proves that the "power of one" is astounding.'

Levi's mom said she hopes that people will learn of Levi and Emma's story and will be inspired to help children who have special needs. She said all it takes is a smile to make a difference.
