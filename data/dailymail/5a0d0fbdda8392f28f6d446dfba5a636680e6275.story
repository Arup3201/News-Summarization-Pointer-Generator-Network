Joseph Julian Guerra, 28, was jailed for 60 years after kidnapping a woman and carving his name into her thighs in Texas

A pimp who kidnapped a prostitute and carved his name into her thighs has been jailed for 60 years.

Joseph Julian Guerra was convicted after a two-day trial during which the jury heard horrific details of the injuries suffered by Margaret Dodd.

After having her hands and feet bound with duct tape she was smashed in the face with a metal skillet.

The victim was punched, kicked and kneed in the face breaking her nose and knocking out her teeth.

Guerra, 28, used a knife to carve his nickname 'Ace' into her thighs.

The victim told the court that Guerra also tried to strangle her with a wrench and threatened to rape her with a knife, according to Dallas News.

The court in Collin County, Texas, heard the 20-year-old escaped after Guerra fell asleep.

She ran to a neighbor who was so terrified by the sight of the blood-soaked woman that she refused to let her in.

The
 neighbor called 911 and the woman was found battered and bleeding by 
police sitting on a curb outside a house in Allen, Texas in July 2012.

The court heard Guerra told the woman he carved his name into her so that she would 'always remember him'.

After finding the woman, police entered Guerra's home and found him sleeping soundly next to his one-year-old daughter.

Prosecutors told jurors that Guerra took advantage of Dodd and became her pimp.

After she lost $700 she owed him, Guerra set out to teach her a lesson, prosecutors said.

Prior to sentencing Dodd ran out an impact statement saying: 'Since the day I met you, you had complete control over everything. Thatâ€™s done now.'

Dodd told Guerra she forgave him prompting Guerra to apologize.

'I'm sorry,' he said.

District Judge Scott Becker ordered Guerra to stop talking and when he said sorry again and said that he loved her was removed from the courtroom.

The sentences for the aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charges are identical and will be served at the same time.

Guerra can be considered for parole after serving at least 30 years of his 60-year sentence.
