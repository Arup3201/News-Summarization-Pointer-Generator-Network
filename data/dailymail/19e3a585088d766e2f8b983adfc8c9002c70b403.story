Arrest: Ketut Pujayasa has been charged with attempted murder and sexual abuse

A Holland America cruise ship worker has beenÂ  arrested in Florida after admitting that he raped and beat an American passenger during a nude cruise, before trying to throw her overboard.

Ketut Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the Nieuw Amsterdam, claimed he attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted him when he tried to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day.

The 28-year-old, from Indonesia, told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed.

The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape.

Pujayasa allegedly told police he decided to attack the woman, who has not been named, after she told him: 'Wait a minute, son of a b****' when he knocked on her door with her breakfast.

'Pujayasa stated that the passenger's 
comment of "son of a bitch" was offensive to himself and his parents. He
 was angry and upset the rest of the day,' FBI Special Agent David Nunez
 wrote in a report seen by the Sun Sentinel.

The steward had considered hitting the woman when he spotted her on a deck later in the day, but decided it was too crowded, he told police.

He allegedly used a master key to get in the passenger's room, and waited on the balcony for the woman to return to her room that night, then hit her with a laptop and tried to choke her with the cord from curling tongs and a phone wire.

His victim fought back, biting him, striking at his exposed genitals and using a corkscrew to try to stab him, Pujayasa reportedly told the FBI.

He claimed that he wanted to throw the woman into the sea, while the ship was passing by Roatan, Honduras.

After her attacker was scared off, the victim fled to a hallway where a fellow passenger found her covered in blood and wearing only a tank top.

'The passenger also noted that [the 
victim] had a curling iron wrapped and tangled around her neck and/or 
hair. He also described [her] as having black eyes and visible bruising 
around her neck and shoulders.

'[The woman], fearing death was imminent, 
asked the passenger to relay to her family how much she loved them,' the FBI report stated.

The cruise ship docked in Honduras and the victim was airlifted to a Florida hospital. Security guards on the ship detained Pujayasa until they arrived in the Everglades on Sunday.

The victim had been on an eight-day 
cruise with nudist vacation specialists Bare Necessities, which took in 
Jamaica, the Bahamas and Honduras on a voyage that left Florida on 
February 9.

As well as traveling to exotic 
destinations, guests were able to take part in couples massage, Tantra 
classes, a production of the Vagina Monologues and a Captain's party, according to the travel company's website.

Guests on the cruises, which had been run previously on the Nieuw Amsterdam, are required to wear clothes only when the ship is in port, or when they are at dinner or attending the Captain's party.

In a statement to Mail Online, Nancy Tiemann, the co-owner of Bare Necessities, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the incident that occurred on one of our cruise ship charters last week and are encouraged by reports that our passenger is recovering from her injuries.'

'Our hearts go out to our passenger and we stand ready to aid her in any way possible. It would be a disservice to our cruise guest to comment on what is a most difficult and disturbing incident,' she added.

Pujayasa has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated sexual abuse. Holland America has fired the employee, who had worked for the company since 2012.

The cruise company told the Daily News he had been subject to a careful screening, had no criminal record and had no performance issues before the alleged attack.

'We continue to work closely with 
authorities to understand how this incident occurred and what additional
 actions we can take to help ensure that nothing like this ever happens 
again,' a statement from the company said.
