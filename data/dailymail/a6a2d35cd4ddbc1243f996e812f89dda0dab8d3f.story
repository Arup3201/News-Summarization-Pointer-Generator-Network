Ibrox legend Barry Ferguson wants Dave King to be the new power behind Rangers.

Speaking after King arrived in Glasgow this week for talks with directors and insisted he was confident of brokering a £16million funding package for the Championship outfit, Ferguson threw his weight behind the Castlemilk-born tycoon.

The former Scotland and Rangers skipper would like the South African businessman to eventually gain control of the club - but is refusing to raise his hopes after seeing too many false dawns in Govan.

‘It’s good to see somebody like Dave King, who’s been at the club and knows what it’s all about, in talks,’ said Ferguson.

‘Ideally, somebody like him would come in but, until it’s actually signed and sealed, we just don’t know.

‘Until I see it in black and white and it’s done, then you can talk about it. Things have happened in the past and nothing has come of it. We don’t know how this will go.

‘That’s the biggest frustration for Rangers fans - my mates and people I meet on the street. One minute you think things are going well. The next minute it all falls flat on its face.

‘I don’t think any Rangers fans will be getting too excited right now. I’m the same as the vast majority. Until we see something happening, we can’t get excited because we have hit brick walls before.’

With the club in danger of running out of cash before the end of the year, King is trying to convince the board to accept his £16m bailout deal.

Allied with former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham, he spoke with directors on Tuesday about his rescue package in which he would assume a 51 per cent stake in the club through a new share issue.

But the situation has been complicated by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley’s ongoing move to oust chief executive Graham Wallace and Philip Nash as directors, who are both favourable to King’s plan.

King was a director of Rangers for 11 years after investing £20m in 2000 and although Ferguson doesn’t claim to be close to him, he feels he is the right option for Rangers.

‘Mike Ashley has done a hell of a job at Newcastle but if you ask the vast majority of the Rangers fans they would want a Rangers supporter to take over and that would be Dave King,’ he said.

‘We visited his house in Johannesburg with Rangers once. He had a lot of memorabilia but I remember the size of his wine cellar more than anything. It was massive!

‘I spoke to Dave a few times. We never ever sat down and discussed things as he kept himself to himself.

‘But what I do know is he’s a Rangers fan and that’s what you want.

‘It’s a hard one because about a year ago, it looked as though Dave was coming back. Then it went quiet.

‘I said then that we needed someone like him to come in, take control and put the club back on the map.

‘Everyone is sick of it - from the fans to the players, management and staff at the club, they just want it sorted.’
