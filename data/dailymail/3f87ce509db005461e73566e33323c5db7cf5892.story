The ex-wife of Soham killer Ian Huntley has told of how she could tell her husband was responsible from the moment she heard him speak on television about the two girls' deaths.

The school caretaker was interviewed on TV shortly after Holly Wells and Jessica ­Chapman went missing, as the world watched in ignorance of his guilt.

But Claire Evans, who had suffered sickening abuse at Huntley's hands herself, said she knew immediately that he was involved.

'I couldn't move and I felt totally paralysed when I saw him on TV.

'I just knew it - I had a gut 
instinct.I could tell from the way he was talking and his body language 
that he had done something. That he was responsible for killing the 
girls.'

Ms Evans, who was married to Huntley for four years, told the Sunday Mirror that ten years on, she is still wracked with guilt over the deaths of the two 10-year-olds.

Despite her suspicions after his interview, which took place because the girls were thought to have passed his home, she kept quiet.

'His evilness all came flooding back,' she said. 'He seemed so cocky, and it was scary. I felt weak again, like when he would abuse me when we were married.'

When he was later arrested and charged, she was filled with horror, believing she could have saved their lives by speaking out.

It soon emerged that there was nothing she could have done because he had killed them straight away - but she admitted she still regrets staying quiet.

She also believes that if Huntley had ­succeeded in his attempt to strangle her when they were together several years earlier, the schoolgirls would be alive today.

She revealed for the first time: 'If Ian had killed me when he had his hands around my 
throat, I sometimes feel none of this would have happened

Killer: Huntley is serving two life sentences with a minimum of 40 years for the murders.

'He would have been done for my murder and would never have been free to ruin the lives of those two defenceless little girls.'

Ms Evans, 36,
endured years of ­physical and mental abuse at the hands of their 
killer, now 38.

He sexually assaulted her, ­attacked her in the shower and 
hacked off her hair so that no other man would find her ­attractive.

She was even forced to abort their baby after Huntley ­threatened: 'Have that child and I’ll do things to it.'

Ms Evans, who has since married for a third time and is now a mum of two, also told how ­17 years ago Huntley came within seconds of killing her as he tried to crush her windpipe.

She only survived because she managed to grab hold of a metal hob cover and hit him over the head with it.

Ms Evans says she knows now her former husband would have killed her. Huntley is serving two life ­sentences in Frankland prison.

The pair met in 1994, eight years before the murders of Holly and Jessica, while they were both working in a food factory in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Huntley, then 20, was a cleaner while Ms Evans, who was 18, worked as a ­production operator.

They kissed at the factory's Christmas party and a whirlwind romance followed. Within days Ms Evans had moved into Huntley’s one-bedroom flat and a month later he had proposed.

The pair got married in January 1995, and soon after the relationship soon became abusive and his behaviour increasingly more bizarre and psychotic.

Ms Evans told how she went from a 
healthy size 12 to a minuscule size four because of the stress. But although she 
felt trapped, she believed she had no alternative but to stick with 
Huntley.

Ms Evans also revealed that she was forced to make the heart-breaking decision to have a 
termination to abort his child - because she was so scared about what 
Huntley would do to it.

When Huntley eventually found out about the termination, he beat her up.

He finally granted Ms Evans a divorce in
1999. She married his brother Wayne in July 2000, but that relationship ended four 
years later.

By 2002 Huntley
had got ­together with Maxine Carr, 35, and the pair moved to ­Soham, 
Cambridgeshire, where he got a job as a school
caretaker and was living in a house in the grounds.

On August 4, when Holly and Jessica went out to buy some sweets, they passed Huntley’s house.

He
called them inside, killed them in his bathroom and later disposed of 
their bodies near RAF ­Lakenheath in ­Suffolk.

He was convicted of their
murder the following year, while Carr, who worked as a ­teaching 
assistant at the school, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for 
providing him with a false alibi.
