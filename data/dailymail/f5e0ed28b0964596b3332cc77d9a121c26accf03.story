The high-profile 'super lawyer' believed to have been dating the paralegal found dead in a bathtub full of water in his home has penned a bizarre tribute to the woman on his Facebook page.

The body of Julia Papazian Law, 26, was found yesterday morning, naked and face-down in the bathtub in the Philadelphia home of A. Charles Peruto Jr.

She had been working as Peruto's paralegal for about two years, and she and Peruto had been dating, according to reports.

Today, Peruto posted an odd tribute to the Miss Law on his Facebook page, according to NBC Philadelphia.

He wrote: 'It's very hard to find someone who really matches you on all eight cylinders. I found my soulmate hippy, and can never replace her. We worked and played, and never got enough life.

'I'm grateful we made every minute count, without a single dispute about anything ever. I'm especially sad for her 10-year-old brother, who was her life, along with her loving and close sisters, mother and step-father. Earth lost the best one ever. Happy birthday baby.'

At the time of her death, Miss Law was three days away from her 27th birthday.

Philadelphia's Fox affiliate reports that authorities do not currently consider the death to be suspicious, although, the cause of death currently is unknown.

The woman's body was discovered at about 10:30am by a maintenance worker who stopped by the home, located in Philadelphia's Center City neighborhood.

Speaking to NBC Philadelphia in Spanish, the worker said: 'The first thing I did was call 9-1-1 and police showed up. I then went to homicide to give my accounts of what happened.'

The station also reported that no drugs were found in the home.

Police sources identified the dead 26-year-old as Julia Law, who reportedly was dating 'super lawyer' A Charles Peruto Jr., who owns the home where the body was found

Peruto told police he had been at the Jersey Shore, in Avalon, when the body was found. He was questioned by detectives and has not been arrested.

He would not speak to reporters seeking comment outside of his home.

He has handled numerous high-profile cases in the Philadelphia area, including alleged mobsters and killers.

According to his website, Peruto has been dubbed a 'super lawyer' - an honor for Philadelphia's top attorneys - by his peers nine years in a row, and has achieved 'Not Guilty verdict in over 200 jury trials and 2,500 non-jury trials.'

'He has been hired by other attorneys for the sole purpose of cross examining one or two witnesses in their cases,' the website boasts.

It goes on to say that 'as can be seen on this website under "Past Cases,"Â  he has been called a "ferocious cross examiner," "gives a supreme closing argument to a Jury," and "very entertaining on an otherwise boring case.'"

In 2012, Peruto 'successfully' represented Philadelphia weatherman John Bolaris in a situation the media dubbed ' the real life Hangover.'

Bolaris claimed he was drugged and scammed out of $43,712 by Russian 'bar girls' in Miami. He subsequently lost his job with Philadelphia's Fox affiliate.

Police continue to investigate the circumstances of the death.
