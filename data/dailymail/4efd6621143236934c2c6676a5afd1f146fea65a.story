Inspector Ian Hanson claims police resources were so stretched that officers were not making arrests 'out of necessity'

Police are choosing not to arrest drunks on Friday and Saturday nights because there are as few as four officers on duty in some city centres.

A senior officer in Manchester has claimed that resources are so stretched that officers are not arresting those drunk and disorderly ‘out of necessity’, for fear that there will be no one left to police the streets if they take offenders into custody.

Inspector Ian Hanson, chairman of the Greater Manchester branch of the Police Federation, said as few as four officers were on duty at some times of the night in the city centre and taking a bobby off the beat to process a drunken yob at a police station would ‘reduce the beleaguered thin blue line yet further’.

His comments have been echoed by Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, who said officers across the country faced a dilemma about whether to arrest binge-drinking thugs or risk letting them loose to create further disorder because there simply ‘aren’t enough officers to go around’.

The row comes after Dr Cliff Mann, the leader of Britain’s A&E doctors, said police should adopt a zero-tolerance approach to binge drinking by arresting drunks who ended up in accident and emergency.

However yesterday Inspector Hanson said the plan by the president of the College of Emergency Medicine was ‘poorly thought out and not based in the reality of where our police service now finds itself’.

He added: ‘Every weekend in Greater Manchester Police we battle to keep a presence on the streets.

‘The reality behind the fact that arrests for drink-related offences have reduced is that police officers out of necessity are not making arrests. Quite where these additional detainees will be kept is quite another challenge.’

Yesterday local police and crime commissioner Tony Lloyd said: ‘It’s unrealistic to expect the police, with all the other demands it faces, to police drunkenness in any of our towns and cities.’ 

Recently Lincolnshire police and crime commissioner Alan Hardwick revealed that there are only 18 constables available to deploy in Lincoln on an average Saturday night.

And Mr White said officers up and down the country were having to come up with ‘imaginative alternatives’ to arrest when faced with drunken behaviour at weekends while forces were at their busiest.

He said: ‘I have no doubt this is something that is not particular to city centres such as Manchester, Bristol, the West Midlands or London, it’s happening across the UK.’ 

Dr Cliff Mann said the threat of arrest would deter people from drinking too much and reduce the pressure on medics.Police arrest a reveller on New Year's Eve in Manchester city centre

He said there were not enough officers to cope with the impact of 24-hour drinking laws introduced by Labour in the wake of police funding cuts, adding: ‘On Friday and Saturday nights you get to a crescendo of activity, typically between 1am and 2am where all resources are out.

‘You may be dealing with a complete idiot, who in the normal course of events would be arrested for public disorder. But where you are the only one left and other calls are coming in, you can’t do that.’

Northamptonshire Chief Constable Adrian Lee said: ‘When an arrest is made it can take an officer off the street for the rest of their shift.

‘The use of other powers, such as making people leave town centres who are too heavily intoxicated, ensures that we keep officers where they are most needed.

‘Arresting and prosecuting all of those who are too drunk to take care of themselves would place a huge demand on police and the criminal justice system. We respond proportionately, using the powers we have available to us.’
