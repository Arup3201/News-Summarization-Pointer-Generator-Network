Selfies may have been around for a while - as far back at the 1800s in fact - but one picture broke all social media records in March 2014.

The Oscar selfie featuring Ellen Degeneres, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper, leads the way for social media trends of 2014 as it was retweeted more than two million times.

Ellen shared the snap on her Twitter page where it became the most retweeted ever, with 1,076,971 in less than an hour.

BELFIES

Kim Kardashian spawned what seemed like a never-ending stream of viral imitations and spoofs by showing off her large behind in a white swimsuit last year. And in November she outdid herself by trying to break the internet with her belfie on the cover of Paper magazine.

Kanye West's ex-lover Amber Rose showed just how much she has in common with his new wife as she posted her version of Kim's famous shot in October. 

The 30-year-old showed off her incredible derriere in a tiny dollar bill-themed bathing suit, and the picture has since been liked more than 147,000 times.

While 2014 was also the year TOWIE star Lauren Goodger was threatened with a lawsuit by Carmen Ortega, who claims her belfie was ripped off.

Goodger, 28, reportedly stole the saucy snap from the Instagram of 27-year-old US model and posted it on her own page with the caption: 'Nightmare wife.' Within a few hours of posting it, some followers pointed out that the picture had been taken from Carmen's profile, lightened and had the waist widened. Lauren then deleted the picture.

A few days later Carmen tweeted with two forbidding hashtags - '#lawsuit' and '#TheEnd' - while Lauren wrote that she never made out the picture was of her.

PHOTOBOMBS:

Photobomb, officially defined by the Collins English Dictionary as 'to intrude into the background of a photograph without the subject's knowledge' was announced as the 2014 Word of the Year after seeing off competition from 50,000 other new additions..

While it has been referred to as far back as 2008, the photobomb received a powerful endorsement from Prince Harry and the Queen in July when they were both pictured in the background of athletes' photos at the Commonwealth Games.

Harry did a thumbs up behind New Zealand officials while his grandmother smiled behind Australian hockey players in Glasgow. The image of Her Majesty has been retweeted 15,000 times and favourited by 13,000 Twitter users. 

Actor Benedict Cumberbatch took the craze to the red carpet by jumping up behind U2 at the Oscars in March. The prankster was pictured with arms raised and fingers splayed as the veteran rockers  posed for a photo op on the red carpet ahead of their performance.

ALS ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE:

Everyone from David Beckham to Anna Wintour has now completed the Ice Bucket Challenge for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also referred to as motor neurone disease.

It started in August as a fun way to raise awareness and funds for charities like the ALS Association and MND Association and involves people pouring a freezing cold bucket of water over their heads before nominating other people to get involved. 

The trend began in America and took off when Pete Frates, a former Boston College baseball player tipped to become a Red Sox star who had his career cut short by the disease, nominated fellow Boston athletes to take part.

Quarterback Tom Brady's wife and model Gisele Bundchen also participated in the challenge for a good cause

The makers of The Simpsons joined the good cause by getting Homer to take on the ice bucket challenge before nominating his neighbour Ned Flanders.

Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo showed off his muscles in the video of his challenge, which has been viewed more than three million times on YouTube.

Brit Jack Reynolds became the oldest to take on the ice bucket at 102-years-old, while UK builders also went viral by pouring the water down a rubbish chute.

STEPHEN SUTTON 

Cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton, who tweeted at @_stephensstory, raised £3million for charity in his final months battling the disease.

The 19-year-old, who had been diagnosed with bowel cancer, drew up a bucket list of things he wanted to achieve before he died. At the head of his 46 goals was raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Knowing he did not have long left, he dropped out of school to concentrate on fundraising, and his efforts were so successful that he soon increased his target to £1million.

When in April he was rushed to hospital with breathing problems after one of his lungs collapsed, he believed he had just days to live and urged people to help him reach his target.

After the teenager posted a message online donations started to flood in and he had soon passed £1million. He was also sent messages of support by celebrities from Piers Morgan to Sir Chris Hoy and Russell Brand.

Celebrities, politicians and classmates joined his family in an outpouring of grief after the youngster lost his fight for life. Thousands flocked to donate in his memory as news of his loss spread via social media, causing the page to temporarily crash.

His mother Jane told of her heartbreak at the death of the 'courageous, selfless and inspirational' teen who in the end raised more than £3million for charity. 

NEK NOMINATE:

NekNominate was an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or 'neck' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours.

Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game after he uploaded footage of himself 'necking' beer to Facebook and told his friends to do the same.

He posted: 'I nominate all of you whose birthday it's not. Merry Christmas'.

In some instances, teens are seen downing 'dirty pints' - or concoctions of alcohol and other substances - or large amounts of strong spirits as part of the dare. 

Rebbeca Dagley, 19, infamously stripped in Asda before downing a can of lager in February. 

The video posted on the internet sees her walking into the supermarket in Fosse Park, Leicester, in a beige trench coat and walking around the store before coming to a stop in the fruit and vegetable aisle.

She then takes a can of Stella Artois from her pocket, removes her coat, stripping down to just her bra, knickers and suspenders and downs the can of beer in front of shocked shoppers.

The act was captured on film by a giggling friend - who at the end of the footage nominates three more friends to take part.

Meanwhile Steph-Lou Jones chose a Baywatch swimming costume, McDonald's and a pint of beer for her challenge.

But Throfinn Stout, who downed a pint while flying a small aircraft, and Squaddie James Steel, who drank a goldfish, attracted criticism for their attempts at the controversial drinking challenge.
