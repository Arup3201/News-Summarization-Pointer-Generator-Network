Crystal Palace have been fined by the Premier League for their part in the ‘spygate’ saga involving Cardiff City last season.

The top-flight authorities found that Palace had breached their ‘good faith’ rule - B16 - by obtaining information about Cardiff’s team ahead of their 3-0 win in Wales on April 5.

Cardiff complained in a five-page letter to the Premier League that their former head of recruitment, Iain Moody, now the director of football at Palace, had contacted Cardiff employees for information.

Cardiff: Marshall; Theophile, Caulker, Turner, Taylor; Zaha , Mutch, Medel, Daehli; Campbell, Jones.

The size of the fine is unknown, although the maximum for the breach is £25,000.

The then-Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis strongly denied the accusations at the time, saying: ‘You look at it, for three weeks we have picked the same formation and same team, we haven’t changed anything.

‘Irrespective of who or where it has come from it is pure speculation until the team-sheet comes in. Although I try to avoid it myself, I have known managers change the team 10 minutes before the team sheets have gone in so it is very difficult to say it is definitely going to be that team.’

Sportsmail revealed the complaint in April, with the club requesting an investigation into Palace’s conduct. They later denied that they requested the result of the match be overturned. 

Boss: Tony Pulis, who was managing Palace at the time, refuted the claims

A prominent Cardiff source claimed to Sportsmail at the time that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had only learned of Moody’s alleged efforts when a message sent from Moody's phone was received by Bolton manager Dougie Freedman in error. 

The message, which contained the starting 11 that Solskjaer ultimately fielded against Palace, was forwarded on to Solskjaer, who opted against changing his team.

He is believed to have confronted Pulis ahead of the fixture.

Cardiff’s complaint included a text from Moody naming midfielder Aron Gunnarsson as the source of the information.

Cardiff claimed it read: ‘Straight from Gunnarsson their line up is 4-4-2 Marshall, KTC, Caulker, Turner, Taylor, Daehli, Medel, Mutch, Zaha, Campbell, Jones.’

Gunnarsson denied any involvement and Solskjaer publicly supported the player.
