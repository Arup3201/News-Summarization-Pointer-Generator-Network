Daley Blind and Louis van Gaal were busy shaking hands and posing for pictures on Monday afternoon as Manchester United captured their man. 

But no sooner had the promotional shots been snapped and forms ratified, the pair were straight back to Holland to collect a couple of awards. 

Blind, who has cost United £14million from Ajax, picked up the Golden Shoe at the Dutch Player of the Year awards.

He was followed on stage by his new manager - at club level, anyway - who was presented with a lifetime achievement award for his services to the game. 

Van Gaal looked in circumspect mood as he addressed the audience at the gala in Hilversum after a tricky start to his tenure in Manchester. 

United have failed to win under the new boss yet and were unceremoniously dumped out of the Capital One Cup by League One MK Dons. 

What followed that defeat was a recruitment drive that was going right down to the wire on deadline day as the club tried to get a loan deal for Monaco's Radamel Falcao over the line.
