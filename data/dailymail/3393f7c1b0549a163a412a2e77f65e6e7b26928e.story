It could become the most expensive Apple product in history.

An incredible rare Apple 1 computer, one of only six still working, and the only one with all of its original accessories, is set to be auctioned in Germany.

One was sold for a record $374,500 in June 2012 in New York, and a second 
one of the six is being offered now by auction firm Breker in Germany on
24 November 2012.

According to founder Uwe Breker, this is the first fully working 
Apple I offered publicly in Europe, and the only example with the 
original period peripherals - transformer, Sony monitor and Datanetics 
ASCII keyboard - to have appeared so far.

He said 'There is a long-established market for antique 
'Scientific Instruments', whereas technology from the dawn of the 
computer age is attracting a great new generation of collectors.'

The machine was the first made by Apple.

Steve Jobs was introduced to Steve Wozniak in 1969 and 'Woz' and Jobs became friends while working for Hewlett-Packard in 1970.

By 1976, Wozniak was refining his own computer design.

The Altair 8800 had just made the cover of Popular Electronics and Jobs quickly realised the potential of his friend's invention, as the two college dropouts from California who founded the world's highest-valued company.

Apple Inc. was established in April 
1976 and the first order of 50 computers was assembled in the Jobs' 
family garage and delivered to the Byte Shop for 500 per unit.

Apple I was the first ready-made personal computer.

Apple's machine was the predecessor of all modern computers - even though buyers had to supply their own case

Admittedly, the buyer still had to provide the keyboard and monitor, but as Wozniak explained to enthusiasts at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976, his design allowed the user to work on a 'human-typable keyboard instead of a stupid, cryptic front panel with a bunch of lights and switches'.

Of the 200 Apple I computers ever produced, just 43 have survived, and of these only six are in working order, according to an online registry of the machines.
