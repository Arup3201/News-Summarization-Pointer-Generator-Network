From Hurricane Fly's fourth consecutive Irish Champion Hurdle victory to The New One brushing aside the opposition in Cheltenham’s International Hurdle, it has been an exciting year of racing.

As 2014 nears its conclusion racing correspondent Marcus Townend reviews the past 12 months of racing, and picks his best race of each month. 

JANUARY

Paul Nicholls says main jockey Daryl Jacob is not keen to partner returning stable star Big Buck’s so the mount goes to Sam Twiston-Davies. It is the opening move in an almost inevitable sequence which ends up with Twiston-Davies appointed stable jockey. A £2million coup is landed with four horses all with links to legendary gambler Barney Curley.

RACE OF THE MONTH: Hurricane Fly claims a fourth consecutive Irish Champion Hurdle, emulating the great Istabraq.

FEBRUARY

Days after winning the Irish Hennessy Gold Cup with Last Instalment, it is revealed that trainer Philip Fenton is facing a court appearance after illegal drugs including Anabolic Steroids are discovered in a raid on his Co Tipperary stable. In one of the shocks of the year (not), Sheik Mohammed is distanced from Godolphin drug-cheat trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni in a report by ex-Met Police chief Lord Stevens commissioned by the Sheik’s team.

RACE OF MONTH: 33-1 shot Splash of Ginge lands the Betfair Hurdle at Newbury under seven-pound conditional Ryan Hatch.

MARCH

Jim Culloty, best known as jockey of three-time Gold Cup winner Best Mate, becomes only the fifth man to also train the winner as Lord Windermere edges home under Davy Russell and then survives a stewards enquiry. But both Ruby Walsh and Jacob suffer season-ending Festival falls. Colleague Joe Tizzard announces his retirement.

RACE OF THE MONTH: Sire De Grugy’s Champion Chase success at the Cheltenham Festival for the popular trainer-jockey combo of Gary and Jamie Moore.

APRIL

Scepticism dissipates as the first Good Friday racing takes place at Musselburgh and Lingfield with almost 9,000 spectators descending on the latter venue for £1m All-Weather Championship day. AP McCoy, crowned champion jump jockey for 19th time, announces that he will carry on and on and on...

RACE OF THE MONTH: Trainer Dr Richard Newland lands the Grand National with Leighton Aspell-ridden Pineau de Re.

MAY 

BHA confirm that 39 of the 40 jockeys who rode in the Grand National face an enquiry into their conduct after another start shambles. Never knowingly undersold, Aidan O’Brien saddles Epsom favourite with a mountainous reputation by saying ‘he’s a Derby horse like we have never had’. Kieren Fallon, fresh from his 2,000 Guineas win, joins what proves to be an ever changing Godolphin jockey roster.

RACE OF THE MONTH: A tactical nightmare of a race but Night Of Thunder wins the 2,000 Guineas to give trainer Richard Hannon a Classic in his first season.

JUNE

BHA announce a policy of zero tolerance to Anabolic Steroids but we will have to wait until March next year for the policy to fully come on stream. Grand National jockeys let off with a caution as starting procedure shown to be shambolic. Marginalised Godolphin jockey Mickael Barzalona heads back to France. McCoy reaches his fastest ever 50 wins and Paul Hanagan wins Oaks on Taghrooda, his first Classic.

RACE OF MONTH: Australia goes some way to justifying the hype with a length and a half victory in the Derby.

JULY

The Queen’s 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate is embarrassingly caught up in a spree of positive drugs test. The cases are linked to contamination of feed blamed on poppy seeds. Goodwood provoke widespread anger by allowing new sponsor 32Red to ditch the historic Stewards’ Cup race title and the BHA announce an investigation into whether ex-jockey Graham Bradley has been breaking rules by training his own horses within Brendan Powell’s stable.

RACE Of MONTH: Raw, sizzling speed from Kingman in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood.

AUGUST

BHA announce chief executive Paul Bittar is to leave while controversially confirming jockey Irish jockey Fergal Lynch, previously banned from Britain after admitting he ‘stopped’ a horse in 2004 can ride in this country again. Two-time champion jockey Jamie Spencer announces he is retiring from riding 24 hours before Andrea Atzeni is announced as his replacement as No 1 jockey for Sheik Fahad’s Qatar Racing.

RACE OF THE MONTH: Sole Power pounces on the line to win the Nunthorpe Stakes under a typically audacious Richard Hughes ride.

SEPTEMBER

Going to the dogs … Towcester sell seven of their 17 fixtures because they clash with meetings at its new greyhound track which opens in December while Newcastle’s plans to dig up its flat course and replace it with an all-weather circuit are blocked, temporarily at least, by the BHA. ‘Jock off of the year’ as Criquette Head-Maarek is granted her request to replace Frankie Dettori with veteran Thierry Jarnet on mis-firing Treve.

RACE OF THE MONTH: Kingston Hill swoops in the St Leger for jockey Andrea Atzeni and trainer Roger Varian.

OCTOBER

Records smashed at Tattersalls as close to 80,000m guineas is splashed out on blue-blooded yearlings, almost a quarter of it from Sheik Mohammed as he signals his intent to hit back after a disappointing summer of results in Britain. Five months after his link up with Godolphin, the marginalised Kieren Fallon says he is considering quitting Britain to ride in America. Written off Treve storms to a second Arc win, is retired and unretired within six days.

RACE OF THE MONTH: Lady Cecil’s Noble Mission produces the perfect finale to Champions Day at Ascot by emulating big brother Frankel with victory in the Champion Stakes.

NOVEMBER

The BHA turn to the bookmaking industry by appointing Ladbrokes managing director Nick Rust their new chief executive. Godolphin’s ever-changing jockey arrangements ended as they appoint William Buick and James Doyle as their jockeys for 2015. BHA in blunderland … wrong race distances at Wetherby, ineligible The Young Master wins at Wetherby and a wrong race distance published at Towcester. The Philip Fenton saga ends with Ireland’s Turf Club banning him for three years.

RACE OF THE MONTH: Many Clouds digs deep to win the Hennessy Gold Cup for trainer Oliver Sherwood and jockey Leighton Aspell.

DECEMBER

Jamie Spencer’s retirement does even last as long as Treve’s as he announces he is to carry on riding as a freelance in 2015. Despite being clear at his enquiry, the BHA signal they will continue to oppose Graham Bradley’s attempts to gain a trainer’s licence. Evolution or revolution? Six new directors, some unknown within the sport, are appointed to the BHA board. Their performances during 2015 will be closely monitored.

RACE OF MONTH: The New One brushes aside the opposition in Cheltenham’s International Hurdle.
