It seems Neil Lennon is going down a different career path since leaving the manager's post at Celtic.

The 42-year-old was pictured wearing a bright pink vest as part of the the media following Spain's 2-0 Group B defeat to Chile on Wednesday.

The Northern Irishman is currently a pundit for BBC's World Cup coverage but looks more like security as Spain talisman Andres Iniesta trudges past him in the tunnel of the iconic Maracana stadium in Rio.

Lennon stepped down as Celtic boss in May after four years in charge at the Glasgow club.

During his time in the Celtic Park hotseat he guided them to three league titles and two Scottish Cups.

The SPFL triumph was the club's third in a row as they finished on 99 points - a staggering 29 ahead of second-place Motherwell.

He also led them into the Champions League last 16, where they famously beat then champions Barcelona 2-1 at home in their group stage November 2012.

As a player he joined the Bhoys in 2000 and was a key member of the side for seven years during a trophy-laden spell.

Lennon's replacement Ronny Deila will hope to replicate his success with Norwegian outfit Stromsgodset at the club.
