Anti-Semitic vandals have scrawled Swastikas on cars and buildings across a Jewish community in north London.

Police stepped in to investigate after vehicles and homes were targeted in the Stoke Newington area leaving residents ‘shocked and fearful’.

Swastikas were daubed on up to 27 cars in and around Osbaldeston Road – in an area that is home to some 20,000 Haredi Jews.

The night of vandalism, on Sunday, prompted extra patrols by police officers while the volunteer Shomrim group, which backs policing in the area, also increased its efforts to find those responsible.

One of the volunteers, Meir Taub, told MailOnline: ‘There is a large Jewish community that lives here with Holocaust survivors and children of Holocaust survivors and to see Swastikas is not a pleasant thing for them. People were shocked, scared and fearful.

‘A lot of damage was caused to a lot of vehicles and there was a lot of concern.’

Mr Taub said there had been early incidents in which Swastikas had been daubed on the walls of a local primary school. 

The group’s coordinator Barry Bard said: ‘Shomrim are committed to bring a stop to these senseless and mindless acts of vandalism, and are working closely with the Police investigation to assist in every possible way.

Police Inspector Jeoff Bull (NE Neighbourhoods, Hackney) said: ‘We will not tolerate anti-semitism or racism of any kind.

‘We are doing our utmost to trace and bring to justice the suspects involved in this racist graffiti as well as reassure all of our communities.’

This afternoon it was confirmed that a 32-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the vandalism.

Hackney police tweeted: ‘With the help of @ShomrimOfficial a 32 year old man has been arrested & is in custody for the anti Semitic criminal damage series in N16.’

The vandalism comes amid warnings that anti-semitism is on the rise across Europe, fuelled by violence in the Middle East.

Delegates at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe heard how there had been an increase in hate crimes across the continent in recent months.
