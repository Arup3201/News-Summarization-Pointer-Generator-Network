Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football. This week, 18-year-old Southampton full back Luke Shaw proves he still has things to improve on defensively in his game, why Manchester United goal poacher Javier Hernandez is failing to find the back of the net and Liverpool's 5ft 6in midfielder is more than a match against bigger opposition...

      ................................................................................................................................................

Nominee: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez is on the shortlist for PFA Player of the Year after a stellar season

1. Luis Suarez is massive odds-on favourite to be the PFA’s Player-of-the-Year as a reward not only for his Liverpool goals but his reformed disciplinary record, with Steven Gerrard second favourite in recognition of the way he has led the team’s title challenge.

Spare a thought, then, for John Terry who isn’t even on the shortlist, even though Chelsea are still just in the title race and are also in the Champions League semi-finals. Aged 33, the Stamford Bridge skipper has played in 44 of his club’s 51 matches, one more than Gerrard including the Liverpool captain’s England games.

Terry has also had just four yellow cards against his name, which is one less than Suarez – and Chelsea have the best defensive record in the Premier League despite Saturday’s shock defeat by Sunderland.

2. Match of the Day rightly gave praise to Southampton’s Luke Shaw for his attacking zest at Aston Villa, but they glossed over the promising young England star’s defensive stats.

Marc Albrighton gave the 18-year-old a tough second half, which included Shaw picking up only his third yellow card of the season for hauling down the Aston Villa winger.

Albrighton found space to put in 11 crosses in all – only Stewart Downing attempted more in Saturday’s games – and it was a relief for Saints that Villa had nobody to get on the end of them.

3. It’s a measure of Manchester United’s problems that Javier Hernandez, sent on to chase the game at Goodison Park with half an hour left, managed just one shot – which was blocked – in that time.

The 25-year-old Mexican is a natural goal poacher who needs people to make openings for him, which might explain his worst ever season at Old Trafford with just seven goals.

He’s had 1,288 minutes on the pitch in all competitions making it a goal every 184 minutes under David Moyes – compared to one every 110 minutes as he helped Sir Alex Ferguson’s title winning team with a total of 14 in 1,541 minutes last season.

4. If any player typifies the way Tony Pulis has got the best from a group of players who were unproven at top level it is defender Joel Ward.

The 24-year-old, naturally a centre half when he made a £400,000 move to Crystal Palace from Portsmouth two years ago, has played every minute of every game in three different positions since Pulis took over. Starting at right back, he then became a holding midfield man, and has now switched to left back during the club’s record run of five straight Premier League wins.

He kept former England winger Matt Jarvis quiet in the 1-0 success at West Ham, as well as making more clearances than any other Palace defender.

5. Stoke’s Jon Walters is paying a high price for the red card he collected for a lunging tackle on Norwich midfielder Alex Tettey last month.

The Republic of Ireland international set up a club record for 103 consecutive Premier League appearances earlier this season – but since returning from his three-match ban he’s been relegated to the subs bench.

Mark Hughes has given him just 18 minutes in three games – although he’s doing his bit to win back a starting place. In the five minutes he did get on at Cardiff he hit the bar and created two chances for team mates.

6. Mesut Ozil showed flashes of promise at Hull but is still struggling to live up to his record price tag despite Arsenal getting back on track to reach the Champions League.

The German whose £42.5 million signing was supposed to bring world class creativity was involved in the build-up to Aaron Ramsey’s early goal.

But, by the time he was taken off after just over an hour, he hadn’t directly created a chance for a team mate or had any sort of attempt on goal himself.

7. Joe Allen at just 5ft 6ins tall is quite capable of looking after himself in the Premier League’s land of the giants.

The Welsh international played a key role for Liverpool in the win at Norwich that put the Reds within touching distance of the title.

Given the task of replacing suspended Jordan Henderson in midfield, the £15million signing from manager Brendan Rodgers’ old club Swansea won ten tackles in his 81 minutes on the field, as well as getting forward to have a couple of attempts on goal.

8. Ian Holloway’s capture of giant striker Stefan Maierhofer, a flop in his first attempt to play in English football at Wolves, has transformed Millwall’s season.

The 6ft 6ins Austrian, without a club when he signed on at the New Den in March after being released by Cologne, scored twice at Middlesbrough for the win which lifted the Lions out of the relegation zone.

Millwall have won three and drawn one of the four games in which the 31-year-old has started.

9. Watford’s strategy of playing musical footballers with the players from Granada and Udinese, the other clubs belonging to their owners the Pozzo family, might not have brought them success this season but at least provides some bright spots for Vicarage Road fans by giving them players they couldn’t otherwise afford.

Spanish winger Albert Riera once cost Liverpool £8million, but is now waiting to link up with Udinese after signing a pre-contract following his release from Galatasaray.

Meanwhile the 31-year-old has been parked at Watford and gave a reminder of his talent with the first goal in a 3-1 win that dented Ipswich’s play-off hopes.

10. Former Burton boss Paul Peschisolido once put a £1million price tag on striker Billy Kee, who he signed on a free transfer from Torquay in August 2011.

The 23-year-old is proving every bit as valuable for current boss Gary Rowett after his 14th goal of this season sparked a 3-0 win over Hartlepool which all but guaranteed a place in the League Two play-offs.

Stockily built Kee, rejected by Leicester at the start of his career, has now got 37 goals from 69 starts during his Burton career.
