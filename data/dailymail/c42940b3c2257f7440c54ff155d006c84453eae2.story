Frank Lampard is set for an emotional return to Stamford Bridge in January after it was confirmed that the Chelsea legend will stay at Manchester City longer than expected.

Lampard was close to tears and refused to celebrate on Sunday when he came off the bench to snatch a dramatic late equaliser against his old club in a 1-1 draw at the Etihad.

The 36-year-old midfielder is almost certain to be available to play when the two title favourites meet again at Stamford Bridge on January 31 after City decided to delay his move to their US franchise New York City FC.

Lampard was due to report for pre-season training in January at the end of his six-month ‘loan’ but will now stay in England until February. New York kick off their first Major League Soccer season in March.

The move would benefit both teams with Manuel Pellegrini holding on to an experienced player at a time when Yaya Toure is away at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Lampard will be in peak condition when he joins his new club.

Lampard is expected to make his third appearance for City on Wednesday when they begin their defence of the Capital One Cup at home to Sheffield Wednesday.

Speaking yesterday before club sources confirmed that Lampard will stay until February, Pellegrini refused to be drawn on the issue.

 ‘I can’t answer that,’ he said. ‘ In January, we will see what happens here and make a decision. It is not a problem at this moment.’

Lampard has been held up as an example for Chelsea’s second string to follow in their Capital One Cup tie against Bolton on Wednesday.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will make a host of changes to his line-up — Ramires is out with a groin strain — and his assistant Steve Holland has told those selected to approach the Bolton game in the manner of Lampard, who spent a trophy-laden 14 years at Stamford Bridge.

‘Without going over the top on Frank Lampard, because he is no longer a Chelsea player, whenever he played in the Capital One Cup against League One and League Two opposition, he played the game as though it was the World Cup final,’ said Holland.

‘Maybe that’s why he’s had the career he has had. And I would suggest that is probably a good line for others to follow.

‘Motivation shouldn’t be a problem. Those players picked should be chomping at the bit to show what they can do.’

Pellegrini will also make several changes against Wednesday, including resting goalkeeper Joe Hart. His replacement Willy Caballero is expected to stay in goal for Saturday’s trip to Hull after waiting patiently since playing in the Community Shield defeat by Arsenal last month.

‘Willy Caballero will have one or two games in a row because he’s a keeper and needs to play,’ said Pellegrini.

City want Hart and James Milner to sign new contracts, but Milner is reluctant to commit his future to the club until he knows if he will be offered enough first-team football. 

Manuel Pellegrini is not worried about going four games without a win after the Chelsea 1-1 draw

The England midfielder set up Lampard’s goal against Chelsea, but said: ‘That was my second start of the season. I just want a fair crack of the whip.

‘I would love to stay at Manchester City but first and foremost I am a footballer and want to play football. When you’re not playing it’s frustrating.’

City have spoken to Greater Manchester Police about security issues surrounding next week’s Champions League clash with Roma at the Etihad. 

The Italian club’s fans clashed with Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford in 2007, resulting in 21 arrests, and there were more ugly scenes when they played CSKA Moscow in Rome last week. Around 2,000 Roma fans will travel to Manchester.

Manuel Pellegrini will look to bounce back on Wednesday but has a list of injuries to consider first
