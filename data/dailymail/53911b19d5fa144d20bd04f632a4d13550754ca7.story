A California court is due to hear from Apple founder Steve Jobs this week - despite the fact he died from pancreatic cancer three years ago.

Jobs, who revived the company's fortunes by designing the game-changing iPod, iPhone and iPad products, will appear before jurors in a video recorded before his death in an attempt to save the company from a $1billion fine.

He will provide evidence to defend Apple from charges that the way it used its iTunes music store forced people into buying iPods and stopped them choosing cheaper mp3 players by rivals.

According to electronics companies and consumers, who have accused Apple of anti-competitive behavior under federal anti-trust laws, the iTunes software helped inflate the price of iPods by stopping other rival devices from getting a look in.

The contentious software is no longer used - but according to the plaintiffs it let Apple make $350million in extra profit from 2006 to 2009.

Old-school: The claims relate to 2006-2009, when iPods (left) reigned supreme. It is claimed the device's value was puffed up by software on the iTunes media player which dissuaded consumers from buying other devices, such as the Creative Zen player, a version of which is shown left

Under federal law, Apple could be liable to a fine of three times that amount - $1.05billion - provided the jury agree that the software was anti-competitive and agree with the estimate.

Jobs died on October 5, 2011, eight years after he was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

He struggled with the disease for years, but continued to be involved in most major product launches up until 2009. After a serious deterioration in his health, he resigned as Apple CEO in August 2011, naming Tim Cook as his successor.

He served as chairman of the company's board until he died. 

Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford, said that the fact that case has gone on for so long that a key witness has died in the interim shows how the legal system struggles to keep up.

He said: 'The fact that this case is still going 10 years later is a sign that technology often outpaces law.'

Attorneys are set to make opening statements Tuesday morning in the Oakland, California courtroom of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.
