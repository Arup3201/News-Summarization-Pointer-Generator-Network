One the eve of her departure as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton left the door open for a possible presidential run in 2016, but said she's 'not inclined' to make a decision on the matter any time soon.

'It is up to me to make a decision on my own future,' Clinton said Tuesday from the Newseum in Washington, D.C. at a 'global town hall' for students. 'I right now am not inclined to do that,' she added.

'I am looking forward to finishing up my tenure as secretary of state, and then catching up on about 20 years of sleep deprivation,' she said.

Clinton also told fans Tuesday that they could expect a book but confessed, 'I don't know what I will say in it yet.'

The
memoir, Clinton's second in 10 years, will likely go into detail about 
the attack on Benghazi and other significant events from her four years 
in the Obama administration.

What it will presumably not address is her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky as she already covered it in her 2003 book, 'Living History.'

Over two pages she wrote how she was 'gulping for air' when President Bill Clinton came clean about his infidelity.

'I could hardly breathe. Gulping for air. I started crying and yelling at him, "What do you mean? What are you saying? Why did you lie to me?" I was furious and getting more so by the second,' she wrote.

'He just stood there saying over and over again, "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was trying to protect you and Chelsea."'

Bill Clinton's own memoir, My Life, was released the following year.

Hillary Clinton revealed her plans for a memoir during the 'global Town interview' in Washington where interviewers from around the world asked her questions.

When quizzed about the biggest regret from her four years as Secretary of State, she said it was 'certainly, the loss of lives in Benghazi.' However, she insisted she will leave her job with 'far more positive memories.'

Clinton laughed off the inevitable question about whether she was planning on running for president in 2016.

'I'm not thinking about anything like that right now,' she said.

Before she tackles the memoir, she said however, that her immediate plans involve 'catching up on about 20 years of sleep deprivation.'
