A group of second grade students protesting the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner staged a demonstration outside their Massachusetts school on Friday.

The 20-odd group of students, aged 7 and 8 years old, held signs that read 'Honk if you want justice' and 'Please don't shoot me, Ferguson' and chanted on the sidewalk beside Alma Del Mar Charter School in New Bedford.

The peaceful event was held during 11:30 recess, but one parent – a local police officer – has complained and accused the school of being 'anti-police'.

George Borden says he found out about the event after a friend noticed his seven-year-old daughter among the protesters and called him.

Students had been sent home last Wednesday to a note alerting parents about a class discussion about race, diversity and the deaths of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, at the hands of the police.

The school says the note gave parents the chance to opt out.

The note didn't mention the protest, because it was an idea the students came up with in class - however Officer Borden, 15-year veteran, isn't buying that explanation.

'I don't think 7-year-olds can come up with the idea to go out and protest on the street,' he told the Boston Globe.

He says he found a flyer in his daughter's backpack urging people to join a weekend protest 'against the unjust systems that allow police officers to kill Black men and boys with impunity.'

Borden told WHDH that the note was 'horrific to me' and that his daughter asked him, 'Daddy, do you shoot people?' 

He is demanding an apology from his daughter's teacher.

Will Gardner, the school's founder and executive director, has said he stands by the decision to let the kids protest as it was part of a lesson in civics.

'We discourage our teachers from sharing their own political and religious views with their scholars,' Gardner added. '[But] we certainly want our scholars to engage in activities that help them to understand what it means to be citizens and what it means to be a democracy.' 

Yasmin Flefleh-Vincent, who's son Rye is in the same second-grade class, has she said she had no problem with the students demonstrating on the sidewalk.

'Never at once did I feel as though there was' an inappropriate tone,' she told the Globe. 'I appreciate the conversation and the discussion at school. I think it's a relevant topic and I respect the teacher.'

Borden claims that incident like this make his job as a policeman even more difficult.

‘Having the children off school property without any parental permission slip is inexcusable,’ he said. ‘I found that extremely upsetting, multiple people I've spoken to felt the same way, I've shown them pictures of this.’ 

Gardner said the pupils from Shabrina Guerrier’s class were told they couldn't do anything that would be anti-police or anti-any other group and had also asked the head of school, Emily Stainer, for permission.

'Obviously, their safety was our first concern, said Stainer.

Gardner also said the protest was completely voluntary and other students who didn’t take part were playing and having normal recess while the protest went on.

He has also spoken with Officer Borden, who has agreed to meet with both the teacher and school administrators to discuss his concerns and come up with productive next steps.
