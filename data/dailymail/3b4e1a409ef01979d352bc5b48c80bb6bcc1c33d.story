Lewis Hamilton sent a motivational message to his Instagram followers from the cockpit of his Formula One car in Barcelona.

The British driver, who is currently testing in Spain ahead of the first race of the season on March 15, posted an 'in-car selfie' alongside the message: 'Have an amazing day today, #TeamLH!! Be GREAT!!'

Hamilton was fresh from Wednesday night's BRIT Awards, where he presented the Best International Female Solo Artist award alongside Ellie Goulding at the O2 Arena, before racing back to Barcelona for Thursday's testing session.
