Setting out her plans: Theresa May has used a speech to sketch out a broad platform for power

Theresa May used a speech setting out her political philosophy to make an extraordinary overture to another leading contender to  succeed David Cameron.

The Home Secretary’s colleagues had expected her to use a weekend rally to try to dampen speculation about her leadership ambitions.

Instead she sketched out a broad platform for power ranging far beyond her Home Office brief.

As well as proposing a new industrial and economic strategy just days before the Budget, Mrs May suggested she wants to allow those running free schools and other public services to make a profit.

That is a key demand of Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has been tipped as a potential leader but has said he does not have the ‘right sort of character for the job’.

She vowed the next Tory manifesto would include a pledge to tear up Labour’s Human Rights Act and said she wanted to examine pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been blamed for preventing the removal of terror suspects.

Maria Miller, the Culture Secretary and one of the most senior women in the Government after Mrs May, yesterday backed her as a potential leader, saying she had ‘fantastic credentials’ for the top job.

The Home Secretary, hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, has become the focus of intense speculation amid rumours of unrest on the Tory benches.

Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes who is not one of the ‘usual suspects’ for discontented criticism of the Prime Minister, wrote yesterday on Twitter: ‘Inner circle still look far too posh, male and white and Cameron is running out of time to fix it.

Mrs May used her speech to the ConservativeHome conference to declare her loyalty to David Cameron, but it is understood that she considers Boris Johnson - another potential leader - to be 'faintly ridiculous'

‘I am a Cameron loyalist but he needs to change his inner circle which just seems to be telling him what he wants to hear.’

'Fantastic credentials': Maria Miller gave her support for Mrs May as a potential leader

Mrs May will not challenge Mr Cameron, and used a speech to Tory faithful at a ConservativeHome conference to stress her loyalty to him. But friends say she is a ‘realist’ setting out her stall in case of defeat in 2015 and Mr Cameron’s departure.

She is understood to regard Boris Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him ever becoming leader. One MP was said to have been approached on Friday afternoon by a fellow member and asked if he would support a future leadership bid by Mrs May.

A hard core of around 25 malcontents is considering a push for a leadership contest if this month’s Budget and local elections in May go badly. In her speech, Mrs May insisted that ‘getting a majority Conservative government, led by David Cameron, is vital in 2015’.

But she suggested she was not convinced the Prime Minister had done enough to persuade voters that the Tories are prepared to take on ‘elites’. Tory MP Conor Burns said it had been ‘refreshing to hear a frontline Conservative speaking of what an unencumbered Tory government would do differently and mean it’.

He added: ‘As I’m well known for my loyalty to Lady Thatcher I’m far from opposed to female leaders.’

Tim Montgomerie, editor of ConservativeHome, said comparison with German chancellor Merkel was apt: ‘Here you have two women who are quite unfussy, quite straight talking and also well known for competence.’

Former Tory Cabinet minister Michael Portillo said he had been guilty of ‘underestimating’ Mrs May.

Britain's Angela Merkel? Comparisons have been made between Mrs May and the German Chancellor

Here is what the woman hailed by her supporters as Britain’s answer to Angela Merkel said ... and what she meant:

Theresa May: ‘Today’s event is all about a choice of leadership – between David Cameron and Ed Miliband.’

What she meant: Mrs May is confident enough to open with a teasing joke that nods to speculation about her own ambitions.

TM: ‘It’s often said that politics is about public service, and of course it is. But to me, it’s about much more than that. Politics is a passion.’

What she meant: The Home Secretary is sometimes branded bloodless and lacking in empathy. Here she challenges that view.

TM: ‘Getting a majority Conservative government, led by David Cameron, is vital in 2015. We’re going to have to fight hard.’

What she meant: Mrs May pledges loyalty to Mr Cameron but suggests she is ready and waiting should he lose in 2015.

TM: ‘The next Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act and we should also consider our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights.’

What she meant: In a deliberate overture to the Tory Right, Mrs May looks forward to Tory rule – without Lib Dem vetoes.

TM: ‘A future Tory government should go further in increasing the number of charities, companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline services. If allowing those organisations to make a profit means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes, that is something we should consider.’

What she meant: In perhaps the most  radical section of her speech she floats the idea of allowing businesses and other groups to run new free schools to make a profit – a key aim of Michael Gove. Mrs May appears to be trying to forge an alliance with the Education Secretary.

Mrs May's words appeared to suggest that she wanted to form an alliance with Michael Gove, left, while she also made an implied rebuke to David Cameron over his handling of NHS chief Sir David Nicholson

TM: ‘We need to think about ... taking on trade unions that are resistant to change and speaking up when people have been let down by big bureaucracy, like the appalling absence of care at Mid-Staffordshire Hospital. It also requires taking on vested interests in the private sector.’

What she meant: An implied rebuke to Mr Cameron for standing by Sir David Nicholson, the head of the NHS, in the wake of a report into the Mid-Staffs scandal. More broadly, Mrs May appears to be sketching out her own ‘underdog Conservatism’.

TM: ‘We need to expand our nascent industrial strategy. We should pursue a relentless campaign to support entrepreneurs and wealth creators – like granting generous tax exemptions for start-up businesses.’

What she meant: A remarkably bold  economic and industrial policy just days before George Osborne’s Budget. Evidently she does not think the Treasury has done enough to boost growth or help business.
