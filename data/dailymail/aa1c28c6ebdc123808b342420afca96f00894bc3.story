A Jack Russell cheated death after she clung to a tiny ledge mere feet from a railway line for four hours.

Gypsy's life was saved by the ledge - that was formed by the recent flooding - and it 'broke her fall' ten feet above the busy Salisbury to London railway line.

But it took four hours for anybody to hear the terrified dog's desperate barking for help in Andover, Hampshire.

Gypsy clung to a tiny ledge mere feet from a busy railway line for four hours after she fell down an embankment

Eventually two passers-by heard her and five fire fighters went to rescue her.

A fireman was then lowered on a rope system operated by his colleagues and lifted Gypsy to safety.

Her brush with death occurred after she left her nearby home after someone thoughtlessly undid the bolt of the garden door while her owner was at work.

Eight-month old Gypsy then plunged down the embankment.

Yesterday fuming owner Jane Alywiye, 57, said: 'It was a miracle she did not land under a train. The ledge was just about 10 feet above the line.'

The grandmother added: 'I am very angry about what happened. The person who undid the bolt and let her out nearly caused me a heart attack - it was a wicked thing to do.

Brush with death: The embankment where Gyspy fell and was rescued by firemen

'She was trapped for about four hours. Miraculously she was unhurt.'

Carer Jane came home from work to find the back gate bolt deliberately undone with no sign of Gypsy.

'Then two people suddenly knocked on my door and said Gypsy was trapped on the ledge down the railway line and was barking furiously.'

Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service sent five firemen to the scene

A spokesman said: 'We lowered an animal rescue specialist on ropes who got hold of the dog and raised her back up the embankment.'
