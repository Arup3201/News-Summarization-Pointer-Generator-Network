A man was filmed having a hilarious sparring contest with a London bus stop - before being knocked out and beaten by the inanimate object.

Bemused passengers waiting for their bus in north London laughed and 'rooted' for the man as they were treated to the one-sided boxing match.

In a video of the fight, which went viral after being posted online, the would-be boxer is seen ducking, diving and punching the temporary stand.

A man was filmed having a sparring contest with a temporary bus stop sign in north London

During the two-minute fighting match, the man is seen grabbing the sign and ducking and diving around the inanimate object

At one point during the two-minute fight, the man falls back into a set of roadwork barriers - after pretending 
to be hit and knocked out by the sign.

Ashleigh Owen, who filmed the bizarre incident, said the man's acting skills were 'admirable' and that he made everyone 'laugh and smile' as they waited for their transport.

She said: 'He seemed to be very aggressive and angry so we felt quite threatened and uncomfortable.

'But it soon became apparent that the only thing he wanted to start a fight with was the bus stop.

Ashleigh Owen, who filmed the video which later went viral, said: 'We 
were rooting for him but unfortunately the bus stop kicked his a*** on 
this occasion'

'He started punching the sign and miming getting hit back by it. His acting skills were quite admirable and he completely threw himself into his little crazy role-play.

'We were rooting for him but unfortunately the bus stop kicked his a*** on this occasion.

'He made everyone laugh and smile and it was all very harmless.'

The video has recently gone viral on social media sites after being originally posted in October last year.

It has been watched more than 6,000 times on YouTube.
