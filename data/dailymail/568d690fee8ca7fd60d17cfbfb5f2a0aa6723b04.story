Team news

West Ham

Sam Allardyce has none of his injured players returning to fitness in time to face Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

West Ham will still be without a host of names for the game at Upton Park, with Matt Jarvis (thigh), Andy Carroll (ankle), Kevin Nolan (shoulder) and Joey O'Brien (knee) all missing and James Collins (hamstring) still a doubt.

On loan Barcelona midfielder Alex Song could make his full debut against Liverpool on Saturday

But Allardyce could yet hand full debuts to Carl Jenkinson, Alex Song and Morgan Amalfitano after the trio all came off the bench in Monday night's 2-2 draw at Hull.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, Reid, Burke, Tomkins, Collins, Demel, Jenkinson, Noble, Kouyate, Song, Poyet, Morrison, Amalfitano, Downing, Vaz Te, Cole, Zarate, Sakho, Valencia.

Defender Martin Skrtel returns to the Liverpool squad to face West Ham after recovering from a knee injury which has sidelined him for three matches.

Fellow defender Glen Johnson (thigh) is unlikely to be ready to come back while Jon Flangan has undergone an operation on a troublesome knee.
