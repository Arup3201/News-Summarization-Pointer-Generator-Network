Ed Miliband today tried to laugh of questions about his future, denying his leadership was in crisis.

The Labour leader used his first appearance since claims one in five of his frontbench team want him to quit to insist it was a 'privilege' to do his job and he does not wish his brother David was in the job instead.

Mr Miliband tried to woo business leaders with a promise never to take Britain out of the European Union, accusing David Cameron of playing 'political games' after the Prime Minister hinted he could back exit without significant changes to Britain's relationship with Brussels.

Ed Miliband today tried to laugh off questions about his future, denying his leadership was in crisis 

Senior Labour figures have admitted the party is having 'jitters' about Mr Miliband's stewardship of the party

A new opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election

Support for Mr Miliband has plummeted even among his party's supporters. Pollsters YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago.

The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader.

Senior Labour figures have publicly admitted the party is having 'jitters' about Mr Miliband's stewardship of the party, and have issued a put up or shut up plea for plotters to 'show us your colours'. 

Today Mr Miliband attempted to brush off the reports, saying he agreed that 'you shouldn't believe everything you read in the papers'.

Appearing at the CBI conference in London, Mr Miliband - who beat his brother David to the Labour leadership - was asked if he wished 'the other guy had won'.

Mr Miliband said: 'Definitely not.

'It is a huge privilege doing this job. What excites me is the way we can transform this country. The country has huge advantages, huge talent.'

Asked if he agreed there was a 'crisis of confidence' in his leadership, he replied curtly: 'No.'

Instead he sought to use his appearance in a room of industry leaders to burnish his business credentials with an unashamedly pro-European speech.

The Labour leader warned threats to leave the EU risked putting the UK 'on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off'

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna

Senior Labour figures today publicly rallied behind Ed Miliband.

But their attempt to shore up Mr Miliband's position risked being derailed when shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna - widely tipped as a possible future leader - appeared to muddle him up with his elder brother David.

Mr Umunna admitted there were 'noises off' about Mr Miliband's leadership, but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It is a small minority of people, who are doing so anonymously and off the record.'

However, in a later interview, Mr Umunna appeared to mix Ed up with brother David, who he defeated by a narrow margin in the 2010 contest for the leadership.

The shadow business secretary told Sky News: 'I know, for my constituency, (we have) a united Labour Party in ensuring that we get David, um, that we get Ed Miliband into No 10. I know ultimately that that's what's going to make a difference to their lives.' 

The Tories have promised to renegotiate the UK's membership before an in-out referendum, but Labour today suggested it would be 'dangerous' to give the public a say.

Support for leaving the EU has risen in recent weeks, in part as a result over the shock demand for Britain to pay an extra £1.7billion to Brussels coffers, which has since been cut to £850million.

Mr Cameron has toughened his position in the face of a surge in backing for Ukip. Today he insisted Britain cannot secure reform of the European Union by just saying it will 'stick with whatever we have come what may'.

However, in a speech to the CBI, Mr Miliband ruled out ever threatening Britain's membership of the EU.

He said: 'There are some people in our country who advocate exit from the EU.

'There are others who flirt with it, thinking they can do so without consequence and perhaps with advantage to Britain.

'In my view both are equally dangerous. Giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the EU, or contemplating it, simply drags us closer to exit.

'And every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business.'

In an attempt to shore up Labour support among pro-EU business leaders, he will claim that 'ever-more incoherent demands' from Mr Cameron has made Britain 'ever-more isolated from its partners', putting the UK 'on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off'.

Mr Miliband added: 'If I am Prime Minister I will never risk your businesses, British jobs, British prosperity by playing political games with our membership of the European Union.

'The way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them. Not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them. Not to make promises everyone knows you cannot keep.' 

Mr Cameron is due to set out detailed proposals for reforming freedom of movement rules before the end of the year in an attempt to reduce the flow.

He has pledged to put Britain's EU membership to an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives form the next government in 2015.

Appearing at the CBI this morning, the Prime Minister defended his plan to put freedom of movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation.

Mr Miliband sought to laugh off growing doubts about his leadership, and rejected the idea he wished his brother David (right) was in charge

The PM said: 'You never get anywhere in life unless you have a clear strategy and a plan,' he used his own address to the gathering to declare.

'And you never get anywhere unless that strategy and that plan includes all the things that matter to your customers and your shareholders.

'Britain's future in Europe matters to our country and it isn't working properly at the moment and that is why we need to make changes.

'I agree with what the CBI has said: we should be looking for a reformed European Union.

'Now I am the politician who has the plan for that reform. Who wants to see the single market safeguarded and not have us ordered around by the single currency countries.

'Who wants to make sure we belong to a Europe that is about a common market and co-operation and not about ever-closer union.

Prime Minister David Cameron, at the CBI conference today, warned Britain cannot secure reform of the European Union by just saying it will 'stick with whatever we have come what may'

'And I want to be part of a Europe that addresses people's concerns including concerns about immigration.

'I am clear: these things can be done. These things can be negotiated and we can then hold that referendum and give people a proper choice about staying in a reformed European Union or opting not to belong to it.'

In a clear dig at Mr Miliband, he went on: 'That is a plan. That is a strategy to secure the best future for Britain.

'Simply standing here and just saying 'I will stay in Europe, I will stick with whatever we have come what may' that is not a strategy, that is not a plan and that will not work.'

CBI president Sir Michael Rake said four out of every five CBI members would vote to stay in the European Union in a referendum because it was 'overwhelmingly' in the UK's national interest.

'Do not be fooled - by withdrawing from Europe, we do not somehow become more open to trade elsewhere. Instead we turn inwards, going against the grain of an increasingly connected world.'
