The real-life feminist bookstore featured on TV show Portlandia may soon close - but not for the terrible customer service exhibited by the characters on the IFC comedy.

In Other Words feminist community center is losing an estimated $600 a month, and may have to shutter their business this February when their lease ends, board members announced at a Sunday meeting. 

The non-profit on Killingsworth St in Portland, Oregon is the inspiration and shooting location for a sketch on comedy show Portlandia, starring Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armisen and former Sleater-Kinney rocker Carrie Brownstein, who play a series of eccentric characters abound the west coast city.

In Other Words feminist community center, which is used as a filming location for the TV show Portlandia, may have to close this year as it is losing an estimated $600 a month

The store on Killingsworth St in Portland, Oregon is used as a shooting location for the IFC show Portlandia. On the show former Sleater-Kinney rocker Carrie Brownstein (left) and Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armisen (right) play workers at a bookstore called Women & Women First 

In one sketch, Armisen and Brownstein play Candace and Toni, two abrasive workers at a feminist bookstore called Women & Women First who are regularly bothered by the customers who visit the shop.

Though the the Candace and Toni sketches are by-far one of the most memorable from the show, the Portlandia crew only pays to film at In Other Words a few times a year and it's not enough to keep the community center open.

'"Portlandia" has given the space the illusion that we're rolling in money,' board member Jane Knechtel said at the board meeting, covered by the Oregonian. 'We are not rolling in money from "Portlandia," and we never have been.'

On set: In Other Words board members held a meeting on Sunday, saying the non-profit was losing too much money. While Portlandia pays to shoot at the store a few times a year, that money alone is not enough to keep the store afloat

Fellow board member Madeline Jaross says closing is likely to be inevitable and that only 'extraordinary circumstances' will keep it alive.

In order to stay open, the board members say there will need to be a major influx of new members, volunteers and donations.

The fate of the bookstore - one of only nine of its kind in the U.S., according to Bitch magazine- will likely be decided at the next meeting on November 8.

Knechtel and Jaross say the non-profit started foundering a few years ago when they lost textbook-sales revenue.

In Other Words was founded in 1993 and moved to its current location on Killingsworth Street in 2006.

Unique: The bookstore is one of only nine of its kind in the nation, and was founded in 1993. It moved to its current location on Killingsworth Street in 2006
