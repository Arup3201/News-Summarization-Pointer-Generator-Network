England’s rivals Uruguay, with spirits already low after the shock defeat to Costa Rica, are also being forced to cope without their favourite caramel spread.

Brazilian customs and immigration seized 86lbs of dulce de leche when Oscar Tabarez and his squad arrived for the World Cup.

It is a sticky sweet spread made from milk, sugar and vanilla, which is incredibly popular on sandwiches, toast, ice cream and pancakes in kitchens all over Uruguay.

Their 
consignment of home comfort was confiscated when they arrived at Belo 
Horizonte’s Confins Airport, near the team’s ranch-style headquarters 
here.

Officials
 from the Brazilian agricultural department have explained that dulce de
 leche is classed as a milk product and special documentation is needed 
before it can be brought into the country.

Uruguay
 have been told they can collect it as soon  as they produce the 
correct  documents or when they leave, which may be soon if they are 
beaten by England in Sao Paulo on Thursday.

The
 Uruguayans had no such trouble taking dulce de leche into South Africa 
four years ago, when they reached the World Cup semi-finals. It did not 
take long for the conspiracy theories to start in Montevideo and the 
poor result against Costa Rica has been blamed by some people on the 
missing spread.

The
 Uruguay team and backroom staff were, however, able to bring in their 
essential green mate tea and can be seen relaxing around the camp here 
sipping the brew from small round gourds through silver straws.
