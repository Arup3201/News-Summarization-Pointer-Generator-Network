Charged: Ravens security director Darren Sanders

The security director of the Baltimore Ravens is due in court charged with a sex offense, it has emerged.

Darren Sanders was a prominent figure in the NFL team's investigation into Ray Rice after the now-sacked player was filmed hitting his then-fiancee in an elevator in February.

Now court records show Sanders, 48, is due to be tried in February on a fourth-degree sexual assault charge.

The incident is alleged to have happened on December 14 and the type of charge generally refers to non-violent sexual assaults.

It carries a maximum penalty in Maryland of a $1,000 fine, a year in jail or both. Previous offenders can be jailed for up to three years.

The summons, listed yesterday by the Baltimore City District Court, shows Sanders' address was given as the Ravens' team headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland.

A hearing in the case, further details of which have not yet been revealed, is scheduled for February 9.

Sanders' attorney Andrew Alperstein told the Baltimore Sun the claims were 'totally fabricated, made up'.

The lawyer added: 'It does a disservice to real victims when people make things up like this.

'People like [Sanders] are susceptible to made-up allegations. It puts you in a vulnerable position. He's had nothing but an exemplary career.'

The Ravens' spokesman Kevin Byrne added the team was aware and had been investigating.

The NFL team, with which Sanders has been associated for a decade, is still reeling from a year of scandal surrounding now-sacked player Ray Rice.

Those condemning Rice included President Obama after video emerged from inside the elevator of an Atlantic City casino of the athlete knocking out his then-fiancée Janay Palmer.

NFL officials initially handed the 27-year-old just a two-game suspension and a $500,000 fine, sparking outrage among domestic violence campaigners.

He later had his $40 million contract terminated by the Ravens after video emerged from the elevator itself.

During the investigation, Sanders denied reports that he had spoken to police in Atlantic City moments after the incident took place.
