The wonderful colour illustrations show a Christmas with plum pudding and party games, houses decorated with holly and stockings stuffed with oranges and nuts.

The Father Christmas ABC, which dates back to 1894, was published by Frederick Warne and Co, a British firm famous for publishing children's books, including Beatrix Potter.
