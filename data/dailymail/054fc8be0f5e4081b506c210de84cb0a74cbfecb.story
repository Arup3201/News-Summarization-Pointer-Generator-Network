Hollyoaks star Jennifer Metcalfe has ordered Dancing On Ice star boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon to leave their home after he dumped her by phone amid reports he developed feelings for new dance partner Samia Ghadie.

The pretty actress reportedly texted her ex with the simple message - 'I want you out - now' and reportedly will dump her lover's clothes on the driveway if he refuses to leave.

Her feisty words come a day after she tweeted pictures of her and two pretty girlfriends out on the tiles after the painful love split which reportedly left the 29year-old actress 'in bits.'

Sources told The Daily Mirror: 'Jen wants to rid their house of everything to do with him. It's all just too painful and she'll put his bags in the drive herself if she has to.

'It's a good thing he's away at the moment, it's the safest place for him.'

The pal added Jennifer's close pals travelled from her hometown in Cheshire to visit the star and the actress tweeted a snap of herself with the caption: 'Just arrived at sammy jacks in tynemouth. Tunes are goin oooofff! (sic)'

I'm okay: Jennifer Metcalfe grinned as she arrived for work in the Whtley Bay Playhouse in North Tyneside on Monday

I'm a survivor: Jennifer is said to be devastated after ice-skater Sylvain Longchambon dumped her after telling her he was 'developing feelings' for new Dancing On Ice partner Samia Ghadie

The actress' ice-dancer boyfriend 
ended their relationship on Friday during a phone call, and reports 
claim he has 'developed feelings' for his new Dancing On Ice partner, 
Coronation Street actress Samia Ghadie.

Jennifer, 29, also met her ex when she was partnered with him on the show two years ago, and she is said to be 'in bits'.

Freinds are reported to be in shock, with one saying: 'Noone can believe that Sylvain let someone as stunning as Jen slip through his fingers.'

Pals have rallied round the starlet, who met her ex when she was partnered with him on the show two years ago.

meanwhile it was work as usual as Jennifer opted for comfort in a onesie, a woolly hat and glasses as she arrived for the matinee performance of show Cinderella as she arrived at the Whitley Bay Playhouse where she is starring in the title role.

While talk of a relationship has been denied, a source close to the actress' former skater boyfriend say he has 'developed feelings' for new partner Samia, 30.

Lovers: Jennifer and Sylvain fell in love on the ice as they filmed the hit ITV show

The
Hollyoaks beauty was said to have thought it just a phase, so was 
devastated when he called her on Friday night from France - where he had
flown to for Christmas - to tell her that their two-year relationship 
was over.

But pals told The Daily Star
that Jennifer was far from prepared for a phone call calling time on 
their romance and they added the slim star, who plays mouthy Mercedes in
the Channel 4 teen soap, won't stay sad for long and warned her ex that 
her upset will soon turn to anger.

But Samia, who split from ex Corrie co-star Will Thorp in Decmeber, has denied there is anything romantic going on between her and Sylvain.

A source close to Samia told the MailOnline: 'She isn't dating Sylvain 
and they haven't seen each other for three weeks. There has been no 
date, there is nothing going on between them.'

The source told the Sunday Mirror: 'When Sylvain first admitted that he had real feelings for Samia, she was gutted.

Working relationship: The pair hung out with their Dancing On Ice colleagues at a London hotel earlier this month

Hot stuff: Viewers will be even more intrigued to see the chemistry between Samia and Sylvain when the show starts in January

'It's been a difficult time but she thought it would pass. She has 
been putting on a brave face for the audiences... he is a consummate 
professional.'

It is sure to be a difficult concept for Jennifer, who is currently 
starring in pantomime, to accept as she and Sylvain met and fell in love
while working on the 2010 series.

At
the time, their on-screen chemistry was impossible to ignore, with 
Jennifer apparently inquiring as to his relationship status as soon as 
they first met.
