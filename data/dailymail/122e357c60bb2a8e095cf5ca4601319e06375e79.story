With their moody murder mysteries, flatpacked furniture, and minimalistic designs, you may be fooled into thinking that Swedish Christmas is a modest affair.

However, when it comes to celebrating the holidays, the Swedes tend to go for more is more - at least in the food and drinks department.

The Swedes celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve instead of Christmas Day, and as one of the most secular countries in the world, the festivities are rarely about the birth of Christ.

This is just the starter: A small version of a traditional Swedish Julbord - Christmas Table - a smorgasbord enjoyed across the country on Christmas Eve

THE FOOD 

Swedish people take their Christmas-time eating very seriously, and most families serve the traditional Julbord (Christmas Table) – a winter-season smorgasbord.

To most Swedes, the idea of only having one kind of meat for Christmas dinner is absurd.

Julbord is eaten in ‘rounds’, requiring several visits to the smorgasbord to refill the plate. Traditionally, the rounds are; herring, salmon and cold meats, entrees, and dessert (if there is still space).

As well as the inevitable different types of pickled herring to start, the most common dishes include Christmas roast ham, Christmas sausages, meatballs (obviously), pork ribs, gravadlax, smoked salmon, beetroot salad, cheeses, and Jansson's Frestelse - a casserole dish made of potatoes, pickled sprats and cream.

The Julbord differs somewhat between north and south, and families hailing from the farming lowlands of Scania often serve geese, duck and eel, while those from the colder latitudes go for reindeer, deer and cloudberry jam. One thing is consistent throughout the land – there is lots of it.

Pickled fish and shots: A proper Swedish Julbord will have at least three different types of herring and shots of frozen aquavit is served in constantly refilled long-stemmed shotglasses

THE DRINK

Drinking during Christmas is considered an artform among Swedes. Glögg, a Scandinavian version of mulled wine is drunk steaming hot with raisins and almonds at any time during the Christmas period, but the real deal starts with the first Julbord round on Christmas Eve. Enter: Aquavit.

Aquavit is a spirit flavoured with botanicals and herbs, one of which must be dill or caraway, which  tends to have an ABV of 35-40 per cent.

Many Swedes have a selection of different aquavits ready in the freezer ahead of  the Julbord. The aquavit is served frozen in long-stemmed shotglasses and works both as a palate cleanser and digestif during the Julbord, which sometimes involves several hours of eating.

Traditionally, someone around the table suggests a toast, which sees the entire table burst into a song known as ‘snapsvisa’ – a short and often humours chanson describing how much the table is going to enjoy drinking the aquavit. When the song is over, the aquavit is 'taken', like a shot.

THE ENTERTAINMENT

The Swedes have a slightly odd tradition of religiously watching the same 1950s Disney cartoons over and over again. To a Swede, there is nothing that says Christmas like Donald Duck.

At 3pm sharp on Christmas Eve, SVT - The Swedish BBC - broadcasts 'Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul' (Donald Duck and his friends wish you a Merry Christmas). 

This is a 1958 Disney Christmas special called From All of Us to All of You, where Jiminy Cricket, Mickey and Donald presents about a dozen animated shorts and clips from Disney films from the 30s-60s.

Millions of Swedes sit down at 3pm and watch the exact same shows year after year(it has been broadcast since 1959). God forbid you would record it or mix things up. 

For a progressive country they sure hate change: Disney's 1958 Christmas Special has been shown on Swedish television at 3pm on Christmas Eve since 1959 - millions still watch every year

And what would a good old Social Democrat Christmas be without Karl-Bertil Jonsson's Christmas Eve, a 1975 animated short-film set during the Second World War. 

It tells the Robin Hood-like story of 14-year-old Karl-Bertil who works in a post office and steals Christmas presents addressed to rich people in order to give them to the poor.

At 7pm, the Swedes gather in front of the television set and try to forget that 13 per cent of them voted for a right-wing anti-immigrant party in the last general election.

The Swedes do not open their Christmas presents at dawn, but instead keep all gifts under the tree which are then handed from giver to recipient in a present ceremony at some point during the day (normally between the Julbord and Karl-Bertil Jonsson).

Like his distant relative Queen Elizabeth II, the King of Sweden holds and annual Christmas Speech, but not until Christmas Day when most Swedes are still recovering from food coma.

ELSEWHERE..

Although the Scandilands have much in common when it comes to Christmas Eve traditions, the foods differ somewhat. 

In Denmark, families stay away from the gluttony of its neighbours, serving Christmas Duck with sugar-fried potatoes and gravy, accompanied by wine.

However, this is only a respite from the snaps and smorgasbord, as the Danes enjoy Julefrokost (Christmas Breakfast, similar to the Swedish Julbord) throughout December, and on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.

The Norwegians generally, also have a ‘smorgasbord-free’ Christmas Eve, but still serve multiple entrees during dinner, such as lamb-ribs, deer, turkey and fish.

The Finns do not stray far from the Swedes when it comes to food (and drink), but there can be no Christmas in the Finnish homes before the Christmas sauna.
