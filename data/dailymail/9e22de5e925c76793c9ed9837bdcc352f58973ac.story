A former Illinois legislator with a staunch anti-gun stance bagged the Democratic nomination Tuesday night in the race to replace shamed ex-U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr.

Robin Kelly will move forward in the race for Jackson’s 2nd District Congressional Seat against Republican Paul McKinley in the April elections.

The Democratic candidate won in large part because of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s super PAC, which gave her more than $2million for the race.

The gun debate played a vital role in the nomination, the first since December’s fatal shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.

Mr Bloomberg’s super PAC, 
Independence USA, dominated Chicago media, showing Ms Kelly’s tough 
stance on gun control.

The super PAC ads were against her Democratic 
adversary, Debbie Halvorson, who unlike Ms Kelly is against banning 
assault weapons.

The nomination means Ms Kelly is a 
shoo in for the April 9 general election, likely sending her to 
Washington, because the Chicago-area district is overwhelmingly 
Democratic.

Ms Kelly defended the financial 
support from Mr Bloomberg, saying: 'No one complains when the NRA was 
spending big money.' In her victory speech she vowed to fight for gun 
control until 'gun violence is no longer a nightly feature on the 
evening news.'

Ms Halvorson conceded Tuesday evening, saying the outside money certainly played a roll.

'It shows, unfortunately, you can't 
go up against that big money. ...That's the problem with super PACs,' Ms
Halvorson, who unsuccessfully challenged Jackson in a primary last 
year, told the AP. 'There is nothing I could have done differently.'

Following the election results, Mr 
Bloomberg expressed happiness of the success on Twitter: ‘Tonight’s 
results are the latest sign that voters across the country demand change
from their representatives,' he wrote.

But not everyone was so happy with 
the New York City mayor’s involvement. Ms Halvorson had warned that 
Bloomberg would try to ‘buy seats’ across the region.

Another Democratic front runner, 
Chicago Alderman Anthony Beale, also took issue with the ads, saying 
people were 'extremely upset' that someone from New York was trying to 
tell people in Illinois how to vote.

'That's what money gets you,' he told the AP after conceding late Tuesday. 'We earned every vote.'

Guns were a leading issue at 
candidate forums and email blasts from candidates, even as Jackson's 
legal saga played out in court and frustrated voters who've seen two 
other congressmen in the office leave under an ethical or legal cloud.

Jackson resigned in November, after a
months-long medical leave for treatment of bipolar disorder and other 
issues, then pleaded guilty earlier this month to charges that accused 
him of misspending $750,000 in campaign money on lavish personal items, 
including a Rolex watch and fur coats.

When asked whether his hospitalization for bi-polar disorder impacted his ability to comprehend the charges against him, Jackson responded, 'I fully understand the consequences of my actions.'

Judge Robert Wilkins said he didn't know what sentence he would give Jackson, but noted that he can go beyond the five-year maximum

Jesse Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty 
earlier this month to misusing $750,000 of campaign funds and 
acknowledged the charges against him, including conspiracy to commit 
wire fraud and mail fraud and and making false statements.

Jesse Jackson Jr.'s spending included:

- $43,350 on a gold-plated men's Rolex watch

- $9,587.64 on children's 
furniture

- $10,105 on Bruce Lee memorabilia

- $11,130 on Martin Luther King memorabilia

- $22,700 on Michael Jackson items, including $4,600 for a 'Michael Jackson fedora'

The charges require a maximum 
sentence of five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 and an order of 
restitution.  Judge Robert Wilkins said he didn't know what sentence he 
would give Jackson, but noted that he can go beyond the five-year 
maximum.

'I'm not bound by the sentencing guidelines,' Wilkins said. 'The sentencing guidelines are advisory, and they are something I am bound to consider.'

When asked whether his 
hospitalization for bi-polar disorder impacted his ability to comprehend
the charges against him, Jackson responded, 'I fully understand the 
consequences of my actions.'

Jackson, 47, has already been ordered 
to pay a judgement of $750,000 and surrender some of the goods he 
purchased.

Jesse Jackson Jr.'s spending included $43,350 on a gold-plated men's Rolex watch and $9,587.64 on children's furniture

Among the items he bought with campaign funds were a $43,450 gold-plated Rolex watch, 
$22,700 on Michael Jackson items, - including $4,600 for a 'Michael 
Jackson fedora - $10,105 in Bruce Lee memorabilia and $11,130 in Martin 
Luther King memorabilia.

Jackson's
wife, Sandi, a former Chicago alderman, is facing a separate felony 
charge of filing false tax returns for six years. She is also planning 
to plead guilty and she faces up to $250,000 in fines and up to three 
years in prison.

But Sandi Jackson will likely avoid 
prison time and instead get probation, consider the couple has two young
children, ages nine and 12.

Jackson's father, the famed civil rights leader Rev. Jesse 
Jackson, issued a statement Monday asking for prayers for his son, his 
daughter-in-law and their children. He noted that Jackson Jr. suffers 
severe mood swings associated with bipolar disorder and that his mental 
health is further strained by the 'press knocking at his door.'

'Jesse remains under tight medical 
supervision,' the reverend said of his son. 'He is struggling with the 
highs and lows of his bipolar disorder.'

'Please pray for him, Sandi and their children,' Jackson Sr. added.

Jackson Jr.'s defense will likely try to use his mental health disorder to lessen his sentence.

Jackson Jr. entered Congress in 1995 and resigned last November due to the federal investigation into his use of campaign funds.

In a statement last 
week, Jackson Jr. apologized to his 
friends and family for his 'errors in judgement.'

'Over the course of my life, I have 
come to realize that none of us are immune from our share of 
shortcomings and human frailties,' he said. 'Still, I offer no excuses 
for my conduct, and I fully accept my responsibility for the improper 
decisions and mistakes I have made.'

He added, 'While my journey is not yet complete, it is my hope that I am remembered for the things that I did right.'
