A lucky Briton could be leaving the bank with a smile on their face tomorrow after collecting a £107,932,603.20p cheque which will make them one of the richest people in the country.

A person has now stepped forward to claim the EuroMillions jackpot prize and a lottery spokesperson has confirmed that the money could be withdrawn from the bank tomorrow.

The identity of the ticket-holder, who scooped the first EuroMillions jackpot to be won in the UK this year, is still unknown.

The Briton, who has not yet come forward, chose the winning numbers on Friday night's lottery.

A National Lottery spokesman said: 'We're delighted Friday's ticket-holder has come forward to claim this 
amazing prize.

'This massive win ranks fourth biggest on the National 
Lottery Rich list and is the first EuroMillions jackpot to be won here 
in the UK so far this year.

'With the 
weather set fair for the coming week, this UK winner is set fair for the
 rest of their lives having just become a multi-millionaire.

‘This single UK ticket-holder will enter the exclusive top five on the National Lottery Rich List – at No 4.’

But the mystery winner's identity is still unknown and may never be revealed.

The spokesman said: 'The ticket holder can then decide whether to go public and share their news.

'There will be no information on whether it is an individual or syndicate winner, or where the ticket was purchased unless the ticket holder decides to go public.'

According to the Sunday Times Rich List for 2013, their new found-fortune automatically makes them the 745th richest person in the UK.

Their wealth exceeds that of musicians George Michael (£105million), Robbie Williams (£105million)  and David Bowie (£100million).           

The main numbers were 6, 24, 25, 27 and 30, with the lucky star numbers 5 and 9. It means they take home a princely £107,932,603.

The life-changing sum could help the winner buy their own Greek island such as Omfori, currently being advertised for just over £41 million, a Lamborghini Veneno, one of the world's most expensive cars at a cost of £2.4 million, and still have plenty left to spend.

Affordable: The mystery man could soon be behind the wheel of a a Lamborghini Veneno, one of the world's most expensive cars - a snip a just £2.4 million

Or the winner could splash most of the money in a single purchase to buy a 21-bedroom home in London's Mayfair, which is on the market for £90 million.

Top of the National Lottery Rich List are Colin and Chris Weir, who banked a £161 million EuroMillions jackpot in July 2011.

In that time, 38 UK ticket-holders have matched five numbers and two Lucky Stars to win the jackpot, or a share of it.

The winning ticket-holder of last night's EuroMillions has shot to sixth place on the National Lottery Rich List. So far, nobody has come forward to claim the bumper prize, Camelot said.

Here are the official top 10 biggest winners since the lottery began:

1. Colin and Chris Weir: £161,653,000The
 husband and wife, from Largs in Ayrshire, said they were 'tickled pink'
 after becoming Europe's biggest lottery winners in July 2011. 

Married
 for 30 years and with two children, the life-changing £161 million 
prize catapulted them into the Sunday Times Rich List above Beatle Ringo
 Starr and Sir Tom Jones.

Psychiatric
 nurse Mrs Weir, 55, and Mr Weir, 64, who worked as a TV cameraman and 
studio manager for 23 years, have reportedly bought a fleet of cars for 
friends since their win as well as a mansion.

2. Adrian and Gillian Bayford: £148,656,000Children's
 nurse Gillian, 40, and record seller Adrian, 41, from Haverhill, 
Suffolk, said they planned to fork out on luxury holidays and cars when 
they won in August last year.

Adrian
 joked to his wife that he had not bought any tickets, before she told 
him to be quiet as she was trying to get their children to sleep as he 
celebrated the win. The couple have since separated.

3. Anonymous: £113,019,926One British ticket scooped the massive prize in October 2010 but decided not to go public.

4. Anonymous: £107,900,000

Last night's winner who is yet to come forward:

5. Dave and Angela Dawes: £101,203,600Dave
 Dawes, 47, a shift supervisor for Premier Foods, and Angela Dawes, 43, a
 volunteer for the British Heart Foundation, hit the EuroMillions 
jackpot in October 2011.

It was only the third time the couple, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, had played the lottery.

6. Anonymous: £84,451,320The haul was won in May 2010 but the winner kept their identity secret.

7. Anonymous: £81,381,673

A winner from 2013, who is yet to come forward: £81,381,673

8. Nigel Page: £56,008,113

Self-confessed white van man Nigel Page, 43, scooped a cool £56 million in February 2010.

The
 skydiving enthusiast, who lived in a three-bedroom semi near 
Cirencester, Wiltshire, married his girlfriend Justine, 42, and moved 
into a mansion in the Cotswolds.

It
 was reported that he paid ex-wife Wendy, 43, £2million after she made a
 legal claim for £8million. The pair had separated 10 years before his 
bumper win.

9. Anonymous: £46,432,285

One British ticket scooped the massive prize in February last year but decided not to go public.

10. Les and Sam Scadding: £45,570,835Unemployed
 mechanic Les Scadding, 58, and his wife Samantha Peachey-Scadding, 38, 
from Caerleon, South Wales, bought one of two winning tickets which 
shared a £90million jackpot in November 2009.

Grandfather
 Mr Scadding was £68 overdrawn on his bank account on the day he bought 
his lucky ticket and had also beaten testicular cancer.

The other £45million-winning EuroMillions ticket was bought by a syndicate of seven office workers based in Merseyside.

The winners - dubbed the Magnificent Seven - were employed by Hewlett Packard to carry out IT work at a BT office in Liverpool.

John
 Walsh, 57, James Bennett, 28, Sean Connor, 32, Alex Parry, 19, Emma 
Cartwright, 23, Ceri Scullion, 35, and Donna Rhodes, 39, each banked 
£6.5million.

Sunseeker superyacht

If a life on the ocean waves appeals then yesterday's winner should get hold of the latest Sunseeker catalogue.

The Dorset company's brand new 155 model would be a ideal choice but at a cool £32million it would take a large chunk out of their new found fortune.

Boasting five bedrooms, enabling then to host up to 10 guests at once, the four-deck yacht also has space for 11 members of staff.

Other perks include a nightclub, day room, 'beach club' and a panoramic viewing platform - which could allow guests a perfect view of the Monaco Grand Prix if Mr Jordan decides to attend the society event.

The yacht is 155ft long and weighs a total of 200 tonnes, with a maximum speed of 22 knots (25mph), and can travel 4,000 nautical miles in a single journey. Filling up the boat's 60,000-litre engine with diesel will cost £30,000 every time.

Rolls Royce Phantom

Lottery winners and Rolls Royce are the perfect match and a top of the range Phantom model is easily within budget at £300,000.

The Phantom is a classic choice for the super rich, and they are all assembled by hand at the Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood, West Sussex.

A-list celebrities David Beckham, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy have all been spotted riding in the car.

It is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the Phantom was presented to the Queen as a gift on her Silver Jubilee.

However, to get the full experience they would need to add a chauffeur.

Private Island

Flashy cars, superyachts and private jets are all very well, but to really join ranks of the super rich you'll need a private Island.

And they could do a lot worse than the stunning Greek Island of Omfori.

The uninhabited island located in the Ionian Sea covers some 4 500 000 sq metres (1112 acres) and is currently up for sale for £40million.

Widely considered one of the most beautiful islands in the region, it features a beautiful beach surrounded by tranquil turquoise waters.

Private jet

First class just doesn't cut the mustard when you've got £100 million burning a hole in your pocket so a private jet is really the only way to fly.

Learjet are the market leaders and we think their 60xr model would be the sensible choice.

With a range of 2,405 nautical miles it shoud be easily capable of taking then and three passengers wherever they want to go.

The cabin is decked out with leather and walnut veneer and it's easily within budget at £8million.

A flat at One Hyde Park

It is the most expensive block of flats in the world with entry level apartments starting at £5million and the penthouse going for eyewatering £65million. Buyers will join a roll call of billionaire residents, including developer Christian Candy, who owns two properties at One Hyde Park. The property tycoon, who built the apartments with his brother Nick, owns two separate flats worth £31m and £26.2m on the 10th floor.Two other apartments were sold for a combined £136 million to Ukrainian mining tycoon Rinat Akhmetov, who is thought to be investing a further £50 million to knock the properties together and refit them.
