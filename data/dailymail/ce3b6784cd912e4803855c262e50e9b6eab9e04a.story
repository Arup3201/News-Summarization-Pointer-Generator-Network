One in ten British people suffer with a sexually transmitted disease and do not seek medical help because they are 'too embarrassed’, according to a new survey.

The research also found that a staggering 25 per cent of Britons suffer with a sexual condition  - from painful sex to erectile dysfunction – yet do not seek treatment  because they are ashamed or  ‘too worried about the outcome.’

The study, conducted by drug supplier UKMedix.com, aimed to find out more about the sexual health of the nation, looking specifically at problems that Britons don’t necessarily seek help for.

The research also found that 25 per cent of Britons suffer with a sexual condition - from painful sex to erectile dysfunction - yet do not seek treatment because they are ashamed or 'too worried about the outcome'

Those taking part were asked if they had any sexual problems that concerned them, but they were yet to seek medical or professional help for. 

The respondents were then asked to state what they believed their ‘secret sex problem’ to be.

According to the results, 35 per cent believed they had an STD, 27 per cent had occasional or frequent erectile dysfunction and 22 per cent suffered pain during sex.

When asked why they had failed to seek professional or medical advice for their problem, the majority, 55 per cent, claimed they were simply ‘too embarrassed’ while 29 per cent admitted that they were ‘too worried about the outcome.’ 

Those with an intimate problem were then asked if they had sought advice from their partner, family or friends instead of a medical professional. 

Nearly two thirds admitted that they’d discussed their secret sex problem with their partner if they were in a relationship, while one in five, said they had turned to friends for advice.

Worryingly, 62 per cent of respondents with a problem claimed that they attempted to self-diagnose using the internet, while 18 per cent had bought over-the-counter medication to self-remedy

Just under 10 per cent admitted they had confided in family members, rather than a medical professional.

Worryingly, an alarming 62 per cent of respondents with a sexual problem claimed that they’d attempted to self-diagnose using the internet, whilst 18 per cent had bought over-the-counter medication to self-remedy.

Peter Farley of UKMedix.com said the findings were worrying because people could be overlooking serious health problems.

He said: ‘It seems that Britons like to keep their [sexual problems a secret], but ignoring a potential medical problem is never a good idea. 

'Whilst it can seem embarrassing, finding out what’s wrong and seeking proper help to rectify it is a much better idea than sweeping it under the carpet - and [potentially] making it a much worse problem.’
