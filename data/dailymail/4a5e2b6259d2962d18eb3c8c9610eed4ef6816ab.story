A Canadian airport is reviewing its security systems after a woman managed to scale a barbed wire fence and run onto the tarmac in an attempt to stop a plane from taking off.

The 37-year-old woman was trying to block an aircraft at Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Nova Scotia because she believed her husband was one of its passengers.

An airport employee who asked not to be identified told The Chronicle Herald that the woman first asked staff at an airline counter to halt the plane because she believed her husband was leaving to see another woman.

But it turns out the woman’s husband was not on any plane at the airport in Eastern Canada when the security breach occurred Sunday morning. 

Sgt Al LeBlanc, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said: ‘It's very unusual. I've never seen such an incident in my many years of policing.’ 

Airport employees scrambled into action when the woman scaled the fence around the perimeter of the airfield. 

She was quickly spotted by workers in the air traffic control tower and they rerouted a small plane that had just landed.

Moments later, the woman was apprehended by employees and held for police, who are not planning to lay criminal charges. 

The unidentified woman suffered minor cuts when she scaled the barbed wire fence.

The woman did not come into contact with an aircraft.

Halifax International Airport Authority spokesman Peter Spurway told journalists it was the only time he can recall someone breaching security and making it onto the airfield.

In addition to a 10-foot fence, the airfield is protected by cameras and infrared sensors used to detect intruders.
