Arrest: William Lindauer, 31, allegedly set his family's home on fire a year after his divorce

A man has been arrested on arson charges after firefighters raced to his burning Colorado home and found 'my wife is a cheater' scrawled on the outside of the house.

William Lindauer, 31, was taken into custody hours after the early-morning blaze on Nelson Street, Arvada on Tuesday, police said.

He made his first court appearance in Jefferson County court on Wednesday morning.

Jail records show he is being held on investigation of first-degree arson, reckless endangerment, prohibited use of weapons, cruelty to animals and criminal mischief, ABC7 reported. 

His wife filed for divorce in October 2013 and it was completed on February 18, 2014, the channel reported.

Property records list him at the address with Brianne Lindauer, 29. 

Neighbors said that three young children lived at the home but that they had not seen the woman or her children in weeks, ABC7 reported. 

The Arvada Fire Protection District said everyone in the home had been accounted for and there were no reports of injuries. 

After multiple calls from neighbors, the district responded to the home early on Tuesday and found it engulfed in flames.

'Upon their arrival, they were faced with a lot of fire that was coming from the front of the house as well as the back of the house,' spokesperson Deputy Fire Marshall Deanna Harrington told the Denver Post.  

Crews were initially unable to enter the home because the floor has been weakened by the 'very significant' damage, she said.

They also found a name had been painted on the side of the house but it is not clear if he is connected to the fire.

After the flames were brought under control, officials covered up the scrawled words with blue tarps.

Debris was also found in the street, including patio furniture, fire officials said.  

Police said that investigations showed the fire had been intentionally set.

The Arvada Fire Protection District and Arvada Police Department are conducting a joint investigation into the blaze.

Neighbors expressed their shock over the incident. 

'It's a younger family,' Fred Holman told KDVR. 'They've lived here about five years, maybe a little longer. They're very nice people, very good neighbors. I would never think anything like this would happen.'
