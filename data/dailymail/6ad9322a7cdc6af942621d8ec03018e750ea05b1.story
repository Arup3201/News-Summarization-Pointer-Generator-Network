England were written off as World Cup no-hopers by former players like Michael Vaughan and Graeme Swann before they arrived in Australia but here they have been backed as a surprise package by perhaps an unlikely source.

Kevin Pietersen may have trashed England in his controversial autobiography but he left Perth on Sunday after bowing out of the Big Bash League with some encouraging words for the team that have moved on without him.

‘Now they have got Eoin Morgan as skipper I think England are going to go really well,’ said Pietersen, who found success and enjoyment with Melbourne Stars. ‘They’re getting scores over 300 and Ian Bell is batting beautifully.’

Both Vaughan and Swann suggested England ‘did not have a cat in hell’s chance’ of winning the World Cup before they replaced Alastair Cook as captain with Morgan and it is the change at the top that has led to Pietersen’s optimism.

‘I’ve been in that team and players talk,’ he said. ‘If Cook’s position was being spoken about as much as it was on TV and in the media then I know it was being talked about in the dressing room.

‘I’m just happy it was done for Cook’s sake, for England’s sake and they can move forward with the one-day side now. You can just see it with the scores they are getting now. I know there was a stutter against Australia in Sydney but that can happen and doesn’t mean anything.’

Pietersen has less faith in an England bowling line-up that lacks the variety of a left-arm bowler in both pace and spin. ‘It’s a very exciting batting team, I just have a little reservation about the bowling,’ he said.

Ben Stokes also found form, but was demoted to the England Lions tour and Pietersen says that's a mistake

‘Jimmy Anderson looks great but Broady doesn’t look quite right. He’s not bowling as fast as he could which might be down to coming back off his knee injury. Hopefully he will get a bit faster.

‘I just think England missed a trick with Ben Stokes. Imagine him batting at three and doing a Jacques Kallis job? He came out here to the Big Bash and first game, batting at three, he hit 70-odd from 30 balls.

‘Just imagine him in that line up? Ali, Bell, Stokes, Root, Morgan, Bopara, Buttler. Would you want to bowl at that?’

Pietersen clearly hasn’t changed his opinion on James Taylor, who he said should have followed his father and become a jockey rather than a cricketer in his book. And he believes that Stokes long run of poor form with both bat and ball going back to England’s tour of West Indies should have been overlooked.

Pietersen, whose future in English cricket is in doubt, hasn't changed his opinion on James Taylor

‘He’s had a poor year but he’s been up and down and thrown around,’ said Pietersen of the Durham all-rounder. ‘he’s played a lot of cricket against sub-continental teams whereas the World Cup is in Australia and he was one batter last year who did so well here, scoring that century here in Perth.

‘I understand he’s had a poor run but that was mainly on the sub-continent and against spinners.’

Pietersen has now returned to England where his future in the domestic game is very much in doubt with Surrey having no plans to re-sign him for this season. But clearly he feels that England are now moving in the right direction.
