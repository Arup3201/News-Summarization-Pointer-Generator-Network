Entrepreneur Karl Baxter, 36, has been left with with 10,000 unsellable DVDs about cyclist Lance Armstrong

It is a tale that would not be out of place in the Only Fools and Horses sitcom.

Entrepreneur hunts for bargains, spends £10,000 buying 10,000 DVDs, and then can't sell them.

And Karl Baxter, 36, faces losing £30,000 in profit after buying a huge  batch of unsellable DVDs about disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong and his winning strategies.

He bought 10,000 of them wholesale for £1 each last September.

Nobody wants to buy the DVD, the Science of Lance Armstrong, since it emerged the American used drugs to win his seven Tour de France titles.

He has had to cut the asking price from £3 to 30p in a bid to get rid of them, which would leave him with a £7,000 loss.

If he doesn't sell them, his three-year-old boy will play dominoes with them instead, he said.

Armstrong always denied using performance enhancing drugs since he was first accused in 1998.

But
last August he effectively admitted to taking drugs by refusing to 
challenge the US anti-drug agency's decision to strip him of his titles.

Last week he confessed to taking drugs to millions of TV viewers on Oprah Winfrey.

Karl, from Poole, Dorset, accepts that buying the DVDs was a huge mistake.

He said: 'I bought the DVDs at a good price for about £1 each about four months ago.

'The
idea was to sell them in small job lots of 100 for about £3 each, so 
traders could go on eBay, Amazon, or car boot sales and sell them on.

'There was a slight amount of risk and a gamble because there was a suspicion, but he wasn't admitting to it, so I put them on the website last week.

'I was hoping the problem would die down and I would be able to find a good home for them, now I don't think I will get a tenth of the money back.

'Armstrong has had a good life for the last 20 years, I just wish he had either kept his mouth shut a bit longer or not done it in the first place.

'But, he has done a lot for charity so we can't knock that and I'm sure that's done more good than what loss we have made.

'I don't know what I'm going to do with them now.

'We could run a competition and offer them as booby prizes or I could make a tower or build a big dominoes track for my three-year-old.

'If I put the prices down to 50 or 30p I am sure someone will be interested.

'It is a big loss for a small business but this is one of the few things I've managed to buy that has come back to bite me.'

The Science of Lance Armstrong is a 46 minute documentary that was made in 2006 by the Discovery Channel.

It tells how Armstrong's 'winning strategies' were developed and looks at technology a cyclist can use to help them go faster, such as material types. The DVD is available here.
