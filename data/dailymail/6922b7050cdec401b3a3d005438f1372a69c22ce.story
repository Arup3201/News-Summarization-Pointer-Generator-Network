These children really had better watch out - as they pose for photos with a gun-wielding Santa Claus.

The bizarre event saw visitors as young as six gleefully queuing to meet the AK47-armed king of Christmas.

Others were snapped with were an AR-15 or an FN-SCAR-17.

Happy holidays! Visitors as young as six gleefully queuing to meet the AK47-armed king of Christmas

The charity event, which took place at Sandy Springs Gun Club and Range, near Atlanta in Georgia, USA, was held on Saturday.

All guns were deactivated and this was the first year the event has taken place, the range confirmed.

Despite having more than 1,000 members the event was targeted more towards the greatest of gun enthusiasts.

Christmas fun: Organizers of the charity event near Atlanta, Georgia, said it would promote gun safety

Say cheese! Santa put a caring arm around the visitors as they brandished two of his guns

Excited: Staff running the event couldn't resist getting their own reindeer-themed armory shot

Christmas card: He may be dressed for the occasion, but one reveler looked alarmed as he clutched a gun

For parents uncomfortable with their children being around weapons there was also the option of being photographed with an unarmed St. Nick.

All proceeds from the event went to the Sandy Springs Community Assistance Center.

As well as helping visitors get in the Christmas spirit the range claimed the photo opportunity was also a chance to educate people about gun safety.

Only visitors over the age of 18 were permitted to hold the guns but all were encouraged to check them out

Positive response: According to organizers, these women were two of dozens that flocked to join in

Couple time: People of all ages came to sit on Santa's lap and talk about Christmas and rifles

Tis the season to be... shooting? Many took the photos home as a memento or to use as a Christmas card

Robyn Workman Marzullo, co-owner of Sandy Springs Gun Club and Range, said: 'The response has been tremendously positive.

'We had people from ages six to 76 taking photos with Santa - many of them with their favourite firearm.

'Safety is our number one concern. We made three of our firearms available for photos and all these pieces were unloaded, inspected and deactivated.

'We handle all our firearms very seriously.'
