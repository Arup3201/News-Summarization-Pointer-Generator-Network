Alastair Cook acknowledged his drop of man of the match Kumar Sangakkara was damaging as England lost the sixth one-day international against Sri Lanka in Pallekele.

Sangakkara, dropped by Cook at mid off on 41, hit a run-a-ball 112 at the Pallekele International Stadium in his last one-day international on his home ground.

It set up a 90-run success which consigns England to a series defeat with one match to play.

Cook said afterwards on Sky Sports: 'It didn't help, me dropping "Sanga" on 40 was a really costly drop.

'That was a really big catch to drop at that time because we'd built up quite a lot of pressure on them.

'It was probably a 260 (run) wicket and credit to him, he made us pay for that.'

On his own struggle for form, Cook said: 'It's hard. You want to score runs and set the platform at the top of the order. I've done it before.

'We came here to try to make it three wins and didn't play well enough. Sri Lanka outplayed us today, in all forms.'

England coach Peter Moores said: 'We felt we could draw the series level today but we've been outplayed in all departments.

'We probably bowled our best up front. Towards the end our plans have to be a bit clearer, a bit simpler. Not just bowling yorkers but matching the ball you bowl to the field you've got, although the yorker is still a great ball if you bowl it well.

'We made some errors and didn't field as well as we could have.'

On Cook's plight, he added: 'Everyone understands people struggle at times. It's tough on Alastair because he had the chance to take a catch and got out early.

'He's desperately trying to get himself some form and working very hard to do that.

'He's a very solid catcher - I'd have backed him nine times out of 10 to catch that. But confidence is a massive part of anyone's game.

After putting down Sangakkara, who got 112, Cook was out LBW to Sachithra Senanayake for just one

'He's our most successful Test match centurion and has had great success as a one-day player. He's in a tough patch at the moment but working hard to get out of it.'

Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews said: 'It was a challenging wicket to bat on but 'Sanga' was amazing once again.

'Together with (Tillakaratne) Dilshan, they were brilliant and set the tone for us to launch at the end.

'The older he (Sangakkara) gets, the more runs he scores.'

Sangakkara himself added: 'It's great to have grown up in Kandy and gone to school here ... to play one of my last games here is a special feeling.

'I've had a wonderful career and it's extra special to finish off with a win.'
