More than 30,000 Israelis came out today to say a final farewell to a 24-year-old volunteer soldier from California who was killed fighting Hamas militants last weekend.

Scores of soldiers dressed in the olive-green uniforms of the Israeli Defense Army wept and embraced  at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem Wednesday morning during the funeral for Sgt Max Steinberg.

Steinberg, an American-Israeli dual national, is one of two American members of the IDF - the so-called 'lone soldiers' - who were killed during a skirmish in Gaza Sunday.

Steinberg, who grew up in Southern 
California and lived in the Israeli city of Beersheba, joined the 
Israeli army in late 2012, according to the Jewish Journal of Greater 
Los Angeles.

Most of 
the participants of the solemn service for Steinberg did not personally 
know him but answered a plea on social media asking for people to come 
out and honor the fallen soldier.

'I
 came out to support the family after I heard on social networks that 
most of his relatives were not in the country,' Eli Stern, 29, from
 Lod, told Ynet.com. 'I don't know him but I felt like I have to be here, so that his 
parents arriving from aboard feel like the entire nation stands behind 
them and that Max has not died in vain.'

Max's friends and dignitaries, including Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, lauded the slain soldier as a true Israeli hero, Israeli National News reported.

Addressing
 Steinberg's parents, Evelyn and Staurt, and his siblings, Jake and 
Paige, Rabbi Dov Lipman said that not only did Max give up his life to 
help save the lives of thousands of others by fighting to stop rockets 
from raining down on Israeli cities, but his act of heroism also has 
become a source of inspiration for millions of Jews around the world.

‘Max
 has helped to rekindle the Zionistic spirit which gave birth to this 
state, and has reminded all of us of the blessing from God, the special 
merit that we have to live as a free people in our land – as well as the
 sacrifices we must make to maintain this reality,’ Lipman said in his 
eulogy.

Lipman, a member of the Israeli Parliament and himself an immigrant from the U.S., concluded his remarks by thanking Max for his ultimate sacrifice.

‘Thank you for protecting our children, thank you for protecting our state, thank you for protecting the Jewish people, and thank you for showing us that a regular American boy from California can raise himself to the level of Jewish and Israeli hero,’ Rabbi Lipman said.

Max, who 
grew up in Southern California's San Fernando Valley, joined six months 
after he visited Israel for the first time on a Birthright Israel trip 
with his younger brother and sister in June 2012, according to his 
brother Jake Steinberg.

The
 24-year-old's family said that standing at only 5 feet 3 inches, Max 
did not seems like a shoo-in for an elite unit fighting on the front 
lines, but the young man nicknamed 'Little Dynamo' felt that serving in the Golani Brigade was his calling, the Jewish Journal reported. .

'He got 
there and felt a connection to Israel, saw that as a place he could live
 and be successful, and he went for it,' brother Jake said.

During the emotional funeral, Evelyn Steinberg placed her slain son's Army ball cap emblazoned with the Golani logo on her head with the words: ‘We want to thank all of you who have come to the funeral today.

‘We are proud of our son, who fought for Am Yisrael. Max believed that one day he would be able to make Israel his home. When he was called to the army, he told them, "or you make me a Golani, or I'm going back home!"' she added, according to the site Aruz Sheva.

Max, a sharpshooter, was among 13 Israeli soldiers and scores of Palestinians over the weekend who died during the first major ground battle in two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas.

On the eve of the deadly firefight, on Saturday night, Max called his parents to tell them he was sore from an accident involving two military vehicles but otherwise unharmed.

'He said, "My friends are there and I’m going back in,”' his mother recalled to the Jewish Journal before the funeral.

During the services Wednesday, Rabbi Lipman told the congregation that during that Saturday phone call, Max also told Mrs Steinberg: 'Mom I'm not scared at all for me, I'm scare for you. I'm fine.'

Before Steinberg returned to Gaza Sunday, his last conversation was with his father, Stuart.

'The last thing he said to my husband was, "Tell my mom I love her,”' Evie Steinberg recalled.

 Thousands of people attended Carmeli's funeral in the northern Israeli port town of Haifa after a Facebook status called for Israelis to come in droves so that the lone soldier would be not be alone at this final resting place.

Carmeli was the youngest of three and has two sisters who currently live in Israel. He was 'loved by his parents infinitely' 

Nissim Sean Carmeli, 21, the second American killed, was from South Padre Island, Texas, and he felt that same strong connection to the country he had only moved to four years ago.

There are about 2,000 lone soldiers 
currently serving in the military, said Marina Rozhansky, spokeswoman at
 the Israel Consul General in Los Angeles.

'Lone soldiers are a kind of star in Israel,' according to the Jewish Journal report.

'For Israeli kids, army service is a rite of passage. But because it is a choice for the young members of the Diaspora who re-direct their own life paths to protect Israel, those enlistees are given a hero's welcome - and a lifetime of Shabbat dinner invitations from their fellow soldiers, who become their surrogate families.'

Some 20,000 people, most of them strangers, attended Carmeli's funeral in the northern Israeli port town of Haifa after a Facebook status called for Israelis to come in droves so that the lone soldier would be not be alone at this final resting place.
