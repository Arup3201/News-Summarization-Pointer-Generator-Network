A mother teaching her 14-year-old daughter to drive was shot in the head in a road-rage attack and is not expected to survive.

Tammy Meyers, 44, is in hospital on life support machines after the shooting in the outskirts of Las Vegas.

Police believe the shooter followed 44-year-old Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire.

Speaking late Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, said: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive.

'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.'

However, according to local news station KSNV, Meyers left the life support machines on Thursday night on doctors' advice - who said to keep them active for 48 hours in case she improves.

Mrs Meyers let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said.

She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. 

He described the girl as emotionally distraught.

Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car.

Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said.

Investigators were looking for the shooter and at least one other person in the vehicle, Garcia said.

Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side.

Meyers also said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police.
