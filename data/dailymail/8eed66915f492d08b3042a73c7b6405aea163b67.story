With temperatures in the Gulf still baking hot, wealthy Arabs are seeing out the end of the summer in London's rather milder climes. And, in what is becoming an annual tradition, they have brought their supercars with them.

As these astonishing pictures show, the streets of Knightsbridge and Mayfair are still currently lined with expensive motors which have been shipped over to Britain while their owners seek shelter from the sun (not to mention some retail therapy) in the capital.

With their Arabic number plates they're a traffic warden's nightmare but a car spotter's dream, with marques including Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Forgiato, and Lamborghini.  And they've all had the requisite custom paint jobs.

Fans of the ostentatious cars, known as the 'carparazzi', are descending upon London to photograph the often extremely rare vehicles.

But local residents are not fans of the supercar spectacle, complaining the drivers take the parking spaces without respecting parking rules. 

Others complain of drivers revving their cars' engines and treating the well-heeled streets as a racetrack until the early hours of the morning.

However, as this top picture taken outside the Dorchester shows, either the cars' owners - or perhaps more accurately, their chauffeurs, are rather good at reverse parking - no mean feat when the car involved is worth north of £1million.

Flashy: This line-up of two Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupés, two gold-plated Land Rovers, a Lamborghini, a Ferrari and a Bugatti Veyron, is worth at least £3.1 million

They can afford a parking ticket or two: This exclusive Ferrari is one of many ultra-expensive cars to have hit the streets of the capital within the past few months

Summer: Wealthy residents of Arab countries frequently transport their cars to London during the summer months to escape the stifling heat in the Gulf

Glamorous: The cars - including a Forgiato C7 Corvette Widebody - have been zooming around pricey parts of the city such as Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Kensington

A Kuwaiti car covered in Arabic writing (above and below) as well as photos and social media tags is one of the more unusual sights for the 'carparazzi' fans

Sleek: The vehicles, such as this Ford GT (above and below), have been attracting admiring looks from passers-by this summer as their owners shelter from the heat

Colourful: The cars are often in eye-catching shades and have been customised with scant regard to price or, some might say, taste

You wouldn't call it understated: This gold-plated Ferrari is parked outside Harrods, where it has received a traditional British summer soaking

High roller: A Lamborghini with an Arabic licence plate parked on double yellow lines outside five-star hotel 45 Park Lane, which overlooks Hyde Park

Shopping trip: An enormous SUV parked outside Harrods, the landmark department store in Knightsbridge, a favourite for supercar owners

This matte blue Ferrari (above and below), one of several on the city's streets with a Kuwaiti numberplate, has had a soaking in a London rain shower 

End of the season: Many of the supercars will soon return to the Middle East - but some, like this Audi R8, appear to be based in Britain full-time

Glitzy: This silver Mercedes (above and below) was yet another one of the glitzy cars to zoom past the Dorchester, infuriating residents on central and west London

This white Pagani Huayra (above and below) - one of the supercars transported over to London for the summer  by its rich Arab owner - was seen on double yellow lines

The sports car, which can sell for up to £850,000 and can reach speeds of more than 200mph, was seen parked out Harrods in Knightsbridge this week

Despite being built for the desert sands, a converted Mercedes G63 AMG - worth an estimated £350,000 - was among the cars stuck in traffic in west London this week
