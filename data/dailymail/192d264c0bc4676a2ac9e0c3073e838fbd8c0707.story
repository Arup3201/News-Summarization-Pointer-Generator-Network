The public has lost faith in government claims about tackling immigration because it does not tally with what they see on the ground, Nick Clegg will admit. 

In a speech on immigration tomorrow, the Deputy Prime Minister will say it is ‘no wonder’ that people do not believe what ministers tell them when they have been ‘repeatedly told one thing only to then see another’.

He will speak out in favour of the free movement of European citizens but seek reforms to ensure that fewer Eastern Europeans move here if more countries are admitted to the EU in future.

Labour’s welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves will also call for reforms to the freedom of movement – to tackle benefit tourism – in a speech tomorrow.

But the Tories claim her idea – to stop people being able to claim welfare unless they have built up sufficient National Insurance contributions – was likely to be illegal under EU law.

The two speeches on immigration from Labour and Lib Dem politicians indicate that both believe they need to speak tough on the issue in the run-up to next May’s general election.

On Saturday, Labour’s Ed Balls said the party could not win the election unless it became tougher on immigration.

The surge by Ukip – which stands on an 
anti-immigration platform – in May’s European elections particularly 
unnerved the Lib Dems, who were reduced to one seat. To tackle this 
perception, Mr Clegg will say tomorrow that more needs to be done on 
migration from Europe.

‘I want to be unequivocal: freedom of movement between EU member states is a good thing,’ he will say. ‘It’s a cornerstone of European integration; a right enjoyed by around one and a half million British citizens who live on the other side of the Channel.

‘It is necessary in order to be part of the world’s biggest single market where goods and people can flow between nations.

‘Those who wish to undo it should be careful what they wish for: the blow to UK prosperity would be immense.’

But he said freedom of movement needed reform to make it clear it was a freedom to work, not a freedom to claim benefits.

He said that, if the EU expands in future, there need to be tougher transitional controls so that fewer people from poorer countries can come here in search of work. Mr Clegg will say: ‘In 2004 Labour said up to 13,000 people from countries like Poland and Hungary would come here every year. The real figure was around 170,000.

‘When Romania and Bulgaria joined, Labour said no one from those countries would arrive ahead of the transition controls being lifted this year. Yet 60,000 Romanians and Bulgarians were already working here through a loophole for anyone who registered as self-employed.

‘Is it any wonder – when people have been repeatedly told one thing only to then see another – that so many have lost faith in government’s ability to manage the flow of migrants from new EU states?’

Get tough: Boris Johnson will warn David Cameron that Brussels will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull Britain out of the EU

Boris Johnson will throw down the gauntlet to David Cameron this week – by warning that Brussels will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull Britain out of the EU.

A study by the London Mayor’s economic adviser, banker Gerard Lyons, says leaving the EU is ‘definitely a viable option’ and would be better for Britain than staying in an unreformed institution.

Mr Johnson will use the findings in a speech in which he is expected to say that the UK should ‘not be frightened’ of leaving the EU – a stark contrast to the position of the Prime Minister, who wants Britain to stay in.

Mr Cameron has pledged a referendum on EU membership by 2017, following Brussels reforms, including a crackdown on benefit tourism. But Mr Johnson is understood to believe that the strategy will not ensure success.

A source close to the mayor told The Sunday Times that he believes Mr Cameron must be ‘bold’ in his demands in the renegotiation of membership and the best way is by showing he has ‘no fear’ of departure if the talks fail to deliver.
