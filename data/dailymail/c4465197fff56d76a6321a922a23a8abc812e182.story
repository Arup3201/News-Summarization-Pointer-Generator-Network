Ed Miliband has admitted he turned to his spurned brother David for advice on his keynote speech at the Labour conference in Liverpool.

The revelation came as a party member blasted the brothers' feud as a 'cloud hanging over Labour.'

Mr Miliband said his brother had advised him to 'be his own person' in the speech, and the Labour leader followed it up with an attack last night on the Government's cuts to public sector pensions.

Mr Miliband has faced criticism for a lack of strong policies since he beat his brother in last year's leadership contest.

He has now criticised David Cameron for wrongly 'slapping a three per cent per cent tax rise on 
public sector workers without properly negotiating'.

His insistence that the Prime Minister needed to talk to the unions will be well received after Unison's Dave Prentis said this week that millions of workers expected support from Labour.

But Mr Miliband was challenged over his troubled relationship with his brother during a question and answer session at the conference and urged to bring David back from 'political Siberia'.

Minal Supri, a special constable from Leeds, asked: 'Don't you think it's time to bring David out of political Siberia and for once end all the rumours and innuendo about backbiting?

'Because this party is not going to win if people focus on that and that is what the media is focusing on.

'We need to unite and we need to move forward otherwise we are not going to win in 2015.'

Mr Miliband acknowledged that his defeat of his brother, who is missing the party conference and instead giving a speech in the U.S., had been 'difficult for us'.

He said: 'David is a massive asset to our politics and our party... I have always said I would be happy to have him back, I want to have him back, but in the end he has got to decide what is the right thing for him to do.

'He has been incredibly supportive to me in relation to the speech I gave on Tuesday and throughout the last year.'

But Ms Supri said later: 'I wanted a straight answer and I didn't get one. We want the party to unite and Ed to put an end to this once and for all. This is a cloud hanging over Labour.'

The Labour leader tried to emphasise his closeness to his brother by detailing how David had helped him him develop his vision.

He said: 'I talked to him before the speech, he's currently abroad, and he gave me good advice. The advice was "be your own person, say what you think" and that's what I did and that's what I'm going to keep doing.

'What I've set out is a vision for how we can change this country and where I stand - against the closed circles of Britain that hold people back. We've seen that today, the top universities not doing enough to open up to state school pupils, that's wrong, I think it's got to change.

'How are we going to take on the vested interests at the top of our society, whether it's the energy companies or the banks, real changes that can help the people of Britain?'

In his latest stand against Mr Cameron's pensions changes, Mr Miliband said: 'The most important thing is that we have proper negotiations and the Government engages seriously in the negotiations.

'At the moment what the Government has done is slapped a three per cent tax rise on public sector workers without properly negotiating, without it being recommended by an independent report.

'I say the Government should not be doing that, it should be engaging in proper, serious negotiations with the trade unions.

'It's their responsibility to stop the strike, which is after all scheduled for two months' time if a ballot goes through, it's their responsibility to stop it happening.'

Mr Miliband now has the freedom to choose his own frontbench team instead of seeing them elected, after the conference changed the party's rules.

But he refused to comment on the possibility of an imminent reshuffle, saying: 'I've got an excellent team. I think it's right to change the rules though, because I don't think the public want us looking inwards having shadow cabinet elections - the old system - but looking outwards to them.'

Jasmin Beckett, from Liverpool, was the real star of the show as she told Mr Miliband about cuts at her school, Holly Lodge Girls' College.

The 15-year-old won warm applause after describing how her school was being 'attacked by the coalition Government' .

The Labour leader was also given a rough ride by disability rights campaigner Kaliya Franklin, 35, from Wirral, who claimed he was 'reinforcing the destructive rhetoric' on welfare by talking about someone he met who was on sickness benefits and could have worked.

Mr Miliband replied: 'I'm not questioning the fact that he genuinely had an ailment... but I just say to you the system didn't demand that he go back to work, the system wrote him off.'

He added: 'I genuinely don't think that saying you are tough on abuse of the benefit system is a non-Labour thing to do. I think it is fundamentally a Labour thing to do.'

He went on to reject calls for a referendum on EU membership, said strikes should only ever be a 'last resort' and said he would like to see more working class MPs.

He said that the Arab Spring had taught him that it was 'wrong' to support dictators in the Middle East and North Africa on the grounds that they were a bulwark against terrorism.

Mr Miliband later told BBC2's Newsnight he was 'in favour of capitalism, just for the record, but it is what kind of capitalism you have.'

He said the New Labour model of using the proceeds of growth to invest in public services and tackle poverty had advantages and disadvantages.

'The disadvantages were that it didn't change the way the economy worked enough, it did not lower inequality, and, also, for the next 10 years, there isn't going to be that money around,' he said.

On the final day of the conference, deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman will accuse the Conservatives of plotting to wipe out millions of Labour's core votes by pushing people off the electoral register.

The conference will also hear today from some of the 3,000 workers who are set to lose their jobs at BAE Systems.
