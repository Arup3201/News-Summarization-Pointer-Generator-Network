When it comes to pushy parents, Chinese father He Liesheng took top prize after making his son jog in the snow aged just four, before teaching him to fly a plane aged five.

Now Liesheng has taken things a step further by taking son He Yide, now six, on a 1,800-mile mission across the desert in China in order to teach him survival skills.

Yide spent 11 days travelling across the deadly Lop desert, where temperatures regularly drop below freezing and can reach 50C (122F), with his father and two other young boys.

Yide was forced to walk 62 miles on foot by his father during their mission into the desert. They travelled the rest of the way in a motorcade, as much of the terrain is impassable

Yide and his father were joined by two other boys, aged 11 and 13, who were recruited online. During the trip they learned survival skills such as how to find food and water, and how to navigate using the stars

The experience included strength training, lessons in how to find water and how to catch food, and how to navigate by reading the stars at night.

One evening Liesheng even turfed the boys out of their sleeping bags and made them sleep in pits he dug in the ground. 

The expedition travelled most of the way in a motorcade, as the salt flats are covered in crystals  which can cut people as they walk, but Yide was still made to complete a 62-mile trek on foot.

Liesheng and his son were accompanied on their travels by 11-year-old Yin Kejie and  Lai Wenliag, 13, who were both recruited online.

The group traversed the Lop desert in five cars equipped with GPS equipment and medical supplies, but were otherwise left to fend for themselves.

They had to telephone for help once along the way after leaving the cars with no extra clothing, food or water, when the temperature suddenly dropped below freezing, leaving them stranded. 

At one point during the trip, Liesheng threw the three boys out of their sleeping bags in made them sleep in pits he had dug in the ground instead

Liesheng began training Yide at just ten days old after the boy was born prematurely, leading doctors to warn him that his son could suffer physical defects

Many professional explorers have died trying to cross the Lop desert, including Peng Jiamu. The group visited a shrine to him as part of their trip, and laid a bottle of water in remembrance (pictured) 

Many professional explorers have died attempting to cross the desert, including Peng Jiamu, a Chinese biochemist, who died there in 1980.

During their mission, Liesheng and his three companions stopped at a shrine to Jiamu, leaving behind bottles of water as a sign of remembrance.

Liesheng became notorious in 2012 after Yide was pictured running outside in New York during snow in nothing but his underpants

Liesheng, a businessman based in Nanjing, capital of eastern China's Jiangsu Province, became determined to toughen his son up after the boy was born prematurely, leading doctors to warn that he might suffer physical defects.

After Yide spent two months in hospital, Liesheng devised a tough training programme for him, including swimming lessons which began just 10 days after Yide came out of his incubator.

Dubbing himself the 'Eagle Father', Liesheng said: 'When the baby eagle is old enough, the mother eagle would harshly push its baby down the cliff. 

'When the baby eagle is plummeting, a survival instinct would make it flap its wings vigorously. Through this, the baby eagle acquires its basic survival skill - flying.

'I don't agree with the education of most of the parents. They are too protective and caring, which makes their kid lazy and with no pioneering spirit.'

Other challenges for Yide included eight hours of lessons a day from the age of six months, mountain climbing from two years old, and five miles of jogging every day.

Yide was also registered for classes including kung fu and kickboxing, while he took up skateboarding and bike riding of his own accord.

He attends the Experimental Primary School of Nanjing University of Science and Technology and his father says he always asks to take his son out of school before completing the challenges.

Liesheng said he made the education plan based on 7 years of teaching experience and more than 10 years' experience running a company.

His wife was forced to quit her job in order to help turn the plan into a reality.

Liesheng devised an 'eagle education' plan for his son, including swimming lessons from just 10 days outside the incubator, lessons from the age of six months, and mountain climbing from two years old

Liesheng dubbed himself the 'Eagle Father', saying mother eagles will push their chicks out of the nest in order to teach them to fly - a philosophy he adopted with his own son

Yide has never needed to visit hospital again after spending two months in an incubator after being born after just seven moths of pregnancy, according to his father 

Liesheng said: 'Yide is now in very good health. Besides the two months in hospital when he was born, he never visited a hospital again.'

The pair rose to public attention in 2012 after Yide was pictured running through the snow in New York in just his underwear, and doing press ups outside.

Last year Yide became the youngest person to fly solo in a plane, completing a 35-minute trip over Beijing, according to his father.

Liesheng apparently paid 30,000 yuan (£3,100) for private flying lessons for his son. The boy was accompanied by a professional pilot for safety reasons, but the man did not touch the controls.

The name 'Eagle Father' is taken from Amy Chua's book Battle Hymn Of The Tiger Mother, in which she argued that Chinese mothers were superior to American mothers because they pushed their children harder.
