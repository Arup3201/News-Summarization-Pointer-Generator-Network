Coming in at a whopping £17.5m, Furze Croft, in Weybridge, Surrey, is a new build in a classical design. It has eight bedrooms, a private cinema and an indoor pool

The main drawing room area comes off the entrance hall and is centred around a large fireplace and has French windows which open out into the garden

The master bedroom has its own private balcony, as well as twin walk-in dressing rooms and ensuite bathrooms. It is one of six bedroom suites

The beautiful mansion has two wings and nearly two acres of landscaped gardens. Its developers say it was designed to be a 'real family home'

Once you've made it through the grand gates and up the gravel driveway, complete with feature landscaped turning circle, you open the front door onto a huge double volume entrance hall, with a sweeping staircase and glass roof cupola.

From the entrance hall you can reach the 18-seater dining room, plush double drawing room and the kitchen and breakfast room, which open right out onto the flagstone paved terrace and back garden through French windows. 

Furze Croft has also been designed for entertaining on an extra large scale. One wing contains a large VIP entertaining suite consisting of a custom-made bar and drinks lounge. Folding glass doors can be opened to merge this space with the outside terrace,which creates a space big enough to entertain 200 guests - more than most people are used to on their average weekend.

The large, open entrance hall has a marble floor and opens out into the double drawing room, 18-seater dining room and kitchen and breakfast room

The bright entrance hall features a sweeping staircase and glass roof cupola, giving a suitably dramatic first impression of the house

The light-filled breakfast room is attached to the kitchen, has a breakfast bar and backs onto the huge expanse of gardens

There is an indoor swimming pool and hot tub for when it's time to relax, with space for loungers at pool-side and huge doors opening up to the garden

The house is located on East Road in St George's Hill estate, where former residents include Elton John, Tom Jones and a host of footballers including Frank Lampard and John Terry.

As well as the indoor swimming pool, complete with pool-side loungers, it boats a hot tub, while the bathrooms have super-deep baths and giant power showers.

Steve Glover, founding director of developers Consero London said: 'Despite its size, Furze Croft has been designed to be a real family home that pleases and impresses its occupants and visitors. We have carefully balanced its large entertaining rooms with cosy and intimate informal spaces where the family can relax and interact.  

Furze Croft has been designed for large-scale entertaining, with a reception area that can open up to hold more than 200 people 

The kitchen is fitted out with top-of-the-range modern appliances and has a built-in island area and kitchen table, as well as French windows

When you walk through the grand gates and the entrance hall you reach the 18-seater dining room, perfect for dinner parties

'The local housing market is lacking brand-new 21st century mansions of this quality and advanced specification. St George's Hill is one of the finest private estates outside of central London, making Furze Croft both a good turn-key investment as well an outstanding country retreat close to the capital.' 

The house took two years to build and is set over lower ground, ground and first floors. The developers are expecting interest from Russian and Middle Eastern millionaires. 

It has six bedroom suites, consisting of a master bedroom with a private terrace overlooking the gardens, twin walk-in dressing rooms and twin ensuite bathrooms. Four have walk-in dressing rooms and ensuites and the other also has an ensuite.  

The house's interior oozes wealth, and developers are hoping it gets snapped up by wealthy Russian or Middle Eastern buyers

There is an extra-large garage big enough for four limousines or large saloon cars, with access to the house via a side lobby

The massive walk-in dressing rooms mean you will never again have trouble digging out your favourite shirt

The top-of-the-range super-deep baths and power showers mean the spacious bathrooms are pure luxury

On the first floor of one wing there is also a two-bedroom staff apartment with self-contained kitchen and sitting room, which could alternatively serve as an annex.

The other wing houses the 11-metre long, 2.1-metre deep  pool, a gym, sauna and changing/toilet facilities. Folding glass doors in the pool room can be opened onto the garden, creating a large inside-outside leisure area. 

When you descend to the lower ground floor you find the private cinema, complete with customised wall panelling and tiered platform flooring just like the real thing. 

This floor also has a wine display suite with a glass-enclosed, temperature-controlled wine room capable of holding a whopping 1,700 bottles of fine wines and spirits.

The mansion has been built using some of the finest materials and craftsmen  from around the world.  Botticino Fiorito marble flooring has been used across the house, while the design theme is evident in every room. 

The wine cellar is big enough for an incredible 1,700 bottles, meaning this family home is not short of entertainment facilities

The house, off East Road on the prestigious St George's Hill estate, took two years to build. The trees and plants were specially imported from Tuscany

The garage can accommodate up to four limousines or large saloon cars, with direct access to the house via a side lobby, while the grounds feature trees and plants specially hand selected and imported from Tuscany. 

Robert Osborn, Founding Director of Consero London said: 'Furze Croft sets a new benchmark for quality and luxury in the St George's Hill housing market. It is defined by its exceptional quality; architectural integrity and fine attention to detail. The house has involved hundreds of man-hours and a team of skilled artisans providing the very best of British, French and Italian craftsmanship amongst various other countries. 

'Using centuries old techniques, stone carving, guilding, marquetry and cabinetry has been combined with state-of-the-art communications, entertainment and security technology. The result is an extremely special and unique residence of outstanding value.'

The exclusive St George's Hill estate is a celebrity-spotting hotspot. It has  golf and tennis clubs nearby, large water features and an abundance of manicured green spaces.
