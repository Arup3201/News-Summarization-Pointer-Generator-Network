Fathers are twice as likely as mothers to have requests for flexible working rejected by bosses, figures show.

Despite rules giving parents equal rights to ask for family-friendly hours, almost one in five men are rebuffed by employers.

Labour blamed ‘cultural barriers’ which mean firms still see looking after children as the responsibility of mothers, with men expected to work full-time.

Fathers are twice as likely as mothers to have requests for flexible working rejected

Figures released in Parliament show how men, people in their forties and northerners are more likely to have requests rejected.

It also reveals how men are much less likely to even bother asking their boss for to work flexibly.

In 2012, 18 per cent of men who asked for flexible working were turned down, compared to 10 per cent of women.

Labour shadow children's minister Lucy Powell said dads feel short-changed by employers

Only 17 per cent of fathers even ask to change their hours compared to 28 per cent of women.

It comes as a new report shows younger dads aged between 26 and 35 are the most resentful towards their employers about their work-life balance.

Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow children’s minister, said: ‘Childcare is not just an issue for mums.

‘These figures show that dads are getting a raw deal when trying to balance work and family.

‘Today, dads need a modern workplace and family-friendly policies and practices so they can get on at work as well as having time to be with their kids.’

The figures from the Department for Work and Pensions also reveal people are more likely to be turned down for flexible leave depending on their age or where they live.

People in their forties are most likely to be rejected (18 per cent) compared to 12 per cent for 16-39-year-olds and 11 per cent of over-50s.

People in the Midlands were least likely to be rebuffed (8 per cent) compared to 14 per cent in the south of England and 16 per cent in the north.

As the law stands parents with children aged 16 or under, those with disabled children under 18, and carers of adults have the right to apply for a flexible working pattern.

Miss Powell added: ‘While women still face a glass ceiling to get back and get on in work, many dads face other cultural barriers to being able to flexibly including working long hours, inflexible organisational culture and expectations that men should be the main breadwinner.

‘This generation of dads feels short-changed by employers and the system. We know having more dads involved in childcare and home life is good for children but this should benefit employers too, making their employees happier and less resentful. Policy and practice needs to change to give more opportunities to fathers.’

A BIS spokesman said: 'We are extending the right to request flexible working to all employees from this year.

'By allowing everyone to work flexibly, we want to remove the cultural assumption that flexible working is only for women, or just for parents and carers.

'We want these reforms to bring about a culture change in Britain's workplaces, allowing everyone to better balance work with their personal life through jobs shares, part-time working or working from home.

'The current system for maternity and paternity leave has not kept up with the times, so in 2015 we're introducing shared parental leave and pay, which will allow working couples to choose how they share care for their child in the first year after birth. It will allow men to play a more active role in childcare and family responsibilities, and women to return to work sooner if they wish to.'
