Celtic captain Scott Brown has insisted he has no reason to fear being banned for Sunday’s League Cup Final and called on critics of his Tannadice tackle on Nadir Ciftci to ‘man up’.

The Parkhead skipper, whose heavy challenge on the Dundee United striker sparked a melee during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final at the weekend, is one of a number of players who will find out on Tuesday if they face retrospective action from the SFA.

But, dismissing any concern, Brown said: ‘Am I worried about being cited? Not in the slightest. The referee was two yards away and he had a clear view of my tackle and he saw that I won the ball.

‘It was a great tackle. He was fine with it and so was the linesman. They saw what they saw and they made their decisions.

‘At the end of the day, it’s a man’s sport. People need to man up a bit. People moan about the tackles, but if the ball is there to be won, go and win it. As long as it’s not dangerous and you are not flying two-footed into somebody.’

In the wake of an absorbing 1-1 draw game that saw three red cards and two penalties, one of which was saved, the Tannadice club announced they are appealing the red card issued to midfielder Paul Paton.

The luckless Paton was the victim of mistaken identity by referee Craig Thomson, at the behest of assistant referee Graham Chambers, after his team-mate Calum Butcher clashed on the ground with Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk.

But while Paton’s appeal on Thursday is expected to be straightforward, Van Dijk faces a 48 hours cup final sweat after Celtic also appealed his red card.

And in what is shaping up as a disciplinary D-Day, United trio Cifti, Butcher and Aidan Connolly will join Brown in finding out by 3pm this afternoon whether they face retrospective disciplinary action from SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan.

Ciftci appeared to kick Brown in the face following the Celtic man’s heavy challenge, while Butcher could be hit with a red card for his role in the clash with van Dijk.

Connolly, meanwhile, could face a simulation charge after Celtic boss Ronny Deila accused him of diving to win his team’s first half penalty kick, scored by Ciftci. Paul Dixon was the other sending off during Sunday’s match but United won’t contest that and he misses the Scottish Cup replay at Parkhead on March 18. 

After the cup match, United boss Jackie McNamara said much of the trouble could have been avoided if referee Craig Thomson had sent off Brown for his initial challenge on Ciftci.

The referee did not even give a foul but the Celtic captain – who called for video evidence to be introduced to help the under-fire match officials – added: ‘I was kicked in the head (by Ciftci). You can blatantly see that. We will see what happens with that. At the time I didn’t know who it was. I felt a boot against my face.

‘There was so much going on at the time, I didn’t know who it was until I watched it again afterwards.

‘I’m probably lucky it was to my face, and not another part of my body.

In a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton

‘Do I hope Virgil wins his appeal? That would be great but we will see. But I didn’t see that incident because I had (Ciftci’s) studs in my face at the time. You could see the marks, you still can.’

Brown, who was speaking at Lesser Hampden where he was publicising Sunday’s showpiece occasion, also backed up his boss Deila’s assertion that Connolly had been guilty of simulation to win a penalty.

‘It was a blatant dive,’ said Brown. ‘I was close by. Anthony (Stokes) put his leg in but you can see that he has pulled his leg away before the lad has gone down.

‘He played it really well. I will give him that but we had (Derk Boerrigter) get a two-match ban for that so I think it was dealt with rightly. You don’t want to see people cheating whether it helps you or not. It is not a nice part of the game.’

Brown refused to be critical of match officials Thomson and Chambers, and instead insisted video evidence would have cleared up the confusion.

‘I think yesterday would have been ideal for it,’ he said. ‘We stopped the game for four or five minutes and it was the wrong decision that Paton got sent off.

‘If we had watched that back we would have clearly seen who it was.

‘It wouldn’t stop the game every two minutes, (only with) big decisions like that. We definitely need that.’
