A five-year-old girl is in the hospital in a medically-induced coma after being hit by a stray bullet while on her way home from a baby shower in the Bronx early Sunday.

Hailey Dominguez was shot just outside her family's apartment around 1 a.m., according to police.

The bullet pierced her lung.

Stable: Hailey Dominguez is in stable condition after being hit in the lung by a stray bullet coming home from a family friend's baby shower

'It passed through her stomach - thank God it missed her spine,' Edwin Roman, 23, told the New York Daily News.

Roman is the boyfriend of Hailey's mother, Gloria Miranda.

Hailey, her mother, and brother, had just gotten out of a cab when the shots went off.

An unidentified family member told reporters that Hailey was almost to the door of the family's fifth-floor walk-up when a group of men appeared around the corner with guns drawn.

'We were crying, not her,' said her sister, Keyla, 15. 'She’s a very brave person.'

She had been dancing at the family friend's baby shower and was still wearing her party dress.

'She likes to dance,' Roman said. 'She's a little ballerina.'

Random: Police do not believe the girl's family was a target

'I heard two shots and I stayed inside, I didn't see who did the shooting,' neighbor Jose Gonzalez said.

Neighbor Carmen Rosario told the New York Post she called 911 when she heard the shots.

When she opened her door she saw the little girl clutching herself.

'She
wasn't crying,' she said. 'I sat next to her for a few minutes and 
right away the officers came. The officers opened her coat and they saw 
blood and they took off.'

She was immediately rushed to St. 
Barnabas Hospital, then transferred to Morgan Stanley Children's 
Hospital in Washington Heights where her condition is listed as stable.

She is still fighting a fever, and has been placed in a medically-induced coma.

'I don't know why this happened,' said her father, Jonathan Dominguez. 'She's going to be okay, thank God.'

Hailey's family was not the intended target.

Police are investigating but no arrests have been made.
