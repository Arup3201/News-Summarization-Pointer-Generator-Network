A review into sexual abuse inside Australia's Nauru detention centre has found evidence of rape, sexual assault and guards trading marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees.

The independent review by former integrity commissioner Philip Moss was released on Friday and has uncovered several dozen cases with guards possibly trading drugs for 'sexual favours' on the Pacific island nation.

The 86-page report detailed allegations of indecent and physical assault, as well as sexual harassment, at the offshore processing centre.

A review into sexual abuse inside Australia's Nauru detention centre (pictured) has found evidence of rape, sexual assault and guards trading marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees

The report states that one detainee, who was a mother of two, had asked for a longer shower to which a 'male security guard' agreed, under the condition that the could 'watch a girl or a boy having a shower.' 

Detainees had previously complained that two minute showers were not long enough and had requested four minute showers instead. 

However when one woman asked if she could turn the water back on to wash shampoo out of her eyes, it's alleged in the review that a male guard said he would give her more time, if she showed him her naked body. 

The review also states that they have been made aware of two specific allegations of rape at the centre

One rape happened in a woman's tent. She subsequently asked for the incident to be kept quiet for fear of retaliation from other detainees.  She then changed her mind and asked for police to investigate. 

The report states that the Nauruan Government then granted refugee status to the alleged perpetrator and he is now settled in the Nuaruan community. 

The second female detainee reported that she had been raped by a 'contract service provider staff member'. She also did not report the incident due to cultural and religious reasons. 

In another instance, a female detainee told the review that a guard had allegedly offered to give her friend chewing gum and a lollipop if she allowed him to see her naked.

On another occasion two female detainees recounted a time when a driver and his assistant turned the vehicle's headlights off and propositioned the women with an offer of cigarettes and chewing gum. 

One transferee told the review that women in the camp could offer sexual favours in return for marijuana. 

'Because they (the transferees) are suffering great depression here, and they feel relieved when they smoke the marijuana, the officers have made them addicted for their own reasons,' the detainee said. 

'Because the women do not get paid here, so what they need to obtain,they only have to offer sexual - fulfil the requests of the men.' 

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the content of a review into allegations of abuse against asylum seekers on Nauru is 'very concerning

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the content of a review into allegations of abuse against asylum seekers on Nauru is 'very concerning'. 

Mr Cormann would not be drawn on whether more media access should be allowed on the island in the wake of the report, but said he was concerned by its findings.

'Some of the content in the report ... is very concerning,' he told Sky News on Saturday.

'The department has accepted all of the recommendations and all of the recommendations will be implemented.

'Beyond that I'll leave it to the Minister for Immigration to respond to these sorts of inquiries.'

The review was ordered by former immigration minister Scott Morrison following claims children had been abused while in detention.

The department says it has accepted 19 recommendations from the review and has begun work on implementing them in cooperation with the Nauru government, service providers and the Australian Federal Police. 

However, Labor have criticised the Federal Government over its initial response to the report after Tony Abbott said these institutions 'aren't perfect.'

The ABC have reported that when Mr Abbott was asked about his response to the report he nonchalantly responded saying that 'occasionally, I dare say, things happen.' 

 Labor's Immigration spokesperson Richard Marles called the Federal Government's response a 'disgrace' and believes Mr Abbott needs to take responsibility and think before he speaks.

Labor had changed it's tune by the afternoon with Mr Abbott assuring that the Government were assuming the 19 recommendations outlined in the review, calling the findings 'very disturbing.'
