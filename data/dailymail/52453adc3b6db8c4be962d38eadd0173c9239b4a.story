Takeaways are selling lamb dishes containing unidentified meats, raising fears that flesh from rats, dogs and cats could be in our curries and kebabs.

Investigators have been analysing fast food all over Britain and found that lamb had routinely been replaced with pork, beef, chicken, turkey and what could be vermin or pets, it was revealed today.

The studies – one by the Food Standards 
Agency and another by consumer group Which? – come more than a year 
after the supermarket horsemeat scandal and suggest food fraud is still 
rife on the high street.

The Which? analysis of 60 lamb dishes found 29 were 'suspect', 17 contained different meats, seven contained no lamb at all and five had meat that could not be identified.

Some takeaways are routinely selling 'lamb' curries containing no lamb, according to two major studies

British favourite: The kebab is a takeaway staple in the UK, but analysis has found that some contained unidentified meats

Lamb dishes are particularly vulnerable to fraud because the meat is expensive, meaning takeaways might replace it with poor quality, cheaper cuts of beef, chicken and turkey.

The FSA, which is responsible for food hygiene and safety in the UK, looked at council surveys of 145 lamb takeaway meals sold across the country between July and December last year.

Of these 43 (30 per cent) contained other types of meat, such as beef and chicken, as well as lamb, or no lamb at all. Almost one in five meals contained only beef.

The separate Which? research tested 30 takeaway lamb curries and 30 minced lamb kebabs from restaurants in Birmingham and London. It found 24 dishes (40 per cent) had a mixture of meats or no lamb. Seven, or more than one in ten, contained only beef.

In five of the dishes sampled, the meat could not be identified

Most worryingly, the meat in five of the samples could not be identified. One explanation is that it was overcooked or re-cooked, but there is a possibility it was from an animal that is not normally eaten in the UK.

The findings will be especially upsetting to many families of Hindu or Sikh faith, who do not eat beef for religious reasons.

Professor Chris Elliott, director of the Institute for Global Food Security who was appointed by the Government to come up with a series of recommendations to tackle food fraud in response to the horsemeat scandal, said: ‘The survey results come as no great surprise to me. Whenever issues about food contamination and adulteration are looked for in a serious way they are found.

‘Without rigorous monitoring programmes in place cheats will always try to take advantage of consumers.We need to develop systems in the UK that deter fraud.’

Andrew Rhodes, the FSA’s chief operating officer, insisted the watchdog is taking action to crack down on food fraud.

In response to the findings, the FSA has threatened the businesses involved with fines of up to £5,000. It has also asked local councils to launch a major sampling programme of lamb dishes across 300 takeaways to bring about prosecutions of rogue traders.

Mr Rhodes said: ‘The recurring nature of the problem shows there needs to be a renewed effort to tackle it. The testing we have announced today will focus the efforts of enforcement officers and raise awareness among food businesses of the action they face for defrauding consumers.’
