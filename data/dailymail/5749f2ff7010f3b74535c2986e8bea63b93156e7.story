Richard Jeferies shed the weight in a
 little over 12 months

Dropped from more than 24 
stone to a much healthier 16st 9lbs

Says getting stuck on rollercoaster and being called 'fat man' by child in shop was the push he needed

A man has lost almost 8 stone in just a year after being so large that he got stuck in a theme park ride.

Richard Jeferies from Street, Sheerness was shamed into losing more than seven stone after almost getting stuck in a theme park ride and having a child point him out as a 'fat man'.

Richard, 48, tipped 
the scales at 24 stone but only realised he had a problem after getting 
wedged in 'Sonic Spinball' at Alton Towers.

Richard was shamed into losing more than seven stone after almost getting stuck in a theme park ride and having a child point him out as a 'fat man'

The father-of-four was at the theme park with his daughter Isabella, 8. when he struggled to fit into the ride.

Staff had to stamp on the bar to make it lock around Richard which meant he struggled to breathe.

And when the carriage finally came to a stop overweight Richard was left wedged in the seat and had to be heaved out by staff.

He says he was spurred on by the embarrassing experience and immediately
 launched a fitness regime of eating salads and hitting the gym.

In just over a year he has shed 7st 13lbs and now weighs a much healthier 16st 9lbs.

Richard, from Sheerness, Kent, said: 'When we sat in the car the attendant
 could not get the bar to go down so he was stamping on it.

'I had to decide whether it was more embarrassing to get off or wait while they tried to stamp it on.

'I could barely breathe. It was spinning round and I thought 'they are going to be taking a corpse off this'.

'I swore I would never go on a ride again. It was those little triggers that made me realise.'

Richard, a theatre volunteer, said on another occasion he was mortified 
when he heard a little girl in a supermarket car park point at him and 
say: 'look mummy, a fat man'.

He said: 'When I heard the little girl say I was fat I was really hurt. I was too upset to turn round so I just kept walking.

'If someone had said to me I would be eating salad for lunch and going 
to the gym three times a week I would never have believed them.

'It's given me a whole new lease of life - I can run and keep up with my children.'

Richard, who lives with his wife Fiona, 45, a full-time mother and their four 
children, had considered weight-loss surgery in the past.

But he joined Weight Watchers and after dramatically changing his diet and exercising, the weight started to drop off.
