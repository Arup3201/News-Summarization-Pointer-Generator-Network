Is he the most honest CEO or the naivest one?

Elon Musk freely admits Tesla Motors is overvalued because investors 'often get carried away' with his company.

'I think our stock price is kind of high right now, to be totally honestly,' Musk told CNBC on Thursday. 

Tesla stock fell more than 3 percent just a day after the remarks. closing at $277.

Yet Musk 
hardly has a reason to be concerned: the company's price has skyrocketed nearly 17 times from its initial public offering price in 2010.

Just this year, shares have increased by a whopping 90 percent, according to CNBC.

Musk says investors should be in it for the long run.

'If you care about the long-term, Tesla, I think the stock is a good price,' he told CNBC. 'If you look at the short term, it is less clear.'

Musk made the remarks to CNBC on Thursday as he announced that Nevada was the location chosen for Tesla's gigantic lithium-ion battery plant, which is expected to bring down the cost of Tesla Model 3 by $2,800.

The $5 billion facility, called the 'gigafactory,' is expected to bring 6,500 jobs to the state and $100 billion in economic benefits, according to CNBC. In return, the state offered Tesla up to $1.3 billion in tax breaks.

Also vying for the plant had been Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.

'The
 biggest single factor was time to completion, because unless the 
gigafactory is ready when we need to produce the mass-market affordable 
electric car, the vehicle factory will be stalled — so time to execution
 was extremely important,' Musk told CNBC.

'Nevada was in the lead, I would say number one, in time to execution.'

The factory is expected to open by 2017.

How
 it will work: The 'gigafactory,' as Tesla calls the project, would 
bring the cost of batteries down by producing them on a huge scale. Its 
approximately 10 million square feet, equivalent to about 174 football 
fields, would be running by 2017. Batteries will be produced at the 
site, then shipped to Fremont, where the cars are assembled
