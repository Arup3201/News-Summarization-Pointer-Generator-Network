Charged: PC Hannah Notley outside Westminster Magistrates' Court where she was accused of failing to properly investigate a rape allegation

A police officer did not properly investigate a rape allegation and then told the victim the CPS had dropped the case, a court heard.

PC Hannah Notley, 30, a specialist trained in handling cases involving sexual offences, committed a ‘gross breach of trust,’ Westminster Magistrates Court heard.

She gave false information to her bosses about the case being shelved when in fact she had not submitted the papers to the CPS.

She allegedly failed to properly investigate the rape allegation between July 2011 and February last year while based at Rayleigh Police Station in Essex.

Notley, who is charged with misconduct in a public office, spoke only to confirm her name and address.

Releasing Notley on unconditional bail, District Judge Nicholas Evans said: ‘I send this case to Southwark Crown Court.

‘I remand you on unconditional bail with an obligation to attend that court at 10am on November 8.

‘You need to understand that you have a duty to turn up - if you don’t that is a separate offence.

‘Equally, you will be asked on your arrival at the Crown Court if you wish to plead guilty or not guilty.

‘If you plead guilty, the judge will give you a discounted sentence but if you plead not guilty, and the jury convicts you, then you will not be given a discount.’

Notley, from Benfleet, Essex, has yet to enter a plea to the charge.

Hearing: Notley, who is charged with misconduct in a public office, spoke only to confirm her name and address at the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court
