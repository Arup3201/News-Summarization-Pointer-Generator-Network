Pressure on family doctors to diagnose more patients with dementia could do substantial harm, a leading GP has warned.

They may be ‘leaned on’ to overdiagnose and ‘get the numbers up’ because there are ‘vested interests’ that stand to gain, Dr Martin Brunet said.

But this raises concerns the patient-doctor relationship is being undermined, he warned.

Getting the numbers up: League tables for dementia diagnosis could encourage some doctors to overdiagnose, a leading GP has warned in the British Medical Journal (photo posed by models)

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has prioritised increasing dementia diagnosis rates in those patients who don’t have obvious symptoms. He believes GPs are reluctant to carry out tests because there is no effective cure.

But this has raised fears that unnecessary diagnoses will be made for fear of losing funding.

Mr Hunt has endorsed new  targets for diagnosis rates of Alzheimer’s and other forms of the disease. In November, he published a ‘dementia map’ of rates for different clinical commissioning groups (CCG).

But Dr Brunet said the video accompanying the website features Mr Hunt ‘lambasting the laggards for poor performance’.

As a result CCGs are piling on the pressure on GPs to raise dementia diagnosis rates ‘with financial strings attached’, while ‘leaning on you heavily to make any diagnosis to get the numbers up’, he claimed. At least one CCG has told its GPs the area will lose money if they don’t increase rates, Dr Brunet added.

And he warned that ‘naming and shaming’ makes the worst performers desperate to get off the bottom of the league table and so may unnecessarily ‘upgrade’ the diagnosis to dementia.

Dr Brunet, from Binscombe Medical Centre in Godalming, Surrey, is among growing medical opposition to the strategy. He said there was deep concern that the patient-doctor relationship was being undermined.

The setting of target rates for the diagnosis of any condition is unprecedented, says Dr Brunet, in a personal view in the British Medical Journal.

He said: ‘Dementia is big business and there are many vested interests that stand to benefit from a rise in the number of diagnoses.’

One in three older people has some form of minor cognitive impairment, which can be picked up in tests but may never lead to full-blown dementia.

Meanwhile, figures used to estimate how many diagnoses each practice should make are often wrong and fail to take into account local circumstances, such as dementia care homes in the area, Dr Brunet added.

And he warned: ‘Working towards targets can lead to perverse behaviours and outcomes, because the needs of patients are secondary to the requirement to fulfil quotas.’

The UK National Screening Committee said in June 2010 that screening for Alzheimer’s Disease ‘should not be offered’ because there was insufficient evidence of the benefits.

CCGs, which comprise groups of GPs collectively responsible for commissioning local services, can attract a quality premium payment as a reward for improving a range services.

Hertfordshire CCG has chosen the dementia rate target as one of the qualifying measures. If they miss it they will lose out on extra money for the area.

Dr Brunet said: ‘The idea that doctors should be motivated by self interest, such as personal or corporate gain, is abhorrent.’

The Health Department said in 2011 there were 250,000 dementia patients registered by GPs. It now exceeds 300,000.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘A timely diagnosis can make a significant difference to a person’s quality of life.

'We would always expect doctors to act in the best interests of their patients, to assess them appropriately when they show the signs of dementia, and refer them to a specialist for diagnosis.’
