The last thing Liverpool need when Luis Suarez goes is a repeat of Tottenham’s post-Gareth Bale trauma.

Spurs raked in a world-record £86million for Bale a year ago and then wasted it on seven underwhelming signings, like £25m flop Erik Lamela.

To avoid the same pitfalls, Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers has already done his homework and made plans to rebuild a Liverpool team that can challenge in the Premier League and Champions League.

Poitning the way: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has already been very busy in the market this summer

Heading for the exit: Last season's star man Luis Suarez is set to join Barcelona

Southampton’s England World Cup players Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert have already arrived. So has 20-year-old defensive midfield player Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen.

Even bigger fish are set to follow. Benfica winger Lazar Markovic is due for a medical on Thursday before completing his £20million move from Portugal.

Belgium’s World Cup striker Divock Origi is in advance talks. A left back, possibly Swansea City’s Ben Davies, is needed. Dejan Lovren wants to join from Southampton.

The average age of the new squad will be among the youngest in the Premier League which perfectly fits the profile demanded by owner John W Henry.

There will be some familiar faces. Steven Gerrard will continue as captain albeit Rodgers will not play him every week so he lasts the season. Lucas, Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson will have parts to play.

But overall as the washing powder commercials go, this Liverpool will be new and improved – even without Barcelona-bound Suarez. At least that is what Rodgers is counting on.

‘NEW AND IMPROVED’... HOW LIVERPOOL COULD LINE UP 2014-15

GOALKEEPER – SIMON MIGNOLET

Made an immediate impact at Anfield last season with a match-winning penalty save on his debut against Stoke City. Now 26, he should be coming into his prime as a goalkeeper.

RIGHT BACK – JON FLANAGAN

Just 21, local boy Flanagan has filled in across the defence to help the team but this could be his breakthrough season in his favoured position with Glen Johnson showing the first signs of decline.

CENTRE BACK – DEJAN LOVREN

The Croatian World Cup defender has made it no secret he’d like to join the Rodgers revolution at Anfield from Southampton. But a fee still has to be agreed with the St Mary’s club.

Shoring up: Southampton's Dejan Lovren was one of the outstanding defenders in the top flight last season

CENTRE BACK – MAMADOU SAKHO

Uncomfortable first season but excelled in the World Cup for France – where he was picked ahead of Arsenal’s Laurent Koscielny – and now ready to show The Kop what £17m was spent on.

LEFT BACK – BEN DAVIES

Rodgers has been searching for a left back ever since he arrived at the club. Liverpool have been linked with plenty but £6m Davies would be right up their street if Swansea sell.

CENTRAL MIDFIELD – EMRE CAN

The German has just signed in a £10m deal from Bayer Levekusen and doesn’t lack confidence – agreeing to wear the No 23 shirt made famous by Jamie Carragher. Just 20, he is improving each year.

Yes we Can: Liverpool have already signed Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen for £10m this summer

CENTRAL MIDFIELD – STEVE GERRARD/PHILIPPE COUTINHO

Rodgers knows Gerrard can’t play every week as he did last season, particularly with the club also back in Europe. When he wants to go for it, the excellent Coutinho can provide genuine trickery, with Can dropping back in to Gerrard's deeper role.

CENTRAL MIDFIELD – ADAM LALLANA

Liverpool’s most expensive signing of the summer so far at around £25m, Lallana’s ability to keep the ball moving and pick a pass means he will be essential to Rodgers’ plans.

RIGHT WING – RAHEEM STERLING

One of the few England players to return from the World Cup in credit. Hard to believe he’s still only 19, the ultimate modern forward with pace, technique and courage on and off the ball.

Sterling work: The England winger was a standout performer for the Reds last season

CENTRE FORWARD – DANIEL STURRIDGE

35 goals in 49 games for Liverpool is an astonishing return for a player who didn’t make it at Manchester City or Chelsea. Sturridge will be desperate to show he can score goals without Suarez.

LEFT WING - LAZAR MARKOVIC

The 20-year-old Serbian is rated one of the best young talents in Europe and Rodgers hopes his signing from Benfica will give Liverpool a genuine threat down both flanks.

SUBSTITUTES

MICHEL VORM – Rodgers wants cover for Mignolet in goal and Swansea’s Dutchman Vorm is his No 1 target.

GLEN JOHNSON – Not the force he once was but in a youthful squad, Johnson’s experience will be vital in Europe.

MARTN SKRTEL - Found it hard to adapt to the passing style being imposed by Rodgers, but he decided to stay at Anfield and was one of their most consistent performers last season.

JOE ALLEN – Rodgers’ first signing, for £15m from Swansea, the Welshman is among the most accurate passers in the Premier League and a growing influence on the pitch.

Case for the defence: Johnson (left) and Skrtel (right) will still have a role to play next season

JORDAN HENDERSON – One of few Kenny Dalglish signings to survive and thrive under Rodgers. Possesses a fantastic midfield engine and is versatile.

RICKIE LAMBERT – The Liverpudlian had a roundabout route to Anfield via Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton but he’s happy to be back ‘home’ after a £4m summer move from Southampton.

DIVOCK ORIGI – One of the new stars to emerge from the World Cup, Origi’s pace and trickery make him a natural replacement for Sturridge if the England man ever needs a rest.

Options: Origi (left) and Lambert (right) would allow Rodgers to mix it up up front
