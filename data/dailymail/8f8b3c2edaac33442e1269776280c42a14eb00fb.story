A professor helping to identify 600 body parts belonging to the Germanwings crash victims said today he would be haunted forever by the grim task.

Remains of the 150 passengers and crew are being categorised after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the Airbus A320 into the French Alps.

And Germany's most prestigious forensic scientist Michael Tsokos spoke of the work ahead as it emerged Lubitz's remains have already been found.

Investigators at the crash site have so far retrieved about 600 body parts and have managed to isolate 78 distinct DNA strands from the remains.

Some 50 bodies were identifiable visually, while many body parts were the size of a postage stamp - with the largest being the size of a suitcase.

Michael Tsokos, Germany's most prestigious forensic scientist, said he will be haunted forever by the grim task of identifying the body parts of those killed when the plane crashed into the mountainside in the Alps. He said: 'These images will never go out of my head'

Professor Tsokos admitted that killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's remains were among those which had been found at the wreckage site and said DNA testing had confirmed the body parts were his. It is hoped his remains may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving

Investigators continue to search for remains at the site while scientists have started the grim and gruelling task of identifying the body parts. Forensic experts are photographing and 3D scanning each and every body part before placing them in a morgue until ID is fully confirmed

Forensic experts confirmed they have found the remains of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured), who deliberately flew the Germanwings Airbus A320 into the mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday. He was said to have been suffering from a 'severe psychosomatic disorder'

Mr Tsokos admitted that Lubitz's remains were among those which had been found and said DNA testing had confirmed the body parts were his.

It is hoped his remains may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving.

Scientists are now continuing the gruelling task of identifying the rest of the remains which involves photographing and 3D scanning every body part.

Police have asked victims' friends and relatives for DNA samples, and experts hope to match them against the remains and material objects at the site.

Items with vital traces of DNA, such as toothbrushes, razors, jewellery and hair have been collected at the scene and given to scientists in Barcelona.

Forensic officers have also been testing samples at a mobile laboratory in Seyne-les-Alpes - the nearest town to the crash site. 

It is hoped the findings will provide some clues which will help identify the victims. Some 15 teams of two people - a forensics expert and a mountain rescue expert - are working at the crash zone. 

Psychologists are in Seyne, from where the helicopter takes off, to support the rescue workers. Wreckage is not being removed at this stage unless it is essential for analysis.

Families are also being asked if they can remember what clothes their loved ones were wearing when they boarded the ill-fated flight, in the hope the details could help with the identification process.

They have also been asked about any distinctive marks, such as tattoos, their loves ones might have as well as their dental status and whether they wore dentures.

Mr Tsokos, director of the Institute of legal medicine and forensic sciences, said it is hoped such findings will help identify the remains which will then be cross-examined with the flight's passenger list.

He said each body part would be photographed and scanned in 3D before being placed in a morgue. Once the body has been identified it will be placed in a closed coffin ready for a funeral.

He told German newspaper Bild: 'Radiologists with mobile devices will take CT images of body parts, so as to recognise for example, medically-implanted foreign bodies such as a pacemaker or artificial hip joints.

'Specially trained forensic scientists take [samples] of fingers and palms fingerprints and everything is photographed. Every little piece of fabric will be tested on the DNA so that it can be assigned to a particular person.'

He said that within the next three weeks, up to 95 per cent of all victims should be identified. But, he added that it was a haunting task for experts, saying: 'These images will never go out of my head.'

And he said the bodies will strictly be kept in closed coffins because the 'sight of battered corpses can inflict on anyone'.

The recovery of body parts must be completed by April 8, otherwise decomposition will make DNA identification impossible. Meanwhile, a second black box is still missing following the crash.

It comes as guards continue to keep 24-hour watch at the crash site, with teams sleeping on the mountainside overnight.  The guards have been on standby at the scene in the province in the southern French Alps since the flight crashed on Tuesday. 

Rescue recovery teams have been removing body parts from the scene and teams of French guards have been keeping 24-hour watch at the crash site (pictured). Philippe Thomy, deputy chief of the High Mountain Gendarmerie, said: 'We sleep next to a cemetery for 150 people'

Philippe Thomy, deputy chief of the High Mountain Gendarmerie, said: 'We sleep next to a cemetery for 150 people.'

Prosecutor Brice Robin revealed today that an access road was currently being built for all-terrain vehicles to reach the site to help with the removal of large parts of the plane. 

Mr Robin said the operation could be completed by Monday night, with all body parts and remains being removed from the site within the next week.

He also announced that a track for off-road vehicles would be established to the crash-site by tomorrow, for the removal of larger debris.

Yesterday, it emerged that Lubitz was suffering vision problems prior to the crash and had sought medical help in the weeks leading up to the disaster. 

The 27-year-old was suffering a 'serious psychosomatic disorder', according to police, and had sick-notes signing him off work for the day of the crash.

German investigators removed dozens of boxes from the Dusseldorf apartment Lubitz shared with his girlfriend, before later revealing they had found sick-notes signing him off work the day of the air crash. Officers are also said to have found a 'small mountain' of medication at the flat

Police also found a 'small mountain of drugs' used to treat mental illness at his Germany flat and Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed he had been a patient there over the past two months.

It adds to the belief that Lubitz deliberately downed the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 because he was severely depressed and feared his pilot's licence may be taken away from him over medical concerns.

However, Lubitz – who had notched up more than 600 flying hours - had been deemed '100 per cent' fit to fly after passing regular medical tests.

Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said all pilots undergo annual medical checks, but not special psychiatric assessments beyond training.

He added: 'He passed all medical exams, all checks. He was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions.'

A spokesman for Germanwings told MailOnline that under German employment law it was the responsibility of an employee to inform an employer if they were deemed unfit to work and stressed that it was unaware of any medical notes from Lubitz.
