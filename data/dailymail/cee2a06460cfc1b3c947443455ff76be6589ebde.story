Horrifying: Court documents have revealed that a doctor burst Clayton Lockett's artery during his execution at Oklahoma state prison

A report into the botched execution of Clayton Lockett has revealed new grisly details of the moments leading up to his agonizing death.

According to the document, a doctor tried to insert an intravenous line into his groin in a frantic attempt to save him, but hit and burst an artery instead.

It caused blood to splatter over the doctor's jacket before the execution was officially stopped. Lockett's heart stopped beating moments later.

In the report, Oklahoma state prison warden Anita Trammell is quoted as saying that the procedure was a 'bloody mess'. 

The damning brief, obtained byThe New York Times, was filed in a court on Friday in a bid to stop four executions in the state at the beginning of next year.

It also sheds light on the lack of training those officiating the execution received, including a paramedic who tried a number of times to put a catheter in place.

The line into  Lockett was not properly monitored during his April 29 execution meaning the three drugs were administered locally rather than spread throughout his system.

This caused him to writhe and groan in agony. 

It was then that the doctor tried to insert a new line into his groin, but he hit an artery, causing blood to fly everywhere. 

The medic told investigators, according to the report, that it was 'kind of marginal' because the needle was shorter than those normally used to reach the femoral artery.

Pitfalls: The damning report sheds light on the lack of training those officiating the execution received, including a paramedic who tried a number of times to put a catheter in place.

His reaction led to Governor Mary Fallin halting all upcoming lethal injections in the state until the completion of the review.

No One Knew: Anita Trammell, Oklahoma State Penitentiary warden, told investigators that executioners knew nothing about the drug midazolam

Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton had previously said the inmate died from a heart attack several minutes after he ordered the execution stopped. No attempts were made to resuscitate him.

But the autopsy report performed for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said all three execution drugs were found throughout Lockett's system.

A medical examiner declared that the cause of death was 'judicial execution by lethal injection.'

The investigation concluded the viability of the IV access point was the single greatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in administering the execution drugs,' according to the DPS report. The agency's commissioner was appointed by Fallin. 

Oklahoma put executions on hold after Lockett gasped and writhed against his restraints for several minutes after his April execution began.

The state used the sedative midazolam for the first time in Lockett's execution. That drug was also used in lengthy attempts to execute an Ohio inmate in January and an Arizona prisoner last month.

Each time, witnesses said the inmates appeared to gasp after their executions began and continued to labor for air before being pronounced dead. 

Lockett, 38, had been convicted of shooting Stephanie Nieman, 19, with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in 1999. 

Lockett slipped in and out of consciousness during the botched execution that even caught President Barack Obama's attention and died shortly after officials called off the execution, realizing that something went wrong.

Drugs: A mix of experimental drugs were used in the lengthy three-drug execution including midazolam

The day of Lockett's execution, he was reportedly tased when he resisted officials who tried to escort him from his cell to the execution chamber.

Documents obtained by the Times state that Lockett was treated for 'self-inflicted' injuries. The inmate refused food and refused to meet with his attorney hours before his execution.

Six months after Lockett's death, his brother Gary filed a lawsuit against the penitentiary for the botched execution saying that, with the use of the new drug midazolam, his brother was 'cast in the unwitting role of human lab rat.'

The lawsuit, obtained by KFOR , states that Lockett spoke numerous times during the painful ordeal and tried to rise from the execution table as he said that something was wrong.

The Daily News reports that midazolam had been chosen only month's before Lockett's execution.

Trammel reportedly told investigators that 'executioners didn't know anything about (midazolam). No one did.'

The Times reports that Lockett's grisly execution came after Oklahoma execution secrecy laws drew criticism and the execution prompted discussion about lethal drug reliability and alternatively used drug combinations.

Since Lockett's execution, the state's protocols have been rewritten to include more training and supply better equipment to the execution team and the amount of midazolam used during lethal injection has been increased by five times, according to the Daily News.
