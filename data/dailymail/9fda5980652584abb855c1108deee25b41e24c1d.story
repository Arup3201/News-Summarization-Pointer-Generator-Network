Prince Harry joked tonight that he hoped his brother knew 'how expensive my babysitting charges are' and also vowed to teach his nephew to have fun.

Whether his offer was a promise or a threat, given his most recent antics in Las Vegas, remains to be seen.

But the 28-year-old helicopter pilot was clearly already besotted with his new nephew Prince George.

Uncle Harry: Prince Harry arrives at a private viewing of a photographic exhibition at The Getty Gallery, London, where he described meeting his new nephew Prince George for the first time

Prince Harry spoke at the launch of an exhibition by photographer Chris Jackson highlighting the work of his charity Sentebale, which works with children infected with HIV in Lesotho, one of Africa's poorest countries

The prince went to see the new family 
addition at Kensington Palace shortly after his brother and sister in 
law returned from hospital on Tuesday night.

As he spoke tonight he gestured with his hands and described George as being 'about this long and that wide'.

'When I saw him he was crying, which is just like all babies,' he said.

'It's fantastic to have another addition to the family.

'I only hope my brother knows how expensive my baby sitting charges are!'

Good deeds: Britain's Prince Harry answers

Britain's Prince Harry and photographer Chris 
Jackson, right, view the photographs: Sentebale works to help children in 
Lesotho, a poverty-stricken African kingdom badly affected by the HIV 
and Aids pandemic

Important cause: Lesotho has the third highest 
HIV/Aids rate in the world, despite being one of the smallest kingdoms. 
Almost one in four of the country's population are infected by the 
disease

Joint effort: The Sentebale charity was founded 
by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, and aims to help 
vulnerable children who are the victims of poverty and Lesotho's 
HIV/AIDS epidemic

Prince Harry cracks a joke about the heat as he 
makes his speech: He also joked that he hoped his brother knew 'how 
expensive my babysitting charges are' and said he wanted to teach his 
nephew how to have fun

Harry speaks at the private view: The free exhibition runs at the London Getty Images Gallery from July 26

Asked who he most resembled, Harry said the baby was just four days old so it was too early to say.

But asked what kind of uncle he wanted
 to be, he said sweetly: 'to make sure he has a good upbringing and to 
keep him out of harm's way and make sure he has fun.

'The rest of it I'll leave to the parents.'

Asked if his brother's apparent 
confidence with the baby car seat outside hospital on Tuesday indicated 
he was cut out to be a good father, he replied loyally: 'Of course he 
is!'

He also admitted to having had a lovely cuddle with the tiny baby boy.

Among the guests at the private view 
was David Furnish, whose partner Elton John has helped raise money for a
 new Sentebale children’s centre through the Elton John Aids 
Foundation’s White Tie and Tiara ball.

Mr Furnish said: 'I congratulated him on being an uncle and he smiled proudly. I’m an uncle many times over and I love it.'

Elton John is currently in the South of France, recovering from a bout of appendicitis before surgery to remove his appendix.

Mr Furnish said of Sentebale: 'At our
 ball we gave people the chance to purchase cabins at the new Mamohato 
Children’s Centre, and we sold ten cabins at £35,000 each.

'It was a huge success because people can see how it makes a difference to children’s lives.'

He added that he was going to see his partner and their two children at the weekend.

'He is really very lucky to be alive, you know. Now that we are fathers that makes it all the more frightening,' he said.

The boy who will be king: Asked what kind of uncle he wanted to be, Prince Harry said sweetly that he wanted 'to make sure he has a good upbringing and to keep him out of harm's way and make sure he has fun'

Other guests included the BBC newsreader Kate Silverton, who saw the poverty of Lesotho first hand when she filmed a report there.

The Prince, wearing a blue suit and a white open-necked shirt, told an audience of 140 invited guests that he would not make a long speech because it was 'absolutely roasting' in the small gallery off Oxford Street.

He said of the charity's work: 'In the absence of parents for the vast majority of Lesotho children we at Sentebale we hope are filling the gap as best we can.

'The stigma that surrounds HIV and Aids must be explained and, I hope, understood.

'Sentebale is making a huge difference. We at Sentebale want to give Southern Africa hope for the future.'

The exhibition, Entitled Sentebale - Stories of Hope, is free and runs at the London Getty Images Gallery from July 26.

Meanwhile excited new grandfather 
Prince Charles couldn’t contain his excitement while out and about on 
public engagements yesterday.

He described meeting George for the first time as a ‘great moment’ and told a schoolboy ‘it’s fun to be a grandfather’.

Charles met George Austin, nine, as he opened a new garden at Kemble railway station in Gloucestershire this morning.

George and sister Lucinda, four, were at the station - the closest to the Prince’s Highgrove home - with their grandparents.

He appeared in a humorous mood, 
laughing and joking as he met members of the public, staff and designers
 and unveiled a plaque at the station.

George, who lives in Wimbledon, south 
west London, said: ‘I was asking him about the baby and he said it was 
great meeting him at the hospital. He said it was really fun being a 
grandfather.’

The card read: ‘To HRH the Prince of 
Wales and HRH the Duchess of Cornwall. Congratulations on becoming

him "Congratulations on being a grandad".
