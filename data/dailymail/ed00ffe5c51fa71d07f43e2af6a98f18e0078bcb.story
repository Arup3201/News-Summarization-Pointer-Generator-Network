Jaguar has suspended production of its £1million supercar due to the economic downturn.

Five prototypes of the  200mph C-X75 hybrid, jointly developed with the Williams F1 racing team, were already in production when the plug was pulled.

Up to 100 drivers had shown an interest in what would have been one of the most exclusive supercars on the road, and a direct rival for the Bugatti Veyron and the Audi R8.

The company decided that the economic global recession could not support the production of 250 cars costing £1million each.

A Jaguar spokesman said: 'After a thorough re-assessment of near-term market conditions, the company’s view is that the global economic landscape does not currently support the introduction of a supercar such as C-X75.

The car boasted a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine with an electric motor that helped power it from 0-60 in 2.8 seconds and reach a top speed of over 200mph.

All is not lost, however, as the hybrid technologies, carbon composite materials and the advanced design solutions pioneered by Jaguar and Williams will be used in future Jaguar and Land Rover brands.

Adrian 
Hallmark, Jaguar Global Brand Director said:  'Project C-X75 has already
broken many new barriers in terms of innovation and advanced 
technologies.

'We have achieved an incredible amount and will continue 
to test and develop these technologies, which are highly relevant to 
JLR’s sustainable future. 

'We remain committed to significant on-going 
new product investment -  £2bn in this financial year - which will 
continue to drive the expansion of the JLR business'.

Jaguar plans to finalise the five C-X75 prototypes already in production and may auction them at a later date.
