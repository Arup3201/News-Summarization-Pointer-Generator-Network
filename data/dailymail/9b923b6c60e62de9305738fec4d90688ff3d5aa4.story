The ex-wife of a man who shot dead five schoolgirls seven years ago revealed today the unforgettable moment when members of the Amish community her husband brought to its knees actually offered her their condolences.

Marie Monville appeared on Piers Morgan Live on Wednesday, where she described for the first time how quickly the family of her husband Charlie Roberts were able to forgive.

'He said that they had forgiven Charlie and that they were extending grace and love to our family. They were concerned about me and concerned about our children,' she said.

Touching: Marie Monville, the wife of the Amish schoolhouse shooter, appeared on Piers Morgan Wednesday and revealed the unbelievable moment she was embraced by the victims' families

The way they were: Charlie Roberts opened fire on a one-room school house in 2006. Monville has since forgiven him, and so have the Amish families of Lancaster county, she said

Marie Monville was married to Charlie Roberts, 32, when he opened fire at an Amish 
school in rural Pennsylvania on October 2, 2006.

Mrs Monville, who has since remarried, has now written a book in which she recounts the fateful morning and the fallout thereafter.

Amazingly,
the Amish community actually helped Monville and her family through the
trauma. It began with a visit to her parents' Lancaster County home.

'I
saw some Amish men walking down the street. I knew they were coming to 
my parents' house. And I went to my mom and dad and said, "what do I do? Do I go out to talk to them,"' she said on Piers Morgan.

The deeply religious Monville, who is now remarried, revealed to Piers Morgan that she has moved on, thanks in part to the unbelievable forgiveness shown by the Amish families her husband nearly shattered

She continued: 'My dad said, "you can 
stay inside, I'll go out and talk with them." He knew them. You know, 
they were from our community.'

In an unbelievable display of forgiveness, Monville watcher the Amish men hug her father.

'I
couldn't hear the words they spoke, I saw the embrace,' she said. 'I 
saw them put their arms around my dad and put their hands on his 
shoulder. Everything about their gentleness conveyed the words that I 
couldn't hear.'

'I love the relationship I have with those families,' she said, calling their compassion 'unending.'

'There were several families that had said to me, "You know, at the end of the day, we have our spouse, we have each other to lie in each other's arms and cry but you don't have anyone. And we think about you when you go to bed at night and you're all alone,"' Monville told the Christian Post.

'And that was the most profound thing that someone ever said to me, that they were able to see the really intimate places of my heart and the pain that I endured and to know that they were thinking about me at the end of the day and what my life looked like was really amazing.'

Their ability to forgive was an inspiration for the deeply religious mother.

'I couldn't figure out any way for God to rescue us,' she said, but 'I knew that God was firm.'

Coming to terms with tragedy: Marie Roberts Monville was married to Charles Roberts when he shot dead five girls in an Amish schoolhouse and injured five others seven years ago this week

Her milk truck driver former husband, who was not 
Amish, singled out girls aged between six and 13 in his deadly attack - 
ordering the male pupils and teachers out of the classroom before he 
lined-up and shot the children one-by-one in the head.

The couple's first child had died in 1997 just 20 minutes after she was born three months prematurely.

Unexplained: Roberts, 32, shot dead five little girls and seriously injured five others before turning the gun on himself

She told GMA: 'And in some way he felt like he was getting back at the Lord for the loss that we had sustained.'

Roberts
also made the chilling admission in his letter that he had molested two
relatives although police could not prove any attacks had taken place. 

The father-of-three had acted normal 
on the morning of October 2, 2006.

He had returned home from his night 
shift at 3am and rose to wave his own two children off to school.

Marie Roberts, as she was then, left the house soon after and returned to find rambling suicide notes written by her husband.

She managed to speak to him briefly 
on his phone soon after but didn't understand fully what was happening 
until police arrived at her door.

'It was a gorgeous day, one of those Indian Summer days. We walked down to
the bus stop with the kids and he kissed them and said he loved them,' she said.

'I didn't understand the scope of what was going on until the police 
came to my door. They said that Charlie had walked into the schoolhouse,
that he held the girls hostage and shot them and five of them died 
before he shot himself.

'To know that the man who walked down to the bus that morning and kissed
his own kids and said that he loved them was capable of hurting someone
else's children was unfathomable - yet there was no way to say that it 
didn't happen, because it just had.'

The
shootings devastated the devout Amish community of Lancaster County 
isolated from the modern world with no television or cars to spread the 
message of what happened.

Tragedy: Five schoolgirls were shot dead in Roberts shooting attack after he barricaded himself in to the one room schoolhouse. Police believe he intended to molest his victims but shot them instead when police disrupted his plan

As news spread, grief-stricken families began to arrive at the one room schoolhouse in their traditional buggies and horses.

Five
couples were to be told their little girls had died while Marie Roberts
had to gather together her three children to try and explain what had 
happened.

'My son was five and he was outside playing in the backyard,' Marie says in the film. 'The windows
were open and the breeze was blowing in with the sounds of their 
laughter and playfulness.

'I just soaked in that moment thinking, 'Is this going to be
the last time I ever hear this? In a matter of minutes I'm going to 
have to shatter their world and tell them something no parent would ever want to say.  Am I ever going to hear
them laugh again?'

'I drew them in and we sat there together in the 
silence of that moment almost as if - if we were quiet enough the world would change, but it didn't.'

The gunman's former wife penned a book about coping in the aftermath of the tragedy

Reports at the time suggested that Roberts told his wife in their last phone call that he had molested children in his family 20 years ago and was going to do it again.

Police said they believed this was his intention in taking the girls hostage but was stopped by the arrival of police to the scene.

He had barricaded the door shut and lined the girls up in front of a blackboard and bound their feet.

Police attempted to negotiate with him before he fired the deadly shots using a handgun and shotgun. 

He killed Naomi Rose Ebersole, seven, Anna Mae Stoltzfuz, 12, Marian Fischer, 13 and sisters Mary Liz and Lina Miller, eight and seven.

The most severely injured survivor of the schoolhouse attack remains 
unable to eat, sit or talk.

In December, the victims parents wrote to the families who lost children in the Sandy Hook massacre.

Shooting: A similar classroom in an Amish school near to Nickel Mines. The victims were aged 6 to 13 and included two sisters

Herman Bontrager, a spokesman for the Nickel Mines Amish 
community, said: 'This is a time when the scabs are rubbed raw again.'

Mrs Monville has spoken at many churches about what happened and released a book on her experiences earlier this year.

Entitled One Light Still Shines: My Life Beyond the Shadow of the Amish Schoolhouse Shooting, she says she hopes it will appeal to others who have suffered 'similar brokenness'.

She admits that the months that followed were hard but she relied on her faith to get her through.

'I had never known a place of desperation like that ,' she said.  'There was nowhere 
to run nowhere to hide, there weren't any real answers. I was being 
looked on by the world to give some kind of answer but for me there was nothing for me to go back to but the Lord.

'It doesn't matter what your circumstances are God is in the midst of them.'

When it's someone that you've loved, the lens with which you look at the story is completely different because it is not a story it's your life.'

'I want to invite the reader into my story, knowing that we all have places of similar brokenness regardless of circumstance.  I hope the reader will view their circumstances differently, through the lens of expectancy – looking for God to breathe joy upon the places they need it most and would otherwise expect it least.'

The West Nickel Mines 
Amish School was torn down ten days after the shooting and replaced with 
the New Hope Amish School a few hundred yards away.
