She's been working hard at bootcamp and it seems that Lydia Rose Bright is keen to show off the fruits of her labour.

The former The Only Way Is Essex star, who has made no secret of her passion for fashion, has collaborated on a range of vintage-inspired accessories and oozes poise and glamour as she models the range.

Lydia was invited by VintageStyler.co.uk, which offers affordable, retro-style occasionwear and accessories, to edit and model a range.

Timeless glamour: Vintage fashion lover Lydia Rose Bright has collaborated on a range for VintageStyler.co.uk - and modelled it herself, of course!

Lydia, 22, selected a range of statement items that aim to reflect her own vintage-inspired, feminine style, including necklaces, pastel-hued box clutches and head chains for a look that’s ideal for special days and big nights.

Speaking about the project, Lydia said: 'I am delighted to be the ambassador for the new collection from VintageStyler.co.uk.

Bold and bright: The new range is full of colourful statement jewellery that Lydia loves to wear herself

Getting into character: Lydia, who will be returning to TOWIE in the next few weeks, has even got the perfect vintage hair and make-up in the shoot

'The designs are beautiful and timeless and can be worn from day to evening to make any outfit feel special.'

Lydia has her own eponymous range of vintage clothing, which is sold on Lipstick Boutique and in her shop, Bella Sorella, in Essex.

The 22-year-old star 
recently spent time with her sister Georgia, 24, 
at the luxury Slimmeria Retreat in East Sussex.

Back to black: The Essex star, who left TOWIE in 2012 after splitting with show regular James 'Arg' Argent, wears a floral black dress and bright lipstick in the new shoot

Accessorise all areas: As well as pretty necklaced and headwear, the new range also includes clutch bags

Lydia has 
worked hard on her body and recently wowed in a tiny bikini 
while on holiday with her sister in Cape Verde.

The
 Essex star left TOWIE in 2012 after splitting with show regular James 
'Arg' Argent but she returned in the final episode of the show's 11th 
series in April.

Her
 comeback was an uncomfortable moment for Arg, who initially left the 
room when he clapped eyes on her before returning to have an awkward 
conversation with the brunette beauty.

Shaping up: Lydia flashed her abs during the vigorous workout with her sister Georgia, 24, at the luxury Slimmeria Retreat in East Sussex last week

The hard work is paying off! Lydia flashed her toned physique on the beach in Cape Verde this week

The full collection is available exclusively from VintageStyler.co.uk from 3rd June 2014. Prices range from £10 - £47
