A mother who died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage has left a lasting legacy after her organs saved the lives of six people.

Fitness instructor Lisa Bratt, 40, collapsed when she suffered a bleed on the brain and a stroke after years of unexplained headaches.

Hospital tests revealed her brain was unresponsive so her husband Paul, 38, made the decision to allow doctors to remove her organs.

Part of her liver was donated to a three-year-old boy - allowing him home for the Christmas - and her heart saved the life of a 40-year-old woman from Glasgow.

Her lungs, kidneys and the other half of her liver went to save the lives of four more people in Newcastle, Leeds and Liverpool.

Mr Bratt, from Hartlepool, said: ‘When I got there she had already gone. I knew that.

‘I had a little bit of hope, but doctors warned me even if she had come through she wouldn't have remembered her life.

Mr Bratt agreed to allow his wife's organs to be donated and they have saved six people's lives. The couple are pictured with their sons Michael, 10, and Joshua, nine

‘I never left her bedside, it was horrible. I'm extremely proud Lisa was able to help others - it's a good thing.

‘Lisa was kind, loving, happy-go-lucky and would do anything for anybody.

A brain haemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain.

It can be caused by a head injury but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a ruptured aneurysm.

Symptoms include a sudden, very severe headache, vomiting, fits, loss of consciousness and sudden death.

A brain haemorrhage is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment.

The two treatment options are using medication to prevent further bleeding, and surgery to repair the source of the bleeding.

Haemorrhages most often occur as the result of a brain aneurysm bursting - a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel's wall.

People who smoke, drink heavily, have poorly controlled high blood pressure or who have a family history of aneurysms are most at risk.

About 65 per cent of brain haemorrhage patients survive but many find their recovery slow and frustrating.

About 9,000 people in the UK have a brain haemorrhage every year.

Four out of five patients are aged between 40 and 65. They are more common in women than men.

‘When we found out she had helped that 
little boy go home for Christmas it was overwhelming - I'm tearing up 
just thinking about it.

‘She will be there looking down over us 
knowing she has helped all these people. That was Lisa - she would do 
anything for anyone.’

The newly-qualified fitness trainer was 
driving home after dropping her husband off at a work training course 
when she was forced to pull over due to an overwhelming headache on 
November 18 last year.

Screaming in pain, she ran to a nearby friend's house where she collapsed, suffering a bleed on her brain at the same time as a stroke.

An ambulance took her to the University Hospital of North Tees, in Stockton, but medics could not bring her back.

She was kept clinically alive while doctors took her organs, before pronouncing her dead on November 19.

Mr Bratt faced the task of breaking the news to their children - Natasha, 21, Michael, 10, and nine-year-old Joshua.

The off-shore platform inspector said: ‘The hardest part was when the boys came in from school on the Tuesday and having to tell them.

‘The boys have taken it all okay and Natasha is doing well at the moment.

‘I have loads of family support and people I work with out in Africa have also come to see me - I've been overwhelmed.

‘She was the best mum the kids could ever wish for, she was the best wife, and she doted on her nephews.’

Mr Bratt will get more details of who his wife helped - and maybe even thank you letters - in the coming year.

He also hopes to find out more about why she suddenly collapsed.

Part of Mrs Bratt's liver was used to save the life of a three-year-old boy and receiving it enabled him to go home from hospital for Christmas

‘She was so fit,’ he said. ‘She had just qualified as a fitness instructor, went to the gym every other day and even had a six-pack - she had never been fitter.’

Mrs Bratt’s mother Denise Novak, 60, paid tribute to her eldest child.

She said: ‘She was the best. I have my good days and bad days, but we have to cope.’
