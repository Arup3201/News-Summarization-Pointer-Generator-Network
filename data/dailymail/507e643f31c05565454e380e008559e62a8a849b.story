A woman has been killed and a man is fighting for his life after a horrific crash with their motorbike at a speed trials event.

38-year-old Charlotte Tagg, from Suffolk, was riding in the sidecar of a black Honda Asco when the motorbike crashed during the Brighton Speed Trials on Saturday.

Witnesses said the bike failed to stop at the end of the track at the Dukes Mound end of Madeira Drive in the seaside town and smashed straight into a barrier.

The 64-year-old driver, from London, 
was taken to Brighton’s Royal Sussex County Hospital following the crash
at 6.15pm and is said to be in a critical condition.

Sergeant Huw Watts of Sussex Police’s Road Policing Unit said: ‘Although formal identification has not yet taken place we believe that the woman who tragically died at the Brighton Speed Trials is Charlotte.

‘Our thoughts are with her friends and family at this time.

‘We are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the collision and would still like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police.’

Leonard Wooller vice chair of Brighton and Hove Motor Club said: ‘We don’t know what the cause of the accident was and we will have to wait for the results of the investigation.

‘We’ve not had a fatality at the event for many, many years.

‘It was a great event that unfortunately started slowly because police were investigating a stabbing in Madeira Drive and ended badly with this accident.’

Tragic: According to witnesses, the bike hit a barrier after failing to stop at the end of the track

Allan Weyman, who was visiting the event from Watford, said: ‘I was there and saw the driver and pillion passenger lining up to do their run earlier in the day and thought at the time what an extraordinary looking machine unlike any of the others.

‘I as concerned to see the helicopter land as I approached the scene of the crash looking down from the main road, and by the general body language of those on the scene plus the police presence I feared the worse.

‘My heart goes out to the woman’s family and the driver of the machine.’

Tens of thousands of spectators had headed to the seafront for the historic speed trials with almost 400 motorists scheduled to take part in the quarter mile drag run along the seafront in classic cars and bikes.

No other vehicles were involved, but 
the road was closed as oil spread across the tarmac following the 
collision. Sussex Police have now asked for any witnesses to come 
forward.

A spokesman for Brighton Speed Trials 
told the East Anglian Daily Times: ‘We work incredibly hard throughout 
the year to ensure the safety standards are met.

‘It’s a tragic accident that’s happened and we need to find out exactly what happened before we do anything else.

‘Obviously our condolences go out to the family of this woman. It’s awful and a horrendous thing to happen.’

The speed trials, which are organised 
each year by the Brighton and Hove Motor Club and showcase a wide 
variety of cars and motorbikes, were first held in 1905.

Following the crash, people left condolence messages on the Brighton Speed Trials Facebook page.

John Dyson, of Upminster, north-east 
London, said: 'I have just heard the horrifying news. Our hearts go out 
to the families concerned for the loss they will have to endure for the 
rest of their lives.'

Another racing fan, Ian Stevens, left 
the comment: 'Sad when things like this happen. Thoughts go out to 
family, friends and those that had to deal with the incident.'

Just hours earlier, a stabbing in Madeira Drive had threatened to postpone the speed trials.

Police were called to the scene just after 2.30am, where they found a 60-year-old man with serious injuries. He was taken to hospital and is in a serious condition. A 30-year-old man was arrested.
