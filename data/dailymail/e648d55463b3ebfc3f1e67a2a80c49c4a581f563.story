The maker of Wonder Bread is the most likely company in America to give to Republican causes, the New York Times has discovered.

Wonder Bread owner Flower Foods has donated singularly to Republican candidates for the past 20 years, according to Federal Election Commission data.

Flower Foods does not give the most money to Republicans', however. The baked goods company gave only one-tenth of what Koch Industries' PAC gave to Republicans during the 2012 election cycle, and it has handed out only one donation since.

Flower Foods - the maker of Wonder Bread - is more likely to donate to Republicans than any other company in America

Flower Foods is best known as the owner of Wonder Bread, the brand it acquired last year after previous owner Hostess Brands went out of business. The Georgia based company also produces bread brands Country Kitchen, Home Pride and Nature's Pride, among others, and snack foods brands Tastykake and Mrs. Freshley's.

The publicly traded company is not overtly Republican. Unlike Koch Industries, its owners are not Republican activists. The former family owned company is no longer managed by any direct descendents of the Flowers. The late Langdon S Flowers retired from the company in 1985.

The company's employees are clearly Republicans, however. The Times concluded that employees who list Flowers Foods at their employer had given less than $5,000 in personal contributions to Democrats since the late '80s. Republicans were the recipients of a whopping $509,000 or more of employee's cash.

The baked goods company has given more than $1.8 million to Republican candidates since 1990, data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows. During the same period, it gave $11,500 to Democrats.

The last time Flower Foods' PAC gave to Democrats was during the Republican Revolution of 1994. The following election cycle, the group gave $242,500 to Republicans - more than it has given in any single cycle since.

Center for Responsive Politics' Open Secrets site only show data dating back to 1990, so it is unclear how the company gave to Republicans or Democrats prior to the '90s, but the Times reports that it has donated to Republicans more than 99 percent of the time since 1979.

Flower Foods did not respond to a request for comment from the Times on its giving.

The company has only given to one candidate since 2012 as of the latest FEC filing report, and that was Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina.

It gave Sanford $2,500 in the 2013 special election that put him back in the congressional office he'd held for three terms more than a decade before.

KochPAC has already given $816,000 to Republican candidates ahead of November's elections and $12,000 to Democrats, Open Secrets shows.

It spent nearly as much on Republican causes in 2012 as Flower Foods has spent in the last 24 years combined. Surprisingly, Koch Industries has given only 88.1 percent of its PAC money to Republicans.

Other major donors to Republican causes are Illinois Tool Works, Westingonhouse brand owner Eaton and Bloomin Brands, which owns Outback Steakhouse and Carrabbas Italian Grill. All three have contributed to Republicans over Democrats at a more than 9 to 1 ratio.

Citizen's Financial Group has favored Democrats most, giving 77.5 percent of it's $1 million to Democrats, the Times reports.
