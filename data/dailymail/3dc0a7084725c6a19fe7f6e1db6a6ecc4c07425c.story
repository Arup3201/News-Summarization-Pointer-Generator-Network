Buckingham Palace staff have sparked internal security fears by bringing casual partners met over dating apps back to their living quarters.

Police guarding the royal residences are said to be ‘deeply concerned’ at the number of unvetted overnight guests, many of whom appear to be casual acquaintances met online.

Apps such as Tinder and Grindr allow smartphone users to find potential love matches nearby using GPS locators.

According to well-placed sources, a number of the Queen's 800-plus staff are said to be using online dating apps 

They have proved phenomenally popular and have millions of users around the world – however they have also been criticised for promoting casual sex.

And according to well-placed sources, a number of the Queen’s 800-plus staff are said to use such online dating tools.

While most live-in servants –including butlers, maids and kitchen staff – are not allowed to bring guests into Buckingham Palace itself, they are permitted to sign in visitors to their living quarters at St James’s Palace and the Royal Mews.

This situation is not new, but the rise of dating apps has sparked concerns among the Metropolitan Police that servants are bringing back guests whom they know nothing about. 

The source said: ‘There are real and serious security concerns at Buckingham Palace about members of staff use of dating apps such as Tinder, which can be rather sleazy.

‘The palace police are particularly unhappy about the number of guests of servants staying overnight, especially when they may have only just met on Tinder.

They know nothing of the guests’ background and say they could be anyone.

‘It is a security nightmare, especially in the current climate. The guests are allowed to stay at St James’s Palace but some have complained that when they leave they get asked “a million questions” by officers. But police say they are only doing their job.’

One former head of royal protection, Chief Superintendent Dai Davies, said yesterday that the problem of overnight guests in palace accommodation was the ‘Achilles heel’ of royal security. He said: ‘Historically this has always been a problem, even when I was in charge way before the introduction of these so-called dating apps.

‘If members of staff lived in certain quarters such as the Royal Mews and Kensington Palace, which have both single sex and married quarters, they were, and I presume still are, permitted to bring back unvetted guests.

‘Often these guests were total strangers. It makes a complete mockery of the security structure, unfortunately.’

The Palace are said to be concerned with staff bringing back people they have met on Tinder, a dating app, which allow smartphone users to find potential love matches using GPS 

Mr Davies was appointed as unit commander in charge of royal protection for the Queen and her family in 1995, and was responsible for both palace and personal protection.

‘It was something that greatly concerned me at the time and I suspect is still an Achilles heel,’ he added.

‘I am sure it will be of concern to the director of security, particularly given that we are still operating at the second highest level of threat to the country.’

A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment, saying they never discussed security matters. One official explained, however, that there was a ‘clear internal policy, advising staff as to rules on guest access’.

The aide also rejected the suggestion that an internal link had been made between the use of such dating apps and any specific risk to security.
