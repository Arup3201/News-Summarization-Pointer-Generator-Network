Tearful: Kellie Maloney delivered an emotional speech at the Ukip conference today

Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney received a standing ovation after delivering an emotional speech at the Ukip conference today.

Ms Maloney was close to tears as she read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide at the annual meeting in Margate, Kent.

The longtime Ukip supporter was also praised by Nigel Farage as proof that his party was 'open to everyone'.

Ms Maloney also said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues and added 'we are human beings too'.

She was given a standing ovation after reading a poem from two children to their transsexual parent who had committed suicide.

'This poem I am going to read is a really personal poem for me and my family,' she said. 

'Both my daughters and I met this brother and sister and my daughters feared they might have to do this at my funeral but we pulled through all our dark moments.' 

The audience broke into applause to show their support when Ms Maloney's voice started to crack during the reading. 

Ms Maloney started her speech by apologising for homophobic comments she made while standing to become London Mayor in 2004.  At the time, the high-profile promoter said she would not campaign in Camden because there were 'too many gays'. 

Today, Ms Maloney said: 'I have learned to say sorry and apologise if I am wrong.

'I made a terrible mistake in 2004 when I made a derogatory remark about the gay community, and to them I apologise.

'I had to come to terms with myself and accept that I was a transsexual. It is something I hid and something I fought.

Protesters clashed in Margate as an estimated 250 people rallied against the party.

Anti-Ukip demonstrators outnumbered about 50 party supporters who were in the seaside town for the annual two-day conference.

One woman was arrested on suspicion of common assault.

A Kent Police spokeswoman said all protest groups were co-operating with police.

'There have been some very minor verbal exchanges,' she said.

'No-one has been injured and the protest has generally been conducted peacefully.

'Officers remain in the local area to reassure the public and to respond to any incidents if required.'

'I wanted to transition very quietly, but unfortunately my transition is probably one of the most public events of 2014.' 

Party leader Nigel Farage praised Ms Maloney's speech, saying it was proof Ukip was 'open to everyone'.

Closing conference, Mr Farage said it had shown Ukip was 'far, far from a one-man band'.

'The support that I've had as your leader on a personal basis is touching, but also enduring,' he said. 'This party is open to everyone. Our only pride, our only prejudice is that we are patriotic.

'Over the years we have been underestimated by all the media and all the commentators and let me tell you something, they are underestimating the power of this party.

'We will once again surprise everybody, we will put enough MPs in to Westminster to make a difference and be in a position of power.'

Mr Farage went on: 'I know that we are in for a rough tough 67 days, but the prize is very very great. I am determined to lead us to a big success on May 7.'
