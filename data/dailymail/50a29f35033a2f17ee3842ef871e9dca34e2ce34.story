A 26-year-old man has been charged today with causing death by dangerous driving after a 80-year-old woman was killed as she crossed the road.

The woman suffered serious injuries in the 'hit and run' incident in Yardley, Birmingham, yesterday.

West Midlands Ambulance Service said the
woman had suffered 'multiple serious injuries and was in cardiac 
arrest' when medics arrived at about 11.30am.

Medics said she was in cardiac arrest when she was found. A man handed himself into police hours later

She died a short time later, while the driver sped away from the scene.

The woman's family has been informed but police have not yet publicly named her.

A large-scale police operation to trace the car and driver started immediately after the crash.

Some hours after the accident officers found a damaged blue Vauxhall Astra dumped at the roadside about six miles away in Solihull, which police believe is the car involved in the incident.

It was being forensically tested today.

The suspect was arrested after he handed himself in at Stechford police station.

A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: 'A 26-year-old man has tonight been charged with the offence of causing death by dangerous driving.

'He will appear before Birmingham Magistrates' Court tomorrow.'

The car believed to have been involved in the incident was recovered six miles away in Solihull.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said medics attempted to resuscitate the woman as soon as they arrived.

However, they said 'despite their best efforts, nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed dead'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
