A man accused of raping a mother and her 8-year-old daughter at knife-point in Alabama is behind bars after leading law-enforcement officials on a four-day manhunt.

David Pitts, 44, had been on the run from Ozark since Thursday, when he was accused of raping a 30-year-old woman at gunpoint and making her daughter watch.

He then allegedly assaulted the little girl in front of her mother.

Pitts was arrested without incident at Bethesda Hospital East after the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office received a tip that he was being treated there.

The 30-year-old victim said Pitts, who lived nearby, was inside her home when she arrived with her daughter Thursday evening.

He abducted them at knife point and made the woman drive him to a secluded location some 10 miles away, where he assaulted them.

He held the victims overnight, at one point producing a gun and threatening them with it, authorities said.

Pitts, who knew the victims, eventually swapped vehicles and let them go.

He is charged with kidnapping, rape, sexual abuse, theft of property and burglary.

'It's shocking to hear something close like that,' neighbor Willie Baker told WSFA. 'It's just sad.'

Another neighor, Thomas Jones, told the station: 'All I can tell you is that he is a weird guy, especially when he drives by here like he is noticing everything and checking everything out â€” so I just watch him.'

Pitts remains at the Palm Beach County Jail, where he is awaiting extradition back to Alabama.
