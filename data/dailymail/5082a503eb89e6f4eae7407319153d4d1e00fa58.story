The arrest of a 94-year-old alleged sex offender at his retirement home in Michigan proves that it's never too late to go to jail.

William Bricker, 94, was arraigned on Thursday in Grand Traverse County after a warrant for his arrest was issued in Wyoming for the sexual assault of two boys for whom he was a live-in counselor at a Jackson Hole Youth Camp called Teton Valley Ranch Camp. 

Upnorthlive.com reports that William Bricker was arrested at his retirement community, the Tendercare Health and Rehab Center in Garfield Township, on September 23. 

Arrested at 94: William Bricker was arrested at his retirement community in Michigan for the alleged sexual assaults of two young boys in 1962 and 1985 at the summer camp in Wyoming where he was employed 

'On Tuesday, Sept 23, 2014, we (Tendercare) were contacted by the local police department inquiring about an individual who was residing at our center. The individual was arrested, removed from Tendercare Traverse City and is in the custody of authorities,' says Debbie smith, an Administrator of Tendercare Traverse City.

'We are cooperating with authorities as they continue their investigation of this situation,' she added.

In the court files, one of the now-grown accusers alleges Bricker molested him when he was his live-in camp counselor at Teton Valley Ranch Camp during the summer of 1962. 

The other accuser alleges Bricker molested him during a four-day stint at the camp during the summer of 1985. 

Teton County Wyoming authorities learned of the alleged abuse when one of the victims reported the incident to the Boy Scouts of America at an undisclosed time.

Jackson Hole News & Guide reports that the 1962 victim was 13-years-old at the time of abuse and says that 'more than once' Bricker entered his sleeping bag and touched him 'in all the wrong places,' including his genitals.

The 1985 victim says he was molested up to six times by Bricker who also touched his genitals and 'forced him to ejaculate.'

Investigators have been working on the case for several months but camp directors knew about the incidents in 1997 and didn't report them to law enforcement.

Bricker faces one count of immoral acts with a child in addition to one count of immoral or indecent acts both in Wyoming.

In order for Bricker to be extradited, the court process in Michigan must be completed.

'He would be extradited to Teton County Wyoming for charges here,' said Teton County Public Information Officer, Charlotte Reynolds.

The Mail Online contacted the retirement community but no one was available for comment. It's unclear as to how long Bricker was a resident at Tendercare Traverse City. 

The  summer camp is now under new ownership by the TVRC Education Foundation. They released a statement on Thursday.

 'We seek and support justice for any victim, and share deep concerns that any person or persons may have been harmed,'the TVRC-EF Board said.
