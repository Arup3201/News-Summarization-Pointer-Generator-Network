A man reported missing for four years while his wife and her friend claimed £77,000 benefits in his name died of natural causes, a coroner has ruled.

The remains of Geoffrey Howard Sturdey, 60, were eventually found under a rockery at the 'wildlife haven' and religious community where they lived near Tregaron, Ceredigion, Wales.

Wife Rebekah, 56, and friend Boqe-Ore Adie, 43, secretly buried him and claimed he’d gone travelling round Europe.

In February this year, they were each given 20-month prison sentences at Swansea Crown Court after pleading guilty to unlawful burial and fraud.

At an inquest into Mr Sturdey’s death, Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton declined to offer his condolences to Mrs Sturdey, who was present at the inquest having already completed the custodial part of her punishment, because it would 'not be appropriate'.

Boqer-Ore Adie’s daughter Hazel was also present at the inquest.

The inquest heard how the pathologist who undertook a post-mortem on Mr Sturdey’s body could not give a formal cause of death, and he could only be identified from his dental records.

Mr Sturdey’s GP, Jacqueline James, the last professional person to see him alive, paid him a visit in October 2008, and identified a number of risk factors, including diabetes and high blood pressure, which she likened to a 'ticking time bomb'.

Detective constable Sarah Totterdale from Cardigan CID, gave lengthy evidence about the 'very complex' police investigation which took place at Mr Sturdey’s home - Beth Berith, Llwynygroes, near Tregaron - in June 2013.

She said that following suspicions raised by the Department for Work and Pensions, the house was searched and a number of documents were found, including a note which read '48 days since Shamar fell asleep', and a letter from Adie’s daughter Hazel, which said 'some day soon me and Shamar will be raised'.

Personal readings were also found in a plastic wallet, one of which said: 'Shamar fell asleep on the sixth day of the seventh moon'.

The inquest heard how during the police investigation, it became apparent that four women: Sturdey, Boqer-Ore, Hazel and another daughter, Karmel Adie had an interest in the Old Testament and Hebrew teachings. 'Shamar' is a Hebrew word meaning 'to watch'.

A nine-page document relating to the burial of Mr Sturdey was discovered, and at around 5pm on 17 June police found an 'area of interest' in a flower bed near the front door, where his body was discovered.

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Mr Brunton added: 'If matters had ended there, and he had been buried normally, we wouldn’t be here today.

'It’s not for me to go into the criminal aspects but what happened afterwards meant that there was a very complex enquiry. I find that his body had been buried in accordance with his will in a raised flower bed near the front door of his property.

'Basic requirements were clearly not met in this case. Mr Sturdey’s body lay undisturbed for five years until the enquiry started. This is undoubtedly a most extraordinary and mysterious death.'

He added: 'It is customary for me to offer my condolences to the relatives of the deceased, but in this case I don’t think that’s appropriate.'
