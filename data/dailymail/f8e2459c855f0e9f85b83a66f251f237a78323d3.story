Three councils in some of the most expensive parts of London are drawing up plans to build ‘middle class’ housing estates.

The boroughs of Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea want to be allowed to borrow billions of pounds to build affordable homes for well-off professionals who struggle to get on the housing ladder in the capital.

Councillors warn parts of London are becoming ‘polarised’ between the very wealthy and those in subsidised council housing.

The councils say too many people on middle-incomes cannot afford to buy homes in expensive parts of London like Mayfair

Using public money to build homes for middle class families would help preserve the community ‘mix’ in areas where the average family home can cost more than £1million.

Under the plan, due to be presented to ministers today, the councils want to borrow against the £2.4 billion value of their existing stock of 32,000 homes to build more houses.

Middle-class families who move into the new homes would then be charged higher rents than those on lower incomes.

Cllr Jonathan Glanz, responsible for housing in Westminster, said: ‘This proposal is all about giving those hard working people on average salaries at least some chance of living in Westminster.

‘At present they are simply priced out, so Westminster – like other parts of central London – becomes a property world polarised between the very wealthy and those in affordable housing.

‘We need to continue ensuring that we provide for a wide range of people and maintain mixed communities, including middle class people on middle-range salaries.’

The councils want Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to give them more freedom to borrow against their assets to pay for new homes

The Government has already given councils extra freedom in how they manage their housing stock, but the councils want to go further.

Today they will present plans for a pilot of 300 homes in Westminster to Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

Today they will submit their plan for a pilot scheme of 300 homes on a new “middle-class” estate to the Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles.

In this business case, we have shown how such a programme (based upon incremental investment of £53 million) could:

The £53million scheme would generate a surplus of £500,000 in rents in the first decade, generating 7,000 jobs in construction.The councils want changes to be made to the Housing Revenue Account rules limiting what local authorities can borrow.

The business case states: 'The opportunity is to use a housing portfolio valued at some £2.4billion not only to meet the current housing needs of the poorest members of society but also to support people’s aspirations to improve their careers and housing choices.

'Many families are squeezed out of the area as suitable accommodation is unaffordable to people on middle incomes – especially if they want an ownership stake in their home.

'Despite the abundance of jobs in the area, there are pockets of entrenched worklessness, particularly in areas of social housing, where residents become locked into welfare dependency and unemployment becomes the norm.'
