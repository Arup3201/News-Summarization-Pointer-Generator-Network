Laura Robson cemented her status as the golden girl of British tennis yesterday by reaching the last 16 at Wimbledon.

The 19-year-old produced a spirited fightback to defeat New Zealand’s Marina Erakovic in three sets.

But she said afterwards that she wouldn’t have made it without her ‘amazing’ support from the crowd.

Family support: Laura Robson is congratulated by her brother Nicholas, who is working as a court attendant during the Championships, after her victory today

Laura’s win means it is the first 
time since Tim Henman and Sam Smith made the same stage in 1998 that 
there has been British interest in both the men’s and women’s singles at
 the start of Wimbledon’s second week.

It gave the nation an unexpected  
feel-good boost on a sun-drenched   Saturday and raised expectations 
that the 19-year-old may yet make it all the way to the final. But 
five-time champion Serena Williams stands in her way.

The pair are on course to meet in the quarter-final, should they both advance beyond the next round.

At home: Kathy Robson, Laura's mother, came to watch her in 2010 but this year she has stayed in Greece to look after the family dogs

The British number one slipped during a nervous first set but recovered

Yesterday Laura, the British No 1, 
lost the first set 1-6 but took the next two 7-5 6-3. At one stage she 
was only three points away from a straight-sets defeat.

She now faces either Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi or Alison Riske of the United States in tomorrow’s fourth round. 
As Laura came off court, she bumped fists with her 21-year-old brother 
Nick, who has been working as a court attendant at the tournament.

Andy Murray appeared in the Royal Box today alongside his fellow Olympic and Paralympic champions

The Olympic and US Open champion was introduced to the crowd by Sue Barker to rapturous applause as he enjoyed a weekend off before his fourth round match on Monday

In evident delight, she also appeared
 to mouth ‘yes’ before waving to the crowd. She said the ‘amazing 
support’ had given her strength after she had started the match badly. I
 was really struggling to return her serve,’ she said.

‘I just tried to work as hard as 
possible and stick with it until she started to get nervous, and that’s 
what happened. The crowd were amazing.

‘I’m so happy to get through but 
definitely couldn’t have done it without them. I can definitely play 
better than I did today, but it’s tough to play your best  tennis all 
the time.’

Laura’s victory sparked jubilation across the country and a huge cheer across the courts of SW19.

But her elevation to sporting darling
 leaves a quandary. What to call the famous slope at the All England 
Club where spectators traditionally gather to raucously cheer their 
heroes? When Laura is on court there appear to be two competing names: 
Robson Green and Robson Ridge.

The former, a light-hearted reference to the actor and singer, appears to be the most popular.

However, others argue that Robson 
Ridge is a more  natural choice because it follows the alliterative 
tradition of Henman Hill and Murray Mound.

Laura was born in Melbourne, 
Australia, but moved to Britain at the age of six. Her father Andrew, an
 oil company executive, sat in the stands but Laura mother’s Kathy 
remained at their new home near Athens to look after the family’s two 
pet labradors.

Asked whether her mother would now join them, Laura said, ‘I’m doing OK
without her here’ – but added that she missed her and that they spoke after every match.

Serena Williams was given an apology by presenter Annabel Croft after making a slur about her backside

It is far from love-all at Wimbledon these days – at least as far as the women are concerned.

Following last week’s verbal cat-fight between Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, TV presenter Annabel Croft has been forced to apologise to Williams, left, after making ‘offensive’ comments about the player’s ‘huge backside’.

Former British No 1 Croft, 46, made  the remarks while chatting to guests at a corporate lunch.

Croft later apologised, and added: ‘Serena has a magnificent bottom that every woman should aspire to.’

Laura’s grandmother Pat Dwyer told 
The Mail on Sunday that she couldn’t bear to watch her finest hour. ‘I 
get far too nervous, I can’t bear it,’ she said from her home in Albany,
 Western Australia.

‘We video it. I have to hide in the 
kitchen and my husband calls out to me, “She’s winning!’’ and I’m happy.
 But I watch it on video the next day.

‘Kathy sends me text messages every day. She is thrilled, of course, and a very proud mum.’

Laura’s uncle, Larry Dwyer, who  
lives in Fremantle, near Perth, said: ‘I think she’s a bloody champion, 
mate. We’re as proud as punch of her.’

Fans with tickets for day six of the championships were looking forward to a dry and bright day of tennis after yesterday's rain delays

Visitors filled St Mary's Walk at the All England Club on what promised to be a glorious sunny day of tennis

Britain's Olympic heroes of last summer were greeted with wild cheers 
from the crowd when they graced the Royal Box at Wimbledon’s Centre 
Court  yesterday.

The guests included cyclists Laura Trott, Sir Chris Hoy and 
Victoria Pendleton, and rowers Helen Glover and Katherine Grainger.

They were later joined by tennis gold medal winner Andy Murray, who was 
enjoying a weekend off from his quest for Wimbledon glory
