A boy aged 14 today became one of Britain’s youngest ever degree students when he started his first day at university.

Brainbox Wajih Ahmed, from Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, officially enrolled on an economics degree at the University of Southampton.

He picked up his new student ID before heading off to an introductory lecture as the youngest ever student at the university.

Incredibly Wajih isn't the only genius in the family - his brother Zohaib achieved his second A-level in maths aged just ten.

But it is Wajih who is taking the first steps into Higher Education.

He is aiming for a first class honours degree to add to his already impressive haul of 15 GCSEs and four A-levels.

He will also attend trials for the university’s football and badminton teams - competing against people more than four years older than him.

Wajih is already making waves among his new peers, with one fellow student calling him a 'legend' upon meeting the child prodigy.

Earlier this month Xavier Gordon-Brown became Britain's youngest student to embark on a degree aged 12.

The prodigy began a maths degree with the Open University but will be accompanied to lectures by his mum.

Xavier achieved an A* in maths aged just 8.

Wajih will continue to live at his 
home, which is just four miles from the university campus, with his mum 
Saadia and dad Usman for the duration of the three year course.

Mrs Ahmed, 40, said: 'I can’t wait for the day when we go to see him pick up his degree, it will be amazing.

'I’m sure seeing him graduate will be just as emotional as the day we picked up his first GCSE.'

Mr Ahmed said: 'I cannot find the words to express my pride.'

Wajih scored an impressive 100 per cent in his A-level physics and 93 per cent in his AS-level economics.

He has been awarded A*s in A-level maths, further maths and an A in A-level chemistry.

He got an A* in maths GCSE at the tender age of nine and since then he’s picked up A*s in GCSE statistics, physics, chemistry, biology and R.E.

If all goes to plan he could have a BSc degree by the age of 17.

And Wajih isn't planning to stop there saying he will move on to do a PhD before starting a career as an actuary.

Wajih, who lists his hobbies as playing Xbox and football, said it had been a life-long dream of his to start university at the age of 14.

'I’m really excited,' he said.

Professor Debra Humphris, Pro Vice-Chancellor of Education at the university, said: 'We are delighted to welcome Wajih.'
