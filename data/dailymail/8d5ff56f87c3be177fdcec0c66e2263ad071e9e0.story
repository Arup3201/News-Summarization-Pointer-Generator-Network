A former chairman of the Falls Church Democratic Party charged with molesting two young girls is accused of plotting to have them killed before they testified against him during his trial.

Michael Gardner, 50, from Falls Church, Virginia, is said to have approached an inmate in 2013 about finding a hit man to kill the young girls. The inmate he contacted notified police in January about their multiple conversations, according to court documents.

In a letter, presented during a pretrial motion, the inmate said he told Gardner his friend could help with his 'three problems' that he had 'pre-trial' - which allegedly referred to the two girls and an unspecified third issue.

It has not been revealed whether the lives of the girls, who were aged nine and ten at the time of the assault, are in danger but police said the potential threats were taken seriously.

One of the victim's mothers said the new allegations were 'unbelievable', according to WUSA9.

Ana Down, a friend of the victim's families, said: 'They're being terrorized over and over and over again and now, with these new allegations, it's beyond belief.'

Following a polygraph test the inmate took, he revealed Gardner had also targeted a detective and the two prosecutors as potential murder victims.

During the pretrial motion, a letter from the inmate to Gardner was quoted saying: 'I want you to know I haven't forgotten what we've discussed. The friend you asked me to contact to see if he could help with the "three problems" you have pre-trial will be passing through VA on a FL to NY "run".'

'Get back to me right away because I don't [want] his visiting you to interfere with Robin and the kids [sic] anticipated visit.'

In 2011, Gardner was convicted of molesting two girls during his daughter's slumber party for her tenth birthday, according to the Washington Post.

He was sentenced to 22 years in prison before the conviction was overturned by Virginia's Supreme Court that ruled the trial judge stopped the defense attorney from asking character witnesses about Gardner. He was later released and granted a new trial.

In 2011, Gardner was convicted of molesting two girls during his daughter's slumber party for her tenth birthday and sentenced to 22 years in prison - but the conviction was overturned. He was arrested last October for molesting a young girl under the age of 13 who is also a family member. His wife Robin (right) is set to testify against him in a pretrial hearing

He was arrested again last October for allegedly abusing another young girl in 2009 who was under the age of 13 at the time, and is also a family member, according to WJLA.

Gardner's attorney Chris Liebig is wanted to stand on trial by prosecutors to testify about the revelations in the case.

Liebig believes the informant is a 'professional snitch' and said Gardner denies the allegations.

Robin Gardner, his wife and former mayor of Falls Church, is set to testify on Monday in a pretrial hearing concerning the most recent molestation allegations her husband faces involving their relative.  

Gardner's trial is scheduled to begin on March 4, but next week a judge is going to determine how the new allegations impact the case.
