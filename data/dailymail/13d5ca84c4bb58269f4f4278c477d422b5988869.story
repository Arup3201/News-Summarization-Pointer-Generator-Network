The only surviving ‘Lord Kitchener Wants You’ First World War recruiting poster in public hands has gone on the market for £15,000.

The incredibly rare poster was responsible for the enlistment of millions of men and has since become one of the iconic images of the war.

But despite its success and popularity, it was not produced on the same scale as other recruiting posters - and only three originals have survived.

The other two are in the Imperial War Museum in London and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, meaning this poster is the only one in the world that can be bought.

The poster started off life as the front cover of a 1914 edition of magazine London Opinion which had commissioned renowned artist Alfred Leete.

The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, which commissioned all the recruiting posters, spotted the artwork and turned it into a poster of their own.

It was then plastered on billboards and hoardings around the country - but unlike other recruiting posters only around 10,000 were made.

Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, was a well-respected military leader and the poster became one of the enduring images of the war effort.

The poster was so successful it was copied by the Americans who replaced Kitchener with Uncle Sam.

Kitchener was killed in 1916 when the warship taking him to negotiations in Russia was sunk by a German mine.

The poster for sale was bought at auction in 1983 for £100 and has been in a private collection ever since.

Experts have tipped it to fetch £15,000  when it is sold online by Dorset-based auction house Onslows.

The poster will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9.

Patrick Bogue, auctioneer, said: 'When war broke out in 1914 the British army only had a real problem on their hands because they only had about 150,000 soldiers.

'Lord Kitchener was a respected leader and strategist who had found fame in the Boer War and during the last days of the British Empire.

'He was too old to serve as a general and so he was hired to take on the mammoth role of recruiting more soldiers.

'Most recruiting posters made by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee that were reproduced in the hundreds of thousands and distributed to all corners of the British Empire.

'But perhaps only 10,000 copies of the Lord Kitchener poster were made and they would only have gone on display in Britain.

'The reason is that the poster was first made by Alfred Leete for the front cover of London Opinion magazine.

'It was so popular that the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee sought permission to use the front page as a recruiting poster.

'The only thing different was that they changed the wording from ‘needs you’ to ‘wants you’.

'It was a hugely successful poster and was responsible for tens of thousands of men enlisting in the Army.

'Only two other original copies exist and they are both in museums.

'The Lord Kitchener poster is the holy grail of historic recruiting posters and this copy is the only one in the world that you can actually buy.'

The poster was purchased in 1983 for just £100 and is expected to fetch at least £15,000 when it is auctioned later this summer
