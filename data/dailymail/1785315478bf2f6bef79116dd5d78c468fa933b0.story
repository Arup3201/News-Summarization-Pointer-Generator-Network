These dramatic pictures show the moment a cyclist was hurled from his bike and sent flying to the ground in a shocking hit-and-run incident which is believed to have been a ‘deliberate’ attack.

The horrifying CCTV footage captures the moment the rider was thrown over the handlebars of his bike after a car ploughed into the back of him in Hyde, Greater Manchester.

After the collision, the driver of the blue estate car immediately reversed in an attempt to free the bike from under its wheels before making a quick getaway.

The cyclist was left stranded in the road with injuries to his leg, arm and back. However, remarkably his injuries are not deemed to be too serious and he is expected to make a full recovery.

Police said the car ‘drove intentionally into the back of him, slamming him to the ground’ in the ‘deliberate attack', which occurred at around 2:15pm on Saturday.

Officers are now hunting the motorist involved in the shocking incident, after the driver fled the scene following the attack.

Detective Constable Darren Byrne said: ‘This was a deliberate, shocking attack against an innocent man, who was lucky to escape more serious injury.

‘We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the incident, or perhaps even the car in question, which in this case was used as a weapon by the offender.

‘We hope that this appeal and the CCTV footage of the event will jog someone's memory and help us track down the perpetrator of this seemingly random attack.’
