Thousands of shoes of all shapes and sizes, lined up alongside each other heel to toe, you could be forgiven for thinking this was some kind of modern art installation.

In fact these startling images are from a new Guinness World Record set by National Geographic Kids magazine for the largest number of shoes collected for recycling in one place as part of their Run for the Planet campaign.

Staff at the headquarters in Washington D.C emptied more than 50 gigantic boxes filled with unwanted trainers of all kinds sent by families and children from across America and set a new record of 16,407.

All of the used trainers were 
collected from families and kids who wanted to help make a difference.

But celebrities also contributed to with some famous footwear coming from the likes of Taylor Swift, One
Direction, Eli Manning, Danica Patrick, and Amanda Beard.

The
athletic shoes will be sent to the Nike Reuse-A-Shoe program which 
recycles shoes into a material used in surfaces like basketball courts and running tracks.

Last year, National Geographic Kids magazine set another Guinness World Record after 30,914 people helped take the title for most people running 100 metres in 24 hours.

National Geographic staff emptied more than 50 boxes full of shoes and arranged them outside their headquarters heel to toe
