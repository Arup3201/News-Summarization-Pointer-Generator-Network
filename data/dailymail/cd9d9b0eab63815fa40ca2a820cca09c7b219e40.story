A man who killed a convicted sex offender by setting fire to his flat in a bid to force him to move out has been jailed for 10 years.

Daniel Martin pushed a blazing wheelie bin up against the front door of Andrew Heath's flat in Worcester in the early hours of December 14, 2011.

This sparked a fire which consumed much of the flat, killing the 52-year-old victim.

Sentencing Martin, 25, for manslaughter at Birmingham Crown Court today, Mrs Justice Thirlwall said the crime was 'shockingly stupid'.

She said the killer had intended 'to do something so frightening, it would cause him to move away from the area where he had lived since 2001'.

'You say you threw stones at his window to try and wake him and say you saw a light come on,' she added. 'Whatever you did, it was too little too late.

'You say your intention was only to frighten the victim and the prosecution accept you did not intend to kill or attempt to cause really serious harm.'

The judge added that Martin was not a danger to the public, but he 'was a liar and thoroughly anti-social', with a long record of previous convictions.

Mrs Justice Thirlwall accepted that Martin had expressed genuine remorse after pleading guilty to the crime.

She also heard prosecution evidence indicating Martin had an IQ in the lowest percentile.

Mr Heath died of smoke inhalation in what the judge said must have been a 'terrifying experience', in which he would have known he would almost certainly die.

Mrs Justice Thirlwall added the fire spread quickly, burning through the door and up Mr Heath's stairway into the flat.

His burned body was found by firefighters slumped against a radiator.

Investigation: Police in the street where the crime occurred in December 2011

The victim had five convictions for gross indecency and indecent assault against teenage boys aged between 14 and 17 in Leicester and Birmingham between 1985 and 1999.

The court heard that he was known as 'the fag man' because he used to give teenagers cigarettes in an effort to 'befriend' them.

Martin was separately jailed for three years for two burglaries, carried out before he was arrested over Mr Heath's killing in October last year.

He was further imprisoned for six months for assaulting another man in the street in Worcester, with all the sentences ordered to run concurrently.

Afterwards, Mr Heath's sister Leia Charleson said his death had had a devastating effect on the health of their parents, who were unable to come to terms with what happened.

Death: Martin apparently only meant to scare Mr Heath in order to force him out of the area

'Both of my parents passed away without having an answer to their only son's death, and before Daniel Martin admitted his guilt,' she said.

Ms Charleson welcomed the outcome as 'some comfort' for the family's grief.

'Despite what Andrew did in the past he did not deserve to die in such a cruel way,' she added.

Three of Martin's friends were also jailed for 14 months each in March this year after they talked about frightening witnesses in the case on the internet.

Marcus Taylor, 25, Gary Dayus, 26, and Thomas Barnes, 21, who billed their group as the 'Warndon Manz', warned about 'getting the snitches' and running them out of town.

The court heard that Taylor posted on a social media site: 'We will get a massive crew together and run them out of Worcester' before referring to taking one witness's 'head off'.
