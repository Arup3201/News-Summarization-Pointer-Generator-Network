Historians have recreated a 2,300-year-old Iron Age log boat hand-carved from a tree trunk.

More than 200 people helped fashion the one-tonne log boat over a three-week period from a section of fallen 80ft oak tree.

The 15ft vessel is a scaled down copy of a 35ft Iron Age log boat discovered at the bottom of Poole Harbour almost 50 years ago.

The National Trust has constructed a 2,300-year-old Celtic log boat over the course of three weeks in tribute to the one discovered in Poole harbour in 1964

The original boat, discovered in 1964, was discovered after routine dredging work but it is now only display at Poole Museum.

Visitors to Brownsea Island, the largest of eight islands in Poole Harbour, helped shape the flat-fronted boat using an adze, an ancient axe-like tool used for wood carving.

Two 4ft paddles were sculpted from the same piece of timber as the boat.

For years it was kept submerged in fresh water to help preserve and protect it, but experts feared it could disintegrate.

The original Bronze age boat is preserved with sugar in Poole museum. Thought to date back to 300BC, it was accidentally uncovered in during dredging work in Poole Harbour

Historians spent many painstaking hours on the Brownsea island oak tree to convert it into an ancient logboat. They used an adze, an ancient axe-like tool used for wood carving, to make to boat more authentic

The original boat is thought to have been built by the Durotriges, an ancient Celtic tribe that inhabited Dorset, to navigate Poole Harbour's 14 square miles of water

The Bronze Age in Britain spanned from 2,500BC to 800BC.

It is generally thought that the new bronze tools and weapons identified with this age were brought over from continental Europe.

The skulls recovered from burial sites in Britain from the Bronze Age are different in shape from Stone Age skulls.

This would suggest that new ideas and new blood were brought over from the continent.

Stone and bronze can be used together, subject to the availability of both materials.

True bronze is a combination of 10% tin and 90% copper. Both materials were readily available in Britain at this time.Before its entry into Britain, the Bronze Age was in full swing in Europe.

The island of Crete was centre for the expansion of the bronze trade to Europe. The Mycenaeans created the finest bronze weapons.

In 1995 the ancient boat was soaked in ten tonnes of sugar solution, where it remained for five years.It went on show in Poole Museum in 2007.

 original boat is thought to have been built by the Durotriges, an

14 square miles of water.

Its replica will now go on display at Brownsea Island.

Reuben Hawkwood, the island's head ranger, said: 'The idea of building a log boat had been suggested a few times and then one day a huge oak tree was blown down.

'It all came together and we thought it would be a fun, interesting and relevant project.

'We cut the log to size and then enlisted the help of staff, volunteers and around 200 visitors to chip away at the log.

'It
 took three solid weeks to make. When we launched the boat and it worked
 there was a huge sense of excitement, achievement and relief.

'Not
 only did the log boat float but it paddles very well. Because of its 
weight it takes a little while to get going but once it does it works 
well.

Historians said that building the replica using traditional tools was fascinating because it forced them to think like ancient man in order to overcome the same problems they would have faced over 2,000 years ago

'It felt like we were recreating something that had happened thousands of years ago.

'Building it using traditional tools was fascinating because it forced us to think like ancient man to overcome the same problems they would have faced.

'It was hugely rewarding, and probably the best thing I have done since coming to the island.'
