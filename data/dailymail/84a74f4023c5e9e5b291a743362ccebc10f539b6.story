Amazon has won U.S.
federal regulators' approval to test its drone delivery service.

The
e-commerce giant hopes to speed packages to
customers through the air - despite public concern over the safety
and privacy implications.

The Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it had
issued an experimental airworthiness certificate to an Amazon
unit and its prototype drone design, allowing it to conduct
outdoor test flights on private, rural land in Washington state.

the company must supply monthly data to the regulators, and conduct flights at 400 feet (120 metres) orbelow and in 'visual meteorological conditions,'

Amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air.

The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds. 

About 86 percent of Amazon's deliveries are 5 pounds or less, the company said.

'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' Amazon has said.

The experimental certificate applies to a particular drone
design and Amazon must obtain a new certification for test
flights if it modifies the drone.

In return, the company must supply monthly data to the
regulators, and conduct flights at 400 feet (120 metres) or
below and in 'visual meteorological conditions,' according to
the FAA's certificate.

The drone operators must also have a private pilots' license
and current medical certification.

Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos wants to use drones -
small unmanned aircraft - to deliver packages as part of a
program dubbed 'Prime Air.' 

The company is developing drones
that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour (80 kph), operate
autonomously and sense and avoid objects.

Amazon sought permission from the FAA to test drones in
outdoor areas near Seattle, where one of its research and
development labs is working on the technology. 

The company has
conducted test flights outside the United States, in countries
with looser restrictions.

In February, the FAA proposed long-awaited rules to try to 
set universal guidelines for drones, addressing growing interest
from both individual and corporations in using unmanned aerial
vehicles. 

The draft rules, nearly 10 years in the making, still
must undergo public comment and revision before becoming final,
a process expected to take at least a year.

Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It has previously threatened to take its testing outside the US.

'In the absence of a timely approval by the FAA to conduct outdoor testing, we have begun utilizing outdoor testing facilities outside the United States,' Amazon vice president Paul Misener said in a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration.

'These non-US facilities enable us to quickly build and modify our Prime Air vehicles as we construct new designs and make improvements,' he said.
