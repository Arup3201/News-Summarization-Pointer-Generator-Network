A U.S. warship has been damaged after it collided with a fully-loaded oil tanker in the early hours of Sunday morning close to the politically sensitive Strait of Hormuz.

The collision left a gaping hole in the starboard side of USS Porter but no one was injured on either vessel, the U.S. Navy said in a statement.

Japanese-owned bulk oil tanker M/V Otowasan and the guided-missile destroyer hit each other at around 1am local time. They both pulled up in in the sea as engineers made frantic efforts to secure the damage.

Investigations were continuing this morning into how the two ships came to collide in an area of sea that has been the focus on intense political tensions between Iran and the west.

Darkness: The collision happened in the middle of the night but was not combat related, officials say

However, officials said that the crash was not combat related. Radar failure, human error or engine malfunction are all possible explanations for the incident.

The sonar equipment used on the U.S. ship is likely to be far more advanced than that used on the oil tanker, raising the possibility that the oil ship struck the naval boat.

The cause of the incident is under investigation, the Navy said, adding that there were no reports of spills or leakages from either the USS Porter or the Otowasan.

'Both vessels are okay and the Strait of Hormuz is not closed, and business is as usual there," an Oman coastguard official said.

The USS Porter is on a scheduled deployment to the U.S. 5th Fleet, which is based in Bahrain.

The oil tanker, owned by Japan's Mitsui OSK, was bound for the United Arab Emirates port of Fujairah from Mesaieed in Qatar, according to ship tracking websites.

It can hold two million barrels of oil and was understood to be 95 per cent full at the time of the smash.

The Strait of Hormuz, located at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, is where one-fifth of the world's oil is routed.

The area was at the centre of tough 
negotiations earlier this year as Iran threatened to blockade the 
passage in a row over U.S. sanctions imposed on the country, due to its 
nuclear programme.

Tensions
 have risen there over Iran's threats to block tanker traffic in 
retaliation for tighter sanctions by the West. Washington says it 
maintains naval forces in the Gulf to ensure security in the region.

If attacked, Iran could severely disrupt oil supplies and send the shaky global economy stumbling backward again.

Three years ago, the USS Hartford, a nuclear-powered submarine based in Groton, Connecticut, collided in the Strait with the USS New Orleans, a San Diego-based amphibious ship.

The New Orleans' fuel tank was ruptured and 15 sailors on the Hartford sustained minor injuries.

The collision caused $2.3 million in damage to the New Orleans, and the cost so far of repairs to the Hartford is $102.6 million.

The commanding officer was relieved of his duties and the sub's chief of the boat, an adviser to the commanding officer, was reassigned. Several crew members were punished.
