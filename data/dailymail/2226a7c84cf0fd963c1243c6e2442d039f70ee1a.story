Divorce is no longer seen as a social taboo in the UK, a study has found.

Nearly two thirds of people now do not think there is a stigma attached to ending a marriage as attitudes towards divorce have become more relaxed.

Only 4 per cent of British people questioned said they strongly agreed that divorce is a social taboo.

But who gets which half? Nearly two thirds of people now do not think there is a stigma attached to ending a marriage as attitudes towards divorce have become more relaxed, a new survey has shown

The research into the changing attitudes towards marriage found that it is young people who are now mostly likely to believe that divorce is socially acceptable.

Only 56 per cent of people aged 18 to 24 said that divorce was taboo, compared to 67 per cent of 24- to 54-year-olds.

The poll of 2,000 people by YouGov for the DVD release of film I Give It A Year found that the words people most associated with marriage were commitment (37 per cent) and love (20 per cent).

Only 4 per cent of people said that the word they most associated with marriage was divorce.

The study further found that 28 is considered the best age to get married.

Relationship expert and Relate 
counsellor Christine Northam said: ‘Divorce has become much more 
familiar in modern life; it’s not the hushed secret it was years ago.

'Most
of us have been affected by divorce, whether we’ve gone through it, 
know someone who has, or have been affected by our parents’ divorce, so 
the taboo status has lost much of its power.

‘The
generational difference in attitude could be put down to the young 
couples’ proximity to parental divorce, and an unwillingness to repeat 
the same mistakes.

'Perhaps we don't put the value on it that we did': Actress Alison Steadman recently said that the stigma of divorce is now a thing of the past

'I see a lot of younger couples anxious to try fix a relationship, but there are still vast numbers of couples who give up on marriage too quickly before seeking professional help.

‘It’s a common myth that marriage is losing its sense of importance in society, in fact it stills means an awful lot to many, many people, hence, the huge fuss which is made around weddings.

'There is no such thing as a painless divorce; we are just getting better adjusted to it as a part of modern Britain.’

The findings come after TV actress Alison Steadman said that the stigma of divorce is now a thing of the past.

The 66-year old said: ‘I can remember when I was at school there was one girl in my whole class, her parents were divorced and it was shocking, we as kids felt really sorry for her ... her mother had married again and it felt really odd.

‘I think now it seems to be the norm for kids that their parents don't stay together, sadly.

‘But times change and hopefully, maybe my sons' generation, there will be a switch again, maybe they will think again.

‘Because divorce is so easy now and it wasn't years ago and you had to go through all sorts of hoops. It was incredibly complicated, now it's just a question of saying “that's it”.

‘Perhaps we don't put the value on it that we did, I don't know.’

The actress married Mike Leigh in 1973 and split up with him in 1995 when she left him for actor Michael Elwyn.
