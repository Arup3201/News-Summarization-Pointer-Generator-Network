The teenage son of the main investigator in the murder case against Jodi Arias has died in a Boy Scout ziplining activity.

Tony Flores, 15, from Phoenix, died after from a head trauma after hitting a tree  while using a zip-line east of Payson, Arizona, on Saturday morning. 

Larry Abbott, the CEO of the Grand Canyon Council of the Boy Scouts of America, told 3TV: 'I guess four of the boys decided they were going to hop on the zip line while the adults were in getting the equipment and the bungees are part of that braking system at the end.'

'And so the first boy who went down struck a tree at the end of the zip line because that braking system was not on it. 

'At that point, another adult ran inside and got the other adults that were getting the equipment and they came out and administered CPR and then called 911 right away.' 

He said the teenager was pronounced dead at the Payson Medical Center.

Tony was the son of Mesa Police Detective Esteban Flores, who has been a key witness in the Jodi Arias murder trial.

Coconino County Sheriff's Spokesman Gerry Blair said his department is investigating.

'Any death like that is devastating, not just to the victim, but to the victim's family and to the people who are around him, so certainly it's very unfortunate that it occurred,' he told KPHO.
