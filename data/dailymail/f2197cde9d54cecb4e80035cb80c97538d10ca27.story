One run has ended and another continued, but only Paul Lambert had cause to smile about this result.

Sam Allardyce was far more preoccupied with how this one got away, even if it did mean West Ham have now gone five matches unbeaten in this excellent season of personal vindication.

Make no mistake, this game was there for the taking for a free-scoring team who suddenly got the jitters in front of goal. Never was that more obvious than in the frenzied late stages of the second half.

Diafra Sakho, the Premier League player of the month for October, was guilty of one woeful header, Carl Jenkinson of another.

When Andy Carroll  came on in stoppage time for his first appearance of the season, he caused mayhem in the air. Of course he did. What an asset he could be in this attack if his fitness holds up, but even his headers could find no way past Brad Guzan.

‘The sad thing is that when our finishing was very good their goalkeeper was even better,’ Allardyce said. ‘Other times I was a little disappointed with the finishing, given how good it has been. We are a little frustrated and disappointed, but we couldn’t do any more. We have to respect the point.’

A point flattered Aston Villa and delighted Lambert, their manager. Six defeats in a row was their worst top-flight run since 1964. At least that streak has gone, even if the hard times show no obvious sign of ending.

‘It was a really great point,’ Lambert said. ‘Brad Guzan did what he is paid for. His save at the end was world class. He’s a top guy, a top pro.

‘We put our bodies on the line and it is a massive point for us. Credit to the team, they took a lot of stick at times.’

Indeed, it really has been a tough season for them, even if Lambert insisted confidence is good. He also felt Villa ‘looked a threat’ but in truth they were largely blunt, as they have been for much of the season. A return of five goals from 11 games is dire.

The harsh suspension picked up by Christian Benteke against Tottenham last week didn’t help, and the lack of accuracy early on by his replacement, Gabriel Agbonlahor, made matters worse.

To the striker’s credit, he created the 12th-minute opening that should have put Villa in front. But having sped past James Collins to go clear, his shot was hopelessly high. Who knows how significant those moments could be in the course of a season?

From there it was often an unrewarded West Ham blitz. Collins almost atoned for his flat-footed defending with a header that Guzan did well to save.

And Sakho then headed wide from an Aaron Cresswell cross. Stewart Downing, meanwhile, followed his England call-up with another impressive performance. Set-pieces, runs from deep, long passes and fine crosses — at 30 he is having a fine late-career revival.

He forced a save from Guzan after 24 minutes and moments later retreated deep into his own half to thread a 50-yard pass through a crowd and into Cresswell’s path. He closed the half with a poor shot, but that was the only blot on a day when the quality of his deliveries was sublime.

Allardyce said: ‘I think people forget how exciting it is to see crossing and heading.’

And Villa? Andreas Weimann shot straight at Adrian from a good position, but the sad truth is that their nearest miss came when Winston Reid overhit a backpass and Adrian’s touch let the ball run close to the line.

Villa looked tighter at the back in the initial stages of the second half but were battered in the final 15 minutes.

Somehow Guzan was able to make the saves that kept them from conceding.

Sakho’s 78th-minute miss was the worst. Carlton Cole’s delivery was perfect but Sakho’s free header wasn’t even on target. Sakho missed a second header soon after and Jenkinson’s attempt went straight to Guzan.

With that, Carroll was sent on in stoppage time. He is often maligned but his gifts are obvious. Twice he beat a swarm of markers to meet Downing crosses. Twice Guzan denied him.

Carroll needs a run of games; Villa will simply be pleased to have ended their run of defeats.
