Two teenagers who forced a mentally ill woman to drink urine and smoke a cannabis joint filled with curry power while filming it on their mobile phones have been jailed.

Jamie Rhys Campin, 19, was given ten years behind bars after he was also convicted of sexually assaulting the 43-year-old victim, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.

His accomplice, 19-year-old Connor James, was jailed for two years after he was also found guilty of helping to steal a ring and laptop worth £400 from the home in Hillingdon, Greater London.

Isleworth crown court heard that the victim was alone in her house one day between the July 5 and July 14 when Campin and James approached her front door.

The victim, who was suffering a psychotic episode, said she couldn't remember the exact date, and told the jury that she let the pair in because she convinced herself that she knew them.

She said: 'I was not one hundred per cent well at that time because I have a mental health problem and I did not have any control of the situation. They just walked in and I didn’t want any trouble.

'These people entered my house early, at seven or eight in the morning and I don’t understand why I let them in, in the first place. In my head I believed these people were friends of mine.

'I don’t understand why I didn’t throw them out. I was very vulnerable at the time.'

The victim, who also has an alcohol problem, was alone on that particular day after her husband left due to an argument.

She said a third man may also have been present, but she clearly remembered two of them going into her bathroom.  

James was found guilty of forcing the woman to smoke drugs and drink urine, and of stealing a laptop and ring worth £400. The pair had a history of planning and filming attacks on the mentally frail, a court heard

The victim, a 43-year-old married woman with paranoid schizophrenia, told Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) that she let the men in because 'in my head I believed these people were friends of mine'

She added: 'I remember them walking out with a plastic cup and they asked me to drink it and I drunk a bit and realised there was wee in it and spat it out.

'I was lured into my bedroom and I don’t remember being forced onto the mattress, but the person who assaulted me was on top of me.

'I was very scared at the time. I was confused and I do not know if it was sheer pure fright or if I was going along with it and not really knowing what was happening.

'I remember my trousers being undone. I don’t know if I did it or he did. I don’t think it was me, in fact I know it wasn’t.'

She told the court she was not sure if a second man was in the bedroom at the time, but said he had spent his time in her house: 'With his hands down the front of his trousers.'

The court heard that Campin and James both had histories of abusing mentally ill people, and had a history of planning such attacks and recording them.

Police investigating the incident later found footage of the woman being given a cannabis joint which had been laced with curry powder.
