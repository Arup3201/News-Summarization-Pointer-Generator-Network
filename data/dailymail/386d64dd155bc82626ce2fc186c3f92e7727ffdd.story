A man serving 26 years for a murder he claims he did not commit could possibly be set free if one high-profile attorney has her way.

Mario Casciaro, of Johnsburg, Illinois, was convicted last year in the 2002 killing of Brian Carrick, even though a body was never found and the prosecution admitted he never laid a finger on his victim.

Now, lawyer Kathleen Zellner thinks she has evidence that won't only set Casciaro free, but also reveal who killed Carrick.

Mario Casciaro is serving 26 years in prison for the murder of Brian Carrick

She revealed her new findings last night on an episode of 20/20. 

Casciaro and Carrick were both employees at Val's Grocery, the last place Carrick was ever seen alive on December 20, 2002.

His blood was found in the produce cooler at the grocery store, but no one was ever arrested or charged with his murder or disappearance.

Then, a story began to circulate that Casciaro was dealing drugs, and had Carrick working for him.

People started to say he had the boy killed over a debt of $400 to $500, including Carrick's father.

At this point the FBI was also investigating the death, but found no truth to any of these rumors.

Everything changed however in 2010, when Shane Lamb, who also worked with the boys at Val's, was arrested on cocaine charges.

He told prosecutor Michael Combs that Carrick did owe Casciaro money and he was called in to 'take care of him.'

Lamb says he punched the 17-year-old Carrick and knocked him out, killing him.

Casciaro then said he would take care of the body.

New evidence suggest that Casciaro might be set free

And so Casciaro was charged with first-degree murder with intimidation, while Lamb received no charges as part of his plea bargain and a reduced sentence for his cocaine charge.

Lamb is now saying he lied and was coerced by Combs. 

'I was following what [Combs] wanted me to say. They just wanted to close the case,' Lamb said.

He also claimed that Combs was determined to charge one of the two boys with murder.

'I was like, "If you, you know, you brought me into this. My family doesn’t have money to pay for a lawyer. They don’t have money to bond me out like yours does."' Lamb said he told Casciaro. “

'You know, I’m like, "They were trying to indict me for murder," and I’m like, "I didn’t have money to fight this case."'

Lamb, however, is not who Zellner thinks killed Carrick, but rather another young man working at the store with the boys - Rob Render.

Render's fingerprint was found in Carrick's blood splatter and one store employee, Jacob Kepple, says he saw the two boys fighting over drug money on the night he died.

'Brian had told Rob, "If you don't have it by Friday, it's 60,”' Kepple recalled.

'And to me, that meant, "If you don't have the $30 you owe me for weed by Friday, then it's double.”'

Render was also missing for almost two hours that night, between 5 pm and 7 pm, which is when Carrick disappeared. 

And there's more.

An employee later found underwear soiled with blood hidden in the ceiling of one of the store's bathrooms, underwear that was never tested for DNA or admitted as evidence in the trial.

Zellner is convinced that DNA will prove Render was the killer.

Render did not testify in the first trial, and died of a heroin overdose before Casciaro's second trial.

His first trial ended in a hung jury.

'The only person that really dislikes Brian Carrick is Render. The only person … that owes money to Brian Carrick is Render,' Zellner said. 

'The only person who's ever described wanting to jump him with a weapon is Render, and the only person in that back hallway is Render.'
