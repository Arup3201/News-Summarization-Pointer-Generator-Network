President Obama says his landmark visit to Myanmar is an acknowledgement of the democratic transition underway but not an endorsement of the country's government.

Obama's words were aimed at countering critics who say his trip to the country also known as Burma is premature. While Myanmar has undertaken significant reforms, hundreds of political prisoners are still detained and ethnic violence has displaced more than 100,000 people.

The President says his goal in visiting Myanmar is to highlight the steps the Asian nation still needs to take. He says he also wants to congratulate the people of Myanmar for having 'opened the door' to being a country that respects human rights and political freedom.

Obama spoke on Sunday during a news conference with Thailand's prime minister.

Barack Obama also said it is 'no accident' that he planned his first foreign trip to Asia after winning re-election.

Speaking at a news conference on 
Sunday in Bangkok, Obama emphasized that the United States is a 'Pacific
 nation'. He says the Asia-Pacific region will be crucial for creating 
jobs in the U.S. and shaping its security and prosperity.

Thailand is Obama's first stop on a three-day tour of Asia that will also take him to Myanmar and Cambodia.

Obama's praised Thailand for being a 
supporter of democracy in Myanmar, the once-pariah state that is rapidly
 reforming. He says he appreciated the Thai prime minister's insights 
into Myanmar during their meetings on Sunday.

While in Asia, however, Obama will be
 dividing his attention by monitoring the escalating conflict between 
Israel and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.

Obama has been in regular contact 
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as with Egyptian 
and Turkish leaders who might hold sway with the Hamas leadership.

Obama landed in Bangkok on Sunday afternoon, greeted by 40 saluting military guards who flanked both sides of a red carpet.

His schedule is packed with sightseeing, a royal audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a private meeting with Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, a joint press conference and an official dinner.

On a steamy day, Obama began with a visit to the Wat Pho Royal Monastery, a cultural must-see in Bangkok.

In stocking feet, the president and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton walked around a golden statue of a sitting Buddha. The complex is a sprawling display of buildings with colorful spires, gardens and waterfalls.

Obama joked with a monk at the monastery that he hoped praying would help his administration reach a deal on the budget.

At his news conference with PM Shinawatra, Obama said: 'I always believe in prayer. If a Buddhist monk is wishing me well, Iâ€™m going to take whatever good vibes he can give me to try to deal with some challenges back home.'

Obama is also visiting Myanmar and Cambodia in his first trip abroad since winning a second term.

The visit to Thailand, less than 18 hours long, is a gesture of friendship to a long-standing partner and major non-NATO ally.

Still,
 the two countries have faced strains, most recently after the 2006 
military coup that deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and 
Obama's visit offers an opportunity to restate and broaden the 
relationship.

'It was very important for us to send a signal to the region that allies are going to continue to be the foundation of our approach' to establishing a more prominent presence in Asia, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters traveling with the president aboard Air Force One.

Obama is also seeking to open new markets for U.S. businesses; the United States is Thailand's third biggest trading partner, behind China and Japan. Becoming a counterweight to China in the region is a keystone of Obama's so-called pivot to the Asia-Pacific region.

Obama's trip comes on the heels of meetings in Thailand between Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and his Thai counterparts on security and military cooperation on issues ranging from fighting weapons proliferation to disaster relief to countering piracy.

Alluding to the 2006 coup, Obama's 
national security adviser, Tom Donilon, said in a speech ahead of the 
trip last week that Obama would build on Panetta's outreach to reinforce
 the relationship and 'support the continued peaceful restoration of 
democratic order after a turbulent period.'

After his time at the temple, Obama paid a courtesy call to the ailing, 84-year-old U.S.-born King Bhumibol Adulyadej in his hospital quarters. The king, the longest serving living monarch, was born in Cambridge, Mass., and studied in Europe.

The centerpiece of the Asia trip comes Monday when Obama travels to Myanmar, the once reclusive and autocratic state that has begun instituting democratic measures. Obama has eased sanction on the country, also known as Burma, and his visit will be the first there by a sitting U.S. president.

Obama aides see Myanmar as not only a success story but also as a signal to other countries that the U.S. will reward democratic behavior.

'If Burma can continue to succeed in a democratic transition, then that can potentially send a powerful message regionally and around the world...that if countries do take the right decisions, we have to be there with incentives,' Rhodes said.
