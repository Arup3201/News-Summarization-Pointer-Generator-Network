A self-styled Lord who was released from prison as an ‘act of mercy’ when he convinced judges he was gravely ill is clearly enjoying life as a free man.

Edward Davenport, nicknamed ‘Fast Eddie’, was jailed for eight years in 2011 for masterminding a £4.5million fraud where he hoodwinked the rich and famous.

Last May he was released early after claiming he was 'at death's door' because of kidney problems and suffering the 'ordeal' of having to leave prison each week for life-saving dialysis.

But eight months on socialite Davenport looks to be close to a full recovery as he had fun with a friend on Saturday.

New life: Eight months after being released from prison on health grounds Edward 'Fast Eddie' Davenport is seen here kissing a friend on Saturday 

He was seen kissing and hugging an unnamed woman as they walked through central London.

As a property developer and party organiser he  made millions and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry.

His £30million home, a mansion in London’s West End, was the former Sierra Leone High Commission and was used as a location for the Oscar-winning film The King’s Speech. 

But the socialite was ruined when he was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes and jailed - only for his health to falter.

Last year he was pictured handcuffed to a prison guard in hospital after undergoing a second kidney transplant.

He said at the time: ‘I know I’m fighting a death sentence. 

‘I feel like an old man shuffling around, chained to a prison officer even when I want to go to the bathroom.

'I can’t even wear my own silk pyjamas – I have to wear the hospital ones. The truth is I feel shaky. I know I’m at death’s door'. 

Fall from grace: Davenport was one of London's richest and most popular socialites until he was convicted of a multi-million pound fraud and later required a second kidney transplant

Judges agreed to his plea for clemency and cut his sentence by a year to allow him to be released early after serving around three years. 

Davenport's fall from grace is a far cry from his days at the heart of the London party scene in the 1980s. 

His black-tie Gatecrasher Balls, aimed at wealthy public school teenagers, quickly became synonymous with drunkenness and debauchery and helped him make his fortune.

But it also led to his first fraud conviction and nine months in jail.

Despite the setback, Davenport never lost his love of taking risks – even though it repeatedly landed him in trouble. 

In 1998, he and two other men were charged with running up an £18,000 bill at the luxury Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland during a five-day New Year party while posing as aristocrats. They denied the claims and charges were later dropped.

A year later, he bought the lease of the Sierra Leone High Commission building in Central London for just £50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war.  

The property is said to be worth £30 million and was used to film scenes for the Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech. 

But in May 2011 Davenport was given eight years for his part in a £4.5 million fraud. The judge described him as the ‘ringmaster’ who was careful not to leave ‘footprints in the snow.’

Recovery: A year ago the fraudster was getting treatment in hospital in south London where he had to be accompanied by prison officers an handcuffed to his chair

The con artist, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds to investors which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. 

Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel lost the life savings she invested with Davenport.

After his latest conviction  a defective kidney failed and meant he needed repeated visits to hospital - where he was handcuffed to his bed while undergoing treatment.

Last March his sentence was reduced to six years and eight months by judges at London’s Criminal Appeal Court, who said that, although there was nothing wrong with his original punishment, it should be reduced as an act of mercy and meant he could be freed two months later.
