Jailed: Bogus charity collector Thomas Richards was jailed for a year after spending £2,000 collected for Help for Heroes instead of donating it to the organisation

A bogus charity collector who stole £2,000 of donations meant for injured soldiers and spent it on a drinking and gambling spree has been jailed for 12 months.

Thomas Richards signed up as a street collector for the Help for Heroes charity and collected from donors in Oxford town centre for two months.

But instead of passing the money onto the charity, Richards spent the cash himself, using some of it to fund nights at a luxury four star hotel.

He was only caught when a police officer who was aware of Richards's criminal past saw him with a donation tin and became suspicious.

Judge Mary Jane Mowat said that the 27-year-old, who had 45 previous convictions, should never have been allowed to collect for Help for Heroes and questioned the charity's 'ramshackle' process for vetting volunteers.

She said: 'The truth of the matter is that you have been a life-long offender, somebody who should never have been let loose with a collection tin.'

Although the judge did criticise the process of recruiting volunteers, with more than 400 people signing up to help the charity every week she conceded that she understood why proper vetting was not possible.

Oxford Crown Court heard that Richards signed up as a street collector in January 2011.

He even raised money for a charity bike ride from Cape Wrath in Scotland to Land's End, a task described by the judge as 'fanciful' and spent more than £1,000 on a new bicycle and accessories.

He is also said to have lied to a member of the public that he was on compassionate leave from the Army after serving in 'the Far East'.

He was caught out when Police constable Steven Higa saw him collecting in Cornmarket Street, Oxford and became suspicious because he knew his record.

PC Higa said: 'The vast majority of the collectors are trustworthy and pass the money on, it is just a very small minority who take advantage of the goodwill and generosity of the public.

Richard Lister, defending, said Richards was not 'somebody who thinks through the consequences of his actions' and was now disgusted with what he had done.

Speaking after the sentence Corporal Tom Neathway, who lost both legs and an arm in a Taliban bomb blast, said: 'It is totally disrespectful. Help for Heroes was set up to help wounded soldiers.

'He has not shown respect for us, fighting for our country.'

Help for Heroes spokesman David Fraser added: 'It is unforgivable that someone might attempt to gain personally from donations given generously by the public to support the wounded.

'Anyone authorised by Help for Heroes to do a street collection must carry their fundraising certificate and each collection is followed up by our dedicated team.

Supportive: Richards registered to collect funds for the charity which helps injured soldiers in January 2011

'Our rigorous processes ensure that if someone attempts to defraud that charity, we catch them, report them to the police and push for prosecution.

'This one incident undermines the thousands of generous and committed fundraisers across the UK.'

Help for Heroes was launched in 2007 to raise money for British servicemen and women wounded in the line of duty.

It tries to pay for better facilities and support services to help those injured and their families, as well as supporting other charities.
