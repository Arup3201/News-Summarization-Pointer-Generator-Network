Butlins today unveiled its largest investment to date in the shape of a £25m high-tech hotel.

The size of a cruise ship, the Wave Hotel and Apartments in Bognor Regis boasts a litany of up-to-the-minute add-ons the holiday camp chiefs have designed specifically with pre-teens in mind. 

That means that along with the usual swimming pools, discos and dining rooms, there is a high-tech games room equipped with all the latest technology, a stash of iMac computers, PS3s and hundreds of iPod docking stations throughout the property.

And if the pre-teens Butlins hopes to charm can tear themselves away from the futuristic Games Port, there's a fully stocked Kindle library too - and a whole host of the latest DVD titles.

The children's rooms have an underwater theme, designed to look like submarine cabins, complete with octopus murals and cabin beds with built-in televisions.

Tween fans of science fiction will no doubt delight at the concept walls, that transform into 3D scenes with a special app.

It is the first time that Butlins 
has created a development with a mix of self-catering apartments and hotel rooms.

They are calling the 215 room, 26 apartment hotel the company's 'most significant investment since Sir Billy Butlin set up camp in 1936'.

Actress Angela Griffin took her daughters Tallulah, eight, and Melissa, five, to give it the once over - and they deemed it a success.

Angela says: 'Butlins and Wave are what holiday memories are made of – there are surprises around every corner.

'We’re a busy family, so it’s great to come to a place that gives us the chance to have fun and spend quality time together – and it’s not just the girls who love all the gadgets at Wave – I’ve definitely given them a run for their money in the Games Port.'

Mike Crowther, Butlins Operations Director, said: 'British families are busier than ever, so we’re always looking at new and innovative ways to help families spend time together.  We also know that pleasing everyone on holiday can be a tricky task – but we’re confident that we’ve cracked it with our state-of-the-art tween hotel.'

The hotel has already received pre-booking sales worth more than £2 million, which Butlins believe highlights a surge in demand for 'high-spec, flexible accommodation' that gets the children’s seal of approval.

Prices at Wave Hotel and Apartments start from £295 for an Octopus room, based on two adults and two children up to 14 sharing on a room-only basis for three nights in July. The price includes access to many facilities including sports coaching, funfair, Splash Waterworld and all live entertainment.
