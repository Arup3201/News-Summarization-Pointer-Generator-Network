Celebrities around the UK are uniting to help raise awareness of Down’s syndrome.

Photographer Terry Harris, 46, is travelling the length of the country asking famous people to pose with a poster of his six-year-old daughter Lucy.  

Mr Harris told the MailOnline he's not interested in money for his photos, he just wants to raise awareness of his daughter's condition.

A photographer has snapped a wide array of celebrities, including Peter Andre (pictured) holding an image of his daughter to raise awareness of World Down Syndrome Day

The 46-year-old from Peterborough regularly takes photos of celebrities as part of his job.

He took the first photo when Lord Coe visited his hometown for the Olympic Torch Relay in July 2012.

Since then he has captured the likes of Peter Andre, Michael Owen, Kirstie Allsopp, Tom Daley, Kara Tointon and more.

He also checks the web for nearby book signings and similar events, at which he can meet the celebrities.

So far, Mr Harris has photographed more than 100 famous people and has set up a Facebook page, called DS. The BIG Picture.

'I started taking the pictures to raise awareness of Down’s syndrome. My daughter Lucy was recently in hospital for eight weeks and I posted a small collage of her with some of the celebrities holding the poster on the Facebook page.' 

It got more than 18,000 ‘likes’ on the social network.

The 46-year-old photographer said one of his favourite photos is of Olympic Silver Medal Winner Zara Phillips, pictured. He said it was 'a bit of a coup' getting someone related to the Queen to be so supportive

The collage features Lucy in the centre holding an autographed picture of Rupert Everett. This was surrounded by images of cricketer Freddie Flintoff, singer David Essex, actress Sheila Hancock and Zara Phillips.

The release of the pictures coincides with World Down Syndrome Day (WDSD) which is a global event officially observed by the United Nations since 2012. 

It encourages people to take part in meetings and events to celebrate the day and is campaigning to improve the rights, inclusion and health of people who have the condition.

As well as taking photos of celebrities as part of his job as a photographer, Mr Harris also checks the web for local book signings and other events where he can meet famous people, such as The Only Way Is Essex star Chloe Sims, pictured

'Lord Coe was one of my favourite celebrities because he was the first,' continued Mr Harris.

'Taking Zara Phillips' photo was also a bit of a coup because she's royalty. The most recent photo I took was of Warwick Davis in his play See "How They Run" in Bromley this February.

'I also gave Bobby Davro a lift after I took his photo.'

A heart-warming video featuring children with Down’s syndrome has been released to reassure expectant parents.

The video, which was launched on YouTube for WDSD has been viewed more than a million times in less than a week.

The film was created by Saatchi & Saatchi for CoorDown - the Italian Coordinator of the National Association of People with Down's syndrome.

Mr Harris said: 'I started taking the pictures to raise awareness of Down's syndrome. My daughter Lucy was recently in hospital for eight weeks and I posted a small collage of her with some of the celebrities holding the poster on the Facebook page.' It got more than 18,000 'likes' on the social network

The release of the pictures, such as this one of cricketer Freddie Flintoff, coincides with World Down Syndrome Day (WDSD) which is a global event officially observed by the United Nations since 2012

It features a group of 15 young adults and children from across Europe all of whom have Down’s syndromes.

The actors involved in the film include Sarah Gordy who has Down's syndrome and who appeared in BBC1's Call The Midwife on February 16.

They each share a tear-jerking message which is aimed at a mother-to-be who has just learned her baby has the genetic condition.
