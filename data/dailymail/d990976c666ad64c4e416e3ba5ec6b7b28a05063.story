ESPN SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott, who is fighting a recurrence of cancer first diagnosed seven years ago, was awarded the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the ESPY Awards.

He gave an inspirational speech likely to be remembered for years to come that finished with an emotional embrace with his youngest daughter and a touching message to the audience: 'Have a great rest of your night and have a great rest of your life.'

Mr Scott was presented the award on Wednesday at a packed Nokia Theater in Los Angeles by Kiefer Sutherland shortly after a film had been shown documenting his battle.

His speech began with a thank you for Mr Sutherland, whose TV show 24, he admitted, was his favorite.

He then reminded the audience of a line spoken by Jim Valvano that he described as ‘the most poignant words ever uttered in a speech anywhere’.

The former North Carolina State University basketball coach created The V Foundation for Cancer Research with ESPN in 1993 and gave a legendary speech at the first ever ESPYs, two months before he died of bone cancer, in which he said: ‘Don’t give up… don’t ever give up.’

Those words became the foundation’s motto and Mr Scott said: ‘To be honored with this, I know I have a responsibility to never give up. I'm not special. I just listened to what the man said.’

He said the V Foundation had 'tangible benefits' which helped him, and ‘thousands like him’.

'Live, fight like hell,' he said. 'And when you're too tired to fight, lay down and rest and let someone else fight for you. That's also very important. I can't do this "don't give up thing" all by myself. I've got thousands of people on Twitter and on the streets who encourage me.'

Emotional Mr Scott asked his youngest daughter, Sydni, to give him a hug on stage at the end of his speech

He described how he had recently 'crashed' with kidney failure.

He revealed: ‘I had tubes running through every part of my body! As of Sunday, I didn't even know if I could make it here. I couldn't fight. But the doctors and nurses could, the people that I loved and my friends and family, they could. This whole fight, this journey thing, is not a solo venture, this is something that requires support.’

Mr Scott further emphasized  how important his friends, family and colleagues have been in his fight against cancer.

He marvelled at the fact that his bosses will offer to bring him food when he’s had chemotherapy and expressed his gratitude to family members who he would sometimes ring just because ‘he needed to cry’.

Parts of the speech received applause, with many people in tears at times.

Mr Scott saved his most heartfelt thanks for his daughters, Taelor and Sydni. His voice charged with emotion, he said that they were the reason he was standing on the stage and ‘being dad to them would be the best thing he would ever do’.

It ended when he invited Sydni on stage for a hug, which brought the audience to its feet.
