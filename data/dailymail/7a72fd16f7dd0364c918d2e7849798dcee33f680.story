A senior Iranian cleric made a vow to 'raise the flag of Islam over the White House' in retaliation for an attack that did not involved American troops.

Ali Shirazi, an aide to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nation's supreme leader, reportedly made the threat in comments published by the nation's feared Revolutionary Guard.

He said the takeover of Washington would be part of a 'resistance front' led by Iranians in revenge for the deaths of its soldiers, and members of the militant group Hezbollah.

New flag? Shirazi conjured an image of an Iranian-led 'resistance front' that would overwhelm the West

The men were reportedly killed by Israeli attack helicopters in the Golan Heights, which contains the border between Syria and Israel.

According to the Jerusalem Post, Shirazi was speaking at a ceremony for the dead guardsmen.

He said: 'The resistance front led by Iran would retaliate from the global arrogance of killing [Iranians] and Hezbollah men... we will raise the flag of Islam over the White House'.

The Jerusalem Post reported that the men killed in the chopper attack were establishing a terror base from which to bombard Israel with rocket fire.

Although the U.S. appears to have had no role in the attack, it is often mentioned in the same breath as Israel because of its financial and diplomatic support for the nation. 

Similar: ISIS press officer Abu Mosa made similar claims last year - but was killed by an air strike soon after

His words echo similar threats made by ISIS, even though Iran is at war with the terror group.

In behind-the-front-lines footage obtained by Vice News last year, Islamic State press office Abu Mosa can be seen making the exact same boast to the camera during a battle with Syrian soldiers.

He said: ‘I say to America that the Islamic Caliphate has been established and we will not stop. Don’t be cowards and attack us with drones.

‘Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq. We will humiliate them everywhere, God willing. And we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.’

However, just a few weeks after the video aired, it was reported that Mosa had been killed in an air strike by Syrian forces.
