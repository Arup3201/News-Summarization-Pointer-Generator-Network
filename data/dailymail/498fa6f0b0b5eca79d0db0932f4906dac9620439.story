Jacoby Jones may face 300-pound tacklers on the field for his job, but it was a stripper named Sweet Pea  who did the most damage this morning.

According to a report by TMZ, the Baltimore Ravens wide receiver and former Dancing with the Stars competitor was injured in a party bus brawl.

Jones and other teammates were out celebrating the birthday of offensive tackler Bryant McKinnie in Washington, DC when the injury occurred.

The group had just left Opera Ultra Lounge around 3am when they boarded the party bus.

Sources told the site that at least one stripper was on board.

The stripper named 'Sweet Pea' smashed an Ace of Spades bottle of champagne across Jones' head and he started 'bleeding everywhere'.

Some of Jones' friends tried to get back at Sweet Pea, but McKinnie stood up for her and started a fight with one of the friends.

An ambulance was called to treat 'a bleeding male' but Jones was not taken to the hospital.

While there was evidence of an assault, police made no arrests since none of the party cooperated.

This latest injury is another blow for Jones. He hasn't played since week one due to a sprained right knee. 

Jones competed in season 16 of Dancing with the Stars which aired last spring.
