Ukraine's football federation has called on FIFA and UEFA to suspend Russia from international football over the Crimea crisis.

UEFA has already ruled that it will not recognize the results of three clubs from Crimea, the region in Ukraine annexed by Russia in March, who have moved to play in Russian domestic competitions.

But Ukrainian federation president Anatoliy Konkov, who didn't sanction the Crimean clubs moving, called on FIFA to suspend Russia from world football claiming it 'seriously violates its obligations.'

Andre Villas Boas' club Zenit St Petersburg would be kicked out of the Champions League under any ban

Any suspension would prevent national and club teams from taking part in international matches.

In a letter to FIFA President Sepp Blatter and UEFA President Michel Platini, Konkov says the Russians are 'ignoring the basic principles of the football family,' decrying the 'howling infringement' of Ukrainian football.

The Russian team, who Ukraine want banned from international football, are managed by Fabio Capello

Russia are a regular at European championships and World Cups but a ban would bring an end to that
