Cleared: Billy Murray thanked magistrates today after he was cleared of a speeding charge

Actor Billy Murray is used to appearing in court from his time in The Bill, but today he was the one making the defence.

The 71-year-old, who also starred in Eastenders, was acquitted by magistrates after magistrates accepted his claim that he was not driving the vehicle.

However, it remains a mystery who was driving his Ford Transit van when it was caught on camera traveling at 51mph in a 40mph zone in Laindon, Essex, this February.

He admitted that he was in the habit of leaving a key inside the van underneath a floor mat so that other people could move it.

During the hearing he told magistrates that he could not admit speeding as it would be a 'lie', since he was not driving at the time.

Mr Murray, who represented himself, said: 'I used to leave the key under the mat in the van so it could be moved because it was often in the way.'

After asking nine people who live in the area whether they had seen anything, he was still left none the wiser, the court heard.

Before leaving the court today, Mr Murray made a point of telling justices: 'Thank you and have a Merry Christmas'.

Outside the building after the trial, he said: 'I'd like to say thanks to the court for seeing it my way.'

He was found not guilty of failing to give information relating to the driver of the Ford Transit and the prosecution withdrew the speeding accusation.
