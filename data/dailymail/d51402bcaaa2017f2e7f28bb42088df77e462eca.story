By ’eck it were steep.

But even 40 years after Carl Barlow first pushed his baker’s-boy bike up the dauntingly mountainous hill, he couldn’t resist doing it again for old time’s sake.

And so, with a full basket of bread – and a considerable amount of middle-age huff and puff – he donned his cloth cap and set off up the most famous cobbled street in TV advertising.

Carl Barlow has returned to the scene of the Hovis advert on Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset, after 40 years

The advert was filmed 40 years ago and has become one of the most famous scenes in British TV history

The voiceover for the advert is provided by the delivery boy who is now grown up.

He is reminiscing about his days as a youngster when he did his bread round.

To the sound of a brass band playing Dvorak's New World Symphony, he states: 'Last stop on round would be Old Ma Peggoty's place.

'T'was like taking bread to top of the world.

'T'was a grand ride back though. I'd knew baker have kettle on and doorsteps of old Hovis ready.

'"There's wheatgearm in that loaf," he'd day.

"Get it inside you boy and you'll be going up that hill as fast as you come down.'"

The boy is seen in the advert struggling to push his bike to the top of the hill but is sat astride it and joyously freewheeling down it after making the delivery.

He is then seen returning to the bakery and tucking into Hovis bread.

The Hovis delivery lad was back in 
business. Not to recreate the nation’s best-loved ad though, but as a 
celebrity invited to turn on a town’s Christmas lights.

He
 was 13 and at stage school in 1973 when he first scaled the hill to 
star in a  commercial that earned itself a slice of British history.

The
 short film by Ridley Scott – now an Oscar-nominated Hollywood director –
 shows Carl slogging up the one-in-four gradient to a brass-band 
soundtrack of Dvorak’s New World symphony, set against the backdrop of a
 fictional northern industrial town.

Fictional,
 because it was actually filmed on picturesque Gold Hill in Shaftesbury,
 Dorset, one of the steepest residential streets in Britain and hundreds
 of miles from the grime and belching smoke of a bygone age up North.

It
 showed Carl with a pudding basin haircut beneath a flat cap, struggling
 with  the fully laden bike to deliver a loaf to Old Ma Peggoty’s house 
at the top of the hill.

In triumph, he then freewheels down at breakneck speed with his legs splayed out from the pedals.

The advert won a clutch of accolades and was voted more than three decades later as Britain’s all-time favourite.

Mr Barlow was invited back to the West Country village this week to turn on its Christmas lights

Although
 he was paid handsomely for his endeavours (£60), he did not go on to 
make the big time, preferring instead to earn his crust as a fireman.

He recently retired from London Fire Brigade after a 30-year career.

But the people of Shaftesbury never forgot the young lad who helped to put Gold Hill on the tourist map.

On Monday they afforded him VIP status to switch on the festive lights, and yesterday he recalled his moment of stardom.

Mr Barlow said: 'The advert has been such a big part of my life and it really captured the hearts of the nation'

‘Three
 boys were auditioned,’ he said. ‘One couldn’t ride a bike, one wasn’t 
prepared to cut his hair, and I was happy to do both.

‘It was cold, but I soon warmed up – I had to push the bike up the hill many times for the best part of two days filming.’

He admitted that doing it again was more of a slog at the age of 54.

Surely going downhill was fun though? ‘I wouldn’t even consider doing it now,’ he said. ‘It’s far too steep.’
