Shocking: Cynthia Bell, 66, was stabbed with a pen by a thug while on a day out at the seaside

A 66-year-old wife was stabbed with a pen by a thug while on a day out at the seaside.

Cynthia Bell, whose husband runs a coach tour firm, was waiting alone on the bus in Blackpool, when two women and a man climbed on board.

The mother-of-two, from County Durham, was left terrified and protected her face with her arms when the man plunged the pen deep into her right arm, narrowly missing her vital arteries.

Retired administration worker Mrs Bell was left in agony on the coach as the thugs fled from the scene. She was given gas and air as paramedics prised the pen from her arm - leaving her with a nasty wound and severe bruising.

She said: ‘I decided to go with (my husband) Norman on the trip to Blackpool and we’d pulled over while waiting for passengers. We had the engine running so we could keep the air conditioning on because it was a really hot day.

‘Then I saw these three people walking on and I honestly thought they were going to steal the bus - it was absolutely frightening. The man came up to me so I lifted my arms up to protect myself but he stabbed me with the pen. It went right through my skin and narrowly missed my vital arteries. If it had been an inch further up or down who knows what would have happened?’

The thugs ran off empty-handed as Mrs Bell was left in agony on the coach for 15 minutes while waiting for paramedics to arrive. Mr Bell, 69, has been running Bell Brothers coaches for 42 years - and his wife only went on the trip to enjoy a day out.

She said: ‘It was a really bizarre 
attack. They just shouted at me then the man grabbed the pen and stabbed
 me with it. It was incredibly painful and it was very sore for days 
after it was taken out.

‘I just hope the police manage to track these thugs down before they do anything else.’

In a later interview, Mrs Bell said from her home in Spennymoor: ‘The picture is horrible but it could have been worse. It was lucky that it missed all the veins and didn't do any internal damage.

‘At the moment it is still scabbed and scarred but I hope it will be fine.’

Officers are now on the hunt for the three thugs and are calling for anyone with information about the attack, on August 24 at about 5pm, to come forward.

DS Mark Dickinson from Blackpool CID said: ‘As you can see from Mrs Bell’s photograph, significant force must have been used by offender who stabbed her.

‘She was lucky to have escaped without serious blood loss or any nerve damage. We are pursuing a number of lines of enquiry including CCTV and forensic opportunities.

'It went right through my skin and narrowly missed my vital arteries. If it had been an inch further up or down who knows what would have happened?'

‘I am particularly keen to identify and speak with two young women who were with the offender and I would ask them, or anyone who recognises them from their descriptions, to contact me as soon as possible.’

The male offender is described as being white, 6ft, of stocky build and in his late teens or early twenties with short dark hair.

Police described one of the women as a white female who was wearing a pink top with a floral pattern. She was said to be pushing a pram or pushchair and walked with a limp.

The other woman was described as having blonde hair, wearing a cream jumper and had a tattoo on the right side of her lower stomach.
