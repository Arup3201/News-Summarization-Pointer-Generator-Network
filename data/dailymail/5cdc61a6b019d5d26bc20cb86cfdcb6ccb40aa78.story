The poster for play, Bad Jews, which has been banned by London Underground 

Adverts for a Jewish play which received five-star reviews in one of the religion's newspapers have been banned from the London Underground because they 'could cause offence'.

Transport for London (TfL) decided that posters of Joshua Harmon's acclaimed production, Bad Jews, contravened its policy following an investigation by an advertising regulator.

The poster for the comedy, which is about a family brought together after the death of their Holocaust-survivor grandfather, shows four characters in a quarrel on the floor.

One complaint was made to the the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) during the play's first campaign, but the regulator concluded that the poster did not breach rules.

However, TfL disagreed with the ASA's ruling and told the Evening Standard it would not clarify the precise reason for the rejection.

A TfL spokesperson said in a statement: 'The advert "Bad Jews" was previously displayed on our network as our advertising contractor approved it without consulting us. 

'It was subsequently submitted for display again and has been rejected as it contravened our advertising policy, which states that adverts will not be approved if they may cause widespread or serious offence.' 

Producer Danny Moar has blasted TfL's decision, saying it seemed like 'censorship', despite the play winning a five-star review for the Jewish Chronicle. 

He told the paper: 'Half the cast are Jewish, I'm Jewish, the writer is Jewish and the word "bad" in the title, in so far as it matters, doesn't mean "evil" — it means "non-observant".

'This is a form of censorship which is so weird and ironic when, in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo events, everyone marched against censorship.'

The play is about three cousins who have had to come together after the death of their Holocaust-survivor grandfather. It involves rows and quarrels between the family members, told in a hilarious comedy

★★★★ ‘Exhilaratingly abrasive…A terrific family comedy’ Sunday Times

★★★★ ‘Ferociously clever…a visceral thrill’ Evening Standard

★★★★ ‘Hilariously, exquisitely edgy’ The Times

★★★★ ‘Scaldingly funny’ Daily Telegraph

★★★★ ‘Vivid, raw, brilliant.’Financial Times

★★★★ ‘Exquisitely hilarious’ Independent 

He admitted that the rejection shouldn't have too much of an impact on the show, but that they are being prevented from reaching as many people as possible.

The play is due to be transferred from the St James Theatre in Victoria to the Arts Theatre on March 18.

The transport company has previously rejected bus posters from Christian group, Core Issues Trust, which suggested gay people could be helped to change their sexuality. 

In a separate incident, Sainsburys removed all its kosher food from shelves in Holborn, central London, in August last year, over fears anti-Israeli protesters outside would attack it.

The transport company decided the advert could cause 'widespread offence' after an investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)

The poster was previously advertised and one complaint was received, but the advertising regulator said it did not breach their rules. However, TfL disagreed and decided it would ban the posters
