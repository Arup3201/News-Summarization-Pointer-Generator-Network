Andy Murray has been handed a relatively benign opening to his Wimbledon title defence with the draw proving more favourable than it initially looked twelve months ago.

The 27 year-old Scot was handed a first round against Belgian David Goffin, the world number 104 who might be mistaken for being the member of a boy band. He is a talented ball striker but has made his biggest career impression on clay.

Murray is in the same half as Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of an exhibition match to rest his troublesome wrist on Thursday, with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on the other side.

Champion: Andy Murray will start the defence of his Wimbledon title against Belgian David Goffin

The defending champion could have a major headache in the quarter finals where he might play last Sunday’s Aegon champion Grigor Dimitrov or the relentless Spanish scrapper David Ferrer.

Murray’s first expected seed in the third round is Spanish baseliner Roberto Bautista Agut, although it couldbe the in-form German Tobias Kamke instead. His scheduled fourth round opponent could be tough, the big-serving South African Kevin Anderson but overall it could have come out worse.

But he has managed to avoid some of the more nasty floating players in the early round, and may be pleased to have avoided his perennial semi-final nemesis Rafael Nadal before the final.

Of course there is much to happen before then and the Spaniard, who flopped in last year’s first round, has an opener this time against Slovak Martin Klizan. 

Nadal has the nastiest looking draw of the KBig Four' with a possible second round against his 2012 conqueror Lukas Rosoi and maybe a meeting after that with the massive serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic.

Federer has a potentially nasty second round against the athletic Frenchman Julien Benetteau, who has caused him problems at Wimbledon before.

Manchester’s Dan Smetihurst, one of four men in the draw making their Wimbledon debut, will play American giant John Isner. James Ward has a tough match against Russian number one Mikhail Youznhy while Dan Evans takes on another Russian, Andrey Kuznetsov.

In the women’s draw the two favourites, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, could face each other in the quarter finals in what is a tough looking top half of the draw. It also includes Eugenie Bouchard taking on Daniela Hantuchova and Heather Watson tackling the talented young Croatian Ajla Tomljanovic.
