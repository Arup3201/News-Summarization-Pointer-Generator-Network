This is the touching moment a kindergarten teacher gave a heartwarming graduation address to his first ever class and stunned them by breaking out into song.

Jeff Berry began his kindergarten teaching career 13 years ago in 2001, just two days before the 9/11 attacks.

His first ever class remained so important to him that he was invited to Lawrence High School, New Jersey to give the graduation address as some of the students from that group were receiving their diplomas.

Mr Berry taught some of the graduates and were in his first ever class at the start of his teaching career in 2001

During his speech he fondly talked about his first days as a teacher standing in front of the young students and how what they learned in kindergarten can also help them in adult life.

But what the audience didn't expect was for Mr Berry to break out into song, singing 'Kindergarten Wall' a strangely fitting song for the occasion by John McCutcheon, which reminds youngsters to 'share everything' and 'play fair'.

Mr Berry starts his speech by recalling how when the children first started at kindergarten 13 years ago, they still tattled on each other, cried and some didn't even listen to direction.

He also reminisced how some of the children would 'openly pick their noses with an amazing sense of purpose' much to the delight of the audience.

During his speech and much to the delight of the audience, Mr Berry broke out into song giving a rendition of the song 'Kindergarten Wall'

But he explained that much of what the graduates would have learned in kindergarten still applies in adult life.

He said: 'These are just simple truths that remind us all how we should conduct ourselves, whether we are 6, 16, or 60.

'Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people. Be aware of wonder. Remember that little seed in the paper cup?

He accompanied his song with the actions as the graduates gathered clapped and cheered their former teacher

'First the roots grow down and then the plant grows up?'

Mr
 Berry then amazes the audience and starts to sing the 'Kindergarten 
Wall' song with the graduates gathered clapping and cheering as he 
breaks into song.

During
 the tune he evens demonstrates the actions, by pointing at the audience
 before inviting them to join in with the last chorus.

He
 then finishes the song with a clap in the air, before saying: 'God 
bless you all and congratulations', while he is applauded and cheered by
 his former students.

When I was a little kid not so long ago, I had to learn a lot of stuff I didn't even know

How to dress myself, tie my shoes, how to jump a rope, how to smile for a picture without looking like a dope

But of all the things I learned my favourite of them all, was a little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall,

Of all you learn here remember this the best, don't hurt each other and clean up your mess,

Take a nap everyday, wash before you eat, hold hands, stick together, look before you cross the street,

And remember the seed in the little paper cup, first the root goes down and then the plant grows up!

Well, it was first, second, third grade, fourth grade, too, where I had to learn the big things the big kids do

To add, subtract, and multiply, read and write and play, how to sit in a little uncomfortable desk for nearly half a day

But of all they taught me my favorite of them all, was the little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall

But lately I've been worried as I look around and see, an awful lot of grown-ups acting foolish as can be

Now I know there's lots of things to know I haven't mastered yet, but it seems there's real important stuff that grown-ups soon forget

So I'm sure we'd all be better off if we would just recall, that little poem hanging on the kindergarten wall
