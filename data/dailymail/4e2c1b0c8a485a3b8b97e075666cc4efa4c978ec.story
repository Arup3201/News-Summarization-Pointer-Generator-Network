Australia has a new marine animal in its waters, one which scientists have been debating the existence of for years.

The Australian Humpback Whale has been determined as its very own species, and this week was given its scientific name - Sousa sahulensis.

One of four humpback dolphins, the Australian variety can be identified by its darker skin and its unique dorsal fin, which sits lower on the body.

It grows to around nine feet long, or 2.7 metres, - a similar size to the Bottlenose Dolphin - and is shyer than its relatives, according to RYOT.

A study by the Wildlife Conservation Society last year concluded that there were four species of humpback dolphins, with one found in Australian waters, two more in the Indonesian-Pacific Ocean and the fourth in the Atalantic region.

However the Australian humpback dolphin was only given its name on Thursday, following the release of a study from the Society for Marine Mammology.

The Marine Mammology study states: 'A review of multiple lines of evidence from skeletal morphology, external morphology, coloration, molecular genetics, and biogeography, in combination provides strong support for the recognition of four species of Sousa.

'Finally, We describe a new species of Sousa, the Australian humpback dolphin, which occurs in the waters of the Sahul Shelf from northern Australia to southern New Guinea.

'It is separated from the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin by a wide distributional gap that coincides with Wallace's Line (a faunal line which separates Australian and Asian organisms)'.

Prior to this study being released, there was debate over whether there was only one, possibly two species of humpback dolphins.

Lead author of the paper Dr Thomas Jefferson of Clymene Enterprises, told IFLScience any confusion over how many varieties of the species there were could now be put to bed.

'We've finally managed to settle many long-standing questions about humpback dolphins - particularly how many species actually exist - using a huge body of data collected over two centuries and analyzed with the latest scientific tools'.

The splitting of the species into four varieties could see each type be classes as endangered, with the population of each humpback dolphin species likely to be low.
