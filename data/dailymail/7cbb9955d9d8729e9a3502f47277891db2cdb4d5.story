One American woman was looking for a quick snack when she ordered a box of chicken nuggets, but she got more bird than she bargained for - she discovered a white feather in the middle of the nugget.

Raquel House from Elkhart, Indiana only discovered the feather when she bite into her second nugget after finishing her order of ice-cream and fries.

'I started to feel like there was hair in my mouth, and that’s when I saw that there was white hair on my tongue, and I looked at my food, and there was feathers coming off the nugget,' Ms House told ABC57.com.

Feather frenzy: Raquel House from Elkhart, Indiana only discovered the feather when she bite into her second nugget after finishing her ice-cream and fries

She called the McDonald’s on Cassopolis Street in Elkhart to let them know her of fowl discovery but she was not satisfied with their response.

Ms House is concerned that the fast food chain is not fully informing its customers of their ingredients.

'It needs to look like meat, and it 
needs to feel like meat. It doesn’t need to be other parts in there and 
if it is, then they need to put that on the box so that we know what 
else we are eating,' said Ms House.

A reporter from ABC7.com met with Ms House to try and ascertain if the foreign object really was a feather.

'It certainly did not look like anything I have ever seen in a nugget before, so we started to dig whatever it was out of the nugget,' said Jason Aubry. 

'We eventually were able to pull it free from the nugget and take a closer look. The outside felt smooth and a little bit like plastic, or finger nail to me.

'It even appeared to have fibers shooting out of one end,' he added.

They took the object to the owner of Prairie 
Winds Nature Farm, who placed the object under a magnifying glass, 
right, and determined it was a pin feather. 

McDonald’s representatives are trying to determine which supplier provided the batch of nuggets in question.

The fast food chain has requested the feather for testing  but claim Ms House has refused to turn it over.

She says she is willing to allow them to examine the feather, but she is hesitant to let it out of her sight.

Ms House has not decided if she will file a lawsuit yet and said to the news website: 'It’s just more important for me that I’m okay and that they, the viewers, know what the conclusion is and that everything else is less important.'

The owner of the McDonald’s that sold House the nuggets, Harry L. Smith, provided ABC7.com with a statement last night:

'We take matters regarding food safety and quality very seriously and caution anyone from jumping to conclusions. Upon learning about this claim, we immediately began the process of collecting the facts. Our customer’s health and safety is paramount.'
