The moment a firefighter saved a tiny kitten from a burnt out house and helped bring it back to life has been captured on his helmet camera.

Cory Kalanick was at a blaze in Fresno, California, when he spotted the lifeless body of the kitten on the floor of the house.

Sadly the kitten did not survive the night, but the touching efforts of Mr Kalanick led to a donation of two animal oxygen masks to help with future rescues.

In the footage of the rescue, the firefighter was seen carrying the limp kitten from the burnt interior of a house and laying it gently on the road, where he fitted a child's oxygen mask over it and gently massaged it back to life.

'I looked down and you can actually see
the cat shining in the spotlight of my flashlight. And I looked back 
and that's when I saw the cat and grabbed him,' he told CBS 47.

Mr Kalanick, who always wears a camera on his uniform, used a tank of oxygen in his attempts to save the animal.

The kitten was laid on a glove to protect it from the hot sidewalk, and water was poured over its body to try to revive it.

Mr Kalanick, who has been a firefighter for ten years, said his crew mates teased him a little at first, but added: 'It's a pretty cool thing that we get to help a kitten out.'

He put an edited version of the rescue on hisÂ YouTube page.

Children who saw the apartment blaze last month said it was the second rescue for the kitten, who had previously been discovered abandoned in a shopping cart.

After being revived, the kitten, which was nicknamed Lucky by the fire department, was taken to Central California SPCA, where it later died.

'It's a very sad loss. The kitten however was in very loving hands to get taken care of,' Beth Caffrey, of SPCA said.

She said that young animals often had trouble recovering from lung damage but told KSEE 24: 'We are very fortunate to have such compassionate people in all the fields that work together.'

After hearing about Mr Kalanick's efforts to save the kitten, a member of the Northern California Havanese Club donated two Fur Life oxygen masks made specifically for animals.

'They're all designed for dogs and their muzzles to go over their face. It fits them properly,' Claudie Parrish said.

'I do think it's wonderful that they would try anything and everything to try and save anything'

The Havanese dog club would like to supply all Fresno fire trucks with the pet masks if it can raise enough donations, she added.
