Dressed smartly for a night out, a group of young women beam for the camera in an upmarket restaurant.

All seems well, but appearances can be deceptive.

When the hen party returned home, bride-to-be Melissa Grogan-Morgan logged on to the eaterie’s Facebook page and left some scathing comments about the service.

However, instead of apologising or offering a constructive response to the bride-to-be's review, the restaurant replied with a vicious tirade which called her group 'the chaviest worst most vile people' and 'absolute trash'

Few, however, would have expected the volley of abuse that was served up by staff in return. Variously, they described the party as ‘cheap chav trash’ and ‘ugly peasants’.

Miss Grogan-Morgan, 27 – at the front of the group picture on the left – had been celebrating her hen night with 17 friends and family at 47 King Street West in Manchester.

But the group said they were disappointed by how disorganised the staff were and left comments about the seating arrangements and the attitude of the manager.

In reply to the remarks the restaurant branded the women the worst diners ever to enter the premises. It said: ‘The chaviest worst most vile people ever to grace our restaurant. Wouldn’t know fine dining if it slapped them in their ugly faces!’ It continued: ‘Best thing ever is that they won’t return! Bottom of the barrel.

Ms Grogan-Morgan, who spent £600 at the venue with the party, wrote negative feedback on the restaurant's Facebook page after being disappointed with the attitude of staff and how they split the party onto two tables

The restaurant also continued its social media rant following a review from Lynsey Herron, who organised the hen do on behalf of the bride-to-be. 47 King Street West called the group 'chav cheap trash' and 'peasants'

47 King Street West (pictured), which opened in Manchester city centre in 2011, describes itself as a provider of 'quality food and first class service' and offers a mix of 'modern upmarket French and British' cuisine

‘And five out of 18 of them turned up 1 hour and 10 minutes after the booking time and expected fresh starters...are you having a laugh... What absolute trash they were. We pity the groom!’

Yesterday the Facebook page of the restaurant, which has welcomed Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal and Coronation Street star Kym Marsh as guests, had been disabled.

Miss Grogan-Morgan, a customer service manager from Stoke-on-Trent, said: ‘For them to post these messages beggars belief…It’s left a bit of a shadow over the whole occasion.’

In the offending review, Miss Grogan-Morgan wrote: ‘The restaurant was nice and the food was fab however the service was awful. 

My friends booked this restaurant for my hen do for 18 of us, originally it was 10 but numbers grew and they let the restaurant know about it with plenty of notice however we were sat on two separate tables that weren’t even next to each other.’ 

Lynsey Herron, who organised the evening out, wrote: ‘We were treated with disdain and aggression the moment we got through the door.’

The restaurant owned by former lawyer Michael Hymanson opened in 2011 and has been a hit with critics. 

Mr Hymanson, 62, whose son Barry is manager, said: ‘The whole incident is regrettable. 

It has been investigated and dealt with internally.’

Howard Hymanson, 62, who is director of 47 King Street West (pictured) and won an MBE last year, told MailOnline today: 'The entire incident is regrettable and it has been both investigated and dealt with internally'

A TripAdvisor review left by a member of the hen party, under the name Laura C, said: 'I don't normally leave a review but I have never experienced management which have been so rude.' She awarded a one star rating

Reviews left on TripAdvisor over the past week, from customers who were not part of the hen party, have been mixed. Some applaud the restaurant's food and service while others lament the staff and 'lengthy waiting time'
