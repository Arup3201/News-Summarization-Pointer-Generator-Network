A lieutenant in the Dallas Police Department has been suspended after bosses found out about her second career as a gangsta rapper.

Dallas Police Lt. Regina Smith, the widow of an officer killed in duty, is on administrative leave over the contents of two videos which show her dressed in provocative clothing and firing her gun.

In one video Smith performs as her hip hop alter ego ‘Lucille Baller.’

Alter ego: Dallas Police Lt. Regina Smith has been suspended from the force after her bosses found out about her hip hop alter ego 'Lucille Baller' who raps about shooting people

Tragic death: Regina pictured with husband Senior Cpl. Norm Smith, the Big Russian, who was fatally shot in 2009

‘Don’t push Ms. Lucy because you won’t like the consequences,’ she raps. ‘Don't you mess with me or I will shoot a [expletive] cuz Lucille Baller, she been to hell and back.’

That video has since been withdrawn from Smith’s website Big Rush In Global Media, a music production company she named after her dead husband.

Senior Cpl. Norm Smith, known as the Big Russian, was fatally shot while trying to serve a robbery warrant in January 2009.

A second video features Smith in a 
‘reality-style’ TV show called ‘Broken Blues,’ in which she says that 
she has been in a ‘state of deep remorse and grief’ since her husband’s 
death.

She also talks about a lack of 
support from the department since her husband’s death and is seen 
shooting her gun, which she calls ‘Ms Lucy.’

‘I got Ms. Lucy right here. Ms. Lucy ain’t loaded,’ says Smith in the video.

Inspiration: Regina Smith named her hip hop persona after comedian Lucille Ball and even samples the 'I Love Lucy' theme tune in her rap song

She also says she wouldn’t be afraid to use the gun on someone who would 'try to take advantage' of her.

‘You see this bullet right here,’ she says. ‘I’ll stick it from they rooter to the tooter and bring it out.’

Smith oversaw burglary and theft detectives at the Southwest and Northwest patrol investigative units, but has been stripped of her police credentials and ordered to stay home during working hours, while the department completes an internal investigation into her conduct, reports CBS11.

A renowned criminologist has criticized Smith, saying he believes she is sending a bad message to the community she polices.

'You could have kids in the community saying, "Hey, this police officer is talking about shooting people, why can't we?"' Dr. Sam Walker, Emeritus Professor of Criminal Justice as the University of Nebraska told News 8.

The inspiration for Regina Smith's hip hop persona is of course Lucille Ball, the American comedian, film, and television star whose career spanned several decades. In fact, Smith's hip hop tune even samples the 'I Love Lucy' theme song.
