A two-year outbreak of salmonella poisoning which has infected more than 130 people, half of them children, is believed to be caused by pet bearded dragons.

At least 132 people in 31 states have fallen ill since February 21, 2012, including 55 who were hospitalized.

Most of the victims were children aged under five whose parents likely bought the Australian native lizards from pet stores, according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.

Authorities have traced the infection back to a range of breeders who may have kept the reptiles in unhygienic conditions before selling them to pet shops.

The
 culprit is salmonella Cotham, a rare strain of bacteria that can cause gastroenteritis and, more seriously, sepsis and meningitis. In some cases, the disease can resist antibiotics.

Jim Nesci, a reptile education expert 
based in Chicago, Illinois, told CBS News the bacteria is caused by the 
environment which pet owners create and is not inherent to the animal.

He said breeders and pet owners should clean the reptile's cage and change the water regularly to avoid disease.

'The biggest problem is the way 
people keep stuff. If they keep it filthy and they handle the
 animal, it's a problem,' Nesci, who has owned reptiles since 1952, said.

'It's called hygiene you can't let your 
animal live in c**p.'

NBC News reported a cluster of cases tied to pet reptiles was first reported in Wisconsin in January.

Since
 2012, 12 people in that state were sickened by the rare strain and 10 
of them reported contact with bearded dragons, an analysis showed.

According to the CDCP report, a laboratory investigation isolated the outbreak strain from samples from a pet bearded dragon and its habitat collected from an ill personâ€™s home in Oregon.

This is not the first time the rare bacterial disease has been linked to bearded dragons.

NBC News reported that in 2011, CDC officials warned about an outbreak when a home cook who kept pet lizards made turkey gravy that sickened 19 people at a Thanksgiving dinner.

Last year, there was a spate of outbreaks that linked transmission of salmonella to pet turtles.

Bearded dragon owners have been advised to keep their pets away from food, drinks and bathrooms, and to disinfect any surfaces the lizards touch.
