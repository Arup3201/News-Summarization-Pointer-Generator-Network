Five healthy lifestyle traits can protect  against bowel cancer, according to new research.

A fifth of cases in men and over a tenth in women could be prevented if they kept slim, banished the stomach bulge and exercised more, a study found.

People should also avoid smoking, drink alcohol moderately and switch to a diet packed with fibres, fruits, vegetables, fish, yoghurt, nuts and seeds with little red and processed meats.

The risk is lowered for each 'good' behaviour trait adopted, and the impact is stronger in men than women.

 The risk is lowered with every 'good' behaviour trait the person adopts, researchers found

People who practised a combination of two, three, four and all five of the healthy behaviours had a 13 per cent, 21 per cent, 34 per cent and 37 per cent lower risk of developing bowel cancer respectively.

Lead author Dr Krasimira Aleksandrova, from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke said: 'Our data confirmed that with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle behaviors the risk that a person will have of developing bowel cancer decreases.

'Estimates based on our study populations suggest that up to 22 per cent of the cases in men and 11 per cent of the cases in women would have been prevented if all five of the healthy lifestyle behaviours had been followed.

'Our results particularly demonstrate the potential for prevention in men who are at a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.

She added: 'These data provide additional incentive to individuals, medical professionals and public health authorities to invest in healthy lifestyle initiatives.

'Each person can contribute a lot to avoid cancer, the more healthy lifestyle changes, the better.'

Around 40,000 new cases are diagnosed every year in the UK and the NHS estimates one in every 20 people will develop bowel cancer during their lifetime.

Every year, around 16,000 people die as a result of bowel cancer.

However, between seven and eight in every 10 people with bowel cancer will live at least one year after diagnosis and more than half of those diagnosed will live at least another 10 years.

Lead author Dr Krasimira Aleksandrova, from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke said: 'Our data confirmed that with an increasing number of healthy lifestyle behaviors the risk that a person will have of developing bowel cancer decreases. File picture 

The study analysed the data of 347,237 men and women from 10 countries from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study using a healthy lifestyle index.

Over the 12-year study period, 3,759 cases of bowel cancer were recorded.

Researchers looked at the five key healthy behaviours associated with a reduction in the risk of developing bowel cancer.

Previous research had identified links between rates of cancer and western lifestyles and focused on isolated lifestyle behaviours with little known about the combined impact of lifestyle choices.

For each of the five behaviors, participants were assigned one point for having the healthy factor and zero for not having the healthy factor.

These points were then summed to generate a cumulative score for each participant.

The more healthy lifestyle factors the cohort adopted, the lower their risk of bowel cancer.

The study was published in the journal BMC Medicine.
