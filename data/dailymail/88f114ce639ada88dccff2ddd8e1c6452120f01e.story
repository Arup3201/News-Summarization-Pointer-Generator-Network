There are certain unmitigated facts – that a gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning, and that as a direct consequence, 27 people in the small town of Newtown, Connecticut are dead.

But as the investigation into the shooting goes on, many aspects of it remain complex.

Perhaps the biggest question lingering on people’s minds across the nation is why the shooting happened – something that may never be answered in a satisfactory manner.

Two days after the shooting that claimed 27 lives, the investigation remains complicated as a nation demands answers

One of the biggest questions remains what connection shooter Adam Lanza had with Sandy Hook Elementary School, and if his mother, Nancy Lanza even taught there. It was initially reported that she was a substitute kindergarten teacher there.

‘No one has heard of her,’ former board member Lillian Bittman told the Wall Street Journal. ‘Teachers don’t know her.’

However, the AP is still reporting that Mrs Lanza was a substitute teacher. It is also unclear what, if any, ties Adam Lanza had with the elementary school

Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver was asked if the victims – including 20 children - suffered. 'If so,' he said, 'not for very long.'

The terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages — the youngest 6 and 7, the oldest 56.

They included Ana Marquez-Greene, a little girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada; Victoria Soto, a 27-year-old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils; and principal Dawn Hochsprung, who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him and paid with her life.

The tragedy has plunged Newtown into mourning and added the picturesque New England community of handsome Colonial homes, red-brick sidewalks and 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change.

Faced with the unimaginable, townspeople sadly took down some of their Christmas decorations and struggled Saturday with how to go on. Signs around town read, 'Hug a teacher today,' ''Please pray for Newtown' and 'Love will get us through.'

As the ‘TODAY’ show notes, information remains confusing and at times, contradictory. It was first reported that the gunman was buzzed in by Principal Hochsprung, but authorities later said that he forced himself in.

Police shed no light on what triggered Adam Lanza, 20, to carry out the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, though state police Lt. Paul Vance said investigators had found "very good evidence ... that our investigators will be able to use in painting the complete picture, the how and, more importantly, the why." He would not elaborate.

However, another law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said investigators have found no note or manifesto from Lanza of the sort they have come to expect after murderous rampages such as the Virginia Tech bloodbath in 2007 that left 33 people dead.

Amid the confusion and sorrow, stories of heroism emerged, including an account of Hochsprung, 47, and the school psychologist, Mary Sherlach, 56, rushing toward Lanza in an attempt to stop him.  Both died.

There was also 27-year-old teacher Victoria Soto, whose name has been invoked as a portrait of selflessness and humanity among unfathomable evil.

Investigators told relatives she was killed while shielding her first-graders from danger. She reportedly hid some students in a bathroom or closet, ensuring they were safe, a cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News.

'She put those children first. That's all she ever talked about,' a friend, Andrea Crowell, told The Associated Press. 'She wanted to do her best for them, to teach them something new every day.'

There was also 6-year-old Emilie Parker, whose grieving father, Robbie, talked to reporters not long after police released the names of the victims but expressed no animosity, offering sympathy for Lanza's family.

'I can't imagine how hard this experience must be for you,' he said.
