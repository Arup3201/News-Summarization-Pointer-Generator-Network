An attempted carjacking in Seattle failed when three carjackers found they were in a vehicle with a manual transmission and none of them knew how to drive a stick shift.

Nancy Fredrickson told KIRO she was getting something out of her trunk Saturday when she turned around to see a gun in her face. Three teens demanded her keys and jumped in her Kia.

'He goes 'I want your keys' and I thought it was a joke!' Ms. Fredrickson exclaimed.

Victim: Nancy Fredrickson, 70, was pulling garage sale items she just bought out of her trunk, when three teenage boys approached her

Serious: Fredrickson quickly realized that it was serious when she saw a gun pointed at her face. She dropped her keys on the ground when one of the young men repeated himself

Fredrickson said she quickly realized the teen pointing the gun at her face meant what he said.

'He says 'I want your keys!' I says 'There right here on the ground.' I had thrown them down like that,' Fredrickson said while pointing to the pavement.

They tried but failed to get it to move and then ran away.

The 70-year-old was in tears when she called 911, but later laughed at the inept carjackers.

Ran off: The three suspects took off on foot through a nearby parking lot, leaving Nancy’s keys in the ignition

 On film: Surveillance cameras caught images of the would-be thieves, but police are still searching for them

Evidence: Though the suspects escaped, police were able to take fingerprints from the car and retrieve DNA and fiber evidence as well

She never imagined a stick shift would prevent a carjacking, but she's happy she and her car were unharmed.

Ms. Fredrickson was grabbing something from the trunk of her car when suddenly she saw a gun inches from her face.

'You turn around and here’s this big gun right here, right here,' she said. 'I’ve got five speed in there and they couldn’t figure out how to get it going.'

Ms Fredrickson said she just stood there as they tried and failed.

'I could hear them trying. They put the keys in, they turned the lock, but they couldn’t figure out how to get it started,' she said.

The teens didn’t find it funny, they panicked.

Stuck: The thieves tried to steal a car in broad daylight on Sunday afternoon, but they were stopped in their tracks by something they didn't anticipate: a manual transmission

Sense of humor: Nancy says can laugh about the carjacking now, because she and her car escaped unharmed

What the suspects didn't realize was  Ms. Fredrickson is a black belt. She's studied martial arts for 25 years and used great discipline by simply standing in place during the attempted robbery, she said.

'You learn that if someone is trying, the best thing you can do is be still. And it's not easy for me to be still at times, but in that situation yes.'

KIRO obtained surveillance video showing the teens sprinting across the parking lot of a nearby parking lot. business park.

The suspects have not been caught, but police were able to  retrieve fingerprints off the gear shift along with some DNA too.

Going nowhere: When the carjackers jumped in the car, ready for their escape, they could not drive the vehice
