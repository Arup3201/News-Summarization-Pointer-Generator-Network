David Cameron held talks with the billionaire head of Google yesterday but failed to tackle him over allegations the giant corporation has dodged hundreds of millions of pounds in tax.

Eric Schmidt attended the meeting in Downing Street as a member of the Prime Minister’s elite Business Advisory Group.

But the Google boss, who has an estimated fortune of £5.5billion, left by a back entrance, apparently in a vain attempt to avoid photographers.

In and out: Google boss Eric Schmidt arrived for a top level meeting with David Cameron through the front door of Number 10, but later left via the back entrance

Mr Cameron had given a presentation 
on his plans to use next month’s G8 Summit in Northern Ireland to agree a
global crackdown on tax havens and corporate tax avoidance.

But sources confirmed that he did not
confront Mr Schmidt directly over reports that Google paid only 
£10million in corporation tax in the UK between 2006 and 2011, despite 
revenues of £11.9billion.

Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord 
Oakeshott said last night that it was extraordinary that the Prime 
Minister had failed to tackle Mr Schmidt over Google’s alleged tax 
avoidance, and called for him to be sacked from his advisory role.

‘How can David Cameron possibly not 
see how outrageous it is to keep Mr Schmidt on his business advisory 
group when Google is making a mint and paying pennies in tax in 
Britain?’ he said.

Last week Google vice president Matt 
Brittin was questioned by MPs over the firm’s policy of processing UK 
deals through the Republic of Ireland, where corporation tax is lower.

Silence: Mr Cameron briefed his Business Advisory Group on his clampdown on tax avoidance but did not challenged Mr Schmidt over revelations about Google's low corporation tax bill

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the 
public accounts committee, accused the company of ‘devious’ behaviour. 
At the weekend, a whistleblower claimed Google had used an ‘immoral’ tax
avoidance scheme to avoid hundreds of millions of pounds in tax.

‘Every time they switch on to Google 
... it reminds them of your rather devious, if I may say so, calculated 
and in my view unethical behaviour in deliberately manipulating the 
reality of your business to avoid paying your fair share of tax to the 
common good? How do you think ordinary people feel?’

Referring
to the ‘Don’t be evil’ slogan, Mrs Hodge added: ‘I think you do do 
evil. That is, you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax.’

Former Google executive Barney Jones 
said he was willing to hand more than 100,000 emails detailing a 
‘concocted scheme’ to avoid tax to HM Revenue and Customs.

Google said Mr Schmidt had attended 
yesterday’s meeting in a ‘personal capacity’, adding: ‘Google pays the 
corporate tax due on its UK activities and complies fully with UK law’.

A source said Mr Schmidt had 
indicated agreement with the Prime Minister’s strategy of trying to 
hammer out a deal to set international rules on tax that would make 
large-scale avoidance much harder.

Yesterday’s meeting came hours after 
CBI president Sir Roger Carr warned Mr Cameron to stop ‘moralising’ to 
business about tax. He accused politicians of using the tax affairs of 
well-known corporations such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon as a 
‘political football’.

Sir Roger, who later attended the 
meeting of the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Group, said tax 
avoidance ‘cannot be about morality - there are no absolutes’.

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron has written to 
the leaders of offshore tax havens stressing the need to get their 
houses in order as he pushes for international action to tackle 
avoidance schemes.

Business Secretary Vince Cable backed 'public outrage' at multi-national firms like Google and Amazon who use legal but 'unethical' means to avoid paying tax.

However, the Prime Minister’s officials spokesman said he would not comment on companies or individuals, despite once branding the comedian Jimmy Carr’s tax avoidance as 'morally wrong'.

Google vice president Matt Brittin floundered during the grilling by MPs, admitting that committee chairman Margaret Hodge knew more about his firm than he did

Ahead of the meeting Downing Street made clear Mr Cameron would not raise Google's tax affairs.

‘The Prime Minister will be taking the group through his G8 agenda. Tax and tax transparency are at the heart of that,’ the spokesman said.

Asked whether the PM will specifically raise the concerns about Google's tax arrangements, the spokesman said: ‘We don't talk about individuals' or individual companies' tax affairs.

‘What the Prime Minister will be doing at that meeting today is explaining the tax transparency part of the G8 agenda which he has been discussing with other G8 leaders and will discuss again at the European Council this week.

‘He certainly is going to raise tax and reform of global tax rules including the ones under which multi-nationals operate. He is going to raise that with the entire Business Advisory Group.

‘When it comes to companies, companies should pay their tax.’

Mr Cameron will set out in detail the work which the UK has been doing in partnership with Germany, France, Spain and Italy on automatic exchanges of tax information.

While refusing to challenge Google, the PM has written to the leaders of Britain's offshore tax havens stressing the need to ‘get our own houses in order’.

Last year Google paid only £7.3million in corporation tax on more than £3billion in UK sales

In a message to 10 crown dependencies and British overseas territories Mr Cameron said he backed their right to be low tax jurisdictions but insisted that rules needed to be set and enforced fairly.

He said he wanted the G8 to ‘knock down the walls of company secrecy’ to reveal who really owns and controls firms.

The Prime Minister's letter calling for more transparency about tax information and the ownership of companies was sent to leaders in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.

Mr Cameron wrote: ‘As you know, I have made fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance a priority for the G8 Summit which the UK is hosting next month.

‘With one month to go, this is the critical moment to get our own houses in order. I am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the UK in taking the lead on two critical issues: tax information exchange and beneficial ownership.’

He told the leaders: ‘I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions. I believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all.

‘But lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world. There is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another.’
