A recovering anorexic has revealed that she almost lost her hands after her immune system  malfunctioned.

Amy Lewis, now 20, from Manchester, said that her hands were left 'witch-like' and withered after she contracted a rare form of auto-immune condition lupus because of her eating disorder.

The condition was first diagnosed a year after she got frostbite during a family Christmas. Although her fingers regained their mobility, she was left in excruciating pain and chillblain lupus was eventually found to be the cause.

Talented: Painter Amy Lewis, 20, almost lost her hands to a combination of anorexia and lupus

Frightening: At her most ill, Amy weighed just 4st 7lb but is now recovered and a healthy weight (right)

Weighing in at just 4st 7lbs, Amy's body was in such poor condition, doctors warned her they might have to amputate her hands if things didn't improve.

'You would think that would have shocked me into doing something about my anorexia, but I didn’t care,' Amy said.

'At 15 you don’t take these things seriously. I knew I was just going to carry on as normal and keep losing weight.'

But fate intervened when she discovered a passion for painting - a discovery that eventually helped her to fight off both lupus and her eating disorder.

Admitted to the Priory 
Clinic in Roehampton, Amy joined other eating disorder sufferers for hypnotherapy classes and now weighs 7st 10lbs - a healthy weight for her 5ft frame.

Damage: Amy's rare form of lupus caused her immune system to attack her hands, leaving them 'witch-like'

Talent: Amy is now studying art and runs a blog where she posts photos of her stunning work

Lupus is an autoimmune condition, caused by problems with the immune system.

The illness causes the immune system to attack healthy tissue, causing symptoms ranging from the mild to the life threatening.

Common symptoms include fatigue, swollen glands, depression and migraines.

Lupus is thought to be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including lifestyle.

Currently studying illustration at the Edinburgh School of Art, Amy says that although she still struggles with the idea of being healthy, she's concentrating on being happy.

'When I was at school at lot of my friends were pretty, plastic 
Barbie girls and I felt like I needed to be like them in order to fit 
in.

'I might not be the prettiest girl in the world, but I am happy being me and that’s what matters.'

She now hopes to forge a career in the art world and runs a blog, on which she posts paintings and portraits of her favourite singer, Jessie J.

'I love Jessie J,' says Amy. 'Her music is all about being yourself and having confidence. I still have bad days but putting one of her CDs on helps me to get through them.

'I tweeted her a picture I drew of her and she replied saying she thought it was amazing.I jumped around my room when I read that she liked it - I was so happy.'
