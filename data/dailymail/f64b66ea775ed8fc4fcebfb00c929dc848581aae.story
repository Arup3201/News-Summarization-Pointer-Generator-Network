With luxurious surroundings and the world famous Waldorf salad created in the building, it is not hard to see why many celebrities, and even presidents, have made The Waldorf Astoria their permanent home.

And now the New York hotel is aiming to attract a few more permanent residents, but turning the area containing the presidential suite and penthouses into exclusive apartments.

Chinese insurance company Anbang reportedly paid $2billion to buy the hotel this month and plans to transform the top floor of the Manhattan hotel into the new apartments.

The Waldorf Astoria in New York has done a deal with Chinese insurance company, Anbang, for $1.95 billion, one of the highest prices per room ever paid for a US hotel, to renovate the top floor for new apartments

The luxury Waldorf Astoria Hotel, in New York, is one of the city's most iconic hotels and a favourite with celebrities

The Towers are already made up of guest apartments but could well be turned into condominiums if new plans go through

According to real estate website The Real Deal reported Wu Xiaohui, chairman of Anbang, recently told Harvard students that 'a potential buyer needs to have more than money to qualify for our apartments.' 

Famous celebrities who have made the hotel their home have included Frank Sinatra who kept a personal suite at the hotel between 1979 and 1988 for when he was out of Los Angeles, for nearly $1 million a year. 

The Towers, within the Waldrof Hotel, has its own separate entrance and already houses apartments for guests, but  it is thought the whole area will be converted into condominiums. 

The hotel is famous for its central location on Park Avenue and the luxurious interiors in its suites, rooms and residences

Former presidents and celebrities including Marilyn Monroe are said to have set up home in the sumptuous hotel 

The residences in The Tower offer a living room and dining area, a kitchenette and a master bedroom with an adjoining boudoir and marble bathroom

It was rumoured Sinatra and his wife etched their initials into the bathroom door but the door was extracted during refurbishment and its whereabouts are unknown. 

Actress Marilyn Monroe was reported to have lived at the Waldorf Astoria for several months, and songwriter Cole Porter and singer wife Linda Lee Thomas kept an apartment there, where Thomas died in 1954. 

Porter's 1934 song You're the Top, contains the lyric, You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad. 

Aside from celebrities, many presidents have made it their dwelling too. 

President Herbert Hoover resided at The Waldorf for more than three decades, and President Dwight Eisenhower stayed from 1967–1969.
