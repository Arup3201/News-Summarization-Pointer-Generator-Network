West Virginia's Attorney General is suing school officials in rural Mingo County over allegations they systematically covered up allegations of sexual abuse committed by two middle school boys against female students.A complaint filed Thursday by Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in Mingo County Circuit Court alleges the victims, female classmates of the boys, were 'subjected to repeated incidents of sexual abuse and/or sexual assault by two fellow male students, and then threatened with discipline and/or retaliated against by members of the Burch Middle School administration when each pursued punishment for the offenders.'

The sexual conduct in question includes 'non-consensual fondling, groping and molestation, often times forcible in nature.'

Mingo County school officials systematically covered up allegations of sexual abuses and assaults at Burch Middle School (pictured) by two boys whose relatives are allegedly board employees, according to an injunction filed on Thursday

According to one of the girls, 'some of the intrusion and groping was above the clothing and some ... was underneath the clothing,' the complaint said, adding that on one time, the girl alleges she was 'forcibly penetrated' by one of the boys on a field trip.The lawsuit seeks an injunction against administrators and employees of Burch Middle School in Delbarton, the Mingo County Board of Education and its superintendent, two juvenile males and the juveniles’ parents, WOWK reported. The station also reported that the parents of the two boys, who are seventh graders, work for the school district.Defendants named in the complaint include Burch Middle School Principal Melissa Webb, Burch Middle School Vice Principal Deanna Maynard, Guidance Counselor Hester Keatley, teacher and athletic coach Melvin Cunningham and Mingo County Schools Superintendent Randy Keatley.'Instead of a meaningful investigation by the school, upon information and belief, the female students have been disparately treated and punished, while the alleged male perpetrators have been "taken care of,"' according to the complaint.

The lawsuit says that after one of the alleged incidents, one boy told the other, 'Don't worry, (your relative) will take care of us.' One boy's relative was involved in investigating and deciding punishment for some of the allegations, according to WOWK.The complaint alleges that at a meeting with one of the female students and her parents, Cunningham made the case that since there were no witnesses, the girl could not prove she had been assaulted and 'threatened disciplinary action …. should she continue to complain without witnesses.' Even more shocking, the father of one of the male students at the meeting told Cunningham, the girl and her parents that his son admitted to the allegations.The West Virginia Human Rights Commission is also investigating the allegations, as is the West Virginia State Police.'The investigation of these crimes are a priority to us and we all need to take it serious and when there's an allegation this has occurred, it's very important this allegation be investigated thoroughly,' Lt. Michael Baylous of the State Police said. 'That's what we're going to do it. we're going to investigate it thoroughly and hopefully get to the bottom. Everyone should be alert and report these crimes as soon as they're made aware of them.'
