A Voice For Men have created a replica of White Ribbon Australia's website where they discrediting research on domestic violence and claim 'women are, as often as men, the initiators of violence'

Texas based group, A Voice For Men, have hijacked Australia's national anti-domestic violence campaign by launching an identical website and preaching an opposing ideology.

Whiteribbon.org has been set up with the same layout and white ribbon icon as the authentic website - whiteribbon.org.au – but slams the original campaign which focuses on women as victims of domestic violence.

Instead, the group claims that 'women are, as often as men, the initiators of violence', adding that they are often 'significantly less remorseful'. Their primary website also advocates for the abolition of the Violence Against Women Act and rape shield laws in the US.

Recent articles published by A Voice For Men's website focus on discrediting research on domestic violence, with one article titled 'Why women's shelters are hotbeds of gender hatred'. 

One of the website's prominent writers, Paul Elam, was responsible for writing an article in October 2013 in which he wrote: 'in the name of equality and fairness, I am proclaiming October to be Bash a Violent B**** Month.'

This is despite research that shows one in three women experience physical or sexual violence by someone they know and that on average, one woman each week is killed as a result of intimate partner violence.

White Ribbon Australia was launched in 2003 as part of a global campaign to raise awareness and end men's violence against women by primarily involving men who encourage women's safety to be priority for other men.

White Ribbon Australia is considering taking legal action against the organisation which is based in Texas. Pictured: Volunteers watch a roll call of all the women killed by domestic violence in the last year from around the world 

Fayssal Sari, White Ribbon Australia's national executive for engagement and partnerships, told Daily Mail Australia that the organisation was seeking legal advice against the 'men's rights' website, which he described as 'an unfortunate nuisance'.

'We have sought legal advice and we have evidence of possible fraud and intellectual property infringements,' Mr Sari said.

'They are clearly trying to ride out our profile to help them achieve their sinister objective to undermine what we do and undermine the good work our 2000 male ambassadors do each day.

'That's the irony of it - we are a male led campaign to highlight the issue of women being overwhelmingly represented in these statistics.'

Mr Sari also addressed concerns that donors or anyone interested in the work of the White Ribbon campaign, may become mislead by the false website and accidentally donate to them.

Their page currently gives website browsers the option to donate and states: 'After receiving many veiled legal threats, we will be routing all donations here to a legal war chest to defend our rights'.

White Ribbon Australia learnt of the possibly fraudulent website a few weeks ago after the group 'coordinated a social media attack' on their Facebook and Twitter pages.

'It was very subtle and not a clearly obvious to many but we managed to defuse it. They were putting in their links on our Facebook that linked to theirs – it was just a very sinister approach, the way they wanted to defer traffic to their website,' Mr Sari said.
