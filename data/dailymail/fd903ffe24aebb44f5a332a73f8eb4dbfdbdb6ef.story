Jailed: Lorry driver Malcolm Simpson was given a six-year sentence following the double death crash

A lorry driver who was responsible for the deaths of two men in a motorway smash described the accident as 'just one of those things'.

Philip Cawley and Thomas Southward were changing a tyre on the hard shoulder of the M6 at Sandbach in Cheshire when trucker Malcolm Simpson careered into them.

The two were described as having 'no escape' when they were hit by the articulated lorry, which had first strayed into the third 'fast' 
lane - prohibited for heavy goods vehicles - and twice drifted on to the
hard shoulder before ploughing into the defenceless men.

Simpson, of Selby in north Yorkshire,
was jailed for six years after a judge said he placed the security of 
his load before public safety.

The trucker, a lorry driver for nearly 30 years, showed no emotion as he was jailed at Chester Crown Court.

The court heard how, in evidence, the defendant said he felt sorry for the losses to the victimâ€™s families but described the accident as 'one of those things'.

However, defending barrister 
Simon LeBrocq said that Simpson had not intended for the the comment to sound callous and that he very much regretted what happened.

Mr Cawley. 39, of Ashton in Makerfield, and Mr Southward, 69, of Haydock, St Helens, were were killed instantly in the horrifying accident on September 10, 2010.

The two men were both experienced lorry drivers and had been working for Mr Cawley's vehicle services company when a car they were towing suffered a puncture.

They were described as 'sitting ducks' as they changed the tyre on the hard shoulder shortly before Simpson's lorry crashed into them.

The collision was captured by a Highways Agency motorway camera, as well as the on-board camera of a VOSA vehicle which happened to be passing at the time.

Another lorry driver told the how the accident was like
a scene from the film Final Destination, where he could see what was 
going to happen but was powerless to stop it.

Simpson, who has not driven since the accident and has been working in a care home, had denied falling asleep at the wheel and claimed he had simply not seen the two men.

He told the court he could not remember what had happened and his defence team suggested he had suffered some kind of medical episode.

After his unanimous conviction by the 
jury, the Recorder of Chester, Judge Elgan Edwards said he could give no credit in sentence for a 
guilty plea, for he had denied all the allegations against him and had 
to be convicted by the jury.

Records showed that in the previous 
few days Simpson had taken a somewhat cavalier attitude to the 
requirements to take proper rest breaks.

That day he had been involved in at least one, if not two, earlier incidents of drifting on the motorway.

Judge Edwards said: 'You should have 
been warned and taken appropriate action instead of which you continued 
driving and and ultimately you then drifted onto the hard shoulder and 
killed two perfectly innocent men going about their job in a proper 
manner.'

Victims 'stood no chance whatsoever'

The judge said the victims were extremely vulnerable, and they 'stood no chance whatsoever'.

The defendant had said that his 
employers did not like a valuable load to be parked up in a lay-by and 
the judge said that he was quite satisfied he had put his job before 
safety matters.

It was that sort of thing which the legislation was intended to abate.

He added: 'The public are entitled to
expect professional drivers of HGVs, which can cause enormous damage, 
to behave responsibly.

'Professional drivers must behave responsible and behave reasonably and ensure that proper rest periods were taken.'

Judge Edwards also commended the actions of another driver at the scene, who tried his best to cover up the bodies and preserve their dignity, waving traffic away from the collision.

The judge praised Nicholas Medway for his public spirited actions and said that he had gone further than one would normally expect someone to do in such circumstances.

Judge Edwards said the two concurrent six-year sentences were the most lenient he could pass, consistent with his public duty.
