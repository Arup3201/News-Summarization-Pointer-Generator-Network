The 75-year-old mother of baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken narrowly escaped an armed carjacking attempt in a bank parking lot in Maryland a year after she was kidnapped at gunpoint. 

A suspect with a handgun approached Violet Ripken outside of NBRS Bank in Aberdeen Tuesday and demanded her car, but she scared him off by activating a key alarm, police said.

Aberdeen police spokesman Lt. Frederick Budnick said Miss Ripken was not hurt in the incident, and the suspected carjacker has since been arrested.

In custody: Jesse Bowen was arrested two hours after police say he attempted to carjack Vi Ripken

Ripken was in the parking lot of NBRS 
Bank at 201 West Bel Air Avenue in Aberdeen at around 3pm when she was 
approached by a man with a gun who demanded her Honda sedan.

Budnick
said the quick-thinking woman pushed the panic button, activating the 
car alarm and prompting the suspect to flee. Police said the woman then 
went into the bank to report the crime.

Police identified the suspect, 33-year-old Jesse Bowen, after viewing an ATM photo and apprehended him about two hours later. Officers reportedly had a run-in with the man a week earlier.

Bowen has been charged with with attempted armed robbery, attempted armed carjacking, possessing a dangerous weapon, first-degree assault and several controlled substance charges.

This is the second time in 15 months that Miss Ripken has been targeted by an armed suspect. 

Abduction: Last July, police say this man kidnapped Miss Ripken from her home at gunpoint, but returned her unharmed 24 hours later

On July 24, 2012, Ripken was abducted from the garage of her Aberdeen home at gunpoint and returned unharmed 24 hours later after being driven around in the back of her car blindfolded and with her hands bound. 

At that time, police released a sketch, photographs and a surveillance video that were believed to show a potential suspect but no arrests have been made.

In August of this year, Cal Ripken announced a $100,000 reward for information that helps lead to the capture and conviction of the person responsible for his mother’s abduction.

He also appealed to America's Most Wanted for help in searching for the suspect.

Miss Ripken later told The Baltimore Sun that her kidnapping left her worried but that she was determined not to let it ruin her life.

Budnick said Tuesday night that there is no evidence to suggest that the two crimes are interconnected.

Cal Ripken Jr, 53, played in record 
2,632 consecutive games in a 21-year career with the Baltimore Orioles. 
He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.

Since retiring from baseball, Ripken has been working as a sportscaster for TBS. His brother, Bill, is an analyst for MLB network.

The station WBAL reported that Carl Ripken is currently in Los Angeles, where he is covering the National League Championship Series.
