A pensioner has been banned from driving for 12 months after he was caught reading a map at the wheel.

Peter Rigby was caught on camera driving erratically along the A59 at Beamsley Hill for more than 10 seconds as he worked out directions.

Rigby's Honda Jazz caught the attention of traffic police after it veered into the overtaking lane. Officers caught clear footage of him holding the map right in front of his face.

Hmm, which way now? Peter Rigby seen in a police video reading a map while driving along the A59

Better have a quick peek of the road: Rigby peers over the top of his map to make sure he's not about to crash

Police said Rigby completely obscured 
his view of the road and put himself and other road users in serious 
jeopardy through his reckless behaviour.

The
 73-year-old, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dangerous
 driving at Skipton Magistrates Court over March 4 incident.

As well as the year-long ban, he was fined £1,080 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £108 and costs of £85.

He must also take an extended driving test before he is allowed his licence back.

This isn't right! Rigby turns the pages of his road map as he tries to work out which way to go next

Maybe if you turn it upside down... Rigby continues to stare at the map, oblivious to the police filming him

Dave Brown, Safety Camera Team Manager for North Yorkshire police, said Rigby should consider himself lucky.

'Mr Rigby captured the attention of the safety camera operator when he began to wander across the dotted white line of the overtaking lane as he read the map,' said Mr Brown.

'The footage captured by the safety camera shows the driver is distracted for a least 10 seconds while flicking through his atlas and then holding it up to his face, completely obscuring his view of the road.

'Those 10 seconds could have been disastrous for him or other road users - he should consider himself fortunate that he was in a position to attend court and escape with just a driving ban and hefty fine.

'This case demonstrates the clear evidence captured by the safety camera and should serve as a reminder to other road users of the potential consequences if they choose to take dangerous and unnecessary risks.'
