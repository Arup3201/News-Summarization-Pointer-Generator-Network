The health and safety warning was sent out ahead of filming for an episode in which the ashes of Derek Branning (pictured) were scattered

TV sets can often be dangerous places, but it appears as though the BBC might have taken things a step too far.

The corporation recently filed a nine-page report outlining the health and safety risks of working in Cassiobury Park, Watford, with a dog that was hired for the day.

In a risk assessment carried out for an episode in which the ashes of Derek Branning were scattered, actors were even warned about the dangers of the potentially harmful results of working with sheep.

The document circulated among the cast and crew before the shoot told of the dangers of 'slippery' surfaces and cold weather.

It also gave advice such as wearing 'appropriate clothing' and told workers to take 'warm drinks' for the scene which was filmed on Valentine's Day.

A source on the set told The Sun: 'The BBC doesn't help itself sometimes with such nonsense. The cast and crew were in hysterics.

'It's a waste of time and shows the fear factor that's spread through the corporation.'

Among those to receive the memo were characters Kat and Carol, played by Jessie Wallace and Lindsey Coulson respectively, and saw them scattering Derek's ashes.

Because a dog called Duffie was hired for the day there was a warning about how to handle him, but it went well beyond the treatment of the dog.

Danger zone? The filming took place at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire

The report said: 'Animals can cause injury, by bites, scratches, stings, kicking or crushing; infection or infestation from micro-organisms or parasites.'

It also warned that there was a risk of miscarriage in pregnant workers because of harmful organisms on animals, 'especially sheep'.

A BBC spokesman said: 'There is a legal requirement to undertake a risk assessment and this covered a wider range of activities than just working in the park.'

They added that risk assessments cover blocks of filming and not just one episode.
