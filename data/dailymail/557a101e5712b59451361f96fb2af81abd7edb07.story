Emile Heskey has revealed he is looking for a new club in England after two years playing in Australia.

The striker signed for A-League side Newcastle Jets in 2012 but has now decided to leave.

'I have left the Jets. I had two great years there, a wonderful country. I am back in England and I am looking for a new club,' revealed the 36 year old during a live Sony chat with fans.

Heskey also believes Cristiano Ronaldo is a better player than Lionel Messi and that Thomas Muller has been the best player at the World Cup.

He said: 'Messi is a better dribbler, but Ronaldo gives you so much more. He tackles, wins headers, as well as his attacking contributions. He does everything.

'The best attacker has been Thomas Muller. His workrate, finishing ability, versatility. If I had to pick a best front-three from the World Cup it would be James Rodriguez, Muller and Arjen Robben.'
