Clarke Carlisle previously threw himself in front of a lorry in a bid to take his own life, leaving him injured and the driver unable to get behind the wheel again 

The lorry driver who struck former footballer Clarke Carlisle, who had thrown himself into the vehicle's path, has said he may never be able to drive an HGV again. 

Earlier this year the 35-year-old Premier League defender revealed how he had jumped in front of a lorry near his home on the A64, near York after battling severe depression. 

He was struck by Darren Pease who feared both would die after glass shattered following the crash, leaving them with cuts to their faces and the driver temporarily blinded. 

 

Mr Pease, 53, told the Daily Mirror: 'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point. I can't drive a car properly, never mind a wagon.'

The lorry driver, who had been travelling to Driffield in east Yorkshire at the time of the crash, said he spent Christmas wondering if Carlisle, who has three children, was going to survive. Mr Pease said he now struggles to leave the house and has not been able to return to work. 

He added: 'All I could think was that I had killed someone. How am I going to live with this? What am I going to tell everybody? 

'What do you say? It's unreal, the shock meant I couldn't stand or walk, I was in a wheelchair.'

Mr Pease also struggles if images of Carlisle appear on the television and has to quickly switch it off. 

Carlisle was released from hospital last month, around six weeks after the accident on December 22.

He said after he was released he realised he was unwell. He had been struggling after he was told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role.

Carlisle admitted he went straight to a casino and blew money he and his wife had saved, only hours later on December 20, to be charged with drink-driving.

It was then that the former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association decided that his children could not have a criminal father and he decided he wanted to die. 

Carlisle was recently released from hospital six weeks after he was injured in a collision with a lorry

After the accident Carlisle said he had 'overwhelming feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment.' 

He was taken to hospital and suffered cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. He is now having counselling. 

Mr Pease has had to take sick leave from his £19,500-a-year job and is receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. 

Carlisle was the first player to win Countdown and in 2002 was awarded the title 'Britain's Brainiest Footballer'

In 2011 he became the first footballer to appear on BBC's topical debate show Question Time (far left) 

After Carlisle spoke out about the incident sports personalities and football clubs posted messages of support. 

Carlisle, considered one of the most intelligent footballers of his generation with 10 Grade A GCSEs, made more than 500 appearances for nine clubs in a career that spanned 16 years. He was the first football player to win Countdown in 2002 and BBC Sport awarded him the title 'Britain's brainiest footballer.' 

He has also appeared on Question Time twice.

His most notable stint as a Premier League player came during his five years with Burnley, with him featuring for them in 2009-10, their first season in the division.

After Carlisle spoke out about the crash actor Ralf Little faced criticism after he accused the footballer of not telling the full story.
