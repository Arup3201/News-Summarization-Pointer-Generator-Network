British families are the biggest web shoppers in the world with almost £1 in every £5 spent through computers, tablets and smartphones.

Some 18.3 per cent of all retail spending – which does not include food food – is made via the internet, according to new figures from the British Retail Consortium.

This is the highest figure on record and believed to be considerably higher than the rest of Europe and even the USA.

A separate study suggests Britons will spend £20.4billion on the web in the nine weeks before Christmas with £10billion in December alone.

The switch to shopping online is having a profound effect on high streets with the result that tens of thousands of bricks and mortar stores have no future.

Many famous names, from Comet to Clintons cards, have disappeared while other major chains have called a halt to the building of large new stores.

The shift has triggered a major rethink about the future of town centres, with government planning ministers signalling that derelict shopping streets must be turned over to housing.

The BRC said total retail sales in 
October were up by 2.6 per cent on the same month last year, however 
there were falls on both food and clothing.

It
picked out the internet as being the star performer, saying: ‘Online 
sales of non-food products in the UK grew 12.1 per cent in October 
versus a year earlier.

‘The online penetration rate was 18.3 per cent in October, the highest level ever recorded by our monitor over 23 months.’

The IMRG, which is the trade body for web stores, predicts Christmas web sales will be up by 15 per cent on a year ago, boosted by the use of smartphones and tablets.

Spokesman Tina Spooner said: ‘Already we are seeing a number of retailers ramping up their online offering in the run up to Christmas.

‘Click & Collect, next day delivery and even one-hour delivery slots are just a few of the options on offer to attract the lucrative festive shopper at this highly competitive time of year.’

Big sellers in October included stand-alone mixers, which were made popular by the BBC’s Great British Bake Off series, tablets such as the new iPad Air, televisions, fridges and washing machines.

Computer games also sold well following the launch of the British success story, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Fifa 14.

A number of celebrity books, including Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography, had strong sales, giving a boost to a market that had been in the doldrums.

High street sales of fashion and shoes suffered in October because the warmer than usual weather hit demand for the autumn ranges, however this was partially off-set by increased online sales.

Dresses, shoes and engagement rings are among the most searched for items among consumers on the web, alongside computer games, the iPad and the xBox games console.

A recent EU study found 82 per cent of Britons regularly shop online, which is the highest of the 28 member states.

Denmark and Sweden came in second at 79 per cent, ahead of Germany on 77 per cent, Luxembourg on 73 per cent and Finland at 72 per cent.

At the other end of the scale were Italy and Estonia, at just 29 per cent, and Romania at just 11 per cent.

The research found internet users in the UK lead for online purchases of clothes and food, while Sweden is number one on travel and Luxembourg for books.

Internet shopping is also stronger in the UK than the USA because web purchases of food and groceries has not taken off on the other side of the Atlantic to the same extent.

Some 21 per cent of families here shop online for food and groceries, compared to less than 10per cent in Europe and the rest of the world.

Head of Retail at KPMG, David McCorquodale, predicted retailers will have to battle hard to win sales ahead of Christmas amid a continuing cost of living squeeze.

‘Shoppers seem reluctant to buy their gifts early and at full price and many may be delaying their purchases in the hope that retailers will discount festive goods as the big day nears,’ he said.

‘The pressure is on retailers to kick start sales, without the need to heavily discount.  Christmas has always been retailers’ golden goose and a good performance in the next two months will help those in the red move back to the black.’
