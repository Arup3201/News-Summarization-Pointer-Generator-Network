High-speed smash: Baroness Billingham survived the crash when her car was hit by a people carrier which had allegedly jumped the lights

A Labour Shadow Minister has told how she was nearly killed in a high-speed car crash which threw her vehicle across three lanes of traffic after being hit by a driver linked to the Qatari embassy.

Baroness Billingham’s Toyota Prius was shunted 30ft across a busy Central London street after the collision with a people-carrier which had apparently failed to stop at a red light.

The peer had to be cut free from the wreckage by rescue workers. Doctors were stunned to discover that the 73-year-old did not sustain life-threatening injuries.

Lady Billingham said: ‘I am making a recovery – it was a hell of a shock. I should be dead, make no bones about it.’

Labour’s spokesman on culture, media and sport, Lady Billingham sustained injuries to her thorax, and still has difficulties breathing five months after the accident.

She is unable to take part in strenuous activities such as tennis, and is undergoing physiotherapy.

She plans to use the three-month Parliamentary recess to recover fully. ‘I am determined to get back in shape. I could have been paralysed or even killed,’ she said.

Lady Billingham was driving back to her home in Hampstead, North London, after a House of Lords debate when the crash happened in Gloucester Place,  near Marble Arch.

It is believed that the driver of the people-carrier failed to stop at a side road called George Street, and hit the peer’s Prius so hard that it was flung across the lanes, ending up on the opposite pavement.

‘It was all very frightening,’ she said. ‘The driver hit me at a right angle on my side of the car. Thank goodness there was nothing along those three lanes at the time and that nobody was pushing a pram along the pavement.’

The peer, who also suffered psychological trauma, took two months off work. She said her insurers told her the driver, Jemal Mohammed Amin, 40, worked for the Qatar embassy’s transport staff.

However, an embassy spokesman said: ‘The driver is not an embassy driver. He works for a car hire company so it’s nothing to do with us.’

But when The Mail on Sunday made inquiries at his luxury flat in Chelsea, Amin’s wife, Khedra, said her husband was a driver for the Qatari embassy.

Amin has been charged with driving without due care and attention, and is due to appear before City of London Magistrates’ Court next Friday.

Lady Billingham declined to comment on whether she is suing the driver over the accident.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
