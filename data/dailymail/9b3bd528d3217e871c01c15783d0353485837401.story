After finding itself marooned on the balcony of a third floor flat when it crash landed mid-flight, there was nothing for this swan to do but sit tight and wait to be rescued.

The RSPCA came to the aid of the trapped bird after Jacky Weaver, 50, spotted the swan sitting on her neighbour's balcony at their building in Poole, Dorset.

The nurse said she had initially mistaken it for a tasteless garden ornament until the 'stressed' swan began flapping its wings and she realised it was real.

Stranded: The swan had to be rescued from the third floor balcony at a block of flats in Poole, Dorset

RSPCA inspector Graham Hammond arrived at the block of flats to rescue the bird, but the swan still had a wait in store, as Mr Hammond couldn't get to it until the owner of the flat got home an hour later to let him in.

The creature was said to be a little 'stressed', but otherwise unharmed.

Ms Weaver said: 'I thought someone had a new ornament on their balcony and thought it was a bit naff, but then it suddenly moved.

'I couldn't fathom how on earth it ended up there and was quite surprised.

'They need quite a lot of room to land and take off, yet there was a swan on the balcony of the third floor.'

Stuck: The swan was eventually released back into the wild after it was rescued from its perch three storeys up

'I called the RSPCA at about 2pm and at about 5pm the owners came home,' said Ms Weaver.

The RSPCA inspector walked straight up to the swan, picked it up and carried it out.

Mr Hammond said: 'I think the swan must have crash landed.

'They
are quite good at hitting power lines. Although they are very elegant 
and serene on the water they are not so graceful in the air.

'It was very healthy. I put it in the van and it looked fine so I took it to an open space nearby and released it there.'David
Wheeler, a swanherd at the nearby Abbotsbury Swannery, said: 'Swans 
sometimes aren't the best in flight, especially the younger ones and 
they can frequently bang into things.

'They are not trying to nest quite yet and this swan was probably looking for some food.

'It is very unusual to see one on a small balcony,' he added.
