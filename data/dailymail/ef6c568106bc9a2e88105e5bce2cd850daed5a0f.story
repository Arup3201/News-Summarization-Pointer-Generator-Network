California producer Truett-Hurst has launched the worldâ€™s first range of wines in square bottles.

The range, called California Square, comes in three varieties: Russian River Valley Chardonnay, Paso Robles Cabernet and a red blend.

Design firm Stranger and Stranger created the ornate bottles with embossing and vintage graphics.

Hip to be square: The new square bottles are world's apart from traditional rounded wine bottles

The unique square bottles are modeled on classic spirit bottles.

The Dry Creek Valley wine producer felt a change was in order for the 'old, stodgy, "square" looking wine bottles' wine drinkers are accustomed to.

Big deal: Actor Chris Noth reportedly enjoyed California Square wine at a pre-Emmys party last month

Why use the default option just because its been the standard for hundreds of years, went the thought behind the bottle.

'Square bottles take up less space but you never see them on the wine shelves. If the wine industry turned over to square instead of round bottles we'd save almost a million trees in outer cardboard boxes alone,' a press release for the product claims.

In addition, says the company, the bottles won't roll away if placed on their sides, they can be repurposed as olive oil dispensers or vases, and they are easy to store - you 'don't need a wine rack, just some book-ends.'

'Introducing an alternative package is tricky,' Truett-Hurt winemaker Virginia Marie Lambrix says.

'The wine inside has to over-deliver and create a memorable impression for the consumer.'

So, does the wine inside match up to the packaging?

'The three wines were a huge smash when Truett-Hurst and Total Wine & More featured them in a sneak preview prior to the 65th annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles in late September,' according to Truett-Hurst.

The Truett-Hurst winery creates its California Square wines using biodynamic farming principles in Sonoma County, California.

The wines retail for $20, and are available at Total Wine & More.
