A Washington Post photograph has been disqualified after winning a prestigious photography prize after it emerged it broke the rules by being heavily photo-shopped.

The image, taken by the newspaper's staff photographer Tracy Woodward, won the sports feature section of the White House News Photographers Association (WHNPA) ‘Eyes of History’ contest for its depiction of a high school wrestling champion in Virginia at the moment he won.

However, the newspaper discovered the dramatic image had been edited from its original format prompting the picture editor to alert the authorities and have it withdrawn - after it had been handed a top prize.

Unedited: This is the version of the photograph entitled State Champion which appeared in print. It shows the referee and the audience watching behind

Where's the ref: In the version submitted for the prize the referee is much less noticeable. Photo-shopping in such a way is against the rules of the prestigious prize

The newspaper founded in 1877 said it has strict editorial guidelines on the use of photo-shop, and although the picture appeared in its unedited form in the paper, they said their rules extend to competition entries made by members of staff.

Photo-shopping in such a way was also barred in the competition entry rules.

Photography Director MaryAnne Golon told the magazine News Photographer: 'A Washington Post photographer entered an altered photograph to the 
WHNPA contest.

'Once Post editors saw that it had been altered from what 
had originally been published in The Post, we withdrew the photo from 
consideration. The Post's ethics policy prohibits the manipulation of 
photographs, and we have taken action in accordance with that policy."

Woodward, who has worked at the paper for 16 years, is believed to have submitted 'State Champion' into the contest of his own accord.

The two pictures, when presented side-by-side, clearly show the changes that have taken place.

Embarrassing admission: Editors at the Post informed the competition authorities that their staff photographer had made photo-shop changes to his winning entry that breached the rules

The print version of the picture features a referee in the background of the dramatic shot while the competition entry has the figure of the referee blacked-out making him hard to notice and the wrestler more noticeable in the foreground.

WHNPA president Ron Sachs's issued a statement on Monday saying the photograph was 'digitally manipulated in violation of the contest rules'.

'When we became aware of the altered image, the photo was immediately 
disqualified in accordance with our published contest rules,' he said.

'The rules state: The content of a photograph must not be altered in 
Photoshop or by any other means. No element should be digitally added to
 or subtracted from any photograph and the image must be a truthful 
representation of whatever happened in front of the camera during 
exposure. Retouching to eliminate dust and scratches is acceptable.'

'Reasonable adjustments in Photoshop are acceptable. These include 
cropping, dodging and burning, conversion into grayscale, and normal 
toning and color adjustments that restore the authentic nature of the 
photograph.

'Excessive changes in density, contrast, color and 
saturation levels that alter the original scene are not acceptable. 
Backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning 
down or by aggressive toning. Frames or borders outside the image area 
are not allowed nor is text—digital or otherwise—allowed on the image.'

The newspaper did not comment on Woodward's ongoing status at the newspaper, telling the magazine they were  'taking action that is consistent with [their] photo manipulation policy,' and that 'it’s an internal personnel matter at this time.'
