Michael Winner's widow has revealed that she has been left penniless after his assets were frozen immediately after his death.

Geraldine Winner has not been able to draw money from the film-director's accounts since his death two months ago as they were all in his name.

She told the Sunday Times: 'You know, the bank accounts were frozen. They froze them. Literally within five minutes of his death they had frozen everything.

Michael Winner's assets were frozen within five minutes of his death in January according to his widow Geraldine

'He would never, ever, ever, have wanted me to find myself in this situation... He would never, ever have left me with no money. never.'

The sale of Mr Winner's £60million Kensington mansion has been put on hold.

Former girlfriends of Mr Winner, who died aged 77 in January, have also complained that they are struggling.

Geraldine added that one of Mr Winner's exes had text her.

She said she had been promised her allowance would continue so that she could pay her mortgage until the probate ended, but it had been stopped.

Mrs Winner married the director 18 months ago after a decades long friendship.

She is now planning a memorial service for him in July and has become a trustee of a charity that her husband set up - the Police Memorial Trust.

The trust was set up when Mr Winner became appalled at the death of PC Yvonne Fletcher in 1984.

The lawyers handling Mr Winner's estate, PWT Advice, say that it is normal for assets to be frozen after someone dies and that they are working as hard as they can to resolve the estate.
