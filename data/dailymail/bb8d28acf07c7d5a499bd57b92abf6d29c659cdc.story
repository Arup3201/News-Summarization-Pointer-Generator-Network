He had previously been a free agent following his departure from Blackpool, for whom he was an ever-present in the Sky Bet Championship last term.

Gilks had been with the Tangerines since 2008, helping them gain promotion to the Premier League in 2010 and featuring during their one-season stay in the division.

He began his career with his home-town club Rochdale and has also spent time with Norwich and, on loan from Blackpool, at Shrewsbury.

Gilks will link up with his new team-mates on Burnley's return to pre-season training later this week.

He is the second player the Turf Moor outfit have signed since they secured their return to the Premier League at the end of 2013/14, with winger Michael Kightly, captured on a permanent deal from Stoke after a loan stint, having been the first.
