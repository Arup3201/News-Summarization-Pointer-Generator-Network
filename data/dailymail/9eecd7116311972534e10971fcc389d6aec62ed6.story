Bill de Blasio and his family moved into the historic Gracie Mansion this week, and they enlisted the help of West Elm to redecorate it with donated furniture.

In one photo from inside the official mayoral residence that New York's First Family now call home, a room is adorned with patterned beanbags, bright blue sofas and geometric light fixtures from the Brooklyn-based home furnishing company.

The Mayor's wife Chirlane McCray says that the update, which was valued at about $65,000, successfully stayed true to the home's historic roots while making it more comfortable for a modern family.

'Gracie Mansion will always be the People's House, but Bill, Chiara, Dante, and I are excited to call it home,' she said of the sprawling residence, which dates back to 1799.

'With assistance from West Elm, we are honoring and preserving one of the nation's great historic residences, while turning Gracie into a modern living space that fits our family. We've moved to a new borough, but we brought some Brooklyn flavor with us.'

The furnishing company - which is actually owned by San Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma - decked out the house's bedrooms, a family room and a formal sitting room, as well as the Mayor and his wife's study.

The updated formal sitting room is decorated with a West Elm sofa and coffee table. While the flower vases and pillows are distinctly modern, the chandelier and floral wallpaper are original.

The family officially moved into the residence on Sunday night after returning from their vacation to Italy.

'It's an extraordinary place, and coming home to it for the first time was a pretty amazing feeling,' Mayor de Blasio told the New York Daily News.

'Everyone knows my love for my neighborhood in Brooklyn and my home in Brooklyn,' he said of the Park Slope townhouse they lived in for 14 years. 'So it was a little strange to come home to Gracie Mansion.'

West Elm Home Stylist Johanna Mele teamed up with Ms McCray to redecorate the mansion.

'She 
wanted rooms that reflected her children's specific and individual 
styles, and a home that reflected their personal style as a family - 
approachable, livable, with a base of calming neutrals and accents of 
rich colors, natural and global influences,' reads the West Elm website.

The pair posed for a picture on the steps of the iconic household, grinning in front of its yellow front door.

While the private rooms were given an update to reflect the First Family's needs, the public spaces in the Gracie Mansion remained untouched.

'Gracie Mansion is an amazing home and
 the First Family will be able to bring their style to the space,' Ms 
Mele said in a statement.

'There is so much history here that has inspired the design direction we took. We're honored and excited to be working on the project.'

Only visiting public officials and the Mayor's family are allowed to reside in the taxpayer-funded home.
