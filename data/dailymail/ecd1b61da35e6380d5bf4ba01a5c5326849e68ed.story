The former senior detective who brought two of Stephen Lawrence’s murderers to justice claims Scotland Yard chiefs have lost interest in the case.

Clive Driscoll, who retired from the Metropolitan Police a few weeks ago, also alleges his successful investigation into killers Gary Dobson and David Norris was hampered by ‘disruption tactics’ from within the force.

He added senior officers in the Met had discussions about holding back certain documents from the Ellison Review, the independent inquiry that looked into allegations of police corruption in the Lawrence case.

Clive Driscoll brought two of Stephen Lawrence¿s murderers to justice. He claims Scotland Yard chiefs have lost interest in the case

He warned: 'One bad decision around disclosure undoes the remarkable work that police officers do up and down the country.

'For me, just be open and honest, warts and all.'

Supporters of Mr Driscoll, who reached the rank of detective chief inspector and enjoyed the trust of Stephen’s parents Neville and Doreen, claim he was cruelly forced out of the Met as part of its drive to cut costs.

They also say his departure reflects the force’s dwindling interest in Stephen’ s case, which has cost the force tens of millions of pounds in terms of different investigations, public inquiries and compensation to the black teenager’s family.

Loss: Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he was stabbed to death near a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993, in a racist attack by a gang of white youths

Stephen’s close friend Duwayne Brooks, who witnessed his murder, says he has lost confidence in the Met as a result of Mr Driscolls’s enforced departure in May.

But Yard sources insist the force remains committed to bringing other members of the gang who murdered Stephen to justice, and point out that with more than 30 years’ of police service, Mr Driscoll was eligible to retire on a full pension.

Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he was stabbed to death near a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993, in a racist attack by a gang of white youths.

After years of bungling and failed inquiries, Mr Driscoll eventually led an investigation that brought the case to court successfully.

Dobson and Norris – two of the original five prime suspects named as Stephen’s killers by the Daily Mail in 1997 - were convicted of murder in January 2012, following a forensic breakthrough in the case.

But Mr Driscoll said there had been officers inside the Met who did not want a 'successful prosecution'.

He told BBC2’s Newsnight programme: 'There were certainly people I think in senior levels in the Met that weren’t enthusiastic about the investigation. I certainly felt that.”

He felt so concerned about what he described as “disruption tactics” that he said he emailed some senior officers with his fears. In his interview with Newsnight, he did not elaborate on his concerns.

He said relationships between the Lawrence family and the Met were as bad as they had been just after Stephen’s murder and said the Met must now be as transparent as possible to rebuild the trust of the public.

He said: 'I believe we are in a position today where we have an opportunity to learn and we have an opportunity to put right some of the wrongs.”

Responding to the retired detective’s claims, Duwayne Brooks told Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday (wed) that he had yet to speak to anyone from the new team of Met officers now investigating Stephen’s murder.

‘I would like to see more convictions. I would like to see everyone involved convicted,’ he said.

He said he didn’t know whether he would be able to trust the police, in aftermath of Mr Driscoll’s departure.

‘The way Clive has been treated is not how I would expect the Metropolitan Police to treat somebody who has just got a conviction…a conviction nobody thought was possible,’ he said.

Jocelyn Cockburn, Neville Lawrence’s solicitor, told Today: ‘Like Duwayne Brooks has said, it is unfortunate that after a successful conviction, the murder (inquiry) team that had Mr Lawrence’s full confidence has been changed.

'There is a feeling that the murder investigation is being closed down. Mr Lawrence will need some persuasion that is being vigorously pursued.’

She said Mr Lawrence is seeking a further inquiry into claims of a ‘lack of transparency and cooperation’ in the Met with the 1998 Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen’s murder, which considered whether corruption had blighted the initial inquiry into his death.

‘If Mr Driscoll is saying there were attempts to derail the (most recent) murder investigation, then I would consider that to be new,’ she added.

The Met said no relevant Stephen Lawrence material had been intentionally withheld from the Ellison Review of the Lawrence case and its policy was to be open and transparent.

It added it was still committed to continuing the Lawrence investigation.
