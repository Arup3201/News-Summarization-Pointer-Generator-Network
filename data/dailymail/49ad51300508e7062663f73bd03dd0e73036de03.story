Hundreds of workers at Coca Cola Amatil warehouses across the country could be hit hard by a new pay structure that sees wages slashed.

In a move the company says brings them closer to the market rate, the beverage giant has penned a deal with it's Victorian workers which sees the implementation of a pay freeze in 2015, while new employees will have to work for 38 percent less than their other colleagues.

A Coca Cola Amatil spokesperson said the idea behind the pay review was to restore the business to sustainable earnings growth. 

Hundreds of workers at Coca Cola Amatil warehouses across the country will be hit hard by a new pay structure that sees wages slashed and pay freezes

Beverage giant, Coca Cola Amatil has penned a deal with it's Victorian workers which sees the implementation of a pay freeze, while new employees will have to work for 38% less.

'Part of our strategic review we have announced four imperatives - strengthening our brand portfolio; optimising revenue management; redesigning the route to market model to better cater to the needs of our customers and reducing the cost base to strengthen our competitive position,' said the spokesperson.

'CCA has an existing EBA covering the Victorian warehouse which has recently been negotiated. This EBA was agreed to by the employees and approved by the Fair Work Commission.'

'These new rates are still above the relevant award. Existing employees under the agreement are not subject to these new rates.'

But the company has said there are no immediate plans to freeze wages across CCA and all current employment arrangements with existing employees remain unchanged. 

ACTU president Ged Kearney believes we are seeing large employers quite emboldened by current government.

'Labour productivity is the strongest in years, but labour growth is low. Cost of living is going up and workers share of the pie keeps getting smaller,' she said.

'Large companies like Coke are putting the burden of their business onto workers.'

Ms Kearney said members had major concerns about their living standards falling behind.

'Nobody wants to see their wages go backwards because you can't afford the ramifications. A job that doesn't help to have a dignified living is not a good job, she said.

Blaming the labor government, Ms Kearney says a raft of legislation right across the board is swinging the power back to employers while workers are left to suffer with less security, pay and lower living standards.

'Research found the way to stimulate the economy is to raise wages, but the Abbott government is thumbing it's nose at that.'

'It's not fair. It does not make economic sense.' 

A two tiered pay system is set to come into play for workers at Coca Cola Amatil's Victorian warehouses, which will see them locked into a pay freeze in 2015

Director of National Workplace Relations at the Australian Industry group, Stephen Smith says there seems to be very modest outcomes across most sectors

'Some enterprise agreements include lesser wages and conditions for new staff, to those enjoyed by current staff,' he said.

'This is a legitimate and sensible approach for companies to take where they have implemented generous wages and conditions in more prosperous times, but find that those wages and conditions are unsustainable for the future given the more difficult operating environment.' 

The new changes provide a stark warning of the pressure on wages across the economy. 

While the average wage in Australia is still growing, incomes aren't growing as fast as they were years ago, according to economists.

'Consumers are more conservative, we've got relatively high currency depressing our export rates, with a soft labour market rising the unemployment market,' said Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk.

'We've come through a period of strong income growth particularly from 2004 to 2008 and we've come through realistically fairly strong in terms of income in the last decade.'

'Income growth is likely to be slower and will continue for a number of years,' he said.

Mr Smirk said GDP(gross domestic product) is linked and circular.

'The better productivity we have the faster GDP growth and the faster income growth,' he said.

'On average some industries grow stronger, other sectors are lagging behind such as manufacturing and tourism services which are under pressure from the Australian dollar but it's mixed across all industries.' 

Daily Mail Australia called the United Voice Union, who represent some members at Coke's Victorian warehouse, but they declined to comment on the issue. 

But Coke are not the only ones to drop their wage increases and implement pay freezes.

Car Manufacturer Holden in Adelaide pressured its workers to accept a wages freeze last year, in a bid to keep the company manufacturing in Australia. 

Kellogg's was also criticised after it tried to persuade workers to open up their workforce agreement to allow reduced wages and conditions to be implemented.
