Laurent Gbagbo, the man who refused to 
step down from power in the Ivory Coast prompting a conflict which killed thousands, has been deemed well enough to face allegations of crimes against humanity.

The former president faces four charges - murder, rape, persecution and inhuman acts - linked to crimes allegedly committed by his supporters as he clung to power following 2010 elections.

He is the first former head of 
state taken into custody by the court in The Hague, Netherlands, since 
it was established in 2002.

A preliminary hearing to assess 
whether prosecutors have enough evidence to merit putting the 
67-year-old on trial was postponed because of his ill health, details of
which have not been released.

The International Criminal Court said on Friday that a panel of medical experts who assessed Gbagbo's health judged he was fit enough to take part in proceedings.

A new date for the evidence hearing has not yet been set.

Ivory Coast was divided into a rebel-controlled north and a loyalist 
south by a 2002-2003 civil war before it was reunited in a 2007 peace deal.

The election was meant to reunify the nation but instead unleashed months of violence.

When Gbagbo refused to accept defeat in last year's presidential election, it prompted further conflict, and the death of thousands of people.

His arrest in April 2011 came after days of heavy fighting during which French and UN helicopters fired rockets at his presidential residence.

The 
long-delayed presidential election was intended to help reunify the 
nation but instead unleashed months of violence.

Gbagbo, who won 46 percent of the 
vote, held power for a decade and already had overstayed his mandate by 
five years when Alassane Ouatarra challenged his incumbency.

When the country's 
election commission and international observers declared he lost the 
election after it was finally held, he refused to step down, despite losing by a near eight-point margin.

The former history professor defied 
near-universal pressure to cede power to Ouattara. The two set up 
parallel administrations that vied for control of the West African 
economic powerhouse.

A bitter power struggle erupted between Gbagbo and Ouatarra in which prosecutors say around 3,000 people 
died in violence by both sides

Some critics accused Gbagbo of clinging to power to avoid prosecution by the International Criminal Court.

months of violence before Ouatarra finally took power in April with the help of French and UN forces.

According to court papers, Gbagbo is charged
as an 'indirect perpetrator' in a carefully orchestrated campaign of 
violence against supporters of Ouattara.

But human rights groups say grave abuses 
were committed by forces loyal to Mr Outtara as well, who enlisted the help of a
former rebel group to oust Gbagbo.

Gbagbo is the sixth suspect taken into custody by the court, all of them in Africa. A further 12 suspects remain at large.
