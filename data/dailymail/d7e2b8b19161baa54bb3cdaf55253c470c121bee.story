An on-dutyÂ New York Police Department traffic officer was struck and killed by a street-cleaning truck in Manhattan this afternoon.

Kalyanarat Ranasinghe, 71, was writing parking tickets when he was hit on East 44th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, about 2.30pm.

A police report states the freight liner vacuum truck pulled away from the kerbside and struck the Bronx resident, pinning him under the wheel. He died at the scene.

Witness Anthony Trinidad said he saw the father-of-one talking on his cellphone when he was hit.

'It was a freak accident,' Trinidad, a doorman at a building on East 44th Street, told Newsday.

'The driver was pulling out and didn't see him. People were yelling for him to stop.'

The 43-year-old driver, who remained at the scene, has not been charged and the investigation is ongoing, police said.

Shortly afterward, his truck was struck 
by a coach bus trying to park in front of the truck. The 25-year-old man
 driving the coach bus also remained at the scene. Neither driver was 
injured.

Robert Cassar, president of the union that represents NYPD traffic agents, said Ranasinghe was issuing parking tickets at the time of the accident.

'He was a very nice man. It's a big deal that we lost him. All the agents are stunned. This doesn't happen very often,' Cassar said.

According to the police report, Ranasinghe was an NYPD Traffic Enforcement Agent Level II. He was appointed on December 21, 2006.

Traffic enforcement agents 
issue summonses to illegally parked cars, direct traffic at 
intersections and perform other traffic related tasks.

Ranasinghe's took
 pride in his job, his son-in-law said.

'He enjoyed it a lot, 
helping people,' said Dananjaya Waragoda, 40. 'Some people asked for 
directions; some asked for help ... He loved his job.'

Waragoda 
said his father-in-law emigrated from Sri Lanka about 20 years ago and 
worked as a telecommunications engineer in Dubai and in New York before 
becoming a traffic enforcement agent almost seven years ago.

He said 
Ranasinghe had been married for over 50 years and had one daughter.

'He
 was a great man, always helping to anybody,' said Waragoda in a 
telephone interview from Ranasinghe's home in the Bronx. 'Whether you 
were a relation or not, it didn't matter to him.'

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the agent's death was 'gut-wrenching'.

'These
 people don't make a lot of money, but they're out there in the middle 
of some heavy traffic, worst possible weather, day and night,' he said.

'So it's a dangerous job, but unfortunately, things like this can sometimes happen.'

Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a 
statement praising traffic enforcement agents and offered his thoughts 
and prayers to the Ranasinghe family.

The holiday weekend is often one of the busiest times of years for traffic enforcement agents, as residents often mistakenly believe parking rules are suspended after Thanksgiving.

In 2008, a traffic enforcement agent who was seven months pregnant was hit and killed by two cars in the Bronx. Doctors were able to deliver her son but he died eight days later.
