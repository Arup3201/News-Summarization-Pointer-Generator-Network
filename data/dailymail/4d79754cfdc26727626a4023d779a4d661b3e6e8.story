Travelers at airports across the U.S. can expect further travel misery this week with the Siberian Express impacting the eastern half of the country predicted to bring two additional cold spells over the coming days.

The cold weather is sweeping south after causing havoc on the northeast with cities as New York and Boston being battered by frequent heavy snowstorms, while the NOAA reports that over half of the U.S. is currently snow-covered.

Temperatures across much of the country are predicted to be 25 to 30 degrees below normal on Monday, according to the National Weather Service and anything from rain to sleet to snow is possible in many areas. 

However there is some good news on the way with the extreme cold expected to ease up next week as we enter March

Fort Worth, Texas: Winter hasn't loosened its grip on the U.S. just yet, as evidenced by freezing rain in North Texas and more arctic air in New England and New York on Monday

New York: Travelers were forced to sleep at JFK International Airport over the weekend after icy weather closed the airport on Sunday morning and crews worked to clear the runways of ice, slush and snow

Additional waves of frigid air will continue to flow southward out of Canada and into the central and eastern United States this week, but there are indications the worst of the cold will ease up next week

Up to an inch of ice is possible in parts of North Texas through late Monday. 

Already, more than 900 flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport have been cancelled in anticipation of another powerful winter storm that is due to hit the south spreading ice, snow and freezing rain. 

Over the weekend travelers were forced to sleep at New York's JFK International Airport after the icy weather closed the airport on Sunday morning and crews worked to clear the runways of ice, slush and snow.

According to Flight Aware, as of 5 pm on Monday more than 2,900 flights are currently delayed because of the weather and some 1,500 are cancelled.

Fortunately there are indications that the worst of the extreme cold will ease up next week.

‘Indications are the pattern will change next week so that the cold is much less severe from the Midwest to the Northeast,’ said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson.

‘Temperatures from the Midwest to the Northeast will still average below normal, but they will be much less extreme.’

Rather than temperatures averaging 20-30 degrees F below normal, temperatures may average 10 F or less below normal. During March, normal temperatures will rise by a degree every few days.

Parts of the South, including Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama, and Charlotte, North Carolina, may break out into some warm early spring weather next week. Highs may in the 60s on a few occasions.

‘The pattern shift will allow frigid air to take aim more at the northern Rockies,’ Anderson said.

As a byproduct of the weather pattern change, a series of storms may track from the Southwest states to the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Valley. The stormy pattern may translate to wintry mix events that transition to rain for the Ohio Valley and Northeast. 

Snow is currently on the ground in at least 48 of 50 U.S. states according to three separate national snow cover maps, reports USA Today.

None of the maps show snow in Florida, but they all differ slightly with regards the other snow free state as the country is pummeled by another cold front.

Depending on which map you consult the other snow free state is either South Carolina, Louisiana or Mississippi.

With snow forecast to fall this week in all three states, Florida could be the only state without snow by the weekend.

In Michigan, Saginaw, Bay City and Midland dropped to 10 below zero early in the day, breaking the area's record of minus 2.

Multiple locations including Boston, New York City, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Chicago are likely to finish the month within the top three coldest Februaries on record. 

In some cases, temperatures for the remainder of the month may deliver the coldest February on record and could rank as the one of the coldest months ever, reports AccuWeather.
