Florida State quarterback and favorite to win the Heisman trophy Jameis Winston has spoken out for the first time after sexual assault charges against him were dropped.

The football player told ESPN that he loves his coach and teammates for standing by him and that he needed to become more mature but was pulled away by his PR people when asked why he had not commented in the past.

It was announced last Thursday by the Florida state's attorney that the 19-year-old player would not be charged with sexual assault due to insufficient evidence, after being accused by a female university student.

Florida State University's star player Jameis Winston spoke out for the first time after sexual assault allegations against him were dropped

The quarterback was part on the winning team on Saturday who beat Duke 45-7 to take a place in the ACC Championship game against Auburn.

In a post-game interview, ESPN reporter Heather Cox quizzed the star quarterback on the dismissed charges. Winston replied that he loved his coach Jimbo Fisher for standing by him and that his team mates also supported him through the allegations.

He added: 'I gotta get more mature. I've gotta get better at everything I do.'

Ms Cox then asked the player: 'How come you decided not to talk during the process and on Thursday?'Â 

The question prompted Winston's media 
handlers to drag him away from the post-game interview and an outraged 
tweet from Winston's attorney Tim Jansen.

Mr Jansen posted: '@heatherespn when u realize ur actions were improper u can make amends. Please write me a note to Jameis and his family to apologize.'

Winston previously released this statement through his lawyer: 'I want to thank my family, friends, coaches and teammates for standing by me during a difficult time.

'I also want to thank the State Attorney's Office for examining all of the facts and reaching a decision in a conclusive matter.

'It's been difficult to stay silent through this process, but I never lost faith in the truth and in who I am.

'I'm very relieved I'll be able to continue my education at Florida State and I'm excited I can now get back to helping our team achieve its goals.'

Many Heisman voters had waited to see whether Winston would be charged with a crime before casting their ballots.

The deadline for ballots is today at 5pm and the trophy, college football's most prestigious individual trophy, is awarded on December 14.
