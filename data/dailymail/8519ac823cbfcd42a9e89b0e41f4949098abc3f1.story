Austin Hudson-LaPore: The body of the 20-year-old University of Chicago junior was found a week after his disappearance

The body of a University of Chicago 
student who disappeared a week ago was found on Wednesday morning by a 
man fishing in Lake Michigan.

Family members helped confirm Austin Hudson-Lapore's identity at the Cook County medical examiner's office.

An autopsy is due at some time on Thursday, after which his family are expected to speak.

During a tearful public plea last 
Friday, two days after Hudson-Lapore's disappearance, his father said 
his son was fascinated by weather and speculated that he might have 
dashed out of his apartment with nothing but his keys to watch the 
storms that had rolled into the city that night.

The man who found Hudson-Lapore's 
body had gone to the lake to fish Wednesday morning and had cast only 
one line when he looked to his right and noticed the body in the water.

'I saw a body, which I thought was a 
log,' Eddie Hudson, 65, told the Chicago Tribune. 'And I walked a little
bit closer, then I thought it was a dummy. …I discovered it wasn't a 
dummy and then I called 911.'

A powerful storm system passed through
the Midwest on June 12, bringing torrential rains, gusty winds, hail 
and lightning to the area.

A
missing persons report had described Hudson-LaPore as weighing 110lbs 
and standing at 5 feet 7 inches, with blond hair, blue eyes and a fair 
complexion. He was last seen wearing blue jeans and black sneakers.

Pragmatic: Austin's family say the 20-year-old biochemistry major left the house without his cell phone and wallet on his way to watch a storm because he didn't want them to get wet

Well-adjusted: Austin's parents said their son 
had just finished his final exam on the afternoon that he went missing and was excited 
about starting work at a university lab

According
to the missing student’s family, the junior majoring in biochemistry 
had just finished his final exam last Wednesday afternoon.

On
Friday, the missing man's loved ones appealed to the public for help in
finding Austin. His friends appeared emotional, sobbing and hugging one
another as they talked about the junior.

According
to those close to Austin, the biochemistry student was planning to 
start working at a lab on campus so he could spend his last summer of 
college with his friends.

Relatives
say Hudson-Lapore is a former National Science Bowl contender with a 
passion for meteorology. He was described as being upbeat, outdoorsy and
no the type to vanish without an explanation.

Hudson-LaPore's disappearance comes just days after another University of Chicago student had gone missing.

Naomi
Knight, 18, a special needs student suffering from a bi-polar disorder,
was last seen Monday morning on South Woodlawn Avenue.
