Jailed: McGrath was sent to prison for 22 months after admitting dangerous driving, endangering rail passengers and aggravated vehicle taking

A boy racer jumped out of a moving car as it rolled over a level crossing just yards from the front of a departing train.

Ricky McGrath, 22, was trying to evade police when he leapt from the driver's seat on the wrong side of the road.

The 22-year-old was jailed for 22 months at Norwich Crown Court yesterday.

Judge Stephen Holt said it 
was a miracle his ‘terrifying driving’ had not killed anyone.

After he jumped clear the black Audi 
A4 rolled under the descending barrier 65ft in front of a 
train which was just about to leave the platform at Watlington station.

The
empty car only just made it under the nearest barrier, which was 
descending, before coming to a halt under the far side barrier.

First
Capital Connect, which runs the train services through Watlington near 
King's Lynn, Norfolk, said luck had stopped him causing a 'major 
accident'.

Police 
pursued McGrath on September 30 after spotting him overtake at speed in a
30mph zone and reach speeds up to 70mph in the borrowed Audi.

Dangerous: McGrath was on the wrong side of the road when he jumped out

Leap: In the CCTV image McGrath can be seen jumping from the moving Audi as he was followed by two policemen

Lucky: McGrath runs over the crossing despite the barriers closing as a train prepares to depart just 20 metres away

Chase: McGrath reaches the other side safely but his trailing car, both highlighted, gets trapped in the barriers. Train company First Capital Connect said his 'reckless actions could have caused a major accident'

Reckless: The Audi is allowed to slowly roll across the tracks. Judge Holt said: 'Had a train ploughed into the car, one shudders to think what would have happened.'

CCTV images taken by cameras at the 
station show McGrath, who has 16 previous convictions, jump from the car
and then run ahead of the moving vehicle over the crossing.

Other
images show police in pursuit stopping their patrol cars and running 
after McGrath although they did not follow him over the tracks.

McGrath of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, admitted dangerous driving, endangering rail passengers and aggravated vehicle taking.

He also admitted escaping from custody after fleeing the dock during his first hearing after arrest.

He was also banned from driving for three years at the hearing yesterday.

A
First Capital Connect spokesman said: 'Luckily no-one was hurt. But 
this man’s reckless action could have caused a major accident, injuring 
or claiming the lives of scores of people.'

'Terrifying': The empty car came to rest trapped under the barriers. Judge said it is a miracle no one was killed by Ricky McGrath's 'terrifying driving'

Trains were delayed for up to 13 minutes after he abandoned the car at the level crossing.

Judge Holt told McGrath he had an ‘appalling record’ for someone who was still only aged 22.

He
added: 'You were not to know whether a train was coming or not. Had a 
train ploughed into the car, one shudders to think what would have 
happened.'

Prosecutor Nick 
Methold said that McGrath had tried to get away by leaping from the 
moving vehicle as he drove up to the level crossing.

He said: 'The barriers were 
coming down and the car continued underneath the barriers. He got out of
the car while it was still moving and the car went through without him 
in it.

'It went through the first set of barriers and nearly the second set of barriers when there was a train at the station.'

McGrath was later arrested and brought before King’s Lynn magistrates the next day, but he fled from the dock.

He was recaptured seven days later when he was stopped in a car on the A17 at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire.

McGrath
also took a VW Golf on July 27 this year and drove it at up to 115mph 
on the A47 in Cambridgeshire before police used a stinger device to 
puncture his tyres and stop him.

He was pursued by police for ten miles and drove at 90mph as he overtook a line of cars, forcing oncoming traffic to swerve.

He also drove at 80mph through a 40mph zone.

Andrew
Cogan, defending, said McGrath was a 'realist' and knew he would be 
going to prison, but he deserved credit for his guilty pleas.

He
said 'There is no suggestion whatever there was any driving under the 
influence of any sort of substance, whether it be drugs or drink.'

McGrath
was jailed for four months for escaping custody, nine months for 
dangerous driving and a further nine months for aggravated vehicle 
taking, all to run consecutively

He was sentenced to nine months, to run concurrently, for endangering rail passengers and ordered to pay £100 costs.
