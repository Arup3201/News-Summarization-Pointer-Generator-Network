Boris Johnson’s spat with Nick Clegg took a tasteless turn yesterday after he described the Deputy Prime Minister as David Cameron’s condom.

The Mayor of London said the Lib Dem leader served as a ‘prophylactic protection device’ to shield the PM when he makes decisions that ‘cheese’ people off.

The two men, who both take part in regular phone-in shows on London radio station LBC have repeatedly taken potshots at one another in the past, with Mr Clegg branding the mayor a ‘slacker’ for only hosting a monthly call-in on the station while Mr Johnson claimed the Deputy PM was an ‘idle bum’.

Ongoing battle: Johnson called Clegg a 'lapdog-cum-prophylactic protection device' on LBC radio in latest jibe

Mr Johnson was pressed about his views on Mr Clegg’s criticism yesterday of Chancellor George Osborne’s announcement that £12billion of new cuts to benefits will be needed following next year’s general election.

The potential future Conservative leadership candidate told the station: ‘I don’t want to get into some sort of endless ding dong with poor old Cleggers.

‘He’s there to fulfil a very important ceremonial function as David Cameron’s lapdog-cum-prophylactic protection device for all the difficult things that David Cameron has to do that cheese off the rest of the...’

Presenter Nick Ferrari interjected saying he had ‘never heard it called that before’ prompting the Mayor to reply ‘you know what I mean’.

Mr Johnson said: ‘He’s a kind of shield, he’s a lapdog who has been skinned and turned into a shield to protect the [Prime Minister].’

It is the latest spat in a public rivalry between the pair, with the Mayor previously describing Mr Clegg as a ‘wobbling jelly of indecision and vacillation’.

The Deputy Prime Minister hit back by saying that if they were ever to have a beer together ‘I’d probably pour the drink over his blonde mop’.

Last night a source close to Mr Clegg said: ‘Boris needs to make up his mind. Half the time he’s moaning that we are blocking policies and half the time we’re a lapdog.

‘All he’s done for the people of London is put his name to Ken Livingstone’s bike plan and bang on about a fantasy airport. He should focus on the day job, not the job he wants to have.’
