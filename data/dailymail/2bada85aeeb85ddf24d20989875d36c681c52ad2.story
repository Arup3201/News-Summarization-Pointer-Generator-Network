A New York man who was arrested for shoplifting appears to have modeled his mouth on the Joker character Heath Ledger played in 2008's The Dark Knight.

Anthony MacDowell, 20, of Utica was charged with petit larceny after he allegedly was seen taking $620.07 worth of merchandise from a Walmart. 

The misdemeanor charge is punishable by up to one year in jail.

Store security workers told the Utica Police Department that when they tried to stop MacDowell from taking the merchandise, he fled. 

A police officer found the young man in a nearby Bass Pro Shop and arrested him. 

The UPD posted MacDowell's mugshot on Facebook and people began to realize his resemblance to the iconic Batman characteR.

The 28-year-old actor was posthumously given an Academy Award for his performance. 

The first person to comment on the department's post quoted a line from the film: 'Why so serious?'

Many more people followed that remark with jokes about MacDowell's appearance. 

The distinctive facial cuts are known as a Glasgow Smile.

MacDowell is a fan of films such as Fight Club, Saw, Jackass and V For Vendetta, according to his Facebook page. 

He does not list The Dark Knight or any of the other Batman films in his favorites. 

He does however apparently enjoy Eminem, System of a Down and the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, as well as The Gathering of the Juggalos, the annual festival put on by the Insane Clown Posse.
