This is the dramatic new footage which shows the world's most wanted terrorist for the first time since he masterminded an attack on an Algerian gas facility which killed six Britons in January.

In the Al Qaeda video the one-eyed fugitive Mokhtar Belmokhtar helps a soldier to hold a rocket propelled grenade launcher.

Belmokhtar, 41, who has a Â£3.3million bounty
on his head, also addresses the camera before being pictured kneeling 
with fellow terrorists and talking to them.

The world's most wanted terrorist dubbed 'the uncatchable' has appeared in a new video

Trained to kill: In the video he shows a trainee terrorist how to use a rocket launcher

At the end of the two minute clip he embraces each smiling militant in turn.

Intelligence agents from Britain, the US and Europe are sure to be studying every second of the film for anything that might provide them with information as to his whereabouts.

An intelligence source said: 'Photos and footage of fugitives are always of great interest. Evidence of appearances and associations can be vital in tracking down even the most elusive of individuals.'

Belmokhtar is thought to be on the run somewhere in Lybia as the country recovers from its uprising.

Wednesday Jan 16 - Terrorists attack two buses carrying workers into the plant killing two, including one Briton, before driving to the plant's living area and taking hostages.

Thursday Jan 17 - Algerian forces attack as the militants try to move hostages, and as a result several innocent people are killed

Friday Jan 18 - A stalemate develops as Algerian forces surround the compound

Saturday Jan 19 - Algerians attack again after reports that hostages were being killed

Sunday Jan 20 - Siege ends as Algerian military reports bodies of burned hostages found at plant while several remain unaccounted for

Though Belmokhtar has been fighting for Islamic organisations in Algeria, Africa, since 1992, he only came to prominence after he claimed responsibility for a deadly assault on the BP co-owned In Amenas gas plant.

In January his troops stormed the facility carrying machine guns and grenades, killing one Briton in the process.

They then strapped semtex explosives to the necks of other Western hostages, claiming they had only come for the Christians, while allegedly treating Muslim Algerians with kindness.

They then surrounded the plant with mines before demanding France halt its attacks on rebels in neighbouring Mali.

After days of tense negotiating Algerian special forces stormed the compound in a widely criticised operation which killed 29 militants and 37 foreign captives.

Belmokhtar posted a video at the time of the attack saying: 'We in Al Qaeda announce this blessed operation.'

Four months later his soldiers carried out two suicide bombings in Niger, followed by an explosion in a military base in Agadez which killed 20 soldiers and wounded 16.

Another bomb at a French mine in Arlit killed one and injured another 14.

Nicknamed 'Mr Marlboro' after making a fortune smuggling cigarettes across the Sahara, the senior terrorist is one of the most fearsome warlords in the Sarah, having been involved in a string of kidnappings and ransom demands dating back to 2003.

Dubbed 'the uncatchable' by French security forces he was thought to have been killed in a combined French and Chadian army operation when they destroyed a terrorist base in March.

DNA tests later showed the body to be that of Abou Zeid, another senior Al Qaeda figure.

Belmokhtar was sentenced by an Algerian court to life imprisonment in absentia in connection with the killing of 10 Algerian customs agents in 2007.

A UK coroner's investigation into the Algerian massacre is under way.
