A 56-year-old Italian man could face criminal charges after he sparked an Ebola scare on board a commercial airliner travelling from Milan to Dublin.

Investigators said the man and two women were arrested after a passenger on board the Aer Lingus flight showed a flight attendant a plastic cup marked with the words ‘Attentione Ebola'.

After the air steward notified the captain and the Airbus A320 was put under emergency lockdown when it landed at Dublin Airport as medics were called to the scene.

Around 150 passengers and crew were forced to remain isolated on board flight EI433 on the runway apron for an hour while three of the passengers were medically examined.

Airport police placed a cordon at the aircraft, which was parked at a stand. 

Ireland's health service, the Health Service Executive, was also called in but an examination in consultation with experts established there was no evidence of a health risk.

Crew and passengers were allowed to disembark and the cordon was removed once the incident was determined to be a hoax.
