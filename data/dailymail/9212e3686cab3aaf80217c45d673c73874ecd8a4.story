Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell held a press conference Tuesday night following a federal indictment on political corruption charges.

Authorities announced today that McDonnell and his wife, former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell, illegally accepted luxury clothes, free vacations, large loans and private planes rides from wealthy Richmond businessman Jonnie R Williams .

Flanked by his wife, daughter and son-in-law, McDonnell strongly denied the allegations in the press conference, saying he 'did nothing illegal' and will fight the more than 14 charges.

He said that federal prosecutors were 
'stretching the law to breaking point' and that if he is convicted, every
 politician 'from President Obama on down would have to be charged with 
giving tangible benefits to donors'.

McDonnell did apologize for the 'poor judgement' he used in 'accepting legal gifts and loans'. He says he regrets taking the loans but everything he accepted from Williams has been returned or repaid with interest.

'I come to you as someone who has been falsely and wrongfully accused and whose public service has been wrongfully,'attacked McDonnell said.

He stressed that Mr Williams was 'never promised and never received any government benefit of any kind from me or my administration'.

Williams, he said, received 'not one penny' of taxpayer money, nor did Star Scientific Inc, the dietary supplement company Williams used to be chief executive of.

He said that prosecutors are operating under a 'misguided legal theory' that stipulates that facilitating an introduction, meetings, appearing at a reception or expressing support for a Virginia business 'is a serious federal crime'.

But McDonnell said he has faith in the American justice system and believes the courts will rule in his favor.

'I believe the facts and the law are clearly on our sides.'

He described the months-long investigation as 'agonizing' and the 'most difficult and unexpected ordeal of my life'. 

McDonnell ended the press conference by saying that serving as governor was  the 'highest professional honor of my life'.

McDonnell and his wife Maureen are due in court Friday morning for a bond hearing.

Bob McDonnell has also been charged with
 an additional count of making a false statement to a financial 
institution, and Maureen McDonnell is charged with one count of 
obstruction of an official proceeding.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman said in a news release. 'Ensuring that elected officials uphold the public's trust is one of our most critical responsibilities.'

'Today's charges represent the Justice 
Department's continued commitment to rooting out public corruption at 
all levels of government,'

McDonnell left office earlier this month after four years in the governor's office. Virginia law limits governors to a single term.

A federal investigation overshadowed the final months in office for the once-rising star of the Republican Party, with authorities looking into gifts he and his family received from a political donor.

In July, McDonnell apologized and 
said he had returned more than $120,000 in loans and other gifts from 
Johnnie Williams, the CEO of pharmaceutical company Star Scientific.

He
 insisted that he had done nothing illegal on behalf of Star Scientific 
but said he'd do 'things differently today than choices I made a couple 
of years ago.'

The scandal unfolded around the same 
time as a separate politically embarrassing case involving a former 
executive mansion chef who was accused of embezzlement and, in turn, 
accused McDonnell's children of taking mansion food and supplies for 
personal use.

The governor later reimbursed the state.

The fallout seeped into the general election, with McDonnell playing a low-key role in support of Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe.

Asked why he hadn't been more visible, McDonnell replied, 'That's a question for the candidate.'

McDonnell, 59, is the first governor ever to face criminal charges in Virginia.

Gov McDonnell was accused of used the influence of his office to promote Star Scientific's anti-inflammatory supplement, Anatabloc, for Jonnie R. Williams Sr and his company.

Jeanine McDonnell, daughter of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, received a $10,000 engagement check from Williams

They contributed more than $100,000 to McDonnell's political organizations and gave the governor's family personal gifts worth thousands of dollars.

Some of the 'luxury items' were said to include cosmetic dentistry work for the mother-of-five, as well as jewelry and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree for Maureen.

The governor made a public apology in July and repaid $50,000 in loans as well as another $70,000 loan made to a small business McDonnell set up with his sister.

He then returned what he called 'tangible' gifts his family accepted from Williams.

According to a person close to the McDonnells and familiar with the PAC's operations, Maureen had complained to the committee she did not have enough funds to keep up the style she believed a first lady should uphold.

The family were allegedly struggling after their finances were hit by the real estate market and properties they bought totaling $3.84million lost value.

Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card after she made the complaint, according to the source.

Indeed, in August, McDonnell announced on his hourm long monthly show on Washington's WTOP radio that he is working with his private legal team to return all gifts still in his family's possession to Williams.

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, however, said he won't return Williams' gifts or reimburse him for their reported $18,000 value because they include vacations, dinners and private jet travel - not things that can be given back.

There are some bells you can't un-ring. You can't un-take an airplane flight,' Cuccinelli said. '...I didn't get loans, didn't get cash, didn't get shopping sprees.'

Maureen McDonnell spent $6,000 around the time of Bob McDonnell's January 2010 inauguration and complained to the PAC the family did not have enough to finance her first lady wardrobe

Asked why he wouldn't reimburse Williams for the gifts' value, he said because, 'No money changed hands.'

Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee to succeed McDonnell as governor, disclosed his gifts from Williams on his required statements of economic interest, although he accepted some of them years before they were reported.

Cuccinelli amended four years' worth of financial disclosure reports in April, listing a $3,000 family vacation and a $1,500 catered Thanksgiving dinner at Williams' luxury waterfront villa on Virginia's Smith Mountain Lake among items he had earlier overlooked.

McDonnell's gifts from Williams, however, came to light through weeks of news reports, not his own economic interest filings.

His gifts were more numerous and more tangible, including a $6,500 Rolex watch inscribed to the '71st governor of Virginia,' the check for 28-year-old daughter Cailin, and a $10,000 engagement check for daughter Jeanine, 32, before her May wedding. Both wedding gifts have already been returned, McDonnell said.

Spokesman for the governor and first lady Rich Galen told the Washington Post in July that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the expensive clothes and they would be donated to charity once her husband's term is complete

'I am working with my counsel to return gifts that have been given,' McDonnell said. 'My eldest daughter returned her engagement gift and my daughter Cailin has returned her wedding gift, and there are other substantial items that are in the process of being returned, and I'll let you know more when I do.'

In July, McDonnell said he had repaid nearly $125,000 in personal and business loans that Williams made, and the governor, through his private legal and public relations team, issued an apology to Virginians.

The governor did not disclose either the loan from Williams or gifts from him which candidates and public officeholders are required to file annually broadly sketching out their personal finances.

McDonnell, entering the final five months of the single, non-renewable term to which Virginia uniquely limits its governors, defended his decision not to report the gifts, noting that the state's ethics laws compel disclosure only of gifts given directly to officeholders or candidates themselves, not to their immediate families.

The McDonnells, both 59 years old, believe they have done nothing illegal and plan to fight the charges in court, they said in separate statements through their lawyers.

McDonnell, a Republican, said in July he had repaid $120,000 in loans from Jonnie Williams, a major campaign donor and the founder of Star Scientific. He also apologized for the embarrassment the gifts and loans to him and his family had caused Virginia.

Williams resigned as Star Scientific chief executive in December.

McDonnell had acknowledged that he and his family received more than $160,000 in gifts and loans from Williams.

The gifts from Williams ranged from a $6,500 Rolex watch for McDonnell, to wedding and engagement presents and money for his daughters, and a $15,000 shopping spree for first lady Maureen McDonnell.

A spokeswoman for Star Scientific did not immediately return a call requesting comment.
