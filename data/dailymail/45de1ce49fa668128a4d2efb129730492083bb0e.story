When you're getting up to no good at work, it's best to avoid having your picture taken - as this Spanish gravedigger recently discovered.

The man, identified only as Clemente, posed for a creepy photo while propping up the corpse of a man who had been dead for 23 years.

The other man grinning in the picture is  thought to be the deceased's nephew-in-law, while the dead man's niece took the picture on her phone.

Digging a hole: The gravedigger, named only as Clemente, has been suspended after posing for a photo with the corpse of man who died 23 years ago.

The man's body had been exhumed as his grave was being extended so his recently deceased wife could be added to the tomb, reports The Local.

Clemente was pictured wearing his official blue polo shirt emblazoned with the town's coat-of-arms - a fact which will have infuriated officials at the town hall in Guardamar del Segura, near Alicante.

After taking the spooky photo, the niece sent it to other family members, who then posted it to social media.

Unsurprisingly, it was shared numerous times and seen by thousands of people, leading to an investigation by the town's civil guard, who suspended the gravedigger from his duties.

A municipal representative said: 'It was silliness with no justification whatsoever and we will have to take a decision'.

Felipe Aldeguer, an elected official from the town, told ABC that the incident was 'unpleasant, miserable', but he added that the digger 'had not acted in bad faith'.

Clemente must now wait to see whether he will be allowed to continue his job.
