Barack Obama is to meet gay activists during his G20 visit to Russia in what is being viewed as a snub to Vladimir Putin's controversial new equality laws that outlaw 'homosexual propaganda'.

As Obama prepared to meet Russia's civil society leaders, including some gay activists, after meeting leaders at the G20 summit, about two dozen activists rallied in St Petersburg to protest against the law.

In June, Putin signed a bill that classified 'homosexual 
propaganda' as pornography and provides for fines and arrest for those 
making it accessible to minors.

The same legislation gave the national
government the authority to detain gay or 'pro-gay' foreigners for up 
to 14 days, and then to expel them from the country.

The laws also have caused some concern among athlethes who will be heading to Russia for the 2014 Olympic Winter Games.

Today's rally went on peacefully under the close watch of several hundred riot police, who separated the protesters from a few dozen anti-gay demonstrators at the G20 summit.

Participants held placards with signs such as 'Stop homophobia in Russia' and chanted 'Putin lies' - a reference to the Russian president's denial that the new law infringes gay rights.

One of the protesters, Kirill Kalugin, said police protection of the rally was a 'show intended for the Group of 20 leaders'.

The law has already been enacted on a series of occasions throughout Russia in recent weeks.

Last week police seized a painting of Vladamir Putin wearing women's underwear from a gallery, saying the satirical display had broken the law.

The painting entitled 'Travesty' by Konstantin Altunin, shows President Putin wearing a tight-fitting slip and brushing the hair of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who is wearing knickers and a bra.

Police swooped on the Muzei Vlasti (Museum of Authorities) in St Petersburg on the night of August 26 confiscating several art installations, including 'Travesty' which are to be checked for extremist propaganda.

A picture of the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill I, with his torso covered in tattoos, and two others poking fun at lawmakers who have backed legislation banning so-called gay propaganda, were also confiscated, gallery staff said.
