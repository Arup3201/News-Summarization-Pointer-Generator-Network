Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes is yet to hear from the club’s new manager Louis van Gaal and feels it is 'probably a bit too late now' in terms of being offered a coaching position by them.

Scholes was part of the United coaching staff at the end of last season when Ryan Giggs took over on an interim basis following the dismissal of David Moyes.

It had been understood the Red Devils were keen for Scholes to have a role again, but that was cast into doubt this week as it emerged the 39-year-old has signed up to be a pundit for both BT Sport and ITV over the 2014-15 campaign.

And asked on Wednesday what the situation was with him and United, Scholes - an ambassador for Men United v Prostate Cancer, speaking at a promotional event for the campaign - said: “It’s no different.

'I have not spoken to the new manager and there is no need for him to speak to me really.

'I only helped Ryan for a few weeks at the end of the season and I wasn’t on a contract.

'I didn’t have a job with the club and that is no different now.'

Then asked if he would be interested if an offer was forthcoming from United, Scholes said: 'It is probably a bit too late now. I couldn’t wait around forever.

'I had the offers from television, I had to make my mind up if I wanted to take them on and I’ve decided to go ahead with them.

'Whether something might come from United in the future, I don’t know, but it is not something I’m waiting for.'
