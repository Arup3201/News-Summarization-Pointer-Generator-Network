West Ham's in-form striker Diafra Sakho faces up to a month on the sideline with a shoulder injury.

The Senegalese was substituted late on after picking up the knock during the Hammers' impressive 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Upton Park on Saturday.

If Sakho is out for a month he would miss West Ham's matches against Stoke, Aston Villa and Everton.

The 24-year-old was given a standing ovation by the West Ham faithful when substituted having grabbed the winner with a powerful header which City goalkeeper Joe Hart was unable to prevent crossing the line.

The striker was Sakho's seventh in as many games and made him only the second player after Micky Quinn to net in his first six Premier League starts.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce will be hoping the early prognosis is exaggerated and that Sakho will be able to resume his fruitful partnership with fellow summer-signing Enner Valencia sooner rather than later.

A £4.5million signing from Ligue 2 side Metz, Sakho was one of West Ham's lower-profile summer recruits but he has quickly become one of the fans' favourites.

It will be a serious blow to Allardyce and his side, who sit fourth in the Premier League.

In fact, Sakho's start has been so impressive that the club are already looking to offer him a contract with improved terms just two-and-a-half months into the season to deter potential suitors.
