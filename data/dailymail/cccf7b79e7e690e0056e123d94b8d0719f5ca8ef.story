A 19-year-old woman died yesterday after falling from a sixth-storey college dorm window.

Police said Stephanie Ann Lehr was trying to climb onto a rooftop from the room on the University of Minnesota campus when she fell.

The Hennepin County medical examiner found she died of blunt-force injuries.

University of Minnesota authorities said a screen had been removed from the window before the accident

She fell from the window into a courtyard at Yudof Hall about 4:30pm on Saturday and was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died the following day.

Police, who said they are treating the death as an accident, say Miss Lehr was trying to reach a gravel rooftop about three feet away when she fell.

She was not a university student and her friend was the only other person in the room at the time.

A screen had been removed from a window before the accident. 

Tim Busse, communications director for University Services, told The Star Tribune that the screens were not designed to be removed.

Miss Lehr was taken to hospital after falling onto the courtyard but died the following day

He told the newspaper: 'We take safety very seriously for our students and those who come to visit our campus. This wasn't a safe thing to do.'

Authorities say Miss Lehr's friend has been moved to another room.

The Star Tribune reports alcohol was found in the room, but police are awaiting the results of tests to determine if Miss Lehr had drunk any.

A university spokesperson said in a statement: 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family and friends.

'We hope students will use this as a reminder to be protective and caring of their friends and classmates', according to the Star Tribune.
