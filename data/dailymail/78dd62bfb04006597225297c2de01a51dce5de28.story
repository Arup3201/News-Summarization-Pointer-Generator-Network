A have-a-go-hero father was smashed over the head with a mallet by a gang of teenagers when he tried to stop them burgling his neighbour's house. 

Andrew Bishop, 56, heard a commotion in his street in Sidcup, south east London, and went to investigate when he was attacked by the five youths, said to be speaking in Irish accents.

He suffered a deep gash to his head but still managed to wrestle a broom handle from one of the boys and they fled the scene in a red or orange Ford Focus ST.

Have-a-go hero, Andrew Bishop, heard a commotion at a neighbour's house in Sidcup, south east London, and went to investigate when he was attacked by a gang of youths, who hit him with a mallet

Photographs of his horrific injuries were posted on social media by his 18-year-old daughter as a warning to other residents.

Marnie Bishop said: 'My dad is my hero, he wrestled the burglars and got smacked over the head.

'Hate seeing someone I love so much hurt. Hopefully the little scumbags get caught.'

Following the incident at around 6.45pm on January 6, Mr Bishop was taken to a south London hospital where he received treatment for the head injury, which was not life-threatening.

The suspects are all described as white men, believed to be in their late teens or early 20s, and it is not known whether anything was taken from the house, thought to be worth around £300,000.

They are understood to be targeting homes in the Sidcup and Blackfen areas and knocking on doors, then asking for directions to see if people are in and as a distraction to see where keys are.

A police spokesman said: 'Detectives in Bexley are appealing for information and witnesses after a man was assaulted after challenging burglars at his neighbour's house.

'Police were called to reports of a man being assaulted in Sidcup at 6:45pm on Tuesday.

'Officers attended the scene and found a 56-year-old man suffering from a head injury.'

Anyone with any information should call Bexley police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
