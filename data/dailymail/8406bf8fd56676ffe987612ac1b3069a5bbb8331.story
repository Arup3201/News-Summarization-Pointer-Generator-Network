A former design school employee accused of leaking details of a $60,000 scholarship to the daughter of Prime Minister Tony Abbott has filed a legal claim with the Fair Work Commission.

The Whitehouse Institute of Design's chief executive officer Ian Tudor confirmed to the Daily Mail Australia that an 'adverse action case' by a former employee was to be heard by the workplace relations tribunal.

The complaint was filed by the former employee who had been investigated by the school after it was reported Frances Abbott had been given the chairman's scholarship worth $60,636, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Mr Tudor told the Daily Mail Australia the institute was 'confident that the adverse action case is without merit and has no prospect of success'.

'The former employee concerned was subject to an internal disciplinary review and resigned before that review was complete,' he said in a statement.

'Given that the matter is currently before the Fair Work Commission, we will be making no further comment.'

In May, it was revealed Mr Abbott's second daughter had won the prestigious chairman's scholarship to the Whitehouse Institute of Design. The school, which has campuses in Sydney and Melbourne, has Liberal supporter Les Taylor as chairman of its board of governors.

The former employee of the school who lodged the case was investigated for a student confidentiality breach

The revelations Frances Abbott received the 2011 scholarship caused controversy was it was revealed in May because Mr Abbott did not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register - despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events.

Mr Abbott has maintained that he had no reason to declare the scholarship because his daughter won it on merit.

A school spokesman told The Sydney Morning Herald that the employee was investigated for a breach in student confidentiality, but did not name the student in question. It was revealed to Fairfax media by a source that it was Frances Abbott.

Fair Work Commission vice-president Joe Catanzariti will be overseeing the case within weeks and the employee who filed the complaint is believed to be represented by the same legal team who handled James Ashby's sexual harassment allegations against former speaker Peter Slipper, Harmers Workplace Lawyers, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The Prime Minister's office, Harmers Workplace Lawyers and the Fair Work Commission have been contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment.
