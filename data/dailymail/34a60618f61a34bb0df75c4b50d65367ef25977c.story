Bitter winds, sub-zero temperatures and even snow are predicted for this Bank Holiday weekend - in marked contrast to last year's sunny scenes.

And for those longing for a dose of summer, there's even more bad news: the unseasonably bad weather could last until June.

Last year's May Bank Holiday saw temperatures up to 77F (25c), but barbecues and beach trips will be off the agenda this year after the mercury plummeted to minus 4C in Scotland overnight, with the rest of the UK experiencing lower than average readings until Monday.

Some forecasters predicted this was set to be the coldest start to May for more than 70 years, with cloud is set to hang over the southern parts of Britain over the course of this weekend with wintry snow and sleet showers falling in the North.  The Met Office said the mercury fell early this morning to -7.4C at Cairngorm, Highland, -6.2C at Saughall, Ayrshire, and -4.4C at Shap, Cumbria.

May lowest temperature records were broken by at least four stations: Saughall, Carterhouse, Roxburghshire, Drumalbin, South Lanarkshire, and Spadeadam Cumbria. Records began in 1995 or earlier.

Seaside resorts including Bournemouth were deserted in bitter lunchtime temperatures in the south of 6-8C - up to 10C colder than normal.

Today: Patchy rain in the far south and southeast clearing by early afternoon. Sunny spells elsewhere with scattered showers. Maximum 12C (54F).

Tomorrow: Bright and chilly with scattered showers. Cloudier again in the Southeast. Maximum 12C (54F).

Monday: Slightly milder but low pressure forecast to bring rain from the West. Highs of 13C (55F).

And the Met Office's long-range forecast
warns of unsettled weather to the middle of May, with showers, a risk 
of snow in higher ground in the north and risks of gales, adding: 
'Temperatures will initially be largely below the seasonal average 
across the UK at first, so still a risk of grass frost in any clearer 
interludes overnight.'

Later in the month, the experts predict rain and cloud are predicted to be 'more likely to be above average than below average, whilst mean temperatures are more likely to be below average than above average.'

The dismal outlook for the long weekend follows weeks of wet weather that brought floods to widespread areas of Britain, and saw this April crowned the wettest since records began by the Met Office.

Officials at the Environment Agency have warned that many roads and fields are still under water.

A spokesman said: 'We continuing to keep a close watch on river levels as well as checking defences and clearing any potential blockages to reduce the risk of flooding.

'There is still a lot of flood water around and the Environment Agency is urging people to keep away from swollen rivers, and not attempt to walk or drive through them.'

Tourist resorts said they did not have high hopes for takings over the weekend, while the AA predicted many would stay at home due to the recent 'foul' weather.

Claire Smith, president of Stay Blackpool, said: 'It's not looking like a fab Bank Holiday. People only have so much money to spend and it's not that long since Easter. I also think people are making plans for the Jubilee weekend.

'The weather's very random at the moment so this is perhaps not going to be our best.'

And a Bournemouth seafront spokesperson said: 'It's cold, horrible, windy and very quiet. The few people that are here are wearing coats, hats and scarves - quite a contrast to a sunny Bank Holiday weekend.'

Bournemouth area hospitality association chairman Andrew Woodland said: 'Visitor spend will be way down, with a fall of around £1million compared to a good weather weekend.'

An AA spokesman said: 'We don't think there will be significant getaways of traffic. A lot of people will be staying at home and doing their own thing.

'The weather's been so foul over the last month, I doubt many people have made plans to head off.

'It discourages people from going out and if people are staying at home it's going to be more of a DIY weekend than a travelling to the seaside one.

'People aren't going to be travelling long distances.'

Gardeners have been advised to either take vulnerable plants indoors or wrap them with horticultural fleece because of the threat of frost.

Richard Willford, horticultural manager at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, told the Daily Telegraph: 'If they are in beds there is not a lot you can do other than put horticultural fleece over them, held down with stones ... And cross your fingers.'

The RSPB said bird populations would fall after thousands of nests were destroyed by floods in Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, West Sussex and West Yorkshire. Spokesman Jon Reeves said: 'It’s devastating.'

MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, predicted a chilly holiday.

Forecaster Billy Payne said: 'Temperatures are quite a few degrees down on what they should be for this time of year so it doesn't look like it's going to be beach weather.

'This morning will get off to a cold start with quite a lot of cloud bubbling up mixed with showers and some bright and sunny spells.

'A front will be lingering over the South so it will be mostly cloudy with patchy rain and drizzle there.

'There will also be some wintry showers in Scotland and northern England with snow falling over higher ground.'

Mr Payne said the mercury will be dipping close to, or just below, zero tonight in most parts of the UK, with a widespread frost setting in during the early hours of tomorrow morning.

Daytime temperatures are expected to climb no higher than 12C over the next two days, with areas in the North East dropping to 5C.

Monday is expected to be slightly milder but low pressure is forecast to bring rain from the West.

The South West in particular could see heavy downpours, it was predicted - spelling bad news for ice-cream vendors and good news for DIY stores.

There were 9 flood warnings and 51 flood alerts in place on the Environment Agency website.
