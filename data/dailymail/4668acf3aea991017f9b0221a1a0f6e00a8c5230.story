Wrapping up warm should be easy this winter. Women have never had such a huge choice of coat styles to wear. Plenty of choice for a woman looking to make a style statement, surely. But beware. Femail has identified the seven coat shapes dominating the shops this winter, and not all of them are flattering to your curves. Big coats dominate.

While we women spend hours worrying about whether our jeans make our bottoms look big, or whether our blouses make our arms look chubby, we don't pay as much attention to our outerwear and that's a mistake. The wrong coat could make you look much larger.

At first glance, these big beauties shrug on effortlessly over winter woollies and there'd be no trouble doing the buttons up after Christmas dinner. What's more, they keep you lovely and warm. At last, you might think, a fashion trend that works with, rather than against, the needs of real women. But slip them on, and their one disadvantage quickly becomes apparent: they really can make you look enormous.

So how does a normal, size 12 woman solve this dilemma? LYDIA SLATER tried on seven of this season's must-have coats over the same little black dress to find out which winter coats slim you - and which pile on the pounds...

Maroon mohair coat,  £200, topshop.comAn expensive coat which is properly lined, this feels luxurious, and I like the rich colour. In every other respect, it is hideous. The dropped sleeve makes my arms look short and fat, and gives me the shoulders of an American footballer. The cocoon shape curves out over my waist and stomach, and the fuzziness of the mohair fabric adds even more unwanted inches all over. Dress sizes gained: 4Verdict: I have the figure of a portly orangutan. 0/5

Military coat, £279, HobbsThis coat is cleverly structured to make the most of feminine curves. The waist is nipped in by three rows of buttons, and the skirt flares out to skim gently over the hips, falling to just below the knee. The epaulettes add extra definition to the shoulder, giving an hourglass shape. It does nip around the arms a bit, but could slip over a bulky jumper fairly easily. I feel like a heroine in a black-and-white film. Dress sizes gained: 0Verdict: I feel so trim, and like it so much I've bought it myself for Christmas. 5/5

KIMONO COAT - LOOKS LIKE A DRESSING GOWN

OVERCOAT - SWAMPED BY SWATHES OF PINK

Powder blue Danielle cape, £195, Coast This elegant cape feels glamorous and expensive, and hurray, it has a tie waist, so it's bound to be more flattering. Or so I thought before I put it on. But the bunched up, draped material doesn't flatter, the hem looks fussy and the abbreviated sleeves make my arms look short. This would make a lovely dressing gown, but it doesn't make me look remotely good enough to consider wearing outdoors. Dress sizes gained: 2Verdict: Surprisingly disappointing. 2/5

Pink coat, £85, M&SSupposed to be one of the season's must-haves, but I’m disappointed. The wide rolled-up cuffs and dropped shoulder shorten my arms from both ends. I don't like the big, clumsy popper fastenings, but if I wear it done up, the straight shape is swamping. There's not a hint of waist in it. No wonder the model in the advert wears it casually slung over her shoulders to avoid the problem.Dress sizes gained: 1 Verdict: Don't believe the hype. 3/5

COCOON COAT - DO I LOOK LIKE JACKIE O? NO!

Cocoon coat, £450, JaegerThis has a soft, metallic shimmer and a loose, elegant shape with flared sleeves. I hope the effect will be rather Jackie O, but I look like I'm wearing overalls. It feels huge and I look as though I’ve put on at least a stone. It's made worse by the unnecessary patch pockets which add bulk and fussiness to the front. A useful party standby if worn open over a tight little dress, but at this price it ought to work harder than that. Dress sizes gained: 3Verdict: Lovely on the hanger, not so great on the body. 2/5

Light grey Daisey coat, £279, HobbsA
 boyfriend coat that looks elegant and understated on the hanger, but it
 swamps me the moment I put it on. There’s acres of spare material under
 the arms. The deep V-neck does show off some skin, but the on-the-knee 
length means the coat isn’t very versatile — I can’t see it working well
 with trousers. It’s relatively wearable, but it makes me look very 
broad. Dress sizes gained: 2Verdict: A nice coat, but there’s too much bulk for my liking. 2/5

OPTICAL ILLUSION - I INSTANTLY FEEL INCHES SLIMMER

'Mallow' coat, £229, Damselinadress.co.ukThe
 optical illusion dress has become a red carpet regular for A-listers; 
now here's the equally clever coat version. Black panels on the 
shoulders and down the sides slim the waist and hips and make the wearer
 seem inches narrower than they are. The cut is similarly flattering, 
but I fear  the shape would be spoiled over anything more bulky than a 
formal dress. Dress sizes gained: 0. Verdict: Elegant but not very warm. 3/5
