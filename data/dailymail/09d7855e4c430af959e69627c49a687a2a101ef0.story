Manchester United comfortably saw off the challenge of Newcastle on Boxing Day, winning 3-1 as Wayne Rooney impressed.

The club captain operated in a deeper midfield role and netted twice, while Robin van Persie also got on the scoresheet before Papiss Cisse's late consolation. 

Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein rated the players at Old Trafford.

Manchester United beat Newcastle 3-0 on Boxing Day with Wayne Rooney netting twice at Old Trafford

David de Gea:  – Has enjoyed an inspired season and smartly dived to his left to tip away a powerful drive from Janmaat when the score was 0-0. Only beaten by Cisse's late penalty - 6.5

Phil Jones: – Showed why Van Gaal put him straight back in the team after injury. Commanding in the air, does the job Kompany and Terry do for Man City and Chelsea even though he was foolish to concede a late penalty - 7

Paddy McNair: – Part of his rehabilitation after being substituted early at Southampton. Had relatively little to do but fortunate to escape booking with rash challenge - 6

Jonny Evans: – Scored for both sides in the corresponding fixture on Boxing Day two years ago. Much quieter this time as part of a three-man defence - 6

Phil Jones showed Louis van Gaal exactly why he put him straight back into the starting line-up

Antonio Valencia: – Didn't maraud forward as much as usual, possibly to protect McNair and Jones, but did his job and was taken off early to get rest ahead of Sunday's trip to Spurs - 6

Michael Carrick: - Appreciated by van Gaal. Might not quite be United's best player as claimed by Sir Alex Ferguson, but very, very good - 6.5

Wayne Rooney: – The modern-day Martin Peters. Able to time his breaks from midfield into the penalty area perfectly, as underlined perfectly with his two first half goals. Always seems to score against Newcastle, and also set up No3 for van Persie with a pinpoint diagonal cross - 8

Rooney strokes home the opener after Radamel Falcao's fine work for the assist

Ashley Young:  – Playing his best football for United under van Gaal. Great delivery led to a glorious chance for Falcao, and stayed away from any diving controversy - 6.5

Juan Mata:  – Nearly gave away an early penalty when he clipped Gouffran but made amends with two glorious passes for Rooney's first half goals, one with his left, one with his right-foot. A natural No 10 - 7.5

Robin van Persie: – Unselfish performance from the Dutchman. Although the designated centre-forward, he peeled wide at times to give Rooney space to run in from deep. But he was in the No9 position to head his deserved goal. Booked for lunge at Janmaat - 7

Radamel Falcao: – Not quite 100 per cent sharp but beginning to show why he's considered world-class. Should have scored early on but stretched brillinatly to set up Rooney for his opening goal - 7

Robin van Persie heads home United's third of the afternoon past Jack Alnwick

Substitutions: Darren Fletcher (for Carrick 62 5.5) - The game was already won when he came on and he looked a bit rusty 

James Wilson (for Falcao 65 6) – Popular figure at OT having come through the ranks 

Rafael (for Valencia 80) 

Louis van Gaal:  – This was the day van Gaal's attacking philosophy came into play. Still has work to do at the back though - 7.5

NEWCASTLE UNITED (5-3-2)

Jak Alnwick:  – Impossible to miss in bright orange but his defenders would have preferred him to try and catch set-pieces rather than opting to punch even the easier ones. No clangers with the goals though - 5.5

Daryl Janmaat:  – Like Gouffran, he was a positive wing-back and tested de Gea with a thumping right-foot shot after 19 minutes - 6.5

Paul Dummett: – Difficult job in a rejigged Newcastle defence as manager Alan Pardew isn't normally a 3-5-2 man - 6

Fabricio Coloccini:  – Newcastle's captain but didn't really organise the back-five as a leader should, although in mitigation Manchester United's movement was very good - 5.5

Steven Taylor:  – His career hasn't really lived up to its early promise. A booking for a late and clumsy foul on Mata summed up his afternoon - 5.5

Steven Taylor struggled at Old Trafford - his career hasn't lived up to its early promise

Yoan Gouffran: – Got forward well from left wing-back and one foray led to a strong penalty appeal when he ran across Mata and there was clear contact between the pair - 7

Vernon Anita: – One of only two survivors in the Newcastle team from the side that lost 4-3 at Old Trafford on Boxing Day two years ago. Didn't make an impact here - 6

Moussa Sissoko: – Is the target for clubs in January but his agent won't be sending out any video footage of his performance here - 6

Jack Colback: – Thankless task trying to get the ball off Manchester United. Credit that he kept going and won a late consolation penalty - 6

Adam Armstrong:  – Tough for a 17-year-old striker to appear at Old Trafford on his Premier League debut and to be honest it was a little bit early for him, but that's not a surprise - 5.5

Ayoze Perez: – He is a decent goalscorer but when he's not scoring, contributes little to the cause. One dribble in the first half was his most impressive turn - 5.5

Ayoze Perez offers little going forward when he's not scoring for Newcastle

Substitutions: Remy Cabella (for Dummett 63) – Newcastle looked slightly more solid when he came on - 6

Papiss Cisse (for Armstrong 63) – A mystery why he didn't start ahead of Armstrong. Cooly scored a penalty and will surely start against Everton on Sunday - 6 

Haris Vuckic (for Perez 82) 

Alan Pardew Opted for an unfamiliar 5-3-2. The wing-backs actually did well but there was a gap in class in most other areas of the pitch - 6.5
