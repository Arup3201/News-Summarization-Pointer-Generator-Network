A mother hoping to find her teenage son safe and sound on Halloween night used an iPhone app to find he was both, though sadly it was under the care of the local police. 

The unidentified mother was reunited with the boy, 16, at the 103rd Precinct station house in Jamaica, Queens, where authorities were questioning him in connection to a string of robberies. 

He and two Hispanic teens were suspected of four robberies over the last month in an area blocked off by Hillside and Jamaica avenues as well as 175th and 185th streets.

The unidentified mother was reunited with the boy, 16, at the 103rd Precinct station house in Jamaica, Queens, where authorities were questioning him in connection to a string of robberies.

The unidentified teen is suspected of hitting victims on the head from beyond then making off with wallets and cellphones. 

Two of the robberies were just hours apart that Halloween night. 

The boy was caught with a girl, 15, by officers monitoring the area while one other suspect is still being sought. 

Both teens now face robbery charges.   

The boy's mother reportedly tried to call him for two hours before using the phone to find him

'She literally came into the precinct because she tracked his phone into the precinct and asked: 'Is my son here?'  Deputy Inspector John Cappelmann, commanding officer of the 103rd Precinct, told DNA Info. 

She reportedly tried to call him for two hours before using the phone to find him. 

The boy reportedly told police: 'I should have listened to her and I should have gone home.'

He has two prior arrests both in that month for robbery and assault.
