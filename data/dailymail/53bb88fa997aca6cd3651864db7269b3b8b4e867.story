The latest in a string of delays and alterations to the Affordable Care Act – nearly 30 in all –has the federal government deciding to delay penalizing about 500,000 Americans who have what President Obama recently called 'substandard' and 'junk' health insurance plans.

Penalties scheduled to hit as many as 1.5 million such Americans who have not yet seen cancellation notices from their insurers were set to kick in just before the November 2014 congressional election.

But now that deadline has been pushed back until five weeks before the 2016 presidential contest, creating a potential headache for Hillary Rodham Clinton – Obama's former secretary of state and his party's presumptive nominee to succeed him.

Republicans immediately mocked the move as cynically political and designed to protect vulnerable liberals in Congress, noting Obama's quest to avoid a Republican-majority U.S. Senate when the dust settles eight months from now.

If you like your plan, you can keep it -- until I'm nearly retired -- Obama seems to be saying, in a mvoe that Republicans are blasting as nakedly political

Ballgame: All eyes are on the U.S. Senate elections in November, after which Mitch McConnell (C) could become the new majority leader -- and the unpopular Obamacare law could propel Republicans to victory

Democrats fear that Americans frustrated with an Obamacare system that defied the president's many campaign promises, particularly his oft-stated pledge to protect those who wanted to keep their medical insurance plans and their doctors, will take it out on liberal legislators who voted for the law nearly more than four years ago.

But the most the White House can do is delay the onset of chronic health insurance pain, not prevent it: Clinton or another Democrat will have to carry the Affordable Care Act's baggage into the 2016 election.

Republican leaders met the announcement of the latest gear-shifting in Obamacare's implementation on Wednesday with rhetorical catcalls and we-told-you-sos.

'This move is a cynical ploy that delays thousands of insurance policy cancellations until after the elections,' said Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, 'in the hopes that Americans won’t notice the spiking premiums and shrinking options they face under the president’s health care law.'

'Nothing, however,' Issa warned, 'can distract from the fact that the president blatantly broke his promise that "if you like your plan you can keep your plan."'

House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia said in a statement that Democrats' worst fear is 'full implementation' of the Affordable Care Act.

'Time and again, the Obama Administration has shown its true colors by putting politics first and unilaterally delaying parts of the law to avoid political repercussions,' he sniped.

'Doesn't it say something that the authors of this legislation are worried that it's implemented before they face voters again?'

Will she? Won't she? (Will she still want to?) Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, will have to carry Obamacare's baggage into a presidential contest if she runs

Health insurance policies that White House Press Secretary Jay Carney derided just months ago as 'substandard' will be acceptable until just before the 2016 presidential election

The net effect of Wednesday's announcement is that many Americans will be permitted to keep health insurance policies which, for a variety of reasons, don't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards.

A senior White House staffer told CNBC that the number could reach 1.5 million

President Obama railed against those options throughout 2013, and administration figures have called them 'substandard' and 'junk insurance.'

Explainer: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the latest sudden Obamacare policy shift represented a way for the government to ease the pain of transition

Those policyholders will be permitted to renew their plans through October 1, 2016, pushing their coverage well into 2017.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement that her agency's shifting policy would 'implement the health care law in a common-sense way by continuing to smooth the transition for consumers and stakeholders and fixing problems wherever the law provides flexibility.'

'This comprehensive guidance will help ensure that consumers, employers and insurers have the information they need to plan for next year,' she added, 'and make it easier for families to make decisions to access quality, affordable coverage.'

The nuts and bolts of the regulatory walk-back are complicated. President Obama declared late in 2013 that Americans who wanted to keep their plans could do so, and Wednesday's move is an extension of that one.

But by the time the president changed course last year, at least 5 million taxpayers had already received cancellation letters from insurance companies whose offerings didn't meet with Obamacare's strict minimum requirements.

Not everyone can benefit from the White House's suddenly relaxed posture toward what will qualify as a 'compliant' insurance policy.

State insurance commissioners, not the president, decide whether to allow insurers to continue offering plans from one year to the next. And the insurance companies are under no obligation to sell those plans in 2014.

But to conservatives who smell the latest drops of blood in the water, the White House appears mired in a posture dedicated more to winning elections than to seeing Obamacare through.

The move 'reeks of politics,' a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declared it a 'desperate move to protect vulnerable Democrats in national elections later this year.'

McConnell will likely become the Senate majority leader if Republicans gain six seats in November – and he survives his own tough election challenge from Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.

On the other side of the U.S. Capitol, House Republicans, still angry that the Obamacare law's 'individual mandate' tax remains in effect for the 2014 tax year, staged a protest vote on Wednesday.

Twenty-seven Democrats joined them, passing a bill by a 250-160 margin that would delay those penalties for individual taxpayers.

The measure faces certain death in the Democrat-controlled Senate.
