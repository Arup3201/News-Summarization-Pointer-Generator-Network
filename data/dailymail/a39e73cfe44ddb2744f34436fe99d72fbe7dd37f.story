With fillet steak from Somerset, scallops from Devon and cheese from the West Country and Hampshire, First Great Western's Pullman dining is featuring more food 'local' to its route than ever.

Britain's only daily fine-dining service on the rails has launched a new menu designed by celebrity chef Mitch Tonks that includes 50 dishes made from ingredients found within 15 miles its routes.

Restaurateur Tonks' menu, to be prepared fresh on board by the train's resident chefs, also includes fish from his own local Brixham market in Devon and quince jelly from Somerset.

Tonks, speaking with an on-board chef, has designed a new menu with items local to the train's routes

It also sources burrata (a fresh cheese made with mozarella and cream) from Laverstoke Farms in Hampshire which passengers can see when travelling from London to Plymouth.

'The south west is home to some of the best food in the world and with the new Pullman menu, passengers can enjoy top-class meals on the railway,' said Tonks, who was voted Tatler's restaurateur of the year. 

'I've selected a variety of fresh seafood, meats, vegetables and wine which are favourites in my own restaurants.' 

While not all the wines are British, they are a selection from Tonks' award-winning The Seahorse restaurant in Dartmouth and include Knightor Trevannion, an aromatic white from near the Eden Project in Cornwall.

Tonks' menu honours their 50:15 pledge, with 50 items from within 15 miles of the track the trains travel on

In total, First Great Western is sourcing 90 items from local suppliers.

The company's head of customer engagement, Jo Elliott, said: 'We are both committed to supporting the communities we serve, and what better way to enjoy the view from the train than to eat expertly prepared food, produced from the very landscape you travel through.'

Two additional services launching in March from London Paddington to Plymouth will take the Pullman to a total 12 daily services including routes to Penzance, Plymouth, Bristol Parkway, Cardiff and Swansea.
