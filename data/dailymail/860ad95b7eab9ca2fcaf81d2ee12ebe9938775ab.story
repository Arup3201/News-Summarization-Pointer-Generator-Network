Former Reading striker Jason Roberts believes promising coaches and managers are being lost to the game simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.

Only 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches, a new report has revealed.

The figures show that only 3.4 per cent of the coaches employed come from BME backgrounds despite making up 25 per cent of professional players.

Jason Roberts arrives for a meeting to discuss racism in football at 10 Downing Street in February 2012 

The report was carried out by the Sports Person's Think Tank, which has called for English football to set an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches to be from BME backgrounds by 2020.

Roberts, who is one of the founding members of the think tank, says in the report: 'It appears that football has lost successive generations of potential coaches and managers simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.

'The numbers do not add up, so many players from our communities who have achieved so much on the field of play - distinguished careers as senior players in some of the biggest clubs in this country, many with international caps, some who played at major tournaments - yet so few that have been given opportunities to achieve as coaches.

Roberts scores for Reading against Southampton during his side's  npower Championship match in April 2012 

'Talk to these individuals about the realities they faced, the number of jobs they applied for, the number of interviews they had, and the feeling emerges that they have been the victims of a systematic denial of talent and ambition."

The report highlights that low numbers of coaches from BME backgrounds complete UEFA coaching qualifications, with potential coaches deterred from going into management due to the perceived lack of opportunity.

The report, funded by the European anti-discrimination body FARE, also states English football often operates 'insider' networks to recruit coaches based on personal connections rather than qualifications.
