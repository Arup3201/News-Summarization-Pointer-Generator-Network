Rangers legends  joined forces to hit back at a cheeky stunt by Celtic supporters – kicking off Old Firm week with an old-fashioned war of words.

A group of Celtic fans took out an advert in a Scottish Sunday newspaper paper branding Rangers a ‘new club which came into being in 2012’, declaring that this weekend’s League Cup semi-final will be the first meeting between the clubs – and hitting out at the ‘continuation fiction’ surrounding the Ibrox side.

A number of the former Rangers greats at Ibrox for yesterday’s Fernando Ricksen Tribute Match took exception to this interpretation of history, Dutch great Ronald de Boer saying: ‘They are fans and I think only one per cent of people think that way. I think most people think differently - and they will be looking forward to this game.

‘Of course, people in Holland think of Rangers as the same club. They just think it is sad when they hear of it going into the Third Division. It is sad what happened because we have a lot of Dutch history in the club and they hope it is back soon.

‘I have always known that there is a giant out there in Rangers that is waiting to burst out. There will be good times again, for sure.’

Former manager Alex McLeish went further, insisting: ‘For me Celtic are missing Rangers. You see empty spaces at Celtic Park. Back in the day when Martin O’Neill was there and they had a superb team, we did too. Stadiums were full every week.

‘So Celtic are missing Rangers. A lot of people will probably be trolling me for that but I think a lot of people will agree.’

Ex-midfielder Alex Rae said of the advert: ‘Listen, that’s just provoking things. If that’s what they get their kicks from on the day, maybe it will take away from their performance!

‘Seriously, good luck to them, they can conduct themselves like that if they want.

‘Rangers, over the years, have tried to conduct themselves in the right manner, with a bit of dignity.

‘So it’s not important what they do. What is important is how we conduct ourselves.’

And former defender Bert Konterman said: ‘I have seen the same in Holland at PEC Zwolle, the team I joined as a young lad.

‘When I came in, it was PEC Zwolle, it was FC Zwolle when I played there and the name went back to PEC. The shirt changed a little bit as well, but, overall, it is the same club. It is the same stadium, it is the same history.

‘You can never erase that. No chance. Of course, I feel the same way about Rangers. It is a nice try, but no chance. It is in the heart of the people and that won’t change.

‘I think it is a bit of sarcasm. It is funny from their side.’

Over 41,000 turned out for yesterday’s benefit match for a visibly ailing Ricksen, McLeish saying: ‘It was great walking out and seeing another powerful moment involving Rangers fans.

‘The noise they could make inside this stadium when it’s full. It’s so difficult to get it through your head Rangers aren’t doing well when you see that support.

‘It’s a brilliant tribute to Fernando, these guys turning out like this a- nd I’ve got to compliment the players turning out for helping a friend who’s having a bad time.

‘He was emotional in the dressing room. He was trying to get things across to you and he was frustrated by that. You could see that.

‘But the boys are very supporting of him and we just want to make everything as comfortable as possible for him. Raising the funds from this game hopefully that can help him.’

De Boer added: ‘Fernando was so full of spirit and a great fighter as a player and it is very sad when you see him. He is getting worse and worse, but the turnout was incredible and it was great to be back at the club.’

And Konterman said: ‘I last saw Fernando about a year ago before Christmas and he could move and speak much better than now. I was really shocked when I saw him because his hands were cramped, he was struggling with his balance and I can hardly understand him any more.

‘He is going backwards, but what the supporters did for him was unbelievable. They came here to support him and enjoy the old glories. They want to get that back, but that is a different story.’
