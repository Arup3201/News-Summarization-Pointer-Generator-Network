Infected: Simon McClure was a frequent visitor to Switzerland and Thailand where he used prostitutes

An HIV sufferer who passed on the potentially deadly virus to his lover may have infected hundreds of other women, it was claimed today.

Simon McClure ignored ‘clear advice’ from doctors when he was diagnosed in 2006 not to have unprotected sex.

The 38-year-old from Middlesbrough later boasted of sleeping with hundreds of women and had only recently returned from honeymoon in Cuba. 

While McClure now sits behind bars, detectives issued an urgent appeal to identify any other women he may have infected. 

His one known victim told of her harrowing ordeal today and said McClure – who was jailed for two years and six months – had destroyed her.

She said she had to endure a life sentence while he would be free by the Christmas after next, having served just half of his jail term. 

‘I despise him,’ said the mother of three.

‘I’m now aware that he boasted about sleeping with hundreds of women. Nor did I have any idea he was HIV positive.’

She only discovered that she was carrying the virus after a routine check when she was 28 weeks’ pregnant with McClure’s daughter in 2008.

The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, went into premature labour the next day and gave birth.

Her child, who is now two, is not carrying the virus.

McClure pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm at Teesside Crown Court.

The 38-year-old HIV carrier was a frequent visitor to Switzerland and Thailand, where he used prostitutes, and had boasted about sleeping with 'hundreds' of women.

Prison: McClure was jailed for two years and eight months at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) after he admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim

He was diagnosed after returning from
 South East Asia in 2006 but did not tell people he had unprotected sex 
with, Alexander Menary, prosecuting, told the court.

His victim's brother and aunt revealed how she is struggling 
to come to terms with how her life has changed.

The family said they 
were disappointed with the sentence of two years and eight months.

Her 
brother said: 'You get more than that for burglary.'

Her aunt said: 'We 
don't think it is long enough. She has to live with this every day. She 
has got a life sentence. He will be out before Christmas next year.'

His lawyer, Graham Brown, told Judge 
Howard Crowson said: 'He hasn't done 
what was right and proper.'

In a victim impact statement, the victim told how she is worried about passing on the virus, and 
said: 'My life will never be normal again.'

She revealed she was 
rejected by a dentist and doctor, and has to ensure nobody touches her 
toothbrush and that cuts are carefully managed.

McLure was told by Judge Crowson that his 
risk-taking was premeditated.

The judge added: 'I am sure you knew - 
everybody is aware - of the risks involved in having unprotected sex 
carrying HIV.

'Any form of intimate sexual relationship has a degree of 
mutual trust and you breached it by what you did.

'The effect on her has
 been devastating. She endured the fear, having given birth prematurely,
 that the child may also carry the virus... the happy news has been 
given that it does not.

'She will have to live with what is, 
unfortunately, still in this country, a stigma which attaches itself to 
people who carry this virus, even though she is not at fault for it.'

Outside the hearing, Detective Inspector Andy Greenwood, of Cleveland Police, said: 'If anybody has any information in relation to McClure they should come forward.

'The possibility exists that he has had relationships with other people that we are not aware of and we would urge them to contact us immediately.

'He has now been sentenced to an appropriate period of custody, so they can come forward now and tell us about it and we can take the appropriate action.'

Mr Greenwood added: 'The victim will suffer for the rest of her life through the reckless and callous behaviour of this individual.

'She is unable to have a normal life and carry out day-to-day activities through no fault of her own.'
