Gerard Depardieu has thrown a barbecue for 200 of his neighbours after being made an honorary citizen of the Belgian town he moved to in order to escape high tax rates in France.

The actor caused controversy last year when he announced he was leaving France to avoid a threatened 75 per cent rate of tax on annual incomes over one million euros (£860,000).

After yesterday's ceremony in Nechin, Belgium, Depardieu told reporters that he considered himself a 'citizen of the world.'

His comments follow an interview with French magazine Le Figaro that the controversy surrounding his self-imposed exile from France was a 'big misunderstanding.' 

Depardieu, 64, told the magazine: ''I never left! I refuse to be shut in by borders, that's completely different.

'I am a free man. I feel at home everywhere in Europe.

'This whole story is a big misunderstanding. I love France as much as ever. It's my country.'

Yesterday, the actor cooked suckling pig and steaks for his neighbours in Nechin, just one kilometre from the border with France.

The ceremony was held at the Chateau Bourgogne where he was made an honorary citizen of Estaimpuis municipality, which includes the village.

The actor, who famously starred in 
Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac, moved to the tax haven last year and 
bought a 19th century five-bedroom villa.

Town mayor Daniel Senesael said Depardieu had always planned to 'do something nice with the neighbours'.

He told the BBC: 'He kept his word. He bought his house, the neighbours were invited... and so I think it's great when you keep your promises.'

Depardieu, who has made more than 150 films, wrote an open letter to France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault last year explaining why he was leaving his native country.

He wrote: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’

He said he paid 85 per cent of his income to the Government last year, and estimated that he had paid more than £130 million in total since he started work on leaving school aged 14.

In January this year Mr Depardieu courted more controversy by accepting a Russian passport from President Vladimir Putin.

He was fined earlier this year after falling off his scooter while driving drunk in Paris.
