Dog owners have been warned that their animals could be at risk from a popular brand of pet food which is at the centre of a multi-million-pound lawsuit.

Purina Beneful is accused of making dogs violently ill, causing seizures, kidney failure, sudden weight loss and even death.

Distraught pet owners across North America are now suing Nestle, the brand’s owner, for $5million (£3.3million) over the allegedly unsafe dry dog food - which can also be bought in the UK.

Companion: Loss: Jean-Francois Menicucci from Montreal told MailOnline his 240lb mastiff Rex ate Purina Beneful after a family member brought it back from the store one day. He believes it led to his beloved dog's premature death

Terrifying ordeal: Rex devoured the product in August 2013 and then suddenly started having a seizure

The company strongly denies the allegations, calling the lawsuit ‘baseless’, although thousands of dog owners have complained about the effect of the food on their pets.

They claim the dry food product contains toxic chemicals including propylene glycol, which can be used as an anti-freeze, and mycotoxin.

All of the customers involved in the class-action lawsuit, which was filed last month in California, are from the US or Canada.

However, Beneful is also available in Britain - four varieties of the brand’s dry food are listed for sale on Amazon.co.uk, and it can also be bought from other leading pet food retailers online.

Pet owners who are worried about their animals becoming ill as a result of their diet should consult a vet in order to determine whether there is any risk. 

Seizure: Mr Menicucci describes how Rex was fitting for hours and couldn't even move him to get him to the vet. Before they could get him help he was gone 

Heartbreaking: Mr Menicucci said Rex just stopped breathing and keeled over in front of him 

A number of dog owners in the US and Canada who believe their animals have suffered as a result of Purina Beneful have shared their experiences with MailOnline.

Jean-Francois Menicucci, from Montreal in Canada, said his 240lb mastiff Rex ate Beneful after a family member brought it back from the store in April 2013.

‘My other dog, Tally, refused to eat it,’ he said. ‘But Rex devoured it.’

He described how 40 minutes later Rex, who was three years old at the time, went into a seizure for hours without stopping. He could not move him to take him to the vet.

‘Suddenly he died in front of my eyes. He stopped breathing and he was gone.’

He filed a complaint to the authorities, suggesting his dog’s death was caused by Beneful. Officials then came and collected samples of the food. Purina subsequently sent him an apology and 24 Canadian Dollars (£13).

‘At the time, my mother came out from a seven-month coma in the ICU,’ he added. ‘She woke up with her two legs partially paralyzed, she was working very hard to regain mobility, because her dream was to walk Rex again. Imagine when I told her he had died. I just want justice for Rex.’ 

Concern: Mike Garnett-Zero posted a horrifying video of friend Cassandra Angelique comforting a dog who they said had been given Purina Beneful

Horrifying: Michael Dowling described how his niece's English Bulldog called Pippa (pictured) had to be 'put to sleep' after suffering from kidney failure. Their vet said it was down to the dog being fed Purina Beneful 

Propylene glycol is regularly used as a flavouring ingredient in drinks and food as E-1520.

It is found in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, but regulations of its use differ between the US and the EU.

In October, for example, Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey was pulled from the shelves across Europe because it contained the substance, as it was in breach of European regulations. However it remained on the shelves in the US. 

In the US, the chemical is 'generally recognised as safe' by the Food and Drug Administration, and Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey claims up to 50 grams per kilogram can be used, though it states it uses far less in its drink.

Popylene glycol is also found in automotive and aircraft anti-freeze, for its ability to lower the freezing point of water.

The substance is also released alongside nicotine when smoking e-cigarettes.  

Denial: The company say the lawsuit is 'baseless' 

Another dog owner, Mike Garnett-Zero, uploaded a horrifying video of friend Cassandra Angelique comforting their dog Melody, who they said had just eaten Purina Beneful.

It shows the animal lying on the floor of its cage unable to get up.

Underneath the video posted on Facebook, he wrote: ‘Beneful’s line of pet food and treats has poisoned our beautiful pets for the last time. Please boycott this brand and never feed it to your loved ones.’

They also posted another showing Melody barely able to stand and losing balance as she walks, so Mr Garnett-Zero has to hold her on his lap.

In February, Michael Dowling told his followers on GooglePlus what had happened to his niece’s English Bulldog called Pippa.

Next to a picture of the pet wearing a pink top hat, he described how his niece had to ‘put their dog to sleep’ due to kidney failure.

Dowling says that the dog’s deteriorating health may have been prompted by eating the product.

Cheryl Harmon wrote on Facebook how her Chihuahua, called Darcie, died at the age of six as a result of what she believes was poisoning from the product.

Julie Hyde, 39, of Sandwich, Illinois, said her six-year-old pitbull called Bossy was as ‘healthy as a horse’ before she started eating the food.

However she believes it was extremely detrimental to her health thereafter.

‘You could see her spine and ribs’, she said. ‘For her to lose that much weight dramatically there was something definitely wrong.’

After taking her to a vet, the animal was diagnosed with diabetes because her sugar levels were ‘sky-high’.

Despite treatment, Bossy’s health continued to deteriorate and she had to be put down last December.

The company has vehemently denied the allegations and insists customers should continue buying the product.

A spokesman for Nestlé Purina PetCare said: ‘We are aware that a class action lawsuit was recently filed against Beneful in the United States.

‘We believe this lawsuit to be baseless and intend to vigorously defend our high quality, nutritious food which is backed by Purina’s strict quality controls and comprehensive food safety programme. Purina dog foods are enjoyed by millions of dogs every day and pet owners can continue to feed them with total confidence.’ 

Another alleged vicitim: Morgan Malone, 19, of North Carolina, told NBC News her dachshund called Doc got 'super sick' and died within the space of a week after eating the product

Memory: She posted pictures of her beloved dog on Facebook with friends offering her messages of support

Pet owner Frank Lucido filed the lawsuit on February 5 in US District Court in the Northern District of California against Nestle Purina PetCare Company.

Lucido claims he fed his three dogs Beneful ‘kibble’ style dog food, and within a short period of time, two were sick and one was dead.

The suit alleges the food contains propylene glycol, which it says is an animal toxin used in automobile antifreeze, and mycotoxins, a group of toxins produced by fungus that occurs in grains.

In the suit, Mr Lucido alleges that in the past four years, there have been more than 3,000 complaints online about dogs becoming ill or dying after eating Beneful, having shown ‘consistent symptoms,’ including stomach and related internal bleeding, liver malfunction or failure, vomiting, diarrhea, have not yet been released.

The suit asks the court to expand the case to include other dog owners whose dogs were sickened or died. It asks for unspecified damages and restitution, although it says the claims exceed $5million.

In recent years, Beneful has faced two lawsuits that were dismissed by the courts, according to Purina’s statement.

However, in a lawsuit settled in May, Purina and Waggin’ Train LLC agreed to create a $6.5 million fund to compensate pet owners who claimed their pets were sickened after eating China-made jerky treats.

At the time, US officials said the pet treats were linked to more than 1,000 deaths in dogs and more than 4,800 complaints of animal illness.
