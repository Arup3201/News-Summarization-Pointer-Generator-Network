Most of the UK will be hit by severe weather on Monday with 60-70mph winds

The worst storms for 15 years are on the way as the tail end of a hurricane hits our shores this weekend.

Gales of up to 80mph will set in tomorrow night, prompting warnings of damage to buildings, falling trees, flooding and transport chaos.

The Met Office issued a rare near-nationwide weather alert for Monday and said there were no areas that could be ruled out.

The warning comes as the remains of Hurricane Katia, which whipped up 22ft waves off the U.S. east coast, move across the Atlantic today.

By the time Katia reaches the UK, the winds will be just below tropical storm force – the same level as those that hit New York last month.

After a cloudy day today and tomorrow, stormy winds will hit the South West, Midlands, North of England and Scotland tomorrow evening.

A yellow alert – which warns people to be on their guard – has been issued for all of the country except the South East, but this could be upgraded to the more serious amber level today as the storm closes in.

Flooding is possible along the western coasts of England and Scotland, although no specific local flood alerts have yet been issued.

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said it could be the strongest storm since 1996, when winds of 90mph caused huge disruption after the remains of Hurricane Lili reached Britain from the U.S.

She said: ‘We are urging people to keep checking for updates on the weather warnings.

‘All areas could potentially see the impacts of Katia with wind gusts of 60-70mph across England and up to 80mph in Scotland.’

While it is not unusual for the 
remains of hurricanes to hit Britain, the effects of Katia will be 
stronger than usual because it has crossed the Atlantic so quickly.

England and Wales will see less windy weather on Tuesday before it clears on Wednesday.

The Environment Agency is advising residents in coastal areas to sign up for flood alerts on its website.
