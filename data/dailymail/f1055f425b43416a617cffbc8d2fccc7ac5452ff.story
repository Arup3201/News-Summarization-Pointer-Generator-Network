Born three and a half months premature, baby Ward Miles did not have the easiest start in life but thanks to the love of his parents and endless dedication of doctors and nurses, the 
little fighter pulled through.

His father, Benjamin Miller who is a photographer that works under the name Benjamin 
Scot, captured his son's first year in a moving short film, beginning with those difficult, early days in the NICU and following Ward as he goes from strength to strength at home.

The video begins with new mom Lyndsey gingerly picking up her son, who weighs under 1.5lbs, four days after he was born 15 weeks early at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

Little Ward Miles spent the first 107 days of his life in the NICU with a host of machines to help him survive

With the help of the nurses moving wires and medical equipment, Lyndsey eases into a chair and holds her tiny son to her chest.

She smiles for the camera and then the new mother becomes overwhelmed by the moment and bursts into tears.

The moving scene is just one of many in the couple's emotional roller coaster following the birth of  their premature son on July 16, 2012.

It has been captured beautifully in the seven-minute Vimeo film which Mr Miller dedicated to his wife and to the doctors and nurses who were constantly by their side.

Mr and Mrs Miller, both from central Ohio, have been married for four years and live in Columbus.

Their first child Ward was born 15 weeks early at Riverside Methodist Hospital, weighing 
just 1lb 13oz.

He was transferred four days after he was born to 
Nationwide Children's Hospital to undergo a procedure and remained in the hospital's NICU fighting for his life for the next 107 days.

'There were two very scary moments that stand out among the rest,' Mr Miller said.

'The
 first was when they did his first brain scan looking for bleeding. 
There are 4 grades, 1-4 with 4 being the worst. The results came back and he had a grade 2 
on one side, and a grade 4 on the other.

'Lyndsey 
called me at work ( I had just gone back) and the second I picked up, I 
knew something was wrong. She told me what they found out and I 
immediately left to be with them.

Mr Miller said in the early days he and wife Lyndsey went through some dark moments when they feared their son would left severely handicapped from his premature birth

He continued: 'I cried and prayed the whole way down.
 The bleeds could lead to severe problems down the road. He may not be 
able to walk. He may have cerebral palsy. He may be mentally 
handicapped. The list goes on and on.

'When I got there we just embraced 
and cried together. He looked exactly the same. He had no idea that some
 test was done. He was still Ward.

'I felt so bad for him. It wasn't his 
fault. He couldn't do anything to fix it. We couldn't do anything to fix
 it. The doctors couldn't do anything to fix it. It was a horrible 
feeling. All we could do was pray.'

Mr Miller shared with MailOnline the thoughts that he put down in his journal, when during one of the new parents' darkest hours, their son offered them a glimmer of hope.

He wrote: 'At
 the 6 oclock care time, we were holding his hand, looking at him, 
talking to him. His CPAP mask was off, and his feeding tube was out as 
well.

'While we 
were watching him, he turned his little head towards us, and then opened
 his eyes.

We know he can't see at this stage, but the fact that he 
opened them, and opened them so wide we had not seen before. He stared 
right at us. He held our gaze. Just looked right at us. Didn't blink.

I 
had enough time to get a photo of it. After a little while he shut his 
little eyes and turned his head back to the ceiling. I will never forget
 that moment. I feel as if he was telling us 'I'm okay!!! Don't give up 
on me!'

The new father noted a few lines later: 'We won't.'

In the next few days, the parents were given the reassuring news that the bleeding had stopped.

Mr Miller's video soon changes from images of the NICU to capture his young son's developing personality (including some hilarious facial expressions)

Thankfully, the video soon takes a turn and there are fewer tubes and beeping monitors.

After his first 107 days of life in the hospital, Ward Miles finally went home on October 31, 2012.

His father said: 'It was such an amazing feeling to have him 
home, where he belonged. The dogs had no idea what to think. 107 days is
 almost 1/3rd of a year.

'Being able to come home from work and not have 
to drive down to the hospital to see our son was such a huge blessing. We certainly will never take that for granted.'

Although the little boy still has some feeding issues, Mr Miller said that doctors are in disbelief when they find out his healthy son was born 15 weeks premature.

So when it came to celebrating the special young man's first birthday, one cake just wasn't enough.

His father said: 'He sort of had four first birthday parties. Was bored with the cake by the 4th one!'

Mr
Miller said that the family could not have coped with their ordeal 
without the love and prayers from family and thousands of friends and 
supporters, some of whom they had never met.

He made the video to commemorate his son's first year and as a birthday present for his wife.

He added: 'I want to thank all the doctors, nurses, and staff all over the world
 that make it their life's mission to help babies get better!  It's 
because of you that my son ever stood a chance to make it home.'

Mr Miller shared the adorable video of the family's journey to inspire others and in tribute to the work of medical teams all over the world working to save premature babies
