Catalan Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous is confident he can get his side up one more time for a tilt at a maiden Grand Final.

The French club, who finished seventh in the Super League table, have pulled off shock away wins over Leeds and Huddersfield so far in the play-offs.

Catalan Dragons face St Helens for a place in the Super League Grand Final on Thursday evening

Catalans coach Laurent Frayssinous says his side must 'keep believing' they can reach the final

On Wednesday they were back in their private jet to fly over for Thursday’s semi-final against St Helens at Langtree Park.

Frayssinous said: ‘We have only trained once this week but we have just got to concentrate on taking it one step further. The main thing is to keep on believing.’

While the Dragons have been criss-crossing the Channel, Saints have enjoyed a week off, but coach Nathan Brown is not convinced that it will be an advantage.

‘Some like to play week in, week out and others like to have a rest,’ he said.

‘We will see on Thursday night which is the best way.'

The French side have already beaten both Leeds and Huddersfield away from home this campaign
