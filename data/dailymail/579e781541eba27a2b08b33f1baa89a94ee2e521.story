A man has told how a mugger attacked him from behind as he laid flowers on his parents' grave.

Terence Boyle, 68, was grabbed by the neck, punched and wrestled to the ground by a man who ambushed him as he visited his parents' grave on the anniversary of his mother's death.

The retired factory worker, from Gorton, Manchester, needed a CAT scan to check for bleeding on the brain after he was attacked at Gorton cemetery on Saturday lunchtime.

Terence Boyle, 68, was tending his parents' grave when he was attacked from behind by a mugger

Mr Boyle had been in the graveyard for an hour, tending the graves of his mother, Norah, and father, John, when he was attacked by a man who police believe had lain in wait for him.

He fought back, but the mugger punched him in the face twice before escaping with his wallet, which contained £140 cash.

Mr Boyle, who suffers from atrial fibrillation, which means he has an irregular heartbeat, called his brother for help on his mobile phone and was found leaning against a headstone suffering with severe shock and a cut to his mouth.

The bachelor, who visits his parents' graves regularly, escaped serious injury but was rushed to hospital for brain scan.

He said: 'I was tending to my parents' graves and was just about to leave when I felt a hand on my collar and a hand in my back pocket.

'I swung round and grabbed hold of the individual and there was a struggle and I fell to the ground.'

He said the 'scruffy looking' man punched him in the face twice, knocking off his glasses, before fleeing.

Mr Boyle said: 'My glasses had gone and I was dazed.  There was nothing I could do - I felt helpless.'

He added: 'My mum died of heart disease 19 years ago and I used to come here with my dad before he died and we used to sit on the bench and knock our thoughts about.

'On the day of the attack I went to reflect on our life together - now this day is just a bad memory.

'My mum would have been heartbroken'

Mr Boyle's mother died in May 1995 from heart disease at the age of 85, while his father, John, died in 2001, aged 89.

The mugger is described as white, of stocky build, and aged between 35 and 40. He was about 5ft 8in tall with short brown hair and was wearing blue stonewash jeans and a navy jumper.

Detective Constable Michael O’Connor of Greater Manchester Police said: 'To attack a man at a graveside is an appalling act of cowardice and the actions of the person responsible smack of absolute desperation.

'This man needs to be caught and brought to justice.'
