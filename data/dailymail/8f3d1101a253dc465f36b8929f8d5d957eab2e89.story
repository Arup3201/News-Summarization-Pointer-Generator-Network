Aaron Hernadez was photographed laughing and smiling today as his lawyer attempted to suppress major evidence in his murder trial. 

Hernadez's lawyers are trying to get evidence from the former football star's cell phone that shows he was in contact with the man he allegedly murdered, Odin Lloyd, in the days before he was shot in 2013, thrown out in court.

Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston, Massachusetts, had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée at the time of his death.

No laughing matter: Aaron Hernandez (above) was photographed laughing in court as his lawyers tried to suppress cell phone evidence being used in his murder trial

Not the first time: Hernandez also laughed and smirked when his trial date was being set back in June of this year

Hernandez, 24, did not address the court during the proceedings.

The prosecution told the judge the defense had agreed to turn over the phone shortly after Hernandez was convicted, arguing against their attempts to suppress this crucial evidence in their case. 

The defense, however, now maintains the phone was turned over under a 'false claim of legal authority' and is seeking to have evidence from it thrown out. 

In prior court filings, they have said the warrant did not authorize the phone's seizure from Hernandez's attorneys or from their law office and that the seizure was illegal. 

Prosecutors have alleged that Hernandez and Lloyd exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that Hernandez and two accomplices picked up Lloyd in Boston before driving him to North Attleborough and killing him. 

'They were clearly in communication with each other, setting up a meeting, as it appeared,' Bomberg said at the hearing.

Hernandez declined to allow authorities to search the phone at the police department a few hours after Lloyd's body was found, but his attorneys said he would maintain its contents and turn it over if a warrant was produced, Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg testified during the hearing in Bristol County Superior Court.

Bomberg said he learned that Hernandez no longer had the phone and that he had given it to his lawyers only when the prosecutor called to inform them that search warrants were being executed at the former Patriot's home.

The defense has said in court filings that authorities learned where the phone was after Hernandez told them during what they call an unlawful interrogation at his house.

The hearing is to continue Wednesday.

Hernandez also is charged in another case with the murder of two Boston men in 2012 after a brief encounter at a nightclub. He has pleaded not guilty in that case too.

This is not the first time Hernandez has been spotted laughing and smiling in court, as the former New England Patriot did the same when a date for his trial was set back in June.
