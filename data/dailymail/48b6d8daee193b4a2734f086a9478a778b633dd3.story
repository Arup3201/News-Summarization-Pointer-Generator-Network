These are the scenes of squalor which were discovered by police when they arrived at the home of two-year-old girl who died after accidentally drinking her drug addict mother's methadone out of a Tom and Jerry beaker.

Barry Jones, 42, and Michelle King, 30, were this week convicted of the killing of little Sophie Jones, who died after drinking from the cup she thought contained her favourite fruit shoot drink. 

When they arrived at the terraced family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, detectives found medication stacked next to children's toys  and filthy rooms littered with dirty washing and pushchairs.

These are the scenes which greeted police when they arrived at the home of two-year-old Sophie Jones, who died after accidentally drinking her drug addict mother's methadone out of a Tom and Jerry beaker

Sophie, aged two (pictured) drank from the beaker unaware it was her mother's powerful heroin substitute

The little girl drank from the beaker unaware it was the powerful heroin substitute which her mother Michelle King had been storing to sell on to fund her drug habit - in what police said was akin to 'leaving a loaded firearm in the reach of a child.' 

Sophie collapsed in March under the effects of the heroin substitute after an eye witness said she looked 'groggy' and was falling over.

Paramedics rushed to the family home where the couple lived on benefits but despite attempting to revive her, the toddler was pronounced dead in hospital just 35 minutes later.

Tests later showed Sophie had traces of four separate drugs in her hair including heroin, cocaine and diazepam and had been exposed to the drugs for several months. 

Police later found a quarter of a pint of methadone and the Tom and Jerry Beaker in the back garden

These are the scenes of squalor which awaited police when they they arrived at the terraced family home

It has emerged Sophie's father openly smoked heroin in the same room as his daughter - she had traces four separate drugs in her hair including heroin, cocaine and diazepam and been exposed to the drugs for months

Three of her dummies had traces of cocaine powder on the teat. Methadone was also found on an upstairs bathroom sink.

The methadone had been prescribed to King as part of a drug treatment programme but she had been keeping the drug in her daughter's Tom and Jerry beaker, Tommy Tippy cup and Fruit Shoot bottles with a view to selling it on to fund her own drug habit.

After Sophie accidentally drank the substance, the couple tried to cover up their role in her death by hiding the beaker and fruit shoot bottles around the family home. 

They were also seen filling up a wheelie bin with nappies and drug taking equipment.

King sent two text messages to Jones relating to the child's drinking cup - one reading 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing'. Another said 'don't tip the methadone out, hide it.' 

Today pictures of the family's home taken by Lancashire Police emerged as Blackpool Council confirmed a serious case review was underway into the toddler's death.

Neightbours have questioned why Sophie was allowed to live with tbe two drug addicts after it emerged her father openly smoked heroin in the same room as his daughter. 

It is believed there was no social services file into the family open at the time of Sophie's death.

Barry Jones, 42, and Michelle King, 30, were convicted of the killing of Sophie Jones at Preston Crown Court. King admitted manslaughter and child cruelty whilst Jones was convicted of unlawful killing and child cruelty

Father of two Adrian Walenciej, 32, a bar worker who lives in the same street said: 'How can there be two drug addicts with a daughter and no supervision? 

'I'm blaming myself, thinking I could have done something and called the council.

'I'll always think if I had done something she could still be here. I thought they were drinking a lot but I didn't know the mum was dealing methadone.

'Accidents happen; a child can reach for medicine but what they did is unimaginable. 

'You hear about kids who are born with a drug addiction. Maybe they had tried giving her a bit of methadone to stop her crying before and it had worked? 

'We don't know what happened behind those walls, only they know. Nothing will bring that little girl back.'

Another neighbour said: 'That couple should be locked up for good. A child does not ask to be put in that situation.

'You do wonder whether they meant for her to drink it but only they know exactly what happened. 

'People put teddies outside the front door of the house after Sophie died. I put one there myself because I have children and can't imagine how any mum could do that to her daughter.

The court heard a neighbour said in the run up to the tragedy he had often heard arguing between the adults and Sophie would be heard crying for long periods.

The trial also heard on March 4 King sent several text messages to a drug user reminding her that she owed her £25.

She had also gone to buy crack cocaine before returning home. A relative saw Sophie fall on two occasions and noticed that she was unsteady on her feet.

King was heard to say that Sophie was acting weird and Barry to say 'I hope you've not left the top off your tablets'. 

Blackpool Council have confirmed they have launched a serious case review which is being led by Blackpool Children's Safeguarding Board and involves agencies including the council, health service and police

The methadone was prescribed to King  but she had been keeping the drug in her daughter's Tom and Jerry beaker, Tommy Tippy cup and Fruit Shoot bottles with a view to sell them on to fund her drug habit

Neighbours left flowers and toys outside the family home in Blackpool following Sophie's death in March

Three of Sophie's dummies had traces of cocaine powder on the teat and methadone was found on a sink

The couple were told to call an ambulance but they lied about taking Sophie to a walk in centre and claimed the child may have drunk some cider.

They also hid the beaker and fruit shoot bottles around the family home. The pair were also seen filling up a wheelie bin with nappies and drug taking equipment.

Eventually at 11.40pm, Jones made a 999 calmly saying: 'I have a two-year-old daughter, right, and I don't think she's breathing - can I have an ambulance please.' 

An ambulance arrived three minutes after the call and found him in the lounge performing CPR on Sophie following directions being given over the phone. 

Vomit was visible in Sophie's hair, face, chest and on the floor and appeared to contain blood.

While Sophie was in hospital King sent two text messages to Jones relating to the child's drinking cup - one reading 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing'. Another said 'don't tip the methadone out, hide it.'

Hidden under a green cover in the back yard police found 146ml of methadone - approximately 1/4 of a pint

Police found traces of cocaine and heroin in the bins and a number of fruit shoot bottles inside the house

But hidden under a green cover in the back yard police found 146ml of methadone - approximately 1/4 of a pint and the Tom and Jerry beaker. 

They also found a large number of Fruit Shoot bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside. There were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins.

Tests showed Sophie's cause of her death was inhalation of stomach contents and poisoning by methadone - less than a teaspoonful can kill a child.

At Preston Crown Court King admitted manslaughter and child cruelty whilst Jones was convicted of unlawful killing and child cruelty following a trial.

Today Detective Inspector Andy Cribbin, of Lancashire Police, said: 'Sophie's death was as a direct result of the actions and neglect of her parents, the two people who should have protected her from coming to any harm whatsoever.

'Her death was wholly avoidable and was brought about by their chaotic and reckless use of illegal and prescribed drugs within the family home.

'Storing methadone in a child's drinking cup is akin to leaving a loaded firearm in the reach of a child - the outcome was almost inevitable.'

Blackpool Council confirmed the serious case review was being led by Blackpool Children's Safeguarding Board and involves agencies including the council, health service and police.
