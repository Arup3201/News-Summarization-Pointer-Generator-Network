Jailed publicist Max Clifford is being sued by former Royal butler Paul Burrell over claims that he secretly faxed a confidential letter to a newspaper containing private information about the Queen.

The High Court writ was served on Clifford in his cell at Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, where he is serving an eight-year jail sentence for indecently assaulting eight women and girls in the 1970s and 1980s.

Burrell went to Clifford for help in 2001 when he was at the centre of a media storm after being accused of stealing hundreds of Princess Diana’s possessions.

At Clifford’s request, he wrote a six-page letter setting out his relationship with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, including details of personal gifts he had received from the Royals and the Queen’s interest in the birth of his first son.

Later, on legal advice, Burrell decided not to use Clifford’s services. But an angry Clifford faxed the letter to Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the now defunct News of the World, it is claimed. The NotW did not publish its details.

Along with information about Burrell’s relationship with the Royals, the letter also detailed ‘a serious accident’ he suffered while in the US with the Queen and the medical treatment she arranged for him.

Other ‘inherently private’ material included ‘the Queen’s interest in the birth’ of Burrell’s son and details of gifts she gave him. Burrell is seeking damages of up to £50,000 and an injunction banning Clifford from using or publishing any private information about him.

Legal experts believe that if successful, the claim could lead to other public figures seeking similar gagging orders. In the past, Clifford, now 71, cast himself as the custodian of hundreds of celebrity secrets, claiming most of his work involved keeping stories out of newspapers.

The writ says Burrell, 56, suffered ‘substantial distress as a result of the misuse of his private information’.

However in a statement, Clifford said it was an ‘affront to common sense’ to suggest Burrell felt able to claim the information was confidential when ‘he has sold stories to newspapers… and has even written a book about his dealings with the Royal Family’. According to the writ, Burrell first went to Clifford wanting to ‘stem the torrent of adverse publicity’ following his arrest after allegations that £6 million worth of Diana’s possessions went missing from her Kensington Palace apartments.

The PR guru was alleged to have told Burrell that his role was to protect people, but to do that he needed to know everything about them, and kept all his clients’ secrets in a safe. Burrell duly gave him the letter.

But Clifford, Burrell claims, became extremely angry when he terminated his relationship with him in spring 2002 following a warning by his criminal defence team.

Burrell accuses Clifford of faxing the letter to Ms Brooks at 11.58am on November 2, 2002 – the morning after the butler was cleared of theft at the Old Bailey after it was revealed the Queen had come forward with crucial evidence.

He claims this was a breach of confidentiality and adds that he had previously ignored an offer of £450,000 from the paper for his story.

In the book, A Royal Duty, Burrell describes how he fell down stairs and ruptured a disc during a trip to Kentucky. An ambulance took him to a nearby hospital which had ‘already set aside a Royal suite for an emergency’ in line with procedure for Royal visits.

‘It was the first time a crippled Royal servant had slept in the Queen’s bed,’ he wrote.
