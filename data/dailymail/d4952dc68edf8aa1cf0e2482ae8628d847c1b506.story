The grieving family of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes will make an emotional return to the Sydney Cricket Ground to pay tribute following the batman's tragic death.

The 25-year-old died from severe head injuries on November 27, two days after being hit on the head by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shied match at the famous cricket ground.

His parents Gregory and Virginia, sister Megan and brother Jason will arrive in Sydney on Monday from Coffs Harbour, north coast of NSW to watch the five-day final Test against India this week.

Speaking on behalf of the family, Jason told The Sunday Telegraph it was important for the family to return to the ground where 'Phil made his professional mark'.

The 25-year-old was struck in the head by a delivery during day one of the Sheffield Shield match between New South Wales and South Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on November 25

'Whether we stay for all five days will depend on how mum and dad are feeling,' he said.

'My sister and I are just trying to be strong for mum and dad. We're doing what we can to support them because that's what Phil would have wanted.' 

Australian skipper Michael Clarke will  join the family, who will have their own private suite at the ground, to offer his support during his breaks when he commentates the Test match.

Clarke told The Sunday Telegraph: 'They have shown incredible strength over the past couple of months and it will be great to see them back out at the ground where they watched their son and brother score so many runs for NSW, South Australia and Australia.'

In honour of Hughes, SCG will also place a plaque outside the home-team dressing room while former team mates will also make an appearance and spend some time with the family. 

The batman's funeral service was held last month in his hometown of Macksville as thousands bid an emotional farewell as they gathered to say their goodbyes.

Meanwhile mourners across the globe paid tribute to the cricketer by placing their beloved cricket bats outside their homes as a sign of respect and posting it on social media with the hashtag #putoutyourbats.
