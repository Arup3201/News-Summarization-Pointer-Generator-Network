AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli has often shown off his skills on the football pitch, but has now appeared in video footage showcasing his talents at basketball.

The Italian, who used to play for Manchester City, was seen ‘slam dunking’ the ball one-handed into the basket.

It is not the first time the enigmatic frontman has been seen practising his basketball skills. Last year, Balotelli played with team-mates Mbaye Niang and Stephan El Shaarawy in Miami before their 2-0 victory over LA Galaxy.

Slam dunk! And he jumps and slots the ball home with just one hand

He also shot footage of himself ‘slam-dunking’ in April, with the caption ‘Kobe [Bryant} I got this,’ thus comparing himself to the modern-day Los Angeles Lakers legend.

Milan embarked on a tour of America again this summer, taking part in the Guinness International Champions Cup, an eight team competition of which Manchester United and Liverpool will contest the final on Monday night in Miami.

Balotelli and his team-mates, along with new manager Filippo Inzaghi, endured a disappointing tournament, however, losing all three games against AC Milan, Liverpool and Olympiacos with just a single goal scored to their name.

Shoot! He also has a go at a longe-ranger

The Italian, who netted 14 league goals for the Rossoneri last season, will hope the sharp shooting and leverage he showed on the basketball court will help the club to better their eighth-place finish in Serie Aand re-establish themselves in European football.

Balotelli has also been linked with a move to Arsenal and Liverpool this summer.
