Alison Morton of Buxton, Derbyshire, who had breast cancer in 2007 and had surgery to remove her left breast

A gel rubbed onto the skin to shrink tumours could transform the treatment of breast cancer for thousands of women.

The
 lotion, applied daily, contains the same active ingredient found in 
Tamoxifen pills, the most commonly used breast cancer drug in Britain.

Research suggests the gel is as effective as the tablets at controlling the disease but, crucially, has fewer side-effects.

In pill form, the drug causes nausea and  hot flushes in half of women, while one in four will have extreme fatigue.

More
 serious complications, such as blood clots that could cause a stroke 
and an increased risk of womb cancer, affect one in 100 patients on the 
drug.

Tamoxifen works by blocking the effects of the hormone 
oestrogen. Many types of breast cancer rely on this hormone to grow and 
have special receptors that oestrogen can lock onto.

Tamoxifen sits 
on these receptors and gets in the hormone's way, and is usually given 
after surgery to reduce the risk of a tumour coming back.

Many women 
stay on the drug for five years after their diagnosis. However, it's 
estimated that up to half quit before then because they're put off by 
the side-effects.

These include former care worker Alison Morton, 
51, who was diagnosed with breast cancer seven years ago. The mother of 
three had a mastectomy after the discovery of a hormone-sensitive tumour
 the size of a 50p piece.

Alison was prescribed Tamoxifen to reduce 
her chances of the cancer returning and - as her sister had breast 
cancer at 42 and her mother had died of kidney cancer at 54 - she was 
happy to give it a go. She soon changed her mind.

'As soon as I 
started taking it I began to feel sick all day, like morning sickness,' 
says Alison who lives in Buxton,  Derbyshire, with husband, Neil, 50, a 
gas engineer. 'I had no appetite and lost a stone in the first few 
weeks.

'Within two days I had severe hot flushes every couple of 
minutes, sweating so much people would say my face was streaming. I had 
to change my clothes eight or nine times a day. I felt embarrassed and 
didn't want to go out and socialise - and I was only 44.'

She also 
became so sensitive to sunlight that her eyes hurt when she went outside
 and she had severe night sweats. 'I had to sleep on a bath towel and 
get up and change it in the night as it would be soaked,' says Alison.

She was offered treatment with the drug Tamoxifen but found the drug side effects too troublesome

'Even
 though I was flushed and sweaty, I also felt cold and shivery. The 
sweats disturbed my husband's sleep as well as mine and I also felt 
self-conscious.'

Eventually, she tried sleeping pills, but still woke
 up in the night drenched in sweat. Alison had never been depressed 
before, but Tamoxifen made her tearful.

She persevered for 50 days, hoping her body would adjust, but then decided enough was enough and came off the drug.

'I
 know all the facts about Tamoxifen and how it can reduce your chances 
of breast cancer recurring, but for me the side-effects were too much to
 bear.

'The impact on my quality of life was too high a price to 
pay. I would rather take my chances with breast cancer than live with 
Tamoxifen's side-effects.' A recent study by Glasgow University found 
400 lives and £30 million could be saved each year if women continued 
with Tamoxifen.

It's hoped the gel will boost the numbers of women staying on the treatment, increasing their chances of long-term survival.

It
 is likely to have fewer side-effects because while the pill has to be 
broken down by the liver and then circulated round the body, the gel is 
applied only to the area affected by the tumour. It seeps through the 
skin into the breast tissue.

Tamoxifen has been the gold standard in
 breast cancer treatment for the past 20 years and is credited with 
playing a major part in a 30 per cent decline in the death toll from the
 disease. It's not just given to those who have had breast cancer - 
it's also recommended for those at high risk of developing the disease.

Last
 June, the National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence - NICE - 
recommended that the drug be given to any women over 35 whose family 
history gave them more than a 17 per cent risk of developing hormone 
sensitive breast cancer: 488,000 women in this country. There has been a
 hold-up in putting this recommendation into practice because the drug 
has not been licensed for women who have yet to develop breast cancer 
and so doctors are nervous of prescribing it.

Yet even if these women were offered the drug, the side-effects mean many may choose not to  take it.

Given
 that so many women are reluctant to stick with the tablets, scientists 
at Northwestern University, near Chicago, wanted to see if a daily 
application of gel would  be as good at stopping the return of cancer as
 pills, with fewer adverse effects.

They recruited 26 women aged 
from 45 to 86 with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, which accounts for
 one in four breast cancers. It's a less serious form of the disease, as
 the cancer cells are inside the ducts of the breast and do not normally
 spread.

Half the women received the gel, which they applied every day, and half took the oral version of the drug.

Researchers
 took regular breast tissue samples to monitor levels of a protein, 
Ki-67, that is a marker for cancer cell growth. Raised levels suggest 
cancer cells are multiplying. The results, published in the journal 
Clinical Cancer Research last month, showed that after six to ten weeks,
 Ki-67 levels had been reduced by similar amounts (50 to 60 per cent) in
 gel and pill patients - suggesting the gel was just as good as the 
drug.

Alison had never been depressed before, but Tamoxifen made her tearful

But the amount of potentially toxic medicine circulating in patients' bloodstreams was five times lower in those on the gel.

Researcher
 Professor Seema Khan said: 'The gel minimised exposure to the rest of 
the body and concentrated the drug in the breast where it is needed.'

The gel reduced the risk of blood clots, but it did not reduce the incidence of hot flushes.

However,
 researchers believe this is because the group was too small to give 
fully accurate results and they expect bigger studies would show a 
reduction in flushes.

Professor Khan says the gel may also be more 
effective for some women because one in three lack the right enzymes in 
the liver to properly metabolise oral Tamoxifen.

Cancer Research UK 
science information officer Dr Emma Smith said: 'Research looking at 
ways to  make cancer treatment kinder is hugely important and this 
simple  approach shows promise for this type of breast cancer. But the 
study only looked at a small number of women.'

Professor Tony Howell,
 scientific director at the Genesis Breast Cancer prevention charity in 
Manchester, said the study was interesting because it found a gel could 
reduce the risk of blood clots and was as effective as tablets in 
reducing cancer cell growth.

However, he added: 'Blood clot problems are rare with Tamoxifen, though, and hot flushes are a much more common side-effect.'

Researchers
 are in talks with the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. over plans 
to set up a much bigger trial - potentially involving hundreds of women.

If
 this produces the same positive results, it's possible the gel could 
become available within the next two to three years. It could make all 
the difference for women like Alison who, in the end, opted to have her 
ovaries removed to stop her from producing oestrogen.

'The gynaecologist was  sympathetic - he said my family history warranted it,' she says.

So, would she have been tempted to have tried the new gel instead?

'It
 sounds as if it has a far less toxic effect than the Tamoxifen I was 
given and is just as effective at fighting cancer,' says Alison. 'I 
definitely would have tried it if it had been available at the time.'
