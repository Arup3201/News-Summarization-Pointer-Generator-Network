Alexis Sanchez is renowned for his relentless speed but even the Arsenal winger would struggle to keep pace with this artist's skills... at least when filmed in time lapse video.

Gunners fan and artist @DemooseArt has recreated an image of the Chilean forward using only a collection of pens at his disposal and filmed the entire process using a speeded up camera.

Beginning with Sanchez's hairline, the artist develops an incredibly detailed picture of the club's marquee summer signing (complete with his No 17) in less than three minutes.

The finished product is incredibly detailed while the artist has also produced drawings of Lionel Messi

@DemooseArt has featured more impressive work on his YouTube site, including pen drawings of Chelsea’s Diego Costa, World Cup winner Mario Gotze and Barcelona star Lionel Messi.

Meanwhile, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has claimed that Arsene Wenger is better than Jose Mourinho and should be afforded more respect from disgruntled Arsenal fans.

‘I think everyone at Arsenal knows he’s done a magnificent job. For me, he’s the second best manager in Premier League history (behind Sir Alex Ferguson). Jose (Mourinho) hasn’t done enough yet,' said Pardew.

Sanchez has been a revelation since arriving at Arsenal - scoring nine goals from 13 league games

Arsene Wenger deserves more respect from Arsenal fans, according to Newcastle boss Alan Pardew
