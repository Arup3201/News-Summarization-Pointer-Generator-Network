FIFA have got themselves into yet another potentially explosive muddle over the report into World Cup bid corruption that has already descended into farce.

After the debacle of investigator Michael Garcia disowning the summary of his own report by ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, the buck was passed to FIFA compliance chief Domenico Scala to decide the next step after reviewing all the documents.

And FIFA hope Scala will put enough evidence from the full Garcia report to the executive committee meeting in Morocco next month for them to decide once and for all whether a re-vote is needed over the staging of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Michael Garcia is probing the conduct of five FIFA officials - including three who are still on the executive

But to complicate matters, Garcia is still probing the individual conduct of five people — three believed still to be on the executive, one a high-profile former member and another a powerful ex-FIFA official.

And Zurich insiders believe it will be impossible for Scala to divulge fresh information from the Garcia file to the executive in Marrakech on December 18-19 — even with names redacted — without compromising Garcia’s inquiries, especially if they involve three people who will be in the room.

Christmas looks to have been cancelled by Arsenal as far as their supporters are concerned. The traditional festive drinks with Arsenal fan groups may well be ditched this year, with the club seemingly sensitive to any criticism of under-pressure manager Arsene Wenger. Last year the Gunners waited until the day after their Christmas bash with fans before announcing ticket price rises. An Arsenal spokesman said they were organising a larger gathering of supporters for an end-of-season party.

Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, who is married to the Queen’s granddaughter Zara Phillips but has time on his hands after leaving his role coaching Gloucester, is understood to have signed up for a reality show.

The William Hill sports book of the year award has a habit of going to a rank outsider — indeed, the more obscure the better. Gareth Thomas’s autobiography and a Bobby Moore biography would probably be the favourites at Thursday’s ceremony but a book about running up and down Mt Kilimanjaro may beat them to the prize.

Coe says 'oui' to IAAF

It has been assumed since Lord Coe said athletics was ‘in his DNA’ when turning down the chance to lead the BBC Trust that he preferred to run for the IAAF presidency.

And it is understood Coe will announce in French sports newspaper L’Equipe that he is officially in the running to succeed Lamine Diack next August. The choice of a French media outlet suggests Coe is positioning himself as an international statesman rather than a British one and French is an important language in the athletics community.

Lord Moynihan, who has led the House of Lords’ all-party campaign to regulate the secondary ticket market, is hopeful that the Government will take notice of the peers winning a rare amendment. This would see greater transparency in online ticket selling in time for next autumn’s Rugby World Cup. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid is opposed to the changes but the Government response will be led by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, whose Secretary of State Vince Cable is the MP for Twickenham, of all places.

The haphazard preparations for the 2016 Olympics in Rio include having to lengthen the iconic rowing course at Lagoa by 30 metres at the start and the finish to allow the requisite amount of slow-down water between the finish line and the end of the lake.

The FA have finally decided to employ headhunters in their search for a new general secretary to replace Alex Horne, with Odgers helping the recruitment hunt. FA chairman Greg Dyke had been keen to avoid the cost but was persuaded otherwise by the FA board for reasons of transparency.
