The security team charged with defending the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 say they were told to 'stand down' for nearly half an hour after it was attacked, a new book reveals.

The team, who were stationed in a nearby CIA annex, allege that they were ready to go within five minutes of the attack starting but were ordered not to deploy by a top CIA chief.

Instead they waited in their vehicle before eventually ignoring their orders and moving into battle. By the time they arrived,  ambassador Christopher Stevens was dead, along with American Sean Smith.

The team say if they had been allowed to deploy earlier, those men would still be alive.

The CIA team charged with protecting the U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya when it was attacked in 2012 say they were told to 'stand down' for half an hour by a CIA official after the attacks began

The team say if they had been allowed to deploy immediately Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador, and American Sean Smith would not have been killed

Speaking to Fox News, commando John Tiegen, said: 'I strongly believe if we'd left immediately, they'd still be alive today.'

In a new book called 13 Hours, Tiegen and four of his colleagues discuss what happened that night for the first time from a soldier's perspective.

They say word of the attack first reached the CIA building at 9.30pm, and they got ready in such a hurry that one of the team forgot to put underwear on, while another was dressed in cargo shorts.

But as they climbed into their vehicle fully armed and ready to go, a commander identified only as 'Bob', told them to wait.

Tiegen recalls telling the commander, 'Hey, we gotta go now! We’re losing the initiative!' but was told 'No, stand down, you need to wait,' reports the New York Times.

According to the commandos, the chief later told them that Libyan militias were being called in, but the Libyan guards at the consulate compound deserted without firing a shot, and no other support ever came.

Eventually, the commandos received a radio message from the compound: 'If you guys do not get here, we are going to die!' At that point, in defiance of their orders, the men went to help.

At around 10.30pm the team made it into the compound and rounded up the surviving personnel before loading them into a convoy.

They were unable to find ambassador Stevens, who by that time had died from suffocation after the buildings had been set alight.

As the team moved out of the diplomatic compound their convoy was attacked, and once they were inside the CIA annex, that too became the target of rocket and small arms fire.

These patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes as the commandos fought on-and-off battles with gunmen lurking in side streets and alleyways.

Around the same time, a CIA security team based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, landed at Benghazi airport.

In a new book, the security team say they were told three times not to deploy, before eventually ignoring their orders and driving to the beseiged compound

The commandos say officials tried to bring in local Libyan militias to help, along with heavier weapons, but no meaningful support materialised until the next morning

Not long before dawn, the reinforcements from Tripoli managed to take themselves and a convoy of vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for an evacuation.

Just after they arrived mortars began firing on the base, killing another two  security officers after they took a direct hit from one of the shells.

It took until 5.30am, a full nine hours after the attack began, for Libyan security forces to arrive with heavy weapons.

A security services spokesman denied the claims, saying: 'A prudent, fast attempt was made to rally local support for the rescue effort and secure heavier weapons.'

The official said 'there was no second-guessing those decisions being made on the ground' and 'there were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support.'
