Luis Suarez climbed off the bench at half time to spark a dramatic comeback against Almeria leaving Barcelona supporters asking why he wasn’t on the pitch from the kick-off.

Barca coach Luis Enrique left more than £150million of talent out of his starting line-up against a struggling team without a home win all season and had to change the disastrous team selection at half time to avoid defeat.

Suarez and Neymar were both  introduced at the break after a goal from former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma gave Almeria a shock lead.

Suarez dragged Barca back into the game cracking an acrobatic volley on to the cross bar and then setting up Neymar and Jordi Alba for the two goals that won Barcelona the match.

It has been a week for strange team selections and Luis Enrique’s starting line-up topped even Brendan Rodgers’ decisions in midweek at theBernabeu. Gerard Pique, Xavi, Dani Alves, Suarez and Neymar were all left on the bench against an Almeria team yet to win at home.

Almeria, whose first team is worth around 10 times less than that all-star bench, could not believe their good fortune.

They defended comfortably and attacked with purpose throughout the first half. Thievy, who was particularly prominent, put his team ahead on 37 minutes and it was no more than the strugglers deserved.

Lionel Messi was dispossessed on the edge of his own area and the reaction from Barcelona said much for their current form. The Argentine failed to respond, dropping his head and beginning his stroll back towards his own half. Those around him also seemed to stand still. 

Messi had only lost the ball because none of the six players ahead of him had been in a position where they could be passed to. No-one pressurised Fernando Soriano, who swept the ball forward to Thievy.

The striker sprinted clear of Javier Mascherano and Marc Bartra and slipped the ball past the advancing Claudio Bravo.

Trailing 1-0 at half-time Barça were 45 minutes from losing three league games on the bounce for the first time since 2003. Luis Enrique’s team selection had back-fired with disastrous consequences. 

It must have been an uncomfortable visitors’ dressing room as he faced his players having already sent Suarez and Neymar out to warm up. Both came on at the start of the second half.

Barça had mustered just one first half chance of note with Ivan Rakitic from the left and Messi looping a header on to the bar.

Suarez’s second-half introduction almost brought the equalizer on the hour when he hit the cross-bar with an acrobatic volley after a Rakitic corner had been flicked on.

And the former Liverpool man then wriggled clear down the right before centering for Neymar to roll in the equaliser. He could have put Barca ahead from the same right wing channel but his cross shot went just the wrong side of Ruben’s post.

The Uruguay star then teed-up Messi but the Argentine headed on to the bar for the second time in the game.

As the clock ticked down it looked as if Suarez second half show might bring only a point but with six minutes left he crossed from the right and Alba stroked the ball past Ruben for the winner.

arça had their three points but Enrique’s team selection had made hard work of it and he had Suarez's second half performance to thank for the turnaround.
