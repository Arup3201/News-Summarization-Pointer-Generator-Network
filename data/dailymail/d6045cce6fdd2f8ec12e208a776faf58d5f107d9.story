His twins are yet to leave hospital but Prince Albert of Monaco is taking fatherhood in his stride if this morning's visit to a nursery is any indication.

The royal, 56, was at the nursery to play Father Christmas to an excited group of children and was all smiles as he handed out prettily wrapped gifts.

But there was no sign of his wife, Princess Charlene, 36, who remains in hospital with their baby twins Jacques and Gabriella.

Albert, who was with his wife when she gave birth by caesarean section last Wednesday, was then driven to the headquarters of the Monaco Red Cross, where he handed out food parcels.

The new babies, the first for the couple, have displaced Albert's sister Princess Caroline in the Monégasque line of succession, with Jacques now heir to the principality.

While Charlene recovers, Albert has been busy preparing for the babies' public unveiling on the 7th January, which will see the twins presented to the citizens of Monaco from the balcony of the Palais Princier.

On Friday, he held court at the birth certificate ceremony, which was witnessed by 20 grandees, among them Albert's youngest sister Princess Stephanie.

And the Monégasque royals aren't the only ones delighted by the birth of the twin babies. Princess Charlene's South African family have also spoken of their happiness at the birth.

Speaking to South African news channel ENCA, Charlene's father Mike Wittstock said the family is thrilled and had received the news of the birth from Prince Albert himself.

'He called us and told us himself that things are good,' said the delighted grandfather. 'He gave us all the details, the babies’ names and all that, and said Charlene was doing very well.'

Mr Wittstock, who has previously insisted that his new royal grandchildren would be treated the same as the others, is also planning a trip to the principality to meet the twins. 

'We will now wait for things to settle down and then I will send my wife [Lynette] over first,' he said. 'That kind of thing is more of a woman’s job. Then I’ll go and join them a bit later.'

Since the birth on Wednesday, congratulatory messages have been flooding in from around the world, with King Mohammed VI of Morocco among those to send a note.

In his, the Moroccan royal spoke of his joy at the birth, before adding: 'I am glad to hear the happy news which, I am sure, filled the princely family and Monaco's people with joy.'

News of the birth, which was greeted by a 42-cannon salute, brought hundreds of people on to the streets of Monaco, while buildings, among them the Palais Princier, have been festooned with the red and white national flags.

The twin babies are the first children to be born to Princess Charlene and her husband, although Albert does have an illegitimate daughter and son from previous relationships.

The eldest, daughter Jazmin, 22, was born following a fling with former waitress Tamara Rotolo. He denied being her father for years before DNA tests proved otherwise when she was a teenager.

Albert also has a younger son, Alexandre Coste, 11, is the result of an affair with Nicole Coste, a Togolese former Air France hostess.

Under Monaco's inheritance laws, neither of them have any claim to royal titles or to be considered as heirs to Albert because they were born outside of marriage.

They do however have legal rights to a share of his huge personal fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine to exceed $1 billion (800 million euros).

Going home: Princess Charlene, who has been recovering from the birth, is expected to leave hospital soon

Legitimate: The babies are the heirs to Albert's throne and replace his sister Caroline
