The LTA’s Roehampton headquarters sits next door to the sports ground of the Bank of England and now they have something else in common — they are both to be run by Canadians.

For Mark Carney at one sometimes strife-ridden British institution read Michael Downey at another, albeit slightly less important one.

Downey, the 56-year-old chief executive of Tennis Canada, was yesterday brought in to run the Lawn Tennis Association, his mission to try to build the sport up to a level befitting the country which hosts its most prestigious tournament.

Taking over from the polarising and 
well-rewarded figure of Roger Draper, no time was wasted in declaring a 
break from certain aspects associated with the seven-year reign that is 
about to end.

Firstly, LTA 
chairman David Gregson volunteered that Downey would be paid a salary of
£300,000, less than half the package that Draper took home last year, 
which included a bonus of £200,000 and £40,000 in pension payments.

Secondly,
Downey, who will take charge in January, emphasised that his vision for
the LTA was a broad church. No more would the governing body regard 
outside constituencies of the sport — be they maverick coaches, parents 
or private academies — as a potential threat but as partners to help the
game grow.

In 2008, the Rogers Cup tournaments set a record for combined sales and rank among the top global events in terms of attendance and profitability.

'We can’t do it 
all ourselves,’ was among the many encouraging statements the new man 
made when unveiled at the end of a prolonged search that saw 350 
applications and nearly 30 interviews.

He
will, of course, be judged by actions rather than words, but he has 
been turned to after a successful nine years in Canada which has seen a 
combination of increased grass-roots participation and improved elite 
performance.

Although not a 
high-profile figure in the world game, he has built up a good 
reputation, albeit in a country where the pressure to deliver is not the
same. It could hardly be otherwise with Wimbledon just down the road 
and more than £30million being pumped into the game from that event’s 
profits alone.

While some 
will regret the fact the successful candidate is not British, Downey’s 
lack of baggage and outsider status may make it easier to make the tough
decisions needed to change the culture of the organisation.

The
downside is that it will take time for him to understand some of the 
sport’s nuances here. Downey pledged to change the image of the LTA. 'I 
wouldn’t have joined this organisation if I thought it was useless,’ he 
said.

He pledged to learn 
fast and travel outside the M25, similar to what he has done in Canada, 
where strong relationships in the outlying provinces of that vast 
country have been developed. He was most definitely right in describing 
the job as a ‘fantastic opportunity’ because the potential is there.

Andy
Murray — recuperating from what is initially said to have been a 
successful back operation — has put a spring in the step of British 
tennis since his triumph at Wimbledon.

'That
inspires people. Andy’s greatest contribution to tennis in Great 
Britain is winning,' said Downey. The manner of these things is that 
there is always a honeymoon period that follows such appointments.

There
is much hard work and many hard decisions ahead to improve access to 
the sport in a country where, he will find, football is his new ice 
hockey
