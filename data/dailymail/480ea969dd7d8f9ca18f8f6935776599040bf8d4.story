Some forces insist on sentences of more than three years before they release a custody photo to the press

A new secret justice row broke out last night after The Mail on Sunday discovered that hundreds of thousands of convicted criminals are having their identities protected by police.

More than half of forces in England and Wales refuse to publish mugshots of offenders unless they have been jailed – in defiance of national guidelines.

Some insist on sentences of more than three years before they release a custody photo to the press, citing concerns about data protection and the criminals’ human rights.

This means just a tiny handful of the 1.2 million people sentenced in criminal courts each year have their pictures published or put online, even though it is widely acknowledged that publicity can link offenders to other crimes and prevent more from being committed.

It comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed ‘secret arrest’ plans by police chiefs, backed by Lord Justice Leveson and now put in place across the country, to prevent forces revealing the names of suspects they have detained. 

Following this newspaper’s investigation, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ senior officer in charge of media policy wrote to all 43 chief constables in England and Wales urging them to release more photos of sentenced offenders.

Andy Trotter, the chief constable of British Transport Police, said last night: ‘I’m a little disappointed and hence I’ve written to chiefs today.

‘I am disappointed to find a variety of responses to your inquiries and I’m reminding chiefs that this is the policy. I’m reminding forces of the existing guidance that encourages openness and co-operation.

‘We’ve got a good story to tell – crime is down, the prisons are full – and we want to see more court results in newspapers, not fewer. The default position ought to be we release photos unless there is a specific prohibition such as the person is a juvenile.’

He added that the length of an offender’s sentence should be ‘immaterial’ in deciding whether or not their image is released. It is not an infallible measure of the seriousness of a single crime because the sentence may be influenced by a previous record.

A survey of 39 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales sows that 28 require an offender to be given an immediate custodial term at the very least before their image can be released

‘That doesn’t make sense to me and I 
think that is arbitrary and I don’t think should be used as any sort of 
criterion to be applied to the release of images,’ said Mr Trotter.

Although
 the existing guidelines developed by ACPO in 2009 are not legally 
binding on forces, they encourage officers to release custody images to 
the media.

The guidelines 
state that publicising a criminal’s identity is justified if it serves a
 purpose such as aiding the detection of crime, encouraging witnesses 
and victims to come forward, reassuring residents, increasing confidence
 in the justice system or preventing future offences.

Forces are being urged to release pictures and details of more detained suspects

Although
 police are told to bear in mind the nature of the crime and the impact
 of releasing an image on the perpetrator and their family, there is no 
reference to sentencing thresholds. 

However,
 a survey by this newspaper of 39 of the 43 police forces in England and
 Wales has established that 28 require an offender to be given an 
immediate custodial term at the very least before their image can be 
released.

Of those 28 forces, six will publish mugshots only of those given terms of two years or more, and another six – Merseyside, North Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Cleveland, Durham and Staffordshire – insist on three years or longer.

Of the 1.2 million people sentenced in 2012, 98,047 (eight per cent) were given custodial terms. Of these, 10,731 were sentenced to more than three years behind bars.

One force, Dorset, even insists that media organisations remove photos of criminals from their websites a month after sentencing to ‘ensure proportionality’.

Most forces added that they would release images for those given shorter jail terms in exceptional cases if the press requested them.

A further 11 forces, including the Metropolitan Police, said they followed ACPO guidelines and considered each case individually rather than making custodial sentences a prerequisite.

New guidance on relations between police and the media will be finalised this summer and approved by the College of Policing, the new professional body for the force.

In one well-known case, Derbyshire Constabulary refused to release photographs of two murderers who had fled from an open prison, arguing that they had likely left the area and therefore posed no risk to residents. 

Pictures of Jason Croft and Michael Nixon were eventually published by another force.
