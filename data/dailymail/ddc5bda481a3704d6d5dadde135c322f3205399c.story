The first witness to encounter honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani after his wife was abducted at gunpoint has told how he believes the British businessman is innocent.

Simbonile Matokazi encountered Dewani, 32, on the outskirts of Cape Town minutes after the Briton claimed he was ejected from a taxi by armed hijackers who had sped off with his new bride Anni still inside.

Dewani will learn tomorrow whether he has won his High Court appeal against an order that he can be extradited to South Africa to face allegations of masterminding his wife’s murder during their honeymoon.

Caught on film: CCTV footage to be broadcast tonight on Panorama appears to show to show Dewani handing cash to the taxi driver Dewani allegedly paid in return for orchestrating his wife's killing

At the hotel: Carrying a bag, Shrien is followed by Zola Tongo - who has been jailed for organising the murder

The care home owner from Bristol has always strenuously denied any involvement in the killing of Mrs Dewani, 28, in Cape Town in November 2010.

Mr Matokazi told a Panorama documentary to be aired tonight he thought Dewani was 'genuine' when he told him the hijacking story when the pair met.

The BBC documentary will tonight broadcast CCTV footage which the South African authorities claim shows Dewani paying off the taxi driver who arranged the murder.

Other images taken by security cameras at
the five-star Cape Grace Hotel in Cape Town show the couple kissing 
affectionately hours before Mrs Dewani was shot dead.

Recalling his encounter with a shell-shocked Dewani in the Gugulethu township on the outskirts of Cape Town, Mr Matokazi, a local government auditor, told Panorama: 'I don’t think this guy had killed his wife.'

First witness: Simbonile Matokazi found Shrien Dewani after the robbery and subsequent murder of the latter's wife

He added: 'When I found out that he was accused I was a bit surprised, because when he told me his story that night I believed him and I thought what he was saying was the truth. And it was genuine.'

Mrs Dewani, from Sweden, was later found dead in the back of the abandoned cab with a bullet wound to her neck.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who has admitted his part in the crime, claimed in a plea agreement with prosecutors that Dewani ordered the carjacking and paid for a hit on his wife.

William Booth, chairman of the South African Law Society’s criminal law committee, raises concerns in the documentary about the way cases are investigated before they come to court in South Africa.

He told Panorama: 'The South African authorities are paying so much attention to the Dewani case to show the rest of the world that they are doing something about crime in South Africa. That is a big factor in this case.'

The Dewani family’s lawyer, Charlotte 
Harris, of Mishcon de Reya, said in a statement: 'Shrien has not been 
charged with any offence in any country.

'Despite
his offers at an early stage he has not been interviewed by the South 
African authorities in connection with any offence.

Tongo later leaves with the bag. He claims the bag contained 1,000 South African rand (about £82) in cash which was his payment for arranging the murder

Previously unseen: The footage was recorded three days after Anni was shot dead

Together: Shrien Dewani, pictured with Anni, has strictly denied any involvement in her murder

'Shrien is innocent and has always maintained his commitment to clearing his name of all the false allegations and slurs against him. He remains determined to fight for justice for his wife, Anni.

'As a British citizen this can only be done when he is well enough and when his personal safety can be guaranteed.'

The Honeymoon Murder: A Panorama Special will be broadcast on BBC One at 9pm tonight.
