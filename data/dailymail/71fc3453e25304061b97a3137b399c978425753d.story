A father has told how his toddler son bit into a fruit loaf and choked on a piece of blue plastic that had been baked into it.

Daniel Hall, 29, from Blackheath, south east London, said he noticed his one-year-old son, Nathan, struggling as he tucked into a slice of Marks & Spencer luxury fruit loaf.

He took a closer look and said he was 'horrified' to discover that there were two large pieces of blue plastic apparently baked into the bread which his son had been chewing on.

Little Nathan Hall of Blackheath, London, choked on this piece of blue plastic in his Marks & Spencer fruit loaf

Daniel Hall, 29, saw his one-year-old son struggling to eat a piece of M&S fruit loaf that had plastic in it

Mr Hall, a stay-at-home father, pulled the plastic from Nathan's mouth and called the shop to complain.

He said his wife then wrote to complain, asking for a refund and for an investigation into how the plastic had ended up in the bread.

Also, as instructed, she took the £1.40 loaf back to the Blackheath Simply Food branch where they had bought it. 

The food chain sent the couple a £10 voucher, but Mr Hall said he felt as though Marks & Spencer were fobbing them off.

He told the Evening Standard: 'We wrote to M&S, complained anything could have happened, and said it is disgusting that two large pieces were found in there.

They got back and sent us a letter with a £10 voucher, like it is no problem to them. 

'I want a bigger gesture than that.'

The Halls took the £1.40 fruit loaf back to their local Simply Food store but were angry to be given a £10 token

A spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: 'We’re sorry to hear about Mr Hall’s complaint. 

'Quality is extremely important to us and we’ve been working closely with our supplier to investigate what has happened. 

'We will continue to keep in touch with Mr Hall and update him on our findings.'
