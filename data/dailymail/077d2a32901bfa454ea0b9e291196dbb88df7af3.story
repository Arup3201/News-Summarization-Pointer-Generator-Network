What a heffer: An overweight cow at Oatridge 
College near Edinburgh. Britain's beef herd needs to go on a diet after 
gorging on high-sugar grass

It's a time of year when many Britons are still struggling to shed those extra pounds they gained over Christmas and are perhaps pinning hopes on the latest fad, the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet.

But eating too much, it seems, is not just a problem for humans.

Britain’s beef cattle have grown overweight after months of feeding on high-sugar grass – and now farmers have been warned to cut their rations.

Dr Basil Lowman of Scotland’s Rural 
College, said: ‘I have never known so many cows across Britain to be so 
overweight. They need to be slimmed down urgently.’

He said that overweight animals would experience health problems and have difficulty calving, so risking farmers’ livelihoods.

The problem has arisen because prolonged sunlight leads to increased sugar levels in grass.

Cattle
 were able to eat outside for longer during last year’s fine summer, and
 when they were moved into sheds for the winter they continued to enjoy 
their sweet treat in the form of silage made from the  grass.

Dr Lowman added: ‘It was a  season of plenty for cows.

‘There
 is always a greedy cow or two in a herd but I would say this year about
 15 to 20 per cent of every herd is too fat. These cows are on average 
at least 176lbs overweight.’

The
 bovine equivalent of a beer belly or muffin top is a fatty layer around
 the tail.

Dr Lowman said: ‘It’s as if someone has put the cow’s tail 
through a big Polo mint and put it on the cow’s back. They look obese.

‘The
 trouble is that farmers see their cows every day and don’t really 
notice if they’ve grown or put on excess weight. So they need to take a 
friend or a vet to look at them.

‘If the cows are too fat they will  be too tired to give birth. Calves may die and in extreme cases, cows will die, too.

‘This causes a massive welfare problem and is a huge loss to the farmer – probably about £2,000 per animal.

‘It is very difficult to get rid of fat, so the quicker the farmers put their cows on a diet the better.’

Healthier cows: There is always one or two 
greedy cows in a herd, says Dr Basil Lowman of Scotland's Rural College,
 but at the moment some 15 to 20 per cent of the whole of Britain's beef
 herd is too fat

Peter Scott, farm manager at Oatridge College near Edinburgh, admitted that 40 out of 100 cattle at the site were overweight and he urged fellow farmers to face up to the problem.

He said: ‘We’ve got about four weeks before calving begins. We’re weighing our cows regularly to get them fit. You can easily see that some of them are far too fat.’

Typically, a cow on a diet will eat 22lbs of straw a day, 4.4lbs of meal and drink seven gallons of water.

Chris Mallon, director of the National Beef Association, said: ‘This is a timely reminder for farmers to keep an eye on the condition of their cows.’
