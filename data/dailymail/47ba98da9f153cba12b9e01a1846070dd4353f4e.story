People from around the UK seem to have been having eerie premonitions of how the independence referendum will pan out - as maps of the UK with Scotland missing are appearing all over everyday objects.

After the ominous vision first appeared in a cloud and then a piece of chicken from KFC, web users reacted by posting jokey pictures of their own 'revelations'.

They include photographs of Britain appearing in pieces of bread, puddle and lumps of grilled cheese.

Butter together: This map of the UK made from bread rolls was created by Bake Off contestant Rob Smart

Wet Britain: Owen Paul posted this 'map of Britain' as a joke after the original stories came to light

But perhaps the most impressive was no accident - it is in fact an edible map of Britain made by a former contestant on The Great British Bake Off.

Rob Smart chose to include Scotland on his map - on the grounds, he says, that we are 'Butter Together'.

'I felt the referendum debate on both sides had become a bit heated and there needed to be some light relief,' said Mr Smart, from Hertfordshire.

'I created the shape out of aluminium to create a mould to bake the dough.

'I thought it was appropriate for the last day of the campaigning, because it has been getting quite nasty in the last few days.'

Ominous: Ella Harold described this piece of cheese as 'foreboding' when she found it last week

Comparison: Shannon Hudson provided a map to show how much her chicken looked like England

The 57-year-old baking enthusiast appeared on the hit BBC show last year, and made it to the fifth week of the competition.

Owen Paul tweeted a picture which he said showed a 'puddle I found in my brother's garden in Glasgow with Scotland missing'.

Another Twitter user, Sharon, posted 'left-over paratha shaped like an early map of Britain'.

And The Media Blog put up a photograph of a piece of bread, writing: 'Tell the papers! I was making toast when I noticed my bread looks a bit like the UK without Scotland. May be an omen.'

The craze apparently started when a Scottish woman living in England, Gillian Degnan, took a photograph of a cloud which looks like Britain without Scotland.

'I don't know whether it's an omen for the outcome of the Scottish referendum, but I wouldn't be surprised if Scotland vote Yes,' she said.

After the story came to light, Englishman Terry O'Neil revealed that he had found a piece of fried chicken which was also shaped like the possible future map of Britain.
