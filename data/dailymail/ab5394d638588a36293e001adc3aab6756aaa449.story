iPhone users have a reputation for being smug – and now they may have a good reason.

A recent study has found that people who use an iPhone are smarter than those who prefer Android devices.

This is based on research that found states with more college graduates also tend to have higher iPhone sales.

Scroll down for a breakdown of results by state... 

Alaska, Montana and Vermont have the largest number of iPhone users in the US. These states also have the highest percentage of college graduates in the US. Meanwhile, New Mexico, Iowa and Delaware have the lowest percentage of people who use iPhones

The study, by Massachusetts-based advertising group Chitika, discovered that Alaska, Montana and Vermont have the largest number of iPhone users in the US.

These states also have the highest percentage of college graduates.

Meanwhile, New Mexico, Iowa and Delaware have the lowest percentage of people who use iPhones, and a lower number of graduates.

As well as intelligence, the research found that wealth was linked to higher iPhone use – a factor that Chitika says is related to education.

The study also found that iPhone sales are linked to population density. The more densely populated an area, the more chance iPhone sales will be higher.

Previous research from TalkTalk mobile surveyed 2,000 smartphone users about their personality, habits and jobs. Apple owners were the most ambitious and vain, BlackBerry owners earned the most and people with Android phones are polite and more creative

Apple is chipping away at Samsung Electronics position in its home turf of South Korea - thanks to its new iPhone 6 series.

Apple captured a record 33 per cent market share in South Korea in November, the highest ever for a foreign brand, according to a monthly report released by Hong Kong-based market research company Counterpoint on Wednesday. 

In contrast, Samsung's share slipped to 46 per cent after hovering around 60 per cent for five months.

Apple's gains in South Korea are telling, as November was the first full month that the larger-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were sold in the country.

Other studies have uncovered similar results. Ladbrokes for instance, challenged a thousand smartphone users to take a series of online brain teasers designed to test their mental agility.

iPhone users were found to have the quickest wits of all, completing the test in 94 seconds, on average, while BlackBerry users were the slowest at 118 seconds.

In second place were Google Nexus owners, who completed the test just five seconds slower, on average, than top place Apple.

Although the fastest test of all was completed by a Samsung owner, at just 47 seconds, the group as a whole were in third place with an average completion time of 103 seconds.

HTC owners were fourth with an average time of 105 seconds, while people with Nokia handsets scored 109 seconds.

A study in 2013 found that iPhone owners are vainer and spend more on clothes and grooming than those who have BlackBerrys and Android phones.

BlackBerry owners earn the most and are more likely to have long-term relationships, while people with Android handsets have the best manners and are handy in the kitchen.

The study, commissioned by TalkTalk Mobile, surveyed 2,000 owners of the three major smartphone brands to determine whether the choice of handset was an extension of their personality.

On the whole, Google’s Android sales are higher than Apple’s, but the iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the US.

More than 42 per cent of smartphone are iPhones. The second most popular phone in the US market, according to Comscore, is Samsung.
