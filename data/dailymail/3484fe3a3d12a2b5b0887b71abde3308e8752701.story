Four children and two adults have been killed in a house fire in eastern Pennsylvania and authorities are now searching for the cause.

The blaze broke out around 11:55pm Sunday at the single-family home in Pottsville, about 90 miles northwest of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania's coal country. 

Firefighters later found the bodies inside, according to Schuylkill County emergency dispatch supervisor Bill Lindenmuth.

Inferno: Firefighters battle a towering blaze at a home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania

Cause unknown: It is not yet known what sparked the fire, and the fire marshal is investigating

Aftermath: The charred remains of the home are seen on Monday morning, after it was ravaged by flames

Witnesses told Fox 29 that the dead included 30-year-old Eric Brown, and his four children - two boys and two girls, ages 2,3, 7 and 8 - along with his 26-year-old sister-in-law, Christina Thomas.

The children's mother is believed to have escaped from the home.

Harrowing footage shot by FireandFilm.com shows heavy flames shooting out of nearly every window of the home. 

The fire was declared under control shortly before 1am.

Several firefighters were also reportedly injured while battling the flames.

A Pennsylvania State Police fire marshal was at the scene Monday morning.

The cause of the blaze wasn't immediately known.

Tragedy: The fire broke out at about 11:55pm on Sunday night

Battling the blaze: The chief of the fire department says that many of his firefighters had never seen a house fire like this before

Pottsville Fire Chief Todd March told Fox 29: 'It looks like it started back in the kitchen area. We're going to look at that, see if it has something to do with it.'

He added: 'The floors are burnt out in a lot of places, so we've got to watch what we're doing in there.'

Crews from all the city's fire companies responded.

For some of them, a fire with the intensity of the blaze last night was a new experience.

Chief March told Fox 29: 'We've had nothing like this before. A lot of the younger guys haven't had a fire death. A lot of the guys are affected by this, especially the kids.'

March said crews had to proceed carefully through the building because of the extensive amount of damage and firefighters were still pouring water on the home on Monday morning.

Messages left with a state police investigator and the coroner's office weren't immediately returned.
