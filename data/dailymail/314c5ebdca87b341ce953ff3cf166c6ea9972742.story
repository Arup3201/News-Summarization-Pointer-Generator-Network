A 16-year-old girl died after she swallowed up to eight 'bombs' of a drug nicknamed 'Dr Death' at a party, a court was told.

Ellie Jones began stumbling, shaking and suffering fits 'like she was possessed' after taking para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), at a house in Warrington, Cheshire, it was heard.

The former Catholic schoolgirl died in hospital just hours after taking the hallucinogenic drug, which has a similar effect to ecstasy but is much more poisonous.

Tragic: Ellie Jones, pictured, began stumbling, shaking and suffering fits 'like she was possessed' after taking PMA, a drug which has a similar effect to ecstasy, at a house in Warrington, Cheshire, a court heard

A 17-year old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared in court today accused of supplying Ellie and another teenager with PMA on the night of her death in May 2013. 

Halton Youth Court was told that Ellie spoke to the defendant on the way to the house party. 

One 17-year-old witness, known only as Boy A, said Ellie was overheard telling the defendant that she 'only had a fiver' and he replied that she could give him 'the other fiver' the following day. 

He then left the group for a few minutes claiming he was 'nipping round the corner.'

At the party later that evening, where the group were drinking vodka and beer, the suspect was seen with a plastic bag of white powder.

The witness told the court that the defendant started offering the substance to Ellie and other party guests. They took the drug wrapped inside cigarette paper and swallowed it whole like 'a bomb'. 

Ecstasy is considered pure when made with a strong concentration of the chemical MDMA. 

PMA, or PMMA, has a similar effect, but is much more poisonous. 

The effects of PMA, which include heightened intensity of emotions and alertness, take longer to set in than those of MDMA. 

As such drug-takers are more likely to double their dosage under the mistaken impression the substance is having no effect on them. 

According to Frank, a drug counselling organisation, a quarter of a tablet containing PMA is enough to kill. 

It can cause body temperatures to soar to fatal levels, bring on muscle spasms and sees blood pressure increase. 

Ellie was just one of more than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester whose deaths in 2013 were blamed on the drug.

Gym instructor Travis Barber, from Salford, was just 19 when he suffered a violent fatal reaction to PMA. 

Boy A said the defendant told him the drug was 'Whizz'. He added that Ellie had taken 'plenty' of bombs, but could not be sure exactly how many. 

He said: 'I say six but it could have been seven or eight or four or five. I definitely seen the defendant hand it over to Ellie several times. Every time he had one she matched it.'

The court heard that Ellie went upstairs to bed and appeared 'drunk' and 'sleepy'.

The witness added: 'She did seem a little bit restless. Me and [another guest] were upstairs for about 10 minutes whilst Ellie was sleeping. Me and [the friend] sparked up a joint.

He told the court that seemed 'comfortable' in bed and was falling asleep when they left to go back downstairs but when they returned she seemed as though she 'was getting agitated, restless.'

He said: We had to get her up and put her in another room. From about 10 minutes later in that room she started fitting. Everyone was panicking, no one knew what to do.'

The court heard the defendant had already gone to bed. Boy A added: 'He was sleeping. He didn't care. He was in the other room. He was holding his head, he didn't know what to do.

'Ellie must have been fitting for a good 20 minutes. [A girl] was trying to sit her up but she was too strong.

'They were saying "it's like she is possessed, she is possessed". I was like "what you on about she isn't possessed she is unwell". 

'I'm sure I grabbed somebody's phone and as I called them, Ellie stopped breathing.' 

He said of the suspect: 'He was not helping one bit. He was talking s***. 

'When she stopped breathing the ambulance was on the phone. I was pumping her chest. I already knew how to do CPR.

'As soon as the paramedics arrived I went. I didn't know that she was going to die. I knew that she wasn't well, she was fitting. 

'In my eyes I didn't do nothing but help out that night. I'm here for the justice to Ellie.'

He said had been 'scared' at the time to tell the ambulance operator on the phone that Ellie had taken drugs adding, 'why would I when I'm a kid and scared of saying stuff like that on the phone'. 

He said: 'It's drugs isn't it plus I was only 15 at the time, plus I was drunk, plus we were all mates at the time. At the time maybe I didn't want anyone to get to trouble and I was scared.'

He later admitted not telling police how Ellie got the drugs but said: 'It was because I didn't want to get anyone into trouble. 

'I was 15 at the time. All them were older than me. I didn't have a clue. I hadn't been in that position.'

Prosecutor Miss Wendy Newton said: 'The defendant was dishing out this drug, wrap an amount in a cigarette paper and swallow it whole known as a bomb several times. 

'He was offering the drug to Ellie who took several of these bombs.

'Over the course of the evening Ellie Jones and the defendant are described as looking increasingly intoxicated. 

'In particular, Ellie was stumbling and swaying and she felt sick. She was sitting on the floor and may have vomited.

'It is accepted the defendant went to bed before everyone and that Ellie 's condition is then described as deteriorating over the next few hours and she is helped to bed. 

'She was described as shaking and restless, that she was hot and sweaty and he couldn't understand what she was saying.'

The ambulance took Ellie to Warrington Hospital at 3.30am but she died shortly before 5am.

Tests showed she had PMA in her blood was 'within the range associated with fatalities from the drug'. A vodka bottle seized at the scene was found to contain alcohol and PMA.

The defendant was one of three teenage boys arrested over the tragedy. He denies supplying Class A drugs. The trial continues.
