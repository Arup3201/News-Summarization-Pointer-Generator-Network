Serial killer Joanna Dennehy told a cell mate she would become 'famous' for her crimes two years before her murder spree, it was claimed today.

While in prison, the 31-year-old, who is due to be sentenced for three murders next week, told a former inmate in 2011 she was plotting the killings.

Dennehy went on to carry out a 13-day stabbing spree which left three men dead and two others wounded.

The former friend, who did not want to be named, told the Sunday MIrror: 'Jo was cocky and people were wary of her. Her reputation was that she was a nutter, one of the hardest people in the prison.

'She
 mentioned to me once that she liked stabbing people but I just brushed 
it off. Then she talked about writing a book and said, "I'm going to 
kill all these people, I'm going to be famous".'

The prisoners were locked up together for three months at Peterborough prison in Cambridgeshire while Dennehy was accused of two earlier stabbings.

Dennehy's launched her killing spree last March.

The bodies of Dennehy's victims - Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee and John Chapman - were found in March and April last year.

After
 the killings, Dennehy and her accomplice Gary Stretch drove from Peterborough to Hereford
 where she selected two other men - Robin Bereza and John Rogers - at 
random.

She repeatedly stabbed the dog walkers in the street but both survived.Â

Stretch was found guilty of three 
counts of preventing the lawful burial of a body and one of attempted 
murder at Cambridge Crown Court.

Leslie Layton was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice.

During
 the trial, prosecutors said Dennehy 'cast a spell' over her alleged 
accomplices and some of her victims as she killed 'for fun'.

Dennehy was likened to 'Uma Thurman 
from Kill Bill and the woman from the Terminator' by married 
father-of-two Mr Lee shortly before his death.

Mr Chapman had dubbed her the 'man woman' because of her intimidating nature.

At
 the height of a nationwide man-hunt, she bragged to one witness that 
she had killed eight people - although no further murders have been 
detected.

All of the murder victims died from multiple stab injuries, including wounds to the heart.

Dennehy,
 from Peterborough, has already pleaded guilty to murder as well as 
preventing the lawful and decent burial of all three victims and two 
charges of attempted murder.

She is currently awaiting sentencing along with Robert Moore, 55, who has admitted assisting an offender.
