Former Sunderland boss Paolo Di Canio has hit out at owner Ellis Short by insisting that he and not  Gus Poyet is to blame for the club’s sorry state.

The controversial Italian was sacked just six games into the 2013-14 campaign despite saving the Black Cats from relegation the previous season.

Poyet, too, has now been axed by Short after Saturday’s 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa left them one place and one point above the drop zone.

But Di Canio came out in support of his successor, claiming that billionaire American Short is responsible for Sunderland’s current plight.

‘It’s not Poyet’s fault because chairman Ellis Short is the real origin of all these troubles,’ Di Canio told Fox Sports.

‘I saved Sunderland when the club was sinking, along with my staff. I completed a true miracle, on and off the pitch.

‘We tried to change the philosophy of the team. In the two previous years, no fines were given, despite players getting drunk and partying until late, even a few days before a match.

‘I was giving fines even for (players being) five minutes late.

‘It’s fundamental, to keep order in the dressing room. I took all the responsibilities, but my project was immediately cut off.

‘It was a choice which came from above. When I was the manager, two directors chose 16 players.

‘None of them are still at the club - neither the players, nor those directors.'

However, Di Canio believes Poyet should have done more to deal with ill-discipline in the squad and says supporters would never have streamed for the exits under his charge, as they did during the weekend loss to Villa.

‘I don’t want to blame Poyet, but if you’re afraid to fine one of your players, then you have to expect some troubles,' he added. 'This team is just looking for three worse teams to leave behind.

'When I was their manager, it never happened to see the supporters leaving the stadium before the final whistle.

'This never happened because we always played with dignity, regardless of the bad results. I don't know what's happening now, but it looks like the team is drifting.
