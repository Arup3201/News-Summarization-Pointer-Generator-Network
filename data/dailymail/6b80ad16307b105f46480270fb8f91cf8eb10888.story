A British woman could be jailed for up to ten years over claims that she was a key figure in a Mafia drug-smuggling operation run from a Spanish holiday resort.

Sheryl Rogers, 46, was the mistress of a Mafia boss who ran the £100million business for one of Italy’s most dangerous criminal families.

The grandmother of three spent years as the lover of Giuseppe Felaco, a senior member of the Nuvoletta family.

Horse-loving Sheryl Rogers is accused of helping her former lover run a multi-million pound crime organisation

Rogers, from Box Hill, Surrey, is accused of helping to launder hundreds of millions of pounds in profits from the smuggling of up to six tons of cannabis from Morocco to Italy every month.

The horse-lover was arrested three years ago in a raid at Felaco’s holiday complex in Tenerife. She spent five months in prison before being released on bail, and recently became engaged to Stephen Hill, a handyman from Middlesbrough who lives on the island.

Felaco died at 57 from cancer shortly after he was arrested in 2011 as police seized assets worth £32million, including super-cars, luxury properties and a yacht. His lover of 16 years is due to go on trial in months with 20 other alleged members of the Nuvoletta family.

In a writ at the Central Criminal Court in Madrid, prosecutors claim that Rogers ‘participated actively in financial operations’ to conceal criminal money.

But she claims Felaco, with whom she has a 16-year-old son, told her that he was a legitimate businessman.

He said he bought the 200-apartment Marina Palace resort in Adeje in Tenerife for £3.2million in 1999 with a bank loan. But police claim he built the complex in the Nineties and installed henchmen to launder drugs profits.

At the weekend, Rogers, who met Felaco while running a bar in Tenerife, described the charges as ‘daft’ and said police had got ‘everything completely wrong’. She said she could not have been in the Mafia because she was not Italian and, besides, they did not admit female members.

‘I was basically a housewife,’ she said. ‘I did not have anything to do with the business. I was put down in the books as if I worked in his business but that was because we weren’t married and I had no social [security] and he wouldn’t let me work. 

'I still cannot believe the Mafia accusation, but then perhaps I did not know him at all, and that is very scary.

‘I still do not know if he actually loved me or just used me. Now he is dead I will never know.’ Rogers moved to Tenerife in 1994 to open a bar, and fell for the crime boss. She gave birth to his son, Joseph Felaco, in October 1997.

Felaco – known as Peppe Nazzaro – was originally a member of another Neapolitan Mafia family when he married Maria Michelino, from the Nuvoletta clan. Rogers claimed that Felaco’s wife knew all about her and that their children even became friends.

Rogers recently became engaged to Hill (pictured together) who works on the island as a handyman 

The Nuvoletta family control a network of international business interests, from cement manufacturing to hotel cleaning.

Felaco built up an extraordinary empire, including an Italian holiday home on Lake Como near George Clooney’s mansion.

Rogers and her co-defendants face a ten-year prison sentence and fines of up to £2.4million each over charges of money laundering and illicit association.

She said that after her arrest she was held as a high-risk prisoner and could have no visitors, so she only learned of her lover’s death from another inmate.

Rogers accused police of rushing the inquiry. She said: ‘They hadn’t finished their investigation when they arrested all the people. The main man, Giuseppe, was dying, so they made a mass of arrests. A lot of people in this case have absolutely nothing to do with anything.’
