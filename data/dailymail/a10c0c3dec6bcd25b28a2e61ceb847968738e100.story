As one of Hollywood's most stylish young stars, Jessica Alba is rarely snapped wearing the same item twice.

But even fashion icons have their trusty staples, and it seems these colourful cat-eye sunglasses are fast becoming the actress' favourite pair.

The 32-year-old mother-of-two slipped on the shades as she left a New York hotel yesterday to catch a flight back to Los Angeles, the day after she was spotted wearing them on a stroll around Manhattan with husband Cash Warren.

Homeward bound: Heading back to LA after a weekend in New York, the actress had comfortable yet stylish in-flight attire nailed

Alba had stylish yet comfortable in-flight attire nailed, teaming loose fitting green trousers with a black and grey top, black cardigan, and flat black pumps.

She wore her long, highlighted hair loose and pinned back from her face.

And the star, who was in the city with her husband to attend the wedding of fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez and his partner Thomas, looked just as immaculate as she touched down in Los Angeles after her flight.

Alba was spotted checking her mobile phone as she waited for her ride outside the airport.

The actress did look slightly glum as she scrolled through her phone while waiting to be picked up - suggesting even A-listers experience post-holiday blues.

Alba had enjoyed a decadent brunch with husband Cash the previous day, followed by a chocolate ice cream cone as the couple strolled around New York in the sunshine.

The actress looked suitably summery in a strapless blue-and-green patterned dress as she and Cash, 34, enjoyed their post-brunch walk.

Jessica wore a burnt orange cardigan and blue flip flops, and accessorised with a royal blue handbag.

Her trusty sunglasses added a retro touch, and she pulled her highlighted brown hair into a high ponytail.

Cash, meanwhile, looked smart in a white shirt and khaki shorts, adding a trendy touch with cream Converse trainers.

Jessica posted an Instagram picture earlier showing a delicious frittata on her plate as she and Cash dined out for brunch.

And the previous evening, she uploaded more food and wine pictures, suggesting that she doesn't follow a strict diet.

Jessica recently returned from Colorado where she was filming her upcoming feature Dear Eleanor.

Dear Eleanor is set in 1962 and centres around two best friends, played by Liana Liberato and Isabelle Fuhrman, who embark on a search for Eleanor Roosevelt during the chaos of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Kevin Connolly, who is most known for his role as Eric on HBO's Entourage, is directing the film.
