Weathered and war-weary, these are the Dad's Army warriors fighting to free a country for which many have fought before.

They are the  Kurdish volunteers on the battlefield of Iraq's bloody war against the  Islamic State jihadis ravaging their homeland. 

And while many look like they'd better belong in line for a free bus pass than on the frontline, their advancing years belie their bravery.

The group of Kurdish volunteers pose with their rusty AK47s  from previous wars in handed-down uniforms 

I meet them in the Iraqi town of Taza Kharmatho, just south of Kirkuk city, where war is raging. 

Dressed proudly in handed-down uniforms, they yield weapons leftover from bygone wars, including AK47s dating from the 1960s.

One day, alongside a tank, Russian grenade launcher and a handful of machine guns, these were all they had to fight with.  

By contrast, the ISIS fighters are armed  with state-of-the-art weaponry stolen from the Iraqi army or seized from wayward U.S. airdrops meant for Peshmerga Kurds.

Where these seasoned soldiers negotiate the muddy roads (we saw heavy rain for five days here) in four-wheel-drives, ISIS have hummers.

Nevertheless, they have no choice but to fight with what they have - despite hollow promises from the U.S. and Europe to arm them adequately.

One, who did not want to give his name but has returned to Iraq from London where he has lived for many years, told me his AK47 is indeed from the 1960s.

'My weapon is an AK47 that I saved up my own money for and bought on the black market to fight ISIS to save my country,' he tells me proudly, holding his rattling rifle with both hands. 

General Jamal is among the men lost one of their eyes during the Persin Gulf War. Undeterred by the bloody conflict in the 80s, he has taken up arms to defend his native Iraq 

The group's repertoire of weapons include rusty AK47s from the 1960s including this one, bought by a fighter on the black market  

Dressed proudly in handed down uniforms from by-gone wars, the fighters said they desperately need modern guns in order to go up against ISIS jihadis 

Many of the men are grandfathers determined not to stand idly by as their country is ravaged by terrorists 

'Of course we want better guns but we have no choice.

'Yes, we desperately need modern guns, any type would be better than this. It's no different to you using needing a new car, PC or laptop. 

'Technology has changed so we have to be like all other countries that have proper armies with everything new and modern weapons.'

He is very clear as to where the new weapons should come from. 'They should come from the countries that created this situation; the countries that brought their armies to Iraq then left. 

'But if any countries will send us weapons it would be greatly appreciated.'

On the resources held by ISIS, he says: 'They have good weapons from the United States as well as all the weapons which Nouri al-Maliki gave them. 

'Their weapons are much stronger than ours - there is such a huge difference ... but we can still beat them.'

Many of the men bare  scars of  the bloody First Persian Gulf War of the mid-1980s, when they fought with Iran against forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.

Some  left after that war, emigrating to Europe in search of a better life for their families.

But amid a new threat to their homeland, they have returned in their droves to fight.

Wearing sweaters, shirts and lace-up shoes, the unlikely army has managed to fend off advances from ISIS on some of the region's roads 

In makeshift accommodation near the frontline the men gear up for another day of fighting in mismatching uniforms

The men stand in makeshift uniforms looking out across the Taza frontline with their rusty weapons by their side 

Despite their advancing age and rusty resources, the small army of vigilantes has been able to defeat ISIS in small victories, such as taking back control of a seized road 

A rusty grenade and a water pouch rest on a man's belt made from a scarf, his rifle tucked under his arm 

An elderly fighter rests his gun on a make-shift look out point in the desert in Taza, Iraq, where ISIS have been storming towns and ravaging villages 

Many of the men fled the Middle East in the 1980s for Europe in search of a better life for their families but have returned amid the threat of ISIS 

Cleaning their rusty rifles, two Kurdish fighters sit cross-legged on the Taza front preparing for yet more conflict

Many of the men bear scars from the Persian Gulf War in which they fought alongside Iran against forces loyal to Saddam Hussein

While older fighters lead the dysfunctional army, youngsters have followed by example, many wishing to be like their fathers and grandfathers as men 

Most of the weapons used by the group have been bought on the black market collected from previous wars

A few machine guns lined up to overlook the Taza front are among the group's only weaponry 

The group prepares a meal together in their accommodation on the Taza frontline still dressed in their uniforms

Bulletproof vests are among the rare items which resemble modern army uniforms worn by the group 

With their weapons cast off nearby the men pray behind closed doors before re-entering the frontline. Right, a fighter climbs atop their only tank 

I am shocked at how many of the men have only one eye - the others, many tell me,  were blown from their sockets by malfunctioning, poorly-made mortar's of that First Persian Gulf War.

Some tell me I am the only journalist they have seen here in months. Others say I am the first one they have ever seen.

Last week, they lost the road to ISIS Chechens, but retook it a few days later, killing three enemy fighters.

Moving about is difficult here too. The roads are littered with hidden mines, left by retreating ISIS fighters who are paying local farmers to booby-trap their land.   

Yet this is a position of key strategic significance; just 500 metres to the south, I can see ISIS flags with my bare eyes. 

Some of the group haven't seen a journalist in the area for months, while others claim none have been at all 

With the Kurdish flag flying proudly the men lookout from their position atop a hill in Taza Kharmatho

While ISIS operates in hummers, the small group have no choice but to navigate the treacherous roads in 4x4s

A young boy stands on the army's only tank behind a wall of dirt and dust on the frontline 

Soldering on: One of the men poses with a youngster proudly toting a gun. Despite their poor resources and ill-fitting uniforms, the army is made up of the bravest fighters seen for miles 

Hope: A Kurdish flag waves from the back of one of the group's few vehicles despite the region's roads being compromised by ISIS fighters

I don't even need binoculars to see smoke rising from their kitchens or the black shapes of men running from house to house.

The Kurds however are not frightened by such proximity.  For them death is part of their natural fate. 

They accept it will happen to them sooner or later - if not tomorrow then next week, next year or in a decade's time.  

When it was time for me to go back in Erbil, the Kurdish capital in Northern Iraq, they drove me along one of the most dangerous roads in the area after hearing the usual route was cut off. 

Even if they look like an army from another century, they are some of the bravest men I have ever met; they will defend their country to the end.
