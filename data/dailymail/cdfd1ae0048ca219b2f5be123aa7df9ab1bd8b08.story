Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is expected to miss the remainder of the season with a torn rotator cuff.

Bryant sustained the injury during the second half of a 96-80 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night in New Orleans. Sources told ESPN that he has been dealing with this shoulder injury since the preseason.

The Lakers announced on Thursday that the findings were the result of a preliminary MRI taken in San Antonio.

On Friday, the team said the initial diagnosis was confirmed after another examination and Bryant was discussing options with doctors. He is scheduled to be examined by Dr. Neal ElAttrache on Monday, and a decision about surgery is expected to be made then.

The 36-year-old Bryant has played in 35 games this season since returning from an Achilles injury that sidelined him last year. He is averaging 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists for the Lakers, who are in last place in the Pacific Division with a 12-31 record.
