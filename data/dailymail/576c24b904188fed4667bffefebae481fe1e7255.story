Fulham have made moves to sign Mark Hudson and Matt Smith from Championshp rivals Cardiff and Leeds. 

Manager Felix Magath is keen to strengthen his squad before the close of the transfer window after a disastrous start to life in the second tier. 

The Cottagers find themselves second from bottom on just one point after drawing 1-1 with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men on Saturday, having lost their opening four fixtures.

Hudson played no part in the Bluebirds' draw at Craven Cottage and Magath is hopeful of adding the experienced central defender to his ranks. 

The German also wants to bring giant striker Smith to west London from Leeds as he looks reunite the 25-year-old with Ross McCormack, who left Elland Road for £11million earlier this summer. 

Smith was an unused substitute as United beat Bolton 1-0 at home on Saturday afternoon.
