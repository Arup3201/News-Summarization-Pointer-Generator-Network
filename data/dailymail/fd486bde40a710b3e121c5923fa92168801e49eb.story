Alan Pardew wants wingers Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie to become the 21st century version of Ian Wright and Mark Bright at Crystal Palace.

The pair terrorised QPR last week in the 3-1 win with Zaha scoring from a Bolasie cross and Pardew is excited by the potential his two wingers have attacking both flanks.

But the Palace boss has warned the pair are not the finished article and still have plenty of room for improvement.

Yannick Bolasie was in magnificent form last Saturday as Crystal Palace beat QPR 3-1 at Selhurst Park

He said: ‘I think any team knows that any full backs coming up against these two know they are in for a test because these two can move the ball.

‘They have to do the other parts of the game that don’t come as easy to them such as, discipline, work rate, commitment, aggression, but they are adding those aspects to their games and at the moment they have got the flare in them to create something.

‘It is exciting to watch them and it is exciting to have them in the team - but frightening for the opposing manager.’

Pardew was a player at Palace in the late 1980s and early 90s when Wright and Bright formed one of the most lethal strike partnerships in English football.

They scored a total of 209 goals between them and guided Palace to promotion to the top flight in 1989 and then to a third place finish in the old Division One under Steve Coppell in 1991.

And Pardew says the game has changed so much with more focus being put on the midfield that the sort of partnership that Wright and Bright had is unlikely ever to be seen again – but Zaha and Bolasie can provide a new type of threat.

He added: ‘Mark Bright and Ian Wright had a very tight bond and that helped them with each others games.

‘They were very unselfish, although Brighty will probably argue that Ian was more selfish than him.

‘What they had was the chemistry of the old front pair. Those days are sadly diminishing because of the power of the midfield of the top teams and if you don't match that up it is very difficult to win games so that kind of combination is not a popular in the Premier League as it used to be.

‘The style you have with Zaha and Bolasie out wide it can provide a nice force for us and we have a very experienced striker in Glenn Murray who is looking to profit and that is their job, to put balls in the box.’

Palace travel to Stoke on Saturday and have put on free coach travel for fans making the trip.

The Eagles have sold out their allocation of 2,900 tickets and Pardew hopes the traveling fans will be able to make themselves heard at a traditionally noisy Britannia Stadium.

Despite being eight points clear of the bottom three, Pardew does not want anyone at the club to become complacent.

He added: ‘We just hope they make a lot of noise, we'll need them, we cannot afford to relax, the second year in the top flight is always more difficult after you have survived a promotion year.

‘We know it is going to be tight to stay up again, but there is an extra air of confidence in the club after our recent wins, but seven days is a long time in football and we still have work to do.’

Pardew will check on the fitness of Zaha and Jason Puncheon ahead of Saturday's trip to Stoke after both picked up knocks against QPR last weekend.
