Brighton & Hove Albion are poised to sack Sami Hyypia after their dreadful start to the season.

The Seagulls are in the bottom three, collecting just three league wins all season.

And Hyypia, 41, is set to pay the price for their poor form, with the club already looking at potential replacements.

Games: 25 (including League Cup)

Wins: 6 

Draws: 9

Losses: 10 

Win %: 24 

The former Liverpool hero is clinging on to his job this morning - but it is understood a decision on his future could be made within the next 24 hours.

Ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager Tim Sherwood will head Brighton's hitlist if Hyypia is removed - but he is understood to have reservations about the role.

Tony Pulis is also wanted, but it is unclear whether the former Stoke City and Crystal Palace boss would drop down a division.

Gianfranco Zola, Brian McDermott and Chris Hughton could also enter the frame.
