The mystery donor who has been dropping envelopes stuffed with cash around San Francisco has been caught on camera for the first time as he expands his generosity to Los Angeles.

But the man behind the Twitter handle 'HiddenCash' refused to reveal his identity and would only show his feet as he chatted with CBS2 after dropping off the money on Wednesday night.

Before the interview, it was not even known if the anonymous donor was male or female.

'Initially this was just a small, local 
San Francisco story and it’s just gone global worldwide,' he said.

Mystery: The man known only as 'Hidden Cash' chatted for an interview - but wouldn't reveal his identity

'So it's great 
timing that I'm gonna be in LA for the next three days and I want to do 
some drops here and get the city excited about finding money and just 
the idea about giving back.'

He has been posting clues about where he has hidden the money on his Twitter page, where he has more than 273,000 followers - hundreds of thousands more than he had just a few days ago.

Each cryptic clue has sent local residents into a flutter, but scores of people have now walked away with $100 bills.

In Los Angeles, Ken Dellinger was the first LA resident to strike it rich with $250 in cash. Taking lead from the mystery donor, he gave $50 away and had plans to give away more, he told CBS.

'I just happened to look on Twitter a 
few minutes ago cause I remembered it was going to be happening this 
weekend and I saw something about the fountain and I live just up 
the block,' he said, grinning. 'It was awesome.'

Hidden Cash said he would hide more money in Los Angeles on Thursday before returning home.

Earlier this week, he revealed that he had made his fortune through real estate and had simply wanted to share his wealth in a fun way.

'I just closed a real estate deal where my profit was about 
half-a-million dollars,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'I decided even before it closed that one of 
the things I wanted to do with the money was something fun in SF.'

HiddenCash 
said they toyed with challenges for people to earn the money, but after 
all the ideas seemed too complicated, they opted for the simple cash 
stash.

'I
 just hope some rich one-percenter like me doesn't find it and keep it,'
 HiddenCash said. 'In no way is this meant to be instead of charity. I 
also donate generously to charity.'

He said that he has no plans to stop any time soon and hopes to expand it to other cities beyond San Francisco and Los Angeles.

But he said he wishes to stay anonymous because some people who know him might not be happy that he is giving money away.

HiddenCash
 has so far made cash dumps around San Francisco's Mission District and 
through the Richmond District, among others. Amounts at
 the drop spots have varied.

The tweeter, 
who calls the program 'an anonymous social experiment for good,' leaves 
hints by sharing a photo of the drop-off spot, as well as written clue.

'Could
 you and 25 of your friends use a @Sightglass Coffee? Look in the 
abandoned phonebox next door,' one tweet said, along with a photo of a 
$100 bill.

'New drop: look under me :)' said another, which appeared to show a park bench. 

The Twitter accounts followers have now reached more than 20,000 as residents desperately try to get their hands on the cash.

And the lucky ones have been tweeting pictures of their newfound riches.

'YESSSSSS,' wrote one winner, who found the cash on Ocean Beach. 'Had to race another searcher but I WON.'

The donor also contacted The Bold Italic and said he or she will leave money 'once or twice a week'.

'This
 is my way of giving back to the community and also having fun,' they 
said. 'The bigger idea is just to give back, both financially and a 
sense of fun to the community that has made me wealthy.'
