A family has spoken of their shock after a father-and-son's birthday treat in a £150,000 hired super-car ended in tragedy as it hurtled off a runway at 100mph ending up on its roof in a garden leaving the driver critically injured.

Father-of-four Graham Padmore, 58, is fighting for 
his life after he lost control of the Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder at 
Woodford aerodrome in Cheshire.

His
disabled son Mark, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, was a 
passenger in the car but escaped with minor injuries after being pulled 
from the wreckage.

Accident: Graham Padmore and his disabled son Mark who were in Lamborghini crash. Mr Padmore suffered serious head and chest injuries and fighting for his life in hospital

Mangled: The £150,000 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder ended up in a garden after hurtling off a runway at 100mph

Mr Padmore was flung from the car and suffered serious head and chest injuries.

In a statement, the Padmore family said the drive was intended as a once-in-a-lifetime treat for Mark, who has cerebral palsy. 

'It was the first run at the aerodrome
and Graham was driving in a straight line, not round and round when he 
crashed,' they said.

'We have not had any details back yet 
about the car. Graham is a sensible family man who is very safety 
conscious and would never do anything to put himself or Mark in danger.

'Sadly, this was a birthday treat 
which has gone tragically wrong. We would like to thank the staff at the
aerodrome who risked their lives to drag Mark from the car, all the 
emergency services and the staff at Wythenshawe Hospital.

'Our main priority now is to concentrate on hoping for our dad’s recovery.'

Mr Padmore, who was also celebrating his birthday, had hired the car, which has a top speed of 200mph, as a treat.

The pair had been given special permission to use the runway by the owners of the site, Avro Heritage.

A Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, like the one Mr Padmore crashed

The
crash happened on Monday at the western end of the airfield, with the 
Lamborghini smashing through two fences and a ditch before ending up on 
its roof in the garden of a large farmhouse.

Graham's wife Georgina and daughters Helen, 28, and Claire, 30, were watching, it is believed.

Adam
Jones, 37, a birdwatcher from Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, who 
witnessed the aftermath, said: 'There were a dozen police cars on the 
airfield which, considering it has been closed for a year, I thought was
a bit strange.

'I got out of my car and in the garden was an up-turned Lamborghini with about half-a-dozen police officers standing near it.

'I’m surprised anyone got out of that car because it was so badly mangled and upside down.

'It seemed to have jumped over a ditch and into the back garden.

'To be honest, I assumed it had been a high-speed chase. Now it turns out it wasn’t like that. It was a tragic accident.'

Graham is being treated for severe chest and head injuries at Wythenshawe hospital.

The Lamborghini left the road towards the western end of the runway, flipping over a ditch and two fences to land in a garden

A
neighbour told the Sun: 'Graham is a sensible driver and didn't want to
break the speed limit on public roads so he tried to organise doing it 
as safely as possible.

'He wanted to treat his son. They were driving it all weekend and were having a fantastic time.'

Avro Heritage spokesman James Fletcher said their thoughts were with the family of the two men. He said: 'I can confirm that there were no other vehicles involved.'

It is understood the pair were allowed to use the runway for free at their own risk.

Sergeant
Danny Byrne from Greater Manchester Police's Serious Collision 
Investigation Unit, said: 'We believe the vehicle was being driven at a 
high speed and it is likely the driver may have lost control.

'Members of the injured man's family are being comforted by specially trained officers at this difficult time.'

A
spokesman for the police force said: 'Officers were called to an 
airfield on Chester Road, Stockport following reports a hired sports car
had been involved in a collision.

'On
arrival, it was discovered that a Lamborghini was upside down in the 
garden of a nearby house. No other vehicles were involved.

'A 58-year old man, the driver, was taken to hospital where his condition is described as critical. A 21-year-old man suffered minor bruising and has been discharged.'
