The Prince of Wales got a little closer to nature than he bargained for when the heavens opened as he toured a park in the centre of a London housing estate this morning.

Despite the downpour, the royal, who took shelter under a large black umbrella, was on jolly form and smiled broadly as he chatted to locals. 

As he toured Arlington Gardens, the centrepiece of the Packington Estate in London's Islington, Charles was also introduced to a young well-wisher, one-year-old Louis Egerton-Smith - much to the Prince's delight.

Charles was at the Packington Estate  to get a closer look at a regeneration project run by apprentices funded by The Prince's Trust.

The programme, called Get Into Construction, is a short intensive course for young unemployed people who want to work in building and aims to give them the confidence and skills they need for success.

As well as classroom time, teenagers and young adults taking part are sent out on placements, one of which is at the Packington Estate regeneration site. 

Built in the 1960s, the Packington Estate is currently being redeveloped by the Hyde Group who are replacing the old housing blocks and improving the communal areas, among them Arlington Gardens.

Now seven years into the project, 435 new homes have been built, including a mixture of modern apartments along the Regent’s Canal and a terrace of elegant, classing Islington Town houses.

But while Charles has long taken an interest in the built environment, it was meeting the apprentices sponsored by the Prince's Trust that appeared to give him the most pleasure.

Charles, who is fresh from a successful tour of Mexico and Colombia, was in his element as he chatted to the apprentices, and became animated as they discussed planting.

While Charles was getting wet in Islington, the Queen was busy at Buckingham Palace where she held audiences for two new ambassadors.

Resplendent in an elegant salmon pink dress, Her Majesty was all smiles as she greeted His Excellency Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Aminuddin Ihsan, Brunei's new High Commissioner.

Major General Ihsan was followed by  Jules-Armand Aniambossou, the new Ambassador from the Republic of Benin.

Elegant: The Queen looked wonderful in a salmon pink ensemble teamed with a delicate pearl necklace

Chat: The new ambassador appeared to enjoy his meeting with Her Majesty and chatted happily

Important: Every new ambassador must present the Queen with his credentials on arrival in the UK
