Jordon Ibe is poised to sign a new five-year contract with Liverpool by the end of the week.

The 19-year-old has agreed terms on a deal which will keep him at Anfield until 2020.

Ibe spent the first half of this season on loan at Derby County but returned to Liverpool in January and has made a notable impact in his eight appearances.

A knee injury disrupted his run in the side and he was cup-tied for Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final defeat to Aston Villa, but he is expected to return against West Brom this weekend.

Liverpool also expect to announce Jordan Henderson's new contract this week and are close to finalising an extension for Martin Skrtel.

Talks are ongoing with young defender Jon Flanagan too whose contract expires in June.

Liverpool yesterday agreed a new three-year shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered worth around £30million a year.
