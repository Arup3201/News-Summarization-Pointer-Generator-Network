Australian actress Cate Blanchett says women are subjected to unfair judgment when it comes to balancing work and motherhood because of stereotypes that are 'complete rubbish'.

The 45-year-old Australian actress and mum-of-three spoke out about the 'raft of judgement' levelled at women who play mothers on screen, while promoting her new film How To Train Your Dragon 2 in Cannes.

The award winning beauty criticised how she was always asked about her ability to maintain a balance between working on high profile films and looking after her three sons.

'It's a certainly a question that's never asked of men. The question is only ever directed towards of women,' the actress said according to the Telegraph UK.

Award winning actress and mother: Cate Blanchett stuns the crowd at the Cannes Festival on Friday and speaks out about the stereotypes imposed on working mothers in the industry

Cate stars as a mother in her new film who is reunited with her son after abandoning him earlier on and she explained that the scrutiny that she faces off camera transcends to her onscreen performance.

'When anyone plays a mother on film, there is a whole raft of judgment in that a mother is a particular archetype or that every mother is the same,’ the actress said.

‘That's complete rubbish,’ she continued, adding that the film touched on this issue ‘beautifully and deeply’, serving the storyline well.

Cate and her husband of 16 years, screenwriter and playwright Andrew Upton, 48, have three sons, Dashiell, 12, Roman, 10, and Ignatius, six.

The Blue Jasmine actress also expressed her frustration at how such a focus on women was still existent in 2014.

Emphasising the fact that women are still paid less in practically every industry, the blonde beauty said she was appalled that the current situation made her feel like she was back in the Middle Ages.

‘I’m an actress at a film festival. I can cope with the questions, I'm a big girl.  But it does surprise me that we're still asking those questions,’ she said.

And it looks like the international star was disgruntled about the attention placed on women beyond their motherly personas.

She admitted that she finds it a ‘little bit rude’ when actresses like herself are scrutinised for their red carpet attire.

Cate had Hollywood talking during the Screen Actors Guild Awards earlier this year, when she shunned a camera man for scanning the camera lens up and down to capture all angles of her exquisite body.

But she said that the Cannes film festival is a bit more of an exception, as grand fashion is in essence a part of the event.
