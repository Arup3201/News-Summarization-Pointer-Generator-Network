Lord Tebbit has urged tactical voters to back the UK Independence Party in tomorrow’s local elections.

In an extraordinary intervention, the 
Tory grandee said UKIP’s policies were now those ‘closest to a 
traditional Conservative agenda’. And
 he urged Right-leaning voters in Labour areas to vote tactically for 
whichever candidate had the best chance of causing an upset – even if 
they are not Conservative.

Amid growing signs that the Tories could haemorrhage support to UKIP, David Cameron signalled an end to personal attacks on his rivals, insisting: 'I'm not calling anybody anything.'

The parties go into battle in 34 councils in tomorrow's elections, with the Tories braced for big losses in areas last contested in 2009 when Gordon Brown was leading Labour to a major defeat. But all eyes will be on what impact UKIP can make, and how many votes it can take from the bigger parties

Pollsters predict UKIP could win between 40 and 100 seats when voters got to polls in 34 councils in England and Wales.

Nigel Farage's anti-EU party is fielding almost as many candidates as the Lib Dems, and is confident of coming at least third in the overall share of the vote.

One poll of areas where elections are being held on Thursday put UKIP on 22 per cent, well ahead of the Lib Dems on 12 per cent and only just behind Labour on 24 per cent. The Conservatives were in first on 31 per cent, but Tory strategists fear their recent attacks on UKIP could backfire and see more voters switch to back Mr Farage.

Lord Tebbit, who has been warned by 
David Cameron against making pro-UKIP remarks – said he would vote 
Conservative because he supported his local Tory council.

But,
 in comments on a newspaper blog that could result in disciplinary 
action, he added: ‘If you have a Labour councillor then I suggest that 
the best vote is the one most likely to replace him or her with either a
 Conservative, UKIP or sound independent one.’

UKIP has been under sustained assault from the Tories, with Kenneth Clarke branding the party a ‘collection of clowns’ supported by 'racists'.

And
 Tory sources believe the anti-EU party could do serious damage tomorrow
 with Conservatives potentially forced to go into coalition with UKIP 
councillors in once-safe Tory areas.

But
 Lord Tebbit said his party’s tactics were counterproductive and accused
 senior Tories, including Mr Clarke, of waging a ‘smear campaign’ 
against UKIP which could drive disaffected voters into the arms of the 
smaller party.

David Cameron has curbed criticism of UKIP in recent days amid fears the attacks could backfire and encourage more voters back the anti-EU party. Lord Tebbit (right) risks a rebuke from the Conservative leadership for his suggestion that tactical voters should support UKIP in some areas

Lord Tebbit added: ‘It may well be that many former Conservative voters are so fed up with the Cameron coalition that they will turn to UKIP as the party which comes closest to a traditional Conservative agenda, and a reasoned position on the European issue. One can hardly blame them for that.’ 

In 2009, Lord Tebbit urged a boycott of all three main parties – bringing a sharp rebuke from Mr Cameron, who suggested the peer could be kicked out of the party if he went further and actively backed UKIP.

Today Mr Cameron refused to be drawn into the row over UKIP being branded 'clowns' and 'racists'.

He told ITV's Daybreak: 'I’m not calling anybody anything, what I’m doing is talking about what the Conservatives offer at the local elections and in the end it’s people who will go and vote and people who will choose.'

He said he would not make predictions about the scale of Tory losses in tomorrow's elections. 'The Conservatives are defending more seats than anyone else, we control more councils than anyone else, so everyone’s having a shot at us.'

However, Foreign Secretary William Hague today defended Mr Clarke's criticism of UKIP. He told BBC Radio 4: ' I think when you look at the financial commitments you can see why a former chancellor thinks they have a clown-like aspect.'

He went on to insist votwers had to make a 'choice' between Labour and the Tories. ' Voting for a fringe party is opting out of that choice and wasting your vote' he added.

In recent days UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been forced on to the back foot over his party’s ‘very odd’ candidates – one was pictured apparently giving a Nazi salute.

Mr Farage acknowledged the photo of Somerset candidate Alex Wood did ‘not look very pretty’ – but insisted the party did its best to weed out extremists.

He said UKIP had a blanket ban on former BNP activists and had rejected a number of candidates who ‘seemed to be very, very odd’.

But he admitted the rapid growth of the party meant some undesirables had slipped through the net.

‘We have done what due diligence we 
can at branch level,’ he said. ‘If people seemed to be very, very odd we
 didn’t accept them but we have taken people on faith.

‘We
 don’t have the resources to trawl through absolutely everybody’s social
 media sites and that has led to one or two embarrassments.’

Mr
 Wood was suspended from the party yesterday pending a police 
investigation into a series of allegedly racist postings on his Facebook
 page.

In
 one picture he was photographed apparently making a Nazi salute. In 
another, he was pictured in front of a Union flag holding a dagger 
between his teeth.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage was questioned about his party's vetting of candidates during a campaign visit with Richard Elvin, right, in South Shields, Newcastle

Mr Wood yesterday strenuously denied making the comments, claiming his Facebook account had been hacked.

He
 said the words attributed to him were appalling, adding: ‘I am 
completely against the Nazi beliefs, I am a democratic libertarian.’

Mr
 Wood said the picture of him apparently making a salute had been taken 
as he reached out to grab a camera from a friend who had been ‘taking a 
photograph of me pretending to be a houseplant’.

The picture with the dagger was taken while he was getting ready for a fancy dress party, he said.

Candidate: Alex Wood giving the alleged Nazi salute

Mr Wood will continue as a candidate in the Blackmore Vale ward because the ballot paper has already been printed but he will be an independent if he is elected.

n There was further chaos in UKIP ranks last night as the father of a rising Tory star tried to withdraw his candidacy for the party just 90 minutes after it was announced.

Securing the support of Sushil Patel – a British Asian and parent of Right-wing MP Priti Patel – was a coup for the Eurosceptic party.

But shortly after yesterday’s announcement  that he was their candidate in the Bushey South ward of Hertfordshire County Council, Mr Patel told a journalist he had stood down.

It is understood he was unable to withdraw fully since his name was already on the ballot paper. Sources claimed he had a ‘wobble’ after Conservative central office was alerted to his candidacy.

A YouGov poll yesterday put UKIP on 14 per cent, ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 11 per cent.

Labour’s Ed Miliband is also under pressure to live up to his One Nation slogan by making big gains in the south of England.

The Tories have challenged Labour to win an extra 1,000 seats, although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely.

However, UKIP could be the big winner 
of the night with the party confident it can push the Lib Dems into 
fourth place in total votes cast. Tories fear they could lose 400 seats.

Conservative strategists point out that in 2009 the Tories were as far ahead in the polls as Labour are now.

In 2009, the Tories won 35 per cent of
 the vote with Labour under Gordon Brown 13 points behind on just 22 per
 cent, pushed into third behind the Lib Dems. Today opinion polls put 
Labour up to 10 points ahead of the Tories.

One Cabinet minister claimed based on a uniform swing Labour should gain 1,500 seats but 1,000 was more realistic.

Labour has sought to downplay expectations, predicting just 200 gains.

In 2009 it suffered catastrophic 
losses in areas where the party once dominated, including losing 28 of 
44 seats in Lancashire and 29 or 32 seats in Staffordshire.

Other councils where Labour is 
expected to make strong gains are all in the north of England, including
 Derbyshire, Durham, Nothumberland and Nottinghamshire.

Tories are braced for hundreds of losses after gaining control of seven councils and 244 seats in 2009.

Just a year before the general election which forced Mr Brown out of power, Labour lost of four councils and 291 seats.

After being humiliated by the UK 
Independence Party in the Eastleigh by-election, the Tories will seek to
 portray UKIP as being allies of Labour, warning a vote for any party 
other than Conservatives will lead to council tax rises.

Voters will be told that backing UKIP 
will allow Labour to gain control of councils and drive up bills. ‘If 
you want to put up your council tax, vote UKIP or Labour,’ will be a key
 message.

In total almost 10,000 people are standing for election to 2,449 seats.

A total of 12 Tories are already home 
and dry after being returned unopposed. However Conservatives have 
already lost a Surrey seat after failing to file nomination papers on 
time.
