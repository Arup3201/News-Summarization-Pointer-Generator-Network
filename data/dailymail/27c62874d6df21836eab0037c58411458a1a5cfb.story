Jonathan Trott has continued to show glimpses of his top form returning after making another century for Warwickshire at Nottinghamshire.

The Group B Royal London One-Day Cup clash at Trent Bridge saw the former England batsman top score with 108 for his side in the 50-over match.

Trott hit his 108 in 121 balls, with his 161 minutes at the crease containing 11 fours before being caught by Riki Wessels off Luke Fletcher's bowling.

Playing back into form: Jonathan Trott hit another century while at the crease for Warwickshire

The 33-year-old hasn't featured for England since returning home from the Ashes last winter with a stress-related illness and has spent the year trying to recover while working his way back into the game.

Trott scored his first century of the year last month with a 106 against Sussex, reaching the same total in a clash against Durham soon after.

His third century of the year, Trott's form is at least likely to catch the attention of England's selectors, with the Warwickshire star seeing his place in the international set-up at No 3 currently occupied by Gary Ballance.

The 33-year-old returned for Warwickshire against Sussex in April but a repeat of his symptoms led to the right-hander taking a further break from the game.
