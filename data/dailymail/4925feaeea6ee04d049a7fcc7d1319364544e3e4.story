While brands everywhere up their prices to cope with the recession, one company has done the opposite.

Clothing firm Omgfashion.co.uk has unveiled a 99p dress  - a long black maxi dress with silver detail that is a classic addition to the summer wardrobe.

Many will be excited by the budget offering. After all, there's no denying the dress is a bargain. But it would be wise to remember that such cut-price offerings are often clever marketing stunts to increase traffic - and sales - for a site.

The average shopper who visits the site to buy the dress will be faced with a £2.95 postage cost on top of the cost of the dress (taking the total to £3.94) - rising to £5.95 for next day delivery.

And most will find it hard to resist snapping up another item or two while they are logged on.

Bargain: The 99p summer maxi is a long black dress with plunging sweetheart neckline

What better way to make that postage 'worthwhile' than by buying a few more bits and pieces?

Still, with the rest of the items 
priced reasonably too, this is not going to stretch the purse-strings of
the budget-conscious fashionista too far.

The black full-length dress is a sensible summer buy: classic shape, loosely ruched at the waist with a plunging sweetheart neckline. Silver clasps gather the straps together.

Omgfashion.co.uk caused the web to go into meltdown last year with a similar offer: a 99p sequinned party dress unveiled prior to the Christmas office party season.

This time, the website will make 1,000 dresses available for sale on their website at midnight tonight.

'With the great success last year with the 99p party dress we have decided to repeat this offer with a maxi dress for the summer,' said spokeswoman Hayley Mellor.

Last October's party dress sale saw 300 dresses sell out in 15 minutes after more than 100,000 people visited the Omgfashion.co.uk website, causing it to crash under the heavy traffic.

The new 99p dress goes on sale at midnight tonight - and they're predicting a surge of sales
