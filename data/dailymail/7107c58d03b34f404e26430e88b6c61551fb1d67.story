At a South Carolina high school graduation, the valedictorian's speech began as planned but suddenly became a religious sermon in spite of his school district’s recent ban of prayers at school gatherings.

Roy Costner IV, the top graduate of Pickens County, South Carolina’s Liberty High School submitted one speech for approval prior to the recent ceremony, but ended up tearing it up before a shocked crowd and giving an altogether different address. But it wasn’t entirely impromptu.

'Obviously I didn't do my job well enough,' Costner said after telling the crowd his speech had been approved by faculty. 'We're going to have to use a different one. Who cares?'

Then he ripped his speech in two.

Imbued: Valedictorian Roy Costner tore up his speech and chose to address the crowd with the Lord's Prayer

‘Those that we look up to, they have 
helped carve and mold us into the young adults that we are today,’ he began again. ‘I’m so glad that both of my 
parents led me to the Lord at a young age. And I think most of you will 
understand when I say…’

Costner paused, threw caution to the wind and began reciting a speech his audience had likely heard before.

‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name…’

Costner’s approved convocation address suddenly sounded a whole lot like the Lord’s Prayer. Costner continued as the crowd’s initial spattering of applause became a roar:

‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’

Spirited: The crowd was shocked as Costner shredded his approved speech, but the shock soon turned to applause

‘You couldn't even hear him doing the prayer anymore because everybody was clapping and cheering,’ attendee Brian Hoover told KSBW.

But Costner pressed on, righteously pointing a finger in the air as he struggled to be heard over the crowd.

‘For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever…Amen.’

The teenager’s zeal may have stemmed from the school district’s new rule banning prayers that reference specific religion in gatherings including school board meetings and, presumably, graduations.

The rule has caused a stir in the southern jurisdiction, as it was widely perceived as a ‘ban on prayer in schools.’

Misconception? Costner went rogue, apparently as a reaction to new county rules barring 'sectarian' from school gatherings, a rule widely misconstrued as an explicit ban on prayer in the South Carolina county's schools

Pickens County School District superintendent Kelly Pew clarified the rule in a March blog post:

‘What I find unfortunate are the mistaken and false representations that the Board or the District want to “ban” prayer from our schools,’ she writes. ‘The difference between the Board taking unto itself an invocation that previously was given by invitation, and some sort of wholesale anti-religious campaign, is vast.’

Despite going rogue in the face of the county’s decision, Costner won’t be facing any disciplinary action.

According to a school publication, WYFF reports, Costner will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree at nearby Clemson University in the fall and wants to go on to be a ‘computer programmer overseas.’
