Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor has rubbished claims  he kicked his mum out of his house in Africa because he thought she was a witch and has told people to 'stop doing Juju' on him.

Adebayor's sister Maggie stated on Ghanaian radio station Peace FM that the Premier League striker is refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year.

His mother is reportedly having to sell 'polythene bags, padlocks and other things' in order to provide for her family.

Juju is a word used in West Africa to refer to spells used as part of witchcraft. Juju is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of African tradition.

However the £101,000-a-week star has refuted suggestions he has decided to abandon his own mother.

Adebayor, speaking to Peace FM, said: 'I never sacked my mum from the house. She decided to leave the house.

'How am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward, so I will just be on my side and do my thing.

'They should stop talking, they should stop doing Juju on me, they should leave me alone.

'I bought a $1.2m house in East Legon for the one talking and calling herself my sister. Can you imagine that sister went to rent the house without my knowledge?'

It remains unclear who he was directing his request for people to 'stop doing Juju on him' at.

Adebayor will be hoping to focus his attention back on football this weekend when Tottenham take on Hull.
