A group of travellers have won the right to stay on land under a motorway flyover - with new toilets installed at taxpayers’ expense.

Council officials had tried to evict the travellers, but were beaten by a court injunction.

The O’Brien family pitched up on the site near the M5 six weeks ago after they were apparently turfed off a nearby council-run site when their tenancy ended.

Legal victory: A group of travellers has won the right to stay on land under a flyover on the M5, with portable toilets installed at taxpayers' expense

Bristol City Council applied for an eviction order but the travellers - who say they have nowhere to go - had already got an injunction blocking the order.

Last week the council’s High Court bid to get the injunction removed was dismissed.

Now bosses have been forced to install portaloos at the site in Shirehampton, Bristol, after locals threatened to collect excrement in the area and take it to local politicians’ homes.

The call for loos at the site under the M5 motorway came from Steve Norman, an independent council candidate from nearby Avonmouth.

His request, prompted by residents’ complaints about human waste, was initially refused by Nick Hooper, the council director responsible for gypsies and travellers.

Mr Hooper wrote in an email: ‘It is vital that we do not create any impression that the Council is sanctioning the use of this land for travellers by installing facilities.’

But in a fiery reply, Mr Norman said: ‘I feel sure I could muster up enough fellow constituents to clean-up and bag the excrement free of charge and deliver it to yours and [Bristol] Mayor Ferguson’s abodes.

‘Clearly it is your intentions to take us back to the dark ages in Shirehampton/Avonmouth because deciding to act otherwise will give the wrong “impression”.’

After the council lost its court application last Thursday, Mr Hooper relented and said the council would provide temporary toilet facilities.

A spokesman for Bristol City Council said: ‘We have obtained a possession order which we are not able to pursue because of an injunction obtained to prevent the order being enforced.

‘We are unable to comment further as the matter is currently before the court for resolution.’

The authority will return to the high court in six weeks’ time in a big to once again get the family’s injunction removed.

The O’Brien family said they had offered all along to pay for the toilet, but the council had refused - and then insisted they have it for free.

They said they are currently on the waiting list for a place at the council’s permanent caravan site in nearby Ashton.

Parminder Sanghera, a legal representative for the O’Briens, said: ‘The O’Brien family do not want to discuss their ongoing case.

‘I am not authorised to discuss any aspect of the case.’
