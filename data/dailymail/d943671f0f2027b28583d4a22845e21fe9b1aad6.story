After 118 goalless minutes Angel Di Maria's dramatic late winner for Argentina against Switzerland was worth the wait.

The Real Madrid man was slipped in by Lionel Messi to fire a first-time left-foot shot from the right side of the area across goal and into the far corner of the net.

And the important moment was captured on film by CNN cameras in Buenos Aires, as jubilant football fans in Argentina celebrated another massive win for Alejandro Sabella's side.

Crucial: In the video Argentina fans are heard cheering Di Maria's goal in unison

In the video Argentina supporters are heard cheering wildly as they breathe a sigh of relief that Di Maria won the game instead of losing it.

The winger gave the ball away 51 times over the course of the match and had a pass completion rate of just 63%.

But his goal secured Argentina's fourth win of the tournament, and their first without Messi on the scoresheet, and although it was again unconvincing that doesn't matter as a quarter-final meeting with Belgium on Saturday is confirmed.

Afterwards Di Maria told Argentina's official Twitter account: 'We left our souls (on the pitch). We kept trying to play, we never lost hope. The victory is even more deserved.'
