Exposed: A scorned ex-lover of reggae artist Sean Paul, pictured, has written a tell-all book

A scorned ex-lover of Grammy Award-winning reggae artist Sean Paul has exposed the star's alleged 'severe erection problems' in a tell-all book, as she sues him for $80 million. 

Swede, Susanne Persson, who brags in court documents of having long 'Barbie hair' and an 'E-cup bra' size, claims Paul 'bribed Jamaican police' to have her deported from the country in June 2010 - something which drove her to attempt suicide.

Getting intimate revenge, Persson filed a self-penned 120-page alleged exposé to support her Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit, in which she claims that 'if (sex with Paul) lasts one minute, it is a good day.'

The 11-capter work, titled: 'Irie Jamboree: My life in Jamaica as a jet set slave with the enormous secret of a love affair with Jamaica's perhaps most well known Dancehall Artist.'

The cover features a childish drawing of Persson wearing a blue sari embracing a mohawked Paul, and reads: 'The Truth About Sean Paul's Cocaine Dealings, Lies, Murders and Erection Problems.'

Inside, she claims: 'Ever since (Paul) started using cocaine regularly, he has had severe erection problems. If it lasts one minute, it is a good day.'

According to The New York Post, Persson included her American Airlines itinerary from Kingston, Jamaica, to Stockholm, Sweden, on June 24, in the court filing.

The ticket was bought by Paul's 
promotion company, Headline Entertainment, and the lawsuit claims 
Jamaican immigration authorities forced her to board the plane.

Paul's lawyer, Tom Taveres-Finson, denied his client had his former flame kicked out of the country.

'He would not have the power to do that,' Taveres-Finson told The Post from Jamaica.

Persson claims she tried to take her own life the day before she flew out, and then sent photos of her slit wrists to the reggae artist.

'I had tried to kill myself, losing more than one liter of blood from a cut on my wrist,' she wrote.

'I had shown the pictures of the cuts to Sean over the Internet. I feel he should see what he had caused.'

According to The Post, Persson alleges the 39-year-old singer destroyed her life, subjecting her to 'starvation, homelessness, repeated suicide attempts (and) loss of ability to generate income.'

In the supporting documents, the Swede boasts about her 'long, blonde Barbie hair' and 'E-cup bra' size. She also claims Paul took hundreds of nude photos of her, which he 'obtained under the pretext of a future marriage.'
