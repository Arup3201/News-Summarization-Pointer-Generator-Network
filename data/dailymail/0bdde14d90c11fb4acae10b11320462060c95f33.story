They say some people have so much money they don't know what to do with it.

And it appears this gentleman might be a case in point after using a €50 note to wipe raindrops off his face at the Galway races in Ireland.

As a TV presenter interviews Barry Orr from Betfair in the pouring rain, a man in the background can be seen rifling around in his jacket pockets.

Surprise: But instead of pulling out a tissue or hanky, the man grabs a ¿50 note and starts wiping raindrops off his face with it

But instead of pulling out a tissue or hanky, the race fan pulls out a €50 note and starts to mope his face dry with it.

Throughout the footage the man appears completely undaunted by using the money - worth around £47 or $66 - as a face wipe.

The footage was uploaded to YouTube on Thursday and had more than 270,000 views by this morning.

In the rain: But the endeavor proved a bit pointless as the man continued to get wet in the pouring rain

Many viewers suggested the man pulled the stunt just to get himself noticed on television.

Dasymeter wrote: 'He got﻿ what he wanted, his face on TV. Congrats. Mission succeeded. Hit the lights when you leave.'

While others suggested it wasn't a real €50 note. Kouskes wrote: 'People, it's a paper handkerchief with a fifty printed on it you can﻿ buy that party item everywhere, such a commotion over nothing!'
