A happy memory of Singapore: The photo that the Duke and Duchess have sent out to wellwishers

She has barely reached the half-way stage of her pregnancy.

But the Duchess of Cambridge has been so inundated with good wishes from members of the public that she and her husband, Prince William, have created a special card to thank them.

In recent days the couple’s office at St James Palace has been sending out the elegant ‘thank you notes’ to members of the public who have written to them in the past few weeks.

Rather than the more traditional-style 
letter normally sent out by members of the Royal Family, this one is a 
postcard with a picture on the front of William and Kate taken on their 
official visit to Singapore last year.

On the back is the message: ‘The Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge were touched by your kind words following the 
wonderful news that they are expecting their first baby.

'It really was most thoughtful of you and Their Royal Highnesses send their warmest thanks and best wishes.'

The baby is most likely to have been conceived in early to mid-October, shortly after the couple returned from their tour of the South Pacific.Sources have told the Mail the Duchess was not pregnant or actively trying for a baby during the two-week trip due to the anti-malaria medication that she was taking, drugs that she would needed for a further week after returning home on September 20.She would most likely have conceived either at their homes in Anglesey or London.At the time the couple had a series of public engagements including a visit to Middle Temple Inn in London to launch a scholarship scheme in their names on October 8.The following day they visited the FA’s new training centre at St George’s Park in Staffordshire.On October 10 the Duchess was in Newcastle while her husband attended the funeral of his former nanny, Olga Powell.That evening they met for a private dinner at the LouLou club in Mayfair. The following day the prince made a solo appearance at a dinner at St James’s Palace.

A personal touch: The thank you card that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have sent out to people who wrote to congratulate them

The card is not signed by Kate but the envelope in which it comes bears her distinctive ‘C’ cypher.

The picture on the front was chosen personally by the couple.

It shows them on the very first day of their tour of south east Asia to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee at Singapore’s Botanical Gardens.

Kate was wearing an exquisite pale pink kimono-style dress.

It was made especially for her by British designer Jenny Packham, and covered with tiny orchids.

It was an appropriate choice since the couple were being afforded the honour of having an orchid name after them, a purple spotted ‘Vanda William Catherine’.

A St James’s Palace spokesman said the cards were being sent out by the Duke and Duchess’s Correspondence team as the couple had been touched by the number of good wishes they had received.

The couple’s first baby, who will be third in line to the throne, is due in July.

There is much speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge may be expecting twins because of her age and the acute morning sickness that she experienced in the early stages of pregnancy.

Bookmakers slashed the odds on twins from 50/1 to 8/1 after her hyperemesis gravidarum - a kind of morning sickness - in December.

No mother of a future monarch has given birth to twins in Britain since the 15th century.

However, under new legislation, if the Duchess of Cambridge does gives birth to a boy and a girl, it will be the first-born who succeeds – no matter their gender.

The Duke and Duchess recently went for a
Caribbean holiday on the island of Mustique as a 'babymoon' break 
before their baby arrives.

However, the Duchess has since been back to her usual duties visiting people around Britain, and her schedule has been a busy one.

Most recently she was seen this month at Hope House, a 23-bed treatment centre in Clapham, south-west London, run by Action on Addiction, a charity of which she is patron.
