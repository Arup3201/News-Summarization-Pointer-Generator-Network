Don't skimp on proteins, try swapping quinoa for rice and gulp down fermented milk, kefir.

These are just some of the foods and drinks you need to be incorporating into your post-exercise diet.

And try to eat within an hour of finishing your workout as that's when your body needs it most as it  starts to burn food as well as recover.

What you eat after a workout can increase the benefits of exercise

'What you eat post workout is extremely important. The aim of a healthy post workout snack/meal is to improve recovery, reduce muscle soreness, increase the ability to build muscle and to help with your immune system,' said Shona Wilkinson, head nutritionist at NutriCentre.

'It is best to eat your food within one hour after you finish your exercise. Waiting too long will mean that you don't refill your glycogen stores and wont recover fully,' she continued.

According to Ms Wilkinson, the perfect post workout snack or meal consists of both carbs and protein.

Good examples include wholewheat muffins with nut butter, scrambled eggs on whole wheat toast and chicken breast with brown rice or quinoa. 

Try swapping quinoa (left)  for rice when cooking a post-gym meal. Hummus and pita (right) are good snacks as they contain carbohydrates and protein 

A good source of protein and fibre, quinoa gets the thumbs of from Ms Wilkinson. 

'This is a great food to have after a workout to ensure you are getting a good intake of nutrients,' she explained. 

The nutrionist also explained what kefir is, and why it's good for you. 

'Kefir results when milk is combined with bacteria and allowed to ferment,' she said. 

'It is high in protein and will help with the recovery of your muscles.'

Wholewheat pitta and hummus can provide much needed carbs and protein whilst pineapple, rich in an enzyme called bromelain, is useful for preventing injuries. 

You can still indulge in a plate of fish and chips; just make sure that you have oily fish instead of cod or hake

Steak contains zinc which is critical to prostate health and fertility, and iron which is a key component of oxygen delivery within your cells

Starchy vegetables such as sweet potato can be eaten hot or cold green vegetables such as broccoli, kale and beans help alkalise the body. 

And while fried fish and chips may not necessarily sound healthy, swapping oily fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines or anchovies for cod and hake, will improve body fat burning. 

Finally steak, which contains zinc as well as protein, helps deliver oxygen to cells.  

Here FEMAIL has identified the foods you need to incorporate into your diet to ensure your body recovers well from a workout.  

Quinoa

Quiona is a great alternative to rice. I often recommend it as it is a good source of protein and fibre. This is a great food to have after a workout to ensure you are getting a good intake of nutrients,' Ms Wilkinson said. 

Kefir

'It is becoming increasingly popular due to its probiotic content which can help with digestive health,' said Ms Wilkinson. 

'It is also high in protein. You can drink a cup of kefir after a workout for a healthy way to get a good healthy intake of protein to help with the repair and recovery of your muscles.'

Pita and hummus

'Pitta and hummus is a great combination for a post workout snack,' the nutrionist advised. 

'Go for wholewheat pita rather than white pita. Hummus is a good source of protein and carbs. The wholewheat pita is a good source of slow releasing carbs to keep your energy levels up.

Sweet potato (left) is a nutritionally dense carb whilst green vegetables (right) will help prevent fatigue 

Fermented milk kefir is high in protein and will help with muscle recovery 

Pineapple

Pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain. Bromelain helps with digesting protein and is a helpful anti-inflammatory which is useful for preventing injuries. Pineapple also contains fibre, vitamin B6, manganese and is a great source of Vitamin C.

Steak is high in protein, which is excellent for muscle recovery and also in iron stores which helps reduce fatigue. It's an ideal meat for athletes to consume during their training programme.

Sweet potato is an excellent carbohydrate source so it contributes to the recovery of normal muscle function after hard training. 

The green veg provides vitamins A and C which support the immune system to function normally, which is hampered with hard training.

Sweet potato

Try a starchy vegetable such as sweet potato for a nutritionally dense carbohydrate snack after your workout. Sweet potato is just as delicious whether eaten hot or cold.

Fish and chips

Opt for a healthy version of fish and chips. Go for an oily fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines or anchovies. These fish contain plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids to improve body fat burning as well as a good source of protein to help rebuild muscle.

Steak

A a great source of protein. It also contains zinc which is critical to prostate health and fertility, iron which is a key component of oxygen delivery within your cells and selenium which gives your immune system a boost.

Green vegetables

Green vegetables are anti-inflammatory and also help alkalise the body. This will help towards preventing muscle pain, fatigue and injury.
