George Osborne yesterday won backing from the International Monetary Fund, as it welcomed improvements in the economy.

It will come as a relief to the Chancellor who was last month heavily criticised by the watchdog's chief economist for sticking to his austerity policies.

The IMF yesterday urged Mr Osborne to cut business taxes and increase infrastructure spending to build on the burgeoning recovery.

It also warned the country remains 'a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery' because of the eurozone crisis, a shortage of bank lending and government cuts.

The annual report on the UK, published after two weeks of in-depth analysis by IMF inspectors, called for extra spending to offset the impact of his planned cuts this year but stopped short of demanding that austerity is ditched altogether. Indeed, it backed the Chancellor's 'essential' efforts to eliminate the record £159billion deficit racked up by Labour and described his plans as 'credible'.

Mr Osborne said: 'I agree that it is right to prioritise infrastructure investment where we can.

'That's why we are investing more in capital than my predecessor planned. That's why I've added in the last two years to those plans. And that's why it will be a focus of the spending round next month.'

The IMF report came as official figures yesterday showed the Government borrowed £119.5billion last year, slightly down from £120.9billion in 2011-12.

While backing the deficit reduction, the IMF report went on to warn that the £10billion of cuts due this year 'will be a drag on growth'.

The Chancellor addressed a press conference at the Treasury, with IMF assessors looking on after their issued their call for measures to boost growth

To ensure stronger growth, the report 
called for tax cuts for businesses and billions of pounds of extra 
spending on infrastructure projects such as schools repairs and social 
housing.

It said: 'Given the tepid recovery, policy should capitalise on the nascent signs of momentum to bolster growth.'

It
also called on ministers to outline a 'clear strategy' for selling 
government stakes in taxpayer-backed lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and 
Lloyds Banking Group.

And it
urged the Bank of England to consider pumping more money into the 
economy and 'provide assurance' to households and investors that 
interest rates will remain at rock bottom 'until the recovery reaches 
full momentum'.

The analysis of the Chancellor's handling of the economy was better than many in the Treasury feared.

Last
month the Fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard accused Mr Osborne 
of 'playing with fire' by sticking with his austerity policies while the
economy was so weak.

However,
David Lipton, deputy to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, 
acknowledged 'there is no single silver bullet' to solve the UK's 
problems. He said: 'We recognise that higher fiscal support for the 
economy is not a straight forward as the deficit is still high.

'But the Government's credible medium-term consolidation plan affords space to provide this support.

'The Government should be more supportive of growth than it has been and plans to be.'

Shadow
chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IMF is clear that we are a long way from
the strong and sustained recovery we need, and backs the warnings we 
have made for three years that the Government's plans are a drag on 
growth and risk doing long-term damage.'

But
John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said: 'The IMF's assessment
chimes with our own view that a modest recovery looks to be taking 
shape. But there is still room for manoeuvre to boost growth and jobs 
within the current strategy.

'The Government must now dramatically step up the pace of action in these areas.'
