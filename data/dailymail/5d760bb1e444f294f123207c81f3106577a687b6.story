Louis van Gaal is insistent that despite the influx of foreign players at Old Trafford this summer, everyone at the club must speak English.

Spanish speakers Ander Herrera, Angel Di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Radamel Falcao have all joined Manchester United, and communicate in their mother tongue with each other and Spaniards David de Gea and Juan Mata.

And although Van Gaal can himself speak fluent Spanish from his time at Barcelona, he has ordered his players to be communicating in English by the end of the season.

Radamel Falcao speaks good English and barely used an interpreter when unveiled as a United player 

'You know already that all the Spanish players have lessons in English so we have started already more than two weeks,' he was quoted as saying  in the Manchester Evening News.  

'We are only two weeks in this country because we were in the USA and after that we had the international week. But I can speak Spanish so it is better to communicate sometimes on the pitch in Spanish.

'But they shall learn English within one year, I promise.'

United's Spanish speakers could be helped in their quest to learn the new language by Colombian striker Falcao, who speaks good English, and impressed Van Gaal at his unveiling when he spoke the language with barely any need for an interpreter.

One player who could look to emulate Falcao is winger Antonio Valencia, who has been ordered by Van Gaal to take English lessons – despite having lived in England for eight years.
