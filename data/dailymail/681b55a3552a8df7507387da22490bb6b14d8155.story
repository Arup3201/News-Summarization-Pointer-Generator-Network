Three swans have been beheaded and their carcasses discarded opposite a pub.

The severed heads of three birds were found by anglers close to Mount Farm Lake near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire last week.

Steven Cooper, the fisheries officer and secretary of the Beacon Angling Club, discovered the first head lying on the lakeside.

He said: 'I’ve been a member of the club for 10 years, but have never known anything like this.

'I was out one afternoon and the head was just lying there by the waterside opposite The Inn On The Lake pub.

'Anyone could have come across it - a runner, someone walking their dogs, a small child. It was horrible.

'We have found three heads, and one of them had the body close by it. It doesn’t look like it was done by an animal, it was a sharp blade that took the heads off.

Mount Farm Park Lake: Three dead swans were found here with their heads severed

'Some sick person is out there with a vendetta against these swans and they’ve got to be stopped.'

All swans in Britain are the property
 of Queen Elizabeth II, who owns all mute swans.

In a law dating back to
 the 12th century, swans have been owned by the Royal household who once
 considered them a delicacy.

The swans were marked by a 
royal Swan Marker, a job still in existence, but it now focuses on offering advise to various 
organisations about the welfare of swans and 
vandalism against the bird.

Today, killing a swan can result in a six-month jail sentence and/or a fine of up to £5,000.

Mr Cooper is urging anyone with information to contact the police.

He added: 'We keep an eye on what is going on at the lake. Our bailiffs monitor the lake daily and have been told about the issue.

'As a club we take responsibility for all wildlife here - the swans, the geese, the foxes and the owl.

'In the past we have been in the lake saving cygnets which have got caught, or other injured birds.

'The animals were here before we were, and it’s up to us to share the area. Whoever killed these swans is just sick.”
