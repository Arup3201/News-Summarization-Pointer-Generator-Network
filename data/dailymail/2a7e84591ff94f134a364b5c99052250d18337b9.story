Britain was embroiled in a costly legal farce last night over the fate of up to 90 Taliban detainees suspected of trying to kill UK troops.

Lawyers for the Afghans – given a huge platform yesterday by the BBC – claimed the prisoners are being illegally detained at a ‘secret’ prison within Camp Bastion in Helmand Province and demanded they be brought before a court or released.

But when Defence Secretary Philip Hammond indicated that the military was prepared to release them to the Afghan authorities, the same lawyers – funded by legal aid – said they might launch fresh action in the UK courts to prevent that happening.

They claim handing the prisoners over 
to the Afghan police would place them in danger of being tortured, and 
therefore infringe their human rights.

To add to the confusion, the Afghan 
defence ministry is now demanding the detainees be delivered to be dealt
 with ‘according to our judicial laws’.

The case had been presented on the BBC’s flagship Today programme as the scandal of Britain’s Guantanamo Bay.

But last night it appeared more fiasco than scandal.

Until last year, British forces in 
Afghanistan were allowed to detain suspects for a maximum of 96 hours 
except in ‘exceptional cases’ before handing them over to be dealt with 
by the Afghan authorities.

But in 2010 the High Court ordered 
that detainees should not be released into the hands of the Afghans 
because of concerns over torture.

So the only alternative to detention 
now is the release of prisoners into the local Afghan community, with 
the clear risk they would soon be launching fresh attacks on British 
troops.

Yesterday it was revealed that up to 
90 Afghans are being held at Bastion, including a teenager who has been 
in custody for 14 months, without trial or access to lawyers in what 
British human rights lawyer Phil Shiner said was a breach of 
international law.

But Mr Hammond hit back, dismissing 
the claim of a secret jail as ‘patently absurd’ and warning that the 
release of the men – arrested by British soldiers in raids in Helmand 
and Kandahar provinces and believed to be responsible for the killing 
and wounding of troops – would put the UK military at risk.

He said: ‘These are people suspected 
of murdering British troops by facilitating or planting or being 
involved with IEDs (improvised explosive devices) at a time when most 
people are focused on how we protect our troops from being murdered, 
whether it’s on the streets of London or on the battlefield.’

Mr Hammond said Britain had been 
working with the Afghans to establish a ‘safe pathway’ for the transfer 
of the detainees and pointed out the legal proceedings were at ‘the 
expense, of course, of the British taxpayer’ because they are funded by 
the legal aid system.

‘We want nothing more than to be able to hand these people over,’ he said.

And last night the Ministry of Defence said it had found a ‘safe route’ to hand over the prisoners.

But Mr Shiner, of Public Interest 
Lawyers, representing some of those involved in the court action, 
claimed the Government was failing to deal with the suspects ‘humanely’ 
and according to international law.

‘The UK could have trained the Afghan 
authorities to detain people lawfully with proper standards and making 
sure that they are treated humanely,’ he said.

‘They could have monitored that, 
including inspections to make sure  the Afghans were obeying the law. 
They have chosen not to do so.’

Richard Stein from law firm Leigh Day,
 who is representing one of the detainees, said: ‘We have been asking 
for access to our client since March and, to date, it has still not been
 provided.’

Last night General Zahir Azimi, a 
spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defence, demanded: ‘The prisoners 
must be handed over to the Afghan authorities.

‘They will be dealt with according to our laws, and agreements reached with the international community.’

However the lawyers may take more court action to prevent the men being handed over.

Crusading: The Guantanamo comparison was made by lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan

Listeners to BBC radio were assured 
that it was a scandal to compare with Guantanamo Bay and the American 
detention of terror suspects without time limit and without trial.

Breathlessly,
 reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 
Afghans were in a British holding camp near Kabul. This might amount to 
unlawful detention and internment, they said.

A
 little later a familiar name appeared in the BBC reports. The 
Guantanamo comparison was made by crusading lawyer Phil Shiner, a 
long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

Indeed, it was
 Mr Shiner who led the case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on 
the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, 
which compelled the British military to keep so many prisoners in 
detention in the first place.

In
 January 2010 he wrote on the Guardian’s website: ‘My firm’s next case 
focuses on the UK’s detention policy in Afghanistan, where we routinely 
hand over Afghans to the Afghan authorities in full knowledge of the 
torture, summary executions and disappearances occurring within their 
facilities.’

Mr 
Shiner, 56, was a Birmingham University graduate who became an articled 
clerk and then a solicitor in the city. He worked for a decade for legal
 firms, a council estate project, a law centre and the Barnardo’s 
charity before founding his own firm in 1999.

The
 father of five is also a visiting professor at London Metropolitan 
University, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, and was
 awarded the title ‘Human Rights Lawyer of the Year’ in 2004.

He has repeatedly denied that he is an ‘ambulance chaser’ and calls the idea that he trawls for work‘ laughable’.

His
 firm, Public Interest Lawyers, made its name in Iraq, where Mr Shiner 
represented alleged victims of abuses by British troops, including 
relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody.

Nearly £3million has been paid in compensation to the family of Mr Mousa and other men.
 Mr Shiner sent a representative to Iraq to find and interview people 
who claimed to have been harmed by the British, and their claims were 
brought to the British courts.

Public
 Interest Lawyers says it is currently acting for more than 130 former 
detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully 
detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq.

Controversial: The detention facility at Camp Bastion, where the BBC said up to 90 Afghans are held

The firm’s interests are, 
however, not exclusively abroad. It says its mission is ‘helping 
individuals like you challenge the unlawful behaviour of those who 
govern us both nationally and locally’.

Its
 most recent highly-publicised domestic case was last month when it 
represented a campaign group who objected to the use of unpaid workers 
in Surrey libraries on the grounds they had not received equality 
training.

It won the case 
and the county council was barred by a High Court judge from using 
volunteers to work in its libraries. This was, said Mr Shiner, a 
‘fantastic result’.

The libraries are now threatened with closure.
