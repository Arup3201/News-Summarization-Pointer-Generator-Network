It is amazing that photographer Patrick Hall had any volunteers for his latest studio project.

But the wedding lensman from South Carolina managed to persuade 100 people to get shot with a stun gun for his Taser Photoshoot, and the result is an incredible series of images capturing real, raw emotion.

'As a portrait photographer, I am always trying to make people feel comfortable in front of my camera so I can capture a real emotion from them. But what if I was able to make people feel so uncomfortable in front of the camera that I could guarantee an interesting portrait every time?' he says of the idea behind his latest series.

The photographer from South Carolina managed to persuade 100 people to get shot with a stun gun for his Taser Photoshoot

Wedding photographer Patrick said: 'As a portrait photographer, I am always trying to make people feel comfortable in front of my camera.'

The photographer required each subject to receive the 300,000 volt shock from their friend or significant other, who often appeared to enjoy inflicting pain on their loved one, creating 'an interesting dynamic in itself'.

'The emotions on both sides of the Taser were extremely entertaining to watch,' he writes.

'The
 person getting tased was almost always nervous and jittery with either a
 sense of fear or anxiety. The participants doing the tasing had a 
different demeanor altogether.

'Most of them were excited to cause pain 
to their friend and only showed remorse immediately after executing the 
shock.'Â 

The American wanted to try something new and to make people feel so uncomfortable in front of the camera that he could guarantee an interesting portrait with every frame

A few people looked like they were experiencing pleasure, some jumped and some fell to the ground

In an extra twist, the photographer required each subject to receive the 300,000 volt shock from their friend or significant other

Patrick explained that the partners appeared to enjoy inflicting pain on their loved ones, creating 'an interesting dynamic'

Patrick recorded both of these
 reactions and edited them into a nail-biting slow motion video, and a behind the scenes clip illustrating the project, adding: 'What I found most interesting about the reactions people showed while getting tased was you never knew how they would react.

'Some
 people screamed while others were quiet. A few people looked like they 
were experiencing pleasure while others had the most painful faces I've 
ever seen. I saw jumpers and fallers. People laughed and people cursed.'
