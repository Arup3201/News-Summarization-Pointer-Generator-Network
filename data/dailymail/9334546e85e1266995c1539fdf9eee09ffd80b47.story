This is

surgeon-gynaecologist for 18 years and cared for Sophie, Countess of 
Wessex, delivering her two babies, Lady Louise Windsor, now nine, and 
James, Viscount Severn, four.

The
 Countess collapsed and was close to death when Lady Louise was born 
prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb.

Edward VII Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for her 
morning sickness.

In 
recognition of his work, the father-of-four was awarded a personal 
honour by the Queen in 2004 when he was made a Commander of the Royal 
Victorian Order.

When 
Mr Farthing took on his role for the royal household in 2008, he became 
one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family.

Mr
 Farthing went on to open his own private Harley Street practice and 
works as a consultant at two teaching hospitals in London, Queen 
Charlotte’s in Shepherd’s Bush and St Mary’s.

Prince
 William and his brother Harry were delivered by Mr Setchell’s 
predecessor, the late Sir George Pinker, who delivered nine royal babies
 between 1973 and 1990.

Mr
 Farthing was engaged to Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando, 37, when she was 
murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry.

The couple 
met at a dinner party in 1997 and announced their engagement in 1999.

Miss Dando was shot dead on her doorstep in April that year and her murder remains unsolved.

Four years ago he married Dr Janet Stowell, 35, whom he met in 2003 when she was a young house doctor at St Mary’s, Paddington.

They live in St John’s Wood, London in a detached £3 million house, and have a two-year-old son.

'Alan is incredibly contented with life - he's never been a complex man,' says a colleague.

'He loves his family, and he loves his work - it was just the same when he was with Jill, total dedication.'
