Steve Hodgson quit his Met Police post in disgrace after using the expression 'n***** in the woodpile' in front of shocked colleagues

A Metropolitan Police finance boss has quit in  disgrace after using the expression 'n***** in the woodpile' in front of shocked colleagues.

Steve Hodgson is said to have been thrown out of the meeting he was chairing after making the offensive comment.

Mr Hodgson, who was hired by the force in February to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from its budget, left the premises immediately.

He is thought to have been overseeing a finance discussion between staff from the force's finance, human resources and IT departments at the time.

The management consultant, who has also worked for the Department of Health, British Airways and the Royal Mail, where he built a reputation for ruthless cost cutting, later apologised and resigned from his six-figure post.

But he then issued a statement through the force to say he did not recall making the comment, but could not be sure that he did not  make it either.

Yesterday it emerged that he was still being paid by the Metropolitan Police more than a fortnight later while a successor was appointed.

A spokesman for the force refused to say in what context the expression he used was made.

The phrase dates back to the 19th century and refers to escaped slaves in American's Deep South who tried to evade recapture by hiding in places such as a stack of logs.

In a statement, the Yard said: 'We can confirm Steve Hodgson has taken the decision to resign from his role as interim director of shared support services following allegations that an ill-judged comment was made by Steve in a recent meeting.

'Steve is clear he does not recall making the comment but nor can he be certain enough he didn't say it to categorically deny it.

'In the circumstances, he has decided the most appropriate option is to apologise for any offence he may have caused and to resign.

Steve Hodgson, who previously worked for the Royal Mail, is said to have uttered the racist phrase while managing a discussion on cost-cutting

'Steve left the Metropolitan Police Service premises immediately but will continue to be employed for a short period to allow for a full handover of his work to take place.'

The consultant, who describes himself as a 'strong leader of transformational change programmes', was recruited to trim 30 per cent from the finance, HR, operational support and IT departments and the Met's extensive property portfolio.

Educated at Thames Valley  University, where he gained a post-graduate diploma in training  management and human resource management, he has a background in aeronautics.

After completing an HND in aerospace studies at the RAF College in 1990, he worked as HR director for BAE Systems before moving to Royal Mail in 2003 where he saved £50million from its HR budget.

He then worked as a director of shared services at the Prison Service before leaving in 2008 to work as a consultant on short-term management projects for the Department of Health, BA, the British Airports Authority, Cheshire Police and a steel company before taking on the role at the Met.

The country's biggest police force has struggled since 1999 to shake off the tag of 'institutional racism' attached to it in the Macpherson Report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, has declared himself an 'implacable enemy' of  racism but allegations of racist behaviour continue.

Last month it emerged that the force has paid out almost £666,000 in compensation to settle racism claims against officers and staff since 2009. Most of the payouts were made in out-of-court settlements.

The figures were disclosed by the office of London Mayor Boris Johnson at the request of Andrew Dismore, a Labour member of the London Assembly who said they illustrate the force 'still has a problem with racism'.
