Private messages: Mr Justice Mostyn is accused of making 'disobliging remarks'

One of the country’s top judges has caused controversy by making disparaging private remarks about a barrister involved in his own divorce battle.

Mr Justice Mostyn criticised Charles Howard QC, who represented the judge’s former wife during their acrimonious split.

He made the comments after Mr Howard appeared before him at the High Court in an unrelated divorce case involving Mark and Jennifer Evans, who were battling over their £50 million fortune.

Following Mr Justice Mostyn’s remarks, Mr Howard pulled out of the case – and warned that his withdrawal would have ‘serious consequences’ for Mrs Evans in her legal fight.

Mr Howard also suggested the judge’s comments were motivated by a ‘personal animosity’.

It is not known exactly what Mr Justice Mostyn said to upset the QC. But court papers show that Mr Howard claimed the judge ‘remarked disobligingly’ on his conduct and that of London firm Hughes Fowler Carruthers, who are also on Mrs Evans’s team.

After the comments, which were made in messages to Mr Justice Mostyn’s ex-wife Lucy on April 5, Mr Howard and his team withdrew from the case.

Mr Howard said this left Mrs Evans ‘without representation in relation to the finances’.

Following an appeal, Mr Justice Mostyn’s £26 million settlement  in the Evans case was set aside  by the president of the family division of the High Court, Sir Nicholas Wall.

At the time of the controversial remarks, Mr Justice Mostyn and Lucy were still thrashing out their own divorce, which was finalised in May.

It caused shockwaves in the legal world in 2010 when Mr Justice Mostyn left his wife of more than 30 years for divorce lawyer Elizabeth Saunders.

Mrs Saunders’ alcoholic husband Mark, who was also a barrister, was shot dead by police marksmen in 2008 after he drunkenly fired a shotgun from the couple’s £2 million Chelsea home.

The extraordinary discord between Mr Justice Mostyn and Mr Howard was laid bare in a written submission to the court made by Mr Howard, supporting Mrs Evans’s attempt to block her divorce being finalised until a  ruling has been made on how much she should receive.

In his submission, Mr Howard stated: ‘The remarks were later described to the wife [by her solicitor] as “indicating that Mr Justice Mostyn had personal animosity towards Charles Howard QC, my firm, and possibly me”.

‘As a result of the actions of Mr Justice Mostyn .  .  . she [Mrs Evans] will be placed in a materially  different position at the retrial, namely that she will be an ex-wife of the husband. That might have serious consequences for her.’

The Evans case received widespread publicity last week when Appeal Court judge Lord Justice Thorpe accused the couple of ‘almost puerile’ behaviour.

Mr Evans, 47, and his wife, 46, were penniless when they wed in 1985 but made a fortune from a computer software company.

They separated in July 2010 and in April last year, she was awarded assets of £26 million.

But as a result of Mr Justice Mostyn’s ruling being overturned in May, they are still waiting for the courts to decide how their financial assets should be split.

Mr Justice Mostyn was nicknamed ‘Mr Payout’ because of the huge settlements he obtained as a divorce lawyer for celebrity clients such as Sir Paul McCartney.

His own divorce was finalised on May 8. Mr Howard withdrew from the Evans case on April 17, according to his submission. He has since returned, however, and last week represented Mrs Evans in her Appeal Court bid.

A spokesman for the Judicial Communications Office, which represents judges and magistrates, said an agreement had been in place since July 2011 which meant ‘there would be no conflict of interest’ if Mr Justice Mostyn heard other cases which involved ‘the solicitors and barristers acting for Lady Mostyn in their divorce proceedings’.

The spokesman added: ‘The private remarks about Mr Howard and Hughes Fowler Carruthers were made after he had heard and given judgment in the case of Evans v Evans.’

Mr Howard and Hughes Fowler Carruthers declined to comment.
