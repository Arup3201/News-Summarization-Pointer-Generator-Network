Clay figurines made by people living in Ghana 1,400-years ago, have gone on show in Britain for the first time.

The figurines, which include two-headed humans, a chameleon, crocodile and man on horseback, are thought to have been used to invoke the help of ancestors to cure illnesses, archaeologists said.

The clay models measure up to 31cm in height and show the costumes and weapons worn and used by the people living in Ghana at the time.

Clay figurines made by people living in Ghana 1,400-years ago, are to go on show in Britain for the first time. The figurines, which include two-headed humans, crocodile (pictured) and man on horseback.

The precious clay figurines were excavated by archaeologists from the universities of Ghana and Manchester and the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board (GMMB).

They have just gone on show at the Manchester Museum - the first time they will be seen publicly outside Ghana.

The team of experts believe the figurines were used to invoke the help of ancestors to cure illnesses.

Using computed tomography scanning techniques at the University of Manchester, the experts revealed hidden channels within the objects.

They believe these channels had a medicinal function and were used for liquid ritual offerings.

The clay models measure up to 31 
centimetres in height and show the costumes and weapons worn and used by
the people living in Ghana at the time. The figurine on the left shows that the people used animals to travel long distances, while on the right is a Janus-like model with two 'human' heads

Professor Insoll from the University of Manchester, told MailOnline: 'The figurines seem to have been offered libations - perhaps of blood or beer - and perhaps had sacrifices made to them.

'They might have been used to make herbal medicines more powerful, which might then have been drunk or applied to the body. It is still relatively early in the research so we cannot say for certain.'

The figurines show people with congenital conditions including anencephaly (the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull and scalp that occurs during embryonic development,) which still affects children in Africa today - while others show clothes and symbolic animals that had symbolic roles.

Some figurines in the collection were also possibly ‘scapegoats’ and were intended as the focus or recipient of disease and misfortune rather than their human keepers.

The figures have been dated to between the 6th and the 14th centuries.

'The representations of the people in the figurines suggests that both 
men and women used them - but not children perhaps - as they are very 
rarely represented and might not have had the ritual status and 
maturity to use them,' Professor Insoll told MailOnline.

Further analysis by the team, led by Professor Benjamin Kankpeyeng and involving Professor Insoll, will show what liquid ritual offerings were actually used.

The figurines were found in a village called Yikpabongo in Koma Land in the north of Ghana and come from two mounds thought to be used as a shrine by the makers of the objects.

While the models are thought to have been relatively common, 'the way they were 
deposited suggests they were thought of as spiritually valuable, perhaps
as ancestors,' said Professor Insoll.

Because the figurines are highly sought after in the art market, some mounds in the region have been illegally excavated but Professor Insol told MailOnline there could possibly be as many as several thousand mounds to discover, that could hold similar treasures.

The mounds have been added to the International Council of Museums Red List, a register of archaeological material at risk.

Professor Kankpeyeng said: 'These figurines are unique to the region and offer an insight into aspects of past human beliefs, ways of understanding and creativity.

'This has not always been possible, where there is no tradition of making representations, or when they simply have not survived.

men and women used the figurines - but not children - as they are very 
rarely represented and might not have had the ritual status and 
maturity to use them. The figurine on the left shows a seated woman,  while the one on the right is a type of lid with what is thought to be a Janus figure on top

The models include channels used for a medicinal function that were used for liquid ritual offerings to find out what the offerings were, it is thought the liquid could have been blood or beer.

They could have been used to make herbal medicines more powerful, which might then have been drunk or applied to the body.

The figurines might also have had sacrifices made to them.

Some figurines in the collection were also possibly ‘scapegoats’ and were intended as the focus or recipient of disease and misfortune rather than their human keepers, according to the experts.

'Their exquisite and consistent appearance obviously required a great deal of skill, suggesting those who made them were a specialist occupation.'

Professor Insoll said that little is known about the people who made the figurines and they are not thought to have any connection with Koma Land's current inhabitants.

'In fact, we know little in general about
the past in this part of Ghana, because there are few historical 
sources before the late 19th century and oral traditions are scarce,' he said.

'But archaeology is unlocking some of the secrets of the past, and this project shows what can be achieved.

'We
now know the figurines may have had ritual and medicinal functions and
the mounds  they were found in were perhaps medicine shrines, or places
for disposal of material considered dangerous if disposed of correctly.

'We
also know these people were farmers, who traded with cowry shells, used
iron tools and lived in villages, with complex religious beliefs'

By examining the figurines, the archaeologists, including Professor Insoll who is pictured left, now know the models have had ritual and medicinal functions and
the mounds they were found in were perhaps medicine shrines, or places
for disposal of material considered dangerous

He also said that the horse or camel figurine indicates awareness that animals could be used by people for long distance travel.

Speaking about the illegal trade of the ancient figures, Professor Kankpeyeng said: 'The people of the villages of Koma Land have a keen sense of the figurines as part of their heritage and deeply resent the unethical trade in such material.'

Professor Insoll said: 'The
people of the villages of Koma Land in Ghana are involved in the 
fieldwork (to collect figurines) and have a keen sense of the figurines as part of their 
heritage.

'So we are proud that this exhibition actively involves Ghanaian archaeologists and museum curators who are coming to Manchester to support it,' he said.

The exhibition is currently open and runs until May 5, 2014.
