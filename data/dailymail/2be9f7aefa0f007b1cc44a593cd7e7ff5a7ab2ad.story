Commenting on London’s selection as the Best City for Culture, Mayor of London Boris Johnson, said: 'London is home to some of the best museums and galleries in the world, with an unrivalled range of top-notch art, photography and installations that attract millions of visitors from around the globe. 

'The visual arts are part of a fabulous mix of cultural attractions that includes world-class theatre, concerts and dance, which give London the leading-edge as the world’s greatest city for culture. 

'Arts and culture are hugely important to our city's success and we look forward to welcoming tourists inspired to visit London following this latest accolade.'

Cultural institutions in cities as far and wide as Paris, New York, Miami, Shanghai, Oslo, Berlin and Mexico City, were among those competing to win nine awards at the event, held at Jumeirah Carlton Tower, London.

The winners of six of the awards were selected based on the cultural recommendations of leaders and innovators in the creative industries, such as Matthew Clark, co-founder of United Visual Artists, curator Jerome Sans, jewellery designer Anabela Chan and former Royal Academy Exhibitions director Kathleen Soriano, who have given their views for the Leading Culture Destinations online travel guide, which ranks the world’s best in arts and culture destinations.

Three awards were chosen by a special jury consisting of key members of the creative and culture industries and representatives from Leading Culture Destinations.

In their variety and breadth, the awards aim to reflect the changing landscape of cultural institutions, which has seen them become not only places to see art but also places to learn, socialize, shop and, sometimes, even sleep.

Florian Wupperfeld, co-founder of Leading Culture Destinations, said: 'We’re thrilled to present the inaugural Leading Culture Destinations Awards celebrating the best visual arts institutions around the world. 

'Culture is one of the key drivers for tourism, and a revolution in the sector has seen museums become not just places of cultural pilgrimage but social hubs, places to dine, to read and to explore the arts through the new digital technologies - and sometimes even to drop your children off for a sleep over, a change which we celebrate with our awards.

'Within culture, until now, most awards have been much more localised - and the only global ranking lists are based on footfall – making them entirely quantitative and not qualitative. 

'We hope the Leading Culture Destinations Awards will become a more helpful representation of what the world’s best arts institutions have to offer, recognising the sector’s innovators and leaders, and help more cultural travellers to discover them.”
