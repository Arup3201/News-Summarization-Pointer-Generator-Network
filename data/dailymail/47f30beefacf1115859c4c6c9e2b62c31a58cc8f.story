The stray dog that refused to leave a group of Swedish adventurers on an extreme sports race through the Amazon rain forest continues to recover in quarantine, after being adopted by the the team's captain. 

Arthur the dog made national headlines last November for tagging along with Mikael Lindnord and the rest of Team Peak Performance as the group of men hiked,  climbed and kayaked hundreds of miles through the Ecuadorian wild.

Earlier this month, the team updated Arthur's fans on Facebook after a trip to visit the recovering dog at a quarantine facility in their native Sweden.

Lifelong friends: Mikael Lindnord (right) decided to adopt stray dog Arthur last November, when the mutt refused to leave his team during a grueling extreme sports race through the Amazonian wilderness. Pictured above with Arthur in Sweden, where the dog continues to recover in quarantine 

Good to see you! Arthur jumps on the lap of Team Peak Performance'sStaffan Björklund during a visit to quarantine on February 5 

The team wrote that Arthur was originally scheduled to leave quarantine on February 5 to undergo surgery, but the request was denied at the last minute because he still wasn't in good enough health for the Swedish Board of Agriculture.

Instead, Lindnord and some of Arthur's other friends visited him in quarantine where he has experienced a 'huge progress in health'.

'We met a very happy dog and it didn’t take a second before he recognize us and jumped in to my knee, we where so happy to see him today [sic],' the post reads. 

According to the post, the dirt on Arthur's skin is gone, his ears are much better, his claws are growing again and the last wound on his back is almost completely healed. His teeth still need improvement however.

The team wrote that they respect the Agriculture Board's decision to keep Arthur in quarantine for the time being. They also went on to praise the quarantine's staff for doing an 'amazing job' with their new best friend.

The fifth member: Team Peak Performance met Arthur during the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship. He followed the group of four during the grueling race

All terrains: Despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of Arthur, primarily for his own safety, he refused to go. It meant when he got stuck in the knee-deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted, they stopped to take a break

Support: At one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle, so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food

Arthur first met Lindnord in November, as his team were sitting down for a meal that would fuel them through a dangerous 20-mile trek through the Ecuadorian rainforest.  

As he opened his can of meat, a tired Lindnord noticed Arthur, then a scruffy, miserable stray dog,  staring at him out of the corner of his eye.

Feeling sorry for him, he fed Arthur a meatball and thought nothing of it, but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them - and he didn't stop.

As the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship, Arthur befriended them and was eventually given his new name. 

Every grueling task the team face, Arthur would do the same. He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers, dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee-deep mud during treks. 

Determined: Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. But Arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by Lindord

Resting: When the team slept Arthur would also curl up and take a nap alongside them

Encounter:  Lindnord (right) first noticed the scruffy dog when he was sitting down to eat canned meatballs. He fed Arthur one thinking nothing on it, but ended up creating a bond with the dog

Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave. 

This meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out.

After six days the team finished the race, and the dog had suffered. They therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out.

During that time Lindnord thought to himself that after their experience, they could not leave Arthur, so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden. He applied to the Jordbruksverket (the Swedish Board of Agriculture) and was made to wait to see if his application was successful.

After a tense few days, the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home.  

Adventure Racing is a form of extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days. 

Attention: The team let passengers stroke Arthur as he wondered around the airport terminal before their flight back to Sweden where he is still being kept in quarantine 

The world championships held in Ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the Andes, the Pacific and the Amazon rainforest.  

Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety.

They tried to set off without him, but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling. Lindord, heartbroken by the site of Arthur struggling in the water, picked him up, put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey. 

The gesture prompted a standing ovation and cheers from spectators watching from the banks.  

The ordeal to get him back to Sweden was documented on the team's Facebook page. In one post Lindord wrote: 'I almost cried in front of the computer, when receiving the decision from Jordbruksverket (Board of Agriculture) in Sweden!'

'The team is overwhelmed and happy knowing that Jordbruksverket has approved Mikaels application to bring Arthur to Sweden. A big important piece in the work to get Arhur on the plane, is done. So far so good. But, There are [sic] still one paper to go. The team are now working hard for the very last piece in this puzzel [sic].

Lindord ended by saying: 'I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship. Instead, I got a new friend.'
