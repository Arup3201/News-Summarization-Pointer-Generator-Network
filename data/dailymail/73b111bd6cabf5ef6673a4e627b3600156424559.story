A nursery nurse has revealed how she was forced to play dead during a terrifying assault which left her with such shocking injuries her own mother did not recognise her.

Katey Wall thought she was going to die as Matthew Atkins, 25, punched her repeatedly in the head during a brutal assault in the earlier hours of the morning on a dark footpath in Bridgnorth, Shropshire.

And the attractive 24-year-old says even though she pretended to stop breathing, in an attempt to stop the attack, the random assault only ended after a passer-by further down the path spooked Atkins.

Brutal: Miss Wall was unrecognisable to her own mother after she was brutally attacked (right) but is now on the road to recovery following  the unprovoked 10 minute onslaught from Matthew Atkins

The horrific assault, on July 30 last year, left the blonde bleeding so heavily that her own mother didn’t recognise her when she got out of the ambulance - and those on the scene after the onslaught said the footpath looked like someone had been stabbed.

Speaking about the horrendous ordeal, which lasted a staggering 10 minutes, Katey said 'I wasn’t aware anyone was following me. I heard a couple of footsteps and someone put their hand over my mouth from behind but I thought it was someone I knew having a laugh.

'When I turned around I realised I didn’t know him and he kept his hand over my mouth and was pinching my nose.

'It was a struggle at first, I was throwing my arms everywhere and screaming but he had his hand over my mouth. It felt like quite a few minutes before I went to the floor.

'I was face down and he was using my hair to bash my head on the floor really hard. I thought that was it, I thought I was going to die.

Thug: Matthew Atkins arrives at Shrewsbury Crown Court where he admitted to unlawfully and maliciously wounding Katey Wall with intent to do her grievous bodily harm, following the hearing he was remanded in custody

'So I thought maybe if I play dead and stop breathing, he might go away. He was listening for my breathing and eventually I let out a gasp, and he kept on banging my head off the floor.'

Luckily for the nursery nurse, Atkins ran off when he heard footsteps further up the popular pathway - leaving a barely conscious Katey to die.

'Someone came along the path and he must’ve heard them or seen them and ran away,' she added.

'It was 30 seconds before I realised he had gone. I got up and tried to run away but I was nearly unconscious so I kept falling to the floor.

'All I remember is saying ‘I have been attacked’ to someone and luckily just up the road is an ambulance station so they were ready.'

Katey was rushed to Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford, where she had nine stitches to wounds on the back of her head.

'Because I had so much banging to the head I had nine stitches to the back of my head and they had to keep me in for 48 hours for observation,' said Katey, who lives at her home with her parents in Bridgnorth.

'My hair was exactly the same colour as it is now but when they opened the ambulance doors my own mum didn’t even recognise me. My hair was completely red.

'There was a lot of blood. It looked like someone had been stabbed there.'

Despite describing herself as 'strong', Katey refuses to go out in the dark on her own since the terrifying ordeal - which gave her nightmares for months.

And the brave 24-year-old says she believes the only reason Atkins didn’t fatally injure her is because she put up a fight.

'He wasn’t a lot bigger than myself but he was more powerful,' she added.

'I think it went on for ten minutes. My 
bag was over my shoulder which would have been easy to take but nothing 
was missing from it.

Court: Atkins admitted to assaulting Miss Wall at Shrewsbury Crown Court and is expected back at the same court in a couple of weeks for sentencing

'At the time I only thought that he was trying to kill me. I think because I put up such a fight, he was spooked a bit.

'I was having really bad nightmares and I was scared to go out in the dark. I won’t go out in the dark on my own anymore, it’s changed my life in that way.'

Atkins, of Telford, Shropshire admitted unlawfully and maliciously wounding Miss Wall with intent to do her grievous bodily harm at Shrewsbury Crown Court this week.

Judge Peter Barrie adjourned the case for reports and further psychiatric evidence until March 13.

Atkins was remanded in custody.
