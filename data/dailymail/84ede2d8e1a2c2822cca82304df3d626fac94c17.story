It’s the kind of transformation you only see in fairy tales. A grim-looking woman’s hooked nose shrinks to reveal the reflection of a fresh-faced beauty.

Elsewhere, a flat-chested blonde gains confidence from her curvy new shape.

However watchdogs have ruled that the scenes – in a TV advert for cosmetic surgery – are only suitable for adults.

Reflection: The advert for The Hospital Group shows a woman unhappy with her nose, left, who is then delighted by its sudden transformation

Viewers complained the commercial for The Hospital Group was irresponsible and harmful to impressionable youngsters.

The ad - which also showed a man with crooked teeth - led to 36 complaints from viewers.

They claimed it trivialised cosmetic surgery, implied surgical procedures ‘made you happy’ and said it would make children worry they were ‘unattractive’ and didn’t have the ‘perfect appearance’.

The majority of those who complained said the advert, which was shown from 6.45pm, should not have been aired before 9pm as it would give children a ‘negative impact on their body image’.

The ad showed three people whose lives were ‘transformed’ by cosmetic surgery.

The first shows a a woman looking in a make-up mirror applying foundation to her nose, which elongates like Pinocchio.

It then shows her ‘after surgery’ with a smaller nose as she mouths ‘Wow’ in the mirror.

A businessman is then shown hiding his mouth with his hand during a presentation to cover up his crooked teeth before seeing an image of ‘how he could look’, with a gleaming smile.

A glum-looking woman wearing a baggy jumper to hide her flat chest is then shown glancing into a shop window as she walks past with her arms ‘crossed tightly across her chest’.

When she looks back into the shop window she sees how ‘she could look’ with a boob job.

Curves: A woman gains a fuller figure after her breast surgery in the advert. The ad led to 36 complaints and the Advertising Standards Authority said it was irresponsible and harmful to children

She then flashes her ‘new large breasts’ in a tight, low-cut red dress as she runs her hands down her new figure.

A voiceover states: 'If you’re unhappy with your appearance you could change it. If it affects your confidence you could overcome it. If it makes you feel self-conscious, you could take control with cosmetic surgery or dentistry from The Hospital Group.'

The three people are then shown ‘transformed’ and ‘admiring their new looks’ with huge smiles on their faces.

On-screen text during the ad stated: 'No surgical procedure is entirely without risk. Subject to consultation. Over 18s only'.

Bosses at the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ad was shown at various times between 6.45pm and 10:45 pm on a number of different TV channels.

The ASA did not uphold the complaint that the ad ‘trivialised cosmetic surgery’ or that it ‘implied that life’s happiness could be achieved through cosmetic surgery’.

It did, however, rule that the ad breached guidelines on when it could be shown and judged it to be irresponsible and harmful to children watching.

'We considered it likely that many young teenagers would identify with such negative feelings about their physical appearance'

Advertising Standards Authority

The ASA said: 'We were concerned that children, and in particular young teenagers, were likely to interpret the ad differently to adult viewers.

'The ad featured three characters who were depicted as unhappy with their appearance.

'The depictions of their sudden physical transformations were accompanied by an instant and dramatic change in their emotional wellbeing.

'We considered it likely that many young teenagers would identify with such negative feelings about their physical appearance.

'We considered the ad’s scenarios were likely to reinforce harmful feelings that those who did not have a ‘perfect’ physical appearance were unattractive and should be self-conscious about their looks, should aspire to a particular ideal of beauty, and that they should take action to change their physical appearance in order to meet that ideal.

'We therefore considered that a scheduling restriction should have been in place to minimise the risk of children, particularly young teenagers, seeing the ad.

'We concluded the ad should have been given a 9pm timing restriction.'

The Hospital Group said the ad showed scenarios that were relevant in everyday life and that a lack of self-confidence was a 'significant factor' in surgery

Bosses at The Hospital Group Healthcare Ltd said the ad showed ‘scenarios that were relevant in everyday life’ and that patients had told it a ‘lack of self confidence’ was a ‘significant factor’ in them getting cosmetic surgery.

Clearcast - which clears ads before they are aired - said each of the people shown represented a ‘valid reason’ why someone might consider cosmetic surgery.

It said: 'The first woman did not like the appearance of her nose and was shown using make-up in an attempt to tone down how it looked, but she did not feel satisfied with this and so opted for cosmetic surgery.

'The man felt physically uncomfortable with how his teeth looked and felt it was affecting his ability to speak whilst presenting to work colleagues.

'The second woman would like to be able to wear clothing that would suit a fuller bust.'
