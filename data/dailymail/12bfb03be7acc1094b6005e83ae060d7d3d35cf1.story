Reinforcements: Staff from bungling firm G4S are believed to have been hired to help detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile (pictured) sex scandal

The company behind a security debacle at last summer's London Olympics is believed to have been drafted in to help detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal.

G4S, the firm that could only partly fulfill its contract to supply security guards at the Games, will reportedly make £250,000 to hire staff to assist police dealing with 'unprecedented workloads' as a result of Operation Yewtree.

Around 20 extra staff are said to be starting 'imminently' to help with the inquiry.

Reed Specialist Recruitment are believed to be recruiting retired detectives from the G4S Policing Solutions arm.

One of Jimmy Savile's victims, Deborah Cogger, told The Sun that she is furious at the decision to hire G4S staff.

She said: 'What will people G4S hire know about child abuse and paedophilia?

'What qualifications do they have to handle sensitive material?'

Ex Met Police commander John O'Connor also branded the move 'appalling'.

A statement issued by the Metropolitan Police said: 'We can confirm SC&O5 are to take on a number of external individuals via Reed Specialist Recruitment to assist with a wide range of work across the command.

'This is in line with the policy of the organisation whereby we may call upon the experience of appropriate external parties to assist with cases where unique and specialist knowledge can enhance the investigation.

'Individuals are selected by the employment agency Reed Specialist Recruitment who hold the contract for the supply of all temporary agency workers.

'Due to the unprecedented current workloads of the command created as a result of the Jimmy Saville inquiry, there is a need to take on additional staff. '

According to the Met, the hired staff will be undertaking a variety of roles and will be security checked before being put forward for roles.

There are currently 30 police officers working in the SC&O5 unit working on Operation Yewtree.

G4S hit the headlines after failing to fulfill its £240million contract with Locog to provide 10,400 security guards at the Olympic Park and other venues.

Reinforcements: The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games

Ready for action: An extra 1,200 troops had to be put on standby during the London Games last summer

The company's failure forced the Government to draft in members of the Armed Forces to help cover gaps.

Both chief Operating Officer David Taylor-Smith and head of global events Ian Horseman Sewell resigned in the wake of the shambles.

G4S is said to have made a loss of around £70million as a result of the fiasco.

A G4S spokesman said: 'The 29,000 candidates on our books are mostly retired, police officers or professionals, with extensive experience of working in investigations.

'They are not employed by G4S; do not report to us; and G4S has no say over their duties, performance or continued employment.

'Candidates are recruited by police forces for their skills and experience. They are not serving police officers and have no police powers.

'They work in support of the police and will always act under the direction of a senior police officer.'

The firm faced another humiliation on Wednesday when it lost its contract to provide guards for a major music festival.

Loss: The company was reportedly at a loss of around £70million following the Olympics security debacle

It is the first time in 17 years the security group has not won its bid to work at the annual two-day V Festival in Staffordshire.

The weekend, which this year features Beyonce, pictured, sees 85,000 revellers flock to Stafford for two days of rock music, mud and sunshine.

Although G4S said that they were 'disappointed' to lose the contract, they insisted that it had nothing to do with the Olympics fiasco.

Reed Specialist Recruitment were unavailable for comment.
