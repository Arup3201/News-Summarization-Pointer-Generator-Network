Nearly one in four people blame their aches and pains on their working environment where they remain in the same position for long periods of time, a new study has revealed.

More than one in six Britons also blame joint pain and back ache on the chair they sit in at work, according to new research.

However, more than a third of Britons who suffer aches and pains believe they are just an inevitable part of ageing.

Nearly one in four people blame their aches and pains on their working environment where they remain in the same position for long periods of time - and one in six think their chair is to blame

The study suggests that people’s aches and pains also cause them trouble outside of work - one in seven Britons say they are less interested in romantic relationships as a result of their pain.

The survey of 1,000 people, aged 25 to 65, with aches and pains was commissioned by the Simplyhealth Advisory Research Panel.

It found that aches and pains associated with the body’s skeleton and muscles are a fact of life for thousands of people in the UK, with back pain affecting four out of five people at some time in their lives.

Aches and pains are estimated to cost the UK £5.7 billion a year and result in 10 million lost working days.

Perhaps worryingly, three in four sufferers do not seek professional help, believing they need a referral from their doctor to see a physiotherapist.

The study identifies that lower back pain is the nation’s number one sore spot with seven in 10 complaining of problems in this area.

It also reveals that those who weigh more than 14 stone are more likely to suffer pain on a daily basis.

Nearly a quarter of back and joint pain sufferers cannot lift heavy items, one in five cannot walk for long periods and nine per cent say pain had such a big impact on their lives that they are unable to play with their children or climb stairs.

The study found that women are more likely to suffer joint pain than men.

One in three women have painful knees compared with one in five men, while 40 per cent of women say their joint problems make them feel old before their time and 28 per cent are depressed and frustrated.

This was compared to 25 per cent of men who say pain makes them feel older and 23 who say it makes them depressed.

Painkillers are the most commonly used treatment for back pain, despite dangers of long-term use, including heart attack, stroke and high blood pressure.

Arthritis is the most common cause of musculoskeletal problems in the UK, with more than 10 million people per year consulting a doctor about it.

Experts say the problem is rising because of the growing issue of obesity in the UK.

Dr Gill Jenkins, a GP on the Simplyhealth Advisory Research Panel, said: ‘Over the counter painkillers can be useful, particularly for acute episodes, but it is not wise to take them for long periods without consulting your GP, particularly if you have other problems.

‘It is important that people with persistent aches and pains discuss their options with their doctor, physiotherapist or other health professional.’

Raman Sankaran, a spokesperson for healthcare provider Simplyhealth, said: ‘While people visit the dentist when they have a toothache or see an optician if their eyesight worsens, 89 per cent of those with pain in their lower back and joints appear reluctant to consult a physiotherapist.’
