These are the  images that show the derelict terrace an elderly woman was living in before she died and went unnoticed on the floor of her bedroom for eight years.

Natalie Jean Wood died aged 86 some time after Christmas in 2003 at her home in Surry Hills, Sydney, but wasn't found until police searched the property in July 2011.

Her tragic and lonely death was the subject of a NSW Coroner's Court inquest last year and these images, which have only recently been released, were shown to reveal the dilapidated conditions Ms Wood was living in, ninemsn reports.

The war bride and David Jones machinist was last seen on December 30, 2003 when she visited a chemist for a prescription for high-blood pressure.

The box of medication was found alongside Ms Wood's belongings when her skeletal remains were found in 2011.

A pair of gold earrings, a pair of reading glasses in its case, a walking stick and two pieces of clothing were also found. 

The photos inside her home showed make-up, a watch, scissors and a 2003 diary on top of some dust-covered drawers in her bedroom.

Two rings and a set of pink dentures were found where Ms Wood's remains were located. 

Her bedroom contained two wardrobes, a mirrored dresser and a queen bed frame, but no mattress was found. 

Photos show weathered wallpaper and fallen gyprock around the house, as well as inch thick dust, leaves and fraying carpet. 

Canned food and coffee well past its used-by-date were also located by police.  

In her front room, two rotting arms chairs were found alongside a two-seater lounge.

Despite her decomposing body lying on the floor of her home for eight years, no one raised an alarm to say she was missing. 

Ms Wood's electricity and water providers, as well as the Department of Human Services who deposited her pension, failed to raise the alarm. 

Her neighbours thought she had gone to live with her brother. 

The coroner ruled last year that Ms Wood's death did not require further investigations by organisations to ensure something like this didn't happen again to elderly or vulnerable clients.
