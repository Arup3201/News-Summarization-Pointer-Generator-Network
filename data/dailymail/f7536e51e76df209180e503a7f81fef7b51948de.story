It has been more than 200 years since the French managed to land an invading naval force on Britain's shores.

But today saw hundreds of armed troops along with 43 vehicles, four helicopters, two landing craft and a catamaran, stormed a beach in Gosport, Hampshire.

The sight would have been the stuff of nightmares for Admiral Lord Nelson as scores of Frenchmen emerged from the sea clutching their rifles.

But far from being a serious assault on the scale of a Napoleonic invasion, this was a unique training exercise for the French military.

The last time French troops landed on British soil was during the Battle of Fishguard - also known as the 'last invasion of Britain' - in 1797.

Today's exercise signalled the first time French forces have trained using a UK beach, signalling the ever-closer co-operation between London and Paris in the wake of the 2010 defence treaty signed by David Cameron and ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy.

The task force landed at Browndown camp in Gosport, Hampshire, which was part-built by French prisoners of war during the early 19th century.

The amphibious landing helicopter ship, FS Tonnerre, and its anti-submarine warfare destroyer, FS Georges Leygues, conducted exercises out in the Solent from 2pm while aircraft buzzed in the grey skies overhead.

Speaking ahead of the invasion, a French navy spokeswoman said: 'Once the vehicles and soldiers disembark, using the landing craft and helicopters, the troops will continue with instruction activities, driver training, live fire exercises and assault course on Browndown.

'This kind of manoeuvre is a unique chance for the 134 midshipmen of the French Naval Academy 2010-class embarked onboard the Tonnerre and the Georges Leygues to discover both amphibious and joint operations.'

After their stay on the south coast, the roving task force will travel to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, where they will take part in an European anti-piracy operation before visiting Chinese waters.

The last time French troops landed on British soil was during the Battle of Fishguard - also known as the 'last invasion of Britain' - in 1797.

The invasion was the plan of French General Lazare Hoche, who had devised a three-pronged attack on Britain in support of Irish Republicans under Wolfe Tone. Two forces would land in Britain as a diversionary effort, while the main body would land in Ireland.

While poor weather and indiscipline halted two of the forces, the third, aimed at landing in Wales and marching on Bristol, went ahead.

The invasion force consisted of 1,400 troops from the La Legion Noire (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel William Tate, 800 of whom were irregulars.

Transported on four French warships under the command of Commodore Jean-Joseph Castagnier, Tate's forces landed at Carregwastad Head near Fishguard on 22 February.

Upon landing discipline broke down amongst the irregulars, many of whom deserted to loot nearby settlements.

The remaining troops were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British reservists, militia and sailors under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor.

After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor's forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an unconditional surrender by 24 February.

Later, the British captured two of the expedition's vessels, a frigate and a corvette. Despite all this, Castagnier managed to return to France.
