The wife of Slipknot bassist Paul Gray has detailed his dark descent into drug addiction - that ultimately led to his death - during her testimony in the manslaughter trial of his doctor.

Speaking in court in Polk County, Iowa on Tuesday, Brenna Gray said after her husband became hooked back on drugs in 2008, she would regularly find him passed out in their home or discover used needles stashed away. He suffered a fatal overdose in a motel room in 2010, aged 38.

She gave the gripping testimony during the trial of Dr Daniel Baldi, who faces nine counts of involuntary 
manslaughter stemming from the deaths of Gray and eight others.

Prosecutors claim the deaths followed Baldi's careless prescription habits - but he denies this, while his lawyer has pointed out that Gray did not overdose on any drugs prescribed by Baldi.

Testimony: Brenna Gray, in court on Tuesday, testified in the manslaughter trial of her husband's doctor, who is accused of carelessly prescribing addictive drugs. Gray's husband was the bassist of Slipknot

Emotional: When the doctor's attorney pointed out that her husband died of drugs that his client had not prescribed, Mrs Gray became emotional and admitted her husband was to blame

But Mrs Gray said that Baldi continued to prescribe Xanax to her husband even after she told the doctors of her concerns about the drug, which Gray had a history of abusing.

'I just knew it was his drug of choice, 
that he'd struggled with it. So I just wasn't really sure why he was on 
it, why he needed it along with the medication he was taking for 
addiction,' she said.

She said that as he descended further into addiction, she desperately appealed for help from his bandmates and Dr Baldi - but no one helped.

She claimed that she took photos of her husband slumped over and showed them to Dr Baldi, and told him about the needles she found in their home, but the doctor continued to prescribe Xanax.

Baldi's attorney, Gus Cook, noted that there was no note of her sharing these with the doctor in her husband's medical records.

'A lot of things weren't noted in there,' she said, adding that other details were kept from her.

'I also was told that he had passed his drugs test, and I didn't find out it was positive until Paul had passed away,' she told the court. 'And that he had been testing positive for quite a few times and still leaving with a prescription of Xanax.'

After she and other relatives staged an intervention to confront Gray about his drug abuse, her husband fled to the TownePlace Suites hotel, she said.

Mrs Gray said she didn't call police in case they found drugs she and her husband had in the house, and she also feared social services would take away her unborn child. Their daughter, October, was born after he passed away.

And when she called her husband's bandmates, none would help, she said.

'Nobody else cared, nobody was involved,' she said. 'They told me it was my problem.'

But two days later, he was found dead from painkillers fentanyl and morphine.

Baldi's attorney Guy Cook asked Mrs Gray if she was aware that the doctor had not prescribed these drugs to her husband.

She also conceded that Baldo had seemed genuinely interested in helping her husband get off drugs and had 'finally' reduced his Xanax doses months before he died.

'You understand, do you not, ma'am, that if Paul got the morphine and the fentanyl on the street somewhere, that it's nobody's fault except Mr Gray or the person he got it from?' Cook asked.

Scene: Gray was 38 and about to welcome his first child when he died in an Iowa motel in 2010

Mrs Gray became emotional as she responded: 'I don't know where he got them... It's a hypothetical question. It's not fair.'

But as her questioning finished, she admitted that she had said in her deposition: 'It's nobody's fault, but Mr, Gray's. That's correct, that's what I said.'

If convicted, Baldi could face up to 18 years in prison.

Gray, a founding member of the heavy-metal band Slipknot, died of a drug overdose in May 2010. He was found after Gray's mother called the hotel earlier that day, concerned no one could reach him.Staff broke open the door and found him dead inside.

His bandmates Corey Taylor and Shawn Crahan are listed as potential witnesses in the trial.
