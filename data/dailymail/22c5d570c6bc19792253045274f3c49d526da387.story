New York City has begun a new attempt of sifting through debris of the World Trade Center to find human remains from the 9/11 attacks after outcry from victims' families who still have nothing to bury.

The work began Monday. It's expected to continue for about 10 weeks at the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island.

Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway said in a memo on Friday that DNA testing will continue until every possible victim identification can be made.

City officials say about 60 truckloads of construction debris have been collected around the site over the past two and a half years.

Some 2,750 people died at the World Trade Center in the 2001 attacks carried out by al Qaeda terrorists who crashed hijacked airliners into the buildings.

So far, 1,634 people have been positively identified.

The Medical Examiner's office has 
identified remains of 1,634 people, leaving more than 1,000 families
without any physical remains of their loved ones who perished.

After the initial cleanup of the site,
the city scaled back operations to search for remains, drawing 
criticism from families of the dead, who said they could not properly 
grieve.

The city widened its search again in 2006.

The next search will comb through 590 cubic yards (451 cubic meters) of excavated material taken from and near the World Trade Center site.

CNN reported that the city will implement a new sifting method at the landfill.

Much of the site known as Ground Zero is a construction zone for new skyscrapers and a memorial where the twin towers once stood.

The building under construction known as One World Trade Center has surpassed the Empire State Building as the tallest in New York and, when completed, would be the tallest in the Western Hemisphere at 1,776 feet.
