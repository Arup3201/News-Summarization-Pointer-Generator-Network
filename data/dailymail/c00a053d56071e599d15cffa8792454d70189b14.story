One evacuee has raised questions
 about the experience asking did they want 'to save the gene pool?'

Yale University has been accused of trying to create a super race of British children during War World Two, it emerged today.

The university offered to evacuate children of Oxford University staff in 1940, but it appears there could have been a sinister motive behind their seemingly kind offer.

There are now concerns that leaders of the eugenics movement at Yale University may have extended the invitation because they planned to repopulate a devastated Britain with a race of intellectually superior children.

Hidden motive: Accusations have emerged that when a U.S. university offered refuge to 125 children of Oxford University staff during World War Two, there was a sinister motive (file pic)

'Was Yale hoping to save the offspring of the British academic elite,
 protecting those 125 children because it saw them as future leadership
 class, especially deserving of preservation?' asks Jonathan Freedland in The Sunday Telegraph. 

As the threat of invasion loomed and the terror of Nazi bombs continued, Yale University sent a letter to both Oxford and Cambridge universities, offering children of their fellows and dons evacuation refuge in the U.S.

Calling itself the Yale Faculty Committee for Receiving Oxford and Cambridge University Children, 125 Oxford children and 35 mothers took up the offer, boarding the SS Antonia from Liverpool to New Haven, Connecticut on 8 July 1940.

The children missed their parents, but enjoyed the new world they have found themselves immersed in.

They found the American classrooms less rigid than English schooling and reveled in new experiences during their five year stay.

Ann Spokes-Symonds who was evacuated with her younger brother, describes the trip as 'the camaraderie between educated people' 'that connected two prestigious universities,' reported The Sunday Telegraph.

But Juliet Hopkins, who was also evacuated, and thoroughly enjoyed her time at Yale, has raised questions about the experience asking did they want 'to save the gene pool?'

Yale University only offered refuge to Oxford and Cambridge, but Cambridge rejected the offer, concerned that 'this might be interpreted as a privilege for a special class,' reported The Sunday Telegraph.

Evacuee Juliet Hopkins discovered that the man who had taken in her family, Ellsworth Huntingdon, was not only the Professor of Geography at Yale - he was also the former president of the American Eugenics Society

Dr John Fulton of Yale Medical School 
was a driving force behind the rescue and said the committee 'hoped to 
save some of the children of intellectuals before the storm breaks.'

In the pre-war period, the idea that society should aim to breed a better quality of human stock was popular -  those who were deemed intellectually superior were encouraged to have more children, and those with a lesser intellect were urged to have less offspring.

Charles Darwin's son Leonard, saw the human race as no different to animals and similarly, 'weak' humans should not be encourage to breed.

This suggest that before the war Yale was captured by an idea which seems uncomfortably close to Nazism.

Gaddis Smith, Emeritus Professor of History at Yale, describes Yale's president James Angell, who ruled in 1937, as 'a fanatic eugenicist in the worst meaning of that word.' 

He also said the university was anti-Semitic at that time and has seen documents that there was discomfort when it emerged a mother of one of the Oxford evacuees was 'a Jewess.'

Mr Freeland used the story as a backdrop of his new novel Pantheon, and once his book was finished, he sent a copy to Juliet Hopkins.

She discovered that, the man who had taken in her family, Ellsworth Huntingdon, and paid for their private education out of his own pocket was not only the Professor of Geography at Yale - he was also the former president of the American Eugenics Society.
