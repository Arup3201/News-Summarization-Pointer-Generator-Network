IT was lucky for Karen Dean that she wasn’t in the mood for a spot of sunbathing  yesterday morning.For just before 11am, a light aircraft fell out of the sky and crashed into her back garden.

Both she and the 76-year-old pilot had miraculous escapes after the Cirrus SR22 hit the ground.

Fortunately the 200mph aircraft’s fall was slowed by an emergency parachute – and then cushioned by Mrs Dean’s conifer trees.

Miracle: The pilot managed to release a parachute in time which allowed his plane to float to safety

Aftermath: The parachute can be seen in the back garden of the house in Cheltenham

Wreckage: The single engine crashed into this back garden in Cheltenham this morning

Relieved: Karen Dean and Mike in their back garden where a plane crashed this morning

The unnamed pilot was able to stumble
from the wreckage with only minor injuries, and a relieved Mrs Dean 
spoke of her shock and relief that catastrophe was avoided.

The plane even managed to avoid her greenhouse, summer house and shed.

The 50-year-old mother of two was inside her £250,000 semi-detached home in Cheltenham when she heard a ‘whirring sound’.

‘It got louder and louder and then I 
thought all hell was breaking loose,’ she said. ‘I ran into my garden 
and there was this huge plane.

The parachute caught in trees after the single-engine aircraft made a dramatic crash-landing in a back garden in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

‘The pilot clambered out and was walking around a bit dazed. I was in shock. I was so scared.’

Mrs Dean, a project manager for 
Boots, was working from home yesterday. She joked of the damage done to 
the property: ‘That was the only part of my garden that we had done up, 
so I’m a touch annoyed that it’s wrecked now.

‘If they let me keep the plane, which they won’t, it would make an incredible water feature. Charlie Dimmock would be jealous.’

Neighbour Jeannie Bowers, 46, added: 
‘There was a big pop and banging sound and then a whoosh of air. The 
parachute went up and the plane slowly came down towards the ground 
gently turning and hanging from this parachute.

David Shatford was working on an extension at the house when the plane crashed

Ruined: The plane which crashed is believed to be worth around £500,000

Destruction zone: David Shatford was working on the house at the time of the crash and pulled to pilot out of the plane to safety

Lucky escape: The plane landed in a back garden belonging to Karen Dean and her husband Mike

‘It just gently came down and landed on the conifers in Karen’s garden.’

The Cirrus aircraft, worth around 
£200,000, was written off in the crash which left one wing almost 
completely torn away and the other bent at a 90-degree angle at the tip.

Emergency services were at the scene 
in minutes and took the pilot to hospital, but it is understood he 
suffered only minor injuries.

He was helped from the wreckage by builder David Shatford, 30, who was working on a nearby property.

He said: ‘I looked around and saw 
this plane coming straight towards me. It was about ten feet away and I 
had to jump off the scaffolding.

‘Next thing I knew the plane had smashed into the trees.’

The pilot, from London, was heading 
for Gloucestershire Airport at Staverton, which sent  its Rescue and 
Fire Fighting Service to the scene to make the plane safe.

Crash: Emergency services inspect the scene where a plane crashed this morning in Gloucestershire

Lucky escape: The pilot was forced to deploy the parachute of the light-aircraft which floated to safety

His soft landing came courtesy of the
aircraft’s Cirrus Airframe Parachute System – an emergency device which
has been credited with saving at least 70 lives.

Records show the aircraft was built in 2008 and is registered through Southern Aircraft Consultancy in Suffolk.

No one from the firm was available for comment.

In the event of an emergency, the pilot pulls a red chord which is in the ceiling of the cockpit.Once the chord is pulled a solid-fuel rocket is deployed out of a hatch which covers the compartment where the parachute is stored.As the rocket carries the parachute rearward from the back of the plane, harness straps are released.Within seconds, the 65inch diameter canopy unfolds which begins to control the plane's descent.According to Nick Tarratt, UK agent for Cirrus, pilots have only had to deploy the parachute a handful of times worldwide.He said: 'The aircraft is the only production aircraft to have a parachute built in.'The idea came from the plane's designers, brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier after Alan had a mid-air collision.'It inspired them to produce an aircraft with a built in parachute.'It is a real success story, because this man has been able to walk away alive.'

The pilot deployed the parachute attached to the plane with a harness. The canopy allowed the plane to descend at a slower speed before reaching the ground. The nose wheel would normally hit the ground first
