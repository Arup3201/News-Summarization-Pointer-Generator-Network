Told off: Osteopath Paul Bolton regularly left patients unattended, a panel was told 

An osteopath left acupuncture needles sticking out of a patient's backside while he nipped off to a café for sausage rolls, a disciplinary panel was told.

Paul Bolton regularly left patients unattended and told a colleague who challenged him that he would ‘strangle her slowly and watch her eyeballs pop out’, it heard.

The British former soldier and police officer was fined £1,500 by the medical authorities in New Zealand over the alleged litany of misconduct and banned from practising for 12 months.

However he has since returned home and is advertising services including acupuncture, massage and spinal manipulation.

Mr Bolton spent six months working as an osteopath at the Consultancy House Clinic in Dunedin during which there were ‘seven or eight’ complaints from patients, New Zealand’s Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal was told.

A massage therapist at the clinic told the tribunal he would often see clients lying unattended on the treatment table with acupuncture needles in their back.

He described one morning when he saw Mr Bolton walk up the stairs with a cup of coffee and a bag full of sausage rolls even though he had a patient on the table ‘with a backside full of needles hooked up to the Tens (electro-acupuncture) machine’.

He was also said to have jammed needles into a woman's back without warning, putting holes in her t-shirt, and carrying out a strong neck manipulation that left her sore for six months.

When clinic managers began to realise he left clients unattended, he was challenged, but he ‘just yelled and screamed’ and refused to talk about it, the hearing was told.

The clinic told the tribunal Mr Bolton was ‘aggressive with his patients, was intimidating towards his patients, swore and was too loud’, with two colleagues saying they could hear all his conversations with clients through the concrete walls.

The tribunal heard numerous evidence of Mr Bolton's ‘excessively inappropriate foul language’, and how he spent more time talking about himself than engaging with his patients, answering his mobile phone and having personal conversations.

When he was confronted for using foul language by one office manager he allegedly ‘called her a 'f***ing c***’.

One colleague said Mr Bolton ‘would typically start the sentence with a 'f***' finish it with a 'f***' and have a 'f***' somewhere in the middle of it. He would frequently use the words 'f***' and 'c***' as part of a normal conversation’.

The HPDT ruled that his ‘use of bad language ... is unprofessional and brings discredit to the osteopathy profession’.

It had come to the ‘distinct conclusion that Mr Bolton is a large man with a loud voice and an intimidating manner’, who had told a colleague he wanted to ‘strangle (another colleague) slowly and watch her eyeballs pop out’.

Ruling that he had brought discredit to his profession in his stint there in 2011-12, it said he had put patients at ‘significant risk’ by leaving them alone while they had acupuncture needles inserted, particularly when electro-acupuncture was being used.

It suspended him from practising for 12 months, fined him $3000 (£1,490) and ordered him to pay $45,714 (£22,700) towards the costs of the investigation and hearing.

Mr Bolton misspelled his place of work,  has since been working at Carlisle Complementary Therapies – misspelt as ‘complimentary’ on his personal website

Mr Bolton has since been working at Carlisle Complementary Therapies – misspelt as ‘complimentary’ on his personal website – but staff there said yesterday he had been an independent practitioner who was no longer running clinics there.

According to the site he offers acupuncture, massage, ‘spinal manipulation’ and exercise advice, charging £50-an-hour.

It says that after serving with the Royal Engineers and stints on drilling rigs and with the police he found his ‘true vocation’ studying sports therapy, later training as an osteopath and working with top rugby and football clubs.

His biography states: ‘In 2010 I fulfilled a personal dream and worked for two years in the South Island NZ as an Osteopath to the local sporting community and farming communities.’

A woman at his family home in Carlisle declined to comment yesterday, and messages left on the phone number on his website were not returned.

A spokeswoman for Britain’s General Osteopathic Council said Mr Bolton was not registered as an osteopath in this country and therefore not entitled to practise using the term.

It added that it was in touch with its counterpart in New Zealand and would take the findings of its investigation into account should he seek to register here.
