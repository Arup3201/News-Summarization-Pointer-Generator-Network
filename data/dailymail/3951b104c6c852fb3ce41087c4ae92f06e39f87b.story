A Kansas teenager and his biological mother have been charged with shooting dead the boy’s adoptive mother and critically injuring his adoptive father outside the couple’s home.

Anthony Bluml, 18, and Kisha Schaberg, 35, were two of the four people arrested earlier this month in the case.

All were charged in a six-count criminal complaint with first-degree murder in the death of Bluml’s adopted mother, 53-year-old Melissa Bluml, as well as attempted first-degree murder of Roger Bluml, who survived a gunshot to the head.

They also were charged with aggravated robbery, burglary and theft counts related to a purse, cellphone, coins and other property stolen worth less than $1,000 from the home.

Melissa Bluml died the day after the November 15 shooting at their home in rural Valley Center, which is north of Wichita.

Police have yet to determine the motive behind the murder, but a relative said that Anthony Bluml was apparently unhappy living in the home of his adoptive family. 

The four suspects in the case made their first court appearances Monday via video conference at Sedgwick County District Court. All four were charged with identical counts and the criminal complaint does not indicate who actually fired the shots.

A preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 10, although that setting is expected to be continued to a later date.

Anthony Bluml is being held on a $500,000 bond and ordered to have no communication with his adoptive father or other state witnesses. Bond for Schaberg, of San Diego, was set at $1million.

Also charged in the case are Andrew Ellington and Branden Smith, both 18, of Park City. The two are being held on $500,000 bond.

Melissa Bluml, a vice president at Chisholm Trail State Bank, was remembered in her obituary as ‘a loving wife and encouraging mother.’

Mourners packed a Wichita-area church Friday for her burial mass in which the local priest extolled the congregation not to try to understand evil.

The Wichita Eagle reported that Anthony Bluml met his biological mother two months ago in San Diego, after first communicating with her through Facebook. He and a younger brother, Chris, had been adopted by the Blumls as young children.

Earlier this month, Schaberg posted a photo on her Facebook page depicting her and Anthony with the tagline, ‘Bond that can’t be broken.’

Anthony Bluml, Ellington and Smith all attended Valley Central High School, where Schaberg's son was a star wrestler and also played on the football team.

Authorities got a 911 call at around 9.15pm November 15 about a shooting outside the home of Melissa and Roger Bluml near 109th Street North and Woodlawn in rural Sedgwick County.

Officers who responded to the scene discovered the couple shot in their car parked on their property. The Blumls were rushed to an area hospital, where the wife succumbed to her injuries the following day.

Roger Bluml remains in critical condition after reportedly being shot in the head.

Anne Carter-Hainlen described the Blumls to Kansas City Star as great parents who were very involved in their adopted sons’ lives and never missed a sporting event.

Anthony was picked up by police two hours later on an unrelated traffic charge and released Saturday after posting $2,500 bond.

A day after the shooting, Anthony posted a message on his Twitter account that read: 'Dear mama, ill [sic] love you forever.'

The 18-year-old was rearrested along with his three alleged accomplices in the murder case last Tuesday and booked into jail the following day.

Anthony Bluml pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct and was fined $100.

Schaberg, a native of Pasadena, California, moved from Missouri to San Diego three years ago after leaving the father of her 7-year-old daughter.

According to her former stepdaughter, 20-year-old Victoria Egerer, Schaberg reconnected with her biological son recently on Facebook and met face to face with him for the first time in years, the Wichita Eagle reported.  

Egerer said her former stepmother told her that her son did not like living with the Blumls because they were too strict and didn't let him do whatever he wanted.

Tony's younger brother, Chris, who is a high school junior, did not want to have a relationship with Schaberg, leading her to believe that Melissa Bluml and her husband had turned her son against her, Egerer said.

Bluml began staying with his mother in California about two months ago. The two were joined by Schaberg's younger daughter and another man, and all of them lived in the home of Schaberg's girlfriend.

Schaberg and her partner later had a falling out over money, and the 35-year-old took her children to a hotel, where she allegedly slept with Tony in the same bed, according to Egerer.

About three weeks ago, Schaberg informed her former stepdaughter that she was moving to Kansas along with her son and 7-year-old daughter.

Following Schaberg’s arrest, the child has been taken into protective custody.
