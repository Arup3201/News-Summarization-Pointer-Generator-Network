KFC has opened its kitchens to the public to reveal a behind-the-scenes look at how the company cooks its finger lickin' food.

More than 160 Australian stores offered a sneak peak on Saturday, and the details of what goes in to your three-piece meal, zinger meal or plain chicken legs are likely to shock you - for the better.

The fast food giant still wouldn't reveal the ingredients of its 11 secret herbs and spices but did show off how its poultry was cooked from scratch.

The comprehensive tours were an opportunity for the 2000 Australian participants to 'discover for themselves how a genuine working kitchen operates' Chief Marketing and Development Officer at KFC Australia Nikki Lawson said.

Inside the Mascot store in Sydney's south, the topic on everyone's tongues was, of course, the chicken.

The group of three Canadian nationals and one Australian all had the same preconceived idea that KFC chicken is 'naturally frozen.'

'Naturally, you just expect it to be frozen,' tour participant Darren Zomar said.

But behind freezer door one was a temperature controlled storage unit stocked with fresh produce 'the same, exact product you would buy at any Coles or Woolworths,' store manager Ben Sondermeyer said.

All chicken is dated and bagged in colour coded plastic to distinguish between the different cuts, and to also ensure that their is no cross contamination between 'marinated and original' pieces.

Delivered fresh from the storage unit, each original piece of chicken is prepared in flour and seasoned before being cooked for exactly 12 minutes and 40 seconds

Marinated zinger fillets are left to sit overnight in a designated cool room before they're cooked in a similar fashion.

If any piece of chicken is not eaten in 90 minutes after being cooked, it's thrown out.

'90 minutes is the longest time it will sit before it is discarded,' Mr Sondermeyer said.

The participants on the tour said they expected all the chicken to be frozen, and not fresh

Mrs Lawson said the KFC Open Kitchens Day was a chance to provide 'transparency' into the operations of the business.

'We could have produced a beautiful TV ad,' she said. 'But it feels like a this is something consumers wanted and something we are prepared to give to them.'

She said KFC has one of the most rigorous health and safety procedures in the world when it comes to cooking chicken, and felt people were misguided by the belief all its food was 'frozen.'

'To be perfectly honest as an industry we are genuinely proud and I think we have some unique things in KFC,' she said.

Canadian national Darren Zomar felt let down he couldn't find the answer to the age-old recipe known to produce that famous KFC taste.

'Are we going to find out the 11 herbs and spices are?' he said.

But Mr Sondermeyer assured him that there were only two people alive today who know what is in the tightly sealed recipe packs which are manufactured in the US and shipped offshore.

Mrs Lawson added: 'They're two people in the US who work in product development.'

At the completion of the each of the members were treated to their very own freshly cooked meal
