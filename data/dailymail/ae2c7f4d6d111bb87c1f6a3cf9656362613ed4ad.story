It might sound like a plot from ITV's Mr Selfridge but for one couple from Grimsby, life really has proved more interesting than art.

Mike Sutton, 67, and Gill Pickett, 64, first met and fell in love almost 50 years ago while working at a department store but drifted apart and ended up living 4,000 miles away from each other.

After years without contact, fate brought the former teenage sweethearts back together and they have now rekindled their romance and plan to marry.

Reunited: Mike Sutton and Gill Pickett were separated for almost 50 years but will finally marry in April

The pair, who first met while working at the 
Lawson & Stockdale department store in Grimsby in Lincolnshire in the 
mid-1960s, initially dated for 18 months but lost touch after Mike left the store.

In the years that followed, Mike married another woman and in 1971 emigrated to Canada, where they had one daughter and Mike worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Gill, meanwhile, stayed in Grimsby, got married and raised three children of her own, Craig, Lee and Donna.

Despite criss-crossing the Atlantic several times - Mike to visit relatives in Grimsby, Gill to see friends in Canada - the former lovers' paths didn't cross again until April last year.

By this time Gill had separated from her husband while Mike’s wife Jacqueline had passed away three years earlier.

The couple were separated by over 4,000 miles for nearly half a century

But fate was about to take a hand in the shape of a stranger who stopped Mike in the street while he was visiting Grimsby his sister Pamela Borman’s 80th birthday celebrations.

It turned out the man was Derek Wood, a fellow Grimsby expat living in Canada whose wife was Gill’s best friend.

He revealed that Gill had tried to track down Mike while staying with them in Canada the previous year.

Phone numbers were exchanged, Mike and Gill arranged to meet up, and their romance was rekindled.

'Gill called me, I phoned her back, we went for a coffee at the Rose And Crown, went for dinner at the Kingsway and the rest, as they say, is history,' revealed Mike.

'I thought it would be nice to reconnect and see what had been going on in her life, but getting married was the last thing on my mind.

'It was amazing to see her again. She is a lovely individual and she really hasn’t changed in all those years.'

Gill said: 'It was just lovely meeting up with him and it’s been fantastic ever since. It’s as if all those years have gone away.

'We are both getting on a bit and decided there was no time to waste. He is the man of my dreams.

'I did try to find Mike the year before because my best friend lives just outside Toronto and we were going over to the Rockies.

'I knew somebody in Grimsby who knew him and I knew he lived in Edmonton, but Edmonton is a big place.'

Mike and Gill’s wedding will be held at the Oaklands Hall Hotel in Laceby in Lincolnshire on April 20, and following the wedding, Gill will move to Canada, with her daughter Donna, 32, to be with Mike.

Grandmother of seven Gill, who works at Morrisons said: 'It is a lovely place. I used to joke to the girls that if I met a nice Canadian I wouldn’t be coming back. I never dreamed that it would happen.'
