Bill Cosby is planning to perform in Colorado this weekend despite expected protests and a new allegation of sexual misconduct which has launched a police probe.

The comedian released a statement on Thursday thanking his 'courageous' fans and saying he's ready to perform in Pueblo on Friday and at Denver's Buell Theater on Saturday, his first gigs in the U.S. this year.

He finished his statement with references to his 'Fat Albert' character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special: 'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.'

Bill Cosby performs  in Melbourne, Florida on November 21 last year. It was one of the few tour dates that was honored amid dozens of cancellations by venues and fans following sexual assault allegations that have emerged against the TV star

The 77-year-old comedian is facing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. 

He has denied the allegations through his lawyer and has never been charged.

In the most recent allegation, a model claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.

Chloe Goins met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges against the comedian over the incident almost seven years ago. 

Bill Cosby released this statement to The Denver Post: 'Dear Fans: I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful. 

'I'm ready!... I thank you, the theatre staff, the event organizers and the Colorado Community for your continued support and coming to experience family, fun entertainment.... 

'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.'

An attorney for Miss Goins said after the meeting that his client is the first woman accusing Cosby of sexual misconduct whose case may fall within the statute of limitations.

More than 15 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, including several who say the comedian drugged and raped them in incidents dating back at least four decades.

Goins did not speak during a press conference Wednesday. Her attorney, Spencer Kuvin, said she came forward after hearing about other women describing abuse by Cosby and realizing she might have a valid criminal case.

Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, did not immediately return requests for comment this week. 

Mr Kuvin declined to discuss what Miss Goins told detectives but restated her allegations that Cosby drugged her at a 2008 event at the Playboy Mansion. 

The model does not know what happened while she was blacked out but Mr Kuvin says she awoke to find herself naked and Cosby over her.

'Ms. Goins and I are here for two reasons: for justice and accountability,' Kuvin said.

Miss Goins is at least the second woman to meet with Los Angeles police detectives to recount accusations against Cosby.

Prosecutors rejected filing charges against Cosby based on allegations by Judy Huth, a Riverside County resident who is suing the comedian, alleging he abused her in the early 1970s when she was 15 years old. Huth's lawsuit states the abuse happened at the Playboy Mansion.

Los Angeles police Commander Andrew Smith said that he could not confirm any investigation into Cosby and that sex abuse cases are 'extremely confidential'.

Neither Smith nor Kuvin would speculate on what charges Cosby might face, and both noted that the statute of limitations for sex offenses are complex and depend on the facts of a case.

Cosby's attorney has denied some of the accusations against the comedian, saying they have been discredited or come from discredited accusers. 

Cosby joked about the allegations against him at a recent show in Canada.

'We hope that the people that are paying to attend Mr. Cosby's shows understand that these victimized women have broken their silence now and they will not remain quiet any longer,' Kuvin said. 

'Mr. Cosby should, and will be held accountable for what he's done.'

He said women reporting abuse 'should be encouraged and not joked about'.
