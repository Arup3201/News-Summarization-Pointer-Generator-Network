Daniel Devlin lives in the same house as his children and sees them every day – yet he is unable to recognise them at all. 

Mr Devlin, 46, from Nunhead, London, is living with a bizarre condition called prosopagnosia, also known as face-blindness, meaning he struggles to recognise faces - even those of his own family.

Mr Devlin, a painter, has been forced to memorise his family's voices and body language in order to know who they are.

But reading voices and body language doesn't always work, and has even mistaken another boy for his son when picking his children up from school before.

Daniel Devlin, 46, suffers from rare condition prosopagnosia, also known as face-blindness. He was born with the part of his brain responsible for facial recognition damaged. Despite living with his wife Katarina, daughter Klara, eight and son Emil, five,  he struggles to recognise them

Mr Devlin said: 'Humans have a special ability to recognise people by seeing their faces, I really don't have this ability.

'Maybe a good way to imagine what it's like to have prosopagnosia is to try and recognise people by what their hands look like.

'Every person has a different hand but if someone showed you a photo of someone's hands, you might struggle to recognise who the person is, even if that person turns out to be someone you know very well.

'I just thought that everyone was the same or maybe I just wasn't putting in as much effort as others to remember people.

'If I saw my wife Katarina somewhere unexpected and she pretended not to know me, then I'm not sure I would know it was her.

'It often leaves me in some awkward situations, especially when I don't recognise people that I should or think I know people that I don't.

'I have learnt to recognise people based on their body language and voices instead.'

Mr Devlin struggles to recognise the faces of his wife Katarina, as well as his children Klara, eight, and Emil, five.

Mrs Devlin said: 'When the children are in school uniform, they all look very similar to Daniel.

'He once mistook someone else for our son, which got a very disapproving look from the boy's mother.

Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces.

Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers.

Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object.

Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces.

The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities.

It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory.

Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases.

In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth.

It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion.

Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome.

Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes.

'If we've met someone before I will try and tell him who it is before we speak to them.

'It does cause some awkward situations but usually we just find it funny.'

Experts said propagnosia is not linked to problems with vision, memory or intelligence.

Instead, it is thought to be the result of impairment in the right 'fusiform gyrus' of the brain - a fold that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory.

This could be as a result of a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases.

Or, in cases such as Mr Devlin's - the condition is present at birth, and the pathways in the brain responsible for recognition never developed properly.

Though he now knows he has had the had the condition all his life, Mr Devlin was only diagnosed in the last few years, through sheer chance. 

He said: 'I heard a programme about it on the radio and realised that's what I had.

Test confirmed he was suffering from face-blindness.

He said: 'I had to do tests where I was shown a number of faces, then I would be shown another set of faces, some that were shown before and some new ones.

'I would have to say which ones I had seen before. My score was well below that of people without the condition.

'We also had the same kind of test but instead of faces, we would have images of horses or houses and my scores would be in line with people without the condition.'

It is thought the condition affects up to one in 50 people, the equivalent of about 1.5 million people in the UK.

Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, but in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object.

Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces.

Mr Devlin's face-blindness is not so severe, but he has failed to recognise celebrities in the past.

He said: 'Growing up I loved films, but my favourite stars were always those that had distinctive voices or characters like James Cagney or Woody Allen.

'Katarina is Croatian and once we saw a very famous rock band there. I met the drummer and was convinced he was Katarina's neighbour.

'I don't think he was used to not being recognised and he was a bit annoyed.'

Although there is no treatment for the condition, Mr Devlin has learnt coping strategies .

He said: 'Most people know that I have it so it's not a problem.

'There are ways to cope. If I see someone who seems to know me then I ask them vague questions, like how are things, is work okay, until I can figure out who they are.

'I also always say "nice to see you" rather than "nice to meet you", just in case I have met them before.'

Mr Devlin says if his wife Katarina pretended not to know him, he probably wouldn't recognise her. If someone they know approaches them, Mrs Devlin whispers their name into her husband's ear so he can greet them, even if he doesn't recognise them

There is a prosopagnosia research group at Birkbeck University, London, where Mr Devlin found out he suffered from the condition.

Researcher Joanna Parketny, who has been working with Mr Devlin, said: 'Individuals affected by this condition have trouble in recognising not only famous but also personally known faces such as friends or even family.

They also struggle to learn new faces, while having normal vision, intellect and memory, she added.

She continued: 'The ability to successfully recognise faces is an incredibly important skill which allows us to navigate in the complex social environment.'

Not being able to recognise faces can negatively affect people's well-being and lead to anxiety in social situations, she said.

'In extreme but rare cases it can lead to a person's withdrawal and alienation,' she said.

'The impact of prosopagnosia on an individual depends on the severity of the condition, their individual predisposition and personality.

'It's also dependent on the presence or absence of other conditions and lastly but very importantly the attitude and awareness of the people who make up our social environment.'
