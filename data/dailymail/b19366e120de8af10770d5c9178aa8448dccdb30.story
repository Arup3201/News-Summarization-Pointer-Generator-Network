A weightlifter who lost her right arm in a car crash is beating all of her old records and says it is 'the best thing that could have happened'.

Krystal Cantu, 25, from Texas, had her arm amputated last year after the car she was travelling in with her boyfriend flipped over - painfully crushing her limb.

But this has increased her ferocity in the gym and she can now can lift a 210lb bar clear above her head with just her left arm, more than she could lift before the crash.

Weighlighter Krystal Cantu, 25, from Texas, had her arm amputated last year, but she is beating all her records

She found the courage to get back to her CrossFit training just three weeks after the accident.

'I looked at my arm and I thought OK - that looks pretty bad - but survival mode just kicked in,' said Miss Cantu.

'I had to think - what do I need to do now?'

'I had people trying to help me and I was trying not to look at my arm but I could see it in the reflection of one guy's sunglasses.

'When I arrived at the hospital, the surgeon came up to me and said that he had looked at everything and the arm needed to come off.

'I had a moment but then I said alright - if it's going to save my life take it off.

'Not a day goes by that I don't think about it. 

'But I feel like I can conquer anything when I'm in the gym - I feel like I have super powers when I'm in there.'

Her boyfriend Daniel Cuate, 26, had been driving through their home-town of San Antonio when a tyre blew and the car flipped in the air.

He escaped unscathed but Miss Cantu was told that her arm would need to be amputated after she was airlifted to hospital.

'The accident was the best thing that could have happened to me, so much good has come out of it,' added the IT consultant.

'I've inspired so many which I still find really odd and strange.

'I'm really surprised that people call me an inspiration. I think it's really cool that people from around the world say that I've helped them get back up and get into shape.

'People from around the world have been in touch to say that I've helped them - someone like me, just a normal girl from Texas - that's just incredible.'

Her coach Chris Xanders says the intensity is always turned up a notch when the adapted athlete is in the gym.

He added: 'Everyone sees that what she's doing may look difficult but she's still going through it and trying her best.

'You can feel that the intensity is really turned up when Krystal is in the gym.'

But shockingly, despite her courage, Miss Cantu still falls victim to Internet trolls.

She added: 'There are some really mean people out there that just don't understand that I do things the right way.

'I don't just do this to get attention, I do this because I love to train but I do attract some negative comments.'

Despite having a very successful career in IT, Miss Cantu  has her heart set on competing professionally in CrossFit.

'Adaptive athletes can do anything normal people can do and I just really want the CrossFit games and the CrossFit headquarters to see that and give us a chance to compete,' she said. 

CrossFit is a discipline that combines weightlifting, gymnastics and cardio.
