Some museums have to trap treasures behind dusty glass to protect them, which obscures many of the most interesting and intricate details.

But a new invention could give them a fresh lease of life.

Scientists have developed interactive semi-transparent mirrors that allow people to ‘touch’ objects using the reflection of their fingers.

Scientists have developed interactive semi-transparent mirrors that allow people to ‘touch’ exhibits in museums that are behind glass, using the reflection of their fingers, to reveal information and manipulate inaccessible objects (pictured)

By tracking the movement of their hands, the mirrors use augmented reality to let visitors pick up and rotate the virtual objects - and reveal more information about certain items. 

To create the technology, computer scientists from the University of Bristol created a setup that involved sensors, projectors and semi-transparent mirrors placed in front of a pane of glass.

Using the sensors, the viewer's movements are tracked, while their reflection is mapped on a mirror inside.

As a finger's reflection lands on an object inside the glass, the artefact is illuminated and menu options appear using augmentation and the projectors.

Depending on the setup, an information box will pop up to show details about that object, or a 3D virtual model will appear in mid-air.

This model can then be rotated using hand gestures, to explore the artefact from every angle.

Depending on the setup, an information box will pop up to show specific details about that object, or a 3D virtual model will appear in mid-air.

This model can then be rotated using hand gestures, to explore the artefact from every angle.  

The technology could also be used by doctors to project brain scans onto a patient’s body, and in airports as a new kind of security scanner that would reveal the location of hidden objects by showing their location on a person.

The researchers have unveiled their study at the ACM UIST conference in Honolulu, Hawaii. 

They claim their device could change the way people interact in public spaces, such as museums and shops.

In a museum, people in front of a cabinet would see the reflection of their fingers inside the glass case overlapping the same point behind the glass, allowing them to seemingly reach around objects.

Museums: Semi-transparent mirrors could aloow people to ‘touch’ exhinbts in museums that are behind glass, with the reflection of their fingers to reveal information and illuminate inaccessible objects

Hospitals: Doctors could project brain scans onto a patient’s body.

Airports: The technology could be used as a new kind of security scanner that could reveal the location of hidden objects by showing their location on a person.

Shops: People could try on clothes when a shop is closed by using semi-transparent mirrors and an interactive system.

Music studio: Musicians can record loops on digital mixers, which appear as floating images above it. They could grab the representations to play or edit them using different musical effects.

Museum goers could also interact with exhibits by focusing their eyes on them.

By combining the mirror with a projector, people’s fingertips could act like little torches to illuminate the objects they point at.

When the reflection of someone’s hand cuts though the object, the projections on visitors’ hands could also reveal the inside of an object on display.

They could use their finger as a cursor to rotate a 3D reconstruction of an object too.

Lead researcher Dr Diego Martinez told MailOnline that the technology uses the space behind and in front of the reflective surface to add augmentations.

'For instance, in the museum cabinet, the top projector allows you to do projection mapping, changing the external aspect of the object. 

'However, it would never be able to reveal its internals. Using our approach, your hand's reflection can cut through the object.If we project on your hand as it cuts though, this will be visible inside the object.'

The researchers have also demonstrated how their technology can be used by musicians.

The computer scientists claim the system could also allow people to try on clothes when a shop is closed by using semi-transparent mirrors and an interactive system.

‘This work offers exciting interactive possibilities that could be used in many situations,’ continued Dr Martinez, a researcher in human-computer interaction.

‘Semi-transparent surfaces are everywhere around us, in every bank and shop window.

One example is when people can’t access a shop because it’s closed. 

'However, their reflection would be visible inside the shop window and that would enable them to try clothes on using their reflection, pay for the item using a debit/credit card and then have it delivered to their home. 

‘The possibility to blend together the spaces in front and behind the semi-transparent mirror could mean a whole new type of interactive experience.

‘While projectors can only augment the surface of objects, combining them with reflections allows people to reveal what’s inside the object or even purely virtual objects floating around them.

Semi-transparent mirrors let people ‘touch’ objects with finger reflections

These reflections can illuminate and reveal information about artefacts

Museum goers could also interact with exhibits simply by looking at them

Technology could additionally be used by doctors to project brain scans, or by retailers in shop windows so people can try on clothes
