Nick Clegg was yesterday forced to defend himself after he admitted a vulnerable woman wrote to him to complain about inappropriate advances by MP Mike  Hancock more than three years ago.

The Liberal Democrat leader acknowledged his office received a letter from the woman in March 2011 begging for help, but denied that he had ‘turned a blind eye’ to the problem, claiming that it was never brought to his attention.

As part of a court settlement on Wednesday, Mr Hancock, 68, admitted he had ‘crossed the line’ and had an ‘inappropriate and unprofessional’ relationship with the woman after she sought his help as her local MP.

Portsmouth South MP, Mike Hancock admitted he had 'crossed the line' in his friendship with a vulnerable constituent with mental health problems who had come to him for help

Mr
 Clegg yesterday called on Mr Hancock, who has already had the Lib Dem 
whip withdrawn in Parliament and his party membership suspended, to 
leave the party altogether.

‘He should resign from the party. Of 
course he should. Absolutely,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio. ‘He has made an 
apology that makes it clear that the way he behaved was totally and 
utterly out of order. He has caused huge, huge distress. Frankly, that 
has no role in the Liberal Democrats – the party I lead.’

The woman,
 known as ‘Annie’, first wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister on March 9, 
2011 to complain about Mr Hancock. In a letter sent by recorded delivery
 to the Liberal Democrat headquarters, she wrote: ‘I am deeply upset 
that as the Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats 
you have done nothing to oust this man from politics.

The former Lib Dem MP - who is now sitting as an independent - caused 'huge, huge distress', Nick Clegg claimed today

‘He cannot be 
trusted and he is a liability to women, the public and also your party. 
His conduct should be a matter for you as leader of the party. Please 
reply to this as it is very important to me that I get an answer from 
you.’

The woman, 
who also believes she was 'bullied' during her battle, first went to the
 Portsmouth South MP with concerns about noisy neighbours in 2009. That 
issue remains unresolved. 

Her
 teenage son, who has stood by her during the campaign for justice, 
welcomed the apology and said his mother had 'been very strong'.

The
 teenager said: 'I think justice has been served and it's enough for me.
 But the apology doesn't account for the last four years.

'My
 mum has been very strong, and we have gone through ups and downs 
together. I think Mike Hancock should stand down from the Liberal 
Democrat party permanently and as an MP.'

A full statement from the woman said: 'I'm pleased there's been a resolution to what's been a long and hurtful ordeal for me.

'Since
 the incidents about which I complained happened back in 2010, my 
physical and mental health have suffered and i'm grateful that I may now
 have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both me and
 my son.

'I'm pleased the defendant now recognises that i did not bring the case for financial gain.

'I only ever sought justice and an apology from Mr Hancock. and that is what my legal team fought to obtain throughout.

'Some
 Liberal Democrat councillors serving on Portsmouth City Council have 
sought publicly to discredit myself and my motives for bringing an 
action against Mr Hancock, ignoring and even trying to undermine the 
independent investigation report commissioned by their own QC Nigel 
Pascoe.

'Finally,
 I'd urge anyone else who has suffered from unwarranted approaches where
 someone particularly in public office, has abused their trust to come 
forward.'

■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she  targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat.

■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’

■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office.

■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann (right), a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’

■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’

Mr Clegg yesterday said the party had taken no action at that 
time as Hampshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service, which had 
both looked into the matter, had decided there was no basis on which to 
proceed.

He claimed: ‘She is quite right to say back in 2011 
something was sent to my office. It didn’t reach me. When I was given 
specific allegations early in 2013, I responded as promptly as I 
reasonably could and Mike Hancock was suspended as an MP for the party.’

Yesterday it emerged that the Portsmouth South MP has taken £275,077 in
 salary from the public purse and a further £72,004 in expenses since 
the woman complained to Mr Clegg.

Politicians in Portsmouth have 
called on Mr Hancock to quit and trigger a by-election.

Labour 
Councillor John Ferrett said: ‘His position is completely untenable. 
There is no way people in Portsmouth can trust him as their MP.’

However
 Mr Hancock will not face an investigation by the parliamentary sleaze 
watchdog. This means that he could cling on until next year’s election –
 putting pressure on the Government to introduce reforms allowing 
constituents to recall rogue MPs.

Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said: 
‘This clearly shows we need recall. It’s absurd that unless he chooses 
to step down, his constituents are stuck with him.’
