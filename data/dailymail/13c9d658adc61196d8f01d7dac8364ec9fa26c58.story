A coroner has resigned after being barred from crime scenes and touching dead bodies because he stuck his fingers into the head wound of a shooting victim, authorities revealed.

Coroner Terry Jarnigan, of Cocke County, Tennessee, was barred by a judge on Monday from disturbing or touching dead bodies, touching evidence or attending crime scenes.

Jarnigan reportedly went Newport Medical Center on November 2 to determine whether a 39-year-old victim, who was found with a gunshot wound to the head, committed suicide or was a homicide.

The corner stuck two fingers into a bullet exit wound on the victim's head and on realizing he had brain matter on his fingers, put it back into the wound and made a remark 'Oh, brains', according to a police affidavit.

A detective, Paula Wilson, was at the hospital to take forensic photos for the investigation, according to the affidavit seen by 10 News. Wilson said that Jarnigan was 'twisting his finger around' in the head wound.

Investigators typically try not to contaminate bodies because it can damage potential evidence. 

Deputy DA General Brownlow Marsh alleged on November 19 that Jarnigan had contaminated evidence at other crime scenes after showing up uninvited. 

Jarnigan resigned on Tuesday, effective immediately. 

In 1977, Jarnigan, then known as Terry Lackey, was convicted of felonies including 'willful injury by explosives' and arson and detonation of explosives with intent to harm a person.

He had his citizenship rights restored in 2002 after a court decided that he had 'the character of a person of honesty, integrity, respectability and veracity'.

Don and Annette Heitman (pictured with their son Alex) have called for the investigation into his death to be reopened after the coroner who oversaw the scene resigned for mishandling of bodies and investigations 

On Wednesday, a family whose son's death investigation was overseen by Coroner Jarnigan have called for Cocke County authorities to reopen the investigation into his death.

Alex Heitman, 29, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in July 2011 in a remote part of Cocke County, 70 miles from his home in Knoxville.

Mr Heitman, a business supervisor at Oak Ridge Schools, had moved to Tennessee in 2008 with his new wife Kristie. She was eight months' pregnant at the time of his death.

His parents, Don and Annette Heitman, from Wisconsin, remain unconvinced of the official verdict of suicide. 

They have repeatedly asked that Alex's death be re-examined by authorities who have offered the family little cooperation.

The Heitmans recently hired retired Assistant U.S. Attorney Hugh B. Ward Jr to represent them and obtained the assistance of Oak Ridge City Councilwoman Trina Baughn, to act as their Tennessee proxy.

Ms Baughn told MailOnline in a statement on Thursday that according to 911 audio files and logs, Jarnigan supervised the scene of Alex Heitman's death for five hours.

However, there exists no evidence that even a basic investigation took place. 

No fingerprints, ballistics, coroner’s report, police report or credible crime scene photos were ever discovered to have been taken.

People who lived near the scene found evidence that had been left behind the following day, Ms Baughn said. According the Heitman family, this included portions of Alex’s brain matter and a shotgun shell casing.

Ms Baughn said on Thursday: 'My heart aches for this family and I am willing to do whatever I can to help them find the answers they seek.'

In a statement this week, the Heitmans said: 'We have exhausted tremendous time and financial resources over the last 3½ years with little cooperation from local authorities.

'It is our hope that with Mr. Ward’s help and that of Oak Ridge City Councilwoman Trina Baughn as our Tennessee resident proxy, we will finally obtain the answers we need to find closure and move on from the devastating loss of our beloved son.'
