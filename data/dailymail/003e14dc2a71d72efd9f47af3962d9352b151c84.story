Sabre-toothed tigers feasted on prehistoric horses, researchers believe.

The diets of ancient apex predators is difficult to discern, because as they were at the top of the food chain there were fewer of them.

But 'exceptional fossil sites' in Cerro de los Batallones, near Madrid, have yielded clues as to what three ancient carnivores fed upon, reports journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

This illustration depicts how the region of Cerro de los Batallones in central Spain likely looked 9 million years ago. Researchers used carbon to shed light on how saber-toothed cats and bear dogs shared space and prey during the late Miocene period

Researchers studied two sabre-toothed cats - one the size of a modern leopard and the other the size of a modern tiger - as well as a prehistoric 'bear dog'.

The team calculated what kind of creatures lived in the area nine million years ago from dental records.

They then compared the carbon isotope of the three predators to those of the herbivores, allowing them to make a calculation as to what the beasts ate.

Dr Soledad Domingo, of the University of Michigan, said that the sabre toothed cats ate ancient horses, while the bear dog ate astroportax, similar to the modern buffalo.

He said: 'The two sabre toothed cats consumed herbivores from more dense woodland, a habitat that would have allowed the smaller cat to hide from the larger one.

'On the basis of their different body sizes it is likely that these two cats avoided competition for prey by hunting herbivores of different size.

Little has been known about how the sabre toothed tiger, shown here in a California museum, co-existed with other species

'Analysis indicated that hipparionine horses were moderately to very feasible prey of these cats.

'The smaller cat probably incorporated additional prey species from more dense woodland.'

He said a study of the bear dog found it 'implied prey acquisition from open woodland

'Diet preferences indicate it was the only predator commonly consuming astroportax, that occupied more open woodland.'

To arrive at their findings, the researchers conducted what's called a stable carbon isotope analysis on the animals' teeth.

Using a dentist's drill with a diamond bit, they sampled teeth from 69 specimens, including 27 saber-toothed cats and bear dogs.

The rest were plant-eaters.

They isolated the carbon from the tooth enamel.

Using a mass spectrometer, which you could think of as a type of scale, they measured the ratio of the more massive carbon 13 molecules to the less-massive carbon 12.

An isotope is a version of an element that contains a different number of neutrons in its nucleus.Carbon 12 and 13 are both present in the carbon dioxide that plants take in during photosynthesis.

Different plants make use of the isotopes in different ways, and so they retain different amounts of them in their fibers.

When an herbivore eats a plant, that plant leaves an isotopic signature in the animal's bones and teeth.

The signature travels through the food chain and can be found in carnivores as well.
