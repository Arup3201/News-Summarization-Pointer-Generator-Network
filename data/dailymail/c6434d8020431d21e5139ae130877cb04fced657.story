Stretched families are saving money by cooking their own traditional meals, according to new research.

A poll of 2,000 Britons found that 83 per cent said that they mostly cooked from scratch.

The economic downturn has been a factor in the findings with many households saving money by cooking old-style family favourites for themselves.

Baking Britain: A survey found that most meals are cooked totally from scratch in eight out of ten households

This year's horse meat scandal also put families off ready made meals, and most now prefer to use fresh ingredients.

A survey found that most meals are cooked totally from scratch in more than eight out of ten households.

In the study 11 per cent of people admitted to mostly eating ready meals, while four per cent said that they relied on takeaways.

And a lucky two per cent said that they mostly eat their meals at restaurants.

The researchers also asked people which home-cooked meal they make most.

1. Bangers & mash - 77%

2. Spaghetti Bolognese - 76%

3. Omelette - 75%

4. Roast dinner - 74%

5. Shepherd’s pie - 69%

6. Cake - 61%

7. Soup - 60%

8. Chilli & rice - 59%

9. Chicken curry - 58%

10. Hot pot - 53%

Top of the list is bangers and mash followed by spaghetti Bolognese and omelettes.

The success of Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry and their hit series The Great British Bake Off has also had an effect.

Over six in ten of the Britons claimed they could bake a cake - a figure that includes over four in ten men.

Wren Living, the company that commissioned the research, said that the findings show a sharp change in attitudes among families.

The findings are part of an ongoing study by the company into how UK homeowners use their kitchens as part of everyday life.

Earlier this year, a study by the Department of Health’s Change4Life campaign found that just over half of families prepared meals from basic ingredients four times a week or less.

But the latest findings show that the popularity of cooking from scratch in Britain’s kitchens has risen dramatically since then.

The company's managing director Armando Sanchez said: 'British families take a lot of stick for relying on ready meals but our findings show that some of the criticism is undeserved.

'Whether it’s a direct result of the horse meat scandal or because the likes of Jamie Oliver are showing us how easy it is to eat well and cook from scratch, more and more of us are giving it a go.'
