A rebuilt castle, a garden chapel, a university library called The Hive and even bullet-proof toilets have been honoured on a list of Britain's best new buildings.

Forty-three projects in the UK have won awards for architectural excellence from the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba).

Nine more buildings from the EU, including the canary yellow Ferrari museum in Medina, Italy, will now vie for Riba's top award, the Stirling Prize, to be  announced on September 26 in London.

Study: The sustainable Hive library built on the Worcester university campus is the first of its kind in Europe with 250,000 books, 12 miles of archive collections and has a million visitors a year

Idyllic: A view of the visitors' centre at Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, Northern Ireland

Renovated: Astley Castle, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, which was destroyed by fire but has now been turned into a family home

Modernised: The architects have turned Astley Castle into a family home

Learning: The Phase 2 west wing of Oxford University's Saïd Business School, where Dixon Jones has created a distinctive new oasis for young thrusters

The winners include, the Olympic masterplan which helped London's bid for the 2012 games, schools, galleries and visitor centres at Stowe Gardens in Buckingham and the Giant's Causeway in Country Antrim, Northern Ireland.

An award went to the environmentally-friendly Marks and Spencer store in Cheshire, while school toilets, designed with glass walls 
and 'pods to reduce privacy, were lauded after 
preventing bullies loitering inside.

Astley Castle,
 a 12th century manor in Nuneaton, Warwickshire was destroyed by a fire and listed as endangered. It has now been rebuilt as a modern home.

Music centre: The building at the University of Kent provides a concert hall and teaching spaces for the  thriving music programme

Concert: Music is played by students for an appreciative audience at the university

Award-winning: The sustainable Olympic Energy Centre in East London provided power and heating for the 2012 games using renewable and energy-efficient technology which included a huge reduction of carbon emissions

Environmentally-friendly housing: The Park Hill estate in Sheffield is one of 42 UK projects honoured by Riba

Music centre: The Bramall Music Building is a 420-seat concert hall, which houses Birmingham University's Department of Music, providing state-of-the-art accommodation for teaching and research

Honoured:The new Chapel of St Albert in George Square, Edinburgh, built for the University Chaplaincy and friary was completed in late last year

The new Chapel of Saint Albert the Great,
 in Edinburgh, received an award for its pristine arc roof and 'steel trees.'

Four tree-like Steel columns support a curved, oak-lined timber roof over the altar and sanctuary spaces.

There are 13 prize-winning buildings in London from swimming baths in Islington, a community nursery in Camden and a West End office.

Other projects include an open-plan 
primary school in Hartlepool with rooms divided only by acoustic 
curtains, a North London day-care hospice modeled on an over-sized house
 to 'appeal sensitively' to patients, and a primary school in Blackburn 
with a playground on the roof.

Located in a dense grid of Victorian workers' terraced houses, the school accommodates 420 pupils in a thriving community of which a large proportion are Indian and Pakistani. It has a rooftop play deck linked to the ground with a tube slide

Open plan: The Forum is the centerpiece for the University of Exeter's famously hilly Streatham campus. It creates a 'green corridor' with an undulating timber gridshell roof

Restored:  Chedworth Roman Villa was accidentally discovered in 1864 by a gamekeeper  digging for a ferret. In 1924 the villa was acquired by the National Trust who started 2011 construction work in 2011 to provide a new cover building for the mosaics to ensure their lasting quality

Winner: The masterplan for London's Olympic Park covered an area of 242 hectares and was the focus of activities during the Olympic and Paralympic Games

Picturesque: After being awarded a £22.3 million grant in November 2007, Heartlands redeveloped the Pool area of West Cornwall which was left largely untouched following the demise of the tin mining industry

Futuristic: Pupils at Jesmond Gardens Primary School enjoy the open plan and circular facilities at the school in Hartlepool where classrooms are separated by acoustic curtains

'Risk-taking is not for the faint-hearted in recessionary times,'  said Riba president Angela Brady told the BBC.

'But amongst this year's crop of truly exceptional buildings I am delighted to see such a variety of projects doing just that.

'It is good to see that sustainability is at the heart of so many of these winners - most clearly perhaps where, encouragingly, a major client has championed it.'

The Riba Awards have been running since 1966 and are judged and presented locally.

Last year's Stirling Prize was won by the Sainsbury Laboratory, an £82m plant research centre at the University of Cambridge.

Iconic: The Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena, Italy, home of the legendary grand prix racing cars

Arty: The Ferrari studio which has two spacious photographic areas which can be hired out. The main corridor has a temporary gallery for photographic art
