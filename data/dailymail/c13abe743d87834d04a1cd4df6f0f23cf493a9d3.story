A woman went into labour early with her twins because she was laughing so hard at a Lee Evans show.

Kayleigh Taylor and her husband Ross had been waiting for a year to the see the comedian at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre.

But the gig was cut short for them on Tuesday night when Kayleigh's waters broke when she was 30 weeks pregnant.

Surprise! Kayleigh Taylor and her husband Ross became parents seven weeks earlier than expected

Kayleigh, 29, and Ross, 36, from Portlethen, in Aberdeenshire dashed off to the hospital and six hours later their sons Reece and Riley were born.

Kayleigh said she was still in shock over their early arrival.

She said: 'We were sitting watching Lee Evans and I honestly thought I had peed myself laughing - my bladder wasn't as good as it normally is.

'I turned to my husband and told him I was going to the toilet because I thought I'd peed myself.

'But when I stood up and was going to the bathroom I realised it wasn't that.'

Kayleigh said she did not expect to go into labour half way through a Lee Evans show.

She added: 'I don't know why but I thought it was going to happen in the house - you just don't think it is going to happen anywhere else.'

Too funny: Kayleigh's waters broke when she was laughing at stand up comic Lee Evans

Missed the end of the show: Kayleigh and Ross had to rush from a Lee Evans gig to the maternity ward after she went into premature labour

Her husband was oblivious to the fact that his wife had gone into labour at the AECC.

But when she failed to return he quickly realised something was wrong.

By this time a first aid team and a doctor were helping the mother-to-be and trying to make her as comfortable as possible.

Ross said: 'When she didn't come back from the toilet I went to find her.

'All I could see was the doctor and staff running about and it turned out she was in labour.'

Ross drove Kayleigh to Aberdeen Maternity Hospital where the couple welcomed their twin boys seven weeks early.

The support engineer said the couple were worried at the time because Kayleigh was not expected to give birth so soon.

Early arrival: Baby Reece (he has a twin brother, Riley)

He added: 'It was quite worrying because we were only at 30 weeks but everything is okay now. They arrived at 2.30am weighing 3lbs each.

'They are in the special care unit just now and will be there for four to five weeks. They are so small but are in a really good place, getting round-the-clock care.'

The couple, who have been married since 2012, conceived the babies through IVF treatment.

They used one embryo egg which split so they know the boys will grow up as identical twins.

Kayleigh said the labour went well despite it being unexpected. And the training competence co-ordinator said it was great to have such a fantastic story to tell all her family and friends.

She joked: 'People have been saying we should call them Lee and Evans, but I think we will stick to the names we have.'

Ross added that the next time the funnyman is in town they'll be first in line for tickets.

He said: 'We'll certainly be queuing up if he comes back. I'd quite like to see how the show ends.'
