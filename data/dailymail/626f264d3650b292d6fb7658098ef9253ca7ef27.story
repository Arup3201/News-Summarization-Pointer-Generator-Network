This is the moment a group of shocked tourists were almost flattened by a humpback whale's enormous tail as it splashed down metres from their boat.

Two of the gigantic creatures were swimming slowly down the northwestern coast feeding on krill when one made a spectacular dive deep into the ocean.

Its large tail fin - known as a fluke - arced out of the sea and over the startled whale watchers' flimsy rubber dinghy.

As the animal's bulky form disappeared into the waves, the relieved tourists were left thanking their lucky stars for their narrow escape from capsizing.

The humpback, meanwhile, continued its search for crustaceans deep under the surface.

Professional photographer Tony Beck, from Ottawa, Canada, captured the astonishing moment at the Antarctic Peninsula from another boat

Mr Beck, a 58-year-old tour guide, said: 'I've learned to expect the unexpected - those on the boat were smiling, many cheered and laughed.'

It's dinner time! The enormous creatures, which can weigh up to 48 tons, disappear beneath the surface six or seven minutes in their hunt for krill

Three zodiac boats are following the humpbacks - which can weigh an amazing 48 tons - as they meander along the coast.

Mr Beck added: 'The whales mostly just came to the surface, released their breath with a big blow, then submerged themselves for a minute or so.

'But after repeating this many times while feeding, they eventually arched their back and dove.

'Whenever I see humpback whales doing this I know that their tail follows them out of the water.

'And, poof, they were gone for about six or seven minutes. When this happens, it's a real adrenaline rush.'
