George Clooney has confessed to calling Las Vegas gambling mogul Steve Wynn an 'a**hole' and storming off at a recent dinner because the casino-owner insulted President Barack Obama.

The verbal assault occurred two weeks ago when the two-time Oscar winner was in Vegas promoting his Casamigos tequila, and was invited to dine with Wynn and his wife, Andrea Hissom, at the fancy Botero restaurant inside the 72-year-old's Encore hotel.

But when dinner was finished, the conversation turned to Obama's Affordable Care Act, of which Wynn is a vocal opponent. That's when sparks began to fly.

Clooney immediately took exception to how the billionaire chairman and CEO spoke of his 'longtime friend.'

He allegedly declared that he didn't have to listen to 'this f***ing stuff' before exiting to another bar.

Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Clooney likes his alcohol and 'got drunk' after drinking tequila shots.

'When he's drinking, he considers himself a close personal buddy of the president,' the said.

'Clooney's fun to be with when he's sober. If you have a chance to drink with him, you want to get there early, and don't stay late.

'Everybody who's in my business, the casino business, knows to take actors with a grain of salt.'Wynn added Clooney's partners were 'mortified.'

However,
 in a statement sent to the newspaper, Clooney said: 'There were nine 
people at that table ... so you can ask them. ... Steve likes to go on 
rants.

'He
 called the president an a**hole ... that is a fact ... I said the 
President was my longtime friend and then he said "your friend is an 
a**hole."

'...At that point I told Steve that HE was an asshole and I wasn't going to sit at his table while he was being such a jackass.

'And I walked out. There were obviously quite a few more adjectives and adverbs used by both of us.

He added: 'It had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with character.'

Clooney was joined by his Casamigos business partners Rande Gerber and Michael Meldman at the table, as well as a few others.
