Ireland's voters gave a grudging seal of approval to an EU treaty that paves the way for further austerity measures across the continent in a desperate attempt to fight the debt-crisis that threatens the existence of the euro.

The treaty's approval, to be declared officially later today, relieves some pressure on EU financial chiefs as they battle to contain the eurozone's debt crisis.

But critics said the tougher deficit rules would do nothing to stimulate desperately needed growth in bailed-out Ireland, Portugal and Greece nor stop Spain or Italy from requiring aid too.

Around 60 per cent of those polled are believed to have backed the austerity plans. The first constituencies to return a result were Tipperary South and Galway East.

They declared an overall 62 per cent majority in favour as campaigners on both sides accepted victory for the Yes campaign.

Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said his government was relieved that voters have approved the European Union's deficit-fighting treaty, and now must work with EU partners to build a plan to boost growth prospects across the debt-battered eurozone.

Ireland's Socialist Party leader Joe Higgins, who opposed the treaty, said: 'The 'yes' side is going to win.

'The question now is where will the jobs and the stability they have promised come from, against the backdrop of a continuing and deepening capitalist crisis within Europe? Their policies will only make the situation worse.'

Dozens of party activists monitoring the ballot counting at several centres across Ireland reported the 'yes' side solidly outpolling 'no' voters several hours ahead of the official result announcement at Dublin Castle.

The activists, called 'tallymen', stood near official ballot-counters and made their own calculations.

A
 strong majority of districts reported pro-treaty majorities, with the 
'yes' side polling between 55 per cent and 75 per cent in largely 
middle-class suburban areas of Dublin, home to a third of Ireland's 
4.5million people.

Eurozone unemployment has hit a record high and job losses are likely to keep climbing as the debt crisis eats away at businesses' ability to hire workers while indebted governments continue to cut staff.

Around 17.4million people were out of work in the 17-nation eurozone in April (11% of the working population) - the highest level since records began in 1995, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said today.

'This 11% level is going to continue edging up in the coming months and probably until the end of the year,' said Francois Cabau, an economist at Barclays Capital who sees the eurozone's economy contracting 0.1% this year.

'The economic activity situation tells you the story of the labour market. There's been basically no economic growth since the fourth quarter of last year and indicators are pointing to very weak growth momentum for the second quarter,' he said.

ING economist Martin van Vliet said he sees the unemployment rate reaching slightly above 11.5% if the economy starts to recover later this year. But if the downturn worsens, 'the risk is for an even higher peak in unemployment,' he said.

As the debt crisis intensifies, companies in the euro zone are trying to keep their labour costs low as they struggle with falling demand and profits, while a German-led drive to cut deficits and debt is pressuring governments to shrink spending.

But some economists say austerity policies in an economic downturn are self-defeating because governments receive less tax receipts as unemployment grows and must pay out more money in jobless benefits.

The 
anti-treaty vote was strongest in urban working-class districts where 
anger over the crippling cost of Ireland's bank-bailout program runs 
highest. But even there, tallymen reported, the votes were splitting nearly evenly.

Unofficial vote tallies from rich and 
poor parts of Dublin and Cork, the second-largest city, illustrated a 
stark class divide in how Ireland voted.

The Dublin Southwest and Dublin Midwest districts, with swathes of run-down public housing blocks, voted 51 per cent against the treaty.

But on the prosperous south side, the suburban port of Dun Laoghaire voted 72 per cent for the treaty, Dublin South 66 per cent in favor. Significantly, turnout was much higher in more affluent districts.

Overall, about half of Ireland's 3.13million registered voters participated in yesterday's referendum, typical in an officially neutral country that is constitutionally required to hold a referendum on each European treaty.

Public rejection could have blocked Ireland from receiving new EU loans once its 2010 bailout money runs out next year.

It also would have sent political shockwaves through other eurozone members, where anger against austerity and bank bailouts runs similarly high but citizens are denied the chance to vote on the treaty.

Ireland is the only country that will put the fiscal treaty - a German-led plan for stricter budget rules - to a referendum.

The treaty needs the approval of only 12 of the 17 euro zone countries to be ratified, but an Irish rejection would have undermined one of Europe's key initiatives just as problems mount in Spain and Greece.

Analysts said that a 'Yes' vote would give Ireland a better chance of getting back to bond markets as planned next year and hand Europe a rare piece of good news, though one it will have little time to bask in with more to worry about elsewhere.

'I don't think there will be much market reaction this morning, simply because it's in line with expectations that were built up because of the polls,' said Dermot O'Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers.

'It is a message of support from Ireland to Europe, I think that's very simply what it is. Policymakers won't have long to celebrate because there are wider issues in the euro area that they now must move their attention onto.'

Irish two-year bond yields were higher on the day at a near five-month high of 7.53 per cent, meaning short-term borrowing costs still remained above those on longer-term bonds, a sign that investors are pricing in the possibility that Dublin will need a second bailout.

In a sign of the modicum of stability that has returned to Ireland's economy, data showed on Thursday that deposits held by Ireland's domestic banks rose to a 14-month high in April.

That was in sharp contrast to Spain where depositors worried about their banks moved money abroad at the fastest rate since records began, recalling the tens of billions of euros that flew out of Ireland ahead of its bailout.

Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who campaigned with warnings that Ireland would face harsher austerity if it rejected the treaty, offered a cautious welcome for the early results and declined to declare victory.

'I'm hopeful for a strong 'yes' vote. The early trends would indicate a strong run in favor of the `yes' vote. We'll wait to see what the trends are around the country,' said Kenny.

He rose to power 14 months ago on a platform promising to pull Ireland out of recession, minimise the cost of bank rescues, and getting the country borrowing normally again on bond markets by next year.

The treaty, signed in February by leaders of 25 countries including Ireland, proposes that all members who ratify it should reduce their annual deficits to no more than 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The current eurozone limit is 3 per cent.

Ireland, already four years into a brutal austerity program that has slashed around 15 per cent from many workers' incomes, is committed to reaching the 3 per cent threshold by 2015.

Opponents of the treaty argued that the tougher new deficit rule would force Ireland to stay on the austerity road until 2020 at least.

Ireland has posted the EU's worst deficits since 2009, including an EU-record 32.4 per cent in 2010 and 13.1 per cent last year.

Both figures were greatly inflated by the exceptional costs of Ireland's decision to nationalise five of its six banks rather than see any collapse - a debt burn that pushed Ireland itself to the brink of bankruptcy in 2010.

Repayments to international bondholders, central banks and interest on decades-long loans are expected to cost Ireland's taxpayers €68billion, equivalent to €19,000 for every man, woman and child.
