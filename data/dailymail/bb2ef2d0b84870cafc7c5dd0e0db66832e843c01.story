Large percentages of teenagers admitted that they engage in dangerous behaviors while driving as varied as changing contact lenses to doing homework.

Twenty-seven per cent of those surveyed said that they have changed clothes or shoes behind the wheel. 

'Teens are busy, I guess,' lead author David Hurwitz of Oregon State University told NPR.

Large percentages of teenagers admitted that they text or change their clothes and shoes while behind the wheel

The young adults, aged 14 to 18 in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, responded to questions about their driving habits for his study, published in the Journal of Transportation Safety & Security.

Other distractions including changing radio stations, adjusting a GPS system, putting on makeup and a teenager who admitted playing guitar while driving. 

Cellphones are the biggest dangers to both adults and teenagers. 

Forty per cent out of 1400 Pacific Northwest teens said they had texted while driving, which is a decline from earlier studies. 

Distracted driving is the leading cause of among all drivers, including teenagers.

More than 3,000 people were killed by distracted driving in 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Practices such as texting can be especially dangerous to young drivers.

Eleven per cent of all drivers under 20 in fatal car accidents were distracted when they crashed.

Dr Hurwitz took teenagers into a classroom to demonstrate that completing simple tasks like writing on a chalkboard were much harder when attention was being pulled away by telephone conversations or other distractions. 

The scientist said that after the class, 'students were slightly better at recognizing the risks of multitasking behind the wheel,' to Yahoo News.

Many states have laws against young drivers texting or speaking on the phone while driving.
