Rachel Treweek, the Archdeacon of Hackney, will become the most senior woman bishop in the country

The House of Lords will get its first ever female bishop when Parliament returns after the election, it was announced today.

Rachel Treweek, the Archdeacon of Hackney, will become the most senior woman bishop in the country after being named the next Bishop of Gloucester.

While she is only the third woman to be made a bishop since the Church of England broke with centuries of tradition earlier this year, the Venerable Treweek will become the first to become a peer.

The Church of England peers – known as 31 'Lords Spiritual' – which are usually decided on seniority but the Government has introduced new rules to fast-track women bishops into the Lords.

The new bishop has been Archdeacon of Hackney in north east London since 2011.

She was raised in Hertfordshire, studied linguistics at Reading University and worked as a speech and language therapist before entering the church.

The 52-year-old – who is married to a priest-in-charge of two parishes in the City of London – then attended Oxford University's evangelical theological college Wycliffe Hall and was ordained in 1994.

The Venerable Treweek today revealed she was 'surprised' at her appointment but said it was 'an immense joy and privilege'.

She said: 'I have to admit, even a little daunted by the prospect, but my overwhelming feeling is one of excitement to be coming to join with others in sharing the love of Jesus Christ with the people of this diocese.'

The appointment means she is the first woman to run a diocese and is one rank below an Archbishop.

She said: 'I am looking forward to encouraging Christians to speak out with confidence about their faith and the good news that the Gospel brings. It will be my privilege to work with churches as we connect with people, wherever they are and whatever their concerns.

'My calling to the role of bishop has been shaped by human encounter. I believe profoundly that relationship is at the heart of who God is. I have been with people through the joys and pains of their lives and it is these experiences that I will reflect upon as I take up this new role.'

The Venerable Treweek was a curate at St George and All Saints in Tufnell Park before becoming Vicar of St James the Less in Bethnal Green in 1999. She was appointed Archdeacon of Northolt in 2006.

While Rachel Treweek will become only the third woman to be made a bishop since the Church of England broke with centuries of tradition earlier this year, she will become the first to be made a peer

Her formal enthronement as bishop of the diocese, home to 600,000 people and 305 parishes, will take place at Gloucester Cathedral later in the year.

The appointment was welcomed throughout the Church.

The Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, said: 'What fantastic news. Wow, how wonderful so soon after Bishop Libby.

'I'm thrilled for you, dear Rachel, and I'm thrilled for the Diocese of Gloucester, for the Church of England, for the Church of God and for all of us. Yippee.'

And the Right Rev Lane said: 'I congratulate Rachel on her nomination as Bishop of Gloucester. She is an exceptional priest whose leadership is well proven. She is both genuinely caring and deeply insightful.

'Her experience as an Archdeacon, in General Synod, and the national church will equip her well for her future ministry.

'It has been an honour to serve alongside Rachel as Regional Representatives in the House of Bishops, and I rejoice that she takes her place there as of right. Rachel and Guy are in my prayers as they prepare for this exciting change in their lives.'

The Bishop of London Richard Chartres, said: 'As Richard of Gloucester is reinterred, Rachel of Gloucester is revealed. Rachel has served her entire ministry in the Diocese of London, excelling wherever she has been.'

He added: 'While we are very sorry to see her go, Gloucester has appointed someone with real quality and distinction. We look forward to continuing to support her in the years to come.'
