Towards the end of Manchester City’s win at Sunderland in midweek, a pitch invader dressed as Spider-Man was caught and led away by police. When Sergio Aguero is around, there’s only room for one superhero these days.

Aguero’s 19 goals from 20 games this season might suggest City are turning into a one-man team.

Sat in an executive box at the Etihad on Friday, winger Jesus Navas seemed less convinced.

So where would the champions be this season without their mercurial striker? ‘I couldn’t tell you,’ says Navas.

‘But what you have to remember is that we’re all working really hard in the same direction to take City up the league. We’re pushing forward all the time to create as many chances for him as possible.

‘It’s fantastic we’ve got Sergio among our ranks, a player like him can make the difference. 

'But we are really becoming a solid unit now, we are defending as a block. I think that’s helping the fact we’ve managed to turn the results around.’

Things are looking up for City compared to a few weeks ago, after four straight wins in all competitions.

The gap between Manuel Pellegrini’s side and Chelsea is down to six points ahead of Saturday’s game at home to Everton, and Aguero’s heroics against Bayern Munich has given them a fighting chance of qualifying for the knockout stage of the Champions League when they face Roma in Italy in a potential Group E decider on Wednesday.

There is a possibility captain Vincent Kompany and playmaker David Silva — who has missed the last six games — could return from injury at the Stadio Olimpico, Pellegrini said on Friday. 

The City boss also confirmed England goalkeeper Joe Hart is expected to sign a four-and-a-half-year contract worth £120,000-a-week in the coming days.

City certainly look back to their old selves after a disjointed start to the season. Navas believes they are capable of going on to retain the Barclays Premier League title and mount a serious challenge for the Champions League as well.

‘As long as we keep up this level of consistency, then why not? This is a really key period. There are lots of points up for grabs in December and then in Rome it’s a huge game. 

'If we can carry on playing in this manner it could be a crucial time for us for the rest of the season.’

For a player renowned for his blistering pace, Navas is taking things slowly however. Step by step. He insists that City dare not take their focus off Everton and look too far ahead to Roma.

‘No, definitely. The whole team will be focussed on Everton. We’re very much aware that we’re still six points behind Chelsea and we have to claw back the points. Tomorrow is the key.’
