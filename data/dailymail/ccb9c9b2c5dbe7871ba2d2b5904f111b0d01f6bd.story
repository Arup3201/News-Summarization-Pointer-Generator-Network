The teenage son of a former rock musician who travelled to Syria after marrying an Islamist extremist has been arrested over burning a Union Jack near the family's home in Kent. 

The 18-year-old was arrested alongside two 14-year-old's in Borough Green near Sevenoaks after allegedly climbing up the flag pole outside a library, setting fire to the Union Jack and spitting on it on October 27. 

Kent Police are now thought to be investigating whether the vandals were spurred on by a religious hatred of the West as it was revealed one is the son of jihadist Sally Jones who fled the UK last year. 

The 18-year-old's mother Sally Jones travelled to Syria last year to join ISIS militants after marrying an Islamic extremist she met on Twitter. Jones regularly posts on Twitter about her life in the northern city of Raqqa 

The son of jihadi bride Sally Jones was arrested alongside two other teenagers in October for burning and spitting on a Union Jack outside the Borough Green Library in Kent 

Forty-five-year-old Jones, a life-long benefit claimant, joined terrorists in the Middle East after marrying convicted computer hacker and Islamic extremist Junaid Huddsain, 20.

The couple, who met on Twitter, post regular threats to the West and recite Islamic prophecies on the micro-blogging site from their new home in Raqqa, northern Syria. 

CCTV footage from October 27 implicated the eldest of Jones's two sons in the flag-burning incident outside Borough Green Library, the Times reports. 

He was released on bail with two younger alleged accomplices.  

A Kent Police spokesman confirmed their arrests, saying: ''Two males, aged 14 and 18, remain on police bail until 20 December following a report of criminal damage in Borough Green, in which a flag is reported to have been burnt. 

'A third male, aged 14, was later arrested on 6 November and remains on bail. The three arrested people have had their bail extended until 20 December.'

Jones, a life-long benefits claimant, converted to Islam and fled the UK after marrying the extremist

The flag has since been replaced by workmen in the village, with residents shocked such vandalism was carried out in the run-up to Remembrance Day. 

Since converting to Islam, the teenager's mother has documented her aggressive allegiance with ISIS online. 

Posting under the Muslim name Umm Hussain Al-Britani, the 45-year-old regularly boasts of life in Raqqa, one of the terrorist group's most significant strong-holds. 

Jones, who is thought to have taken her youngest son with her to the war-torn country, married toyboy terrorist Junaid Hussain after meeting the 20-year-old on Twitter. 

Hussain was jailed in 2012 for hacking former prime minister Tony Blair's personal details and publishing them online. 

At the time he admitted making nuisance phone calls to jam terrorism hotlines. 

His lawyer claimed his actions were nothing more than a 'teenage prank', and were no worse than those of the Bullingdon Club - an Oxford university society to which David Cameron and Boris Johnson have been linked. 

The then 18-year-old was jailed for just six months.
