While it may look like a particularly gruesome DIY lobotomy, this Shaolin monk in Chinais showing how he has trained his body to withstand incredibly sharp objects. 

In a series of stunts that should most certainly not be tried at home, Zhao Rui held a running electric drill to the side of his head without breaking the skin, bent an iron bar against a wall with his throat, and led on metal spears while breaking stones with his head.

According to People's Daily Online, Zhao held the powerful drill against his temple for 10 seconds - but only left a small red mark where it had been.

The display was intended to show how the 24-year-old had trained his body during his years of martial arts training - and his skills have made him a celebrity in his home city of Mianzhu in south-western China's Sichuan province.

But the 24-year-old admitted that he has previously accidentally drilled a hole in his head when practising the stunt, ripping off a large piece of skin.

He said: 'It was pretty painful but I got better and I learned from the experience and now I can practice pretty often without any problems.'

And to prove the point he held a drill against his head for 10 seconds.

Bending the rules: He also bends iron bars between his throat and a wall

Scoring points: His routine also involves lying on metal spikes while breaking stones over his head

Eyewitness Lian Tang, 25, said: 'It was incredible because after he removed it, there was no blood, only a bright red mark where the drill head had been.'

The kung fu master started learning martial arts as a child after becoming fascinated with the discipline and at the age of 16 ran away to join a Shaolin Temple. 

He mainly wanted to learn Sanda (Chinese kick-boxing) and 'hard Qigong', which draws strength from the inner energy force known as qi.

He studied there for two years before leaving to continue his studies in kung fu from other masters - and now he is a master himself.

The drill is just one of the stunts he uses to demonstrate his skill, and he also can use his supertough skin to lie on sharpened spears without any of them piercing his body, or can bend an iron bar by pressing it between his throat and a wall.

He said: 'I believe in making my body super tough. Believe it or not I used to be quite nervous as a youngster but now that I can break stones with my head I have found it has given me lots of self-confidence.'
