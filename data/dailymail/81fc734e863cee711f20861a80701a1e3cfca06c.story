For a millionaire searching for proximity to power, a new real estate listing in Dallas has all of the extravagant qualities that they may be looking for.

The mansion is situated close to the house of former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods of Dallas, Texas.

Though the Bushes may be a draw, don't expect to chat across the yard as the vast estate is set on 25 acres of land - and on sale for $135million.

Quite the spread: The massive 42,496-square-foot home in Dallas is on sale for $135million

The Crespi Estate has been owned by multimillionaire, sports tycoon Tom Hicks for the past 16 years and served as a family property for the business mogul, his wife Cinda and their six children.

Mr Hicks once owned the Texas Rangers, 
the Dallas Stars and the Mesquite Championship Rodeo. He is also a 
former owner of Liverpool football club in the UK.

His net worth was reported previously as being $1.3billion but the most recent evaluation by Forbes cut that in half to $700million. 

The 42,496-square foot mansion is being sold by real estate agent Douglas Newby through his company Significant Homes.

Mr Newby told MailOnline: 'After raising six children in the home, the Hicks recently became ''empty-nesters'' and have decided to place their Dallas home on the market.'

He added: 'It is the most refined and sophisticated of estate homes. It is a classic American property that draws from several centuries of European design.'

Owner: The 25-acre property is on sale by sports team magnate Tom Hicks, and he is friends and neighbors with former President George Bush

The Crespi Estate is believed to be the largest estate property in the U.S. that is located so close to a major city.

It is nestled in the prestigious neighborhood of Mayflower Estates in the Preston Hollow estate area. 

Residents include billionaire and former presidential candidate Ross Perot, Dallas Cowboys owner Mark Cuban and actor Owen Wilson.

Downtown Dallas is around an eight-minute drive with its burgeoning art scene including the recent Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House created by architect Norman Foster.

Ground force: The original construction for the grand home began in 1939

The Crespi Estate is perfect for a buyer who takes pleasure in aesthetics. It was designed for the Italian cotton merchant of the same name by renowned Swiss architect Maurice Fatio in 1939.

Fatio was the most sought-after architect in New York in the 1920s and created properties for families including the Vanderbilts, the Duchess of Marlborough and banker and philanthropist Otto Kahn.

The estate features a main house, 
guest house and pool house each with several storys. The 
property is crafted from hand-carved stone and framed by magnolias.

There are extensive, manicured lawns and gardens set against the rugged Texas landscape. The home has its own vegetable garden for chefs to use and hidden paths for peaceful walks.

The formal rooms have a European grandeur to their design and have regularly received U.S. Presidents and foreign dignitaries.

The third-floor bedrooms are more intimate with dormer windows and pitched ceilings creating a cozy  New England cottage feel.

The Hicks family spent around $100million updating and preserving the original structures and on the additional buildings.

Crespi Estate was worked on by architect Peter Marino who has projects including the Palm Beach Opera House, the Four Seasons in New York and designer stores for Chanel, Louis Vuitton and other luxury brands around the world.

There has been a great deal of interest in the property locally, according to Mr Newby. Preston Hollow is known as one of the most densely populated communities of millionaires in the U.S.

The asking price is far higher than the government estimates of the property, as the Dallas Central Appraisal District valued it at $37million.
