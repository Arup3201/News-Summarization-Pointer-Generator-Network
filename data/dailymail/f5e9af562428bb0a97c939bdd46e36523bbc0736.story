Chelsea's Premier League game against Sunderland has been moved forward by one day to help Jose Mourinho's quest for Champions League glory.

The Blues were drawn to play Atletico Madrid in the semi-final of the competition with the first leg scheduled for Tuesday, April 22 in the Spanish capital.

That match was scheduled to take place just 48 hours after Chelsea's home game with Sunderland.
