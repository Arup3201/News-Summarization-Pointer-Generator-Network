No inauguration: President Chavez has not been seen since the December surgery

The inauguration for Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is to be postponed due to his ill health, the government announced yesterday.

President Chavez has not been seen since his cancer surgery on December 11 and is reported to be suffering from a ‘severe lung infection’ in addition to his surgery recovery.

The formal inauguration for the 58-year-old's fourth period as president was to be held in Caracas tomorrow and the delay has outraged the opposition which now insists upon a temporary replacement.

The socialist leader, who has been in power since 1999, was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in June 2011 and has been through four operations since.

Angry opposition leaders now insist that Mr Chavez must be sworn in before the National Assembly tomorrow  as laid out in the constitution, or temporarily step aside and leave an ally in power.

‘The commander president wants us to inform that, based on his medical team's recommendations, the post-operative recovery should extend past January 10, said Vice President Nicolas Maduro, Mr Chavez's chosen successor, in a letter read to the legislature.

‘As a result, he will not be able to be present at the National Assembly on that date.’

The letter said authorities would seek another date for the inauguration ceremony but did not say when it would take place or give a time frame for President Chavez's return from Havana, Cuba where he is recovering.

Rather than being sworn in by the legislature, he would take his oath at a later date before the Supreme Court, the letter said, as allowed by the constitution.

Government leaders insist Mr Chavez is completely fulfilling his duties as head of state, even though official medical bulletins say he has a severe pulmonary infection and has had trouble breathing.

In addition, Mr Chavez’s unprecedented has left many Venezuelans convinced he could be in his last days.

His
resignation or death would wreak havoc to politics in the oil-rich 
South American nation, where Mr Chavez currently enjoys a god-like 
status among his supporters.

His
critics call him a fledgling dictator who has squandered billions of 
dollars from crude sales while dashing the independence of state 
institutions.

The constitution does not specify what happens if the president does not take office on January 10.

The Supreme Court, controlled by Mr Chavez allies, called a news conference for later today where it is is widely expected to announce an interpretation of the constitution that will give Mr Chavez leeway to take office when he is fit to do so.

If he dies or steps aside, new elections would be called within 30 days. Before leaving for Havana in December, the president instructed his supporters to back Maduro in that vote if he were unable to continue.

Opposition leaders argue that Congress
chief and Mr Chavez ally Diosdado Cabello should take over, as mandated
by the constitution if the president's absence is formally declared.

Cabello has ruled that out, saying the president continues to be in charge.

‘Who
could have believed the opposition would be screaming for Diosdado 
Cabello to be given the presidency of the republic?’ he said during a 
rambunctious session of Congress. ‘That's crazy, the opposition is 
losing it.’

Meanwhile opposition deputies accused the Socialist Party of failing to follow Mr Chavez's instructions - a scene that would have been unimaginable before his prolonged absence.

‘President Chavez is the only one among you who has spoken clearly,’ said opposition leader Julio Borges.

He was drowned out by pro-Chavez deputies clapping and chanting the socialist leader's name and rebuffed by Cabello, who had long been considered a potential successor to Mr Chavez until he was passed over for Maduro.

‘It's not my fault you weren't chosen, don't take your frustration out on me,’ Borges quipped.

Another opposition deputy complained that during the debate a copy of the constitution was thrown across the chamber from the direction of the Socialist Party's deputies.

Maduro has taken over the day-to-day running of the government and looks set to continue in the role past Thursday.
