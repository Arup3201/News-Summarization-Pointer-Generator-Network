A 36-year-old woman convicted of a hate crime hoax in Nebraska hasn't shown up for jail time that she was required to serve because she didn't meet the conditions of her probation.

Charlie Rogers is a former University of Nebraska-Lincoln basketball player who was convicted of lying to police about being attacked by three masked men who carved anti-gay slurs into her skin. 

She has said she's a lesbian.

A prosecutor told the Lincoln Journal Star Thursday that Rogers' probation officer didn't sign a document that would have waived the 90-day jail term ordered at her April 2013 sentencing.

Rogers was immediately required to serve seven days in jail, which she fulfilled.

The terms of her probation included 250 hours of community service and a requirement to get a full-time job.

Chief Deputy County Attorney Pat Condon said Rogers didn't show up as required at 8 a.m. Thursday at Lancaster County Jail because her probation documents had been finished. 

A jailer said Rogers still wasn't in custody there on Friday.

Rogers' lawyer didn't immediately return a call from The Associated Press. 

The county's chief deputy probation officer has declined to talk about Rogers and her probation problems.

Prosecutors say Rogers reported in July 12, 2012, that the men who attacked her tried to set fire to her home before leaving. 

Failed: Rogers, once a star basketball player (picutred), had done less than 10 percent of the 250 community service hours she needed to finish during her probation at the end of 2013, court records show

A neighbor told police that Rogers crawled from her home naked, bleeding and screaming for help.

Rogers' story quickly fell apart, and prosecutors said she faked the attack because she thought it would inspire change in the treatment of gay people. 

Prosecutors said Rogers purchased zip ties, a box cutter and white gloves shortly before the attack, and that the evidence didn't support what she said had happened.

Judge Gale Pokorny read a message on her Facebook page shortly before the alleged attack, in which she wrote, 'So maybe I am too idealistic, but I believe way deep inside me that we can make things better for everyone. I will be a catalyst. I will do what it takes. I will. Watch me.'

Rogers has maintained her innocence.  

The reported attack provoked outrage and spread fear among Lincoln's gay community, and hundreds of people turned out for a rally outside the state Capitol. 

At the time, Lincoln was debating whether to adopt a proposed 'fairness ordinance' that would have banned discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, and tensions were high among those on both sides of the issue.
