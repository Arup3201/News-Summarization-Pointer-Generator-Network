She has had a traumatic time since photos emerged of her husband with his hand around her neck.

But Nigella Lawson would appear to have turned a corner after filing for divorce from millionaire art dealer Charles Saatchi, 70, last month.

With her head held high and the trace of a smile on her lips, the television cook, 53, looked happy and confident as she left a central London hairdresser’s on Saturday. Even the rain, which caused her to put her newly-done hair up in a chignon, couldn’t change her mood.

The same cannot be said of Mr Saatchi, who looked dishevelled after dining at Scott’s in Mayfair on Friday – the very restaurant where the ‘throttling’ scene took place only weeks before.

He appeared exhausted as he sucked on a cigarette in the street, and later as he sat in the back of a taxi his head was bowed.

In June Miss Lawson left the marital home following the very public assault, for which Mr Saatchi has accepted a police caution, and they have barely spoken to one another since. The couple were granted a decree nisi last month.

Earlier this week Nigella finally broken her silence two months after the distressing pictures emerged.

On Tuesday night, she returned to Twitter for the first time to share a photograph of a cake she'd made to mark the return of The Great British Bake Off.

She made no reference to the high-profile dispute, nor to her impending divorce from her art-collecting billionaire husband.

Ms Lawson returned to her micro-blogging account yesterday, writing: 'Yum: settling down to The Great British Bake Off with a slice of this blackcurrant Victoria sponge #GBBO'.

When one of her 430,000 followers asked whether she had baked the cake herself or bought it in a shop, she replied: 'I MADE IT - though it wouldn't get me far in the #GBBO!'

Since the pictures of Mr Saatchi with his hand on Ms Lawson's neck were published by a Sunday newspaper in June this year, the chef has made no public comment.

By contrast, the advertising mogul has repeatedly spoken out over the controversy - including an announcement that he was divorcing his wife of 10 years.
