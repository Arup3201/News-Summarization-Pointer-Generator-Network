They seem to be promoting a nutritious alternative to burgers and fries.

But adverts for healthy Happy Meals are not all they seem, an obesity conference heard.

They don’t lead to children choosing healthier food – and actually make them like fast food more, a Liverpool University study found.

Happy Meals don’t lead to children choosing healthier food – and actually make them want burgers and fries

The researchers said the finding shows the power of McDonald’s branding – and accused the fast food giant of quickly and cleverly getting round advertising rules.

McDonald's is frequently accused of helping to perpetuate childhood obesity.

A Happy Meal contains a main item (typically a hamburger, cheeseburger, or small serving of Chicken McNuggets), a side item (french fries, apple slices, or a salad in some areas), and a drink (milk, juice, or a soft drink). 

In some countries, more healthy options such as apple slices, a mini snack wrap or salads are available as options.  

In the study, 59 boys and girls aged between seven and ten years old were shown a series of adverts for toys.

They were then asked to choose a main course, drink and side order from the options available for McDonald’s Happy Meals. 

They were also asked how much they liked junk food.

The process was repeated two weeks later – but this time some of the toy commercials were substituted with ones for McDonald’s.

Despite being shown a Happy Meal made up of fish fingers, fruit and a bottle of water, the youngsters still favoured burgers and fries when asked to choose their own meal.

Plus, they said they liked fast food more after seeing the Happy Meal ads, the UK Congress on Obesity  in Birmingham heard. 

Researcher Emma Boyland said that showing fruit and water rather than milkshakes and chips meant the commercials ‘cleverly’ complied with regulations on the advertising of food to children.

She added that holes in the rules mean that fatty and sugary food can still be advertised during TV programmes like X Factor, despite them being watched by millions of children.

Dr Boyland said that in an ideal world, all advertising to children would be banned.

She said: ‘It sounds extreme to say you shouldn’t advertise to children but children don’t understand persuasion and advertisers shouldn’t be trying to sway children’s choices.’

McDonald’s said that it adheres to some of the most stringent marketing regulations in the world, it has worked hard to improve its menu and it does not advertise fatty and sugary foods to children. 

One in three children is overweight and obese by the time they leave primary school in the UK. 

Research published earlier this month found obese children are up to six times more at risk of high blood pressure – an adult condition commonly linked to heart disease.

Young obese girls have the biggest problem, with a 5.9-fold chance of developing it compared with those of healthy weight, while the risk is four times greater for obese boys.

The study from Germany also shows that children and teenagers who are overweight are more likely to have high blood pressure readings.
