Five children were among six people killed when the minibus they were travelling in collided with a lorry in north east France today.

The horrific accident took place near Troyes, capital of the Aube department in north-central France.

‘It was a lethal accident with multiple vehicles,’ said local prosecutor Alex Perrin, who said it happened on the minor 619 road in Courteranges around 3pm.

The minibus was carrying seven children and two teachers from the Seine-et-Marne department, east of Paris.

Francois Hollande, the president of France, said he ‘learned with great emotion of the terrible accident in the Courteranges.

’He expressed his ‘solidarity’ with all the families affected by the tragedy, saying that his Transport and Interior ministers would attend the scene.
