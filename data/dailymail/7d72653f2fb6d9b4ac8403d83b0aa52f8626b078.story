A one-legged man in China has become a local celebrity after building a career as a painter and decorator despite his disability.

Li Shuang, who lost two thirds of his left leg to a cancerous tumour in 2005, now employs a number of disabled people struggling to find work - and plans to expand.

Known to the people of Changchun, north east China, as 'Hoppy', he made a name for himself by offering to work for free.

When they saw that he was as good as able-bodied competitors, the work flowed in.

Li, 39, thought that he would be an unemployable cripple for life, unable to work and a burden on his family, when he was forced to amputate his leg.

'But sitting around moping and feeling sorry for myself is really not my style,' he declares.

He lost his left leg to a cancerous tumour almost a decade ago and feared he would never work again

Once he started working, employers realised he was as capable as his able-bodied competitors

'So I decided that one legged, or no legged, I was going to persevere and make something of my life. And that is what I did.'

Now, with a 40-strong team of employees, he is happier than ever - and he doesn't mind his nickname a bit.

His dream, he says, is to change society's view of disabled people.

He now employs a team of 40 people, including some disabled workers, which he hopes to expand

Li says his dream is to help offer the same opportunities he found to other people with disabilities

'They deserve the kind of chance that I found for myself,' said Li.

'My dream is to keep on expanding the business and keep on employing people who have disabilities who can't work anywhere else.

'This is a positive way of showing society that the handicapped have just as much to offer as anyone else.'
