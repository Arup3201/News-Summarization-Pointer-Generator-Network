Fleetwood Mac have announced they are canceling planned performances in Australia and New Zealand as bassist John McVie is treated for cancer.

Band members Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham released a statement today in which they apologies to fans who had bought tickets.

But they said they hoped 'fans everywhere will join us in wishing John and his family all the best.'

Band spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg did not specify what type of cancer McVie is being treated for and it is not known how serious his condition is .

Fleetwood Mac recently finished a 
European tour which included packed out performances in London where they were joined by former members Peter Green and McVie's ex wife Christine McVie.

The New Zealand and Australia shows were similarly eagerly anticipated and scheduled to run until Dec 7. 

The British-American band were formed in 1967 in London and Stevie Nicks and then boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham joined the line up in 1975.

Their album Rumours sold 40million and topped the U.S. chart for seven months - until Michael Jackson released Thriller it was the best-selling album of all time.

But their stardom was blighted by drink and drug-fuelled excesses and tragedy.

Former guitarist Danny Kirvan became and alcholic by the age of 22, developed mental health problems after he was sacked from the band for his increasingly erratic behaviour, and eventually became homeless on the streets of London.

In 2012 band member Bob Welch, 66, was found dead by his wife after writing a suicide note and shooting himself in the chest.

He had had spinal surgery three months previously and been told by doctors that he would not regain the use of his legs - he opted to kill himself rather than become a 'burden' to his wife Wendy.

And sadly though the band's longevity has led to the release of classics such as Don’t Stop, Little Lies and Go Your Own Way the infighting, partner-swapping and drug-taking of the Fleetwood 'family' has rarely been out of the headlines.

And the phenomena which Lindsey Buckingham dubbed 'The Curse of the Fleetwood Mac Guitarist’ started back in the late Sixties.

Indeed Welch's tragic death was preceded by another former Fleetwood guitarist just six months earlier when Bob Weston was found dead in his bed in his London flat from a haemorrhage aged just 64.

Peter Green founded Fleetwood Mac as a blues band in London in 1967 but by the time the band released its fourth album he had become dependent on LSD.

He also he grew a beard, began to wear robes and a crucifix and told the band’s manager he was Jesus.

He left the band in 1970 after rowing with drummer Mick Fleetwood who refused his request to donate all their royalties to charity following a drug-induced vision he had of an angel.

He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered financial problems which led to him working as a hospital porter and even a grave digger.

In 1977, police surrounded his house and he was arrested for threatening the band’s accountant, David Simmons, with a shotgun.

Bizarrely, the reason Green gave was that he was furious because Simmons kept sending him royalty cheques.

Another notoriously wild founder member Jeremy Spencer took a turn for the worse during a tour if the US in 1971 after taking the drug mescaline.

He later joined the Children of God, a sinister cult which used sex  to ‘show God’s love’ and win converts and refused to perform with the band again.

 After an astonishing 15 different personnel line-ups the bands recent reunion tours and the healing of old wounds appeared to have brought them success again prior to the news of McVie's diagnosis.

The band is still believed to be scheduled to perform in Las Vegas on 
Dec 30 but no announcement has yet been made about whether this will take place.
