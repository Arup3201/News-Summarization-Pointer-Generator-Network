Jordan Belfort is reportedly renting a $4 million beachfront mansion in California, despite owing nearly $100 million to his defrauded investor

Jordan Belfort's creditors have chased him down to a luxury $4 million California mansion that he is reportedly renting, despite owing nearly $100 million to defrauded investors.

Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese’s hit film Wolf of Wall Street, is being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s.

LR Credit previously obtained a judgment against Belfort in New York for $27,597 from unpaid retail purchases Belfort made during his hedonistic days, reports TMZ.

But Belfort, 50, fled to glitzy Manhattan Beach, where he reportedly rents a glamorous mansion, temporarily escaping LR Credit's judgment against him.

But now the collection agency has filed new legal documents to make their NY judgment enforceable in California. 

The
 former stockbroker was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to 
his victims as part of his sentencing in 2003, but so far, he has paid 
just $11.6 million - and most of that came from sales of his property.

Belfort set up the brokerage house Stratton Oakmont alongside Danny Porush. 

The 'boiler room' firm 
based on Long Island designed to 'pump and dump' shares by hyping their 
prospects and quickly cashing in once their price rose.

The
 pair managed to rake in $200million from the fraud, which they spent on
 cocaine, prostitutes and a yacht once owned by Coco Chanel.

However, after the FBI caught up with them in 1996, Belfort spent 22 months in prison while Porush was sentenced to 39 months.

Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, in which he is played by Leonard Dicaprio, is now being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s

Belfort has written a pair of 
memoirs detailing his past misdeeds, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2008 and
 2009's Catching the Wolf of Wall Street.

Red Granite Productions paid Belfort, 51, $1.045 million for the rights to his story in 2011.

But according to government documents, Belfort paid just $21,000 in restitution that year.

According to Belfort himself, he hasn't profited from his story.

'I
 am not making any royalties off the film or the books, and I am totally
 content with that. My income comes from new life, which is far better 
than my old one,' Belfort wrote on his Facebook page on December 29.

'For
 the record, I am not turning over 50% of the profits of the books and 
the movie, which was what the government had wanted me to do. Instead, I
 insisted on turning over 100% of the profits of both books and the 
movie, which is to say, I am not making a single dime on any of this. 
This should amount to countless millions of dollars and hopefully be 
more than enough to pay back anyone who is still out there,' he added.

New career: The former stockbroker owes victims $110 million and should be paying 50 per cent of his income as a public speaker in restitution

Prosecutors say Belfort
 is living off book royalties, the money from the film rights and fees 
from his burgeoning career as a motivational speaker.

In
 addition, say prosecutors, Belfort has skipped the country to 
Australia, complicating the government's efforts to track his income.

'We
 want to set the record straight,' Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the 
U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn told the Wall Street Journal. 'Belfort's making these claims, and they're not factual. He's in Australia and using that loophole to avoid paying.'

'The
 government has seen nothing to suggest that even 100 per cent of 
Belfort's profits from his book and the movie Wolf of Wall Street would 
yield, in his words, "countless millions," much less the approximately 
$100 million that is still owed to the victims,' he said.

Belfort's
 lawyer denies that charge, saying his client traveled to Australia for 
work reasons but lives in Manhattan Beach, California.

Dispute: Prosecutors say Belfort and his partner have relocated to Australia to avoid paying back what he owes, but his lawyer says the pair are based in California

Belfort's Facebook page
 tells a different story: photographs appear on his page dated from 
April 10 2013 through May and June. He then appears to head to London 
and Los Angeles before arriving back in Australia in November, where 
he's apparently spent most of his time up until now.

His most recent posts all come from Melbourne, Australia.

The U.S. government contends that 
Belfort must continue to pay 50 per cent of his income in restitution, 
but Belfort's lawyer says he is no longer obligated to comply with 
the court-ordered payment plan because his supervised release period is 
now over.

Belfort's lawyer, Nicholas De Feis, told the Wall Street Journal that his client has paid every restitution payment he owes.

'He's made payments as 
he was required to make payments and as he earned income,' said De Feis.
 'He has never run from his obligations.'
