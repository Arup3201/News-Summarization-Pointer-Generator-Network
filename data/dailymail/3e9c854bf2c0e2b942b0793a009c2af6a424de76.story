Vandals stole a bulldozer and drove it more than a mile to demolish a part of a concentration camp before setting fire to the machine to cover their tracks.

Some 500 yards of the perimeter fence of the Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp were demolished, as well as the gate to the underground complex it links to.

The ten miles of tunnels were built with slave labour at the cost of thousands of lives in an effort to hide German industry from Bomber Command. 

Burned out: The bulldozer was used to destroy part of Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp

Damage: Hundreds of yards of the site's perimeter fence were destroyed in the attack

Defilement: This is the damaged gate to the underground complex built with slave labour at the camp

Local police were keen to play down the possibility it was a racist incident saying that various signs had been left untouched and had been no racist symbols daubed anywhere. 

The Langenstein-Zwieberge site in central Germany was a sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp and housed 7,000 inmates from 23 countries at its peak between April 1944 and April 1945.

It has since been turned into a memorial to the 2,000 people killed there while building a huge network of underground tunnels designed to hide German industry from Allied bombers.

The thieves had broken into a construction site a mile from the former concentration camp, stolen a bulldozer and driven it all the way to Langenstein-Zwieberge before using it to attack the site.

The site was preserved as a memorial in 1949 and opened as a museum in 1976.

Last month thieves broke into the former Dachau concentration camp near the southern Germany city of Munich and stole the iron gate from the main entrance.

Bearing the infamous Nazi exhortation 'Arbeit macht Frei' (Work will set you free), the gate is still missing despite a 3,000 EUR (£2,368) reward posted for information leading to its recovery.
