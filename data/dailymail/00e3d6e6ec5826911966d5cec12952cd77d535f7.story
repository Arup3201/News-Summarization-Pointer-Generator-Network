A woman was faced with a 50/50 chance of survival after doctors failed to spot her rare heart condition on two separate occasions.

Hollie Sassienie and filmmaker husband Darren, from London, were expecting their first child after 10 years together. It should have been the happiest time of their lives.

'We were really excited. Our baby was planned, we were delighted and our families were over the moon for us,' says Hollie, an entrepreneur and conference organiser for 
the Economist, now 32.

Hollie Sassienie and filmmaker husband Darren, from London, were expecting their first child after 10 years together

'We busied ourselves with work, by that time we worked for ourselves from home, planning out the nursery and thinking of names.

'Just before I fell pregnant, I'd been to the doctor as I'd been feeling really quite breathless and was worried that I could never seem to quite catch my breath, but the doctor told me it was anxiety and not to worry.'

All Hollie's scans progressed normally and the first half of her pregnancy went without any major problems. 

But one day, when she was in her 21st week of pregnancy, Hollie suddenly fainted at home. 

Concerned, she saw her GP who ran a series of tests. Nothing came up as abnormal and she was told to go home and rest.

At 29 weeks Hollie passed out six times and had a fit. She went to hospital but was told to go home

By 24 weeks Hollie was extremely breathless.

'I couldn't make it up the stairs without having to sit down half way to try and catch my breath,' she says.

'I couldn't even make it to the toilet in the night without gasping for air. It was really quite scary, but everyone reassured me it was simply the growing baby taking up space and pressing under my ribcage that was making me lose my breath.

'I'm asthmatic anyway so thought that it could have been that having an effect too. 

'I saw other mothers in the second trimester looking and feeling great, with bags of energy - not me. I spent more and more time resting. I couldn't walk our dog. It was all I could do to make it out of bed.'

At 29 weeks Hollie took a turn for the worse.

Over the course of a weekend she passed out six times. and at 5am one Sunday morning she started fitting after trying to make it from the bathroom back to bed. 

Darren, woken by the noise, rang for an ambulance immediately. Paramedics quickly arrived, checked Hollie over and took her to the local hospital where she was declared well enough to go home and rest.

The following day while in bed, Hollie passed out again, vomited and suffered diarrhoea. Admitted to Watford General for a second time, her obstetrician recommended a cardiologist run an echo and ultrasound on her heart to rule out any complications.

Hollie was advised that the 29-week-old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered in 48 hours

The news was bleak.

Hollie had pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition that hardens the arteries from the lungs to the heart.

Women suffering it are advised not to fall pregnant as their mortality rate climbs to 50 per cent. 

Hollie was advised that the 29-week-old baby she was carrying would in all likelihood be delivered by C-section in the next 48 hours to increase her own chances of survival. 

First, she was rushed to a specialist unit at Hammersmith Hospital some 30 miles away. 

'It was scary but I don't think I really realised the seriousness of the condition,' says Hollie.

'It wasn't until I opened my eyes at about 2am in the morning and found my parents, siblings and husband sat round my bed, all with ashen faces, that it started to sink in just how critical my condition was.

Hollie responded really well to the infusion of drugs to the heart, so was able to give birth at 34 weeks

'When the care team explained that I needed to get all my affairs in place as I might not get through the delivery, it really hit home just how ill I actually was.

'Luckily I responded really well to the infusion of drugs they were pumping straight into my heart to reduce its size and give me the best chance of survival.  I was still very breathless, but the signs were improving.'

Baby Gabriella was eventually delivered by C-section at 34 weeks, weighing 5lb 2oz.

Gabriella, now 14 months old, was taken to the hospital next door, Queen Charlotte's, while Hollie was rushed back to intensive care where she spent the next 10 days. 

Hollie takes strong medication every day and it's likely she will require a heart and lung transplant in the future

Two women with the same condition had previously died on day five and seven after being diagnosed, but Hollie pulled through that critical period and was allowed home a week later.

'Knowing Gabriella was already home and waiting for me really spurred me on to get better. 

'I had to learn to walk again and still had a cocktail of drugs being injected straight into my heart every day, but that feeling of being home is the best ever.

Gabriella, now 14 months old, was delivered by C-section at 34 weeks, weighing 5lb 2oz

'My husband Darren was the only one who really knew how scared I was during that whole time.  He was brilliant and couldn't have been more positive.

'He was talking to specialists and sufferers all over the world to ensure we were armed with all the information we needed.

'His support and the love and care of my family, combined with wanting to meet my baby, gave me the strength I needed to get through that incredibly difficult time.'

Hollie takes strong medication every day and it's likely will require a heart and lung transplant in the future.

Housebound for the first 10 months after diagnosis, she came up with the idea of Sassy Bloom, a monthly gift box for new mums containing unique, practical and beautiful gifts for mum and baby. 

'I am hoping the business will do well so we can give something back and help further the research,' she says.

Hollie's life expectancy has increased from 3-5 years to 10 years and more, and recently she was delighted to meet a mother who had lived with the condition for over 20 years. 

'Today is a beautiful day. I am well, I have a wonderful daughter, amazing husband and fabulous family and a new business that I manage from home,' says Hollie.
