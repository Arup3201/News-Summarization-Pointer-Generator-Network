Four climbers have been killed in an avalanche in the Scottish Highlands today.

The two men and two women died after their party of six climbers was caught up in the 'serious' avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in Glencoe at around 2pm this afternoon. Another woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries, and one man was found safe.

Emergency services were alerted when another pair of climbers stumbled across one of the casualties lying in the snow, Glencoe mountain rescue said.

The injured woman was taken to Belford Hospital in Fort William where her condition is said to be 'very serious'. The male survivor, who had stayed on the mountain to help rescue workers search for the missing members of his party, is 'safe and well', police said.

John Grieve, leader of Glencoe mountain rescue team, which co-ordinated the search, said the alarm was initially raised by the two climbers - who were not part of the group of six - when they discovered one of the casualties.

But, soon after, police were contacted by the male survivor from the climbing party, who told them more people were missing.

The climbers are thought to have been
descending a ridge known as Church Door Buttress, just beneath the 
summit of Bidean Nam Bian, when the natural disaster struck.

It is thought a snow slope broke away and swept five of the climbers down the mountain, killing four and leaving the female climber severely injured. The male survivor managed to escape the falling snow and ice and alerted police.

Mr Grieve, who is in Spain and was not part of the search, said: 'The first call to police was from two other people who had been on the mountain, they found someone lying next to where they were climbing.

'So, the assumption was that it was just one casualty, but it became clear that there were others missing when they heard from the man who is safe.'

He said the deceased climbers were located using a technique called 'probing', where a metal stick is pushed into the snow.

'To lose four people from a party of six is truly devastating'

'I'm not sure how deeply buried they were, but using that technique would suggest it was more than a metre,' Mr Grieve said.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond described the incident as an 'appalling tragedy', adding 'our immediate thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have been lost'.

'To lose four people from a party of six is truly devastating,' Mr Salmond said.

David Gibson, from the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said: 'This was a significant tragedy.

'The thoughts of the MCoS are with all of those involved and the rescue services up there doing the job they do.

'It is always difficult in these circumstances, but I think the advice we would give to people is to check the weather and avalanche forecasts before setting off, and to assess the risks.'

Mr Gibson said Bidean Nam Bian is a munro - a mountain with a height in excess of 3,000ft - with a number of different climbs.

Scotland, like much of Britain, has been battered by heavy snow and strong winds in recent days.

Northern Constabulary said in a statement: 'Police can confirm that four people have lost their lives in the Glencoe avalanche this afternoon.

'Four people, two men and two women were found by searchers and have now been pronounced dead.

'One woman from the party of six remains in a very serious condition at Belford Hospital. The sixth climber who raised the alarm is safe and well and being assessed and cared for by emergency services.

'Police are making efforts to identify the deceased and to contact next of kin,' the statement added.

Concerned family members can telephone the Force Control Room on 01463 715555 if they are concerned about relatives climbing in the area.
