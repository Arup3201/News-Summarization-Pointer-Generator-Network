'He hogs it': Library director Marie Gandron wants to end 9-year-old Tyler Weaver's five year reign over her library's children's reading contest

A fifth grade boy just won his public library’s children’s reading club contest for the fifth year in a row but instead of congratulating him, his librarian wants him banned from the contest.

Hudson Falls Public Library Director Marie Gandron says 9-year-old reading ace Tyler Weaver ‘hogs’ the annual competition and needs to step aside.

The self-proclaimed ‘king of the reading club’ read 63 books for this summer’s Dig Into Reading event between June 24 and August 3 and his unparalleled prowess has the other children scrambling to keep the pace.

‘Other kids quit because they can’t keep up,’ Gandron told the Post-Star.

Over
the last five years of contests, Tyler has devoured an impressive 373 
books at or above his reading level. He accepted his fifth title on 
August 15.

Tyler has 
won the coveted prize every year since kindergarten. He’s proud of his 
accomplishments and he’s not shy about saying it.

‘It feels great,’ Tyler said. ‘I think that was actually a record-breaking streak.’

Tyler’s mom Katie concurs.

‘I
don’t see the downside of Tyler winning five years in a row. I think 
people should be proud of him, especially a library director,’ she said.

Prizes he’s received over the years include an atlas, water bottle, and t-shirt.

‘They’re really not any grand things. I think he just likes to be the top reader,’ said Katie.

Menace? 9-year old Tyler Weaver is about to start fifth grade and has won his library's reading contest since kindergarten. But his library's director thinks it is time for him to relinquish his crown

Feud: The picturesque Hudson Falls Library may be pretty on the outside, but strife in the children's section is making things ugly on the inside

But Gandron doesn’t seem to like it. Until Katie made the controversy public, Gandron wanted to change the rules so that winners are drawn from a hat instead of chosen by number of books read.

And this isn’t the first time the library director and Katie have been embroiled in a reading contest dispute.

Gandron told the Post-Star that Tyler’s mother has a bad ‘attitude’ toward the reading contest because several years ago a little girl claimed to have read 200 books. Though the mother backed up her daughter’s claims, it turned out they were both lying.

‘That’s when we stopped [going on the parents’ word] because she wasn’t [reading the books],’ Gandron said.

Rigged? Katie Weaver, right, says her son deserves to keep competing. But Gandron says Tyler's mom has an 'attitude' about the contest because of cheating by other kids in previous years

Now the participants are quizzed on each book they claim to have read to ensure they’re telling the truth.

The debate over Tyler’s reading award has caused internal strife at the library, as well.

Library aide Lita Casey, who Tyler calls ‘Gram,’ has taken Tyler’s side over her boss’s and says Tyler won the contest fair and square.

‘My feeling is you work, you get it. That’s just the way it is in anything,’ said Casey, who’s worked at the library for 28 years.

Dynasty: Though Katie has threatened to take her son's talents elsewhere, Tyler's brother Jonathan, right, may continue the family's reign--he's won second place for the last two years

It remained unclear how the feud would be resolved. But Katie maintains she’ll be taking her son’s reading skills elsewhere—to the Crandall Public Library in Glens Falls.

Meanwhile, taking Tyler out of the running won’t necessarily end Gandron’s troubles.

There may be a dynasty emerging in Tyler’s 7-year-old brother Jonathan, who has now won second place for two years in a row.
