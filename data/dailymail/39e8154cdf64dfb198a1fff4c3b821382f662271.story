What do you do when you are in some of the world's most beautiful locations, and your wife doesn't want a photo.

One husband found a novel way to overcome the problem, but using a teddy bear instead.

Amateur photographer Christian Kneidinger has taken extensive holiday snaps of his bear in more than 21 breathtaking destinations. 

Photographer Christian Kneidinger has travelled to some of the most beautiful locations in the world, but his camera-shy wife was not keen to make the family album...luckily he had his teddy to step in

The album was put together after wife Ranati, 51, refused to be featured in any holiday snaps, but the couple still wanted a personal touch on the landscape pictures 

The bear has posed on volcanic rock in Iceland, sat at the base of a stunning waterfall in Mauritius, and sunbathed on the beaches of Dubai.

The Austrian father-of-two said said: 'Photography is my passion and I was keen to capture these moments of stunning natural beauty.

'I asked my wife to be in the pictures but she wouldn't do it so I decided to do it with 'Teddy' instead.'

Instead of wife Ranati in his holiday photo albums, his golden bear is pride of place. 

The landscapes captured are visually stunning, but adding his teddy has given a personal touch to the places Christian, 51, has travelled to. 

The photographs include the teddy donning a bandana on a beach in Dubai, with the iconic Burj al Arab hotel in the background. 

Amateur photographer Kneidinger has positioned Teddy in some of the most beautiful locations on earth from glaciers to mountain tops

Father-of-two, Christian, who is from Austria, said: 'Photography is my passion and I was keen to capture these moments of stunning natural beauty.' I asked my wife to be in the pictures but she wouldn't do it so I decided to do it with 'Teddy' instead'
