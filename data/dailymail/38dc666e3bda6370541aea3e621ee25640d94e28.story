Nick Clegg today unveiled his Lib Dem election team, as rivals began plotting to replace him as leader.

In the biggest demotion, Vince Cable has been dumped as the party's main economic spokesman as Mr Clegg named his 'Liberal Democrat Cabinet'.

But with the Lib Dems fifth in the polls behind Ukip and the Greens, senior figures including Ed Davey made clear their leadership ambitions if Mr Clegg is forced to 'hang up his clogs'.

Mr Clegg announced that Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will take the lead on the economy, a job given to Mr Cable before the 2010 election.

However, Mr Alexander has been accused of 'going native' in the Treasury, seen by some as too close to Tory Chancellor George Osborne. 

Mr Cable will be responsible for business policy, but in the list of names released today was placed fifth in seniority, behind the likes of Lynne Featherstone and Tim Farron. 

A source close to Mr Clegg insisted that the two men were simply 'mirroring the jobs they've done for the last five years'. 

'We are lucky in the party to have two such strong voices on the economy', the source added.

Aides to Mr Cable stressed that he would still be speaking on the economy in his role covering business, innovation and skills. 

Mr Clegg said: 'This is a team that will never pander to the politics of grievance, fear and blame but instead work every day to keep Britain anchored in the centre ground.

'Over the coming months, they will prove that the Lib Dems are the only party that can balance the budget, cut taxes for 30 million people, invest in health and education and protect our environment.'

Mr Alexander is seen as a leading contender to replace Mr Clegg if he is ousted after the general election.

Allies of the Lib Dem leader believe Mr Alexander has been 'positioning' for the role for more than a year.

Last night Energy Secretary Ed Davey threw his hat into the ring, declaring his willingness to lead the party if it 'falls' to him.

He told LBC radio: 'If it turns out when Nick Clegg hangs up his clogs as leader … whether that's directly after the next election – I doubt it – or in a few year's time – more likely – when he does that, of course there will be colleagues like myself and others, who will think about whether they want to stand for leader. That's not unreasonable.'

He added: 'If one day it falls to me to lead it, then obviously, I'd like to do that.'

Mr Davey will speak for the party on energy and climate in the run-up to the election, 

Grassroots favourite Mr Farron, widely regarded as a favourite to become leader, will be responsible for foreign affairs while Ms Featherstone will cover home affairs. 

Two ministers sacked by Mr Clegg during the coalition are offered a comeback. Sir Nick Harvey returns to speak on defence while Michael Moore, ousted as Scottish Secretary in 2013, will cover Europe. 

General Election Coordinator Paddy Ashdown added: 'If in Government after the General Election this team will finish the job and make sure Britain doesn't lurch to the Right or Left.

'We all know Labour are a risk to the economy and the Tories will cut too much, threatening the NHS and sacrificing the least well off.'
