Falklands veterans who arrived  to 'clean up' after the war ended have finally been given their campaign medals after 32 years.

David Cameron handed the servicemen the South Atlantic Medal in Downing Street today after a long-awaited review  found they should have been recognised for their service in 1982.

The men all arrived on the islands more than a month after Argentine forces surrendered Port Stanley on June 14, 1982.

Although the war was over, their work was not without its dangers.

They had to deal with landmines and the graves of the war dead, and one  soldier, Gurkha Lance-Corporal Budhaparsad Limbu, died when his spade hit a grenade two weeks after the surrender.

For decades the only veterans who could claim the South Atlantic Medal were those who had been on the islands up to July 12, 1982.

But this year a long-awaited independent review ruled that time should be extended by three months to October 21, 1982.

It now covers veterans who served up to when an airfield at what is now RAF Mount Pleasant, opened in 1985, was completed as part of Britain's efforts to strengthen the islands against future attacks.

The review by the former British Ambassador to France, Sir John Holmes, was controversial with many other servicemen - because it left out veterans of conflicts including Aden, Suez and Korea.

It declared new medals would be awarded to those who served in Cyprus and the Berlin Airlift - when the Allies flew supplies to people in West Berlin in 1948 and 1949.

Other conflicts were not mentioned in the review, whose aim was 'to draw a definitive line under issues which in some cases had been controversial for many years'.

Falklands veterans welcomed today's ceremony.

Kev Greathurst,  Dorset and Somerset co-ordinator for the South Atlantic Medal Association, told MailOnline: 'It's been a long time coming.

Honour: Derek Selwood with his medal. One veteran said: 'The jobs these guys had to do were horrendous'

Campaign: Mark Willoughby with the Prime Minister. The veterans were of varying ages and experience

Return: Steven Rue. The review was designed to 'draw a line' under all historic claims on campaign medals

'There was still danger in the form of minefields which are still there to this day. A Gurkha was killed after the conflict ended doing trench clearance.'

The 56-year-old added: 'Some of the jobs those guys had to do afterwards were horrendous.

'They had to clean up the mess left by the invasion. They were digging up and finding the dead. In Stanley, some of the Argentine forces had defecated in drawers and on plates.'

Midlands co-ordinator Les Palmer, 61, added: 'Although the conflict had stopped there was still significant danger. A lot of ships still went down.

'My mate was one of those who missed out. He didn't get the medal because he got there one day too late. At the time they certainly felt like they weren't being recognised'. 

Criteria: The medal is now given to soldiers who served until an airfield at RAF Mount Pleasant (above) was built

Hidden danger: There are still minefields in the islands feared never to have been cleared, veterans said
