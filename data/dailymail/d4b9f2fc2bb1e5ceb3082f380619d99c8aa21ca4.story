South Africa's Tim Clark shot a final-day 65 to snatch a victory away from Jim Furyk at the Canadian Open and earn his second PGA title.

Furyk led by three shots going into the last round as he sought a third Canadian Open crown but the veteran American could only card a one-under-par 69 to open the door to nearest challenger Clark at Royal Montreal Golf Club.

And the 38-year-old took full advantage with a five-under round that saw him come back in just 30 - thanks to a superb spell of putting - to finish on a 17-under total of 263, equalling the tournament record, and one shot clear of Furyk.

Clark had a poor start to the rain-affected final day with a bogey on the par-four first, but he cancelled that out on the sixth to reach the turn in level par, before hitting a hot streak that brought him further birdies on the 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th and 17th.

Furyk, champion in 2006 and 2007, could not compete with that, managing his only back-nine birdie on the penultimate hole as Clark added the Canadian Open title to his triumph at The Players Championship in 2002.

Justin Hicks was three shots behind Furyk in third after closing with an impressive 64, with fourth place being shared between Matt Kuchar (65), Michael Putnam (66) and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano (66) on 11 under.

Dicky Pride played the round of the day as his seven-under-par 63 matched the course record - which was also equalled by Furyk on Friday. That left Pride on 10 under, alongside local hope Graham DeLaet.

Former US Open champion Graeme McDowell was in the group on nine under, while Scottish duo Martin Laird and Russell Knox finished on five under - all three players carding final-day 68s.
