Two thugs involved in an attack on an innocent man in the street which put him in hospital for a month were spared prison after telling a judge they were sorry for their actions.

Quite how long that remorse lasted is apparent from this picture.

Emerging from court, Daniel Chrapkowski gleefully punched the air with both hands and danced on the steps, while his accomplice Thomas Lane made an obscene gesture and squared up to reporters and photographers.

Yob: Daniel Chrapkowski celebrates outside Manchester Crown Court after he escaped jail for his part in the drunken street attack

Glee: Thomas Lane swears at photographers as he leaves the court with a non-custodial sentence

Their victim, Joseph O’Reilly, 24, yesterday said he felt ‘angry and frustrated’.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘It makes my 
blood boil to think that they were rejoicing when they came out of 
court. I cannot believe the way they are behaving.

‘One of them looks as if he has just 
won an award, not escaped prison for a vicious beating. The other one 
looks like he doesn’t give two hoots about what happened.

Victim: Joseph O'Reilly, 24, was savagely set upon by the three drunken yobs after asking why they were kicking wheelie bins around Manchester city centre

'These two are a disgrace. It’s as if 
they’ve just been let off their crime and they haven’t been punished at 
all – yet I’ve had to serve my own sentence because of my injuries.

‘The fact they were celebrating proves they assumed they were going to go to jail – yet the judge just let them go.’

Manchester Crown Court heard that the 
attack happened in January last year after Mr O’Reilly, an office 
worker, had been for a night out in the city centre with his girlfriend 
Lucy Blackledge, 22, a sales adviser.

They were heading for home when they spotted a gang  walking towards them, kicking over bins and scattering rubbish in the road.

When Mr O’Reilly asked them: ‘What on Earth are you doing?’, they turned on him and his girlfriend.

Lane started ‘shadow boxing’ in front 
of Mr O’Reilly before Chrapkowski punched him in the face then tripped 
him, causing him to fall to the pavement.

Mr O’Reilly was repeatedly punched and
kicked in the face and stomach before the gang ran off. He spent more 
than 40 hours undergoing X-rays and scans as well as emergency treatment
for his injuries.

He suffered a badly fractured jaw and a bleed on the brain, and was forced to have a metal plate fitted into his face.

Months after the attack he had to go 
back into hospital after collapsing and he still suffers severe dizzy 
spells and numbness in his mouth.

A year on Mr O’Reilly says he can chew food on only one side and worries about going out alone from his home in east Manchester.

In sentencing the gang, Judge Martin Steiger said the trio had been drinking a 'considerable amount'

Tattooed, jobless Chrapkowski, 24, 
from Stockport, was given a 12-month suspended prison term, 
electronically tagged for two months and ordered to complete 160 hours 
unpaid work after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm.

Lane, a sign
writer, also 24 and from Stockport, insisted he made no physical 
contact with the victim.

He admitted affray and was given a 
community order for 12 months, ordered to complete 120 hours unpaid 
work, abide by a curfew and pay £250 costs.

A third man, Oliver O’Neill, 23, from 
Bramhall – who was on bail for another vicious attack at the time of the
assault on Mr O’Reilly – was jailed for 27 months after admitting two 
counts of GBH.

Katie Jones, defending Chrapkowski, 
said: ‘He is extremely remorseful and wishes to apologise to the court. 
It is extremely out of character.’

Paul Hodgkinson, defending Lane, said:
‘He accepts he had been out drinking and engaging in tomfoolery, but 
that mischief doesn’t cross the custody threshold.’

Judge Martin Steiger QC said: ‘Drink 
was involved and in particular I bear in mind that O’Neill was 
responsible for significant bodily harm.’
