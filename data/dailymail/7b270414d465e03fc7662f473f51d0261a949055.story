Lazar Markovic has been handed a four-game ban for his red card in December's Champions League group clash with Basle at Anfield.

The Liverpool winger was set to discover the length of his European suspension for the incident, in which his outstretched hand touched the face of Behrang Safari, after UEFA's disciplinary committee meet on Thursday.

But Markovic hinted he had already discovered his fate and appeared to express his shock at the harsh punishment when he tweeted '4?' on Tuesday. The message was accompanied by a picture of HIM looking bemused during a Liverpool match.

UEFA have the £20million Serbian winger down for a four-match suspension on official lists.

Markovic, 20, had only been on the pitch for 15 minutes when he was sent off against Basle. He has been given an extra game on top of the normal three-match ban for violent conduct because he was sent off playing for Benfica in a Europa League match last May.

Markovic had already been substituted in the Europa League semi-final against Juventus but was sent off by Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg for his part in a touchline fracas.

The red card meant he missed the final against Sevilla, which the Spanish side won on penalties.

Liverpool opted not to appeal UEFA's decision and Markovic will miss both legs of the last-32 Europa League clash against Besiktas, the first of which is at Anfield on Thursday, as well as the home and away last-16 matches should they progress.

Markovic's dismissal against Basle was one element of a thoroughly disappointing night for the club, with a 1-1 draw not enough to see them progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League.

Manager Brendan Rodgers was unhappy with the red card, saying after the match: 'I thought the sending off was a really disappointing decision by the referee.

'Lazar Markovic gets sent off for that - his fingernail barely touches the nose of the defender and the defender is the guy who should be looked at for his reaction.'
