A six-year-old girl from Missouri, who lost part of her leg when she was run over by a lawnmower, will be able to walk again thanks to a rare surgical procedure.

Isabella Smith's left leg was mangled by the mower after her grandfather accidentally went over her as she played in his garden on May 1.

The damage was so severe that at first surgeons thought they may have to amputate it from the hip but, thanks to a rarely performed operation, the little girl will soon be back on her feet.

Isabella has had seven operations already on her leg since arriving at the University of Kansas hospital by air ambulance at the start of the month.

When her grandfather, John Williams, realized he had run over the six-year-old he used his belt as a tourniquet and told Isabella's grandmother to stay away because of the shocking injuries.

The mower had ripped a large hole in her leg, damaging bone and muscle and making doctors question whether they could save the limb.

Eventually, they decided to use rotationplasty - an eight-hour procedure in which a section of the leg around the knee joint is removed, and the lower leg is rotated and reattached so the foot is facing backwards.

Doctors say that the procedure is the best hope Isabella will have of walking again, because the ankle will work as a knee joint and fit into a prosthetic.

When asked if she understood what was going to be done to her, Isabella said: 'Yeah, it means my foot is going to be in a different place ... Will I be able to run?'

The little girl's courageous attitude has helped her family get through the trauma of the past few weeks.

Rotationplasty is a complicated procedure in which part of the leg is removed and then reattached to the body.

It is usually performed on young cancer patients because it allows tumors to be removed without the need for amputation.

A section of the leg around the knee joint is removed.

The lower part of the leg is then rotated and reattached to the body, so the foot is facing backwards.

This allows the ankle joint to simulate the way a knee moves, making learning to walk on a prosthetic easier.

Nerves in the foot also continue to send signals to the brain about movement.

Inplants are added to the new top half of the leg so that the reattached limb can be adjusted as the child grows.

'I was supposed to be strong for her, but it was the other way around,' her mom, Stephanie Williams, told the Kansas City Star.

'I’ve gone through every emotion, and the one thing I’ve learned is that crying doesn’t help. I’m trying to be like her.'

Ms Williams had been on the first day of a vacation to Jamaica when her daughter was injured.

Her parents tried to hide the extent of Isabella's injuries from her, telling Ms Williams only that she needed to return as soon as possible.

'They didn't want us to travel all day 
knowing how bad it was. They just told us that she had been in an 
accident and we'd need to come right home,' Ms Williams told KSHB.

The procedure Isabella is having done is usually performed on young cancer patients as a way to remove tumors without them losing their whole leg.

Surgeons who carry out the complicated operation, which involves attaching the shin to the thigh, and then making sure all the nerves and muscles meet up, usually have at least a month to prepare.

But in Isabella's case, they had just two days. 'We didn't have a lot to work with,' orthopedic surgeon Kim Templeton said.

The surgeon added: 'You get to keep and use as much of the real leg as possible. It takes less energy to get used to and allows someone to be more active and functional.'

Isabella is still recovering from the operation, but in about two months she will have a prosthetic fitted and begin to learn to walk again.

A fund has been set up to help with her hospital and rehabilitation costs, and to pay towards the $20,000 prosthetic and alterations to the family home to help her move around more easily.

A PayPal account has been set up in the family's name, and can be reached via IzzysSquad415@gmail.com.
