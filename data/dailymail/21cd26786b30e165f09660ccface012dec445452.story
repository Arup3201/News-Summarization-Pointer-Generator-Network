Urban Outfitters has been forced to apologize for designing a Kent State sweatshirt splattered with fake blood in what appeared to be a reference to the massacre of 1970.

Four students were killed and nine severely wounded in the shooting after the Ohio National Guard opened fire at a protest against President Nixon's Cambodian Campaign.

But 44 years later it seems the tragedy has served as fashion inspiration for the high street store which released a 'vintage' sweatshirt covered in red blotches with holes by the left shoulder.

'Tasteless': Urban Outfitters has come under fire for stocking this 'vintage' Kent State University sweatshirt that appears to be covered in blood stains in an apparent reference to the May 4 Massacre in 1970

Horrific: The Ohio National Guard fired 67 shots in 13 seconds at unarmed students during a protest in 1970

The Ohio university blasted the item as 'beyond poor taste', while survivors of the attack accused the retailer of exploiting tragedy for publicity and profit.

The company has now pulled the sweatshirt from its website, and issued an apology.

A spokesman for the store said: 'Urban Outfitters sincerely apologizes for any offense our Vintage Kent State Sweatshirt may have caused.

'It was never our intention to allude to the tragic events that took place at Kent State.'

The original listing described the sweater as: 'Washed soft and perfectly broken in, this vintage Kent State sweatshirt is cut in a loose, slouchy fit. Excellent vintage condition. We only have one, so get it or regret it!'

The Kent State shootings, also known as the May 4 Massacre, tore through a peaceful protest held by unarmed students at the university in Kent City, Ohio. 

Officers fired 67 shots in 13 seconds, killing four and wounding nine - one of whom was left permanently paralyzed. 

Some of the dead and wounded had not been involved in the demonstration, held four days after President Nixon announced the Cambodian Incursion - despite pledging to end the Vietnam war in 1968.  

A statement published on the Kent State University website read: 'We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit. 

'This item is beyond poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still hurts the Kent State community today.'  

Outrage: The jersey with stains and holes appears to mock the shooting, which left one student paralysed

Tragic: Four students died at the protest against the Cambodian Incursian announced days before by Nixon

Statement: Kent State University in Kent City, Ohio, has condemned the design as 'beyond poor taste'

Alan Canfora, one of the nine people wounded at Kent State in 1970, said on Monday he had spoken to family members of the victims and they are very upset at Urban Outfitters and do not accept the company's apology.

'This was a crass attempt at free publicity and a very morbid offering to stir up controversy,' Canfora said.

People took to social media in outrage to condemn the 'disgusting' Urban Outfitters design, which is now listed as 'sold out' on the website.

One wrote: 'Can't believe Urban Outfitters new Kent State sweatshirt with blood stains, who was sleeping when that design was approved?!'

Another said: 'Urban Outfitters Red-Stained Kent State Sweatshirt... VERY BAD TASTE'

And one commented: 'Ugh. @UrbanOutfitters celebrates my alma mater with a Kent State shooting blood-soaked vintage sweatshirt' 

Anger: Twitter users, including this Kent State alumnus, blasted the retailer's new controversial design

Disgusted: One user wrote 'VERY BAD TASTE' in response to the $129 sweater, which is now sold out

Confusion: Many expressed their disbelief that senior management allowed the design to be released

Controversy: The store has previously come under fire for allegedly glamorizing eating disorders with an 'eat less' t-shirt (left) last year and mental health issues with a 'depression' crop top (right) in January

The incident is the latest in a series of controversial Urban Outfitters designs.

In June, critics blasted the retailer for stocking pens shaped like heroin-filled needles.

Earlier this year, the store was accused of mocking mental health disorders by stocking a crop top printed with the word 'depression' - described on the site as a 'super depressing tee from Depression topped with an allover logo graphic.'

It came just two years after the firm was forced to pull a t-shirt printed with the words 'eat less' that critics claimed glamorized eating disorders. 

The cotton v-neck top was modelled by a slim, gaunt young woman and paired with a black mini-skirt.

Youth retailer Urban Outfitters operates under the slogan: 'Because living life the conventional way is depressing.' 

Urban Outfitters did not respond to Mail Online's request for a comment.
