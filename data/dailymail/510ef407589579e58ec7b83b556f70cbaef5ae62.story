Christianity has declined sharply over the past decade, according to the census returns. Numbers who choose to call themselves Christians fell by more than four million.

The collapse in belief in the religion which has been central to the history of the country for 1,500 years means that fewer than six out of ten, or 59 per cent, now describe themselves as Christian. A decade ago nearly three quarters, 72 per cent, did so.

The diminishing number of Christians is mirrored by a rapid growth in those who profess no religious affiliation. A quarter of the population, 14.1million, now say they have no religion, nearly double the 7.7million who said the same thing in the 2001 census.

The growth religion in England and 
Wales is Islam, the census returns showed. Over a decade, numbers of 
Muslims have gone up from around 1.5million to 2.7million, and almost 
one in 20 of the population is now a Muslim.

The lowest level of Christian belief 
is in London, where fewer than half the population, 48 per cent, now say
 they are Christian.

Returns showed the most Christian 
district is Knowsley on Merseyside, where more than four out of ten are 
Christian. More than a third of people in the London borough of Tower 
Hamlets are Muslim. Norwich is the most Godless place in Britain with 
42.5 per cent of its population professing no religion.

The Church of England said it was 
pleased a majority of the population remain Christian. Spokesman the Rev
 Arun Arora said: ‘These results confirm that we remain a faithful 
nation.

‘England remains a country where the 
majority of the nation actively identifies the role that faith plays in 
their life. When all faiths are taken together, people of faith account 
for two-thirds of the nation – two in every three people identify 
themselves as having a faith.

‘The fall in those choosing to 
identify themselves as Christians is a challenge. One of the reasons may
 well be fewer people identifying as “cultural Christians” – those who 
have no active involvement with churches and who may previously have 
identified as Christian for cultural or historical reasons.’

Andrew Copson of the British Humanist 
Association said: ‘In spite of a biased question that positively 
encourages religious responses, to see such an increase in the 
non-religious and such a decrease in those reporting themselves as 
Christian is astounding.

‘Of course these figures still 
exaggerate the number of Christians overall – the number of believing, 
practising Christians is much lower than this and the number of those 
leading their lives with no reference to religion much higher.’

Around 177,000 people claim to be Jedi
 – the ‘faith’ made famous in the Star Wars films – though this number 
is down on the 2001 figure by more than a half.

And 6,242 people subscribe to the Heavy Metal religion, set up in 2010 by the Rock music magazine, Metal Hammer.

Other alternative religions included 56,620 Paganists, 39,061 Spiritualists and 2,418 Scientologists.
