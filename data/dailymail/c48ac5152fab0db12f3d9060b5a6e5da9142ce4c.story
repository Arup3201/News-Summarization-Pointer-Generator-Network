A man who legally changed his name to Santa Claus was called to sit on a New York murder trial jury last week, and like a good citizen he showed up.

The Copiague man who once went by Frank Pascuzzi didn’t have to decide if the defendant was naughty or nice, though, because the case was quickly dismissed.

Pascuzzi spends every winter working as St. Nick, but wore a conservative shirt and jeans to the Suffolk County Courthouse and insists it wasn’t his status as Father Christmas that got him out of the civic headache.

Did he take his sleigh? Santa Claus, nee Frank Pascuzzi, was called to serve on the jury of a Long Island murder case last week

‘It wasn’t just because I was Santa Claus I got off — everyone else got off, too,’ Mr. Claus told the New York Post.

That’s not always the case. Sometimes being Kris Kringle pays off.

Last year, Claus was questioned by a police officer after accidentally rear-ending another vehicle with his truck.

But instead of a ticket, the cop just wanted a photo op. 

Not today: Claus was ready to do his civic duty, but the Suffolk County, new York murder case was dismissed

'Am I on the naughty or nice list?': Claus has the driver's license to prove his name and says courthouse employees wanted to know if they'd be getting gifts this year

‘He looked at my license and says, “Are you kidding me?”’  Claus said. “I said, ‘Look, here’s my credit card.”’

They took pictures together along with the fake reindeer Claus keeps in his pickup for these sorts of occasions.

The Long Islander legally changed his name to Santa Claus in February and has the license to prove it, which caused a small commotion at the courthouse.

Always a hit: Claus is always a hit at Christmas time, but he's asked to pose for photos year round

Yuletide: The father of four even has a son who was born on Christmas. It earned him the middle name Yule

‘When I got there, the police were like, “Am I on the naughty or nice list?”’ the 54-year-old told The Post. ‘My reply was, “If you have to ask, you already know.”’

Claus and his wife Betty have four children and one of them was even born on Christmas day, which earned him the middle name Yule.

He is an unabashed Christmas lover.

‘It’s tons of fun!’ he told the Post. ‘Everyone wants to talk to me. Everybody wants to be my friend.’
