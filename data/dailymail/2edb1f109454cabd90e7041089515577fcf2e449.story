Wayne Rooney has defended his actions which saw him pick up a red card and three-match ban for Manchester United.

The striker's credentials as captain of United and the England team were questioned after he kicked out at Stewart Downing.

But Rooney claimed it was not malicious and that he was just trying to stop a West Ham counter-attack and got his timing wrong.

'I was disappointed to receive the red card. I said afterwards everyone in football understands what I was trying to do and I just mis-timed it.

'It wasn't the same as red cards I've got in the past for lashing out. I tried to stop a counter attack and misjudged it.' 

Despite his domestic ban at present, Rooney is just three goals behind Jimmy Greaves in the England scoring charts and eight behind the country's all-time leader Sir Bobby Charlton. 

With San Marino and Estonia to face in the next five days, it could be assumed that the Manchester United striker could take a large step towards surpassing those landmarks, and Rooney admits it is in the back of his mind.

'It's there. There's no denying it,' he said. 'Jimmy Greaves is there and if I can overtake him this week, in the coming weeks, the coming months (then) that would be great.

'It's not something going into the game (I'm) thinking: 'Oh, I've got to beat Jimmy Greaves' record to get close to Bobby Charlton'.

'I'm wanting to do well for the team and if I can score goals then great and the most important thing for us is to perform well and to win the games.' 

England have scored 26 goals in four matches against San Marino and conceded just one, Davide Gualtieri's infamous strike just 8.3 seconds into a World Cup qualifier in Bologna in 1993.

Rooney will be demanding better concentration on Thursday, though the last two meetings in qualifying for this year's World Cup brought crushing England wins, 5-0 and 8-0.

'I am enjoying the role of captain and the responsibility and in terms of results it is going very well,' added Rooney, 'It's always nice to score goals but the most important thing is the performance and winning the game.'

Striker Jimmy Greaves scored 44 goals for England during his international career
