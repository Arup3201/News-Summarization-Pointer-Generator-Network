Two superheroes have been caught on camera racing each other in a high-speed showdown on water. 

In perhaps a preview of what fans can expect from the 2016 blockbuster Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice, the two caped crusaders were filmed trying to one-up each other in a barefoot water ski competition.

The humorous video in fact stars members of the GB Barefoot Team and was created by 19-year-old Tom Wadsworth, of Bad Wolf Editing.

Filmed at Weaver Sailing Club in Frodsham, Cheshire, in October, the talented sportsmen battled windy conditions to perform a series of stunts.

'Glass-like water and zero wind is what is required for a good performance,' Tom tells MailOnline. 'The day that we did the shoot, we got up at six o'clock in the morning and it was pouring with rain and howling a gale.'

Despite the poor weather, the skiers filmed continuously for 'four to five hours' to get the perfect shot.

Caped crusader: The sport involves skiing at speeds of up to 40mph barefoot while performing tricks

The superheroes attempted to outmanoeuvre each other as they show off one-handed, no hands and backwards moves while skiing at speeds of up to 40mph.

GB Barefoot Team was formed in 1971 and its handful of members include three championship winners, Dave Small, Ted Baber, and Adam Chalk (who appears in the film as Superman).

The video has amassed over a thousand views since it was uploaded to YouTube four days ago.

The idea came to Wadsworth ( who confesses to being more of a Batman fan) after he watched Man of Steel. He says: 'I wondered, how could I make someone fly like Superman without a multi-million pound budget?

'This is when I stumbled upon barefoot waterskiing, which was new to me. These two ideas coupled together could make for a really good video and it had never been done before.'

Tom is currently studying Product Design at Loughborough University, and has been working on his Bad Wolf Editing YouTube channel in his spare time for a few years.

His aim is to turn the hobby into a career. 'It's my true passion,' he says. His editing skills have already landed the budding filmmaker several opportunities, like travelling to Iceland to film the Northern Lights, and to Yellowstone National Park to capture wildlife.
