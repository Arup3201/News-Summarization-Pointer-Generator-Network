Thrill-seekers looking for a new way to get their adrenaline pumping may want to head to the Colorado, U.S., where a new ride has trumped all other river swings.

Dangling over a crevice that disappears 1,300 feet below, this new ride then swings at 50-miles-an-hour over the Colorado River, in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

But whether or not customers will get a chance to enjoy the view is unlikely.

Only for the brave: This terrifying ride perched atop a 1,300ft cliff perhaps trumps all other river swings in the worldÂ 

Flying: The pneumatically-pumped swing flings thrill-seekers at 50mph dangling high over the Colorado River

The Giant Canyon swing, positioned high over the Colorado River, at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park, Colorado, was the brainchild of park owner Steve Beckley.

Mr Beckley, 41, admits that despite designing the new ride, he has only ever tried it out for himself on one occasion.

'Funnily enough, even though I came up with the whole idea for the ride, I have only ever ridden it once,' he said.

'We had a different swing on the site for several years, but we wanted something more extreme.

'When it came time to replace it, the Giant Canyon Swing seemed like the perfect fit.

Head for heights: Propelled at 50mph while dangling high above the Colorado River, this ride is sure to get the adrenaline going, for those brave enough to try it

'It's pneumatically powered and much faster, so it's definitely a bigger adrenaline rush.

'And the spot on the edge of Glenwood Canyon makes it even more exciting.'

Steve explained why despite the apparent danger, thrill-seekers still flock to this one-of-a-kind contraption.

'The reaction from the public is definitely mixed,' he said.

'People usually scream when they're riding it, so first-timers hear that as they're walking up to the ride.

'Then when they see the drop off down into the canyon, they're either thrilled or terrified, and sometimes both.

'It's a lot of fun just to watch people ride it, see their faces and hear them scream and laugh.'
