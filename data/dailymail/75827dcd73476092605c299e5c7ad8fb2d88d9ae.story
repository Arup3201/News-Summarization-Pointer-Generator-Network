Stylist who worked on hit show Gossip Girl had been on short flight to see Christmas lights

Model and fashion blogger Lauren Scruggs is beginning to learn the extent of the horrific, life-changing injuries she sustained after walking into a spinning airplane propeller and has even been able to utter a few words since surgery.

The 23-year-old - who sustained graphic wounds to her head and shoulder and underwent emergency surgery to have her hand amputated - is beginning to come to terms with what happened to her as she recovers in ICU surrounded by her family.

A spokeswoman said on the weblog Caring Bridge set up in her honour: 'As Lauren begins to wake up, she is learning the extent of her injuries.'

'Brittany (her twin sister) was able 
to explain to her that she was in an accident, sustaining multiple 
injuries. She seemed to acknowledge what Brittany explained and 
confirmed it with a hand squeeze.

'She is able to open her right eye to
 see while her left eye is still bandaged. Please continue to pray for 
the vision of her left eye, as we will not know the status of her sight 
for some time,' stated the website.

It also revealed that when the doctor asked the 23-year-old what her name was, she was able to say 'Lauren'.

When her sister and mother told her they love her she told them, 'I love you too.'

Miss Scruggs, who created her own style website, was injured as she climbed out of a two-seater plane at Aero County Airport in McKinney, Texas, after a flight to see Christmas lights across the state two days ago.

According to RadarOnline, Lynn 
Lunsford, Mid-States Public Affairs Manager with the Federal Aviation 
Administration,said that an integral part of the investigation into 
exactly what happened is why the propeller was still moving when Scruggs
 got off the plane.

'It appears that the pilot left the 
engine running at idle while she exited the plane to switch places with 
another passenger. That's one of the aspects of the investigation,' she 
told RadarOnline.

The pilot has not yet been identified but he is thought to have been a friend of Lauren's and recently purchased the plane.

The 23-year-old, from the suburban 
area of Plano in Dallas, was taken to the Parkland Memorial Hospital 
where her devout Christian family, including her mother Cheryl, father 
Jeff and twin sister Brittany, gathered at her bedside.

A
 close family friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline: 
'I don't know anyone more gracious and sincere than Lauren. She always 
puts her family and friends first and everyone just flocks to her.

'But if there was someone who could make the best of this situation and come out on top, then she can.'

Family friend Janee Harrell said: 'Speaking for the entire Scruggs family, your prayers are greatly appreciated and felt every moment.

'Many of you know, our beautiful Lauren was in an accident. After exiting a propeller plane, an accident occurred where she walked into the front of the prop.

'Struck on the left side of her body, Lauren's hand, head, and shoulder area were hit.

'Following multiple surgeries, Lauren has received facial and shoulder reconstruction, as well as the loss of her hand.

'We are currently praying for healing on the left eye and brain. She is in a stable condition with ongoing surgery. Keep praying!'

In a later blog post, Ms Harrell wrote that Lauren was 'currently resting peacefully in ICU'.

She added: 'Earlier in the night, there was a victory. With her eyes closed, Jeff [her father] asked Lauren to respond by squeezing his hand, moments later that is exactly what she did! Praise the Lord.

'Tomorrow, Lauren will be heading 
back into surgery so that the doctors can finish up the work on her left
 hand area. Pray that the surgery goes flawlessly, as well as there will
 be no infections.'

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were investigating the incident.

In an email to MailOnline today, an FAA  spokesman wrote: 'According to our preliminary information, the woman was a passenger in a 2011 Aviat Husky. 

'She had just exited the aircraft 
when she walked into the propeller around 9.30 pm on Saturday at Aero 
Country Airport. We are still investigating and will interview the pilot
 and any other witnesses.'

The
 identity of the pilot would not be revealed while the FAA investigation
 was ongoing but he was believed not to have been injured. He is also 
believed to be a family friend.
