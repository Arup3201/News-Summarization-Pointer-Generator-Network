DJ Neil Fox today vowed to clear his name after being arrested over over alleged sex offences against two women.

Speaking outside the £3million home in Chelsea, south-west London, which he shares with his 41-year-old wife Vicky and their three children,  Fox said he had found yesterday ‘stressful’.

The 53-year-old Magic FM breakfast show host - who was bailed last night after questioning at a Metropolitan Police station in central London - insisted he would ‘work hard to clear my name’. 

'I'll work hard to clear my name': Speaking outside the £3million home in Chelsea he shares with his wife Vicky, 41, and their three children, Neil Fox (pictured above) said he had found yesterday 'stressful'

Radio DJ: Neil 'Dr' Fox was arrested at the studios of Magic FM in central London, just moments after he finished presenting his breakfast show yesterday morning. He was then questioned at a police station

Broadcaster: Fox has been married to wife Vicky - pictured together in 2012 (left) and last year (right) - since 1999. He was bailed last night after being questioned over alleged sexual offences

Fox, who wore a black shirt and jeans and appeared to be exhausted, told reporters this morning: ‘Obviously I had a very stressful day yesterday - it was a complete surprise.

‘I haven’t really got much very to say in terms of a statement at the moment. I need to go and speak to my lawyer and see where it all stands and just see where we are.’

The father of three was questioned for more than seven hours over four alleged offences. Three against him are historic and the fourth relates to an incident earlier this year.

He added: ‘I’ve got three young children trying to get on with their school life and you have to respect their privacy in all of this. It’s nothing to do with them, obviously.

On TV: Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol with (from left) Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart

Earlier this month Fox (right) hosted Magic FM's London's Biggest Breakfast which was attended by Mayor Boris Johnson (left), who hosted a breakfast club at the event. He joined the commercial radio station in 2005

‘It’s to do with me and the serious allegations made against me, and obviously what I want to do is work hard to clear my name. As and when I’ve got more to say I will.’

Today, Fox missed his morning show on Magic - which he has presented for nine years. He was arrested at the central London offices of the radio station yesterday just moments after coming off air at 10am.

Officers searched his Chelsea home, as well as a countryside property he owns in West Sussex.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said yesterday: ‘The man was arrested at a business address in W1 and taken to a central London police station.

‘Officers subsequently searched addresses in SW6 and the Littlehampton area of West Sussex. The man has now been bailed to return on a date in early December pending further inquiries.’

Radio star: Fox (left, in 2011), who is known by nicknames 'Dr Fox' and 'Foxy', started his career in local radio. He is also pictured (right) with Pamela Anderson at the National Television Awards in 2002, where Pop Idol won

The probe – the latest in high-profile inquiries into the conduct of ageing celebrities – does not fall under Operation Yewtree, which investigated the Jimmy Savile scandal.

A spokesman for Bauer Media confirmed Fox had been arrested. He said the presenter would be off air from today ‘to enable him to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters’.

The spokesman added: ‘All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. We can make no further comment at this stage.’

Fox rose to fame as a radio DJ in the 1990s, but is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of The X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell , Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman.

The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade.
