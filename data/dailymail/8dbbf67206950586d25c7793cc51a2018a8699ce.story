Technology that eavesdrops on tweets could warn you of how likely it is to become ill by visiting a restaurant. 

The system, dubbed ‘nEmesis’, combines machine-learning and crowdsourcing techniques to analyse millions of tweets posted by people after visiting restaurants. 

It then ranks restaurants according to how likely it is for someone to get food poisoning after eating there.

In just four months, the system collected 3.8 million tweets from more than 94,000 unique users in New York City, traced 23,000 restaurant visitors, and found 480 reports of likely food poisoning.

According to scientists at the University of Rochester in New York, the technology could also be used  by 
authorities to better monitor food safety, by providing more timely 
restaurant inspections.

‘The Twitter reports are not an exact indicator – any individual case could well be due to factors unrelated to the restaurant meal – but in aggregate the numbers are revealing,’ said Henry Kautz, chair of the computer science department.

If a user tweets from a location that is determined to be a restaurant, the system will continue to track this person's tweets for 72 hours, even when they're not geotagged, or when they are using a different device

The Food Standards Agency has estimated that each year in the UK:

Around a million people suffer a foodborne illness

Around 20,000 people receive hospital treatment due to food poisoning

There are around 500 deaths because of it

It costs nearly £1.5 billion

The FSA claims that each one per cent 
reduction in case numbers would mean around 10,000 fewer cases and would
 save the economy around £15 million each year.

A seemingly random collection of online rants becomes an actionable alert, according to Kautz, which can rapidly help detect cases of food-borne illness.

nEmesis 'listens' to relevant public tweets and detects restaurant visits by matching up where a person tweets from and the known locations of restaurants. 

People will often tweet from their phones or other mobile devices, which are GPS enabled, which means the system knows a person's exact location.

If a user tweets from a location that is determined to be a restaurant, the system will continue to track this person's tweets for 72 hours, even when they're not geotagged, or when they are tweeted from a different device.

If a user then tweets about feeling ill, the system captures the information along with the specific restaurant visited.

According to the researchers, around one third of the inspection scores could be reliably predicted from the Twitter data.

The remainder of the scores show some disagreement. ‘This disagreement is interesting as the public inspection data is not perfect either, ‘argued co-author Adam Sadilek, formerly a colleague of Kautz at Rochester and who is now at Google.

‘The adaptive inspections could reveal the real risk, which is currently hidden for both methods.’

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) estimates that in the UK there are over a million cases of food poisoning each year, 20,000 hospitalisations and 500 deaths.

Foods that are most frequently associated with foodborne illness include meat, fish andpoultry.

The FSA claims that each one per cent reduction in case numbers would mean around 10,000 fewer cases and would save the economy around £15 million per year.

Overall food poisoning costs the UK economy £1.5 billion each year.
