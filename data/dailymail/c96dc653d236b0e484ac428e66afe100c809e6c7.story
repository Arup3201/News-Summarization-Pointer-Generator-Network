Geography clearly isn’t his strong point but Jermain Defoe proved he still knows the route to goal.

Having announced himself delighted to be in the USA when unveiled by Toronto FC last January, the 32-year-old was at it again — this time admitting he was stumped when asked to name the capital city of the country where he spent the best part of 12 months before his lucrative return to the Premier League.

His failure to identify Ottawa in a match programme general knowledge quiz was one of the rare occasions the Sunderland forward put a foot wrong.

Burnley are closing in on Birmingham City’s five-year-old Premier League record of 12 successive unchanged line-ups after Sean Dyche sent out the same starting XI for the ninth consecutive game.

On the pitch, where it matters most, he underlined just how well he can navigate his way into the danger areas of the opponents’ penalty box.

Sunderland were already a goal to the good through Connor Wickham’s early header when Defoe engineered space to convert Patrick van Aanholt’s cross as Gus Poyet’s side earned only a second home league win of the season.

Having been a regular scorer on debut for his previous clubs, Defoe had to wait until his third game with his latest club to open his account.

‘As a forward you’re just waiting to get that first goal,’ he said.

‘We created plenty of chances and I felt a lot sharper because of the games I’ve now played.’
