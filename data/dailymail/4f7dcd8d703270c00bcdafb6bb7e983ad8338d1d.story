With dust billowing into the sky, this is the moment a hillside crumbled to the ground at a busy construction site in Ecuador killing two workers and injuring eight more. 

The hillside collapsed after an earthquake triggered a landslide at a quarry site in Ecuador, seven miles north of the capital of Quito. 

It killed two employees of a Chinese contractor that works for the city. Eight more were injured. 

A further three people are still missing from the quarry after the landslide in the Catequilla area of the country, near the Equator.

Parts of Quito were covered in clouds of dust that formed from moving earth at the nearby quarry, and the capital's Tababela airport was temporarily suspended.  

Another landslide engulfed a vehicle on a road north of the city, but the driver escaped unharmed, rescue workers said.  

The 5.1 magnitude quake struck the Ecuadorian province of Pinchincha on Tuesday, causing buildings to sway and sent people running into the streets. 

In total, four people have been killed and eight others injured.
