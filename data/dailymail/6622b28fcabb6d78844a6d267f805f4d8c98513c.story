Michael
 Gannons was at the end of his tether. For three years he had suffered 
from painful swelling in his left leg, which started at the top of his 
thigh but spread right down to his ankle and then, in January this year,
 to his groin and abdomen.

Michael has lymphoedema, a chronic 
disorder that occurs when the lymph system - a network of tiny vessels 
that drains fluid, or lymph, from the tissue and back into the 
bloodstream - doesn't function properly. This leads to a build-up of 
fluid, causing swelling, pain, loss of mobility and increased risk of 
infection.

Then Michael learnt about an unlikely remedy - Kinesio 
tape. This is the brightly coloured tape athletes, such as Real Madrid 
footballer Gareth Bale, use to help prevent muscle injury, but it is 
increasingly being used by specialists caring for people with 
lymphoedema. After three weeks of treatment, Michael's swelling has been
 dramatically reduced.

Around 200,000 Britons are thought to suffer 
from the condition. It occurs either as a result of an abnormality from 
birth - 'primary' lymphoedema - or, more typically, when the lymph 
system is damaged or blocked as a result of surgery, injury, obesity or 
cancer treatment.

In cancer patients it usually affects the arms and
 legs, as the lymph nodes - small glands connected to the lymph vessels 
that collect bacteria and other harmful substances in the lymph fluid - 
are commonly removed to stop the disease spreading.

Michael developed
 lymphoedema in 2010 after surgery to remove a few cancerous lymph nodes
 in his groin. Two years previously he'd had a malignant mole removed 
from his left calf and it was thought that cancer cells had travelled up
 his leg.

'After the operation the top of my left leg blew up like a 
balloon,' says the 63-year-old biomedical scientist, who lives with his 
wife Ruth, 66, in Luton, Bedfordshire. 'I found it hard to walk and 
couldn't drive.'

Every day for five months he had to go to hospital to have a litre of fluid drained from his leg.When
 the swelling eventually subsided, Michael says: 'I jumped into my car 
and drove to  Scotland to see a friend - I was finally free.'

But a 
few weeks later the lymphoedema returned, now affecting his whole leg. 
He was referred to a lymphoedema clinic at his local hospital, where he 
was given compression stockings, bandages and manual lymphatic drainage -
 massage to encourage lymph fluid to leave the swollen area.But he 
found these had a limited effect and the compression garments and 
bandages could be uncomfortable. Then, early last year, CT scans 
revealed new tumours in his groin.

After three weeks of treatment, Michael's swelling has been dramatically reduced

Because these were blocking lymph nodes, fluid gradually built up in his abdomen and scrotum and worsened in his upper leg.

Finally, fed up with the wait at the clinic, in January he went private and was offered Kinesio taping.Kinesio
 tape is essentially elastic cotton tape with a medical adhesive on the 
back. For athletes, applying it over injured muscles is thought to stop 
them overstretching and returns the muscle to a neutral position, 
relaxing it and preventing further injury. With lymphoedema, applying it
 to stretched skin 'lifts' the skin, reducing pressure on the lymphatic 
system underneath - this  encourages lymph fluid to drain, explains Jane
 Wigg, a lymphoedema specialist nurse based in Dudley. This is different
 from compression garments, which encourage fluid into the lymphatic 
system by applying compression (or pressure).

A Chinese study, 
published in 2009, showed that Kinesio taping worked as well in women 
with breast cancer-related lymphoedema as bandages, and was easier to 
use and more comfortable.'Kinesio taping is particularly helpful in 
problem areas such as the top of the arm or leg, or the breast, where 
compression garments don't cover or cannot be fitted easily,' says Jane 
Wigg.

'Lots of my patients swear by Kinesio taping,' says Anne 
Dancey, a consultant plastic surgeon  with a special interest in 
lymphoedema at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and BMI The Priory, both in
 Birmingham.

Michael underwent three weeks of intense treatment 
where Kinesio tape was applied to his thigh, reaching up to above his 
belly button and over his groin. It was removed and replaced every two 
days - 'I barely felt it,' he says.

At the end of the treatment his 
leg was 8in smaller in circumference - 'it had contained a stone of 
fluid and that's gone, so it looks the same as my other leg and there is
 no fluid in my abdomen or scrotum,' says Michael.

'Now I can do all the things I couldn't before, such as driving, running and playing football - I can live a normal life.'

He
 still uses compression stockings to encourage fluid to move to working 
lymph nodes, but these only reach his thigh, so he uses them in 
conjunction with Kinesio taping in other areas. Thanks to the tape, he 
no longer needs constrictive bandages.  But while Kay Eaton, a 
consultant nurse in cancer and supportive care, who runs the lymphoedema
 service at University College London Hospitals, agrees that Kinesio 
taping may help, she says patients must be fully assessed before 
treatment.

For a lot of people Kinesio taping can help to control 
lymphoedema but it isn't a standalone treatment, adds Karen Friett, 
chief executive of the Lymphoedema Support Network charity.

It must 
be done by a skilled therapist, says Jane Wigg: 'They need to know where
 the fluid is draining to and be able to follow the lymphatic pathways.'

There
 are also surgical treatments for lymphoedema. Liposuction can help by 
removing the fatty deposits that build up with the fluid over time as a 
result of accumulation of proteins and other changes to the tissue. This
 fat can't be pushed away with massage or bandaging.

The lymphoedema returned, now affecting his whole leg

However, while 
liposuction can help if compression stockings are put on straight after 
the fat is removed, it doesn't correct the problem in the lymph system.

For
 severe cases Anne Dancey offers lymph node transfer, where healthy 
nodes are removed and transplanted to the problem area, though this is 
not yet approved by the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE).

Ms Dancey's concern is the 'postcode lottery' 
across the UK for access to treatment: 'Many people are forced to spend 
thousands to go private - some of my patients even go to France. 
Services are very overstretched.

'It's seen as only a complication of
 surgery. And there's an attitude that cancer patients shouldn't moan 
because their life has been saved by treatment that has given them 
lymphoedema, when it's a completely debilitating condition. People get 
infections constantly, can't work, can't wear clothes they want and it 
affects self-esteem.'

Lymphoedema is 'under-recognised and complex', 
agrees Kay Eaton. 'If it's diagnosed early, treatment can be very 
effective but this is often not the case.'

Furthermore, the 
Lymphoedema Support Network says those with non-cancer-related 
lymphoedema - at least half of all patients - find it harder to get 
treatment because the NICE guidelines only cover cancer patients, 
particularly those with breast cancer (one in five develop lymphoedema).

Michael
 Gannons considers himself lucky to have been able to afford private 
treatment. He is delighted with Kinesio taping and now plans to go on 
holiday. He says: 'I'm going to enjoy wearing shorts this summer.'
