One of the Charlie Hebdo terrorists had links to the 'underwear bomber' who tried to blow up a commercial US flight on Christmas Day, it has been claimed. 

The revelation comes as French investigators try to establish the connections the suspects had with terror networks and one another. 

Two brothers who killed 12 in an attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine on Wednesday were shot dead yesterday as they fled a warehouse north of Paris, firing at police.

Shortly afterwards in eastern Paris, anti-terrorist forces stormed a kosher supermarket where hostages were being held by a gunman with reported links to the brothers. The gunman and four hostages died.

According to reports, Said Kouachi shared a flat with 'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (right)

A Yemeni journalist and researcher, Mohammed al-Kibsi, told CNN he had met and spoken with one of the brothers - Said Kouachi - in Yemen in 2011 and 2012.

He said Kouachi - who was studying Arabic grammar - shared a small apartment with the 'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab for one to two weeks in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. 

Abdulmutallab, a native Nigerian, was sentenced to life in prison in February 2012 for trying to bomb a US passenger plane flying from Amsterdam to Detroit as a would-be suicide mission for al-Qaeda. 

He was badly burned when a bomb sewn into his underwear failed to detonate fully in the plane carrying nearly 300 people.

During his trial, Abdulmutallab said the bomb in his underwear was a 'blessed weapon' to avenge poorly treated Muslims around the world.

Mr al-Kibsi told CNN Abdulmutallab and Kouachi also prayed together at the Al-Tabari School while they were staying together. As yet, his claims have not been given official confirmation. 

Elsewhere Cherif Kouachi (pictured) named al-Qaeda's Yemen branch as his commanders

It came as Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch, known as AQAP, released a statement saying they directed the attack to make good on previous threats. 

One of the brothers - Cherif Kouachi - named the terror group's Yemen branch as his commanders.  

A statement released in English said: 'The leadership of #AQAP directed the operation, and they have chosen their target carefully as a revenge for the honor of Prophet (pbuh) [peace be upon him].

'The target was in France in particular because of its obvious role in the war on Islam and oppressed nations.

'The operation was the result of the threat of Sheikh Usama (RA). He warned the West about the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslims' sanctities.

'Sheikh Usama (RA) said in his message to the West: If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions.

'The Organization delayed to claim responsibility due to the executors' security reasons.'  

In a chilling telephone conversation with a journalist - later played out on French news network BFM - Kouachi said he knew he was talking to a reporter before saying: 'I am a defender of the prophet.

'I was sent by Al Qaeda of Yemen. I'm financed by Imam anwar al Awlaqi - Anwar is a predicateur (preacher). He has lived in the Yemen. He is one of the thinking heads of Al Qaeda.'

A BFMTV studio journalist then reports how Kouachi speaks in a calm and determined manner during the recorded interview - almost as if he had prepared for it - explaining that he denied he had killed civilians.

She said Kouachi did not consider journalists at Charlie Hebdo as civilians but targets.

He said that he wasn't interested in killing women and children, but Westerners who kill children in Iraq, Syriah and Afghanistan.

Amedy Coulibaly, who together with his girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene held terrified shoppers captives in a kosher supermarket in Paris, told a journalist his actions were carried out to defend Muslims

In a separate interview, also played out on BFM, Amedy Coulibaly, who together with his girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene held terrified shoppers captive in a kosher supermarket in Paris, told a journalist his actions were carried out to defend Muslims in Palestine and to target Jews.  

The reporter said that he claimed to have been acting under instructions from the Islamic State and that his actions were synchronised by the Kouachi brothers.

He is asked: 'Are you in contact with the two (Kouachi) brothers,' to which he answered: 'Yes we made contact before the operations.'

He then denied having been in contact with them recently and said he did not plan to take any further action.

In the end, the studio journalist described the gunman's claim that the kosher supermarket had been targeted because it was popular with Jews and that he carried out the siege 'to defend Muslims... notably in Palestine.'

It is not yet clear when exactly the interviews were carried out but they are believed to have taken place hours before they were killed.

Dozens of commandos stormed a Jewish grocery 25 miles away in east Paris where accomplice Coulibaly was threatening to kill 15 terrified captives, including women and children

Four hostages were killed  following the dramatic end to the siege at the kosher market in the east of Paris

Koachi and his brother Said were killed after special forces brought an end to more than two days of slaughter which have left at least 17 dead and spread terror across France.

The brothers died in a blaze of gunfire at a printworks near Paris where they had been holed up with one hostage, who survived.

Moments later, dozens of commandos stormed a Jewish grocery 25 miles away in east Paris where accomplice Coulibaly was holding captives, including women and children. 

The gunman and four hostages died. It is believed they were killed before the police assault on Hypercasher supermarket, near Porte de Vincennes.

Witnesses watched in horror as freed hostages fled the scene screaming, some carrying their children in their arms. 

'It's war!' screamed a mother as she dragged her daughter from the scene.
