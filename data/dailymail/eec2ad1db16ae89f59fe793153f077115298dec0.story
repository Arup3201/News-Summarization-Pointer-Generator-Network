A vicar who went on a rowing pilgrimage from Dorset to Cornwall and back is believed to have drowned after he was found dead on a beach near his wrecked boat.

The body of Reverend Bob Thorn, 59, was washed up on a beach near Seatown, just five miles from his parish of Burton Bradstock, Dorset, on Monday, shortly after his damaged rowing boat was found nearby.

The popular clergyman was on a three-month sabbatical when he rowed a 10ft wooden boat from his home in Dorset to Cornwall last month on a religious pilgrimage.

Popular Dorset vicar, the Reverend Bob Thorne, 59, is believed to have drowned while rowing home from Cornwall

He is believed to have been rowing the 150 miles back to his parish along the south coast when he got into trouble.

Police and coastguards searched a 50-mile stretch of coastline from West Bay in Dorset to Teignmouth in Devon after the empty and damaged timber boat was washed ashore.

After several hours of searching, the vicar's body was found in a small cove a few hundred feet along the beach from where his boat was discovered.

Officers say they are not treating the death of Mr Thorn, who was married to Jean, also a priest, and had four children, as suspicious.  A post-mortem has yet to be carried out.

Mr Thorn, rector of the Bride Valley Benefice, which covers eight churches, was a keen rower who undertook long spiritual voyages, a tradition started by Celtic Christian monks in the sixth and seventh centuries.

Before he left the clergyman had asked his parishioners to pray for his safe return in a parish newsletter, saying: 'When I say, please pray for me, I 
have to say that I would love sunny skies and warm, helping breezes, but
 they are not for you to ask.

The married father of four was the vicar of Burton Bradstock, Dorset, and well-known in the community

'They
 will be as they are. But I do ask your prayers, please, for the 
fortitude of God being with me, to be strong and of a good courage.'

The
 vicar, a talented folk singer who fought back after a life-threatening 
stroke some years ago, left Burton Bradstock in February and rowed west 
to the remote Pendower Beach near Falmouth in Cornwall, where he 
intended to spend Lent 'living off the land and sea and being at one 
with God'.

He undertook the journey in small stages, pulling into small coves and beaches, some of them only accessible by sea, overnight.

A spokesman for the Diocese of 
Salisbury, which includes Burton Bradstock, said: 'Bob was a larger than
 life character and rowing was something that was extremely important to
 him - he was big into it.

'He was really into Celtic spirituality, and very much into rowing off to places, praying, and rowing back again.'

The vicar was a talented folk singer, songwriter and guitarist who fought back after a life-threatening stroke

The popular vicar was found on a beach not far from his home on Monday, hours after his boat was found

The
 Right Reverend Nicholas Holtam, Bishop of Salisbury, said he was 
'devastated' to learn of the death of 'a remarkable man of incredible 
determination'.

And the 
Reverend Andrew Evans, rector of Bridport, said: 'Bob died doing 
something that he passionately wanted to do, but of course the outcome 
of it has been such a tragedy both for him and for Burton Bradstock.'

Chief Inspector Dean O’Connor, from Dorset police, said: 'The next of kin have been updated, and there are no suspicious circumstances relating to the death.'

Mr Thorn was an active member of the Bristol folk scene in the 1970s and recorded two albums called 2nd Best Guitar and The Shortest River in Dorset.

Adrian Collis, his manager and friend, said: 'He was a very good songwriter, and part of his thinking of going on his latest pilgrimage was that he would write songs about it on his return, and share his experiences with people through his music.

'Sadly he will never get the chance to do that.'

The clergyman had previously been on walking pilgrimages to the Holy island of Lindisfarne in Northumberland and to Canterbury, and last year published a book about his Lindisfarne trip.
