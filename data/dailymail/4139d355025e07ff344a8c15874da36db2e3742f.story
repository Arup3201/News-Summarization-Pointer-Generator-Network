He's back: BBC series Bergerac, starring John Nettles could be brought back, but Mr Nettles is very unlikely to return

The BBC could remake classic Jersey-based crime drama Bergerac, but its original star John Nettles is unlikely to be playing the role that made him so famous, it emerged today.

It is more than 20 years since the original ratings hit was axed but the Corporation says a new version is in development, but with a younger Jim Bergerac.

BBC bosses are eager to copy the success of ITV's Endeavour, which follows the career of the young Inspector Morse.

A spokesman told MailOnline the new show is in development, but has not yet been commissioned.

Insiders say it wants to make the drama more appealing to a younger audience rather than the more middle-aged market who watched it decades ago

The original Bergerac starred John Nettles as the title character, a casually dressed detective with a vintage sports car solving crimes against the sunny backdrop of the Channel Islands.

It ran for a decade on the BBC from 1981 to 1991. After it ended, Nettles went on to star in the highly successful Midsomer Murder series on ITV.

It is developing what the makers call a 'reboot' of Bergerac with BBC's in house drama team and with the blessing of the original series creator Robert Banks Stewart.

He told industry journal Broadcast: 'The team involved has full artistic freedom to recreate Bergerac the way they see it in the 21st century.

'Obviously the unique atmosphere of Jersey and the island's involvement will count for a lot.'

After losing out to ITV successes like Downton Abbey and Mr Selfridge in recent drama ratings battles, the show could help revive the BBC's fortunes.

And it may also restore some of Jersey's reputation beyond that of a tax-dodging haven for celebrities like Jimmy Carr who had a reported Â£3.3 million stashed in an account there.
