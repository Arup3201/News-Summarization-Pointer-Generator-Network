Victor Paul Alvarez was fired from Boston.com for the story he wrote that has been dubbed 'tasteless, mean-spirited and humorless in one fell swoop'

A reporter  has been fired after penning a tasteless story about a death threat made against Speaker John Boehner.

Victor Paul Alvarez, an associate editor at Boston.com, wrote a story on Tuesday night headlined: 'Would anyone have noticed if bartender succeeded in poisoning John Boehner?'

The article suggested that House Speaker Boehner has a drinking problem, and then claimed that his ‘pickled liver’ could have ‘filtered out the toxins’ from an attempt to poison him.

A former bartender at an Ohio country club is currently charged with threatening to kill Boehner with a gun or by poisoning his drink.

Alvarez said in an email to the Associated Press that he was fired on Thursday. He also said he apologized to his bosses for the ‘terrible mistake’.

On Twitter, Alvarez’s bio now reads: ‘My last boss said - It’s very difficult to hit the epicenter of tasteless, mean-spirited and humorless in one fell swoop - He's right. I'm to blame. No excuse.’

That quote reportedly comes from Mike Sheehan, chief executive of Boston.com's owner, Boston Globe Media Partners.

Sheehan sent an apology to Boehner's office.

Alvarez also took time to answer critics on Twitter and make a statement that read: 'Ordered silent yesterday. Now I can comment: The story I wrote was awful. Tasteless. Mean. Bosses felt it was inexcusable. They fired me.' 

Boston.com general manager Corey Gottlieb said it was posted without a top editor's review. Gottlieb said the site doesn't comment on personnel matters.

The article has been rewritten under the headline 'Bartender’s Threat Against John Boehner Thwarted' and now includes an apology from Gottlieb and an Editor’s note.

A day after he was fired, Alvarez responded to some of his critics on Twitter and made a short statement accepting responsibility for the 'tasteless' and 'mean' story

The apology reads:

'Last night, an opinion piece was published on Boston.com that has since been adjusted to what you’ll see below. The original column made references to Speaker Boehner that were off-color and completely inappropriate. It reflected the opinions of one of our writers; what it did not reflect, by any standards, were the site’s collective values. Rather than remove any reference to it or pretend it didn’t happen, we are handling with transparency and self-awareness. We are sorry, and we will do better.'

The Editor’s note states: ‘A previous version of this article made an unsubstantiated reference to the health of Speaker Boehner.’

The Boston Globe coverage of the story says that while Boston.com is owned by Boston Globe Media Partners LLC, it operates independently from The Boston Globe and BostonGlobe.com, with separate editorial leadership.

A Boehner spokesman called Alvarez's story ‘insensitive and inappropriate’.

Speaker Boehner was threatened by Michael Hoyt, a former bartender at the Wetherington Country Club in Ohio (pictured) that is patronized by Boehner. Hoyt was fired in October and believed the congressman was to blame

The threat to Speaker Boehner that was the subject of the original article came from 44-year-old Michael Hoyt, a former bartender at the Wetherington Country Club patronized by Boehner.

Hoyt has been charged with threatening to murder the 12-term congressman by poisoning his wine.

According to federal prosecutors, the failed assassination plot was hatched after Hoyt was fired from the club. Which he believed was the fault of Speaker Boehner.

When questioned by the authorities, Hoyt reportedly said evil voices coming from his car speakers and his radio at home told him the House speaker was the devil.

In his rantings to police, Hoyt allegedly blamed the Ohio Republican for spreading Ebola and said he had been planning to shoot Boehner with his Beretta .380 automatic.

The alleged plot on the politician’s life came to light October 29 when Mr Hoyt called 911 to complain that John Boehner allegedly got him fired a week earlier.

When officers responded to Hoyt's home, the bartender told them he regretted he 'did not have time to put something in John Boehner's drink' during the five years he had spent serving him wine at the country club.

Hoyt claimed that he was Jesus Christ and that Boehner had been mean to him and was responsible for Ebola. He also wrote a rambling email to Boehner’s wife Debbie about his firing from the country club, and was convinced that evil people were coming to 'chop him up' – a fear that prompted him to call the police.

Hoyt volunteered to be taken to a psychiatric hospital, and his loaded weapon was confiscated.

Hoyt's arrest comes less than a year after two other men were charged with threatening John Boehner’s life.

Brandon Thompson, 32, of Indiana, was arrested May 9 for making threats against Speaker Boehner, just days before Ronald Frazier, of Arizona, tweeted about wanting to kill the Republican politician.
