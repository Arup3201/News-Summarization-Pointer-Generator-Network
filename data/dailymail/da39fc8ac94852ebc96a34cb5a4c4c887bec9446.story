The BBC today faced being pulled into another racism row after a football expert at Euro 2012 made a 'casually racist' remark about a fan dressed in a head-to-toe black morph body suit.

Expert pundit Mark Lawrenson had been commentating on Germany's match against Portugal on Saturday evening when BBC cameras panned to a fan dressed completely in a tight black suit.

As the fan appeared on screen, veteran pundit Lawrenson joked that the black-costumed spectator looked like Eric 'the Eel' Moussambani, a black swimmer who shot to fame at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

The 'crass' remark was quickly pounced on by dozens of football fans watching the coverage, who took to Twitter to express their amazement that the 55-year-old co-commentator had made such a comment.  

Lawrenson had joked: 'That Eric the Eel, isn't it, sitting at the front?' as the fan appeared on screen, before BBC cameras cut back to the action.

One user posted soon after the comment: 'The "eric the eel" comment was particularly crass, even by his usual inane standards.'

Ill-judged: Lawrenson claimed the remark was a reference to the lycra suits Eric the Eel himself used to wear, but many Twitter users took the comment differently

Another poster on Twitter said: 'I still can’t get over Lawro’s ‘Eric The Eel’ comment. After all this talk of racism in Ukraine.'

Minutes later another user of the micro blogging site said: 'Just checking, but did (Mark) lawrenson did just throw in some casual racism about a guy in a black lycra suit, calling him eric the eel?'

The BBC today insisted the comment was 'in no way meant to be offensive', as Lawrenson had been making reference to occasions when Moussambani had also swam wearing a lycra suit.

But many Twitter users saw the remark differently, with one even calling for Lawrenson to be 'taken off the TV'.

The ill-judged remarks also came just months after Lawrenson's Match of the Day colleague Alan Hansen was forced to apologise for using the word 'coloured'.

In a discussion of the controversies surrounding England captain John Terry and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, Hansen used the word as he praised the achievements of black players in the Premier League.

But many viewers objected to the term – considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same – and the Corporation received more than 100 complaints over the incident.

'Eric the Eel' became an overnight sensation at Sydney 2000 when he slowly made his way through a 100 metres freestyle heat.

Having never swum competitively in a 50-metre pool, Moussambani flagged near the end of his solo heat and appeared to almost sink as he approached the finish.    

His finishing time of 1:52.72, was the slowest seen at an Olympics and more than a minute behind the world record. But he received a standing ovation and instant fame as reporters dubbed him ‘Eric the Eel’.

A BBC spokesperson commenting on Lawrenson's remark said: 'Mark Lawrenson commented on a man dressed in an all in one swimsuit which was similar to those worn by Eric the Eel. This was clearly not meant to cause offence.'
