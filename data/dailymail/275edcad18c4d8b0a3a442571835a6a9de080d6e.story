Saturn, around of 900 million miles from Earth, is the second largest planet in our solar system.

Orbitting it are 62 moons and, since its arrival in 2004, Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which has been sending back images and data on some of them, and the planet itself.

And now, in a series of enhanced images from the spacecraft, the detail and beauty that was previously hidden in some of the photos has been revealed.

Croatian programmer Gordon Ugarkovic  added colour and touched up the snaps to reveal new details. In the images the gas giant Saturn and its moons are featured. Here is Titan (background) and Rhea, with the former 2.038 million km from Cassini and the latter 1.329 million km

The amazing new photos were created by Croatian computer programmer Gordan Ugarkovic.

He highlights a stunning array of features on the gas giant and its moons including Titan and Dione.

The latter, for example, can be seen with pockmarked craters across its surface.

In another image, it is seen dwarfed by the much larger Titan, as Cassini made a rare pass that saw the two align.

The hazy atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan is also revealed in stunning detail, with a noticeable ‘thin blue line’ between where the atmosphere ends and space begins.

And Saturn is also given some additional treatment, with the huge planet and its rings seen partially lit up by the sun.

Writing on his Flickr page, Mr Ugarkovic said he created the images because he was ‘somewhat underwhelmed by the frequency the Cassini Imaging Team releases colour composites.'

The majestic Saturn is seen here with part of the planet lit up, while the rings of dust can also be seen encircling the planet. Titan can also be seen above the planet in the top right. The faint greenish colour to the left of the planet is residual camera glare that could not be removed

Here the surface of Enceladus can be seen in exquisite detail, with the sun also lighting up part of the moon. It's thought it may have an ocean of water underneath its surface

Dione is seen in front of Titan. The distance to Titan in the image is 3.163 million km, and the distance to Dione is 1.611 million km

He continued: ‘The images you see here are (more or less) calibrated images that were released to the Planetary Data System.

The downside of the PDS is the data releases are delayed about nine months in order to give the imaging team priority over analysing data.

‘Other than that, the PDS data allow more accurate reconstruction of colours and brightnesses over the histogram-stretched jpeg images.’ 

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest in the Solar System after Jupiter.

The planet was named after the Roman god who also lends his name to Saturday.

The gas giant has an average radius about nine times that of Earth.

While just one-eighth the average density of Earth, its larger volume means Saturn is more than 95 times bigger than Earth.

The planet's interior is thought to be composed of a core of iron, nickel and rock surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer gaseous layer.

The planet exhibits a pale yellow hue as a result of the ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.

Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,100mph - faster than those on Jupiter but slower than on Neptune.

The prominent ring system feature nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs.

They are composed mainly of ice particles with a small amount of rocky debris and dust.

There are 62 known moons - 53 of which are officially named - orbiting the planet.

Titan is Saturn's largest and the Solar System's second largest moon - bigger even than Mercury. 

The small irregular moon Epimetheus is seen here from a distance of 104,500km. The moon has a radius of about 130km, while several craters on its surface are larger than 30km

The atmosphere of Titan is seen here, which is often said to be the most Earth-like place in the solar system aside from our planet. The moon is also known to have liquids on its surface in lakes and seas

In recent months Cassini has revealed some fascinating insights into the Saturnian system.

Towards the end of November, Nasa announced that the spacecraft had created the most detailed maps yet of several of Saturn’s moons.

These included the icy surface of Enceladus, which may have a liquid ocean underground, and the bizarre ‘tow-toned’ world of Iapetus.

Cassini also spotted the glint of the sun on the surface of one of Titan’s lakes - confirming the presence of liquids on its surface.

And data released today suggests that there are sand tunes on Titan that may have been shaped by the moon’s wind.

Cassini mission around Saturn will continue until 2017, when it will be sent crashing into gas giant’s atmosphere to prevent it contaminating any of the nearby moons as its fuel runs out.
