Christian Benteke will make his return to match football on Monday afternoon by appearing for Aston Villa Under 21s after almost six months out with a ruptured achilles.

The Belgium striker has been in training for three weeks and manager Paul Lambert is eager to witness the 23-year-old in action when Bolton visit Bodymoor Heath for the 1pm kick-off.

Lambert is hopeful Benteke comes through this test and can be included in the Villa squad for the Premier League match against Manchester City on Saturday.

'He's getting closer,' Lambert said before the Chelsea match. 'Next week we will see how he is for the Man City game. I'm not saying he'll start, or anything, but he's certainly getting close.

'The injury is totally fine, I'm not worried about that. He's taken a couple little kicks in training and has come through them. He's an athlete.

'It's just his lack of practice. You've got to watch he doesn't break down after too much too soon.

'Everybody is happy to see him come back. It's been a long road for him after missing the World Cup. Him coming back has been great. It will give everyone a lift when he comes back, supporters included.’
