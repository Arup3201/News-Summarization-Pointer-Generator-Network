A group of teenagers who allegedly broke into a Los Angeles mansion to host a party that caused more than $1 million in damage have been charged.

The teenagers, aged between 15 and 18, are accused of breaking into the luxury La Habra Heights house while the owner, Nick Radoi, was away in November last year.

More than 100 teenagers turned up for the party at the $7 million mansion, after it was advertized on social media sites including Twitter. 

Loot: A $250,000 stuffed snow leopard and armor were among items recovered after the party

Party: Charges have been brought against 14 teenage revelers accused of breaking into this Los Angeles mansion

The party started in the yard but the house was later broken into a number of valuable items, including medieval armor, designer suits and a stuffed snow leopard valued at $250,000, were taken.

The 12 boys and two girls who are facing charges related to the party and damage have not been named.

According to investigators, revelers broke in through a window and caused about $1 million of damage inside the 90,000sq ft property.

Furniture was broken and dozens of luxury items were taken, though police said much of it was later recovered.

'This is one of the most serious juvenile and adult crimes that we have come across,' Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said when the teenagers were first arrested in December last year.

At the time of the party the house-owner, who made his fortune through a trucking company, was in Europe.

The house was also being offered for sale at the time of the party and subsequent vandalism.

Neighbors had reported seeing cars parked on the road leading up to the property, and heard noise but because the homeowner often held parties himself, they thought little of it.

The teenagers suspected of causing the damage were caught after allegedly posting pictures online of them damaging the house and posing with the stolen goods.

Detectives said they also found pictures allegedly showing teenagers damaging a 16ft window overlooking the pool, which was one of the most valuable features in the house,

'There's like an underground grotto, which had like a 16ft window looking into the pool. Somebody actually broke that window and shattered it, and we're amazed that no kid got killed,' Captain Timothy Murakami, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, told ABC 7 shortly after the party.

Luxury: Designer suits, above, and other items were wrecked or taken during the party, police say

Lieutenant Arthur Scott told KTLA last year: 'They just had a free-for-all once the place was broken into. Once entry was made, it was like, "Oh, this is fun".'

Each of the 14 teenagers face one count of misdemeanor trespassing, and nine face one count of felony burglary, which has a maximum six-year prison sentence.

Other charges include theft and receiving stolen property.

The teenagers, who live in and around La Habra-Whittier are due to appear at juvenile court on Wednesday.
