Cop caught out: Policeman Victor Valenzuela was fired for having sex with a married woman while on duty

An policeman has been fired for having sex with a married woman while on duty and in uniform.

Policeman Victor Valenzuela lost his job in March after internal investigators revealed he had sex with the woman, driving to her house in his patrol car  in Maricopa, Arizona.

Mr Valenzuela admitted to the indiscretion, telling police investigators he had signed up for a 12 step program for sex addicts following the affair, a one-time misdemeanour lasting just 30 minutes.

Perry Edwards, the husband of the woman Mr Valenzuela had sex with, became suspicious of his wife after he found sexual text messages to the police officer on her phone.

Mr Edwards told 3TV that: ‘I don't think any officer should be able to stay on the force if they've been caught having an affair with somebody else's wife while they're on duty.’

Mr Edward’s sister, Roberta Schneider was equally disgusted.

She said: ‘He is supposed to be serving our community, not making booty calls in the back of his car.’

On duty: The disgraced cop drove to the woman's house in his patrol car and in uniform for the one-off 30 minute encounter which cost him his job

Maricopa police chief Steve Stahl said: ‘He showed remorse, he was embarrassed and he wishes to go on with life and hopes that this goes away.

‘He risked his career in this behaviour and the behaviour in and of itself and the penalty in and of itself of losing your career as a law enforcement officer is a pretty heavy penalty to pay.

‘I want to ensure the residents as soon as we found out about the conduct it was investigated very quickly and it was handled very quickly.’

According to the state, Mr Valenzuela’s certification is suspended until September.

Mr Edwards is in the middle of divorce proceedings with his unfaithful wife.
