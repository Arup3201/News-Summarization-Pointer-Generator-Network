Victim: Vitalija Baliutaviciene, pictured, was strangled to death then driven across Europe to be buried in a remote wood, jurors heard

A jilted husband kidnapped and strangled his ex-wife then took her body on a road trip across Europe where he dumped it in a shallow grave, jurors heard yesterday.

Lithuanian-born Rimas Venclovas, 47, is on trial for murdering Vitalija Baliutaviciene, 29, in a jealous rage after he discovered she had a new lover in the UK.

Ms Baliutaviciene's body was found by a mushroom-picker in a remote wood in western Poland two months after she went missing from her home in Peterborough in August last year.

Prosecutors told the Old Bailey that Venclovas meticulously plotted his ex-wife's abduction after learning of her new life, applying for a fake passport and using another lover's credit card so he wouldn't get caught.

Maureen Baker QC described how the man, who denies the charges, grew his hair long, started sporting a moustache and purchased a new car to avoid detection, according to Court News UK.

After UK police arrested him twice for attacking Ms Baliutaviciene, Venclovas skipped bail and flew back to Lithuania to avoid prosecution.

But he returned to the UK for the fatal attack, which saw him pounce on his former partner as she left her Burmer Road, Peterborough, home in the early hours of August 12 to go to work.

'CCTV footage taken a short distance along her route shows her being overpowered and taken away by someone,' Ms Baker told jurors.

Abduction: Ms Baliutaviciene was kidnapped on her way to work on the morning of August 12

'Then she simply vanished. That is 
until October 30, when a man gathering mushrooms in a wood in western 
Poland came across a shallow grave containing her remains. It was established she had died suddenly and violently as a result of manual choking.

'The prosecution say that this defendant, her former husband, is responsible for both her kidnap and murder. And, in doing so, did exactly what he always promised her he would.'

The couple got together when Ms Baliutaviciene was just 17 and after having a son, they were married in 2007. In July 2010, they divorced but Venclovas 'blackmailed' his ex-wife into allowing him to come to the UK, using their son as a bargaining tool, Court News reported.

Prosecutors claimed yesterday that the woman suffered consistent abuse at the hands of Venclovas who was convinced she was having an affair.

'He was telling her it was the destiny of her son to grow up without a mother, while hers was to be killed by him,' Ms Baker said, describing a previous argument.

Venclovas fled Britain in February 2011 after being quizzed by police about attacking his ex-wife. Ms Baker said an investigation into an earlier assault the previous year was dropped on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service.

'Subsequent events have of course called that decision into question,' she added.

The trial will continue next week.
