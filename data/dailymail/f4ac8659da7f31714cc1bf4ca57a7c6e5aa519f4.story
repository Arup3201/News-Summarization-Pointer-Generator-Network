Having claimed he felt like a supply teacher in his previous managerial role, Tim Sherwood had a response ready for his Aston Villa unveiling. ‘I’m the headmaster now!’ he grinned.

His five-month spell last season as Tottenham Hotspur head coach saw him gain the highest Premier League win ratio of any boss at White Hart Lane but also hear repeated questions about his position.

‘I kept getting told “This man wants your job” and “That man’s been spoken to.” It was every week,’ he recalled.

Score some goals — Villa have mustered just 12 Premier League goals so far. Sherwood said getting Christian Benteke to improve on his tally of three this season is key. ‘I’m sure we can tap into that confidence and get him back firing,’ he said. Revealing his half-time team-talk against Leicester, he said: ‘I told them to play with less fear. We need to play with a little more freedom.’ 

Find an assistant manager — Chris Ramsey not joining will be a ‘loss’, Sherwood admitted, with his former Spurs colleague now in charge at QPR. Swindon Town’s No 2 Luke Williams has been mentioned but Sherwood ruled him out and said he won’t rush into the decision. 

Get the fans onside — Pretty much sorted by Sherwood’s mere presence, following angry scenes at Paul Lambert’s last match - the defeat to Hull. Sherwood talked a good game as well. He said: ‘I think every club needs excitement, the fans pay their money and we need to give them that.’

‘I dealt with it and got on with the job. It was difficult. What was I going to do? Roll in the corner and die? I’m not going to do that. I’m a fighter. I’ll fight till the bitter end.’

That is the psychology desperately needed at Villa now. They are in a scrap and, as Sherwood insisted, ‘need to start throwing a few punches’.

There was more than words of blood and thunder but his immediate understanding that Villa have been gripped by attacking apprehension is fundamental to their chances of survival.

Under Paul Lambert, Villa scored just 12 Premier League goals in 25 games to sit 18th in the table. ‘I think they fear losing too much,’ explained Sherwood. ‘It has to hurt them to lose but they cannot worry.’ Six wins is his initial target.

The key, he insisted, was getting Christian Benteke back firing, comparing the Belgian striker to Emmanuel Adebayor, who enjoyed a renaissance once Sherwood took over at Spurs. 

‘Yes, it was the case with Ade and it could possibly be the case with Christian. We hope it will be,’ said Sherwood, who revealed one message during his half-time intervention against Leicester on Sunday was to supply Benteke with the ball more often.

‘I remember playing against Christian Benteke as a manager what a handful he can be. We need to get back to that. All the best clubs in the world were after him. I’m sure Tottenham were interested.

‘It’s not a one-man team though. There are a lot of big players. No one wants to get relegated. It will hurt them to drop into the Championship. We can’t let that happen. They need to start performing.’

Sherwood believes he can the best out of Benteke before the end of the season with Aston Villa 

Tim Sherwood has the best win percentage (59.1) of any Tottenham manager in Premier League history. 

Current manager Mauricio Pochettino is third with a win % of 52.

Sherwood famously rattled a few cages when offering a frank assessment on Tottenham players following a 4-0 defeat to Chelsea. ‘Lacking guts and character,’ he said.

‘Watch this space!’ he grinned again when asked if he would deliver similar stinging assessments at Villa.

‘If I’m going to be guilty of something it will be honesty,’ Sherwood said. ‘If they do well they will be told. If they don’t do well they will also be told. Some people need to be patted on the back. Some people need a kick up the backside.’

Sherwood acted as a breath of fresh air at a club where a stale odour had begun to cling. He knows a sharp shock is needed to jolt positive results out of an underperforming squad.

‘Right now it’s all about winning,’ he said. ‘Don’t expect too many 18-years-olds on Saturday (against Stoke).’

Sherwood will begin his search for an assistant soon, but it will not be Chris Ramsey, his trusted lieutenant at Spurs, who is now in charge at QPR.

‘Chris will be a loss because he’s very good at what he does,’ said Sherwood. ‘He’s got a different role now. Interestingly enough, I hope he makes a mess of it!’ 

Sherwood has targeted six wins from Villa's final 13 Premier League matches to ensure safety

He said talks broke down on his own move to Loftus Road because ‘it wasn’t right for either party’ and conceded he believed the West Bromwich Albion job was ‘quite close’ before Tony Pulis took the reins.

‘The longer you stay out people think “Ooh, might not get back in”,’ admitted Sherwood. ‘A lot of the time I was out it was my choice.’

Sherwood will finish his UEFA Pro Licence in September on a course run by the Welsh FA alongside Garry Monk, Craig Bellamy, Les Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and Patrick Vieira.

On the subject of his credentials at this level, the 46-year-old said plainly: ‘There are a lot of poor experienced managers.’

American owner Randy Lerner, who has the club on the market, has offered only a brief telephone conversation so far, with chief executive Tom Fox handling affairs in England. ‘Every club is up for sale at the right price,’ said Sherwood. ‘I can’t worry about that.’

Prices in the club shop for gilets, Sherwood’s signature touchline attire, have been chopped from £42 to £29 — a reduction pre-dating his arrival.

He walked in wearing a suit and v-neck jumper, prompting one reporter immediately to question the whereabouts of his customary garb.

‘I thought it would be two seconds before I heard a gilet joke,’ he said. ‘It was one!’

Villa have left it late to make a change, but judging by Sherwood’s comic timing, they have the man for the challenge.
