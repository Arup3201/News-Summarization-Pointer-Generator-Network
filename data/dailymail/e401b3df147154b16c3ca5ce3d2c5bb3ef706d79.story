A Florida man who traveled to Iraq to fight ISIS with a battalion of fellow Westerners last year has been injured in the town of Sinjar.

Matthew Kawolski was fighting alongside the Chappies--a unit of Westerners within the Syria-based People's Protection Units (YPG)--when he was apparently wounded in combat.

Kawolski, who is among a slew of foreigners fighting ISIS in the region, is now recovering from his injuries, according to a February 9 post on a Facebook page for the foreign fighters group the Lions of Rojava.

Recovering: Kawolski, who is among a slew of foreigners fighting ISIS in the region, is now recovering from his injuries, according to a February 9 post on a Facebook page for the foreign fighters group the Lions of Rojava

'His brothers are standing by him during his recovery and he will be returning to the city upon his recovery,' reads a Facebook page for the group Lions of Rojava

'His brothers are standing by him during his recovery and he will be returning to the city upon his recovery,' reads the post.

The post does not indicate the nature or extent of Kawolski's injuries.

It does, however, reveal a good deed the Florida man did upon his return to Sinjar.

'He purchased and delivered a soccer ball to the Yezidi children in the UN refugee camp to display his care and concern for them. His service has been selfless and brave. Stay Chappy my friend,' reads the post.

Pictured alongside Kowalski on the Lions of Rojava page is another American, one who made headlines when he left his country to serve in the fight against ISIS. 

Jordan Matson, a 28-year-old food packaging worker from Sturtevant, Wisconsin, is a former U.S. Army soldier who never served overseas.

But he has been fighting with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) since last September.

After starting his adventure in Syria, the committed Christian is now in Iraq, where he fights against the jihadis of Islamic State wearing a tactical vest scribbled with the words 'Christ is Lord'.

'I'm not going back until the fight is finished and ISIS is crippled,' Mr Matson told the Associated Press.

'I decided that if my government wasn't going to do anything to help this country, especially Kurdish people who stood by us for 10 years and helped us out while we were in this country, then I was going to do something.'

Mr Matson and dozens of other Westerners now fight with the Kurds, spurred on by Kurdish social media campaigners and a sense of duty many feel after Iraq, the target of a decade-long U.S.-led military campaign, collapsed under an Islamic State group offensive within days last summer.

And while U.S. and its coalition allies bomb the extremists from the air, Kurds say they hope more Westerners will join them on the ground to fight.

They call themselves the Lions Of Rojava and boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion than a thousand days as a sheep.'

They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria not for jihad, but to join the Kurds who are defending their communities against the advance of ISIS.

Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds.

Jordan Matson, a former US soldier now with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight.

Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora.

In August a hairdresser from south London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. 

Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance.

Among the many Western fighters joining the Lions of Rojava in their campaign to defeat ISIS are Jamie Read from north Lanarkshire, Scotland (left) and James Hughes (right) from Reading in Berkshire

But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, including fellow British soldier duo James Hughes, a 26-year-old from Malvern, Worcestershire and Jamie Read, 24, from Carlisle.

Last month it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police who suspected he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave.

The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups.

Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists.

It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict.

There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance.

Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons.

The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.
