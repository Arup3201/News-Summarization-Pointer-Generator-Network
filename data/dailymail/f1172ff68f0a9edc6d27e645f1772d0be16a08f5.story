Alex Rodriguez is returning to baseball later this month following a year-long suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs - but, first hes' got some apologizing to do. 

The tainted slugger privately met with Yankees team officials on Tuesday to ask for forgiveness for dragging the team through the mug - both with his use of banned substances and his scorched earth defense as he fought Major League Baseball's suspension.

Next stop on his apology tour: a public mea culpa in front of the media, the New York Post reports.

Coming back: Alex Rodriguez, seen here in his last game on September 25, 2013, is returning to the Yankees after a season-long ban for using performance-enhancing drugs

Rodriguez reportedly announced his intention to make a public apology in the news media before he starts to play again. 

Team officials reportedly asked Rodriguez to go in front of cameras before February 20 - the first day of spring training. 

'Today we held a meeting at Yankee Stadium between (Yankees principal owner) Hal Steinbrenner, (president) Randy Levine, (general manager) Brian Cashman, (assistant general manager) Jean Afterman, Alex Rodriguez and (Rodriguez's attorney) Jim Sharp,' the team said in statement.

'Alex initiated the meeting and apologized to the organization for his actions over the past several years.'

He previously met with new MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred to offer an apology to officials there, as well. 

Rodriguez was suspended for 162 games - the entire 2014 season - after Major League Baseball found his name on the client list for Biogenesis - a South Florida anti-aging clinic that was peddling PEDs to professional athletes.

He was initially given a 211-game suspension by MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, though an arbitrator reduced the sentence. 

Rodriguez's last game was September 25, 2013 at Yankee Stadium.

However, as he appealed the suspension, he waged a brutal legal campaign against major league baseball, but also the Yankees - claiming the team had tried to sabotage his health to get out of paying his lucrative contract. 

He also emphatically denied that he ever used performance enhancing drugs. 

Now, though, 39-year-old Rodriguez is back. He still has three more seasons left on his contract and about $61million the Yankees owe him, so the team and the former All-Star need to make amends. 

 Also at issue is the $6million bonus that Rodriguez is owed if he hit six more home runs to tie Willie Mays at No. 4 on the all-time home run list.

The Post reports that the Yankees are fighting that clause of Rodriguez's contract on the grounds that his PED suspension means the team cannot market the milestone as had been agreed.
