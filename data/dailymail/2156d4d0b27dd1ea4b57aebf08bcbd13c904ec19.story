Jon Huntsman couldn't help but fire a parting shot at his Republican rivals, even as he withdrew from the presidential race and backed front-runner Mitt Romney Monday morning.

'This race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people and not worthy of this critical time,' he said during an announcement in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Huntsman, a former Utah governor and the President Obama's ambassador to China, must now navigate the tricky waters of supporting a candidate he slammed as an unelectable, untrustworthy flip-flopper.

Shortly after Huntsman told his staff 
Sunday night he was planning to quit the presidential race, videos and 
statements criticizing the former Massachusetts governor disappeared 
from Huntsman's campaign website.

Bowing out: Huntsman's presidential bid never gained traction and floundered after a disappointing performance in New Hampshire

As an opponent, Huntsman was one of Romney's harshest critics, offering several devastating assessments of the front-runner in an attempt to win over Romney's moderate supporters.

'I will always put my country first. It 
seems that Gov Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov Romney 
enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he’s 
slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America 
right now, and that’s a dangerous place to be,' he told reporters right 
before the New Hampshire primary.

Lest anyone forget Huntsman's harsh words, the Democratic National Committee produced a greatest hits list of the most cutting remarks by the former candidate.

Big gains: Hours after the announcement, Mitt Romney thanked Huntsman for his support and praised his campaign

Plea for unity: Flanked by his family, Huntsman criticized the divisive tone of the Republican race and said the party needs to unite

And Huntsman's endorsement of Romney was no ringing embrace. Instead, he simply cited Romney's electability.

Jon Huntsman's campaign pulled down statements critical of Mitt Romney as he moved to endorse the Republican front-runner. However, the Democratic National Committee won't let Huntsman forget what he said. It has released a list of his greatest Mitt-hits:

'I believe it is now time for our party 
to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama. 
Despite our differences I believe that candidate is Gov Mitt Romney,' 
Huntsman said at a news conference with his wife and children.

Huntsman staked his presidential bid 
on making a name for himself in last week's New Hampshire primary. But 
his candidacy never really gained traction and he came in a 
disappointing third place behind Romney and Texas Rep Ron Paul.

Campaign sources said Huntsman was dropping out now because he didn't want to pull support away from Romney, which could prolong the GOP presidential primary.

Romney gladly accepted the affirmation from his fellow Mormon.

'I salute Jon Huntsman & his wife Mary Kaye. He ran a campaign based on unity not division, & love of country. I appreciate his support,' the candidate Tweeted moments after the public announcement.

Despite his low support from voters, Huntsman's departure will surely be a boon to Romney.

He was only polling at three to five percent in South Carolina and Florida, the next two primary states, but he was the only candidate still competing for moderate voters who are the backbone of Romney's support.

According to recent polls, nearly all of Huntsman's supporters said Romney was their second choice. This further consolidates the establishment wing of the Republican party.

Conservative voters are still divided between former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and, to a lesser extent, Texas Gov Rick Perry.

Huntsman is the third candidate to leave 
the race. Former Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty exited in August and 
Minnesota Rep Michele Bachmann dropped out after a poor showing in the 
Iowa caucus.

Waving farewell: Huntsman said he was ending his presidential bid because he believes Romney is the best choice to beat President Obama

Despite strong credentials -- an attractive, highly-educated former governor and businessman who speaks Mandarin Chinese and has extensive foreign policy experience -- Huntsman never rose above single digits in national polls.

He staked his campaign on a victory, or at least a strong showing, in moderate New Hampshire. But the granite state didn't show him the love he was hoping for.

He received just 17 percent of the vote compared to Mitt Romney's dominant 39 percent. Ron Paul came in second with 23 percent.

New Jersey Gov Chris Christie turned down a Republican movement urging him to run for president this year, but he hasn't ruled out the possibility in the future.

He told Oprah Winfrey during her visit to his home in Mendham, New Jersey, that he was considering running in 2016.

'I'll be much more ready for it four years from now than I am now,' he said. 

Christie says he can see his family occupying the White House in the future.

The 49-year-old former US Attorney told Oprah he and his wife seriously considered the calls to run for president against Barack Obama, but ultimately he felt comfortable turning them down.

'Inside me it never felt right. I knew that if it didn't feel right, I couldn't be me,' he said.
