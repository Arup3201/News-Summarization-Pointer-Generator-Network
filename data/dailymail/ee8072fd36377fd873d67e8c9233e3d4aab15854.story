Nine out of ten Britons would feel stressed if their mobile phone battery ran out, research shows (file image)

A dead battery in a smartphone would cause stress for more than nine out of 10 Britons, a new survey has found.

According to the research, carried out by smartphone add-on maker mophie, 92 per cent of British people would feel stressed if the battery in their smartphone ran out, highlighting the increasing dependence we place on technology.

The survey found that the number one issue for smartphone owners without battery power is the inability to make or receive calls, with 59 per cent citing this as the biggest issue.

The research also found that beyond stress, a range of negative emotions would be brought on in users if their battery ran out. 61 per cent said they would become frustrated, with 25 per cent saying they would feel panicked.

Kevin Malinowski, a spokesman for 
mophie, which makes Juice Pack and other power boosts for mobiles, said: 'Millions of people rely on their smartphones daily to 
stay in touch with loved ones and do work on the move.

'But all of these activities hinge on a single factor: having enough juice to keep the phones running.'

The results also emphasised the reliance we place on smartphones, with almost half of those surveyed saying that if their mobile phone died they would only be able to remember three phone numbers at best.

Such is the reliance that more than 70 per cent said they would give up having pudding after a meal or watching TV in order to have a fully charged smartphone for a month.

However, the survey also found that the impact of smartphones on daily life goes beyond just emotion, with 81 per cent saying that their smartphone dying led them to have a negative experience.

These ranged from missing an important call to making a friend or loved one angry and not being able to access needed information.

The findings come just days after a new report found that many young people in the UK have felt at some point that they are addicted to the internet.

In order to combat this addiction, which was acknowledged by more than 39 per cnet of those asked, experts have suggest people should resist the urge of taking their devices to bed, and try to have set unplugged periods during the week.

In a list created as part of the mophie survey of the most desired items to have in a natural disaster, a mobile phone came second only to water, and ahead of food and TV and radio.
