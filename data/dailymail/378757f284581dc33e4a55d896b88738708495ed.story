Tragic: Amber Seymore has been found shot dead next to her husband's body at their home

A mother of three young children has been shot dead in an apparent murder-suicide after confronting her ex-police officer husband over his cheating.

The bodies of Robert and Amber Seymore, both 38, were found at their home in Holly Springs, North Carolina at 9am on Monday by Amber's mother.

She had been living at the home to help the couple, who were getting a divorce, and returned from taking two of their children, aged six and eight, to school to find their bodies in the bedroom.

Their two-year-old child was also at 
home at the time of the shootings but was not harmed. Amber's mother 
took the child to a neighbour's home and called 911.

'I just went upstairs to tell my daughter that I would take the baby to 
nursery,' she  said in a recording of the call, obtained by NBC 17. 'I opened the door and they were both dead on the floor.

'My son in law killed both of them. He's a cop. He killed her... Oh my god, oh my god. They were getting a divorce.'

Authorities
have not revealed who killed whom, but on the day after Thanksgiving, 
Mrs Seymore called police to file a domestic violence complaint, town spokesman Mark Andrews said.

She
told the dispatcher that she had found out that her husband was 
cheating on her and that she planned to confront him about it, but 
feared for her safety.

'He has a gun on him and a really bad temper,' she said.

She explained that her brother, also a police officer, had urged her to alert authorities and that he, her husband and two of her children would soon be returning home.

'I will be kicking him out of the 
house when he gets here,' she said of her husband.

She asked for a police officer to park in the street outside the house for his return, as he did not know she had found out about the affair and, 'We have a lot of guns in the house'.

'I caught him doing some other stuff a 
few months ago and when I confronted him he shoved me and got in my face
and was yelling at me when I was holding the kids,' she told the 
dispatcher.

Police sent an officer to the area, but did not hear from Mrs Seymore again that day, Andrews said.

Spared: One of their three children, aged 2, was at the home at the time of the killings but was not harmed

Neighbours told NBC 17 that he became murderous after Amber decided to get out of the marriage.

'There were problems in the marriage and he was fooling around, and she told people the day before that she was getting a divorce,' neighbour Nancy Bikowsky said.

The couple had lived in the area for around 18 months after moving from California.

Robert Seymore was a retired police officer with Bay Area Rapid Transit in California who specialised in K9 handling, according to his LinkedIn page.

One neighbour, Nancy Bikowsky, 70, told the News Observer that she would say hello to the family when she saw them while walking her dog, and now fears for the children.

'I think of them, how their lives are ruined now,' she said.
