No sooner had Uruguay striker Luis Suarez condemned England's World Cup hopes than the internet does what it does best - come up with virals about the match.

Suarez, unsurprisingly, was the subject of many of them following his double in Uruguay's 2-1 victory, with some depicting him as Superman, others highlighting his miraculous recovery and one even seemingly looking like he has the Queen in a headlock.

Others included a dig at Steven Gerrard, thought by some to be at fault for Uruguay's second goal, a focus on a Scotland fan in the Uruguay end and the Queen seemingly looking for revenge.

Here are some of the best ones...
