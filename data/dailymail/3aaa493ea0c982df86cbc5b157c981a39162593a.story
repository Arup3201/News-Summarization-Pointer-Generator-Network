Jeremy Hunt's former special adviser was told his job was safe hours before being ordered to fall on his sword after damaging emails between the Government and the Murdoch empire were revealed.

Adam Smith said the Culture Secretary had assured him over evening drinks that the aide was only doing his job that he should not worry.

But the following day Mr Hunt spent the morning in meetings before calling his assistant in and telling him 'everyone thinks you need to go', Mr Smith said.

Fallen: Adam Smith told the inquiry that Mr Hunt told him to quit after highly damaging emails revealing the close relationship between his department and the Murdoch empire were released

After the emails were published, Mr Smith told the Culture Secretary that if the pressure became so great that it would help if he resigned he would 'not hesitate to do so'.

He said he could not remember verbatim what Mr Hunt had said in response. "It was something along the line "It won't come to that",' he added.

Mr Smith told his boss the emails were one-sided and 'in many cases exaggerated' and Mr Hunt accepted the explanation.

The pair then went for a drink with other special advisers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and he was told not to worry.

The Leveson Inquiry also heard that Mr Smith told a News Corporation lobbyist that the media giant's BSkyB takeover bid would go ahead once plans to make Sky News a separate company were signed off.

But Mr Smith said he did not remember telling Fred Michel it would be 'game over' for opponents of the buyout after the proposal to make the news channel a separately listed company was announced.

He did, though, admit that he had been 'too flippant' in the text messages and email exchanges with Mr Michel.

He said: 'In hindsight, the tone of the language that I used was not appropriate.

'But I think, in terms of the content, what I said to Mr Michel had either been expressed to Mr Murdoch through meetings and letters, or was known to Mr Michel from the correspondence they were having with Ofcom and the OFT.'

During the bidding process, other media groups criticised News Corp's intention to buy the 61 per cent share of BSkyB it did not already own, alleging it would concentrate too much power in Rupert Murdoch's hands.

Mr Michel, News Corp's former director of public affairs in Europe, sent an email to fellow executives on January 23 last year based on a conversation with Mr Smith.

He wrote: 'His (Mr Hunt's) view is that once he announces publicly he has a strong UIL (undertaking in lieu, namely the Sky News spin-off plans), it's almost game over for the opposition.'

Mr Smith, who quit as Mr Hunt's special adviser last month after admitting he got too close to Mr Michel, said much of the lobbyist's email was factually accurate but disputed its tone.

He told the inquiry: 'I think that that's a sort of colourful explanation of the process.

'If you have an undertaking in lieu that Ofcom (the broadcasting regulator) and the OFT (Office of Fair Trading) say satisfied the plurality concerns that Ofcom had identified, then the whole point of that is that then there are no plurality concerns. So the deal would go ahead.

'I don't remember saying 'game over for the opposition', but I can imagine we had a conversation along those lines about the process and talking around what happens.'

Mr Michel's email said Mr Hunt was 'keen to get to the same outcome' as News Corp.

But Mr Smith disputed this: 'I wouldn't have said that ... They didn't have the same outcome. Mr Hunt's aim was to follow the process, whereas I'm sure Mr Murdoch's aim was to acquire the remaining shares.'

Robert Jay QC, counsel to the Leveson Inquiry, suggested: 'The wider objective was the same outcome, namely the securing of the bid for News Corp, because he thought in policy terms that was desirable.'

But Mr Smith insisted: 'That wasn't his objective. Now his objective is to carry out his legal and statutory duties.'

The Leveson Inquiry today released 67 texts sent between the two men from June 21 2010 until July 3 2011, the period when News Corp was seeking to take over satellite broadcaster BSkyB.

Jeremy Hunt addressed a senior News Corporation lobbyist as 'daddy' and 'mon ami' in dozens of jokey and intimate text messages sent at all hours of day and night.

Fred Michel responded with flattering comments about the Culture Secretary’s 'stamina' and 'great' performances in TV interviews and the Commons.

Mr Hunt also assured Mr Michel, then European director of public affairs for Rupert Murdoch’s media empire, there was 'nothing u won’t like' in an upcoming speech.

Making plans for a meeting in Davos, where politicians and business leaders gathered in January 2011, Nick Clegg's aide Lena Pietsch said Nick Clegg would be at a reception hosted by the Duke of York.

Mr Michel responded: "Most people of power and influence try to avoid duke of York at all costs!"

The inquiry was yesterday shown a memo Mr Hunt sent Prime Minister David Cameron arguing the case for News Corp to take over BSkyB, just weeks before he was given quasi-judicial oversight of the bid.

The note, dated November 19 2010, warned that Business Secretary Vince Cable's decision to refer the bid to regulator Ofcom could leave the Government 'on the wrong side of media policy'.

Mr Smith said the Culture Secretary and his department knew he was in contact with Mr Michel, who 'bombarded' him with information about News Corp's BSkyB takeover bid.

'I would have thought on the odd occasion that I did mention to Mr Hunt one of the issues that I thought was worthy of his attention, I would I think almost certainly have said, 'Fred's told me X, Y or Z',' he said.

'They generally knew I was in touch. On some certain issues they certainly knew. But I don't think they knew the volume or extent.'

The inquiry heard yesterday that Mr Michel exchanged 191 telephone calls, 158 emails and 799 texts with Mr Hunt's team between June 2010, when News Corp announced its bid, and July last year, when it abandoned the plan amid outrage over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal.

Of these, more than 90 per cent were exchanged with Mr Smith, who himself sent 257 text messages to the News Corp lobbyist between November 2010 and July last year.

Mr Smith said today 95 per cent of his contact with Mr Michel was via his mobile phone, with only a 'handful' of calls made using his office landline.

Mr Smith said he did not feel he was speaking for Mr Hunt on the details of the BSkyB takeover process in his conversations with Mr Michel.

He told the hearing: 'I wouldn't have been doing my job if I had had to run and check what Mr Hunt thought about every stage of the process.

'In this particular bid, I would argue that I was actually just being more of a buffer and a channel of communications rather than representing Mr Hunt's views to anybody.'

The former special adviser said he 'wasn't that fussed' about whether News Corp's BSkyB takeover went ahead, but thought it should go ahead as long as no new issues were thrown up by a period of consultation.

He said: 'On the wider issue, I looked at if from the point of view of the consumer not probably being that concerned because they get their news or watch their TV, and don't really mind too much about where that comes from.'

Tragic: stabbed seven times, and subjected to a gruesome sexual assault when she was dead or dying outside her home in Blenheim Crescent, Croydon, in September 2005

Lewis Sproston, the boyfriend of murdered model Sally Anne Bowman, has become the latest to sue over the phone hacking scandal.

Sproston, dropped Miss Bowman, 18, off at her home in the early hours of the morning, and was initially arrested after her murder before DNA evidence quickly eliminated him as a suspect.

Now Sproston, a plasterer, is demanding damages from News Group Newspapers, publishers of the now defunct News of the World, and disgraced private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, High Court listings reveal.

News Group Newspapers is part of News International, the media empire headed by Rupert Murdoch.

Pub chef Mark Dixie, 42, was later jailed for at least 34 years after being convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in February 2008. He had denied the killing, saying he had come across her dead body outside her home, and explained the presence of his DNA by saying he had had sex with her although she was dead.

She had been stabbed seven times, and subjected to a gruesome sexual assault when she was dead or dying outside her home in Blenheim Crescent, Croydon, in September 2005.

Dixie had a string of previous convictions for sex offences, and was arrested by change nine months later after a minor fracas in a pub. His DNA was taken and matched to the murder when it was put on the police national computer.

Mulcaire, 41, a former professional footballer nicknamed Trigger, was jailed for six months in January 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally intercepting phone messages, while the News of the World’s royal editor Clive Goodman was given four months.

News International has already settled many claims brought by individuals who claimed their mobile phone messages had been intercepted.
