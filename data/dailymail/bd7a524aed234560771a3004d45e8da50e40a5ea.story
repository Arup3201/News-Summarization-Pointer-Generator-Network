China's panda breeding centre has defended itself after online footage showed a keeper apparently beating a young panda cub for wanting a stroke.

Curious panda cub 'Hua Ni' is first seen enjoying some attention by one of the keepers in the Ya'an Bifengxia Panda Kindergarten of the Giant Panda Research Centre in Sichuan, southwest China.

But when the cuddly youngster approaches the first keeper for more, the second demonstrates how to keep him away ... by slapping him on the head and sending him scampering away.

But after the footage was posted online, rapidly going viral as it was widely shared among Chinese internet users, the breeding centre issued a statement defending the keeper's action. 

A staff member told local media: 'Pandas' claws and teeth can be very harmful. 

'Our keepers often get hurt by pandas even if they don't mean to cause harm. Keepers are told that they should gently hit the panda's ear or nose to make them go away.' 

The staff member however also admitted that the keeper in the video did not do it properly. 

The centre posted on Chinese microblog service Sina Weibo however that it has suspended the keeper while an investigation is carried out. 

But it did little to pacify outraged panda fans.

Not on! The Research Centre continues to emphasise that they will not tolerate such actions done to pandas, especially from their workers

One online commentator on Chinese social media site Weibo, Jasmine-Guiguibupani, said: 'Please stop it and please take good care of them. Don't break the hearts of panda fans again.' 

The Research Centre continues to emphasise that they will not tolerate such actions done to pandas, especially from their workers. 

They will be imposing stricter regulations for the proper handling of the animal in future to avoid a repeat accident.
