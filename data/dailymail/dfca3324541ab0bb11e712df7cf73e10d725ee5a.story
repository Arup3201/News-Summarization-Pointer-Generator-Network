A speeding biker gave the middle finger to a motorist moments before he mowed down a woman pedestrian, killing her and himself, an inquest has heard.

James Fryman, 23, was said to have been travelling at up to 80mph as he overtook a line of traffic on his Honda bike, prompting one driver to sound his horn.

Witnesses described seeing the biker flick the middle finger of his left hand up at the disgruntled driver before he carried on and crashed into Janice Short.

Tragic: Grandmother Janice Short, 63, had been crossing the road with her husband, Andrew, and their pet dog, Toby (pictured together, right), when James Fryman (left), 23, crashed into them, killing himself, her and Toby

The 63-year-old grandmother had been crossing the road with her husband, Andrew, and their pet dog, Toby, at the time.

Both she and Mr Fryman died of multiple injuries. The pet dog was also killed in the horrific collision in Weymouth, Dorset, in July.

An eye-witness told the inquest that the biker had overtaken six cars at speed seconds before the fatal crash.

Howard Williams said the biker was travelling '20 to 30mph' quicker than the speed limit of 50mph. 

Too fast: An eye-witness told the inquest that the biker had overtaken six cars at speed seconds before the fatal crash in Weymouth, Dorset, in July

'Erratic': Another witness said she thought Mr Fryman was 'travelling at about 80mph' and that his 'poor riding' was unnecessary and the overtaking was 'unsmooth' and 'erratic'

He said he sounded his horn at the 'aggressive' overtaking manoeuvre and added: 'The rider on the bike gave me the middle finger in his left hand.'

Susan Burrows said she thought Mr Fryman was 'travelling at about 80mph' and that his 'poor riding' was unnecessary and the overtaking was 'unsmooth' and 'erratic'.

She added: 'I heard a horn and saw the rider give the middle finger to a Volkswagen driver who had honked the horn.'

But another eyewitness, Nicola Hallam, told the inquest she didn't think Mr Fryman had been speeding prior to the collision. She said Mrs Short had 'hesitated' and pulled her dog back before she decided to cross the road.

PC Kelvin Edge, who investigated the crash, said: 'The point of impact was 0.3 metres away from the central reservation.

Contradictions: But another eyewitness told the inquest she didn't think Mr Fryman had been speeding prior to the collision, saying Mrs Short had 'hesitated' and pulled her dog back before she decided to cross the road

'In practical terms, this indicates she almost cleared the lane and reached the central area when she was hit.

'Mr Fryman braked very hard which resulted in his wheels locking and he strayed to the off-side of the carriageway.'

PC Edge said in police investigations, calculations by experts estimated Mr Fryman was travelling between 48mph and 58mph on the road, although it was likely to 'be at the higher end of that scale.'

Mr Short who was unharmed in the collision, said he tended to his wife as she lay in the road afterwards.

Mr Sheriff Payne, the coroner for Dorset, recorded a verdict that Mr Fryman and Mrs Short died as a consequence of a road traffic collision.
