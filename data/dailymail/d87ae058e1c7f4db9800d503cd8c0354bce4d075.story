Charlton have sacked head coach Bob Peeters following a poor run of results.

The Addicks have not won since November 8 and Peeters has paid the price for a nine-game winless run which has left Charlton 14th in the Sky Bet Championship table.

A statement on the club's official website read: 'Peeters signed a 12-month contract at The Valley in the summer and enjoyed a good start to life in the Championship.

'However, given the recent downturn in results and performances, the board felt they had to make a change at this time.'

Two of Peeters' backroom staff, Patrick van Houdt and Guy Kiala, have also been axed.

Peeters had heard calls for his head from the Charlton faithful during the 1-0 loss to Brighton on Saturday but the Belgian insisted his side were simply lacking luck.

'If you don't get the results I know people are not happy,' he said.

'When you have a 20,000 crowd always one or two will shout.

'We can only do the best we can. We always try to play football whether we win or lose. Again, you need a result to get a little breather.

Peeters walks off the pitch at the final whistle after his side's ninth loss in a row on Saturday 

'At the beginning of the season we had the luck a little bit, like the last minute against Wigan where we won by a deflected ball. That's the luck we lack at this moment and we can't do anything about it.

'You can be negative or positive about it. The only thing is we need to work hard and try to get a result.'
