A disused mill in east London is reduced to rubble, the twisted metal of a crashed passenger jet half buried in the ruin. Hundreds of people lie injured amid the flames and smoke.

The was the scene as London's blue-light services began their biggest ever exercise today, tackling a simulated aeroplane crash near London's Docklands.

More than 220 firefighters, paramedics and police officers were deployed at the 'crash site' set up in a building by the Thames to test their joint emergency response procedures.

To add realism to the scenario, a real fuselage from a Boeing 737 aircraft lies partially covered with 400 tonnes of rubble and, this afternoon, real flames were flickering and and smoke billowing from the scene.

The three-day training drill is being hosted by the London Fire Brigade in and around a derelict Victorian flour mill known as Millennium Mills in London's Docklands.

Specialist Urban Search and Rescue teams from London and across the country are working together with members of the Metropolitan Police and the London Ambulance Service.

Crash debris and working black box simulators have been sunk in the river for dive teams to recover.

Firefighters trained in water rescue will scour the river for 'survivors', with actors from Amputees in Action, an agency which provides amputee actors, playing the part of casualties.

A spokesman for the fire brigade told MailOnline: 'An exercise like this has never happened before. It's the largest exercise we've ever been involved.

'We like to do multi-agency exercises on a regular basis whether on this kind of scale or a bit smaller.'

He denied that the drill had been planned in response to any specific intelligence.

'The reason why we've held it is because it's a unique opportunity to bring the blue-light services together and practise our life saving skills,' he said.

'We run a large range of various exercises on an annual basis. We've run a large exercise at the Shard and there was another in a high rise in Barking, and of course there was all the exercises done in the run up to the London Olympics.'

The fire brigade spend four weeks painstakingly setting up the crash scene to make it as realistic and challenging as possible. As well as the amputee actors around 100 volunteers from a university paramedic course will play the role of injured people to provide a realistic mass casualty environment.

'It's cost around £50,000,' said the fire brigade's spokesman. 'We managed to keep costs down thanks to many partners who donated their services for free.'

Emergency personnel taking part in the drill were kept in the dark about what they would be coming up against.

But people living close to the site of the simulation were warned that there would be a large number of emergency service personnel and vehicles in the area for an exercise.

London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: 'Whilst this scenario may appear worrying for some, I would like to reassure the public that these sort of exercises are vital to ensure that rescue teams are fully prepared should something like this ever happen in London.

'It is only through this kind of exercise that we can fully test our plans and ensure that all the agencies which would be involved can respond effectively together, in a co-ordinated manner.

'Air traffic incidents are extremely rare, but it is my responsibility to ensure that our fire and rescue teams, working with the other emergency services, are ready in the unlikely circumstance that something catastrophic were to occur with a plane in the capital.'

Jason Killens, LAS director of operations, said the exercise provided a 'valuable learning opportunity' for staff and tested their ability to cope with a real life major incident.

'Although this type of incident is extremely rare, it is important that we work together and plan now so we can continue to be well prepared for every possibility,' he said.

Commander Peter Terry, head of emergency preparedness for the Met, said: 'Major incident exercises like this one provide us with the perfect opportunity to practice and test our response with our partners in a realistic fast moving environment.

'They also allow us to examine what worked well and what difficulties we faced so we can take that learning and use it to improve our response and co-ordination when dealing with real live incidents in the future.'
