Australia all-rounder Shane Watson says he is over his latest injury and ready for the Cricket World Cup.

Watson missed the tri-series final between Australia and England with hamstring soreness but will play in Australia's warm-up match against India at Adelaide on Sunday.

He said: 'I'll be ready to bowl a few overs. It won't be bowling 10 overs, but a few overs and getting back into it.'

Watson added that he missed the tri-series final, which Australia won by 112 runs in Perth, as a precaution.

He told reporters: 'Just from my history of injuries, if we just give it a little bit more time then I have never had any problems coming back.'

Australia, the host nation with New Zealand, open their World Cup campaign against England at the MCG next Saturday.
