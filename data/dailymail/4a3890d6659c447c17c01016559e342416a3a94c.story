They fold up their uniforms, bid their colleagues farewell and return home from war.

But for many veterans, their service continues to play a role in their lives long after they regain their  civilian status.

Now, a striking photo series has captured the dichotomous existence of men and women who formerly served in the US Army, Navy and Air Force.

The Veteran Vision Project, created by photographer Devin Mitchell, aims to offer veterans the chance 'to speak without having to say something'.

For each image, Mr Mitchell, a 27-year-old junior at Arizona State University, travels to a former serviceman's home and takes two pictures.

Moving: This photo series, created by photographer Devin Mitchell, captures the dichotomous existence of US veterans. Above, Marine Corporal Brad Ivanchan, who lost both of his legs in 2013 after stepping on an IED while on patrol in Afghanistan, stares at his reflection

Torn apart: Marine Corporal Daphne Bye and her now-ex-husband, Marine Staff Sergeant David Bye were both diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2001.They divorced last August after deciding it was no longer healthy for them to stay married. In this image, Ms Bye is seen holding a sign reading: 'PTSD. Divorcing but united' while Mr Bye peers at a reflection of the couple embracing in uniform

At home with her children: For each image, Mr Mitchell, a 27-year-old junior at Arizona State University, travels to a former soldier's home and takes two pictures.In one, the subject (such as Desarae Janszen, pictured) is dressed in uniform. In the other, they are in civilian attire

Striking: Major Patrick Lehmann, a former Army medical officer, hugs his partner as he looks at a reflection of himself dressed in uniform

Contrast: Adrienne Camille, an ex-expeditionary warfare officer with the Navy, dons a red dress and lipstick as she looks at her reflection

Affected: In this emotional picture, Brantley Hunt, who received numerous awards for his service including the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation and Achievement medals, is seen resting his hands against his forehead as his reflection shows him wearing a gas mask

In one, the male or female subject is dressed in uniform. In the other, they are wearing civilian attire. Then, Mr Mitchell digitally combines the two.

And the results are incredible. In some photos, veterans are beaming joyfully at their reflections, embracing their children and kissing their partners.

In others, the subjects are staring solemnly at their mirror image, clearly struggling to overcome the pain and suffering they encountered in war.

One image shows Marine Corporal Brad Ivanchan, who lost both of his legs in June 2013 after stepping on an IED while on patrol in Afghanistan.

In his civilian half of the image, Mr Ivanchan is looking into his bathroom mirror, his prosthetics visible under his khaki shorts and his arms tattooed.

In the other half, he is peering out of the mirror, a machine gunner dressed in his 7th Marine dress 'Charlies', the Washington Post reported.  

'People connected with that picture because it showed something physical, visceral,' said Mr Mitchell, who posts his captivating images on Instagram. 

Another photo depicts Marine Corporal Daphne Bye and her now-ex-husband, Marine Staff Sergeant David Bye, who have a young daughter, Sophie.

Veteran: Mr Mitchell, who lives in Los Angeles and studies sociology remotely, started his project last August after brainstorming ways to apply for grad school. Above, Major Brian McLaughlin is pictured wearing two suits: A black civilian one and his Airborne Infantry suit

Dressed up: On a dedicated Kickstarter page, which he is using to fundraise for a photo book of his images, Mr Mitchell explains how he took just a few pictures at first. After posting the photos of veterans' 'double lives' to Instagram and Facebook, they quickly took off, leading to 'surprising' national exposure, he says.

A new life: Navy veteran Alejandro Bataille is pictured in uniform (left) and shaving alongside his partner (right) in this touching image

Serving for the US: 'As a result of this exposure, over the past seven months, I’ve had the honor of photographing many veterans from all walks of life,' Mr Mitchell writes on Kickstarter. 'The veterans who have participated have, in turn, helped me find even more candidates'

Two lives in one: Mikael Thrash, a former Navy serviceman, looks at an image of himself dressed in a red suit while sporting his uniform

Glamorous: Jennifer Hope, who currently serves with the United States Navy, strikes a pose in a glamorous dress in her reflective image

Ms Bye and Mr Bye, who served  in the battles of Fallujah in 2004 and 2007, were both diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2001.

They underwent treatment for the disorder together, but divorced last August after deciding it was no longer healthy for them to stay married.

In the image, Mr Bye is stood peering at their reflection, while his ex-wife looks at the camera, holding a sign reading: 'PTSD. Divorcing but united.'

In the reflection, the couple are pictured embracing in uniform.

'When I saw Devin doing the project I was really excited. I figured why not,' Ms Bye said. 'When you’re in the military a lot of marriages break…and a lot of people don’t understand what the reason for it is and I thought it was important for me to say something.

'I think it’s important for everybody to understand that even though we looked happy on the outside and that we truly did try for us and our daughter there’s only so much you can do when the issues are within yourself.'

Surgeon: 'As time changes, so might the photos and what they are reflecting. We can only wait and see', Mr Mitchell said. Above, former Navy flight surgeon Shannon Stacy is pictured (right) in her new land-based role and (left) in her Navy uniform, including a large helmet

'I’m very excited to get this project into photo book form so more people can see the amazing stories of these veterans.'

And Mr Mitchell, who is not a veteran and calls his work 'artistic journalism', has no plans to end his inspirational project just yet. 

He hopes to continue portraying veterans and current soldiers' bifurcated existence - including issues such as PTSD - through photography.

'I don’t interview them, all I ask is if they’re veteran and if I can come and take their picture,' Mr Mitchell said. 'This is an opportunity for people to speak without having to say something. As time changes, so might the photos and what they are reflecting. We can only wait and see.' 

The photographer, who has nearly 20,000 Instagram followers, has so far raised $4,915 of his $20,000 goal on his Kickstarter page.

Explaining the project, he said: 'Veterans' intent is to amplify voices from moments of silence. Good, bad or disturbing, when it comes to this project, people will see what is really going on.'
