Care to dance: Ann Romney appears to two-step, here, with husband Mitt, but apparently will not dance on 'DWTS'

Ann Romney has left 'Dancing with the Stars' at the alter.

After 'several' powwows between the one-time First Lady hopeful and the TV show's producers, Mitt Romney's wife has reportedly declined an offer to do the proverbial two-step on the popular dance contest.

Sources told TMZ.com Romney was once 'very interested' in the invitation extended her shortly after husband, Mitt, the GOP's 2012 presidential candidate, lost to Democratic incumbent Barak Obama.

But a Romney rep told TMZ Ann Romney was approached, but she declined. She will not be appearing on 'Dancing with the Stars.''

Ann Romney is a known fan of the ABC show, that matches famous to semi-famous people with pro dancers - and then pits the resulting couples against each other in a dancing competition.

She notably attended last year's 'Dancing with the Stars' season finale, in which former TV personality Melissa Rycroft took the show's coveted crown.

Her son, Matt, then accompanied her to the taping.

The gossip site TMZ reported the White House wannabe 'seriously considered' the DWTS offer, but the Romney rep said the potential match never really was in the cards.

The adviser reportedly explained to TMZ that Romney considered a cameo on the show only in the context of her love of dance, and as a 'DWTS' fan.

Ann Romney wouldn't have been the first person connected to a White House electoral run to appear on the show.

In 2012, judges booted Sarah Palin's daughter, Bristol, out of the competition during its fourth week.

Elimination is decided based on combined judges’ and viewer votes. The star with the lowest combined total is eliminated.

Meanwhile, Michele Obama has, unlike Romney, shown a ready willingness to boogie down from Des Moines to Washington, DC.

Get down: While Romney declined 'DWTS's' offer, First Lady Michele Obama has shown no reservations publicly showing off her moves during her husband's first term in office

During her husband's first term, Michele Obama has been seen doing renditions of everything from the 'Robot Dance' to the 'Platypus Walk.'

And Michele Obama, of course, has gained high marks for the grace she has exhibited on the dance floor during presidential inaugural balls. 

Despite rebuffing 'DWTS,' the Romneys haven't seemed shy about public appearances since losing the election.

Mitt Romney famously sat front row for the Manny Pacquiao-versus-Juan Manuel Marquez title fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in December.

According to The Washington Post, Romney introduced himself to Pacquiao by saying, 'Hi, Manny. I ran for president and lost.'
