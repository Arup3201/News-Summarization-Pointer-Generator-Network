It remains a shocking statistic that, according to the charity WomensAid, one incident of domestic violence is reported in the UK every minute.

Even more horrifying is that two women are killed at the hands of a former or current partner every single week.

With the issue raging on Avon have launched the #wallofsilence campaign aimed at raising awareness and encouraging victims to speak out against domestic violence.

Avon have launched a new campaign aimed at encouraging women to speak out against domestic violence. The singe Sophie Ellis-Bexter is one of many celebrities who have chosen to support the cause

Actress Gillian Anderson was keen to show her support for the cause tweeting her 'shhh' selfie 

The cosmetics company are urging people to share their 'shhh' selfies, holding one finger up their mouths in the picture.

The pose represents how victims of domestic violence often feel like they have been silenced.  

For every picture that is posted Avon, who launched the campaign with Glamour magazine, will donate £1 to domestic abuse charities with the images creating a 'wall' of photographs on the brand's website. 

The campaign, which so far has proved hugely popular with celebrities such as Gillian Anderson, Tamzin Outhwaite and Sophie Ellis-Bexter, works in conjunction with WomensAid and Refuge.

Both charities work tirelessly to end not only violence against women but against children also. Even the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg showed his support for the campaign posted a selfie to Twitter.

Wall of Silence is the latest latest charitable move from Avon who launched their Speak Out Against Domestic Violence project  in 2009. 

Over the last five years they have raised an amazing £1.5million for women's charities.

The original idea came from a Glamour reader named Charli Bailey who decided to speak out about her abusive ex partner. 

It's not just about getting women involved, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also tweeted his support

Nicole Appleton posted her 'shhh' selfie, for every selfie posted Avon will donate £1 to charities providing care and support for women and children who have been victims of domestic violence

Former Made In Chelsea star and jewellery designer Ashley James joined the wall of selfies

Charlie said of her brave choice: 'My Wall of Silence campaign is about everyone in society coming together and taking a stand not only against domestic violence but the fact that we are not talking enough about a crime that kills two women in the UK every week.' 

Andrea Slater, general manager Avon UK commented: 'As the company for women, Avon is proud to speak out against domestic violence, a so often hidden crime that effects 1 in 4 women in the UK. 

'Charlie's Wall of Silence campaign provides the perfect opportunity to use the power of social media to spread the word that this issue cannot remain behind a wall of silence. 

'We will continue to raise funds and awareness of this cause until women and children are safe.' 

Polly Neate, Chief Executive Women's Aid said of the campaign: 'Charlie's Wall of Silence idea is wonderful because it reflects how many women experiencing domestic violence feel, completely silenced by their abuser and afraid to speak out to their friends and family. 

Actress Tamzin Outhwaite shared the important message with her fans 

'This will not only raise vital funds but lifesaving awareness, as so many women living in abusive relationships do not know what they are experiencing 'counts' as domestic violence.'

Sandra Horley CBE, CEO Refuge added: 'We still have a long way to go before domestic violence is truly treated as a serious crime. Campaigns like this are vital - they help to raise awareness and reach out to women living with fear.'

The Wall of Silence idea is the latest in a long line of campaigns which have utilised social media in order to spread their message.

Earlier this year thousands took part in the ALS Ice Bucket challenge to raise awareness for those suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

People including Victoria Beckham and Anna Wintour filmed themselves tipping buckets of ice cold water over their heads and the campaign raised over £600million. 

Similarly the #nomakeupselfie challenge made £8million for Cancer research with stars like Millie Mackintosh and Holly Willoughby getting in on the action.
