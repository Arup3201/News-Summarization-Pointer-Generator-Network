Rugby World Cup winnner and huge NFL fan Lewis Moddy talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life.

Who is your sporting hero?

Walter Payton — the NFL running back.

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

I couldn’t imagine being anything other than a sportsman so I would have to say an American footballer — I love the NFL.

Career highlight?

Has to be winning the World Cup in 2003 — lifting the trophy and being part of such an incredible team is something I will never forget.

... And the Worst moment?

We had a tough tournament in New Zealand four years ago. We didn’t perform to our potential and as captain it was certainly the toughest part of my career.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

Grandad’s First World War medals — I recently went to visit the Somme battlefields as it is something I have a real passion for. It is so important we remember the fallen.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?

Good players have good games and bad games. Great players have good games and great games.

Favourite karaoke song?

Delilah, the Tom Jones version though.

Three most-listened to songs on your ipod?

Foo Fighters — My Hero, Johnny Cash — Hurt, Rolling Stones — Wild Horses.

Last film you saw?

Any Given Sunday.

If you could have three people round for dinner, who would they be?

Noel Chavasse — he was a double VC winner and I would love to hear his stories of bravery, commitment and dedication to his country.

Walter Payton and Vince Lombardi — as a player, coach and manager of the Green Bay Packers he will have some stories to tell.

Favourite Pre-match meal?

As a professional rugby player you eat at funny times on match days. I tended to eat as little as possible within a couple of hours before a match.

Can you cook? Best dish?

Tuna pasta and pickle . . . hmmm, so no I can’t cook.

Your favourite holiday destination?

Bermuda is really beautiful.

In a film of your life, who would you like to play you?

Owen Wilson, I’ve been told I look quite like him in the past.

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

My house.

Tell us a secret...

I really hate heights.
