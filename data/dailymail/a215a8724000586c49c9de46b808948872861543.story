Oliver Letwin is the latest politician to be caught editing his own Wikipedia profile after his office deleted a reference to the fact he is Jewish.

Cabinet Office Minister Mr Letwin confirmed that one of his staff removed a line on his profile that listed his religion as ‘Judaism’.

Staff said the reference was deleted two weeks ago because, although his family background is Jewish, he is now an atheist.

Caught out: A member of Oliver Letwin's office has admitted to editing his Wikipedia page

Computers within the House of Commons were also used to edit Mr Letwin’s profile on the online encyclopedia to play down a negative press story, according to investigative website Exaro – although his office denied making those.

Changes were made to Wikipedia’s description of a bizarre incident in 2011 in which Mr Letwin was photographed dumping sensitive documents into bins near Whitehall.

The profile was later updated from within the Commons to add: ‘Enquiries made by the Information Commissioner’s Office found Oliver did not dispose of any government documents.’

But the change was made in advance of the formal publication of the findings.

The amendment, while true, did not mention that Mr Letwin had disposed of constituents’ documents, failing to protect their confidentiality.

When asked how the change could have been made ahead of the official release of the findings, a spokesman said: ‘I have spoken to Oliver and this has not come from our office. We are at a loss to explain it. Oliver is very keen to find out.’

Another change to Mr Letwin’s Wikipedia page, this time from a computer outside the Commons, removed a reference to the fact that he was lampooned on the BBC’s TV comedy quiz programme Have I Got News For You over dumping the documents.
