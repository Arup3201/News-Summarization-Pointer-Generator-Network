The idyllic Arley Tower, which is nestled in the picturesque countryside village of Upper Arley in Worcestershire, even boasts its own turret.

Now, the semi-detached mini castle  is on sale for just £268,000 - although it only has two bedrooms.

The Grade II listed folly towers above neighbouring houses and enjoys 'glorious' views over the Severn Valley from its rooftop terrace.

The two-storey building, which was built in 1842 out of local Arley stone, also features a three-storey octagonal staircase leading to the roof.

Despite being built in a Gothic Revival style by the owner of the Arley Estate, Lord Mountnorris, the mini-castle is described as being surprisingly light and spacious.

The ground floor has two bedrooms and French doors leading off the master bedroom to the rear courtyard.

Follys were very popular in the 18th century and were usually ornamental buildings with no practical purpose - often towers or mock-Gothic ruins built in large gardens or parks

The folly, which is located on Arley Lane and is just six miles from Kidderminster, is described by estate agents Knight Frank, in Worcester, as 'light and spacious.' 

It has been on the market for a year, after a potential sale fell through, but has generated 'a huge amount' of interest so far.

The village of Upper Arley was an estate village, and was owned in the early 19th century by the Earls of Mountnorris - who built the folly in 1842. 

The village estate has had many owners, including Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and it was passed to the Earls Mountnorris in 1779.

In the late 20th century, it was owned by the iron and steel tycoon Roger Turner.

The village has a railway station for the popular Severn Valley Railway, one of Britain's preserved steam railways.

It lies on the banks of the River Severn and is popular with tourists who visit its historic church, the Arley Arboretum, and kayak on the Severn.

It also also has one pub, a tearoom and a post office with a shop attached. 

The village is unusual as it is divided unequally in two by the River Severn.
