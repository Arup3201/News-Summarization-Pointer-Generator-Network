He says four or five shots were fired, and sounded like blows from a sledge hammer. Langston says spent shell casings littered the platform.

Chicago Transit Authority spokeswoman Catherine Hosinski says passengers were unloaded. No one was reported injured on the train or platform.

The station is near the Chicago Board of Trade building in the city's financial district.
