The body of a notorious criminal who confessed to being 'The Boston Strangler' will be dug up this week so scientists can prove beyond any doubt that he raped and murdered 19-year-old Mary Sullivan in 1964 after an incredible breakthrough in the cold case.

It was widely thought Sullivan was the last of 11 women murdered by the Strangler nearly 50 years ago after Albert DeSalvo confessed to the killings, and an additional two murders, in the 1960s. But he was never prosecuted.

Authorities
 today revealed they believe with 99.9 per cent certainty that DeSalvo, who was stabbed to death in Walpole state prison in November 1973, was the killer after semen found on Sullivan's body and on a blanket discovered nearby was linked to him.

While similar DNA evidence is unavailable for the other 10 victims, if found guilty of slaying Sullivan, it strongly suggests DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler, as per his confession, because of the blinding similarities in the murders.

After numerous failed attempts to make 
sense of the DNA samples found on Sullivan in the past, scientists were 
finally able this year to implicate a suspect - a white male - through 
advancements in technology.

Detectives with the Boston Police Department
 then conducted undercover surveillance of DeSalvo's family members and 
retrieved a discarded water bottle from one of the man's nephews. They 
tested DNA from fingerprints and it proved a familial similarity to 
the DNA found on the victim.

DeSalvo's body, which has been buried for some 40 years, will be exhumed this week and his remains will be sent to the chief medical examiner's office where DNA samples will be collected and sent off for testing. Results should prove once and for all whether he murdered Sullivan.

Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. 
Conley, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis and Attorney General 
Martha Coakley announced the 'major development' at a press conference 
this morning and officials met with relatives of the women murdered by 
the Strangler today.

Davis said: 'The ability to provide closure to a family after fifty years is just a remarkable thing.' 

DeSalvo
 cannot be charged but the authorities hoped the breakthrough would 
bring closure to at least the Sullivan family, some five decades after 
their loved one was senselessly murdered.

Killed: DeSalvo was stabbed to death in prison in 1973, aged 42

Before his death, DeSalvo, a blue 
collar worker and Army veteran who was married with children, admitted 
he was the Strangler who terrorized the greater Boston area in the 
1960s, killing 11 women.

But he was never prosecuted for the heinous crimes, according to The Boston Globe, because of a deal negotiated with then-Attorney General Edward Brooke and DeSalvo's attorney, F. Lee Bailey.

He was brutally murdered in prison, aged 42, while serving a life sentence for armed robbery and sexual assault in a separate series of 'non-fatal' attacks on women.

Authorities said today that no DNA 
evidence exists for any of the Strangler's 10 other victims. This means 
that a similar definitive link is unlikely in those cases. Until now, 
DeSalvo's confession was the only evidence in the fascinating case, 
allowing room for the community, and even some high up in the police 
department, to doubt whether he was in fact responsible.

As recently as 2012, Brooke cast doubt over whether DeSalvo was in fact the Boston Strangler.

'Even
 to this day, I can't say with certainty that the person who ultimately 
was designated as the Boston Strangler was the Boston Strangler,' Brooke
 told the Globe last year.

DeSalvo's surviving relatives and Casey Sherman, the nephew of Mary Sullivan, organized DNA testing a decade ago on Sullivan's remains but the technology at the time meant it was not possible to get a usable sample. At that point, authorities decided to halt testing, which destroys the evidence, until advancements in technology were strong enough to get a result.

Those breakthroughs occured last year
 and the cold case was reopened with two of six remaining semen samples 
sent to two difficent labs. Both came back with the same results. A 
sample from Sullivan's body showed the unique genetic profile of two 
people - the teen herself and a white male - while a sample from a 
blanket showed DNA of the same white male.

Police
 then searched high and low for anything that would still have DeSalvo's
 DNA on it. They attempted to get a sample from a pair of letters he 
wrote to the parole board but failed.

However, thanks to the new 
technology they knew they could use DNA from one of DeSalvo's male 
descendents instead as the Y chromosomes among men of the same family 
are as good as identical.

Anna Slesers, a 55-year-old Latvian seamstress, was the Boston Strangler's first victim.

She was found dead in her Gainsborough Street apartment by her son on June 14, 1962. Sullivan was the last. The teen had moved from her Cape Cod home to Boston just three days before her death.

DeSalvo was pinpointed as the killer when he confessed to the string of strangling deaths to his cellmate, George Nassar.

Confession: Factory worker DeSalvo, who was married and had children, told police he was behind the killings

Nassar told DeSalvo's defense lawyer Bailey, who struck a deal with Brooke which outlined that DeSalvo wouldn't be prosecuted if he admitted he was the Strangler.

At his robbery and sexual assault trial in 1967, Bailey said DeSalvo was consumed by 'one of the most crushing sexual drives that psychiatric science has ever encountered.

'Thirteen acts of homicide by a completely uncontrollable vegetable walking around in a human body,' he said in opening his defense, according to The Boston Globe archives.

His psychiatrist, Dr. James A. Brussel, testified that he was suffering from 'schizophrenia of the paranoid type.'

He said each of DeSalvo's alleged slaying would be preceded by a night during which would be tormented 'with a burning up inside... Like little fires. Like little explosions.'

According to the article, Dr. Brussel testified that DeSalvo told him he killed his victims with nylon stockings.

'He tied the victims up usually with scarves or stockings, the stockings being the terminal means by which, though unconsciousness had of course, ensured, the terminal means by which life ended,' he said.

He added the victims were tied 'in a frog-like position,' and that DeSalvo had relations with the dead or unconscious body.

Jan. 4, 1964 – Mary Sullivan, 19, the last of the 11 victims, found murdered in her apartment in the Beacon Hill section of Boston.

1965 – Albert DeSalvo, a factory worker being held on unrelated charges, confesses to the Strangler's 11 killings and two others. He never is charged with them.

1973 – DeSalvo killed in prison by another inmate.

July 1999 – Boston police reopen the Strangler case, hoping to use DNA technology to analyze evidence from the crimes.

Sept. 14, 2000 – The DeSalvo and Sullivan families sue local and state authorities in Massachusetts to force investigators to turn over crime scene evidence they say will prove DeSalvo's innocence.

Oct. 14, 2000 – Sullivan's remains exhumed for DNA testing.

Oct. 20, 2000 – Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly says his office will do new DNA tests on evidence from Sullivan's slaying.

Oct. 26, 2001 – DeSalvo's body exhumed for DNA testing.

Dec. 6, 2001 – Forensic scientists announce that DNA evidence taken from Sullivan's body does not match DeSalvo's DNA.

Dec. 24, 2001 – Judge says state doesn't need to share forensic evidence with the DeSalvo and Sullivan families because the investigation into the killings remains open.

July 11, 2013 – Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley says advances in DNA technology have allowed investigators to link DeSalvo to Sullivan's killing. Conley says the DNA produced a "familial match" with DeSalvo, and he expects an exact match once DeSalvo's remains are re-exhumed.
