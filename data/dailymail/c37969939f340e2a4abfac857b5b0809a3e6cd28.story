A Virginia Tech student has pleaded guilty to strangling her friend to death with a cord amid speculation the pair were experimenting sexually.

Former cadet Jessica Ewing, 24, was charged with murder last February after police found the dead naked body of Samanata Shrestha wrapped in a sleeping bag in the back of a 2004 Mercedes.

Shrestha, a 21-year-old biology student destined for medical school, had not been seen for three days after cooking dinner for Ewing, a fellow student, at her apartment on February 7, 2014.

On Thursday, two months before the jury trial begins, Ewing entered an Alford guilty plea which acknowledges that there is enough evidence to make a case against her while maintaining innocence.

She also pleaded guilty to altering, transporting and concealing a dead body.

Ewing, who was the top female in Virginia Tech's Corps of Cadets, had only met Shrestha three times before, a friend told a preliminary hearing last year.

Shrestha's boyfriend Scot Masselli told the same judge he knew the pair had kissed, and he speculated that Shrestha may have been experimenting with her sexuality.

Summarizing the case on Thursday, prosecution recounted texts and diary entries composed by Ewing which alluded to death and a 'worrisome' act, The Roanoke Times reported.

At 3am on the day of Shrestha's death, Ewing sent a text to her friend Mary Meinhart which read: 'tomorrow night is worrisome... I can't stop this idea, it slowly creeped it's way to consume my black heart. I want to... let someone else decide, but ive [sic] already etched it in history.'

Confused, her friend asked her to clarify what she meant, and Ewing responded: 'just nonsense.'

In her journal seized by authorities, Ewing allegedly wrote: 'What the hell is my future going to be? an eternity in prison? Death penalty **** off on insanity, mental what the f*** have you done for that god d***** girl.'

Another entry said: 'Gasoline — must be done tonight!' 

And one references moving a body, as well as he co-suspect Keifer Kyle Brown: 'Damn Keifer some friend he f*** **** won't even help me move a g**-****** body in the middle of the [undecipherable], friendship test failed.'

The court heard Keifer Kyle Brown eventually helped Ewing put Shrestha in the back of her own car that night.

The next day, according to prosecution, Ewing went to her regular Bible study class and told the host, a student named Erika Holub, that she murdered somebody. 

'They were an EMT. They were a good person,' she allegedly told Holub. Shrestha worked part-time as an Emergency Medical Technician.

Ewing allegedly told the head of her Bible study group she killed someone the day after Shrestha's death 

Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Patrick Jensen told the court Ewing is suspected of 'ligature strangulation', which involves the use of a cord-like object.  

Montgomery County Commonwealth's Attorney Mary Pettitt said: 'Ligature strangulation is a very deliberate and personal method of murder.

'After eating the dinner that the victim prepared for her, Ewing pulled the ligature as Shrestha fought for her life, clawing at the ligature around her neck.' 

Ewing's jury trial begins on April 21. She has been in jail since her arrest on February 10, where she will remain until trial.
