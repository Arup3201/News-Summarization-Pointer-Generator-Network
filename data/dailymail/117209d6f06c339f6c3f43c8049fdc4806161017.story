She first got drunk aged 10, and at her lowest point swallowed paint stripper to get high - but even that couldn't stop her.

Recovering alcoholic Jackie Ellis from Port Talbot warns it was all too easy to become addicted. The mother-of-two says drinking 'crept up' on her, spiralling from once a week sessions to round the clock.

But now Jackie, 50, has started her first job in 15 years after beating drug and alcohol dependency.

At her worst Jackie was downing 16 cans of lager and between half and one whole bottle of vodka each day.

'I lost my husband, friends, my family, my self-respect and my confidence,' she recalls.

She hit the bottle after miscarrying twin girls aged 25. Within three years the former supermarket cashier was drinking all day and passing out in the afternoon before drinking again through the night.

'I started drinking once a week then 
twice then three times. Then I thought it was OK as long as I wasn't 
drinking in the day,' she admits.

'One day, when I was feeling dreadful with a hangover, I thought I would have hair of the dog at 2pm and that became a pattern.'

She admits her sons, now 29 and 33, were only clothed and fed with help from her parents and even being rushed to hospital with a burst stomach after downing paint stripper 10 years ago didn't stop her drinking.

It wasn't until younger sister Carole died four years ago aged 32 that Jackie, then 46, decided to stop.

She was shocked when Carole, also a drinker, collapsed with a burst ulcer and doctors later found she had had sclerosis.

'I do believe my sister saved me,' says Jackie.

'I thought if I don't do something about it I'll be next.'

A week after the funeral Jackie went to her GP for help and was referred to the Welsh Centre for Action on Dependency and Addiction.

They helped her get dry and now, after 15 years unemployed, Jackie is starting her first job with help from Workways, an EU-funded local council project to help long-term jobless back to work.

'WCADA saved me,' says Jackie, 'They helped me so much. I can't thank them enough.'

After
 decades of heavy drinking she had to cut down rather than stop drinking
 suddenly and got support with group therapy, counselling and voluntary 
work organised by WCADA.

Then last year Jackie, who has been re-united with her sons since going teetotal, was referred to back-to-work project Workways, where mentor Paul Billington helped persuade her to do work experience.

After volunteering in the kitchens at WCADA she embarked on a voluntary mentoring role to help others fighting substance misuse.

Earlier this month, Jackie started working in the organisation's Bridgend office as a peer mentor.

Although she's not supposed to tell clients about her past, she says she does if they ask and it's something she has to face,

'It was who I was,' she says.

'I can't describe how amazing it feels now. I have got my self-respect back and I'm a decent person again.

'I'm in contact with my sons again and friends, that's the best bit. I'm too busy to drink.'

She finally quite when her sister - also a drinker - died. She collapsed with a burst ulcer at just 32

Jackie even has a new partner, something she never dreamed would happen.

'I would hardly recognise Jackie as the person I first met a year ago,' says Paul.

'She's a very good example of how far you can come. It's fantastic and it's been a privilege working with her.'

The Workways back-to-work project to help long-term unemployed, that helped Jackie, is run by Neath Port Talbot Council in collaboration with Bridgend Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Swansea councils. It is funded by the EU Social Fund through the Welsh Government.
