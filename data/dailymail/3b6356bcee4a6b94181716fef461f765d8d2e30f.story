For Martha McNabb, it was a catch of a lifetime.

Taking part in 'the world's richest sportfishing tournament', the Mexican angler managed to snag a  525-pound marlin which earned her team $1.2 million.

But despite hitting the jackpot, McNabb didn't win this year's Bisbee's Black and Blue Marlin Tournament in Mexico because her catch wasn't the heaviest.

It was Linda
Williams who made angling history on Friday afternoon.

Willams is the first 
woman to take out the competition since it began in 1981.

She caught a massive 774-pound blue marlin - the second heaviest fish in the competition's history - which earned her team on yacht  'II Success' a hefty  $368,675, according to grindtv.com.

Even though McNabb came second to Williams, her paycheck was bigger because her team had entered more side jackpots.

It's the second time McNabb has finished as runner-up.

This was the first year in the competition's history that female competitors finished first and second.

'It was a fish of a lifetime and one definitely on my bucket list,' Williams told grindtv.com. 'I love this tournament and I love the people.'

It took two hours for Williams to drag her catch onto the boat, which was delivered to the scale with only 10 minutes remaining in the event.

The tournament has raised more than $600,000 for local charities, and last year more than $200,000 was donated to charity.

The Bisbee's tournament only 
allows marlin weighing 300 pounds or more to be weighed. Smaller marlin 
are supposed to be released, according to petethomasoutdoors.com.
