Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez will be hoping his next appearance for the club goes rather better than his last one.

The former Argentina youth international, who joined the Gunners’ academy from Independiente in 2010, is set to start in goal for Arsene Wenger’s men in their Champions League clash against Anderlecht on Wednesday.

The 22-year-old will be asked to solve a huge goalkeeping headache with Wojciech Szczesny (suspended) and David Ospina (thigh injury) both unavailable for the trip to Belgium.

Martinez will have mixed feelings about his last appearance in an Arsenal shirt that came almost two years ago on October 30, 2012, in a League Cup clash against Reading at the Madejski Stadium.

Wenger’s side won that night, but Martinez let in five in a chaotic 7-5 victory.

His only other appearance for the north London club came in the same competition four weeks earlier as he helped Arsenal to a 6-1 win over Coventry at the Emirates. 

Martinez’s lack of experience will be a major worry for Wenger going into Wednesday's clash, but his capacity to handle the occasion will not be quite so much of a concern.

Having spotted Martinez, who made 15 appearances for Sheffield Wednesday during a loan spell last season, as a 17-year-old, Arsenal’s South American scouts made the call to London insisting the capture of the goalkeeper was must.

Martinez could cost Arsenal in the region of £1million if he meets a myriad of incentives attached to his switch from Independiente.

His performances for the club’s academy sides merely underlined his reputation as a young goalkeeper with a huge future, but he found it difficult to break into the first team with Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski, who has since joined Swansea, ahead of him in the pecking order.

Fabianski’s exit in the summer raised hope of a promotion to second-choice, but the arrival of Colombia international keeper Ospina, who won plaudits at the World Cup, has provided another obstacle to Martinez.

Ryan Huddart, 17, is set also to travel to Belgium as reserve keeper, while Wenger will make a late check on the fitness of Jack Wilshere ahead of finalising his squad.

Wilshere injured an ankle in the 2-2 draw against Hull on Saturday. Wenger had said he would be fit for the trip but will make a late decision on his availability.

Meanwhile, out-of-favour forward Lukas Podolski saw his popularity among Arsenal fans soar yesterday after claiming ‘hell would freeze over’ before he joined arch-rivals Spurs.

The Germany striker has been linked with a shock move to White Hart Lane, but in response to the speculation, Podolski tweeted: ‘Hell will freeze over before this transfer will happen.’
