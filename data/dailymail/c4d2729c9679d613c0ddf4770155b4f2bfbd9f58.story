Karen Buck has received a complaint from one of her constituents after sending him an Eid card despite the fact that he is not a Muslim

A Labour MP has infuriated one of her constituents by twice sending him a card celebrating an Islamic festival even though he is not a Muslim.

Karen Buck, a key aide to party leader Ed Miliband, admitted that her staff went through the electoral register picking out people with ‘Islamic’ names – a practice that could be in breach of the Data Protection Act.

Rustom Irani, 52, who was born into the ancient Iranian faith of Zoroastrianism, first complained when he received an Eid card from her in 2009. 

The Westminster North MP apologised and promised him it would not happen again – but then she sent him another greeting to mark the Islamic feast day at the beginning of the week.

Mr Irani, a businessman from Maida Vale, West London, said the Labour politician’s use of his personal information raised data protection concerns.

‘I was born a Zoroastrian,’ he said. ‘I’m not anti-Islamic, it’s just that I’m not Muslim. Clearly they have just looked up my name.’

Miss Buck told Mr Irani in 2009 that the 7,000 cards she sent out that year to mark Eid – which celebrates the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting – were intended only for Muslims, although she confirmed at least two other recipients had complained.

‘My offices have no special access to data on resident’s religion,’ she wrote. ‘We made an error on the basis of your surname being an Islamic one.

‘For this I again sincerely apologise. The vast majority of the cards sent out via surnames on the electoral register were sent to Muslim households and were welcomed.’

Following a complaint by Mr Irani, Miss Buck was warned by the Information Commissioner’s Office in 2010 that she had probably breached the Data Protection Act and should not send any more Eid cards to constituents ‘merely on the basis of an assumption about their names’.

Karen Buck, who is Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ed Miliband, got a complaint from the same man in 2010. On that occasion she was warned that she had likely breached data protection rules

Mr Irani, whose name is of expatriate Zoroastrian origin, said: ‘The mistake shouldn’t have been made again.’

Miss Buck, who is Mr Miliband’s Parliamentary Private Secretary, said she believed constituents welcome the Christmas, Eid and Rosh Hashanah [Jewish New Year] cards she sends each year.

But Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The idea that you can win elections by this kind of vacuous, politically correct, cynical tactic is wrong.

‘I rather hope that elections are determined by what you believe in and what you do for your local community. I think many Muslims will find this approach to win votes rather patronising.’
