Appeal: Colm Murphy has been granted a civil retrial over a high court ruling that said he was responsible for the Omagh bombing

The families of Omagh bomb victims have pledged to continue their legal battle after two men successfully appealed against a high court ruling which found them responsible for the outrage.

Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were both granted appeals by Belfast High Court today, with Murphy set for a civil retrial. Daly could also face similar proceedings.

While Murphy and Daly were successful, challenges lodged by convicted Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt and fellow senior republican Liam Campbell over their liability for the attack were dismissed by a panel of three judges.

While no one has been successfully convicted criminally for the 1998 bombing, all four men were held responsible in a landmark civil action taken by some of the families two years ago.

Outside court Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed, said he accepted the findings of the appeal court but insisted he would see the retrial process through.

'We are disappointed, we have to accept the ruling of the court, which we do, but we are disappointed,' he said.

'It has been a long struggle for the families, almost 10 years, it looks like this work will continue for a number of years forward.

'It is not something that we look forward to but if we feel it is the right thing to do we will continue to do that.'

Stanley McCombe, who lost his wife Ann, said: 'We will fight on to the bitter end.'

Continuing their fight: Michael Gallagher, right, Stanley McCombe, centre, and his son Clive said they were 'disappointed' but would 'fight to the bitter end'

He said he accepted it was unlikely 
anyone would ever be jailed for the attack and reiterated family demands
for a cross-border public inquiry into the bombing and the subsequent 
police investigation.

'It has taken us a long time to get here, all we are asking for is the truth,' he said.

Lord Justice Malachy Higgins heard the appeal in January with fellow Lord Justices Paul Girvan and Patrick Coghlin.

Delivering their reserved ruling to 
the court, Lord Justice Higgins directed a retrial of the claims against
Murphy, from Dundalk, Co Louth, and said the court would hear arguments
on a potential retrial of Daly, from Cullaville, Co Monaghan, in the 
autumn.

The three judges questioned evidence surrounding emails from US undercover agent David Rupert in allowing Murphy's appeal.

'The paucity of the email evidence, 
the lack of consistency in the emails or at least ambiguity, the 
possibility of initials referring to someone other than Murphy and the 
fact that they refer on occasions to double hearsay considerably 
weakened the emails as evidence,' they said.

"The judge's (Mr Justice Morgan's) conclusion that it was cogent evidence is not sustainable."

Dismissed: Challenges lodged by Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, left, and fellow senior republican Liam Campbell over their liability for the attack were rejected by the panel of three judges.

On Daly, they said Mr Justice Morgan 
appeared to have taken into account evidence that should have been 
excluded and seemed to have given weight to inadmissible evidence of a 
past conviction.

'Accordingly, his appeal will be allowed,' they said.

Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, died when the Real IRA car bomb ripped through the Co Tyrone market town in August 1998. More than 200 were injured in the blast.

In Belfast High Court two years ago, Mr Justice Declan Morgan, now Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice, found the four men liable and ordered them to pay Â£1.6 million in compensation.

A separate bid by the families for that award to be increased was also rejected by the appeal court today.

Atrocity: 29 people, including a woman who was pregnant with twins, were killed in the attack during August 1998

Not all the bereaved relatives have backed the legal challenge and Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died, said it had been a waste of time and money.

'At the end of the day it does not matter if the people are found guilty or not. They are not going to serve one minute (in jail),'he said.

'With regards to compensation, people will not get any money, it is a waste of time.'

Only one man has so far faced a criminal trial over the outrage.

In December 2007 Sean Hoey, from Jonesborough, South Armagh, was cleared at Belfast Crown Court of murdering the 29 people.

He was acquitted of 58 charges, including some not directly linked to the bombing.
