The views across the London skyline are set to change dramatically when five new skyscrapers are completed.

The new, mainly residential, towers will dwarf St GeorgeWharf, at the southern end of Vauxhall Bridge, which has stood tall on the central London skyline for decades.

St George Tower - which stands at 180 metres - is near completion.

It will be followed by New Bondway Tower which developers McLaren Property and Citygrove recently revealed at a public exhibition.

Five new, mainly residential, towers will dwarf St George's Wharf, at the southern end of Vauxhall Bridge, which has stood tall on the south London skyline for decades

St George's Tower - which stands at 180 metres - is near completion. One of the newest, at 594-ft, it made headlines when a helicopter crashed into the crane used to build it, killing two people

The 168metre tower  - designed by U.S architects Kohn Pederson Fox -   will be 50 storeys high, and will contain around 350 private flats and penthouses.

The Evening Standard reports that the flats will have winter gardens, terraces or roof gardens alongside communal lounges and a gym. 

There will be a separate 23 storey 
block, which will contain around 100 'affordable homes' - a mixture of 
reduced rent and shared ownership accommodation.

A
four-storey horizontal office element will link the two buildings, and
at the ground floor there will be shops, cafes and public areas and 
parkland. 

Three other towers will also feature - 
One Nine Elms (200 metres high) and Vauxhall Square which will have twin
towers up to 165 metres high.

The next, the New Bondway Tower, was unveiled at a public exhibition in Vauxhall at the weekend by joint developers McLaren Property and Citygrove

It comes after it was announced that one of Britain's most iconic skyscrapers could be outstripped by a £1 billion tower - just 23ft taller.

A 75-storey residential block is planned within spitting distance of London's One Canada Square, better known as the Canary Wharf tower - which was Britain's tallest building for 20 years.

It will be the highest residential building in western Europe, holding more than 700 luxury apartments with breathtaking views over the capital.

Irish property magnate Tom Ryan is behind the plans after his firm Ryan Corporation (UK) bought the east London site for £100m.

It already has planning permission for the tower but the scheme was put under review during the recession.

Mr Ryan is set to enter talks with Tower Hamlets council to change the tower from a mix of offices, homes and a hotel to an exclusive housing-only block whose 714 apartments will cost a staggering £1,600 per square foot.
