The wife of ailing radio personality Casey Kasem was served Friday with a California court order that temporarily suspends her powers to determine her husband's medical care amid concerns about his health and welfare.

The order Kitsap County sheriff's deputies said they delivered also expands daughter Kerri Kasem's authority to determine whether her father, who's now in Washington state, is receiving adequate medical care.

Wife Jean Kasem said in an interview aired Friday evening that her husband is getting the best possible care and she is 'not going to allow anybody to shred (her) family on unfounded facts and malicious accusations' of elder abuse.

Stripped: Jean Kasem has been stripped of guardianship over her husband, radio icon Casey Kasem

Victory: Kerri Kasem, Casey's daughter from another marriage, is fighting Jean over guardianship over her father

In a video statement provided to King5.com, Jean Kasem says her step-daughter Kerri's legal maneuverings to gain control over her father are motivated by nothing more than money.

She says that the rift Kasem has with his daughter from another marriage is based on her participation in the Church of Scientology.

'Casey never agreed with his eldest daughter's - from a prior marriage of over 40 years ago - involvement with the Church of Scientology and does not want her involved in his medical or estate affairs,' Jean Kasem says in her televised statement.

'If the judge in these highly suspicious preceedings does not see the monetary motive behind these fraudulent petitioners, then something is seriously wrong and unjust here,' she continued. 'The abuse of the legal process has been seriously violated and should be looked into by the appropriate judicial committee immediately without any further delay.'

Jean Kasem says she has proof that several law enforcement agencies that have checked in on her ailing husband have all said that he seems alert and in good spirits.

Casey and Jean Kasem have been married for more than 30 years, and Jean claims his children from his previous marriage are making fraudulent claims about how she cares for him

'My husband is very happy and comfortable in our family and has told me time and time again that he wishes to remain under my care,' she said in an interview with KING-TV.

Kerri Kasem's spokesman Danny Deraney did not have an immediate comment on the service of the court order in Washington. He did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment on statements by Jean Kasem.

On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel S. Murphy ordered Jean Kasem to comply with court orders allowing doctors to evaluate her husband, and also allow his daughter Kerri to see him.

He also ordered Jean Kasem to surrender her husband's passport and temporarily suspended her powers to determine her husband's medical care.

In mid-May, Murphy had expressed concerns about Kasem's whereabouts and safety amid a dispute between his wife and children from another marriage.

The sheriff's office in Kitsap County, west of Seattle, tracked him down the next day.

The Church: Jean Ksaem says Kerri's involvement with the Church of Scientology is why Casey doesn't want her involved in his medical decisions

Sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson said officers who performed a welfare check May 13 on the 82-year-old Kasem found him staying at the home of long-time family friends.

Kasem 'appeared to be not in distress,' Wilson said Friday.

'He couldn't speak but he appeared to us to be cognizant of what was going on around him and who people were.'

The sheriff's spokesman said medications were present and those at the home, including Jean Kasem, said appropriate medical care was being provided. Medical professionals, including doctors and visiting nurses have been 'attending him as required,' Wilson said.

Kerri Kasem's court filings state her father is suffering from a form of dementia called Lewy Body Disease.

Fraud: Jean claims all of Kerri Kasem's claims of elder abuse against her husband are fraudulent and motivated by greed

The sheriff's spokesman noted that the officers who delivered the court order were 'basically the messengers between the courts in California' and Kasem's connections in Washington.

'We wouldn't enforce anything until we were directed by the Washington court and coordinated with our prosecutor's office,' Wilson said. 'That hasn't happened.'

Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and he was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo.'
