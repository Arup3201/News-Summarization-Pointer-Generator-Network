Now New Yorkers have another reason to fear walking over those grates in the sidewalk.

A hilarious video has revealed the moment that the team behind The Walking Dead pranked the city's residents by cramming a hoard of zombies beneath a grate in Union Square.

As passersby approached the grate, the zombies croaked in pain and reached their bloodied hands through the bars in an effort to catch and devour the unsuspecting New Yorkers.

The footage captured people yelping in surprise when they spotted the gurning faces beneath the metal cover, while others simply ducked and fled.

Once the passersby see what's really there, many are filmed laughing with relief.

The video is a promotion for the show's forthcoming season, which begins to air this Sunday, February 9 on AMC.

At the start of the video, AMC lets viewers into its secrets - showing actors being prepared with makeup to look like festering zombies as organizers explain to them their task.

There are also shot of workers pulling up the grate in the middle of the night and cutting out sections that can then be pushed through by the actors.

Eventually, the zombies descend into the darkness and wait.

One of the first visitors was a little girl - but the team wisely chose to stay silent.

The airing this Sunday is the beginning of the season's fifth series. New cast members are expected to join the hit show, which is filmed in Atlanta, by the end of the month.
