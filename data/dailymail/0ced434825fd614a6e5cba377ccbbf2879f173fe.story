Thousands of patients, including those suffering from terminal breast and bowel cancer, could be denied life-extending medicines under plans to halt the ballooning cost of David Cameron’s flagship Cancer Drugs Fund.

The body – set up specifically to fund expensive cancer treatments – has offered a lifeline to more than 50,000 patients since it was created in 2010.

However, its £200 million budget was overspent by £30 million last year – leading to health bosses being forced to raid other parts of their funds.

Now NHS England has announced it is to hold a month-long consultation to consider whether some of the most expensive drugs should be withheld from new patients to save money.

Among the drugs that could be rationed are Avastin, made by Swiss giant Roche, which fights terminal bowel, breast, ovarian, cervical, and brain cancer, and costs almost a quarter of the Cancer Drugs Fund budget. 

Bowel cancer drug Erbitux, breast cancer drugs Perjeta and Afinitor, and the pancreatic cancer drug Abraxane thought to be earmarked for the cuts.

Under the current scheme, patients in England can apply to access drugs deemed too costly under normal NHS rules if their doctor says their health will benefit. Cost is not considered.

But health bosses say some of the 41 Fund-approved drugs must be cut to ensure the body stays within budget, which this year was raised to £280 million, and make room for better new medicines.

Dr Caitlin Palframan, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'We need the pharmaceutical industry to step forward and offer better prices. The question is, if they don’t, what will happen to these patients?’

Drugs that fail to prolong patients’ lives long enough, or give them a good enough quality of life, will be removed, as will those that cost too much, even if they are highly effective. 

Patients already on these drugs will be allowed to continue taking them, but access for new applicants will be stopped. The cuts could start as soon as next year, according to sources.

Last night, cancer charities warned that highly effective drugs already turned down by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on cost grounds, could also be removed from the Fund’s list.

Dr Caitlin Palframan, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘The Fund is meant to be a safety net for expensive drugs. We know it has overspent, so it is right they’re reviewing how it works. However, we are concerned some drugs might come off.

‘We need the pharmaceutical industry to step forward and offer better prices. The question is, if they don’t, what will happen to these patients?’

Mark Flanagan, of Beating Bowel Cancer, added: ‘We risk going back to the bad old days where if NICE says “No” to a drug, there’s no other option.’

However, some said the decision was overdue. Karol Sikora, founder of Cancer Partners UK, said: ‘The problem is this is a very emotional and politically sensitive area. But the rationalisation has to be done: the NHS is not a bottomless pit of money. 

'Cancer charities will say everybody has to have everything. But what are you going to cut? Hearing aids for the elderly? Children’s mental health services?’

Experts have also queried whether the Fund has gone over budget at all. In the first three years, only £330 million of the £450 million earmarked was actually spent, with £120 million going back into the general NHS pot.

Professor Peter Clark, of the Cancer Drugs Fund, said: ‘To ensure patients continue to have access to the best innovative treatments, we must re-evaluate some of the drugs on the list. This is the right thing to do for patients.’
