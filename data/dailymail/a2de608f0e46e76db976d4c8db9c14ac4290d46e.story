Prosecutors revealed that in the days leading up to the brutal murder of Ruth Pyne, her husband noticed that two wooden boards, a box cutter and a screwdriver were all missing from the family's Michigan garage.

Ruth's 22-year-old son Jeffrey is on trial for her murder, when he allegedly bludgeoned and stabbed her to death in their home.

The latest revelations come on the second full day of the trial, after the prosecution opened last week by playing the chilling 911 tapes where the suspect's father tells the operator that 'there's blood everywhere, I don't know what's going on'.

Jeffrey, who was described as a star 
student at the University of Michigan, was known to have a tempermental 
and oftentimes violent relationship with his mother who suffered from 
several mental illnesses.

She was bipolar and had spent two 
weeks in jail nine months before her death for attempting to strangle 
Jeffrey, according to reports.

From 1998 onwards, Ruth Pyne's mental 
health deteriorated, and she would threaten to kill herself and her son.
After this she was diagnosed with being both bipolar and a paranoid 
schizophrenic.

Over the coming years, psychiatrists 
would describe her as 'angry and violent', 'severely mentally ill', 'a 
danger to herself and others' and suffering from 'acute mania', court 
records show.

In 2009, in a petition to the probate 
court asking that his wife be committed to a mental hospital, Bernard 
Pyne wrote she was refusing medication, believed a computer chip had 
been implanted in her daughter and had been 'striking our son for no 
reason'.

Now prosecutors say that Jeffrey was 
the one striking his mother, as he allegedly broke her arm and skull 
with one of the missing 2-4 wooden boards before stabbing her 16 times, according to the Detroit Free Press.

An Oakland County detective testified
that Bernard Pyne, Jeffrey's father, called him over to the house days 
after the May 27th murder to report that the construction items were 
missing but nothing in the house itself was gone.

The defense has suggested that the 
brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing 
was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News.

Detective Steve Zdravaovski also said 
that traces of Ruth's blood was found in the drain of the upstairs tub, 
implying that the murderer went to the first floor to clean after the 
afternoon murder.

The murder trial of a star athlete and
school ace accused of brutally murdering his mother began Friday and 
prosecutors decided to start by playing the shocking 911 tapes that 
catch the horrific scene of the crime.

'She's laying in the garage,' Bernard Pyne is heard saying. 'There's blood everywhere. I don't know what's going on.'

According to ABC. , the accused Mr Pyne sat expressionless through the opening statements.

He was arrested five months after the murder and held without bond for more than a year.

Prosecutors showed jurors photos of 
the blisters on Jeffrey's hands hours after the murder. He explained the
wounds to his boss as the results of throwing a shipping pallet.

'It did seem odd to me,' his boss, 
farmer William Cartwright said. 'I expected more of a splinter or scrape
than what looked like rope burns.'

Still, community members and Jeffrey's
father Bernard maintain that he is innocent. It took two days to find 
an impartial, 12-member jury.

'The people in the community are 
hugely supportive of this young man,' Detroit Free Press journalist Lori
Brasier told ABC News. 'Even people who believe he may have actually 
killed his mother still support him, and you don't usually find that in 
the community.'

Jeffrey Pyne's defense attorneys says he is innocent, too.

'Somebody else committed the crime,' they said. 'We believe the evidence will show you that.'

If convicted, Jeffrey Pyne faces life in prison.
