A South Carolina man who was arrested after strolling through a Walmart in the middle of the night wearing only black sneakers has blamed the awkward incident on some methamphetamine he had mistakenly ingested.

The incident occured just 
before midnight last Thursday, after employees at the Tega Cay Walmart spotted Kevin Hughes, 36, walking naked 
in the Health and Beauty section, reports WBTV.

When the cops arrived they found Hughes shopping in the Electronic department. He was arrested for disorderly conduct and spent the night in jail.

When he was escorted out of the store by
 police for questioning he told them the last he remembered was being as
 his sister's house in bed asleep.

The next thing he knew he woke up naked in his truck in the Walmart parking lot, according to the police report.

Hughes told police he went inside the store to buy some clothes. Officers allowed Hughes to put on a pair of shorts before he was arrested.

When Hughes was approached by a local TV news reporter days later, he admitted that had had a ‘problem with 
drugs in the past.’

Hughes told WSOC's Trish Wilford that he had purchased the Meth believing it was Ecstasy and that 'it really made me crazy'

Hughes
 told WSOC's Trish Wilford that he had purchased the Meth 
believing it was Ecstasy and that ‘it really made me crazy.’

‘I still like to do some Ecstasy once in
 a while; the only drug I ever thought I’d do again. And I accidentally 
got methamphetamine instead, and it really made me crazy,’ he explained.

This isn't Hughes first time being caught naked in public by the cops, reports WBTV.

In December 2012, Hughes was running in only his shoes by two female joggers. He reportedly knocked on the window of a home and asked for a pair of shorts.

The only thing that Hughes was wearing on his trip to Walmart was his black sneakers

By the time police caught up with him he was wearing a red sweat top and plaid pants and deputies noted that he ‘appeared to be high on some form of narcotics.’

Hughes' sister told deputies that ‘she was not surprised of his behavior’ and admitted that he has a severe drug problem.

Speaking
 to Wilford, Hughes said he would think twice about doing drugs in 
future, saying ‘You can’t trust anything,’ before apologizing and saying
 ‘It was an accident.’
