It was the kind of wish list that a couple of young teenagers might make before heading off on a summer camping trip.

Included in it was strawberry jam, Nutella chocolate spread, baby oil, Nivea moisturiser, croissants, Pringles crisps, hair removal cream and a pack of cards.

In a sign that the reality of the trouble they are in hadn’t quite set in, ‘Peru Two’ Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly munched pizza as they wrote out items that they’d like brought to them to make their lives a little easier.

Wishlist: 'Peru Two' Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly wrote out this list of items that they'd like brought to them to make their lives easier

Locked up: British girls Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly are suspected of smuggling cocaine

The list was given to Melissa’s father Billy on Monday night but before he could buy any of the goods, the women were charged with drugs trafficking and moved from their relatively comfortable cell at a Lima police station to a ‘horrific’ one beneath a courthouse, with no access to food or bedding.

The British women claim they were kidnapped while on holiday in Ibiza and forced by armed Colombian gangsters to fly to  Peru as drugs mules.

Yesterday they appeared before a judge for the first time and were asked why they had posed with a Peruvian police officer in a photograph – and not asked him for help – if they had been kidnapped.

If found guilty of drug trafficking, the women face up to 15 years in jail. Peru’s penal authority says 1,648 foreigners are currently in its prisons on drug trafficking charges, 31 of them British citizens.

Hearing: The pair look on as a lawyer speaks at a court at the Justice Court of Callao. They are suspected of smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru

Worried: The pair looked glum and drawn as they were led away in handcuffs through the back of the court to a holding cell

Melissa and Michaella, both 20, were 
arrested at Lima airport as they checked in for a flight to Madrid on 
August 6, with £1.5million of cocaine in their suitcases.

They
looked tired and daunted  as they sat side-by-side, in handcuffs, next 
to their solicitor Meyer Fishman at the superior court in Callao 
yesterday.

A lawyer for the prosecution said they did not believe the women were forced to smuggle the drugs because, by their own declaration, ‘they had many chances to ask for help’.

He also pointed to the photographs on Melissa’s camera which showed them doing tourist activities in Lima and Cuzco – in particular a picture in which they allegedly posed with a police officer.

He said the prosecution felt they had not told the truth in police interviews, adding that CCTV near their hotel in Lima did not show them with anyone else. The hotel manager also claimed they were alone.

The judge asked the women  why they had not asked for help at the airport, to which they responded – through their translator – that they were worried  and scared and did not know  who they could trust or who was watching them.

The women spent the past two weeks in a cell beneath Dirandro police station, where they could see their families twice a day.

The Mail was even able to take them McDonald’s meals, cake, clothing, chewing gum and a Spanish phrase book.

But yesterday, reality hit when they found themselves in a ‘dirty’ cramped cell beneath the court at Callao. After their appearance in court they were remanded in custody to the same cell.

They will stay there until they are moved to a women’s prison – most likely the notorious Santa Monica jail – where they will stay for the next few months, or even years, while they wait for their case to be heard.

Michaella’s lawyer, Peter Madden, told the Mail: ‘They are in a windowless cage on their own. They have no bedding and they have not been given any food. I have asked for them to be given mattresses or I will go and buy some.

‘Their mood has changed. They are both very shaken and upset.’
