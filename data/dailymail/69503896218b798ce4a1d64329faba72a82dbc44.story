Re-arrested: Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis (pictured) has been questioned about a string of new allegations of sexual assault

Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis has been questioned about a string of new allegations of sexual assault.

The 67-year-old was re-arrested by Scotland Yard detectives when he answered bail as part of Operation Yewtree.

It is understood officers quizzed him about up to 11 fresh ‘incidents’ that have come to light.

They are believed to involve several new alleged victims who came forward amid the blaze of publicity surrounding his original arrest last November.

In a statement the DJ said his 'conscience is clear' and strongly denied the allegations.

Speaking outside his £1m Bedfordshire home yesterday, he said: 'The last four months have been extraordinary.

'Allegations which I strongly deny have been put to me by the police and to which I have given full and complete answers.'

Travis already faces claims from two adult women that he molested them in the 1970s and 80s at the height of his fame as one of Britain's best-loved DJs.

He said that his 'reputation had been tarnished and dragged through the mud', adding that bosses at Magic AM have said they want him 'back on air'.

Since the arrest, the broadcaster said that he had 'lost faith in people' but thanked members of the public and those in the showbusiness industry for their 'amazing support'.

Travis had earlier declined to comment on the new claims or his re-arrest, saying: 'I have been into a police station and I have had a chat with them and that is it. They have told me they will make a decision in April.

‘I have not been charged with anything and that is it at the moment. I have to wait until they make up their minds.’

Travis, whose Magic AM show has been taken off air, has told friends he is in ‘no man’s land’ and ‘limbo’ until police complete their inquiries.

Appalled: Travis speaks to the media shortly after his arrest last year to deny claims he molested two adult women in the 1970s and 80s at the height of his fame as one of Britain's best-loved DJs

Shortly after his arrest last year, he denied being a sexual predator and claimed he was simply a ‘man who loves women.’

The
 former Radio 1 presenter, nicknamed DLT and The Hairy Cornflake, said 
he was accused of ‘squeezing the boobs of a couple of women’.

He said none of the allegations involve children and said he was appalled to have his name linked to disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile.

Travis was the fourth suspect to 
arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the high-profile inquiry 
kick-started by the Savile scandal.

In
 November, he was held on suspicion of groping former Sky presenter 
Vivien Creegor, 55, while she was reading the news on Radio 4.

A second unnamed woman has claimed Travis sexually assaulted her after inviting her into his studio to help him select his next music track.

Speaking about the original claims, Travis said: ‘I don't even want to be mentioned in the same breath as Savile. We know about Savile - it's frightening.

‘I don't want to be in the same boat. It's too easy, just too easy to make allegations and it's also too easy to pick a target like me.’

Travis, real name David Patrick Griffin, found fame in 1978 when he took over the Radio 1 breakfast show from Noel Edmonds.

The
 star, who lives with wife Marianne and their two dogs, was also a 
regular host of Top Of The Pops alongside Savile in the 1970s and 80s.

Others
 arrested as part of Yewtree include pop paedophile Gary Glitter, 68, PR
 supremo Max Clifford, 69, and comedian Jim Davidson, 59.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘A man in his 60s returned on bail on Monday.

‘On
 his return he was further arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in 
connection with further allegations made to Operation Yewtree.’

DJ Dave Lee Travis insisted yesterday that his 'conscience is clear' and denied any wrongdoing after he was arrested for a second time over sexual assault allegations.

The 67-year-old was originally arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal in November.

He answered bail on Monday and was re-arrested in connection with further allegations, and later bailed until April.

Speaking outside his home in Bedfordshire, he said: 'The last four months have been extraordinary. Allegations which I strongly deny have been put to me by the police and to which I have given full and complete answers. I have fully co-operated and my conscience is clear.'

At the time of his arrest in November, Travis denied any wrongdoing and stressed that the allegations against him had nothing to do with children.

Yesterday he said he is one of many people facing claims under Operation Yewtree.

He said: 'It is public knowledge that they are carrying out a wide-ranging investigation concerning allegations made against many people over many decades. I'm simply one of those people.

'I ask you to take into account that I was not and have not been charged with anything by the police. I repeat that: I have not been charged on anything by the police.'

The Magic AM presenter, who was taken off air in the wake of his first arrest, said those close to him have been 'extremely distressed' at the way he has been treated.

He said: 'I deny any wrongdoing whatsoever, notwithstanding this my reputation has been tarnished and dragged through the mud.

'My wife and I and close friends have been extremely distressed by this treatment and I have lost faith in people who have conducted themselves in such a spiteful way, causing hurt and upset for the sake of sensationalism and for the purpose of selling newspapers.

'On the other hand, I have had amazing support from many people in the business, in the public, listeners, all over the place, for which I am truly grateful.

'I am a broadcaster who has now been off the air for the longest period ever in my 50 years behind a microphone. That's because of this current situation.

'My bosses on the Magic network have also told me they want me back on air just as soon as this is all settled and I am also obviously very grateful for their support.

'I will not be making any further public comment and I would ask you please to respect my privacy at this time.'
