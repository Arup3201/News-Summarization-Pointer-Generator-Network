It is miles away from his life as a surgeon in the suburbs of Brisbane, but Neil Wetzig is about to return to his second home - a hospital in the very poor and very dangerous city of Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

It will be the 11th trip for the 58-year-old and the 10th for his wife Gwen, 60, to the hospital, which is located in the most dangerous part of the country, where rebel fighting is common and some of the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide live in the jungle.

The couple, who have two children and four grandchildren began packing up their lives for a month each year and travelling to the troubled nation, after first visiting the hospital in 2003.

'[A Congolese doctor] took me around the hospital and I could see the potential, and I thought we’ve got the expertise, we could do something about this,' said Neil.

Neil and Gwen Wetzig have been travelling to the Democratic Republic of Congo since 2003, where they work at a local hospital treating locals and training doctors

Neil has treated child soldiers and other victims of the civil war, which has been raging in the country since 1996

Over the years the couple have been shelled, treated wounded soldiers who were involved in a gunfight outside the hospital, been forced to evacuate to Rwanda, and treated local people who have suffered in ways that defy comprehension.

Once Neil, a Brisbane father-of-two and grandfather-of-four, was at the hospital when someone came in who had been shot in a skirmish in the civil war.

'I had my passport in the top pocket of my theatre scrubs…. I operated on him and I got blood on it,' he said.

'My passport was stained with Congolese blood,' he said, a somewhat apt summary of his commitment to the troubled country.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has suffered through civil war since 1998 and since then an estimated six million people have been killed in the conflict, most through dispossession and malnourishment, rather than through direct fighting.

The horrors are particularly acute for women and the DR Congo is currently thought to have the highest rate of sexual violence of any country in the world.

When Neil arrived at the hospital, it was run-down and under-resourced and he saw the opportunity to train up local doctors and make a difference in the lives of the local Congolese

A very common condition that Neil treats at the hospital is goitres, which are caused by thyroid issues, most commonly resulting from an iodine deficiency

Neil says that some of the things he has seen – some of which are too graphic to mention here – make him believe 'it is an evil place'.

'Last year I was introduced to this young lad, 13 or 14, he was one of the soldiers [in the war].

'Because our hospital has the mandate of treating everyone who comes to them, in one ward we had child soldiers and the Congolese army fighting them.

'We've seen some pretty horrific things done to women, it's a key centre for fistula repair, which is due in many cases to sexual assault.'

But it is also a place that has captured his heart and that of his wife, and prompts them to make return visits each year, taking teams of Australian doctors and nurses to train local hospital staff and provide medical care to locals.

Each time the couple visit, and Neil is due to make his 11th visit this year, they pay their own way, which costs about $6,000 for each of them.

They also foot the bill for in-patient care at the hospital while they are there, so as not to exhaust the budget of the hospital, which is often inundated with patients requiring surgery when they know that the Australian doctors are coming.

One of the great challenges of being in the DR Congo, says Neil, is coming up with innovative ways of treating people in less than optimal conditions.

'You don't have the resources, you've got to improvise and use what you have,' he said.

On his first visit, Neil found a hospital in the process of being rebuilt after being destroyed in a volcano blast in 2002.

It had limited equipment and what equipment it did have would often blow due to power surges, as well as having no running water. Scrubbing up before surgeries required an assistant to hold up a bucket of water with holes poked in the side to create a flow of clean water for Neil to use.

'Our Congolese daughter': Mila arrived at the hospital after attempting suicide in 2009. After an operation by Neil she is now flourishing and has been adopted and financially supported by Neil and Gwen

Neil and Gwen paid Mila to study accountancy and she now works at the hospital managing the hospital's finances

The HEAL Africa Hospital was shelled a few years ago as part of the civil war, while Neil and Gwen were working there

Once, a three-year-old boy named Kuba was brought in to the hospital after swallowing a metal object, which got stuck in his airway, went septic and developed into pneumonia.

'We knew in Australia we would have the equipment to get that out, but we didn't in the Congo. We worked with the Congolese staff and said, “What have you got?” and used an endoscope, we eventually got this little metal stud out of his airway.

'Who knows what this three-year-old will go on to be? He could be a great leader in the country.'

For Gwen, it is the relationships that keep her passion for the work alive, despite the difficult and dangerous conditions.

'We go back every year and they truly value that, that's a sign to them that we do really care,' she said.

One of the most enduring relationships the couple has is with a young woman named Mila, who was brought to the hospital in 2009 after she tried to take her own life by swallowing battery acid.

The incident resulted in the narrowing of her oesophagus, making it impossible for her to eat.

In Australia, this would be treated by surgery that involved opening her chest, which was not an option at the under-resourced Congolese hospital.

'We had to work out a way to do the surgery in our context,' said Neil, who was able to put a piece of her large intestine up through her chest, a surgery he had never performed before, allowing her to eat normally once again.

'She asked us could she be our Congolese daughter,' said Neil.

Since then he and Gwen were able to support Mila through her accountancy training and she now works at the hospital managing its finances. Mila's income is sent back to her family and she has funded her sister's university studies.

'Five or six hours of stress in the operating theatre for me and it has made such a large difference in her life,' said Neil.

The Wetzigs, who are both Christians and are motivated by their faith to continue their work, have funded the training of many doctors and nurses who work at the Goma Hospital.

In 2010 they started AusHEAL a not-for-profit organisation to help people make contributions to the hospital and the work the Wetzigs do there. They are currently raising funds to provide scholarships to Congolese doctors to further their training and to purchase monitoring equipment for the hospital.

The hospital is located in the north-east of the country, which is plagued by rebel fighting

The fighting in the DR Congo has claimed the lives of up to six million people since it began in 1996
