'Happy birthday Sarah!': Chris Christie skipped the annual governor's dinner at the White House in order to celebrate his daughter's 18th birthday

New Jersey governor Chris Christie was a no-show Sunday night to the annual White House gala dinner held for all the states' top executives amid speculation he's dodging additional scrutiny in the wake of the Bridgegate scandal.

Christie did travel to Washington for this year's gathering of all the governors but reportedly went back to the Garden State during the glitzy dinner with the excuse that it's his daughter's 18th birthday.

Christie's conspicuous absence, though he's explained it away, has many wondering if the Republican Party is distancing itself from the man who was once their strongest contender for the 2016 presidential ticket.

President Barack Obama invited all 
state governors, many eyeing runs at the presidency in 2016 and beyond, 
to 'make yourselves at home' during the black-tie dinner at the White 
House on Sunday.

First lady 
Michelle Obama was flanked by two Republicans often cited as potential 
2016 contenders: Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Mike Pence of 
Indiana.

Vice President 
Joe Biden, weighing a third run at the presidency in 2016, was seated 
between Wisconsin Republican Scott Walker and Massachusetts Democrat 
Deval Patrick, both thought to be potential candidates.

Just last year at the gala, it was Chris Christie who was seen alongside the first lady in photos of the event.

In the intervening year, Christie's reputation as a no-nonsense leader has taken a brutal beating.

Scandal
 erupted in his state six weeks ago when internal emails revealed that 
senior members of the Christie administration ordered traffic lanes 
closed near the George Washington Bridge, perhaps to punish a Democratic
 mayor.

The closures created days of gridlock that ensnared commuters, schoolchildren and emergency responders.Federal authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, while state lawmakers are pursuing their own civil probe. Christie has denied personal involvement, but five people close to him have been fired or have resigned.

Republican governors seemed keen on avoiding questions about Christie's leadership of the organization responsible for electing GOP governors.

Republicans face a challenging 
political map going into the November midterm contests. They are 
defending 22 of the 36 governor seats up for election, including six in 
states that President Barack Obama carried twice.

Wisconsin
 Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican and potential 2016 candidate, told 
reporters that there was 'great support' for Christie among fellow GOP 
governors.

'I think for 
many of us who talked to Chris the last few months, we feel ultimately 
he's laid out what the facts are and acted on that and we support him 
both being governor and as RGA chair,' Walker said.

Michigan
 Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who faces his first re-election this fall,
 said he appreciates Christie's support as chairman of the governors 
association but declined to say whether he wanted Christie to visit 
Michigan on his behalf.

'I have a good relationship with 
Governor Christie,' Snyder said when asked whether he would campaign 
alongside Christie. 'If he's probably coming it's probably in the 
context of fundraising.'

Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said that she and other governors are trying not to 'get distracted by all this noise.'

Next
 week Christie is scheduled to lead his second New Jersey town 
hall-style meeting in as many weeks. He is also set to maintain an 
aggressive national travel schedule in the coming months.

The
 Republican Governors Association already announced his plans to travel 
to Texas, Massachusetts, Georgia, Connecticut and Utah and the 
association's executive director, Phil Cox, said that's just the 
beginning.

'I know we've got 10 to 12 trips 
planned over the next two to three months,' Cox said. 'You're going to 
see Governor Christie and many of our governors out across the country 
campaigning for our candidates.'

Of the New Jersey scandal, Cox said, "I don't see it as an issue."

Democrats
 are using Christie's struggles, along with the recent indictment of 
former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, to undercut the message of 
Republican governors acting as change agents. Party officials also 
jumped on the disclosure in Wisconsin this week of tens of thousands of 
emails that appeared to mix official and campaign business while Walker 
was serving as county executive and running for governor in 2010, a 
campaign he won.

At the 
governor's meeting Saturday, Walker downplayed the documents as "old 
news," adding that while that investigation is closed, Christie's 
problems are "just beginning."

Michael
 Czin, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said, 
"Especially as other Republican candidates and governors bring Christie 
in to campaign for them, we're going to continue to talk about how he 
got things done in New Jersey."

Mitt
 Romney, the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee, is expected to attend a 
Christie fundraiser in Boston next week. The event, like all of 
Christie's national fundraising appearances so far, is expected to be 
private.
