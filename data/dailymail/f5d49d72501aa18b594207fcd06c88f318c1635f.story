When Dorothy Sims, a blonde divorcee from Nottinghamshire, met her future husband Rafaa, she was instantly smitten - but was shocked when he revealed that he felt the same way.

For at 70, Dorothy was almost 50 years older than the Tunisian waiter who had caught her eye during an all-girls holiday.

After a whirlwind romance, the couple married in 2007 and, to begin with, were blissfully happy together.

In love: Dorothy, now 77, was smitten with Tunisian waiter Rafaa, now 28, and the couple married in 2007

Whirlwind romance: The couple wed less than a year after meeting when Rafaa was just 21

But after Rafaa was refused a UK visa, things began to fall apart and the couple are now divorced, while Rafaa, now 28, has relocated to Saudi Arabia.

Despite her heartbreak, Dorothy says she has many happy memories of Rafaa and would do it all again if she got the chance.

'I went to Tunisia with my sister and her friends,' says Dorothy of her fateful first meeting with Rafaa in 2006.

'I'd never been very far in my life and it was very exciting. There were five of us, all single ladies having a really nice time.'

While relaxing by the pool, Dorothy's sister and friends began chatting to one of the waiters and while she found him attractive, she had no idea that the feeling might be mutual.

'I didn't know all these young men chased English women,' she remembers. 'I had no idea! There was an instant attraction between me and this waiter but I never did anything, I never said anything.

'Then he sent me this little note: "Would I like to go for a coffee?" Out of the blue. And I said to my sister: "Is he crackers? What does he want with an old biddy like me when there's all these young birds around?"'

Despite her misgivings, Dorothy decided to go and meet him anyway - and was soon smitten. 'I knew there was a relationship brewing,' she says. 'He'd planted it in my head and I knew.'

Things swiftly became serious and eventually, Rafaa invited her to meet his family, who lived in Karawan, a tiny town in the far south of Tunisia.

'They lived out in the desert,' she remembers. 'All his family lived there, everybody. Cousins, his grandmother, the lot.

'They came in droves to come and say hello to me because they'd never seen an English lady with blonde hair and blue eyes before.'

Culture shock: Rafaa's home in the desert town of Karawan near Sousse was unlike anything Dorothy knew

Misgivings: Despite her concerns, the couple married and Rafaa applied for a British visa but was denied

But despite the warm welcome, cultural differences swiftly became apparent. 'His mum had made a room for us with a mattress on the floor and no door on,' she laughs.

'I didn't know how I was going to sleep there with him and I was shocked because they're Muslims and I didn't think they'd do anything like that.

'We only stayed there two days,' she adds. 'I couldn't live like that. There was no bath, no shower and the toilet was horrendous. It was a hole in the floor and you had to stand over it straddle-legged.'

Despite the discomforts, Dorothy was falling more and more in love with Rafaa and found herself liking his family, despite their constant questions about whether or not the two would marry.

'When we were at his mum's, they kept saying: "Will you marry Rafaa?" and I said: "Goodness me, no! No, no, no! I've got no intention of getting married."

'I'd already been divorced 40-odd years from my first husband, who is now dead. They kept saying, "You must think about it Dorothy".'

Deeply in love, she decided to take the plunge and the couple married in a ceremony held at a registry office in nearby Sousse.

Although 21-year-old Rafaa's mother and aunt were there to see it, none of Dorothy's friends or family came to the wedding.

Instead, an overjoyed Dorothy sent text messages to her relations following the ceremony and settled down to enjoy the wonderful weeks that followed.

'Age wasn't a big issue at all,' she adds. 'Well, it was, it was in the beginning, because he loves kids but we talked about adopting as well.'

But while the age gap may not have mattered, their living arrangements did and disaster struck when Rafaa was denied a UK visa.

'He did want to come to England but everybody does,' says Dorothy. 'These Muslim countries aren't in the EU so they can't come here.'

Weeks after applying for a UK visa in Tunis, Rafaa phoned Dorothy to tell her that his application had been turned down.

'He rang me to tell me he'd been refused entry,' she remembers. 'He was very upset. I was upset too so I applied again in England and they turned me down again.'

The reason? The judge wasn't convinced the relationship would last. 'He said: "If we allow him into England, there is no evidence that you will stay together."

New life: Rafaa has now moved to Saudi Arabia and the couple have divorced - much to Dorothy's distress

'And I said: "Well, there's no evidence that any marriage will stay together. It doesn't matter whether he's Tunisian or where he comes from".'

Despite her protests, the judge remained unmoved and a furious Rafaa gave Dorothy an ultimatum: If he couldn't come to the UK, then she would have to move to Tunisia.

'I didn't like that idea,' she admits. With the couple's relationship floundering and Rafaa unable to get a job in his native country, he began looking abroad, to Saudi Arabia, for work.

When, after months of searching, he did indeed find work in the Gulf kingdom, the writing was on the wall for Dorothy and Rafaa's marriage.

'He said we had to divorce,' says Dorothy, sadly. 'He said he couldn't go to Saudi Arabia to work with a wife in the background.

'So I said: "You will have to do it because I have no intention of divorcing you". And apparently, he did but I don't know [for certain] because I have no paper work.

'When you love somebody and you've finished, it just doesn't go away,' she adds. 'The hurt doesn't go away, it's still there. I've cried buckets over this, I have, really.'

Despite her heartbreak, Dorothy has no regrets and admits that she could see herself doing the same thing for a second time.

'I have lots of happy memories,' she smiles. 'He was very romantic. I had a fabulous time and I could definitely do it all again.'
