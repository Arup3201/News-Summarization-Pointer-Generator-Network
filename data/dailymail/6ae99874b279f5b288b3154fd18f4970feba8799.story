Just one day after New York City saw torrential downpours, there is a chance New York City may experience more thunderstorms Labor Day.

The Weather Channel reported there is a 30 percent chance of thunderstorms in the city, though the rest of the week should see sunny weather until the weekend, when more thunderstorms are expected.

Storms hit New York City on Sunday afternoon with the downpour halting play at The US Open tennis tournament and prompting flash flood warnings to be issued to residents across the city.

Revelers at the Electric Zoo music festival were also evacuated and the event was cancelled.

The deluge also caused travel delays with La Guardia airport halting departures on Sunday afternoon as it waited for the thunderstorms to clear.

JFK also stopped flights from landing during the storms that were expected to last 2 hours in New York. 

Thunderstorms may also strike elsewhere in the US on Monday, The National Weather Service said.

'Isolated severe storms are expected from along the Oklahoma/Kansas border area towards the mid-Mississippi Valley [Monday] evening into tonight...and across lower portions of lower Michigan [Monday] afternoon,' the agency said.

The National Weather Service said cities including Tulsa, Oklahoma, St. Louis, Missouri, Springfield, Missouri, and Flint, Michigan, may be affected.

The agency also said there is 'a low-end severe wind and marginal hail risk about sunset' for the Central Plains.

Accuweather reported that storms were experienced late Sunday evening and early Monday morning in parts of Kansas - which also saw hail - , Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri.

Parts of Mississippi, including Lake Charles, saw  severe flooding on Saturday.
