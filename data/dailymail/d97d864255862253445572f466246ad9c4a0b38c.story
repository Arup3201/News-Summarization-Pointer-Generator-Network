Strangers have raised tens of thousands of dollars to help two former death row inmates who spent decades in prison for a 1975 murder before being exonerated.

Ricky Jackson, 57, and Wiley Bridgeman, 60, walked free from prison on Friday after a witness, who was just 12 at the time, revealed he had lied about seeing the murder in Cleveland, Ohio.

The witness recanted his testimony last year, saying he had accused the men of killing a businessman following police threats.

In just three days since their release, thousands of dollars in donations have been sent to fundraising pages for the two men.

A gofundme page for Jackson had raised more than $29,000 by Monday morning, whileanother gofundme page for Bridgeman totaled more than $2,400.

The pages were set up by the Ohio Innocence Project and Ohioans to Stop Executions to help the men rebuild their lives. 

On Jackson's page, the organizers shared a photo of him grinning while holding a cell phone on Sunday with the caption: 'Ricky with his first cell phone!'

The men were convicted of murdering Harry Franks, a businessman in Cleveland, Ohio - based largely on the testimony of a 12-year-old, Eddie Vernon, who said he saw the murder.

The two, along with Bridgeman's brother Ronnie, were given death sentences after Vernon testified.

The death sentences were commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1978. Ronnie Bridgeman was released in 2003 for separate reasons.

He was reunited with the other two inmates Friday when they walked free from Cuyahoga County Jail after prosecutors asked that the charges be dismissed.

The dramatic turnaround came after Vernon, now 52, recanted his testimony, saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details of the case.

Their cases were first re-evaluated after a 2011 article in the Cleveland Scene magazine highlighted Vernon's unreliable testimony.   

Changing his account in 2013, he said: 'All the information was fed to me - I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime', Cleveland.com reported.

In the initial court hearings, Vernon said he was on a bus with other schoolchildren when he heard gunshots near the a grocery store called Cut-Rite.

Other children on the bus have said Vernon would not have been able to see anything from his seat - and he has since admitted that was true.

He now claims detectives talked him into testifying, then said if he claimed he was lying his parents could be put in prison for perjury. 

When he dismissed Jackson's case, Judge Richard McMonagle said, 'Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.'

'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling,' Jackson said as he exited the building Friday. 'I'm on an emotional high.'

Bridgeman said he never lost hope that he would be freed for good.

'You keep struggling, you keep trying,' he said.

Bridgeman embraced his brother Ronnie, who changed his name to Kwame Ajamu, as he walked out of the courthouse.

All he could say was that he is unsure what the future holds other than a celebratory fish dinner.

Ajamu told him: 'Stick with me. You'll be all right. I ain't never going to let you go.'

Jackson and his lawyers planned to celebrate  at a hotel. Asked where he was going to live, Jackson replied: 'It's ironic. For 39 years, I've had a place to stay. Now, you know, that's precarious.'

Ajamu said in an interview Thursday that the prospect of the three being together again is 'mind-boggling.' He spent his 18th birthday on death row and was in prison when his mother, a brother and a sister died. 

He said: 'The idea that my brother - both of those guys are my brothers - are getting out? I don't even care about me.' 

Vernon broke down during a court hearing for Jackson on Tuesday as he described the threats by detectives and the burden of guilt he had carried for so long.

Jackson said he holds no animosity toward Vernon.

'It took a lot of courage to do what he did,' he said. 'He's been carrying a burden around for 39 years, like we have. But in the end, he came through, and I'm grateful for that.'
