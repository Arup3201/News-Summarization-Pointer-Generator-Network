The founder of an internet company that allows users to convert money to an online currency has been indicted in the U.S. for a massive $6 billion money-laundering scheme - in what authorities have called the largest case of its kind in history.

Arthur Budovsky, the founder of Liberty Reserve, was arrested in Spain on Friday.

The Costa Rica-based company, which had more than one million users, allegedly helped hide 55 million illegal transactions across the world, authorities said today.

In total, seven people indicted for their alleged part in the cyber network, which authorities said was 'staggering' in scope. Budovsky's partner, Vladimir Kats, is in custody in New York.

Budovsky's deputy, Azzedine El Amine was also arrested, as were two technology designers, Maxim Chukarev and Mark Marmilev.

Two more company employees were still at large in Costa Rica according to officials: Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani and Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez.

The investigation involved law enforcement in 17 countries and 'is believed to be the largest money laundering prosecution in history,' the prosecutor's office said.

The suspects were indicted for allegedly facilitating millions of transactions that hid the proceeds of credit card fraud, identity theft, computer hacking, child pornography, narcotics trafficking and other crimes, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said on Tuesday.

The indictment
calls the network 'one of the principal means by which cyber criminals 
around the world distribute, store and launder proceeds of their illegal
 activity'.

'The scope of the defendants' unlawful conduct is staggering,' it added.

Liberty Reserve was an online payment network that allowed users to convert dollars or euros into currency that could be exchanged on the internet.

According to the indictment, Liberty 
Reserve's currency unit was called the 'LR'. Users opened accounts at 
Liberty Reserve giving only a name, address and date of birth that the 
company made no attempt to verify.

Customers funded their Liberty Reserve accounts with payments from a bank wire, postal money order or other money transfers. It was then converted to LR.

Funds could then be transferred to or bought by another account holder via third-party exchange merchants. Each transaction cost $2.99.

Liberty Reserve allowed users to open accounts using fictitious names, including 'Russian Hacker' and 'Hacker Account.'

The indictment said Liberty Reserve 
did not collect any banking or transaction information from the 
third-party exchange companies. It also let its users hide their Liberty
 Exchange account numbers when making transactions, which offered 
another opportunity for the users to mask their true identities.

The company processed around 12 
million financial transactions per year. Since it began operating in 
2006, the indictment said, Liberty Reserve laundered over $6 billion in 
criminal proceeds.

Digital currency is made up of transferable units that can be exchanged for cash. Over the past decade, its use has expanded, attracting attention from the media and Wall Street.

The most widely known digital currency is called Bitcoin. Liberty Reserve's currency was not connected to Bitcoin.

In announcing the case on Tuesday 
afternoon, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the network 'became the bank
 of choice for the criminal underworld'.

Its digital currency service was designed to shield the identity of crooked users seeking to launder ill-gotten gains, he said.

'The coin of the realm was anonymity,' he said. 'It was the opposite of a know-your-customer policy.'

In a statement, Costa Rica police 
confirmed that Budovsky had been arrested in Spain on money laundering 
charges and that several premises linked to his company had been raided.

A
 notice pasted across Liberty Reserve's website last week said the 
domain 'has been seized by the United States Global Illicit Financial 
Team'.

Liberty Reserve's demise is likely to send a sharp shock across the Internet.

It allowed users to open accounts using fictitious names, including 'Russian Hacker' and 'Hacker Account.' The network charged a 1 per cent fee on transactions.

Budovsky and Katz have previous convictions on charges related to an unlicensed money-transmitting business, according to court papers.

After that case, the pair decided to move their operation to Costa Rica, where Budovsky officially renounced his U.S. citizenship, the papers say.

In an online chat captured by law enforcement, Katz admitted Liberty Reserve was 'illegal' and noted that authorities in the United States knew it was 'a money laundering operation that hackers use'.

Aditya Sood, a computer science 
doctoral candidate at Michigan State University who has studied the 
underground economy, described Liberty Reserve as a no-questions-asked 
alternative to the global banking system, with little more than a valid 
email needed to open an account and start moving money across borders.

'You don't need to provide your full 
details, or personal information, or things like that,' Sood said. 
'There's no way to trace an account. That's the beauty of the system.'

Liberty Reserve's ease of use also 
attracted a thriving community of tech-savvy users in countries with 
limited access to credit cards, said Mitchell Rossetti, whose 
Houston-based ePayCards.com was one of several mainstream merchants that
 accepted the online-only currency.

Rossetti said his business still had about $28,000 tied up in Liberty Reserve accounts. Liberty Reserve's irreversible transactions made it attractive to small merchants worried about fraud.

'The irony of this is I went to them because of the security,' Rossetti said. 'All sales were final.'

Trouble ahead? The online currency network is similar to Bitcoin, which has garnered a large community

He acknowledged that the currency was 
being used by scammers, but said Liberty Reserve was just like any other
 currency. 'The U.S. dollar can be donated to a church or it can pay a 
prostitute,' he said.

Liberty Reserve appears to have played an important role in laundering the proceeds from the recent theft of some $45 million from two Middle Eastern banks, according to legal documents made public by U.S. authorities earlier this month.

The complaint against one of the Dominican Republic gang members allegedly involved in the theft states that thousands of dollars' worth of stolen cash was deposited into two Liberty Reserve accounts via currency centers based in Siberia and Singapore.

The Costa Rica police statement said that they raided three homes and five businesses linked to Liberty Reserve and seized papers and digital documents that will be turned over to U.S. authorities.
