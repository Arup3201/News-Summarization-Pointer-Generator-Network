Its first season won over audiences as a gritty and down-to-earth crime drama.

But viewers seem to have turned on Broadchurch, criticising the new series' 'soap opera' plotlines and branding it a 'fancy EastEnders'.

As character Joe Miller goes on trial for the murder of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer, many viewers have also been left frustrated by the 'unrealistic' court scenes.

Viewers of the second show of series two of Broadchurch complained about legal inaccuracies as the trial of Joe Miller, whose previous admission for killing 11-year-old Danny Latimer, was ruled inadmissible 

Millions of viewers have tuned in for the return of the ITV drama, starring David Tennant as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy and Olivia Coleman as his partner, DS Ellie Miller - also wife of murder suspect Joe Miller.

During last night's show it was the initial crown court scenes that attracted criticism.

Viewers complained about normal legal processes being subverted - with some commenting on potential witnesses sitting in court, listening to proceedings before they gave evidence. 

They also noted that despite his not guilty plea just a few weeks before, Miller's trial appears to have come round a lot quicker than is normal in the current British judicial system.

In reality, it can take several months for cases to be heard.

Marc Willers QC, a human rights barrister, tweeted: 'Broadchurch ruined for me by totally unrealistic court room scenes. 

'Very annoying for lawyers watching such twaddle.'

In last night's episode most of the key witnesses are shown sitting in court despite the fact only a couple have given evidence so far, including suspect Mark Latimer as he watches Beth in the witness stand.

Wee Scottish Mummy added: 'Am I only one who thought Broadchurch was v unrealistic last night? A criminal trial starting w'in weeks, witnesses listening in court etc?'

Judge Meera Syal last night ruled that the killer’s confession – which Joe Miller had given willingly – was in fact inadmissible.

Viewers complained about unrealistic scenes and proper court processes not being followed in Broadchurch 

Other viewers commented on the unrealistic timescales with Joe Miller's trial starting weeks after his plea

Experts also complained about legal arguments being conducted in front of a jury - when this would normally take place behind closed doors in front of a judge to ensure members of the jury are not prejudiced.

The first series of Broadchurch premiered in March 2013 and was nominated for seven BAFTA awards.

It focused on the death of 11-year-old Danny Latimer and the impact of grief and media attention on the town. Most of the cast has returned for the second series.

It was a bad night for DI Alec Hardy and DS Ellie Miller in Broadchurch last night as Miller's trial began 

Around 7.2million people tuned in for the first installment of the second series but some complained that they were forced to use subtitles to understand what was happening, because David Tenant mumbled and actors spoke in strong Scottish accents.

Viewers dipped to 6.1million last night - a record low for the series. 

A spokeswoman for Kudos, who produced the drama said: 'The scripts for Broadchurch are thoroughly researched and we take legal advice. However, Broadchurch is fictional story-telling and as happens with television drama creative decisions are taken to heighten the dramatic effect.'
