Luis Felipe Scolari today named the squad he hopes can deliver glory for Brazil on home soil and had a sharp response for Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho in the process.

The Brazil manager included six Premier League-based players in his 23-man panel but couldn't find room for Liverpool pair Lucas and Philippe Coutinho, the duo among a host of big European names to miss out.

With an astonishing 17 World Cup rookies in his panel, Scolari, a World Cup winner with his country in 2002, opted against bringing along out-of-favour tournament veterans like Kaka or Robinho back into the fold.

Goalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Toronto FC, on loan from QPR), Jefferson (Botafogo), Victor (Atletico Mineiro)

Defenders: Dani Alves (Barcelona), Maicon (Roma), David Luiz (Chelsea), Thiago Silva (PSG), Dante (Bayern Munich), Marcelo (Real Madrid), Henrique (Napoli), Maxwell (PSG).

Midfield: Oscar (Chelsea), Fernandinho (Man City), Willian (Chelsea), Paulinho (Spurs), Ramires (Chelsea), Luis Gustavo (Wolfsburg), Hernanes (Inter Milan).

Attackers: Bernard (Shakhtar Donetsk), Neymar (Barcelona), Fred (Fluminense), Hulk (Zenit St Petersburg), Jo (Atletico Mineiro).

Advantage: Brazil are favourites to win the World Cup on home soil this summer

Calm before the storm: Scolari before announcing his 23-man squad for the World Cup in Brazil

And the one-time Chelsea manager 
insisted he paid little attention to Mourinho's recent comments raising 
concerns over the form of star midfielder Oscar, when he claimed the 
No.10 was 'our best player to December...but arrived in the crucial 
moment of the season in a low'.

'No
 it doesn't concern me at all,' responded Scolari. 'Oscar is one of the 
best players we have in the world, regardless of any comments from any 
coach.

'He may have some 
physical issues. Through the physical exams we have at the start we'll 
be sure to get them right. I have no worries about Paulinho, Oscar, 
Marcelo whoever.'

Scolari 
sprung a surprise in selecting Napoli's Henrique and PSG full back 
Maxwell among his reserve defenders along with the veteran Maicon, 
spurning the chance to call upon the red-hot Atletico Madrid pair of 
Miranda and Felipe Luis.

Big occasion: The announcement took place in front of nearly 800 journalists in Rio de Janeiro

Lucas
 and Coutinho, equally, were left on the shelf along with Spurs 
midfielder Sandro as Inter Milan's excellent Hernanes claimed the final 
midfield slot.

While there 
may have been some question marks about the make-up of the wider squad, 
Scolari's starting eleven, and his 4-2-3-1 formation, is all but 
cemented in place. The defence of Dani Alves, David Luiz, Thiago Silva 
and Marcelo in front of veteran Julio Cesar is a staple. In front of 
them Paulinho and Wolfsburg's teak-tough Luis Gustavo will protect the 
attacking trio of Neymar, Oscar in the middle and Hulk on the right with
 Scolari's favoured son, Fred, leading the line.

Fit
 and in form, it's a truly formidable machine, as they proved on the way
 to last summer's Confederations Cup, dismantling Spain in a manner the 
World and European champions hadn't known in the final.

But
 worries over both form and fitness persist. Allowing for rookie-season 
struggles, Neymar's form since the turn of the year and the furore over 
his transfer rocked Barcelona has been pretty wretched. Mourinho rebuke 
or not, Oscar has also struggled to orchestrate as devastatingly as he 
can as Chelsea tapered off in the second-half of the season.

Chosen ones: Brazil's coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has named his 23-man squad for the tournament

Throw
 in Julio Cesar's jaunt to the MLS to pick up game time, Paulinho's 
drifting in and out of the Spurs starting line-up and Marcelo finding 
himself on the Real Madrid bench of late and there are undoubtedly 
headaches that Scolari must hope dissipate in the next four weeks.

Of
 greatest concern however is the lack of big tournament experience 
amongst the squad. Only six - Cesar, Maicon, Alves, Silva, Ramires and 
Fred - have ever taken to a World Cup field. With the pressure of 
delivering for a nation of 200 million diehards and the daunting 
prospect of a last 16 showdown against Spain, Netherlands or Chile, the 
rookie squad might just buckle.

'The
 squad we had in 2002 was a lot more experienced. Seventeen of our 
players have never played in World Cup whereas that was maybe 10 back in
 2002,' said Scolari.

The big one: The World Cup begins in Brazil on June 12, finishing on July 13 with the final

Weight on your shoulders: Brazil will be under huge pressure to lift the trophy on July 13 in Rio

'But they have experience of playing strong 
competitions in Europe, Champions League. We know that that can make a 
difference in certain games.

'We
 are going to call on some World champions and some great players who 
will come in and spend time with us and help us in these challenges. I 
will go all the way to hell with these players if they need it.'

Scolari
 will be hoping he doesn't have to go that far. The heavenly prospect of
 delivering a World Cup on home soil is a whole lot more palatable.
