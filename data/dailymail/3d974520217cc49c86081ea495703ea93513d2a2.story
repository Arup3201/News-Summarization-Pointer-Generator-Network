Last week, it was the turn of England captain Wayne Rooney to celebrate his 100th international cap, but Tuesday night belonged to his former Manchester United team-mate John O'Shea.

The Sunderland centre-back won his 100th cap in Gelsenkirchen last month, scoring in the dying embers of the game against Germany to earn Ireland a draw in their Euro 2016 qualifying match. A fitting way to celebrate his ton.

On Tuesday night, Ireland were back on home soil, playing against the USA in a friendly at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Prior to the match O'Shea was presented with his 100th cap, celebrating his 13 years of international football.

The Sunderland centre-back topped off his big day with an impressive 4-1 victory, in part thanks to a brace from Robbie Brady.

O'Shea made his international debut on 15 August 2001, when he came on as an 84th minute substitute against Croatia, unfortunately conceding a penalty in the short time he was on the pitch.

It's fair to say his fortunes improved as time went on, with the former Manchester United man cementing his place in the team in the coming years.
