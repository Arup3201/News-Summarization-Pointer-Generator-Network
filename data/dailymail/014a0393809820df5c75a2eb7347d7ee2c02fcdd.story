Companies will be forced to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women under European Commission-backed plans to help women into top jobs.Â 

The rules 
demand that companies give non-executive directorships to women, where 
there is no male candidate who is better qualified, until they reach a 
target of four in ten.

More radical plans were softened by the commission, which rejected imposing a penalty for firms who fail to reach the quota.

However, the draft law does envisage possible fines for companies that ignore the selection rules.

European Union justice commissioner 
Viviane Reding, who launched the proposal, said: 'The 
Parliament has made the first cracks in the glass ceiling that continues
to bar female talent from the top jobs.'

The news rules do not help women aiming for top management roles, such as chief executive.

They also exempt smaller companies and those that are not 
listed.

Only about 17 
per cent of non-executive board members in the EU's largest companies are
women.

In Britain, women hold 17.4 per cent of directorships, up from 
12.5 per cent in 2010. Only four chief executives at FTSE 100 companies are 
women.

If endorsed, the 
rules will take seven years to come into full force.

Countries, which
are now required to sign off on the law, are divided on whether 
pan-European rules on positive discrimination are necessary.

Britain and Germany have argued against mandatory quotas.

Men
dominate boardrooms in the region and many women who have risen through
company ranks resent quotas because they suggest that women have not 
been promoted on merit.

Only
Norway, which is not a member of the bloc, has enforced a 40 per cent 
quota since 2009, although critics say this has been achieved in part 
thanks to a small number of women holding non-executive positions in 
multiple companies.

'It is 
essential for listed companies to evolve so as to include highly skilled
women in their decision-making processes,' said Rodi 
Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, a member of the parliament who is playing a 
central role in shaping the law.
