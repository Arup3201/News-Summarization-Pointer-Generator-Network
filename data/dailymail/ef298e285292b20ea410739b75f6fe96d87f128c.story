Britain's ambassador to Iran last night revealed how seven of his staff were seized by protesters during the terrifying attack on UK compounds in Tehran.

Dominick Chilcott said some workers and their relatives were sent to the embassy’s residential complex in the north of the city before the protests for their safety, but ended up being taken by demonstrators who surged through security.

He spoke out as the last Iranian diplomats left the UK following a decision to close their London base in response to the attacks.

On Wednesday Foreign Secretary William Hague gave Iran 48 hours to remove all staff from UK soil in response to the ‘outrageous and indefensible’ incident.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘I can confirm that, earlier this afternoon, all diplomatic staff of the Iranian Embassy in London took off from Heathrow airport.’

Last night Mr Chilcott told how one of his staff at the Tehran residential complex barricaded himself in a panic room for 45 minutes before he was overcome and held with six colleagues.

He said staff were in a worse predicament than those in the main embassy as they had gone there thinking it was a ‘place of safety’, so when the attack happened it was ‘more of a surprise’.

Mr Chilcott added: ‘They did what they had to do, which was go into the safe areas and locked themselves in.

‘One
of our staff was on his own and he barricaded the door with a heavy 
safe and a bed and braced himself against the wall. And for 45 minutes 
he could hear people bashing down the door, smashing the windows and 
trying to get in because they knew he was there.

‘It must have been a very frightening experience – until eventually the door gave way and they got him.

‘It must have been a troubling experience. They were quite roughly handled.’ The staff were later released.

Asked if it had occurred to him that he might suffer the same fate as 52 Americans held hostage for 444 days by hardline students at the U.S. Embassy in Iran from 1979, Chilcott said: ‘It would be untrue to say that those thoughts don’t go through your mind, of course, and you hope that that is not going to happen.’

Mr Chilcott, who was appointed to the role in October, added: ‘Iran is not the sort of country where spontaneously a demonstration congregates then attacks a foreign embassy. That sort of activity is only done with the support of the state.’

The last Iranian diplomats left the UK yesterday as David Cameron, the Prime Minister, again condemned the 'appalling' attack on the UK's Tehran embassy that sparked their expulsion.

The London embassy of the Islamic republic was being emptied by removal men as a 2pm deadline for staff to leave the country approached.

As removal workers loaded luggage on to vehicles outside the embassy , a group of 20 protesters shouted anti-regime slogans such as 'terrorists, terrorists; must go, must go'.

Many were members of the London Green

campaigns on the country's human rights issues.

Following
Tuesday's attack on the British embassy, the Foreign Secretary had 
announced that all Iranian diplomats had 48 hours to close the embassy 
and vacate British soil.

He also ordered the evacuation of around 24 British embassy staff from the Iranian capital.

The
incident, described by Mr Hague as 'outrageous and indefensible', came 
after Britain's decision to impose further sanctions on Iran over its 
nuclear programme.

The 
latest developments were discussed by the Prime Minister during talks in
Paris, where he thanked President Nicolas Sarkozy for his country's 
help.

France was one of 
several European nations to withdraw ambassadors from Tehran in reaction
to the looting of the building, which was widely condemned 
internationally.

'It was an 
opportunity to discuss the appalling events in Tehran and for me to 
thank President Sarkozy for the help the French gave to our staff and 
our embassy,' Mr Cameron said.

At
talks with fellow EU foreign ministers in Brussels yesterday, Mr Hague 
welcomed what he described as 'a great deal of solidarity' from other EU
capitals over the incident, with many countries withdrawing their 
ambassadors from Iran in protest.

But
he said another round of sanctions designed to further isolate the 
regime was a separate issue already on the EU agenda and was not 
prompted by the disorder.

The
new sanctions include adding 180 individuals and Iranian businesses 
associated with the Iran regime to a list of those banned from travel in
Europe and whose European assets are frozen.

Mr Hague said further work on economic sanctions would continue towards a possible ban on Iranian oil exports to the EU.

'There
will be further measures against Iran unless Iran changes its behaviour
and the course of its (nuclear) policies,' he added.

Mr
Hague said the UK was pleased with the outcome, but it was not the end 
of the issue - further measures to be discussed next month would be 
designed to 'severely affect the Iranian financial system and the energy
and transport sectors'.

Meanwhile,
he said, the determination of the EU had been demonstrated again: 'I 
think the Iranian regime should hear that loud and clear from this 
meeting in Brussels.'

Earlier,
Mr Hague repeated his thanks for the support of member states, 
including Germany, France and the Netherlands which have withdrawn their
ambassadors from Iran following the attack on the UK embassy.

He
said the long-term concern was with the Iranian nuclear programme, and 
the danger it posed to Middle East peace and the threat of proliferation
spreading to other countries in the region.

EU
foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said: 'The Council (of foreign 
ministers) is outraged by the attack on the British embassy in Tehran, 
and deplore the decision to expel the British ambassador.

'These actions against the UK are against the European Union as a whole.
