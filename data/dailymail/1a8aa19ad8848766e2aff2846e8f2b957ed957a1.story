This may not have been enough to persuade the Crystal Palace powerbrokers to hand Keith Millen the manager’s job on a full-time basis.

But the coach, taking caretaker charge of Palace for the third time, did his chances no harm as the South London club collected a hard-earned point away at Queens Park Rangers.

It wasn’t pretty; not that Millen will care.

It’s clear Palace’s players are behind Millen; as they mustered a gutsy performance at Loftus Road as if to say: ‘Millen’s our man’.

In confirming he wants to be considered for top job, Millen said: ‘I’m ready for it, yes.

‘The players respect me. I’ve done it enough times. Now the chairman will decide whether he needs more experience and what names are available. It’s a big decision because it’s a vital time now.

‘I’ve not been told I’ve got a chance, I’ve not spoken to the chairman in regard to myself.

‘It’s not a conversation to have on the day of the game, so I’m sure I’ll speak to him tomorrow.

‘I’ve worked with them for two years. I know what makes them tick and what bring the best out of them. So it will be down to the chairman to make that decision.’

Harry Redknapp, however, won’t be quite as positive as QPR toiled against a Palace side whose confidence levels were at rock-bottom following the dismal few weeks of Warnock’s reign.

On his big chance to impress Parish – who was sat next to close confidant Mark Bright – Millen’s first big call was to employ winger Wilfried Zaha as a lone centre-forward in an attempt to breathe life into Palace’s misfiring frontline.

And Millen would have been satisfied with his side’s opening 45 minutes, restricting Rangers to one long-range Charlie Austin effort that was comfortably saved by Julian Speroni.

Warnock’s dismissal prevented the veteran manager from returning to QPR – the club he led to the Premier League in 2011 – , but the home supporters were intent on acknowledge their ex-boss as they broke into cries of: ‘There’s only one Neil Warnock,’ in the 21st minute.

Their good nature would have diminished just a minute later if Jason Puncheon’s curling effort from the edge of the area hadn’t hit Robert Green’s far post.

The effort was the highlight of a drab opening 45 minutes; the encounter having little to offer in terms entertainment value – though the half-time marriage proposal between two Rangers fans on the pitch helped lift spirits following the woeful first period. 

The female supporter was in tears as she accepted her new fiance’s hand in marriage; maybe she was despairing at the prospect of another dire 45 minutes.

And the second half started much like the first: big on work-rate but little in the way of quality.

It’s probably the reason why both sides are looking worryingly at the Premier League table going into 2015.

Leroy Fer went close in the 59th minute, forcing Julian Speroni into an excellent save before the encounter finally sparked into life.

Green tipped over another curling effort from Puncheon in the 66th minute before Steven Caulker, who was target for Palace in the summer, thought he made the breakthrough 15 minutes from time, rising above Damien Delaney to thump a header from Joey Barton’s corner past Speroni only for James McArthur to produce a brilliant goal line clearance.

And the visitors came desperately close to claiming victory with virtually the last kick of the game as Green saved Puncheon’s low drive from 13 yards before Palace were denied a penalty as Fraizer Campbell fell in the ensuing melee.
