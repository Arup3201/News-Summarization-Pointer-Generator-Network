The tinsel is still on the Christmas tree and there are plenty of mince pies to be eaten, yet some high street stores have started selling Easter treats.

Hollow chocolate bunnies, ‘Malt-easter’ packs and Easter-themed Cadbury creme eggs are on the shelves of the likes of Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Asda.

The nation has barely got over celebrating the birth of Jesus, while Easter, where Christians remember the crucifixion and resurrection, does not fall until April 20.

Happy Easter! Supermarkets have filled their shelves with eggs, including this Waitrose in Berkshire, four months before the main event

Trend: The early availability of Easter chocolate is part of a wider pattern that has seen shops stocking Christmas food and other products ever earlier each year

Yet retailers, who rely on Easter as one of the biggest trigger points of the year for confectionery sales, are suggesting people can buy their eggs now.

In reality people are being encouraged to stock up for Easter despite the fact that both Valentine’s Day and Mothering Sunday are still a long way off.

The early availability of Easter chocolate is part of a wider pattern that has seen shops stocking Christmas food and other products ever earlier each year.

Products like mince pies, chocolate logs and other festive food are now available so early in some stores that they are well past their sell-by date on December 25.

Backlash: The decision to put Easter egg products on shelves has triggered a backlash from shoppers on Twitter and other sites. Above, Tina Blake condemns Waitrose's decision to sell Easter eggs already

The decision to put Easter egg products on shelves has triggered a backlash from shoppers on Twitter and other social network sites.

The Waitrose at the Membury Services on the M4 is offering an Easter collection which includes ‘Malt-Easters’, Cadbury Crème Eggs and the new Cadbury ‘Egg n Spoon’ packs.

One Twitter user commented: ‘Sad really. We’ve barely got his birth out of the way and we’re already preparing to celebrate his death.’

Another wrote: ‘So not surprised... Merry Easter!’ 

On seeing Easter eggs on display at another Waitrose, Tina Blake took to Twitter to complain, writing: ‘OMG @waitrose you disappoint me easter eggs already #why #april20th’.

The firm responded via its own Twitter feed saying: ‘Hi, I’m sorry you felt this to be too early and will pass on your comments for discussion at our next review meeting. Thanks.’ 

Sarah Batten was also unhappy using the social networking site to say: ‘There are Easter eggs in Waitrose next to the half-price Christmas puddings. Losing my faith in humanity.’ 

However, Waitrose is not alone. An Instagram picture from an identified Marks & Spencer store, showed white and milk chocolate Easter Bunnies, in what one shopper described as ‘ludicrous’.

Asda was also selling piles of Cadbury Crème Eggs in displays marked ‘Only until Easter’, which happens to be some 16 weeks away.

Waitrose defended its policy, saying: ‘Our main Easter egg fixtures don’t go into our branches until later in January. 

‘However, where branches have surplus space, they may decide to put a selection of chocolate eggs out before then.

'This isn’t any different to what’s happened in previous years and we’re very sorry if any of our customers are upset.’ 

M&S said: ‘We’ve a very small selection of Easter themed chocolates such as mini chocolate eggs and bunnies in stores as we know that some of our customers like to buy these early. Our full Easter range won’t go into stores until after Mother’s Day in March.’
