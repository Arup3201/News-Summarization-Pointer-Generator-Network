‘I will be a fan of Atletico all my life for what they have given me this year.’

Villa
 moved to Atletico from Barcelona ahead of last season and, leading the 
attack alongside Diego Costa, helped them win a first La Liga title 
since 1996.

They also came 
within 90 seconds of winning the Champions League before Real Madrid 
rallied to claim the title 4-1 after extra time in last week's final in 
Lisbon.

‘It has been a great
 project for me both personally as well as sporting and now I face a new
 challenge which is what I have always looked to do in my career and my 
life,’ he added.

Confirmed: Villa has been named in the final 23-man squad for Spain's World Cup defence

‘I would 
like to thank the people at Atletico and those that tried to convince me
 to stay, like Cholo (coach Diego Simeone) and the rest of the coaching 
staff.’

Villa was named in 
Spain's 23-man squad for the World Cup in Brazil, where the defending 
champions will open their Group B campaign against the Netherlands in 
Salvador on June 13 before facing Chile and Australia.
