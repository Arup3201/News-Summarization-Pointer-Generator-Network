The photographer who was killed while taking pictures of Justin Bieber on New Year's Day 'stalked and harassed' the star, 'following and chasing him at every opportunity', it has been claimed.

Sources close to Bieber are reported as saying photographer Chris Guerra had also falsely accused the teen idol of smoking pot in his Ferrari.

They claim Guerra, 29, lied when he told a friend he saw Bieber smoking pot from a pipe while out driving his white Ferrari earlier on the day he died.

Tragic: Freelance photographer Chris Guerra died after being knocked over in LA while tailing Justin Bieber

Horrific: The photographer was struck by another car as he was running back to his own vehicle after taking pictures of the star's car. This picture shows the man's hat and shoe lying in the road where he was hit

Chris Guerra, a freelance photographer, was tailing Bieber’s white $200,000 458 Italia Ferrari  when it was pulled over by California Highway Patrol officers in Los Angeles on Tuesday night. 

Guerra got out of his car to take pictures but was
struck by a Toyota Highlander SUV as he was running back to his own 
vehicle after being told to return to his vehicle repeatedly by police.

According to celebrity website TMZ, 
the Bieber source said there are multiple witnesses to say the 
only time Justin left the Four Seasons hotel on New Year's Day was to go
to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Hollywood for lunch.

Mr Guerra is also said to have told a friend he saw a car belonging to Selena Gomez at the Four Seasons.

But the Bieber source claims this was
another lie and that Gomez and Bieber had argued on December 30 after 
flying out to Mexico for New Year's Eve and had subsequently split up

According to TMZ, Guerra claimed to 
friends earlier in the day that he had spotted Bieber smoking what he 
believed to be marijuana from a pipe while driving the Ferrari.

A source said the photographer told him he was following the singer back to his base at the Four 
Seasons and was continuing to pursue what he believed was a big story.

The
source says after 20 minutes, Guerra hung up as he said the Ferrari was 
pulling out of the hotel parking lot and he needed to hang up and follow
it. Apparently he had no idea Bieber wasn't actually in the car, which was being driven by the star's friend, 19-year-old rapper Lil Twist.

A spokesperson for Bieber told Mailonline: ‘It’s really sad that people are trying to push a story with no facts so soon after this tragic accident. Justin was not present or involved in this incident and the focus should remain on honoring the memory of the victim.’

Bieber had already been pulled over 
by police in his Ferrari while driving through West Hollywood in 
November. He was initially pulled over for making an unsafe left turn. 
During the stop, the officer discovered Bieber's registration was 
expired and he was given a ticket.

Bieber had helped ring in the new year, performing on 'Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve' on Monday night.

Memorials: Flowers and a hand-made cross were left by the roadside on Wednesday following Chris Guerra's death

Justin Bieber has called for new laws for paparazzi following the 'tragic' death of the photographer.

The 18-year-old released a statement on Wednesday: 'While I was not present nor directly 
involved with this tragic accident, my thoughts and prayers are with the
family of the victim.'

'Hopefully this tragedy will finally 
inspire meaningful legislation and whatever other necessary steps to 
protect the lives and safety of celebrities, police officers, innocent 
public bystanders, and the photographers themselves.'

Photographs taken from the scene show Guerra's hat and shoe lying in the road where he was hit. He was wearing the same baseball cap on one of the last time he was photographed last month in Aspen, Colorado.

The female driver of the car which struck the photographer is believed to have stopped other cars from hitting the man's body after she had called 911.

No charges are likely to be filed against the motorist - believed to be female - who hit the man.

The
LAPD is continuing to investigate the man’s death. A representative for
the department did not immediately return MailOnline's request for 
comment.

Guerra was a freelance photographer who submitted pictures to AKI images/GSI Media for syndication, the company confirmed today.

Los
Angeles police officer Sergeant Rudy Lopez said the highway patrol men 
had noticed the photographer taking pictures close to the scene. He said
one of the officers asked him to return to his vehicle.

Sgt Lopez said: 'He verbally ordered 
him to return to the vehicle, he had to order him twice and he seemed 
reluctant to go back, but eventually he did.

'When
the photographer returned to the vehicle it did not appear that he was 
looking and he was struck by a vehicle traveling southbound.'

Guerra died at a hospital shortly after the crash.

The
sports car - which contained two of Bieber's friends, with rapper Lil 
Twist believed to be behind the wheel - was parked on the side of 
Sepulveda Boulevard near Getty 
Center Drive after the traffic stop.

According
to sources, Lil Twist - real name Christopher Moore - was with Bieber 
at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills on Tuesday afternoon when he left 
in the white Ferrari without Justin.

Twist, who is a Lil Wayne protege, and Bieber have been hanging out and partying together for the past few weeks.

They even celebrated New Year's Eve together by popping champagne bottles in Mexico, where they're both of legal drinking age.

Anti-paparazzi: Miley Cyrus vented her anger over the tragic accident in Los Angeles

Reacting to the accident, Miley Cyrus took to Twitter to call the paparazzi 'fools'.

The Disney star, 20, tweeted: 'Hope this paparazzi/JB accident brings on some changes in '13 Paparazzi are dangerous! Wasn't Princess Di enough of a wake up call?!

'It is unfair for anyone to put this on to Justin's conscious as well! This was bound to happen! Your mom teaches u when your a child not to play in the street!

'The chaos that comes with the paparazzi acting like fools makes it impossible for anyone to make safe choices.'

Bieber has had a grueling couple of months. Only last month, a gruesome plot to murder the Canadian crooner was revealed.

Trouble: Justin Bieber was pulled over in his Ferarri by cops in West Hollywood in November and given a ticket

Mark Staake and his nephew, Tanner Ruane, were allegedly plotting to kidnap, torture, and kill the singer while he was in New York to perform at Madison Square Garden.

The alleged mastermind behind the plot, Dane Martin had ordered for ‘the murder and castration’ of the 18-year-old singer.

And in November, the ‘Baby’ singer had a run-in with a paparazzo who claimed Bieber was driving too fast. ‘What do your parents think about what you do? Do you tell them, “I stalk people for a living”?’ the singer asked.

The incident held up traffic in Hollywood. Before speeding off, Bieber said, ‘You guys love this, don’t you?’
