Any day now he is due to become a father for the first time.

But that did not deter Prince William from competing in charity polo match today - almost 100 miles from where his wife will give birth in London.

Heavily pregnant Kate, 31, let slip earlier this year that the eagerly-anticipated royal baby was due in mid July.

Despite this, William left her side 
today to play in the Jerudong Trophy, at Cirencester Park Polo Club, in 
Gloucestershire, where he competed on the same team as his brother 
Harry, 28, in an annual event to raise money for good causes including 
youth homelessness charity Centrepoint, of which the Duke is a patron.

Search and rescue pilot William, 31, 
displayed his excellent horsemanship skills at the Cotswold's club but 
his team Cirencester Purple, lost 7 goals to 51/2 against Cirencester 
Black.

Before the match, the tanned and 
relaxed looking father-to-be seemed to be getting some practice when he 
was seen cooing over a friend's baby girl.

In recent weeks there has been 
increasing speculation that the public had been misled and the new third
 in line to the throne was due earlier, although this has been 
vehemently denied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's spokesman.

Prince William and Prince Harry, who looked as though they had caught the sun, took a quick break for a catch-up

Palace sources said that the Prince had changed his mind several times as to whether he would compete in Sunday's match.

‘Initially his office said yes, then said no, and have now confirmed that he will be playing,’ the source said.

Overdue: The Duchess of Cambridge's due date came and went yesterday

‘I think he was torn as, clearly, he 
wants to be with his wife at such an important time, but was all too 
aware how much the event raises for charities he is passionate about.’

It is understood that if he had 
received a call from Kate to say the baby was on its way, he would 
receive a police escort back to London, meaning he could make the 
94-mile trip in just over an hour.

The match was the second time the 
Prince played polo over the weekend, travelling 60 miles on Saturday - 
Kate's reported due date - to compete in a charity match in Kent.

The Duchess is currently dividing her
 time between their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where 
she is busy making final preparations for her baby's birth as well as 
overseeing the redecoration of their new 20-room apartment in the main 
building, and her parents' mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

She is due to give birth in a private
 suite at St Mary's Hospital, in Paddington, west London, the same wing 
where Princess Diana gave birth to William and Harry.

Other charities which benefited from 
yesterday's match include Child Bereavement UK, which supports families 
when a child dies or when a child is bereaved.

They will also be supporting WellChild, another charity of which Harry is patron.

Desperate to be a ‘hands-on’ dad, 
William has made clear he is determined to make his son or daughter’s 
birth ‘by hook or by crook’ and is now on leave from the RAF.

The Mail has revealed that he even 
had a helicopter on stand-by in the garden of his Welsh farmhouse in 
case Kate’s waters broke while he on duty.

William’s father, Prince Charles, broke royal tradition when he was present at the birth of both his sons.

Prince Philip, however, played squash
 with his friend and private secretary, Michael Parker, while the Queen –
 then Princess Elizabeth - was in labour with Prince Charles, although 
he took her champagne and carnations when it was all over.
