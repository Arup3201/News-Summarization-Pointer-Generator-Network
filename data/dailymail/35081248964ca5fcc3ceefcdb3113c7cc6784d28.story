Scarlett Johansson looked fashion forward and super cool in her Spring 2015 Preen by Thornton Bregazzi little black dress.

Her take on the closet classic had a surprising twist with a beaded fringe that felt like a flapper girl's dream. The fringe detail gave the dress movement, making Scarlett's sheath seem fun and effervescent.

The actress kept the focus on her bold choice of apparel by keeping the rest of her styling to a minimum. She paired her Preen dress with some simple black pumps and stayed jewelry and accessory free.

Her swept back pompadour-inspired hair mimicked her youthful and effortless elegance. The overall effect was decidedly grown up and dressy, but with a laid back insouciant vibe.

Scarlett's time spent living in Pairs is clearly rubbing off on her sense of style, shifting her aesthetic towards a more sophisticated, yet whimsical taste.

Her Preen dress is not yet available in stores, but it will come with an equally A-list price tag. Considering what a big trend fringe was on the Spring runways, finding an alternate take on this dress should come easily. Take a look through our picks from Mara Hoffman, Milly, Forever 21 and Kate Spade below.

Scarlett says it can be difficult 'trying to find time to go to the gym'. But once she's there, the 30-year-old buckles down.

'I do the same fitness routine as my big muscle-man trainer,' she says. 'A lot of it is endurance, stability and strength training.

'I like to work up a sweat. I've tried Pilates and yoga and all that, and I like to dabble in different things. But I always come back to a good old-fashioned athletic, full-body workout.' 

What to try: The knee drive with weights. 

Stand with a dumbbell or bottle of water in each hand, palms facing inwards. Make sure your feet are positioned underneath your hipbones and are facing forwards. Putting your weight on your left leg, bring your right knee up to chest level.

Swing the right leg back behind the body into a lunge position, placing the foot on the floor. Then immediately drive the knee forward to chest level again. Keep the weights at your sides as you do this. Repeat 12 to 15 times before switching sides.
