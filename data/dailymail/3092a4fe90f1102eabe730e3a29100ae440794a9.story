An easyJet plane sparked panic on the ground after it was  spotted circling in the sky above Liverpool airport for two hours with an RAF jet in tow on Tuesday.

The budget airline's Airbus A-319 was seen by observers who took to Twitter to highlight its unusual flight pattern - and fears were raised when a Hawk was seen flying a similar route.

However, a spokesman for John Lennon Airport confirmed the two aircraft were both taking part in training exercises on the same day.

Members of the public began to worry when an RAF Hawk jet was also spotted circling the airspace

'We had a crew training flights that departed from John Lennon Airport, which will have gone up, come down, gone up and come down again,' the spokesman told Mail Online.

'It's not unusual and we have these very often in fact there was one that has been out today (Tuesday).

'Because of the wind direction, the flights went out on a slightly different path, which was more over south Liverpool, and this meant that more people noticed it.

'And then purely by coincidence, an RAF Hawk was out on a training exercise and was in the same area. People were putting two and two together and getting five.' 

A member of public, Karl Voice, also contacted the Wirral Globe after he saw the easyJet plane performing 'evasive manoeuvres' with its landing gear down over New Ferry from about 11.30am.' 

Locals took to Twitter after seeing both planes in the sky for up to two hours.

The circling of the easyJet plane began to stir up questioning on Twitter

While Ciara wrote: 'There's been an easyJet plane and a RAF fighter circling Liverpool all day and it kept flying right over our school like so low it was crazy.'

Eileen posted: 'That easyJet plane is still flying round and round in circles! That's one long training course they're on! #Liverpool.'

A spokesman for easyJet said: 'easyJet has been conducting routine crew training flights in the North West which are set to continue for the rest of the week.

Officials at John Lennon Airport have said that the plane will be 'in training' for a few days

'Our pilots are always fully aware of other aircraft operating safely in the vicinity. At no point was there any risk whatsoever to either aircraft.

'The airline has a comprehensive training programme for its pilots and as part of this conducts numerous flights of this kind every year.'

However, members of the public seemed to believe this was far less 'normal' than suggested.

Writing on Twitter Peter Handley said: 'Anyone know why the plane is circling? Counted at least 15 times in the past 2 hours.

And Kieran Hughes was similarly confused, writing: 'Sat for about 4 hours watching an easyjet plane circle Liverpool airport!'

Keith Stafford added: 'The plane circling Airport is crew training. Seems too unusual still.'
