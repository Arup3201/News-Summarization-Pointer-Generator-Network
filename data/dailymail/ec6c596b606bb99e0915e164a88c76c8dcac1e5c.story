Who likes short shorts?

Well it seems Today show host Karl Stefanovic does, as he appeared on the breakfast show this morning bearing his pins in a pair of tiny black shorts.

The 40-year-old gold Logie winner, who was taking part in a segment on how to be a good morning person, is known for being one of Australia's biggest jokers and he certainly got into the spirit of the exercise routines, displaying his sporty physique in a range of questionable poses.

The loveable rogue, who was joined on set by co-host Lisa Wilkinson and fitness instructor Michael Ryan, turned all of Australia into morning people this morning, keeping them entertained as he twisted and stretched in his hotpants.

Lisa Wilkinson could barely contain herself as she laughed through the opening half of the segment, claiming she didn't know why all the floor staff were in stitches.

As the fitness trainer demonstrated the best exercises for a healthy morning routine, Karl, who was wearing a pair of Birkenstocks with socks, stretched out his legs. apparently not too concerned about his tiny shorts showing off too much skin.

The joker got some strange looks from co-host Laura Wilkinson and trainer Michael Ryan regarding his Birkenstocks, which he teamed with a pair of black socks

During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background.

Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire. 

'That's not pretty, I think we should stand up guys because it's not good TV at this point in time,' the fitness guru said.  

'He's like a dog about to walk up on a tree.'

Karl did little to protect his modesty during the exercise segment 

The trainer looked on in confusion as Karl spread his legs in his tiny hotpants 

However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display.

'What? If you don't like it look away,' he jokingly said.

That's when things took an unsightly turn, as the trainer introduced the lateral lunge. 

There was no escaping this move for Karl and he conceded to defeat as he put his hands down to cover his modesty.

Twitter users loved Karl's exercise routine, with one commenter claiming she his workout made her want to workout all day long. 

Another user commented on Karl's disposition during the whole segment, claiming he demonstrated the Australian version of blue steel.

In November, the Today show co-host shocked viewers when he revealed that he had been wearing the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air for a year, to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry.

Stefanovic said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked.  

'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' he told Fairfax Media.

'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them.

'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test).'

Stefanovic's experiment  sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post.

Karl, whose funny streak has seen him become one of the biggest names on television, admitted on Wednesday that he once got into some trouble on the Gold Coast.

Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson, he was asked if he'd ever been in trouble with the law.

'Yeah I got locked up on the Gold Coast once,' he replied, with a shocked Jackie quickly asking what he'd done to land himself in jail. 

'I was at Billy’s nightclub…and I went out to the foyer, and there was a big life size poster of [Australian sportsman and former ironman] Trevor Hendy – and I thought it would be a good idea to take that off the wall and run outside with it.' 

Karl explained where it all went wrong and said: 'Well I was so drunk I ran all the way around the block to the waiting police!.'
