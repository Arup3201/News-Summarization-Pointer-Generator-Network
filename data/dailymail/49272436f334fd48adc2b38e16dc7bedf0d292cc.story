The parents of the Duchess of Cambridge are among hundreds of residents affected by 1,000 ton manure fire.

Householders in the Berkshire village of Bucklebury, where Michael and Carole Middleton have just bought a £4.85million Georgian mansion, have been warned to stay indoors after a huge mound of agricultural fertiliser, the size of a football field, spontaneously combusted.

Firefighters have been unable to put out the flames, meaning the fire will have to burn itself out – which could take up to month.

Villagers have been told to stay inside, keep windows closed and protect themselves from fumes which could cause irritation to airways, skin and eyes.

Anyone suffering breathlessness or chest pain has been told to seek immediate medical advice, however.

The situation is all the more worrying as Kate, who is pregnant with her first child, has been staying with her parents since last weekend.

She was seen out shopping in her local Waitrose only a few days ago while he husband is back in North Wales, where he works as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot.

The couple also spent Christmas Day with the Middleton family before driving up to Sandringham to join the Royal Family for their traditional celebrations in Norfolk.

The blaze started back in November when the manure, which is on land owned by waste management firm Grundon and leased to recycling firm Good2Grow Recycling, spontaneously combusted, causing fumes to drift as far as Thatcham, four miles away.

Some 25 villagers are believed to have complained to the Environment Agency and West Berkshire Council over the acrid smoke.

A spokesman for Grundon said: 'Following guidance and advice from the emergency services, we have been creating fire breaks to try to separate the material currently alight from the other green waste materials on the site.

'We will continue to monitor the site and offer the fire brigade whatever support we can in terms of both equipment and manpower, until everything is fully extinguished.

'In the meantime, the Environment Agency is continuing with its efforts to contact the facility operators Good2Grow.'

Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue said it would take at least two-to-four weeks to burn out.
