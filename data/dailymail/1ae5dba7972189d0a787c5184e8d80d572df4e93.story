A teenager, accused of stabbing his grandmother 93 times and shooting her in the head with a crossbow, allegedly told his father that he 'blacked out'.

Jasper Aristotle Smiddie,19, had initially 
plotted to kill his uncle, but instead decided to make him live with the
death of his mother, 67-year-old Gloria Helfrich, authorities have alleged.

After attacking his grandmother in her bedroom at the home they shared in Lake Wales, Florida, the teen called his father and said that he had 'gotten into some problems' and 'did something stupid,' investigators allege.
