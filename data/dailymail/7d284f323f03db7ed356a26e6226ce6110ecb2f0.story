American billionaire William Koch has been told he cannot sue an auction house over his purchase of Â£300,000 of counterfeit wine - because he waited too long to file his case.

Koch, brother of businessmen and 
conservative political activists Charles and David, had accused 
Christie's of rubber stamping as authentic a cache of wine said to have 
been owned by the third U.S. president Thomas Jefferson, while knowing it was worthless 
plonk.

However, his claims died on the vine after a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled he had waited too long to file his lawsuit against the auction house.

Koch, the founder of Oxbow Group energy company, failed to conduct timely due diligence when doubts were first raised about the wine's authenticity, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found.

The billionaire bought four bottles of red wine in 1987 and 1988 that was said to be from 1787 and with the letters 'Th.J.' etched in the glass. Jefferson was a wine aficionado and served as an envoy to France in the late 18th century. The wines at issue were purported to have been discovered in Paris.

But starting in 2000, reports surfaced that cast doubt on the origin of the bottles, clues that 'would suggest to a reasonably intelligent person that the wine was not authentic', the appeals court wrote.

Yet Koch waited until 2005 to begin his investigation into the wine's origin, the court said. Koch's claim, the court concluded, 'is therefore time-barred'.

Koch purchased the wine from dealer Hardy Rodenstock through intermediaries. In his lawsuit, filed in 2010, Koch contended that Rodenstock and the long-time head of Christie's wine department, Michael Broadbent, were associates in the purported fraud.

Koch, whose worth is about $4billion according to Forbes magazine, said Christie's had agreed to promote Rodenstock's reputation and sell his wines. His lawsuit also said Christie's had lobbied Monticello, Jefferson's Virginia home, to vouch for the wine.

The appeals court ruling upheld the dismissal of the case by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones.

Maura Grinalds, a lawyer for Christie's, did not immediately return a call for comment on the ruling.

Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for Koch, repeated the wine collector's allegation that the auction house conspired to sell fake wine.

Goldstein said: 'They got away with it. They escaped on a technicality and their behavior warrants closer scrutiny.'

Meanwhile, Koch has been pursuing a lawsuit against Rodenstock. In May, a magistrate judge recommended that Rodenstock be fined over $600,000 in damages. Judge Jones, who is overseeing this case, has yet to decide whether to adopt the magistrate's findings.

A Christie's spokesman said the auction house was 'pleased' by the ruling.
