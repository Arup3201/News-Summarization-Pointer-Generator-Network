Police are investigating claims that Viscount Tonypandy, seen here in his role as Commons Speaker, raped a 9-year-old boy

Police are investigating claims that the late peer Viscount Tonypandy raped a boy, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission is looking into what took them so long to launch an inquiry.

The alleged victim, now believed to be 55-years-old, claims he was abused in his Cardiff home in the late-1960s and early-1970s by the politician, then still known as George Thomas and was a Labour MP before his elevation to the peerage as a cross-bencher.

The former Speaker, who died in 1997, was friends with the alleged victim's Labour Party supporting foster parents.

The man, who now lives in Australia, alleged abuse was also carried out at another address in the city.

He has twice complained to South Wales police about the alleged incidents. 

Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Holland said: 'We were made aware of these ­allegations in April 2013 and have attempted to get in touch with the victim. Unfortunately incorrect contact information was used. As a result we failed to make contact.

'We have since spoken to the victim, apologised for the delay and are investigating his claims. This delay was unacceptable and we have referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.'

She added: 'It is important that victims have the confidence to come forward and speak to us.

'We take any allegations regarding sexual assault or rape extremely seriously and urge anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to make contact with us.'

The investigation comes as the Government looks into claims the Establishment covered up an alleged paedophilia ring for decades.

In the 1960s Viscount Tonypandy, seen here at his Cardiff home, was  a Minister in the Home Office, which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases

When the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens tried to expose public figures he claimed were involved in a Westminster child sex ring in the 1980s, Viscount Tonypandy, who was in the Speaker’s chair at the time, had himself been blackmailed over his homosexuality.

There have also been claims that he tried to proposition young men in the Speaker’s official grace and favour apartment in Parliament.

In the 1960s, he was a Minister in the Home Office, which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases, including Dickens’s dossier in the 1980s.

Viscount Tonypandy was one of Britain’s best-loved and most influential public figures as Speaker from 1976 to 1983.
