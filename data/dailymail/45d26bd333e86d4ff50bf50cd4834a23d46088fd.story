An 18-year-old from Michigan who faked her own disappearance and even put an ad on Craigslist to find an abductor has been placed on probation for three years.

Hayley Turner of Temperance didn't speak in Monroe County Circuit Court on Thursday. She must perform 29 days of community service and pay $15,200 to the sheriff's office for the 17-hour search.

Turner pleaded guilty to causing a false police report to be filed.

She claimed to have been abducted at gunpoint on August 7 in Bedford Township, just north of the Ohio-Michigan border. She was found safe with a puppy, 16 hours later in Ecorse, near Detroit.

Sentenced: Hayely Turner, seen here at sentencing Thursday, faked her own abduction and has been sentenced to three years probation and is responsible for the $15,200 her manhunt cost authorities

The 18-year-old girl whose disappearance sparked a large-scale manhunt was charged with falsifying a police report.

Detectives claim Turner's story that she was held and assaulted for 16 hours in Monroe County, Michigan, last month unravelled during questioning.

She was found 45 miles from her home in Bedford Township with slashes across her thighs after a multi-agency search involving helicopters, police dogs and multiple forces.

But FBI agents drafted in to tackle the case concluded there were significant gaps in her account - and even insist the cuts on her thighs were self-inflicted to back up her story.

Appearing at Monroe County District Court, Turner pleaded not guilty to the charge of filing a false police report.

The charge, a felony, was punishable by up to four years in prison and a fine of up to $2,000. 

Probation: Seen here when first charged in September, Hayley Turner eventually pleaded guilty to filing a false police report after detectives claimed her story unravelled during questioning and even the cuts on her thighs appear to have been self-inflicted

Faced jail: The 18-year-old could have been sentenced to four years in jail if found guilty of filing a false police report

Prosecutor William Nichols said: 'If convicted, the court may also order the defendant to reimburse the local unit of government for expenses incurred in the emergency response, police investigation and prosecution of the defendant.'

Police claim Turner told her family she was going to a video store in Bedford Township, Monroe County, before her disappearance on August 6.

She was then speaking to a friend on the phone  when she said she was stopping to help someone by the side of a road, the sheriff's department said.

After a few minutes, Turner told her friend that she was being followed by a man with a gun. 

Then the call was disconnected.

Police were notified, sparking a multi-agency manhunt involving dogs, helicopters and a number of police departments.

Her parents even spoke at a press conference and made a tearful appeal for her to come home. 

Turner's mother Christy Turner spoke at the conference, saying 'Hayley, please call. Call anybody. We miss you. We want you home.' 

When Turner was found 16 hours later about 45 miles from that spot in Ecorse, a suburb of Detroit, she told officials she had been abducted.

However, initial questioning appeared to reveal gaps in her story. 

A Monroe sheriff's detective and an FBI agent re-interviewed Turner days later, while a team consulted phone records, computer records and other witnesses.

Eventually, they appealed to the prosecutor to level charges against Turner. 

'As a result of that interview, it was determined that the incident did not take place, as originally reported,' the sheriff's department said in a statement. It said the sheriff's department forwarded its report to prosecutors in Monroe County.
