Cameroon's football federation is to investigate allegations of match-fixing by its players at the World Cup after it emerged a convicted fraudster correctly predicted they'd lose 4-0 and have a man sent off against Croatia.

The governing body (FECAFOOT) released a statement confirming that their ethics committee will probe claims of 'fraud' by 'seven bad apples' in the country's three Group A matches, particularly the Croatia defeat on June 18 in Manaus.

Allegations were made in a German news magazine Der Spiegel by convicted match fixer Wilson Raj Perumal from Singapore.

The FECAFOOT statement read: 'Recent allegations of fraud around Cameroon 2014 FIFA World Cup three preliminary games, especially Cameroon vs. Croatia, as well of the "existence of seven bad apples [in our national team]" do not reflect the values and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of Conduct and the ethics of our nation.

'We wish to inform the general public that, though not yet contacted by FIFA in regards to this affair, our administration has already instructed its Ethics Committee, to further investigate these accusations.

'We are strongly committed to employ all means necessary to resolve this disruptive matter in the shortest delays.

'In the meantime we legitimately request that any related information, unless brought before our federation and/or its Ethics Committee, be held for or treated as mere assumption.

'We wish to reinstate that in fifty-five (55) years of existence, FECAFOOT has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind.'

Rout: Cameroon imploded against Croatia in Manaus and fell to a 4-0 defeat

Cameroon and Barcelona midfielder Alex
 Song was sent off before half-time for elbowing Croatia's Mario 
Mandzukic, while the game was also marred by an incident deep into the 
second half as Benoit Assou-Ekotto looked like he tried to head-butt 
team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo.

FECAFOOT
 subsequently launched an investigation into the incident but have not 
yet reported the outcome of that investigation. Cameroon headed home 
after losing against Brazil and Mexico, as well as Croatia, to finish 
bottom of Group A.

Ghana and
 Nigeria, who have also exited the tournament, were involved in disputes
 over money in Brazil in what has been a troubled World Cup for African 
nations.

Ghana sent two 
players home - Sulley Muntari for hitting out at an official and 
Kevin-Prince Boateng for allegedly swearing at his coach.

Meanwhile,
 the International Centre for Sport Security (ICSS) have challenged 
allegations of match-fixing made towards the seven Cameroon players.

ICSS
 director Chris Eaton, also FIFA’s former head of security, has 
questioned Perumal’s version of events, revealing his belief that the 
49-year-old has not always proved reliable. He added that legal advice 
has indicated that ‘there was no observable suspicious betting on this 
match’.

Eaton
 said: ‘If it is confirmed that the advice from Perumal was made before 
the match and is accurate to the overall result and red card, then this 
allegation will no doubt be treated extremely seriously by football, 
governments and beyond.  I understand that he has made other 
‘predictions’ during this competition that have not proved accurate.

‘As
 part of the ICSS’s international work in the area of sport integrity 
and work alongside betting regulators, operators and monitoring 
agencies, the advice we have received from the legal or so-called 
‘regulated’ sport betting industry is that there was “no observable 
suspicious betting on this match”.

‘Looking at recent reports, it is my view that Perumal is himself playing a game.  His selective and even the dramatic timing in his exposure of information over time suggests that he has never completely revealed what he knows and which criminal organisations he maintains contact with.

'At the same time, Wilson Raj Perumal is portrayed as someone who is assisting police and prosecutors in Europe.  With the benefit of hindsight, a concerted international and multi-agency debriefing of Perumal when he was first taken into custody in Finland should have been the focus.’ 

However, Eaton added that the case would be thoroughly investigated: ‘The Cameroon match-fixing case is a grave allegation with an alleged and strong indication of pre-match knowledge from a well-known match-fixer. Therefore, in my view, this case should command a swift, strong and, most importantly, an international and coordinated investigation to clear the air in the interest of football and all concerned.’
