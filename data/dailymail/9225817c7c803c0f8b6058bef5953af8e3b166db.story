Sick: David Adams, 65, had the images in a cache of 150,000 indecent images of children

A paedophile who kept pictures of dead babies on his computer was jailed for 18 months yesterday.

David Adams, 65, had the images from post-mortems in a file marked 'Dead Kids' within his huge cache of pornography.

Also on the computer at his home in Harlesden, North-West London,  were thousands of images of young children being raped and tortured.

Prosecutor Peter Zinner told Southwark Crown Court that the sick images were a 'new benchmark of depravity'.

'The prosecution has never seen such appalling images for sexual gratification,' he said

More than 150,000 images were found in a police raid on Adams's home in 2009.

Of the stash, around 11,000 were judged by officers to be in the most serious category - including depicting rape and torture.

Twenty two images were taken from post-mortem examinations and showed the bodies of children up to two years old.

But the sentence given to means he could be released from jail in as little as nine months.

Children's campaigners say they will appeal against the sentence, saying it is far too low for such sickening crimes. 

Shey Keenan of Phoenix Chief Associates told the Sun: 'This is in no way adequate for this monster.

'What an invasion of a child's body and a new low in wickedness.

We'll be appealing to the attorney general. He needs at least six years to even start addressing his behaviour.' 

Adams admitted making indecent images of children.

The court also heard that the images of dead children were not overtly sexual - leading to some confusion among officers as to how to classify them.
