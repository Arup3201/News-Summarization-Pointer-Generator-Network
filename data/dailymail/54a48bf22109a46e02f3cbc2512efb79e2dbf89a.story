A chef says he has been inundated with orders for fried brains, stomachs and decapitated heads despite serving them in a busy hospital.

Milorad Djordjevic chose a working hospital in Nis, Serbia, for his Mace Restaurant because the premises were cheaper then opening up on the high street.

He insists his offal dishes have been popular - despite doctors having to operate on organs such as brains and stomachs straight after lunch.

Chef Milorad Djordjevic says he has been inundated with orders for fried brains (pictured), stomachs and calves' heads at his Mace Restaurant - despite serving them in a busy hospital in the Serbian city of Nis

Mr Djordjevic's menu includes boiled or fried brains, devilled kidneys, tripe (stomach) and tripe soup, along with entire heads of veal calves.

His specials board, an A4 sheet of paper sellotaped to the hospital wall, promises: 'Very good prices. You will not regret.'

The emergency room is on the same floor, and local newspapers pointed out the dishes could offend patients.

But the chef insisted: 'I can see that it makes a 
few headlines but at the end of the day I serve good quality food and 
I'm always busy.

'If it's not doctors and nurses queueing up then it's 
patients or their visitors, and I haven't had any complaints despite the 
newspaper headlines.'

Gruesome: A whole calf's head on the menu at the restaurant, where the chef insists business is booming

He insisted that just because he was in a hospital, he should not be barred from serving 'gourmet' foods.

And he said the only 
difference between his restaurant and others was that medics often leap up and rush off halfway through to answer urgent calls.

'When that happens, we simply put the 
half finished meal to one side and if they want, heat it up for them 
again when they come back', he said.

'The hospital's emergency department is on the 
same floor so we are used to people not having a lot of time to eat'

'The hospital's emergency department is on the 
same floor so we are used to people not having a lot of time to eat.'

With business booming, Mr Djordjevic said the decision to offer 
exotic foods from his restaurant at the heart of the hospital clearly made good 
economic sense.

'We are full all the time and the overheads low, so what could be better,' he said.

The brains and stomachs on his menu mostly come from pigs, but occasionally from sheep too.

Offal
 and innards are not unheard of on menus in the Balkans, where meat 
dishes are similar to Greek cuisine or other eastern European dishes.

Serbian
 dishes include mainstream offerings like moussaka and wiener schnitzel -
 but also a traditional soup made from pigs' innards.

The menu reads: 'Restaurant in the emergency building: Soups, cooked dishes, grilled specialties, salad etc. The house specialty: calf's head, beef tails, fried tripe, fried brain... very good prices. You will not regret'

It involves parboiling the animal's liver, lung, head and intestines in salt water before adding spices, including a bay leaf.

Philip Evans, who researches and imports Balkan food to Britain through his firm Pelagonia, told MailOnline: 'The region was under the Ottoman empire for a long time so a lot of the food traditions are Turkish, and offal is pretty common.

'It's definitely more usual to see offal across the Balkans than it is in the UK.

'In the travel I've done in the region every country has a different take on it. When I was in Kosovo they told me the lungs were particularly good.'
