The 15-year-old boy accused of stabbing 
his two young brothers to death appeared 
shackled in court today with his father at his side as the defense attorney revealed the 'family is coping as best they can'.

The bodies of Benjie Vidinhar, four, and his brother Alex, ten, from 
Utah, were found on May 22 by their mother. She left them with her 
eldest son while she took her daughters to a dance recital.

The 15-year-old was arrested a few hours later.

His defense attorney told the judge today: 'I believe the family is coping with everything the best that they can.'

The teen agreed to waive his preliminary hearing, during which 
prosecutors would have presented their evidence against him and a judge 
would have determined whether or not to order a trial for two counts of 
murder, the Deseret News reports.

It will be decided now whether or not the teen will be tried as an adult.

The Davis County Attorney’s Office has indicated it wants to certify the
teen to stand trial as an adult. The boy’s father, however, has said he
hopes his son will stay in the juvenile court system.

'I understand that there must be justice, but life without parole would 
be way too harsh for a 15-year-old with no previous criminal history,' 
he said just after the slayings. 

Defense attorney Todd Utzinger said in court today that his client was 'aware of the gravity of the situation' but they will fight to keep it out of the adult system.

'We believe someone who just barely turned 15 should stay in the 
juvenile system,' he said. 'A lot of the research shows the brain (at 
that age) isn’t fully developed.'

Police said after the killings they had a motive but did not disclose what it was.
