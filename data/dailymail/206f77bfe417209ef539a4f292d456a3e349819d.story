If tucking into chunk of brie or a creamy cappuccino is your idea of heaven, and you’re fed up of counting calories, you could just let cows do the dieting for you.

Scientists have discovered that feeding cows rapeseed makes for a healthier milk.

In a three-year experiment, groups of dairy cows were fed rapeseed supplements, which reduced the saturated fat content of their milk by more than a 25 per cent.

Moo-ve over red-top milk: Scientists claim that feeding cows oilseed makes for healthier milk. Their results showed that their healthy diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis-monounsaturated fats and trans fats in the milk produced

The experiment was conducted among 22 dairy farms in south west England for over a month.

After this period the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent, without altering the overall fat content of the milk. At the same time, monounsaturated fats were increased by an average of nine per cent.

A further experiment showed that adding an oil-based supplement to a cow’s diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis-monounsaturated fats and transfats.

Milk and dairy are vital components of our diet, providing about a quarter of our daily protein needs and up to 60 per cent of vital nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus. But they can also contain a saturated fat.

Cardiovascular disease is the UK's single biggest killer, responsible for more than 88,000 deaths each year.

The change in diet also increased both monounsaturated fats and natural trans fats, which are both thought to have health benefits.

Scientists from the University of Reading claim that the milk tastes just as good as the less healthy alternative.

This is because mono-unsaturated fats fill the gap where saturated fats have been reduced, which could be helpful for people eating a dairy-rich diet who might be at an increased risk of heart attacks.

Cardiovascular disease is the UK's single biggest killer, responsible for more than 88,000 deaths each year and a key government recommendation in tackling heart disease is to reduce the amount of saturated fat in our diets.

Milk and dairy foods are the largest single source of saturated fat in the UK diet, but also provide essential nutrients, so reducing the amount of milk we drink may be counter-productive. 

Milk is rich in calcium as well as  phosphorous, magnesium and protein which are all essential for healthy bones.

Milking it? The scientists claim that the milk tastes as good as the less healthy alternative, but this will be put to the test when they conduct a further experiment to see if their healthier dairy products (a stock image is pictured) are appealing to other people and if they could reduce the risk of heart disease

Saturated fat is largely found in cream, cheese, butter and fatty meats as well as prepared food like pizza and sausage.

Consuming high amounts of saturated fats can increase people's risk of heart disease.

Monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil are typically liquid at room temperature.

They provide nutrients to main the body's cells and are high in antioxidant vitamin E.

Eaten in moderation they have health benefits and can help reduce bad cholesterol levels in the blood and lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Monounsaturated fats include: rapeseed oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil and sesame oil as well as avocados, nuts and seeds.

A total of 22 dairy farms in the south west of England were fed rapeseed supplements for over a month.

After this period, the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent, without altering the overall fat content of the milk. At the same time, monounsaturated fats were increased by an average of nine per cent.

The second study took place at the University of Reading's farm and looked in detail at the effect of different fats in the diet of the dairy cow.

Results showed that adding an oil-based supplement to a cow’s diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis-monounsaturated fats and transfats.

Professor Ian Givens, project leader of the experiment at the University of Reading, said: ‘Adult milk consumption in the UK has dropped from about three litres per week in the 1970s to less than one litre. This is a big concern.

‘Milk and dairy are vital components of our diet, providing about a quarter of our daily protein needs and up to 60 per cent of vital nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus. Consumers need to regain faith in milk.

‘There is evidence that replacing a proportion of the saturated fats in milk with mono or polyunsaturated fats improves human cholesterol levels once consumed. Both our studies showed adding oilseed to a cow’s diet could be the answer.’

To build on the study, the researchers will examine whether their healthier milk and dairy could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Professor Julie Lovegrove who is leading the forthcoming Medical Research Council-backed study said: ‘After producing SFA-reduced milk at our farm, we will then make cheese and butter from this milk in our Food Processing Plant. 

‘The effects of consuming these SFA-reduced dairy foods compared with normal products will then be carried out at our Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition.’
