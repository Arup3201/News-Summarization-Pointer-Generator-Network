North Korean students will take part in a media studies course funded by taxpayers, amid fears they could just learn how to pedal propaganda about Kim Jong-un because the regime controls the media. 

More than 40 students from North Korea will take part in a media course in the UK, funded by British taxpayers.

The course, which has been organised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, aims to show students how British media works as well as teach them how to build websites. 

But there are fears the training will merely give the 46 students the means to pedal propaganda for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, because the media is notoriously tightly controlled in the country.

Lord Alton of Liverpool, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea, has accused the foreign office of 'investing in people who are official mouthpieces of the regime,' the Sunday Express reported.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has confirmed it is funding the project, which will be delivered by the Thomson Foundation and is called 'Inside Out: Working in North Korea to connect its journalists to an internet world.' 

There are claims it could cost £70,000. 

But the FCO said no figures for the course had been finalised, and said it was being run as part of the 'critical engagement' activities with the country.

In a written answer to the House of Lords Baroness Anelay of St Johns said 'The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting.'

She added: 'The project aims to expose participants to the UK media, instructing them on international reporting practices and the development of technical skills to build websites using a variety of international sources.' 

The students took part in a pilot workshop in Pyongyang in October.

The study tour to the UK will take place in early 2015.

North Korea has one of the most restrictive attitudes to the media in the world, precisely controlling information coming into and out of the country.

Journalists have to be a member of the Workers' Party and prove that they come from families with reliable political backgrounds. There is just one agency service for the country. 

A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'The UK has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of horrifying human rights violations in North Korea. Last month, the international community condemned these abuses with a strong resolution in the United Nations. 

News of the death of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il took two days to be released because of the tight controls on the media in the country that sees what can be reported as restricted by the regime 

The Foreign Office confirmed it would be funding the media training for the 47 students from North Korea 

'This project is an example of the type of international exposure recommended by the UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights in the DPRK. It is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in North Korea.' 

A United Nations report earlier this year found that North Koreans are not able to express opinions that are critical of the regime or its official ideology.

It said: 'There is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association.' 

The report said that propaganda is used by the State to create obedience to the leader and that no expression of criticism of the political system goes unpunished, with public executions and people being sent to prison camps known as the 'ultimate' punishments. 

An example of the extent the state controls the press was seen when Kim Jong-il died in 2011, but it took two days for news of the death of the former leader to be released.

North Korea is one of the most controlling media environments in the world.

All news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored.

There is just one news agency, the North Korean Central News Agency, that operates throughout the country.  

Internet access is poor, with many north Koreans only able to access a form of an intranet. 

But mobile phones have appeared after a ban was lifted in 2008. 

Radios and televisions supplied to North Koreans come pre-tuned to Government-controlled stations such as Korean Central Television.  

Since Kim Jong-un took over from his father in 2011 there have been attempts to improve media access and information flowing from the country. 

This has included an interview Dennis Rodman gave to CNN after travelling to the country earlier this year, following a previous trip where he struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim Jong-un. 

But a lot of the news coming from north Korea has been seen as being staged and managed, merely to just imply access has improved. 

North Korea also allowed American prisoners to be interviewed by the news channel, but the process again seemed controlled as the prisoners appeared to have been coached about what to say as they asked American officials for help.

Before the death of Kim Jong-il residents were bombarded with positive news about the former leader, such as his visits to industrial projects.  

Information about the country's economic difficulties of famines are not generally reported to domestic audiences. 

In 2013 some controls were relaxed as visitors were allowed to bring their mobile phones into the country. 

However calls between locals and foreigners are still prohibited. 

A black market, reportedly at the border with China, appears to be in operation and enables North Koreans to watch some South Korean shows.
