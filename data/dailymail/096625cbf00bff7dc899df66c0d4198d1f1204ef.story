Excited fans of Martin Freeman are being made to delete photos snapped on their mobile phones during his performance of Richard III after falling foul of theatre rules.

The acclaimed West End production has attracted people who want to see the Sherlock and Hobbit star in the flesh as the villainous Shakespeare character. 

Many are first-time visitors to the theatre and they are taking pictures as a souvenir, in defiance of both copyright laws and theatre etiquette.

Ban: Hobbit fans who are going to the theatre to see Richard III just so they can take photos of Martin Freeman are being made to delete their photos

Culprits spotted by staff at London’s Trafalgar Studios are made to delete images before they leave the auditorium, while those who aren’t spotted but later post them online have been made to remove them due to copyright infringements.

One blogger wrote: ‘A woman two rows ahead of me took pictures of the set before the performance and was immediately noticed by an usher, who told her she had to delete all pictures – and then stood there until she did. Serious business!’

Another theatre-goer was made to pixelate the image she posted. She wrote: ‘The staging and set design are brilliant.

Here’s a definitely illegal photo of the stage, which is now edited to be unrecognisable because I was asked to remove it due to copyright infringement.’

It is not the first time Freeman’s fans have upset the theatre establishment. Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday revealed how they were criticised for applauding the actor without waiting for an interval or the final curtain.

One usher told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We have never seen such a big problem. There is a new audience who have not been to the theatre before and don’t know the etiquette. 

'Martin Freeman is such a big star that they think it is OK. Audiences are warned when they come in not to take photos, so there is no excuse.’

A production spokesman said: ‘The designers have the copyright to their set designs. 

'That, added to the fact that part of the staging is for the enjoyment for new audiences, means that no photography is permitted.’

Ignorant of etiquette - many are breaking 'no photos' rule only to later be told to remove images from online posts as they are breaching copyright law
