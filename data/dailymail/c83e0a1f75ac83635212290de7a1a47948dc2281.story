Scores of NHS jobs could be shipped off to India under cost-saving plans being considered by health chiefs, unions have claimed.

The country's biggest health union, Unison, said the cuts could cost 900 British workers their jobs - with many going to the subcontinent.

NHS England managers are set to consider the plans at a crunch board meeting tomorrow.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is not in control of the day-to-day running of the NHS. A new body called NHS England was created and put in charge by his predecessor Andrew Lansley, in his controversial overhaul of the health service

Most of the roles under threat are low paid 'back office' jobs, such as dealing with prescription charges, payments to GPs and crucial referrals for cancer screening.

Unison has written to board members urging them to reconsider the plans, which emerged in agenda papers published last week.

A spokeswoman for NHS England confirmed to MailOnline that the proposal was due to be debated tomorrow. She said: 'There's going to be some discussion at our board meeting tomorrow.'

An NHS England spokesman later added: 'This is a very important set of changes that we are considering for the benefit of patients and the public.

'The aim is to free up funding from administrative costs for frontline health services.

'We have worked closely with our staff and the unions to ensure we understand their views and concerns. No final decision will be made until June.'

One of the proposals being considered is that the number of staff currently working in India would rise from about 20 to about 60.

Christina McAnea, Unison's head of health, attacked the plan and called on NHS England to keep the jobs in Britain.

She said: 'These proposals have been hammered out behind closed doors and are mired in secrecy.

'Staff are being kept in the dark about their futures and this is very upsetting and disruptive for them personally and for the service.

'The potential loss of at least 900 jobs and the closure of dozens of offices across the UK will be a bitter blow to workers and their families.

'At a time when many companies are bringing back services from abroad, it is shameful that NHS England is seeking to make quick savings by outsourcing some work to India.'

Ordinary health staff will be furious at the revelation that British jobs could be outsourced to India. It comes just days after the expenses claims of former health service chief Sir David Nicholson and his NHS England colleagues were revealed

The controversial proposals come after it emerged nine health officials from NHS England spent almost £200,000 last year on fine dining, taxi fares and hotels at up to £500 a night.

Patients’ groups said it was 'an absolute disgrace' that officials cutting jobs across the NHS were able to enjoy such perks.

NHS England was set up by ministers, as part of Andrew Lansley's overhaul of the health service, and was headed by Sir David Nicholson until he stood down recently.

Sir David billed taxpayers for a total of £32,000 during 2013-14, the figures show, including £6,700 on taxis. The 69 claims for taxis and cars include one fare of more than £500 for a journey from London to Preston.

The highest individual bill was for Tim Kelsey, national director for patients and information, who spent £46,000 during the year — including more than £21,000 on hotels and dining, with claims of up to £370 a night.

Mr Kelsey, who is responsible for the troubled programme to centralise GP records, also spent almost £7,000 on air fares.

Jane Cummings, NHS chief nursing officer, spent more than £27,000 in total, including £8,000 on hotels and dining, the records show.

Bill McCarthy, who recently resigned as national director for policy, spent more than £23,000, the figures show. The sums claimed include £491 on a four night stay in a hotel in Berkshire, following a £313 train journey from Leeds.

The new head of the health service, Simon Stevens, has now announced a clampdown on lavish spending and a ban on first-class travel, telling staff at NHS England to 'think like a patient and act like a taxpayer'.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, said: 'It is an absolute disgrace when patients are waiting longer for care, when frontline staff are so overloaded, and when there are such difficulties in some parts of the service, to see this scale of excess at the top of the organisation. It truly beggars belief.'

Roger Goss, from charity Patient Concern, added: 'It’s ludicrous for the organisers of the NHS to live a lavish lifestyle while trying to persuade the rest of the health service to save billions on providing care to patients. It really is an outrage that these sorts of sums have been diverted from the taxpayer, when they were intended for patient care.'
