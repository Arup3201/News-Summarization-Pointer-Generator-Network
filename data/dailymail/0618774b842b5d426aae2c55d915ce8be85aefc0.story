The Australian Prime Minister has been praised for her strong stance on sexism and misogyny in government during a heated debate on the parliamentary speaker’s text scandal.

Julia Gillard spent 15 minutes attacking leader of the opposition Tony Abbott before the Australian House of Representatives during a debate over a motion to sack the Speaker of the House, Peter Slipper after a series of text messages he sent to his male assistant referring to women in a derogatory way were made public.

The debate has sparked a national and international debate. The New Yorker Magazine even suggested that American President Barack Obama could learn a thing or two from Ms Gillard in politics following the heated debate.

Heated debate: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard spent 15 minutes attacking the leader of the opposition Tony Abbott (pictured together in 2010) saying 'if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia... he needs a mirror'

Her stance comes after popular radio DJ Alan Jones announced on his show that women in power were 'destroying the joint', fuelling a national debate around the extent of sexism still apparent in the country.

Ms Gillard targeted Mr Abbott during debate in parliament yesterday.

She said: ‘I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. I will nota nd the government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. Not now, not ever.

‘If he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives. He needs a mirror.’

Ms Gillard's statements came as they debated a motion to sack Speaker of the House Peter Slipper after text messages referring to women in derogatory way were made public

The text messages from Mr Slipper were revealed during a court hearing last week when he defended himself against sexual harassment accusations brought by his former assistant, James Ashby.

The messages shocked politicians, resulting in a bitter row in parliament over whether he should be removed from the Speaker’s seat.

Attempts by Liberal MPs including Mr Abbott to have him sacked failed by just one vote but later Mr Slipper, choking back his emotions, told the parliament that he was standing down because ‘the importance of the Role of Speaker in the House of Representatives is far greater than my own role.’

During his motion to sack the speaker, Mr Abbott said that every day Ms Gillard supported Mr Slipper was ‘another day of shame for a government which should already have died of shame’.

Ms Gillard highlighted statements made by Mr Abbott in the past including that he said that ‘abortion is the easy way out’ and ‘what housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing’ during a debate on the carbon tax, which was recently introduced.

She said: ‘I was offended too by the sexism, by the misogyny of the Leader of the Opposition catcalling across this table at me, as I sit here as prime minister, “If the prime minister wants to, politically speaking, make an honest woman of herself,” something that would never have been said to any man sitting in this chair.

‘I was offended when the leader of the opposition went outside in the front of Parliament and stood next to a sign that said ‘Ditch the Witch”.’

National debate: Popular radio DJ Alan Jones announced on his show that women in power were 'destroying the joint', fuelling a national debate around the extent of sexism still apparent in the country

New Yorker magazine wrote: ‘After his performance last week, supporters of President Obama, watching Gillard cut through the disingenuousness and feigned moral outrage of her opponent to call him out for his own personal prejudice, hypocrisy, and aversion to facts, might be wishing their man would take a lesson from Australia.’

A huge backlash to Radio presenter Mr Jones’ comments about women in high power positions, as well as remarks he made that Ms Gillard’s father (who died recently) ‘died of shame’ has led to a media campaign against him.

Consumer backlash also led to sponsors dropping their advertisements from his breakfast show on radio station 2GB.
