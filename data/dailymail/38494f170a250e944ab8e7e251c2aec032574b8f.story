A woman who had her eyes gouged out in one of Britain's most horrific domestic assaults has allegedly been attacked again.

Mother-of-two Tina Nash, 33, permanently lost her sight in April 2011 when savage Shane Jenkin gouged her eyes out.

The 18-stone brute was jailed for life in a secure mental health unit in May 2012 and ordered to serve at least six years before being considered for release.

Jenkin, 34, failed in an appeal against the sentence last year and Tina said she was looking forward to rebuilding her life.

But it emerged yesterday that she is now the victim of another assault.

The latest attack is reported to have happened on Sunday in Penzance, Cornwall, where Tina lives.

Her 32 year-old boyfriend appeared before magistrates in Truro on Tuesday charged with one count of assault against her.

Roland Alli, from Plymouth, pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody. He is due to stand trial in August.

Tina became a campaigner against domestic violence after her nightmare ordeal with Jenkin.

She wrote a book highlighting the scourge of abuse in the home and begged other victims to seek help and not stay silent.

She spoke movingly of her own experience and urged women to flee abusive relationships 'before it is too late'.

Her book Out Of The Darkness describes how Jenkin beat her unconscious and poked out her eyes at her home, telling her: 'You're never going to see your kids again.'

The 12-hour attack - which also left her with a broken jaw and nose - happened as her sons Ben, 13, and Liam, three, were sleeping in the same house.

She wrote: 'I sat up and reached my hand to my face... and felt my eyeball hanging halfway down my cheek.

'I touched my slippery eyeball, like I couldn't believe it was real. My other eye was swollen to the size of a tennis ball.'

Tina told other victims: 'It's not going to get better, it's going to get worse.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
