Man with a pram: Michael Kenny, at Norland College where he was the first male student, with his 'reality baby'

Michael Kenny makes for an unlikely Mary Poppins. The 18-year-old is a keen second-row rugby player, his cooking repertoire extends only to boiling some pasta and heating a jar of sauce, and he can’t even sew a cushion.

He also admits, without the faintest trace of irony, that until recently ‘I didn’t think such things as nannies existed. I thought they were just in children’s books and films’.

In fact, his only hint of domestic prowess is washing his own dirty socks. ‘I have a washing machine and it’s not hard to use,’ says Michael in his very first interview.

But Michael has just become the first man to study for a degree at the prestigious Norland College in its 120-year history.

At the end of his four-year course, he will join the ranks of the supernanny elite, some of whom have gone on to care for the children of royals, pop stars and the super-rich in Miami, Geneva and Los Angeles, commanding salaries up to £50,000.

Despite spending the next four years in an all-female environment, there’s nothing in the slightest bit girly about Michael. Yes, he will be having a stab at quilt-making and how to change a nappy, but he’s also a down-to-earth sort of man.

Michael confesses to being a rather sporty type with a love of the outdoors and has a steady girlfriend who thoroughly approves of his unusual career choice – as does his mother, who inspired him to apply to Norland in the first place.

Any jibes about spoons full of sugar and nursery rhymes are taken philosophically. And no, he doesn’t believe it is controversial to employ a man as a nanny – it gives parents a choice,  he explains.

‘Any situation in which my male friends can turn a phrase on me and make people laugh they’ll do it,’ he chuckles.

However, his girlfriend, Ellie Hatherwell, an 18-year-old first year history student at York University, is ‘very supportive’. ‘I’d like to think I’ve given her the impression so far that she doesn’t need to worry about me being in a class with48 girls,’ says Michael.

He adds: ‘It is intimidating going into Norland for the first time. The gates do paint quite a picture. I was walking in on the first day and as I came down the steps, there was a rippling effect of whispers – and then silence. I did get a few looks. It was daunting.

‘The whispers didn’t last too long, though. I found some girls  I knew and things soon went back to normal.  A lot of the girls ask me how I’m coping with being the only male there. It’s good that they’re so supportive.’

'9am: So many things to remember! No drinking and pramming in public - and never ever leave a baby in a KFC'

Raised by Mary, a bookshop owner, and Simon, a civil servant at the Department for International Development, Michael spent his early years moving between Nepal and Uganda with his father’s work.

‘Mrs Penny, my second year teacher in Uganda, is my role model,’ he says. ‘I was at an age where school was the last thing I wanted to do but  she made it more enjoyable. To recreate that would be amazing.’

In 2003, Michael’s family moved to Kazakhstan and to Ethiopia, before returning to Uganda. Michael later attended Kingswood School in Bath, where he took up rugby until a slipped disc hampered his progress in the sport. His sister Alice, 17, and brother John, 12, still attend schools in Uganda.

‘Coming to England was a shock as the only schooling I’d known was in Uganda,’ he admits. ‘In Africa the buildings were all very open,  the weather was lovely and I enjoyed outdoor activities such as  camping.’

Michael took A-levels in theology, philosophy and design technology, but decided on a career working with children after volunteering to teach maths and English to disabled children at the Katalemwa Cheshire Home for Rehabilitation Services in the Ugandan capital, Kampala.

'5pm: It's not all work being the only man in a class of 49. We have so much in common: we love children and matching beige uniforms!'

‘A lot of the children had cerebral palsy and many couldn’t speak English, or speak at all in some cases. That pushed me in the direction of working with children,’ he says.

‘I really enjoyed helping them learn how to how to hold pencils and also move objects through different shaped holes.’

However, he balked when his mother first suggested that he should apply to Norland College, which is now based in Bath.

‘I knew about Norland and the idea of it can seem quite intimidating as the college has such a reputation. At the time I didn’t even know if Norland took on male applicants.’

However, after speaking to ‘Norlanders’ who were sub-letting his parents’ house in Bath and looking at their timetables, Michael decided to apply to join the BA (Hons) course in Early Childhood Studies. Norland was the only college he applied to.

What attracted him was Norland’s graduate success rate – it has  been reported that the average  Norlander receives 15 job offers upon graduation.

‘Because it was my only option, the interview was even more nerve-racking,’ he recalls.

Open-minded celebs: Gwyneth Paltrow, left, and Jemima Khan, right, have had male nannies

‘I was wondering what the receptionist’s face would look like when I   arrived and said I was there for an interview. There was a slight look of  bemusement, but actually she was very professional.’

Known as the Rolls-Royce of  nannies, Norlanders have been hired by Princess Anne and the Duchess of York, as well as Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall.

For a few years, ‘mannies’ became all the rage with Madonna, Elle Macpherson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Britney Spears, Jemima Khan and Keeley Hawes all employing men to care for their children.

And yet they remain a rarity and the debate continues over whether ‘mannies’ should bathe, dress and tend to young children.

Earlier this month, more than 300 parents joined a fierce debate on the Mumsnet website. The majority were in favour of male nannies but a sizeable number raised objections, which ranged from fears for a child’s safety to a man’s ability to do the job as well as a woman.

Despite this, eight out of ten parents say that it is more acceptable now than ten years ago to hire a male nanny, according to a survey conducted in 2009 by Tinies, one of the largest domestic recruitment firms in the UK.

Michael has no doubts. ‘Some families could hold the view that women are more inherently nurturing of children.’ Asked how he would try  to allay the fears of reticent families, he replies diplomatically: ‘It’s their choice.’

Though he was determined to work with children, he was initially uncertain about joining Norland, whose female students wear an Edwardian-style uniform of fawn dresses, sensible lace-up shoes, hats and prim white gloves.

‘When my mother first put forward the idea of going to Norland,  I said “No way,” ’ he admits.

‘You walk around Bath and see the uniform and know what it represents. What put me off was the fact that I didn’t think I’d fit in.’

However, after speaking to former students, Michael did a U-turn and sent in his application form. His decision has earned him the nickname Manny among his male friends, many of whom are bemused at his unlikely career choice.

After being accepted on the course, he was given his own tailor-made Norlander uniform – a tweed blazer, a fawn tie embroidered with the  ‘N’ logo, a cream shirt and chinos from Gap.

Only one other male student has passed through Norland College, but Michael is first to take a degree. In 2005, Peter Cummins, from Dyfed, took a three-year diploma. At the time, Peter said: ‘I don’t see any problem. My careers adviser hinted that it was very female-dominated, but I took no notice.

‘My male friends call me the Manny, but my female friends are very supportive.

‘My father also said it was a great opportunity. Some people would think he was hard on me but there was no problem. Females might already have certain experiences but there’s nothing that Norland can’t teach me.’

The degree course is a mix of classroom lessons and practical experiences. It costs £13,710 a year for the first two years and £4,120 a year for the final two years.

Past Norlanders have been taught how to drive on icy roads without skidding, how to sew a rag doll, prepare a home-made chicken curry, and how to massage a child to sleep – a skill likely to be popular with some celebrities. Gwyneth Paltrow recently said that she often massages her six-year-old son Moses  to sleep.

Michael says: ‘Being male might help me appeal to a family with more boys than girls. They might want a male role model for their children.

‘I’m not saying that wouldn’t happen with female graduates, but it could be to my advantage.‘Of course, some people might hold the view that it is a female profession and that women are more inherently nurturing of children.

‘It’s their choice, but hopefully there will be people who see it as an equal gender job.’

Posing proudly for photographs with his Edwardian-style Silver Cross pram and his impeccably-behaved reality baby (Norland College forbids it being called a doll), Michael says: ‘Being male and a nanny has never been a concern.  I don’t think that gender should be held against somebody.

‘One week in and already, I feel part of the Norland family.’
