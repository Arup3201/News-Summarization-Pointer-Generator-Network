Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles director Michael Bay expresses disbelief that a poster was designed without his approval featuring the movieâ€™s heroes jumping out of an exploding building under a release date of 9/11.

Michael Bay is unimpressed with the blunder

Bay said he was just as upset about the controversial poster shared on Paramount Pictures Australia's Twitter page as the fans were and he made sure he let the studio executives know.

'When I woke up and saw that, I said, "Are you kidding me?" That was a silly, dumb mistake,' he said.'Trust me - I yelled at them. Normally everything goes through me, and no one showed me that poster.'

Paramount Australia, who deleted the post shortly after when the oversight was pointed out on Tuesday, has apologised for the embarrassing blunder which was met with outrage on social media from the movie's diehard fans.

The studio issued a statement saying 'combining that image and date was a mistake'.

'We are deeply sorry to have used that artwork for the marketing materials promoting the September 11 opening in Australia,' the statement said.

'We intended no offence and have taken immediate action to discontinue its use.'

Controversial: Paramount Australia has sparked outrage after promoting the September 11 release of the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film with a poster showing the heroes falling from an exploding building

Ill-advised: The tweet sharing the promotional poster was quickly met with angry responses on social media - some of which called for those behind the release to lose their jobs

The film, which stars Megan Fox and Johnny Knoxville, is released in August in the United States and October in Europe, but its Australian release date comes exactly 13 years to the day after 19 hijackers took control of four airliners and carried out the deadly September 11 attacks.

The controversial poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks, which claimed the lives of 2,996 people.

One of the Twitter replies, posted by user @MorningAfterKill said: 'So who's getting fired for this poster art? September 11? Exploding buildings? People falling out of them? Le sigh'.

Another message by @AusFestivus added: 'Guys. Sept 11 and exploding buildings is a bad look okay', while a third tweet, by @yilmaz16, said: 'Really 9/11? Jumping out of an exploding building?'

Paramount has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster, and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release.

Advice: The reason the poster proved controversial was due to the unfortunate release date of September 11 and the use of an exploding building to promote the film

Anger: The poster was shared on Paramount Australia's Twitter page last night, and immediately drew dozens of negative comments from angry film fans

Outrage: Paramount has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster, and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release

Resemblance: The poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks (pictured), which killed 2,996 people in 2001

After New York's famous Twin Towers were struck by two aircraft coming up to 13 years ago, there was a period of between one and two hours before they collapsed during which dozens if not hundreds of people were seen leaping and falling to their deaths from the burning buildings.

Out of the 2,996 people killed in the four coordinated attacks, 11 of them were Australian citizens.

As yet Paramount has issued no statement or apology about the controversial poster, nor has it made any explanation of the decision to release the new film on the anniversary of the attacks.
