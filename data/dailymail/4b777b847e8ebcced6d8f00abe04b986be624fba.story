Her eyes shining with  anticipation, the young woman holds a balloon to
 her lips. For all the world, it looks as if she's about to perform a 
children's party trick.

Yet a quick examination of her surroundings (an expensive London 
nightclub) and her appearance (glossy hair, designer heels) tells you 
that this is far from a  children's party.

Indeed, the young woman is something of a celebrity — Coronation Street 
actress Michelle Keegan. And far from performing a trick, she is 
indulging in a fashionable — and potentially fatal — drug craze: 
inhaling nitrous oxide, the 'legal high' du jour.

Dangerous: Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan indulging in a fashionable ¿ and potentially fatal ¿ drug craze: inhaling nitrous oxide, the 'legal high' known as 'hippy crack'

Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, 
so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and 
their well-heeled young fans alike. Even Prince Harry was seen indulging
 two years ago.

There is just one problem: nitrous oxide is no more legal than it is 
innocuous. Despite being touted openly at music  festivals and in bars 
and nightclubs across the country, sale of the gas for recreational use 
is very much against the law.

As for being innocuous, that is only true if one ignores the alarming 
side-effects it can cause: strokes, hallucinations,  seizures, 
blackouts, incontinence, stress on the heart, chronic depression and 
even — in cases of prolonged use — depleted bone marrow. Few would tack 
the word 'harmless' on to such a list.

Now anti-drugs campaigners are calling for more to be done to tackle the
 trend. Not that their voices are being heard, swamped as they are by 
those of the enthusiasts. In the past month alone, several minor — yet 
influential — celebrities have jumped on the bandwagon.

As well as Keegan, James Argent and Maria Fowler, stars of The Only Way 
Is Essex, have been pictured with a balloon between their lips.

They are among tens of thousands of young people who have dabbled with 
the drug. And, as it sells at the bargain price of £1.50 per balloon, 
many indulge in it every weekend.

Nitrous oxide — also known as laughing gas, N2O and sweet air — gives 
users an intense euphoria which some have likened to the effects of 
heroin and crack cocaine.

Aficionados insist this is a huge exaggeration, and maintain that it is 
far less harmful than other illegal drugs — indeed vastly preferable to 
alcohol, as the effect recedes in minutes and there is no hangover.

Ask the experts, however, and they tell a very different story. When 
inhaled, nitrous oxide dissolves in the bloodstream, depleting the blood
 of oxygen and reducing its flow to the brain and other vital organs. An
 overdose can be fatal.

Stephen Ream, director of  substance abuse charity Re-Solv, is 
unequivocal: 'Every year, people die in this country from taking nitrous
 oxide. You never hear about that when people are selling it in 
nightclubs or at festivals, and I shouldn't imagine most of the users 
even realise it's illegal. It's almost the acceptable face of drug 
abuse.

Problem: Ruby Deevoy says her overindulgence with nitrous oxide led her to suffer severe hallucinations

'Young people see celebrities taking it and they think it must be OK, 
but they should be looking at Demi Moore and what happened to her.'

Unlike the British C-listers associated with the drug, Moore is a 
bona-fide star, and her experience is very much a cautionary tale.

Earlier this year, in the throes of a difficult separation from her  
husband, Ashton Kutcher, the actress reportedly binged on nitrous oxide 
to the extent that she suffered a seizure and had to be taken to 
hospital. She then checked into a rehabilitation clinic.

Yet little was reported about the drug — it was lost in the controversy 
about Moore's romantic  travails and alarming weight loss.

Small wonder, then, that the army of young enthusiasts marches on 
undeterred. On the whole, these are not your average drug users. Nitrous
 oxide's harmless reputation is attracting large numbers of middle-class
 youths who otherwise would never dream of touching drugs.

Ruby Deevoy was one such teenager when she first encountered the gas. 
She has not touched it for two years, but at 23 she still has a vivid 
recollection of its effect on her.  'I first used it when I was about 
16, at a festival,' she says. 'I made friends with the guys on the 
laughing gas stall and basically spent the whole weekend inhaling it.

'It didn't occur to me for a second that it might be illegal. They were selling it so openly.

'They showed festival-goers how to use it. You had to take it from a 
balloon, never direct from the  dispenser, or you could freeze your 
lungs. I absolutely loved it and from then on I did it whenever I 
could.'

The initial effect, Ruby says, was one of unalloyed pleasure. That 
weekend at the festival, however, overindulgence led her to suffer 
severe hallucinations.

'At the beginning, everything kind of goes a bit clouded and all you can
 feel is the bassline of the music,' says Ruby. 'Then suddenly you burst
 out laughing and just keep on laughing. It is a really nice feeling, 
there's no denying that, but if I'd thought it was illegal I'd never 
have done it.

'I must admit I was hallucinating quite badly by the end of my first weekend taking laughing gas.

'On one occasion I crawled into a tent and thought there were dozens of 
people in there, but it was empty. Then I would blink — my eyes were 
closed for no longer than that — but in my mind I'd been in a coma.

'I also remember being mesmerised by the flaming torches on the site to 
the point where I very nearly walked face-first into them.'

Ruby, now a children's author  living near Edinburgh, says she  simply 'grew out' of the drug.

To this day, she remains uncertain about its legality, having been convinced it was a 'legal high'.

The reality, however, is that while she did not commit any offence in 
taking it, those who sold her the gas categorically did, as it's illegal
 to sell it for recreational purposes.

Those caught selling it without a licence can be jailed for up to two 
years. But few are convicted, due in part to the difficulty of proving 
the 'recreational purposes' aspect.

Nick Spears of the Medicines and Healthcare  Products Regulatory Agency,
 says: 'The gas is commonly used on dental patients and for women in 
labour, but you don't go to the dentist every Friday night and you don't
 give birth every Saturday.

Old problem: As far back as the 18th century laughing gas was popular with the aristocracy. But so were opium and cocaine, pictured, and they have caused major issues in our society

'It carries serious long-term health risks for people who use it for fun.'

One of those risks is death. The International Centre For Drug Policy 
charts deaths in the UK from volatile substance misuse, including the 
gas.

Their most recent report, from 2010, notes that 'in 2008 there were
 two deaths (three in 2007) associated with the inhalation of nitrous 
oxide, which had been obtained for non-medical purposes'.

Finding more up-to-date  figures is problematic, as the report is not 
currently active because of  Department Of Health belt-tightening. But 
according to Stephen Ream, the indications are that the death toll has 
carried on in the same vein.

He adds: 'It's not just adults taking it. There is evidence that the users are getting younger, which is a real worry.'

Police as far afield as South London and Somerset have been alerted to 
children as young as 11 inhaling nitrous oxide.

Discarded canisters — 
used in the catering industry to pump whipped cream from dispensers — 
are routinely found in parks and playgrounds, and the drug is readily 
available on the internet. A pack of 24 canisters and a dispenser can be
 purchased for just £20.

Ruby Deevoy's mother Jacqui, a writer, was surprised to hear that the 
drug's sale was illegal. She said: 'I took the photos of Ruby inhaling 
laughing gas at that festival. At that point I had an idea it was some 
kind of helium and that people were buying it to make their voices 
squeaky. I couldn't see any harm in that.

'I told Ruby if she wanted to buy it, she could. It made her giggle for a
 bit, then the effect wore off. I thought at that point that the N2O 
must be like the gas and air I was given when I gave birth to Ruby.

'I loved that stuff — during the course of an eight-hour labour, I got through two canisters.'

Such is the ease of availability that it has even infiltrated middle-class living rooms.

Jacqui continues: 'I have two friends, both women my age, who use it on a
 regular basis for recreational purposes. One of them likes to do it 
just sitting at home, watching the TV. She says it relaxes her. Each to 
their own. It's probably healthier than downing a bottle of wine every 
evening — I know plenty of women my age who do that.'

And there is the rub: like our old foe alcohol, laughing gas is nothing 
new. As far back as the 18th century  it was popular with the 
aristocracy.

But so were opium and cocaine, and we all know the destruction wrought by those drugs once they seeped into our society.
