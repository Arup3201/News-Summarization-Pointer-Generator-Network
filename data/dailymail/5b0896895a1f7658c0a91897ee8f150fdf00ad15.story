As One Direction's personal hair and make-up artist, Lou Teasdale has a job that most teenagers can only dream of.

As Harry, Niall, Zayn, Louis and Liam kick off their Where We Are tour, FEMAIL
 caught up with Lou to find out exactly how she tames Harry Styles' curls, whose hair she would love to shave off and what hot new trends will be taking the beauty world by storm this summer.

Speaking about working with the pop stars, she said: 'My favourite hair at the moment is Louis' because it's got really long and he lets me do fun stuff with it.

'I've been using Fudge Urban Texture Blaster on Niall's hair - we wanted to style his hair a bit flatter for the new video so I blow-dried it really flat and straight so it looked really nerdy but then messed it up with the Texture Blaster and it looked really cool.'

Revealing the secrets behind taming Harry's wild curls, Lou said: 'The secret to curls is to let them dry naturally…if you need to get ready quickly, invest in a good old 80's diffuser attachment for your hairdryer. Not joking.'

Lou, 31,
trained at London College of Fashion and assisted for five years without a pay cheque to her name.

She worked on hair counters at 
shopping centers and assisted hairstylists before getting her big break 
on X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, where she worked for five years.

Friends in high places: Lou is good friends with the likes of Harry Styles, left, and Ed Sheeran, right, who both attended the launch of her beauty bible, The Craft

She
 now travels the world with the One Direction boys - who last night performed in Edinburgh - and has amassed 1.4m 
Twitter followers thanks to her candid beauty tips and fun photofeed - 
Harry Styles is partial to a few selfies with Lou and her baby daughter.

She has also just penned her debut beauty 
bible, The Craft, which features step-by-step make-up and hair tutorials
 that are edgy, stylish and fun.

From
 fancy fishtailing, twisting, or dip-dying your hair to creating the 
perfect foundation base or smokey eye, Lou has it covered and it's safe to say she knows a thing or two about beauty.

So how would she transform the boys' looks if she could have her way?

'I would shave Liam's head again and grow Zayn’s long again. I'm not winning on either,' she laughed.

Lou, who is the global brand
 ambassador for Fudge Urban - a collection of unisex hair styling products inspired by fashion, culture, music and all
 things creative - also shared her top beauty tips for achieving the season's hottest looks.

Those of you who were too afraid to experiment with rainbow hair will be pleased to know that the more muted 'drainbow' hair is the hottest style for this summer.

'Those cool people who live in East London were first on the scene with neon/lumo/vunge green/pink hair last year. And when the dye started to wash out, they accidentally created a whole new look: drainbow,' she said.

'It's a much more wearable colour trend that's great for girls who don't want to go too crazy with their pretty hair.'

Before and after: Working as an ambassador for Fudge Urban, Lou created the iconic One Direction quiff on a male model - and here's the result
