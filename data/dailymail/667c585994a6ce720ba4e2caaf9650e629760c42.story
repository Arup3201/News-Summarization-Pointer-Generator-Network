An extreme weekend exclusively for vampires is being offered this Halloween complete with silk-lined coffins instead of four-poster beds and a blood-curdling menu.

Garlic, mirrors, sharp wooden objects and bibles will be off limits along with anything else the undead are averse to for the 'Big Vampire Weekender' at Fenton Tower near North Berwick, east of Edinburgh.

The fortified 16th-century tower usually used for weddings and five-star accommodation will make the most of impending dark and gloomy weather as dusk 'til dawn become the preferred waking hours and its stunning surrounds are transformed into a ghoulish nightmare for lovers of fangs and dripping claret.

The deluxe building near Edinburgh will be dark, gloomy and downright spooky - just the way vampires like it

A menu of blood-curdling delights will be served to the maximum of 12 guests who can inhabit the space

Luxury rental company Oliver's Travels say the concept is a world first and they aim to tap into the apparent 15,000-member community in the United Kingdom that identifies as some sort of vampire.

Failing that there's the millions of people who make up the global vampire obsession that has made mega-hits of film and TV franchises such as Twilight and True Blood.

'We’re taking our inspiration from the scariest vampires films and books to transform Fenton Tower into the place to stay this Halloween weekend,' says Oliver Bell, co-Founder of Oliver’s Travels

'We have planned for it to take us a number of days to transform this usually bright and airy property into a dark den of despair.'

'Vampires' or enthusiasts can have their blood-curdling desires met at Fenton Tower this Halloween

Creepy basement crypts, blacked-out windows to keep daylight out, and padded coffins will replace the beds in all of the property's rooms.

After dark vampire guests can sip on cocktails such as Blood Red Sangria (red wine, cognac, black grapes and cherries), Vampire Ritual (gin, blueberries and lemon juice) and Fenton Tower's own Vampire’s Punch (cherry, lime juice, grenadine, cherries and lemonade), and order from the strictly garlic-free menu.

The massive modern hit vampire franchise Twilight is available for film screenings on demand 

Vampire film and TV favourites, from Count Dracula to The Vampire Diaries, will be offered on demand or guests may prefer a midnight walk through the chilling countryside.

'I have to say the Big Vampire Weekender is a first of its kind, and we plan to create the most haunting Halloween holiday package out there,' says Bell.

Vampirism isn't for everyone, however, and this is not an offer for all-comers. With a maximum of 12 guests over a weekend the cost works out to £600 per person.
