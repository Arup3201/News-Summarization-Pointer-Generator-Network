A young couple nearly lost their lives in what they claim was a terrifying incident of road rage.

De'Von Heard and his fiancee Kayla Carpenter were driving in Stoneham, Massachusetts on Monday afternoon with friend Manny Ticas, when they claimed a red truck began trying to push them off the road.

This ultimately led to them being driven off a bridge and into the frozen Crooked River.

Three people were almost killed when their SUV went off the road Monday

They claim a man in a red truck drove them off a bridge into the frozen Crooked River

'He wasn't going to stop until he hurt us,' Carpenter told WCSH of the man, who the three say is in custody but whose name has not yet been released.

It all started when the three say the driver of the truck cut them off and then slammed on his breaks, forcing Ticas to rear end him.

Concerned for their safety however, they said that rather than pull over they wanted speak to the man at a gas station - where there would be other people around.

That is allegedly when he started to try and run the three off the road.

The car was being driven by Manny Ticas (far right,m with Carpenter and Heard)

'He wasn't going to stop until he hurt us,' said Carpenter of the driver

'It was no accident. The roads weren't icy. The roads weren't bad. It was premeditated,' said Heard

'He was coming on the shoulder of us, pushing us into the other lane into oncoming traffic,' said Heard.

That is when the SUV ended up the the frozen waters, where luckily all three were able to successfully escape with no injuries, though the car has been totaled.

'It was no accident. The roads weren't icy. The roads weren't bad. It was premeditated. He knew what he was doing,' Heard added.
