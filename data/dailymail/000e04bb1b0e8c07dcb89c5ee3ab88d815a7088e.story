French riot police clashed with train workers during a week long strike, causing some of the worst disruption to the country's rail network in years.

Angry train staff hurled bottles and blocked traffic over a bill to reform the 
state-run railway system.

And the chaos shows no signs of slowing down as
 the reform bill goes to the lower house of Parliament for debate today.

The bill would unite the SNCF train operator with the RFF railway
 network, which would pave the way to opening up railways to 
competition. Workers fear the reform will mean job losses and security 
concerns.

The government says the reform is needed to create a stronger 
structure for the railways, as France and other European countries gear 
up for full-scale railway liberalization in coming years.

Several hundred workers staged a protest Tuesday near the 
National Assembly on Paris' Left Bank, waving red union flags and 
demanding that the bill be delayed or changed.

The protesters blocked cars and tried to push past police to 
approach the parliament building, firing flares and throwing bottles.

OfficersÂ  responded with tear gas and batons and wrestled a few 
protesters to the ground.

The protesters retreated and their 
demonstration continued peacefully.

Later Tuesday, French television showed footage of protesters 
marching onto train tracks at Paris' busy Montparnasse station, which 
links travelers with cities across western and southwest France.

The strike began last Wednesday, and while only a minority of 
workers are taking part, it has disrupted travel on trains across France
 and on commuter lines.

About a third of trains were canceled nationwide
 Tuesday. The strike has not affected international lines such as the 
Eurostar train from Paris to London, but it has caused problems for 
international travelers using the commuter rail to and from Paris' 
Charles de Gaulle Airport.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls broke with the tradition that 
governments don't meddle in strikes, saying Monday that the movement was 'not useful and not responsible.'

Lawmakers begin debating the bill Tuesday afternoon.
