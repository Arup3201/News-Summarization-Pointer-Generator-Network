This clever optical illusion will likely give you the creeps.

Artist Markus Raetz created this unique art installation using two spinning paper chandeliers.

The light source behind the paper gives the appearance of a ghost slowly turning it head from left to right.

The paper has outlines of a faces cut into it, with carefully calculated gradients to create the illusion of an invisible head.

Swiss-born Markus Raetz has created a number of major works, including over 30,000 drawings, focusing on the nature of perception.

The aim of his work, he says, is to focus on what is perceived rather than what the art portrays.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Mr Raetz largely worked on drawings and paintings and has later turned his attention to sculptures, such as the ones shown here.  

These sculptures often require interaction with the viewer, and can be understood only when viewed in motion or from different angles.

For instance, the ‘yes, no’ typographical sculpture changes depending on where the viewer stands.

This sculpture has been cleverly created to read differently from different various angles

Although one solid artwork, it has 
been cleverly created to read differently from different various.  A 
similar public is on display by the artists in Geneva.

Mr Raetz describes it’s a visual poetry written in space. ‘I am doing things everybody can understand,’ he says.

‘It is not complicated work. I can see that in the reaction of children'.
