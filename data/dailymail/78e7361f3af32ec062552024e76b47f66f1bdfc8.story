The Obama administration is moving forward with a controversial plan to ban new uranium mining claims on 1 million acres near the Grand Canyon.

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is today expected to finalise a 20-year ban on new mining claims on public land surrounding the canyon in Arizona.

The White House believes uranium is still an important part of energy strategy but the Grand Canyon is a national treasure to be protected.

Mr Salazar has twice imposed temporary bans on new uranium claims and has fended off pressure from the mining industry and Republicans.

The Grand Canyon attracts more than 4 million visitors a year and generates an estimated $3.5billion in economic activity, Mr Salazar said.

Millions of Americans living in cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, and Los Angeles, California, rely on the Colorado River for clean drinking water.

‘Like our ancestors, we do not know how future Americans will enjoy, experience and benefit from this place,’ Mr Salazar said in June.

‘And that's one of the many reasons why wisdom, caution and science should guide our protection of the Grand Canyon.’

He said it was appropriate to identify what impact mining would have on the canyon and decide what level of risk is acceptable.

Conservation groups call the ban a crucial protection for a U.S. icon.

But
the mining industry and some congressional Republican say it’s 
detrimental to Arizona's economy and the nation's energy independence.

Mr Salazar is expected to talk about his conservation plans at the National Geographic Museum in Washington D.C. on Monday.

Republican members of Arizona's congressional delegation have lambasted temporary bans imposed by Mr Salazar in 2009 and 2010.

A permanent ban on filing new claims would eliminate hundreds of jobs and unravel decades of responsible resource development, they say.

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake and other GOP lawmakers are backing legislation to prevent Mr Salazar from moving forward with the ban.

Environmental groups say the Colorado 
River, which runs through the Grand Canyon, is the source of drinking 
water for 26 million Americans.

Advocacy organisation the Environmental Working Group praised Mr Salazar for defending ‘the Southwest's right to plentiful, clean water’.

As outlined in October, the ban would not affect more than 3,000 mining claims already staked in the area near the Grand Canyon.

The Bush administration had opened up the land to new mining claims - but Mr Salazar reversed the Bush policy in 2009.

He called for a two-year moratorium on new mining claims around the canyon and followed up with a six-month extension last year.

Backers say any increase in jobs is not worth risks to the Colorado River, lands seen as sacred by American Indian tribes or wildlife habitat.

A mining mishap could also be disastrous for tourism in the area.
