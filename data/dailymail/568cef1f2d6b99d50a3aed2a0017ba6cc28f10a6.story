One of Britain’s most prolific burglars has been jailed for his 190th raid.

Career criminal Jason Turner started stealing when he was 12 and had committed 188 offences by the time he was 19.

He was caught on CCTV earlier this month carrying out his latest raid - stealing silver antiques from a house in Cambridge.

Turner, 25, fled after triggering a burglar alarm and was arrested hiding nearby wearing a cap and gloves.

He admitted burglary and was jailed for two years and five months at Cambridge Crown Court.

The court heard his shocking list of convictions included stealing a child’s piggy bank.

In many of his break-ins he sprayed foam into alarms and stole CCTV tapes in a bid to evade capture.

He was jailed for six months for one burglary while armed with a baseball bat and knife.

In 2009, Turner was sentenced to four years for another three raids.

They included break-ins at shops, restaurants and Cambridge United Football Club.

In one he broke into a house with other criminals and stole a 4x4 worth £14,000 which was later found burnt out.

Cambridge Crown Court heard that his most recent raid on September 9 took his crime-spree total to 190.
