A soccer ball kicked into the crowd by Rod Stewart at his Las Vegas concert has bounced back at the singer in the form of a lawsuit.

A 53-year-old Southern California man who says he has lingering injuries after his nose was broken by the ball has filed the suit.

Mostafa Kashe's civil negligence complaint alleges that he didn't expect to be hit in the face by a ball kicked by the raspy-voiced British singer from the stage during a show at the Caesars Palace resort in October 2012.

Representatives of Stewart, promoter AEG Live and Caesars Entertainment Corp. didn't immediately comment Wednesday on the lawsuit filed against them on Monday in Nevada's Clark County District Court.

Michael Roth, of AEG Live, said his firm had not yet been served with the complaint.

Kashe, an electrical engineer from Diamond Bar, California, seeks unspecified damages of at least $10,000 plus attorney fees.

His attorney, Larry Weinsteen, said Kashe and his wife were big Stewart fans who traveled to Las Vegas primarily for the concert.

The lawyer said his client was treated by a hotel medic and filed an injury report with Caesars before being left with 'substantial' injuries including an impaired sense of smell.

Stewart is known for hits including 'Maggie May' and 'Tonight's the Night.'

The 69-year-old London-born rocker also is a longtime soccer fan and club league player.

He frequently kicks autographed balls into the audience at his shows.
