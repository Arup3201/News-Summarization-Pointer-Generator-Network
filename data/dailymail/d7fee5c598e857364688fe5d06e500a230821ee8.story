All he wanted was to see a forest one last time.

Too sick to venture outside Washington's Evergreen Health Hospice for several years, Ed's dying wish was to once more experience the scent of fresh growth and fertile earth.

The former forest ranger who once lived for the outdoors shared his dream with the hospice chaplain, Curt Huber, who made it a reality.

Act of kindness: Evergreen Health Hospice patient Ed, a former forest ranger, was granted his dying wish to see a forest in March. A small team took him on a hospital bed through Meadowdale Beach Park in Edmonds, Washington

Huber reached out to Snohomish County Fire District, whose staff was happy to transport Ed to Meadowdale Beach Park in Edmonds.

In March, a small team including Huber took Ed up and down the trails in a hospital bed, bringing him the scents of the forest by touching the trees and holding their hands close to Edâ€™s face.

Ed was visibly delighted, with North Team Program Manager Diane 
Fiumara saying there is no greater reward than caring for the dying.

'I want to thank my fantastic North Team for
 their love and dedication to the patients they serve,' she said.

One person commented: 'How beautiful for Ed and how wonderful are all those dear people who transported him and made his final wish come true. Great to read a story such as this.'

Another said: 'This is how we should care for the dying, always with dignity and respect. This story made me cry.'
