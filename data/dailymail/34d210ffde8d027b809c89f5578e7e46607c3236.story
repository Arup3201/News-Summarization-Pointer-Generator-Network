Television producers must be scrying into crystal balls, or getting bulletins from next week via Tardis telegrams, because the TV  schedules have been uncannily prescient lately.

First there was a major drama about the Great Train Robbery that began screening on the day that Ronnie Biggs died. Then Nigella Lawson’s new food show was boosted by the most notorious trial for years.

And last night, as Britain was mopping up after appalling storms, Midsomer St Claire was threatened by floods and the villagers were taking sanctuary in the parish church. The river was bursting its banks and, this being Midsomer, it was raining bodies.

Psychopathic version of the Archers: Neil Dudgeon, right, as DCI John Barnaby in the country cop drama

Midsomer Murders (ITV) is a  psychopathic version of The Archers. It’s a world of bicycling maiden aunts and farmers with twine knotted round their trouser legs, bucolic and quaint and steeped in blood.

Because the show is timeless, it seemed odd to have it topical. Villagers were filling sandbags and panic-buying tins of beans in the  village shop; as the downpour intensified, they scurried to the church for life-preserving mugs of chicken soup, and hymns led by a retired vicar.

He was a serial killer, of course, but he preached a lively sermon and joined the congregation in a rousing chorus of Abide With Me. Mass murderer or not, the old-fashioned C of E clergyman is always a reassuring figure.

Michael Jayston, who long ago played George Smiley’s loyal junior in the classic spy serial Tinker  Tailor, was the vengeful vicar. His successor was Rebecca Front, who has a grand repertoire of heavy stares and sour scowls; she is the Chief Superintendant in Lewis, of course, but she ought to be starring in her own crime series.

Front can inject an overdose of saccharine into the nastiest lines, which masks the aggression in her characters. Surveying a medieval fresco in the crypt of her church, she remarked: ‘Isn’t it beautiful? All that misery and suffering, almost makes me tingle.’

That sweetly voiced cruelty would make her formidable in the police interview room. As a female Morse, she could be terrific.

Neil Dudgeon has been Midsomer’s chief detective since 2010; he might want to investigate just where the series is set. The locals come from all over the place — the shopkeeper’s son and the ex-vicar’s daughter had strong hints of the Peak  District in their accents, but the farmer’s drunken son who lived  only a mile away sounded more Devonian than a Dartmoor pony.

House Of Cards, the political drama starring Kevin Spacey as a satanic U.S. senator, returns next month for a second series, but again it will be available only via streaming internet service Netflix.

‘Democracy is so over-rated,’ purrs Spacey.

It’s wonderful viewing, but is it television?

Even more West Country, the men of the Polperro Fisherman’s Choir were chanting the shipping forecast like a liturgy in their rich Cornish voices, on another timely programme about the weather, Hurricanes And Heatwaves (BBC4).

This documentary, part of the excellent Timeshift series, charted the evolution of the weather  forecast, from its invention by  Victorian scientist Robert Fitzroy — who got it wrong so often that he eventually felt compelled to kill himself, by way of apology.

The BBC introduced forecasts in the mid-Fifties, after a bout of extreme weather left 34 dead in the Devon village of Lynmouth. Amid the debris, one resident calmly described to the cameras with an almost poetic clarity how he had seen floodwater wash away houses that ‘folded like a pack of cards’ and ‘the agonising screams of some of the local inhabitants, whom I knew very well’.

The first TV forecaster was  castigated by the Met Office for his amiable delivery: George Cowling drew his own weather maps, and liked to advise viewers when to hang out their washing or take a brolly to work.

At least he didn’t do it like Jeremy Paxman, who was required to read the forecast at the end of Newsnight, as an experiment in 2005. Paxo thought such mundanities beneath his considerable  dignity, and his voice dripped with contempt as he announced: ‘In the afternoon there will be rain, except in places where there isn’t.’

Imagine Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock, reading the poem in a Valentine’s greeting card, and you’ll have half of the sarcastic fury Paxman mustered for  tomorrow’s temperatures. Let’s hope we never hear him recite the shipping forecast.
