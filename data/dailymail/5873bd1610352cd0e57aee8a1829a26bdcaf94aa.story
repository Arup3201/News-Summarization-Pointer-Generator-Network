A college basketball player battling terminal brain cancer saw her jersey number  retired this weekend as she played in one of her final games.

Lauren Hill, 19, who plays for the Mount St. Joseph Division III Cincinnati team, told crowds gathered at Baldwin Wallace University in Ohio on Friday night that she was 'speechless' as  the retirement ceremony took place.

The 5ft 10in freshman was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), last year and her mother reported this month that her condition has worsened with memory loss and vertigo kicking in.

But last week Hill appeared in high spirits as she joined teammates on court.

The former prom queen even managed to score her third career basket in the match against Bethany College.

A message on her Facebook fundraising page read: 'Legs were not working the best but she got the shot on the first try and was super excited. Made her day.'

A banner with Hill's No. 22 jersey was unveiled at the half-time point and Lawrenceburg's mayor declared there would be a Lauren Hill Week in the southeastern Indiana city.

'All this has been amazing and the continued support from everybody, and all the other teams, and the community,' Hill told the crowd. 

'There's really good people out there, that I've learned, and I'm speechless.' 

Lawrenceburg girls basketball coach Zane White said those at the school will be inspired by Hill wherever they go.

'It's an honor to know Lauren and be able to do this for her,' he said.

The Layup4Lauren challenge has helped raise more than $350,000 in the last few weeks for cancer research. 

More than 10,000 people attended Hill's Mount St. Joseph game on November 2 against Hiram College, where she fist fulfilled her dream of playing college basketball and made two layups.

Hill wrote on Facebook last Thursday that she is now focused on spending time with her friends and family and limiting the number of interviews she does. 

She added: 'My body is growing more tired even though I don't sleep well. My brain just has a hard time turning off.'
