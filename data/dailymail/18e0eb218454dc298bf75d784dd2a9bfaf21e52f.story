Raunchy music videos by the likes of Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke should have a ratings system, campaigners have said.

Rewind&Reframe are launching a petition calling for the government to give pop videos cinema-style ratings to stop the sexualisation of young girls.

The campaign group will also launch a website tomorrow which will allow girls to blog and comment on the images of women they see music videos.

Campaigners are launching a petition to have cinema-style age ratings put on raunchy music videos form the likes of Miley Cyrus

Speaking to The Observer Justine Roberts, founder of the website Mumsnet, said: 'I can't see any reason why these videos wouldn't be classified in the way that other forms of media are but the truth is that it won't be a silver bullet.

'Technology these days makes it pretty nigh on impossible to stop under-18s viewing and sharing this kind of material so as parents it's important to talk to them about what's wrong with it.

'As a society we need to consider how we've got to a situation where misogyny and racism is so commonplace.'

Columnist Caitlin Moran has also waded into the debate, saying that teenage girls are being force-fed the idea that all they should aspire to is 'being hot', while Jo Heywood, the headteacher of Â£30,000-a-year Heathfield School, an all-girls college, called on parents and teachers to provide more positive role models for teenagers.

Robin Thicke's video for chart-topping single Burred Lines has also come in for criticism with activists saying the lyrics amounted to an incitement of rape

Tomorrow evening MP Claire Perry, David Cameron's adviser on childhood, will use a debate in the House of Commons to call for a ratings system, as well as for all airbrushed photos to be clearly labelled.

However, at Mumsnet's annual Blogfest debate yesterday disability campaigner Victoria Wright, star of Chanel 4's Cast Offs, argued against banning such viedos, saying it would make them more attractive to teenagers.

She added: 'These highly sexualised images are a distraction from some great songs and it's really worrying. It's always women in skimpy clothes shaking their arses around men standing about in suits.'

Labour MP Stella Creasy said: 'One third of girls say they have experienced some sort of sexual harassment at school.

'Above all, we need to teach our young 
people to be critical of what is age appropriate and we want them to be 
critical of these images and these videos of young sexualised women.

'They need to challenge the view that it is OK.'

The campaign has been launched in the same week that a survey revealed a third of parents have found their children copying 'porn style dance moves'

The comments come in the same weeks that a survey revealed that four fifths of parents have caught children repeating offensive words in pop songs and a third have caught youngsters acting out 'porn style dance moves'.

The online poll also showed that two-thirds of parents feel their children were exposed to unhealthy images on pre-watershed shows such as the X Factor.

In 2012 Reg Bailey, a government adviser, called for a rating system to be applied for music videos in a report to David Cameron.
