A grandfather has celebrated his 100th birthday by jumping out of a plane - but only after getting a doctor to say he was fit enough.

Vernon Maynard is believed to be one of the oldest people to ever complete a tandem skydive after he leapt from 13,000ft yesterday.

He was joined by his two great nephews and trained instructors for the jump near Los Angeles, California.

Vernon Maynard marked his 100th birthday by jumping out of a plane at 13,000ft with instructor James Perez

It was organised by his friends after he told them it was the only thing he wished he had done in his long life.

The retired car dealer, who is originally from Nebraska but lives in Palm Desert, had to provide a doctor's note to Skydive Perris before he was allowed to jump.

Mr Maynard told The Press Enterprise: 'I am just tickled to death and very appreciative that my friends helped put this together.'

Despite his age, Mr Maynard said he was not nervous at all.

His daughter Linda Hironimus said her father has 'no fear'.

When he was 65, he jumped from the second storey of a cruise ship into shark infested waters, he told the website.

The experience was organized by his friends after he said it was the one thing he wished he had done in his life

The grandfather was joined by friends and family for the celebration, who waited on the ground until he landed.

He did a 44 second free fall with James Perez, the company's chief skydiving instructor, who said Mr Maynard is the oldest person he has ever jumped with in his career.

Mr Maynard's granddaughter Lisa Ruggiero burst into tears when he landed safely.

She told the website: 'This is simply amazing. My grandfather is
the most positive and energetic person I have ever met.'

Mr Maynard is one of the oldest men to ever complete a tandem skydive.

He matches the efforts of Fred Mack, who also jumped from 13,000ft to celebrate his 100th birthday in 2011 in New Jersey.
