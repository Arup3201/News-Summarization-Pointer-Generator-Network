Republican Scott DesJarlais, pictured with his second wife Amy, told an 11-year-old girl that the law would be upheld in the deportation of her father

A Republican congressman told a little girl in front of an audience that her father should be deported as members of the crowd cheered.

The 11-year-old girl stood up in front of a Tennessee, US, town hall meeting and asked: 'I have a dad, and he’s undocumented, what can I do so that he can stay with me?'

But she was told by Republican Scott DesJarlais that the immigration laws would be upheld.

He said: 'Thank you for being here and thank you for coming forward and speaking. This is a big intimidating crowd and appreciate you coming forward and asking your question, but the answer still kinda remains the same.

'We have laws, and we need to follow those laws and you know, that’s where we’re at,' he said.

As he spoke at the Murfreesboro event, Tennessee, the little girl sat down and hung her head. Around her members of the audience cheered and whooped at the congressman's response.

The exchange was captured on a low quality camera and footage was posted on rawstory.com. 

The little girl, named Josie Molina, was speaking at Rutherford County Tea Party’s 'Conservative Conversation and Cocktails' meeting, the news service said, which was attended by around 200 people.

Rawstory claimed the congressman made no attempt to 'assuage the girl's fears' and pointed out that the child was in therapy to try to cope with the stress ans anxiety of dealing with losing her father.

Comments on the website mostly show dismay for the congressman's 'heartless' response. One person questioned why the politician didn't reply by telling her what steps her father needed to take to apply for a visa. Others claim the girl was wheeled out as part of a political stunt.

The far right congressman says on his website that he believes illegal immigration 'burdens taxpayers, compromises national security, increases criminal activity, and erodes the significance of being an American citizen'.

He adds: 'We must secure our border and devote resources to enforcing current immigration law, which includes partnering with state and local law enforcement organizations.'

The pro-life republican, a former physician, was re-elected in Tennessee in 2012 despite fending off charges before he entered politics that he impregnated a 24-year-old mistress - one of his patients - and pressured her into having an abortion.

His first wife also had two abortions, according to divorce records. During those proceedings, DesJarlais said one case was related to a drug his wife took for a pituitary gland disorder; the medication was not considered safe for pregnant women.

On his campaign website, the politician takes a firm stance on abortion. He says: 'All life should be cherished and protected. We are pro-life.'
