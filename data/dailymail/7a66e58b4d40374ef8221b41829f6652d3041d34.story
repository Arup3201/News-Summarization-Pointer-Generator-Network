Challenges: Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith

Giving more benefits to poor families will not address child poverty because too many irresponsible parents will spend it on alcohol or drugs, Iain Duncan Smith has warned.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said parental addiction – not family income – had emerged as the main factor in determining a child’s life chances.

He insisted that the last government’s strategy of spending more than £170billion in additional welfare payments had failed comprehensively.

Mr Duncan Smith said giving the family ‘an extra pound in benefits’ can even push them further into difficulty if the cash is used to fuel a parent’s dependency on alcohol or drugs.

In a speech today, he will suggest broader ways of calculating child poverty – including whether or not parents are in work, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt, gambling and poor health.

The Government is also planning new back-to-work programmes tailored specifically for benefit claimants with alcohol and drug problems.

In remarks ahead of the speech, the Work and Pensions Secretary said Labour had ‘spent an unprecedented amount of money in their pursuit of child poverty targets, with some £170billion paid out in tax credits alone’ – but still missed their aim of halving child poverty.

‘Good intentions failed to translate into effective policies because the root causes of poverty cannot be solved by simply giving people a few more pounds in their pocket each week,’ he said.

‘Money matters, of course, and must remain central to our understanding of what it means to be in poverty. But there is now a broad agreement that simply calculating whether people sit above or below the relative income line does not do enough to reflect the reality of their lives.

‘How we measure poverty needs to expose the real challenges we face – however ugly and uncomfortable.’

Labour enshrined its measure of poverty – 60 per cent of median earnings – in law, and used tax credits to try to push families just over the line.

It set a target to reduce the number of children living in relative income poverty to 1.7million by 2010/11, but only got the figure down to 2.3million.

In the Coalition’s first year there was a reduction of 300,000. Ministers admit this was not because incomes rose for the poorest, but was largely due to a significant drop in the median income, demonstrating the absurdity of the current measure.

Claimants of means-tested state benefits should be paid through cards that stop them spending on gambling or alcohol, a Left-leaning think-tank said yesterday.

Pre-paid cards would increase equality by giving claimants a similar ability to use shops as people with chip-and-pin bank cards, the Demos report said. They would encourage responsible money management, and reward saving.

Families on benefits could put a weekly cap on their spending or hold back a set figure from their money to pay rent.

They could also have cards that would not work in betting shops or on gambling websites, or let them buy drink.

Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke has tabled a ten minute rule bill that would stop benefit cash being used to buy cigarettes, alcohol, subscription TV or for gambling.

‘It is trying to help the poorest in society be able to manage their money better,’ he told Radio 4’s Today programme.

The Coalition has agreed to tear up Labour’s definition, insisting that basing it purely on a crude measure of family income is perverse, when other factors can be just as critical in determining children’s life chances.

Mr Duncan Smith said government polling showed people think having a parent addicted to drugs or alcohol is the most important factor for a child growing up in poverty.

He added: ‘I’m by no means saying that every child in poverty will have drug or alcohol addicted parents. But we know the havoc that living with addiction can cause.’

Mr Duncan Smith said Labour’s approach was a ‘vicious trap’ and had left ‘disturbing number’ of people trapped in poverty.

‘There are around 100,000 people claiming sickness benefits whose illness is primarily down to their drug or alcohol addiction,’ he said. ‘Of these, 23,000 have been claiming incapacity benefits for a decade or more. Instead of propping people up on benefits, we need to tackle the root cause of their hardship – the drug addiction itself.’

One pilot scheme for addicted claimants will offer a financial incentive to support addicts who are in rehab, using work as a ‘stepping stone to recovery’. The second will bring in specialists to help others back to work.

Labour MPs accuse the Government of changing the goalposts to mask the impact of its austerity policies. And Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ‘Children are much more likely to be in poverty today because they have a parent who is a security guard, care worker or cleaner than a drug addict or “feckless”.

‘It’s right that the Government focuses on the damage that parental addiction can do to children, but a mistake to mix that up with poverty.’
