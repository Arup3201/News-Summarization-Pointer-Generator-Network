Author JK Rowling has helped to design a charm bracelet that will be sold at auction for charity.

The piece of jewellery is called the Lumos Maxima after a spell mentioned in the Harry Potter books in which at the flick of a wand a light is emitted that floats for several minutes.

It is expected to fetch in the region of £20,000 when it is sold at Sotheby's on December 10 - proceeds from which will go to her charity, Lumos.

The 'Lumos Maxima' charm bracelet, designed in part by J K Rowling, is expected to reach £20,000 when it is auction next week

The books and films not only made stars of actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, but also inspired a whole generation to read

The charm bracelet features several significant aspects of the film including Harry's scar, glasses and broomstick.

There is also a golden snitch from the game quidditch, a Dark Mark skull with amethyst eyes, a Slytherin locket, a winged key, the Tales of Beedle the Bard book, the sorting hat, the Deathly Hallows symbol and a wand which acts as the fastener.  The 12th charm, the butterfly, is the logo of Lumos.

Handcrafted
by Edinburgh jeweler Hamilton & Inches, each charm
is cast in sterling silver before being finished by hand with gold highlights
and precious stones.

The
bracelet has been made to mark the five year anniversary since the publication
of The Tales of Beedle the Bard which was sold in aid of Lumos and the idea of
a bracelet came from the gift Rowling was given by her editors upon the
publication of the final Harry Potter book.

The charm that is most precious is the 12th one -
the butterfly, which is decorated with moonstones and amethysts  and is the logo of the Lumos charity.

Each new book or film release has seen thousands of fans queuing for hours, often overnight, in all kinds of weather, to be one of the first to get the next hit of the franchise, and no doubt this one-of-a-kind bracelet will ignite similar passion.

The piece is being sold as part of Sotheby’s English Literature, History, Children’s Books and
Illustrations sale to with 100 per cent of the profits going to 
benefit Lumos, the children’s charity J.K. Rowling founded in 2005.

Lumos
aims to end the systematic institutionalisation of children, a harmful 
practice that affects 8 million children worldwide, 1 million of whom 
are in Europe – many separated from their families and placed in so 
called ‘orphanages’ as a result of poverty, disability and 
discrimination.

J. K. Rowling set up the charity Lumos in 2005 to help end the systematic institutionalisation of children

The bracelet features 12 charms, 11 of which depict a significant image from the magical world of the Harry Potter series, including Harry's scar (far left) and a wand (far right)
