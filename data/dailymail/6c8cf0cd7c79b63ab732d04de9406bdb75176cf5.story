A school caretaker drilled holes into swimming pool changing rooms to watch high school girls naked in the showers, a court heard today.

Nigel French, 51, was allegedly caught by a PE teacher on all fours above the girls changing room after a swimming lesson.

And the teacher found a hole drilled in the floor directly above a shower cubicle in the girls changing rooms - and a ceiling tile moved to allow a clear view.

Teacher John Davies spotted caretaker French’s feet poking out the end of a stack of gym mats in the storage room overlooking the changing rooms.

He said: 'I saw part of his feet sticking out towards the back end and I wondered what was going on.

'I could see somebody was in a semi prone position. He pushed his head above the mats and then quickly ducked back down.'

Mr Davies went back to the pool where he had a clear view of the caretaker on all fours.

He said he often saw French, a caretaker at the school for 21 years, hanging around the viewing gallery next to the pool.

Eight more drill holes were discovered - this time over the boys changing rooms which had years earlier been for the girls.

Prosecutor Suzanne Thomas said: 'It was likely the holes above the boys changing room were done some years ago.'

The
caretaker at first claimed he was looking for bats above the changing 
rooms at Pen y Dre High School in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard three bats had been found dead in the swimming pool area over the past three years.

'I wasn’t spying on pupils in the pool because that would be wrong that would.'

But none had ever been found in the viewing gallery and there was no evidence of bats nesting in the school.

French, who has around-the-clock access to the swimming pool and school, said he was waiting for the class to finish before cleaning the pool.

The former Scout leader in police interview said: 'I was lying on the gym mats over the girls changing rooms. Basically my only offence could be skiving.

'I went up to the viewing gallery and I laid down facing forward, looking at the side of the pool, waiting for the lesson to finish.

'I can’t remember how long I was lying there.

'I wasn’t spying on pupils in the pool because that would be wrong that would.'

French, of Penydarren, Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, denies attempted voyeurism. The trial continues.
