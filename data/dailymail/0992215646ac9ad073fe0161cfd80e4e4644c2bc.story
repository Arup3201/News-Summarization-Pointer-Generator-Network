Two soldiers could face manslaughter charges following the deaths of three Army reservists who died after collapsing from heat exhaustion on an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons, it emerged yesterday.

L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, L/Cpl Edward Maher, 31, and Cpl James Dunsby, 31, died last summer after a 40-mile hike in soaring 29.5C (85F) temperatures.

Witnesses at the time reported seeing soldiers on the training exercise in distress and pleading for water in the Welsh valleys.

L/Cpl Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, and L/Cpl Mayer were pronounced dead that same day but Cpl Dunsby, from Bath, Somerset, died a fortnight later in a Birmingham hospital.

Yesterday a pre-inquest hearing was told the trio died from ‘over-heating’ following the gruelling selection exercise on July 13.

It also emerged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are expected to make a decision on whether to charge two SAS personnel (identified only as 1a and 1b) in charge on the day with gross negligence manslaughter by the end of this month.

Speaking at the hearing, Det Supt Shane Williams from Dyfed-Powys Police said: ‘This is a joint investigation involving the Health and Safety Executive and Dyfed-Powys Police and the investigation focuses on 1a and 1b and focuses on manslaughter gross negligence.

‘There have been 166 statements taken, 95 related to soldiers engaged in the activities on that day in July.

‘At this moment in time we have the final statement from the pathologist who provided the cause of death of the three individuals.

‘The CPS have decided to engage a further expert in heat exhaustion and he has supplied a 53-page paper.

‘A decision will made whether we will prosecute 1a and 1b by no later than June 28.’

The families of the three soldiers who attended the pre-inquest at Solihull Council House were also told the causes of their loved ones’ deaths for the first time.

Louise Hunt, the coroner for the City of Birmingham and the Borough of Solihull, said that Cpl Dunsby had died from ‘multi-organ failure as a result of hyperthermia’.

She added that L/Cpl Roberts and L/Cpl Maher both had died from ‘the effects of hyperthermia’.

Deciding that the three-week inquest would be held without a jury on October 20, Mrs Hunt added: ‘If we were to have a jury it would certainly take a lot longer.

‘The complex nature of the expert evidence is likely to be difficult for a jury to grapple with.

‘We have a lot of technical matters to deal with in terms of the army and the SAS structures.’

The coroner then adjourned the hearing for another pre-inquest review which is due to be held in Birmingham on August 19.

Cpl Dunsby’s widow Bryher looked tearful during proceedings and as she left the hour-long hearing.

The soldier’s father Joseph was also present along with L/Cpl Maher’s parents and L/Cpl Roberts’s parents and sister.

Representatives of the Ministry of Defence, the Health and Safety Executive and Dyfed-Powys Police were also in attendance.

The three soldiers died after collapsing during the military exercise on south Wales’ highest mountain Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons on July 13 – one of the hottest days of last year.

L/Cpl Roberts was pronounced dead on the mountain at 5.15pm, while L/Cpl Maher died at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil almost three hours later.

Cpl Dunsby died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham two weeks later on July 30.

It is believed the trio were taking part in the gruelling ‘Fan Dance’ which involves marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle.

They then have to do the route in reverse in a set time as they march from checkpoint to checkpoint against the clock.

The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training.

Its rugged and sprawling terrain is said to help prepare soldiers physically and mentally for warfare, as well as putting their logistic skills to the test.
