When readers hungrily flicked through the pages of a top selling children's book they thought they were reading the work of a little old lady called Mrs Hilda Poppitt.

But yesterday the real identity of the author was revealed, and somewhat surprisingly she turned out to be a teenage girl.

Lilly Say, 17, began penning her debut novel as part of a homework assignment when she was just 11 years old under the pen name 'Mrs Hilda Poppitt' - inspired by her favourite sweets 'Poppets'.

Lilly’s children’s book ‘SASAATN’ - which stands for Sugar and Spice and All Things Nice - sold 1,000 copies.

Revealed: Lilly Say, 17, penned her debut novel under the pen name 'Mrs Hilda Poppitt' but her true identity has been revealed after being nominated for a top prize

It has now been nominated for a top award for first-time authors - forcing Lilly to reveal her true identity.

Her readers assumed Mrs Poppitt was an OAP - but the author’s real age has now been made public.

Lilly says she hid behind the pen name because she did not want any added pressure.

Talented Lily, from Woodford Green, north London, said: “It made me nervous when it got published but when I saw it, it was amazing.

The truth is out: High school student Lilly Say, (pictured at her book launch) began writing her debut novel for a Year 5 homework assignment, when she was just 11 years old

'It didn’t feel like it was mine, it looked like a real book that you would buy in a book shop.

'The publisher had an aunt called Hilda and we were eating Poppets sweets at the time and Hilda Poppitt was born. I liked it, it sounds like a little old lady.

Novel: The book, aimed at children aged seven to 11, was released last year to critical acclaim, and is now on the shortlist for a People's Book Award

'It was nice to use a pen name because it meant that I could concentrate on my schoolwork.'

The book, aimed at children aged seven to 11, was released last year to critical acclaim, and is now on the shortlist for a People’s Book Award.

Lily is in her final year at Trinity Catholic High School near her home, and is already working on her second book in the three-part series.

She said: 'I have always made up stories for my little sisters when they are going to bed and read books to them.

'I have got quite a big imagination and it sort of goes off on a tangent and then I tell my sisters when I get back.'

SASAATN, is an adventure story about Lilly and her sisters stumbling across the entrance to a secret world, at exactly 3:30pm on a Wednesday.

The fantastical adventure is full of chance meetings with unusual characters, strange goings-on and funny situations.

The £4.99 novel, published by Puppy Print, has already sold about 1000 copies and has been shortlisted for the People’s Book Prize Spring 2014.
