On 18 April 2014 a Nasa spacecraft was sent crashing into the far side of the moon.

This was on purpose as the mission came to a close, but scientists had struggled to actually find out where it hit the surface.

Now, in new images, the impact site has been revealed in the form of a new crater on the moon.

The images reveal a crater caused by the impact of Ladee (shown). Around the crater ejected material can be seen thrown out on the surface. Ladee crashed into the moon on 18 April 2014 after six months in orbit. The images were captured by the LRO spacecraft that is still in orbit

The crater is believed to have been created by the impact of the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (Ladee) spacecraft on 18 April 2014.

Launch: Sept. 6, 2013

Launch site: Wallops Flight Facility, Virgina

Launch vehicle: Minotaur V

Planned mission duration: 100 days

Actual mission duration: 128 days

Mass: 844 lbs (383 kg)

Power: 295 watts

Cost: £167 million ($280 million)

Mission legacy: Ladee identified various components of 
the thin lunar atmosphere.

It also studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon, created by all the 
surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites.

Scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions?

Ladee also hosted Nasa’s first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves.

It was spotted by Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which has orbited the moon since 2009.

The crater was hard to spot because the impact energy of Ladee was not particularly high compared to, say, a large meteorite.

To perform the impact the spacecraft had been slowly lowered in its orbit and, and the time of crashing, was travelling about 3,800 mph (6,000 km/h).

While that might seem fast, in cosmic terms it is relatively slow compared to meteorite impacts.

This meant the actual crater the impact created was small.

In order to find the crater, scientists used images taken before and after the impact.

By dividing the before image by the after image they were able to spot changes to the surface.

In this instance the ejected material from the impact forms a triangular pattern that extends up to about 1,000 feet (300 metres) from the impact site.

Ladee’s engines fired on 11 April 2014, to perform a final orbital maintenance maneuver and adjust to guarantee it would impact on the farside of the moon and away from the Apollo landing sites.

Over a seven-day period, Ladee’s orbit decreased and the spacecraft orbited very low to the surface and close to the walls of lunar craters and mountain ridges to give the team a chance to collect valuable science data.

Finally, Ladee impacted the eastern rim of Sundman V crater on April 18.

The impact site is about half a mile (780 meters) from the crater rim with an altitude of about 8,500ft (2,590 meters).

It was only about two tenths of a mile (300 meters) north of the location mission controllers predicted based on tracking data.  

'As it turns there were several small surface changes found in the predicted area of the impact, the biggest and most distinctive was within 968 feet (295 meters) of the spot estimated by the Ladee operations team,' said Mark Robinson, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) principal investigator from Arizona State University in Tempe.

'I'm happy that the LROC team was able to confirm the Ladee impact point,' added Butler Hine, Ladee project manager at Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.

'It really helps the Ladee team to get closure and know exactly where the product of their hard work wound up.'
