A teenage girl was used as a human shield by two masked, armed men who tried to forced their way into her home on Monday.

The 17-year-old had been fetching items from her car outside her home in St Louis, Missouri around 11pm when the two men grabbed her, put a gun to her head and forced her up to the front door as a human shield.

The girl's father, 34, saw the men approaching with his teen daughter and grabbed his own gun to fire shots at them from the home where a five-year-old boy was also present.

The father shot and killed one robber and wounded the second man as they came through the front door.

The girl's mother, also 34, fired shots using her gun but did not hit either man, stltoday.com reported.

The family has not been identified but the circuit attorney's office told MailOnline today that no one in the family has been charged with any crime. No one in the family sustained any injuries.

Terrell Johnson, 31, was pronounced dead at the scene while the second suspect Cortez McClinton, 33, suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and thighs.

He fled the scene and was taken to hospital by his brother to be treated.

McClinton has been charged with second-degree murder, kidnapping, burglary and armed criminal action. Bail was set at $1million.

The accused had been released from 
jail last January after a murder case against him collapsed due to lack 
of witnesses.

McClinton allegedly shot dead Bryan Reed, 28, who was sitting in a car in St Louis on April 24, 2010. The 33-year-old has prior convictions for drugs and vehicle tampering.

The investigation is ongoing.
