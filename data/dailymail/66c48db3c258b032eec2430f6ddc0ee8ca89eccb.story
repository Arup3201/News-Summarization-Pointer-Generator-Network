A Delta Airlines plane had a lucky escape after part of its wing broke off during a flight from Florida to Georgia, it emerged today.

Passengers on board Flight 2412, from Orlando to Atlanta, were shocked when they looked out of the window to see a large panel missing from the wing, exposing a tangle of wires and hydraulic machinery to the elements.

Within minutes of a passenger spotting the damage, the pilot of the Boeing 757 decided to make an emergency landing.

The detached panel, however, did not impact the aircraft’s ability to fly or land, Delta spokesman Anthony Black said.

He added: 'The crew, knowing that, followed procedure by declaring an emergency to air traffic control as they were landing, which gave them priority clearance to land and alerted ground crews.'

Crew members declared an emergency, but the plane landed safely and no one was hurt, according to ABC News.

'All the passengers were remarkably calm,' passenger David Watterson told ABC News.

The aircraft landed at 7:30 pm on Sunday at Atlanta International Airport and taxied to the gate. None of the 179 passengers and six crew members aboard the flight was injured.

The airline is inspecting the plane to determine why the panel came off.
