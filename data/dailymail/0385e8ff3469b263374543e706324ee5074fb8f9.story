Too bewildered and dehumanised to show any emotion, a dozen young faces peer out from a world beyond comprehension.

Witnesses to unfathomable depths of human savagery, these are among the last occupants of history’s most infamous slaughterhouse.

To stand in the Arctic chill of Auschwitz today, it seems extraordinary that anyone survived what unfolded here. 

Yet, astonishingly, most of the people in this photograph – taken exactly 70 years ago today – are still alive. What’s more, four of them – including a victim of the abominable human vivisectionist, Dr Josef Mengele – have returned to Auschwitz to mark the 70th anniversary of the day that Soviet troops liberated this place.

January 27 is the date the world recognises as Holocaust Memorial Day.

And around 100 survivors will gather here this afternoon, alongside world leaders, to remember all of the 6million Jewish victims of Nazi Germany’s trans-contintental programme of industrial genocide.

Having beaten such insuperable odds to stay alive, it is a solemn sense of obligation to both past and future generations which has persuaded this small, heroic band to make this painful return journey for today’s anniversary.

Ahead of the ceremonies, there have been some extraordinary and deeply moving scenes here, not least a reprise of that famous liberation photograph by Red Army photographer Alexander Vorontsov.

After extensive detective work, the California-based Shoah Foundation, created by director Steven Spielberg, has tracked down the names of nearly all those in the photo to arrange this week’s reunion.

Eva Kor was a few days short of her eleventh birthday when the Soviets suddenly arrived, along with Vorontsov and his ‘huge’ cameras. ‘We couldn’t believe that we really were free,’ Eva tells me. ‘So we kept walking out of the gate and then back in again. To do that without being shot – well, that was such a feeling of freedom that I still do it when I come back all these years later.’

At 80, she is a magnificent monument to the power of positive thought, proudly rolling up her sleeve to show me her prison number – A-7063 – tattooed on her arm. ‘People ask why I didn’t get it removed. Well, I paid a high price for this!’

Eva owes her survival to the fact she arrived from Hungarian-occupied Romania in 1944 with her twin sister, Miriam. Most Jewish children too small for slave labour would be taken straight to the gas chambers but the camp doctor, Mengele, had issued special orders for twins.

They were needed for his gruesome medical research. The ten-year-old sisters were dragged from the family they would never see again and the experiments began almost immediately.

‘Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we had hours of measurement of every part of our bodies – so demeaning,’ says Eva matter of factly. ‘Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, I had five injections in my right arm and, to this day, I have no idea what was in them.’

On one occasion, she was left so ill she heard Mengele tell medical staff she would be dead in a fortnight. ‘I was only ten but all I could think was “I am not going to let Mengele win”.’ She pulled through.

There was another incentive. Once one twin was dead, the other was superfluous to requirements and would be executed. Eva had to stay alive to save Miriam. Weeks later, she risked hanging to steal two potatoes from the kitchens for her sister. ‘Miriam had dysentery and I thought the only way to keep her alive was to get her potatoes.’

Having returned home after the war, the sisters found rampant anti-semitism – ‘there were local rumours about Jewish vampires; people believed them’ – and emigrated to Israel before, finally, moving to the USA.

Miriam died in 1993, but not before returning with Eva in 1985. ‘You know the first thing we did? We went and touched the barbed wire to feel what it was like not to be electrocuted.’ 

Eva still has one burning ambition. ‘There must be files somewhere saying what was in those injections which Mengele gave me. I have to find out.’

Every survivor has some sort of heartbreaking unfinished business here. Beneath one of the 20th Century’s most despicable lies, Mordechai Ronen is consumed with grief. ‘I don’t ever want to come back here ever again!’ he shrieks. ‘Ever!’

The first time he saw the gates of Auschwitz, he was a bewildered 11-year-old from Romania.

Now, at the age of 82, this founding father of the state of Israel is once again standing beneath the infamous archway to Auschwitz and its grotesque slogan: ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ – ‘Work Brings Freedom’. Though it is the third time Mr Ronen has been back here since the war, every attempt to articulate his feelings is quashed by emotion.

But he doesn’t need to say a thing. For 1.1million people, including most of Mr Ronen’s family, Auschwitz meant death. For many others, this dismal railway town in southern Poland was an horrific transit point on the way to being murdered somewhere else – in a labour camp or on a ‘death march’ to another prison-mortuary. Among the many millions who met their death here were Poles, gypsies and Soviet prisoners of war.

Only 8,000 emaciated prisoners were still inside Auschwitz and its sub-camps when Stalin’s forces arrived in January 1945. The rest – like Mr Ronen – were already being herded across central Europe with just flimsy pyjamas and wooden clogs to protect them against the winter. Most were dead by the time Europe was liberated in May 1945.

Another survivor on a painful quest here is Johnnie Pekats. Having arrived in 1943, his training in his father’s Carpathian barber’s shop landed him with an horrific assignment – shaving women prisoners destined for the gas chambers. He was 15.

After the war, he emigrated to Canada and built a successful hair salon on New York’s Park Avenue. Until this week, he had never been back to Europe, let alone Auschwitz. Now he is here with his son, Todd. 

‘I had to see where my mother and my baby sister were murdered,’ he says, walking slowly but purposefully through the slush to the site of the original Auschwitz gas chamber. ‘And I had to come with the next generation to show them what really happened.’

Today is the first time since Todd was a child that Johnnie has seen his son cry. He himself cannot stem the flow as he stands in the unlit chamber of horrors. ‘You can’t imagine the smell,’ he whispers again and again. ‘My heart is breaking…’

Johnnie keeps asking our guide to show him where his mother and sister might have breathed their last but, as with so much else here, no one can be sure.

No explanation is needed as we walk through Block 4 where the hair of 50,000 prisoners – unearthed by the sackload after liberation – is piled the length of the building.

Next door in Block 5, we see another large glass-fronted display case. As powerful as any words or photograph, it contains thousands of children’s shoes. Johnnie throws up his hands and walks out.

Back at the gate, Johnnie is accosted by a young woman pushing a pram. ‘I am German and all I can say is how sorry I am,’ she says, and presses a tiny flower brooch into his hand. Afterwards, he tries to explain how much it means to him. ‘Such a small thing and such a very big thing…’ And he can find no more words.
