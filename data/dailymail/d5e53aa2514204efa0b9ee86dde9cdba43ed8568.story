A father desperately tried to save his toddler from dying after he found him face down in a paddling pool, an inquest heard.

Harvey Dale was discovered lying in the makeshift pond, made from a paddling pool, in his back garden when he did not respond to his mother's calls for dinner.

His mother Charlotte asked her husband Shane to check on their boy, and when he discovered Harvey, he jumped into the pond to pull his body out of the water.

Mr Dale then performed CPR on his 23-month-old son before paramedics arrived and took him to hospital.

Doctors at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital kept the toddler alive in its intensive care unit for two days before he died of a hypoxic brain injury.

The inquest in Oxford was told the tragedy unfolded in the back garden of a home in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on September 4 last year.

Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter read statements from Harvey’s parents which described the awful moment their boy was discovered.

Charlotte’s read: 'The kids asked to play in the garden. It was a nice sunny evening and I said okay. I called them all for their dinner. All the kids were going in and out.

'I called Harvey at the door and he didn’t come. I told Shane to run and check out the back for him. I saw Shane out the window jumping into the water.'

The 33ins deep former paddling pool had been filled with water and was 24ins deep when the tragedy happened.

Mrs Dale said: 'There was a step on the edge of the pond where he would sit quite often. He liked being in the garden, he used to climb everything.'

Detective Constable Andrew Ryan, of Thames Valley Police, told the inquest: 'When I asked the parents about what he was like as a child they said he was always climbing into things.'

Recording a verdict of accidental death coroner Mr Salter said: 'It is an extremely sad case.

'It seems that Harvey was only out of sight for a short period of time.'

'Clearly it seems to be a tragic accident that occurred in the garden of the home address on September 4 in the late afternoon.'
