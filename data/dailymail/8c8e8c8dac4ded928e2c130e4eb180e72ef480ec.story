Comments: Eric Pickles said any council in England wanting to impose inflation-busting rises of above 2 per cent would have to hold a referendum

Local authorities could force through council tax rises of more than 3 per cent this year by using a legal loophole to defy a Government freeze.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said last month that any council in England wanting to impose inflation-busting rises of above 2 per cent would have to hold a referendum, which would be time consuming and all but impossible to win.

However, Labour-run Rochdale council has agreed a rise of 3.5 per cent from April and insists it has no intention of holding a referendum.

The council’s bosses are being accused of ‘fleecing’ residents because it was revealed they will attempt to use a technicality in the Localism Act by declaring that increases for waste collection and transport can be excluded from the headline rate of council tax increase.

It is feared that many councils will now try to defy the freeze in the same way.

Rochdale Council’s Vicky Crossland confirmed bills would rise by 3.5 per cent overall, but insisted the basic council tax element of the total bill would increase by less than 2 per cent.

She added: ‘We won’t need to hold a referendum for the proposed increase of 3.5 per cent.

‘The legislation which determines how to calculate the relevant basic amount of council tax, excludes the Waste Disposal Levy and the Passenger Transport Levy.’

It is understood that seven other councils in Greater Manchester are considering following suit.

even more money from local taxpayers’.

He added: ‘It is time all local authorities learned from those councillors working hard to deliver lower bills for local taxpayers.

'They shouldn’t follow Rochdale’s dismal example, finding more and more creative ways of fleecing residents.’

The average council tax for a band D household in 2011/12 was £1,439 in England and £1,162 in Wales. A 3.5 per cent increase would add an average of £45.
