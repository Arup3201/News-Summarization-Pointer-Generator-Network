If you’re already impressed by this extraordinarily-lifelike portrait of a man created with more than two million ink dots, then just wait until you hear the story behind it.

Miguel Endara created the image of Benjaman Kyle, who was found unconscious, bloody and naked behind a Burger King dustbin in 2004 in Georgia - with no identification or memory of who he was.

The artist wanted to help Mr Kyle, 64, who suffered from retrograde amnesia - which is forgetting the past before a major event. He got his name from doctors after the fast food chain’s letters ‘B.K.’.

Mr Kyle - the only US citizen listed 
as missing despite his whereabouts being known - cannot obtain a new 
social security number, be taken in by any homeless shelters or even 
take out a library book.

His
identity has baffled the police and FBI, who cannot find his 
fingerprints in databases or his face in missing person files. Director 
John Wikstrom even made a film about him called 'Finding Benjaman'.

After
this he was given a special Florida state identification card, a job at
a restaurant and permission to stay in someon’s air-conditioned shed. 
It was a big improvement from his last bedroom - in a field.

But
despite the attempts of friends he has made along the way while trying 
to find out his story - even appearing on US TV show Dr Phil - Mr Kyle 
still has no idea about his history and family tree.

In detail: It took 138 hours with each dot applied one by one at an average of around four dots per second

‘Basically, I don't exist,’ he told ABC earlier this month. ‘I'm a walking, talking person who is invisible to all the bureaucracy. I don't have any plans for the future. Sometimes I wish I just hadn't woken up.

'You'll find a lot of people who say it's all bogus, that I'm faking it for whatever reason - but one thing's for sure - I'm not getting rich out of it. I'm 64. I'm trying to get on with my life as best as I can.’

One of the only leads he has is two people who believe they met him while working at a Waffle House in Georgia. But despite plenty of offers of help from people, he still knows no more about himself.

Now Mr Endara, who is known for his realistic dot drawings, has decided that through selling prints of the ink dot work for £56 ($90) each, he will help Mr Kyle by giving him half of the proceeds.

The drawing took 138 hours with each dot applied one by one at an average of four dots per second.
