The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside.

Brandan Wright. Less than a month after the Celtics acquired the veteran forward from Dallas in the Rajon Rondo trade, the team moved him on to the Phoenix Suns. 'The Boston Celtics have acquired a future conditional Minnesota first-round pick and a trade exception from the Phoenix Suns in exchange for forward/center Brandan Wright,' the team stated on its website.

He's an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season, and with Boston in rebuilding mode, the team was better off dealing the 27-year-old than letting him leave in the offseason for nothing. Between his time with the Celtics and Dallas Mavericks, the 27-year-old was averaging 7.5 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.3 blocks a game.

Good Week

The DENG Academy. The NBA and the Luol Deng Foundation announced a new partnership that will see the League support this basketball school of excellence run out of Evelyn Grace Academy in Brixton founded by Miami Heat forward Luol Deng. 

The Academy aims to produce elite basketball players to feed into Brixton Topcats Basketball Club of the English League, while providing participation opportunities for up and coming players in the area. 

'The DENG Academy provides a platform to teach the values of the game including health and wellness, teamwork and respect while producing the next generation of home grown talent,' said Deng who was born in South Sudan and became a British citizen in 2006, having moved to London with his family in 1994.

Bad Week

Kevin Garnett. It's safe to say that things got a little heated on Monday night between the Brooklyn Nets and Houston Rockets. Dwight Howard and Kevin Garnett got into it during the first quarter. After some initial pushing, Garnett then threw the ball at Howard, then headbutted him, sparking a fight between the two teams. 

After the dust settled, KG was ejected, while Howard stayed in the game. Unfortunately for the Nets, Garnett's extracurriculars were the high point of the game. Houston got 30 points from James Harden (offsetting a career high 24 from Mason Plumlee) in what turned out to be a walkover win.

Brit Watch

The Milwaukee Bucks take on the New York Knicks at NBA Global Games London 2015 at The O2 on Thursday and in advance of the game, the team brought a British feel to its fans at with the first ever 'London Night' at BMO Harris Bradley Center. 

Special elements for the night included 10,000 adult fans receiving a limited edition football-style Bucks scarf, pre-game entertainment including Rolling Stones and The Who cover bands and Bangers and Mash and Fish and Chips in the concession stands.

And Finally

His physical with the Cleveland Cavaliers just added to the legend that is Timofey Mozgov. The Russian was acquired from the Denver Nuggets and the Cavs apparently ran into a bit of a problem during the physical, but the problem didn't put the trade in jeopardy. 

Actually, the 'problem' should bode well for the team on the court. The Cavaliers had to remove a tile from the ceiling to accommodate their new 7'1' center.
