A speed camera firm which has earned £35 million from British taxpayers since 2006 has paid just £12,000 in UK taxes, accounts for the company have revealed.

RedSpeed International supplies digital traffic cameras designed to stop motorists speeding or driving through red lights both in Britain and overseas.

According to the latest accounts filed with Companies House, the firm, based in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, posted a pre-tax profit of £1.09 million but paid no UK corporation tax.

The company, which is behind a device called SpeedCurb which uses road sensors to measure speed, won a contract late last year to supply 600 speed and red light cameras to Transport for London.

Although it manufactures and maintains the speed camera equipment, the firm has no involvement in the day to day operation of the cameras.

Official paperwork shows during that time he has taken home more than £760,000 in pay.

The managing director lives outside Worcester in a mortgage-free home, which he bought for£975,000 at the age of 29.

Since 2006, RedSpeed International has turned over more than £73 million, including £35 million in the UK, but has paid less than £12,000 in taxes here.

The most recent accounts show a turnover for 2013 of £9.3 million, with more than £3.3 million coming from the UK.

Despite its £1.09 million pre-tax profit, RedSpeed International paid no UK corporation tax - although it did pay nearly £19,000 in foreign corporation tax.

The accounts also revealed that it did not pay any UK corporation tax in 2012, while shelling out £72,565 abroad.

The accounts for 2011, 2010 and 2009 also show a zero  tax charge, with the bill standing at £262 in 2008, £261 in 2007 and £11,239 for 2006.

Campaigner Paul Pearson, of penaltychargenotice.co.uk, said: 'It’s not right these cameras rake in essentially another tax, but the firm behind them does not pay much.' 

When initially approached, a member of staff at RedSpeed replied: 'No comment.'

RedSpeed are yet to respond to MailOnline's further request for comment.
