Stan Wawrinka came through his first real test of the Australian Open on Monday as the defending champion beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in four sets to reach the quarter-finals.

Wawrinka appeared to be cruising to victory but was almost taken to a deciding fifth set by the unseeded Spaniard before he closed out a 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (10-8) victory.

The Swiss said: 'I'm happy to get through. It was important to win that match again. It is great for me to be in the quarter-finals.

'I'm happy the way I'm playing so far. As I said before the tournament, I'm ready for the tournament. My game is there. I didn't spend too much energy on the court in the first week.'

The match was briefly delayed in the early stages as water leaked on to the court from the new roof of the Margaret Court Arena, which had in fact just held its official opening ceremony 45 minutes earlier.

Fourth seed Wawrinka edged a tight first set in the tiebreak and appeared to be coasting towards the finish line at two sets and a break up.

Garcia-Lopez hit back to take the third set - the first set Wawrinka has dropped in the tournament - and had five set points to level the match in the fourth set tiebreak.

However, he could not convert and Wawrinka sealed his passage through to the last eight to set up a clash with Kei Nishikori, who claimed victory in a five-set battle between the pair in the US Open quarter-finals last year.

The Japanese fifth seed was in impressive form on Monday as he beat David Ferrer 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in two hours and seven minutes.

Wawrinka said: 'He's a tough, tough player. He improved a lot last year. He's a great shot maker. He can make winners. He's always taking the ball really early. It's always tough to play against him. He doesn't give you a lot of time

'It will depend a little bit on me, the way I'm going to serve, the way I'm aggressive from the baseline. If I can play heavy, if I can play my game, it's tough for him to always take the ball early.'
