An Ohio teacher has been fired after a black student who said he 
wanted to become president claimed the teacher told him the nation 
didn't need another black commander in chief.

The Fairfield Board 
of Education voted 4-0 on Thursday night to fire science teacher Gil 
Voigt from Fairfield Freshman School, according to The Cincinnati 
Enquirer.

'The district felt that the 
evidence was sufficient to support the termination of Mr. Voigt's 
employment,' Superintendent Paul Otten said in statement.

Freshman science teacher Gil Voigt was fired after telling a black student that he didn't need another black president after Obama

Voigt did not immediately return a call seeking comment Friday but has said the student misquoted him.

Voigt,
 who is white, told school officials that what he actually told the teen
 was that he doesn't think the nation can afford another president like 
Barack Obama, 'whether he's black or white.'

A state referee investigating Voigt found that explanation was not credible.

The
 referee also found Voigt had made other offensive comments in class 
over the years, including an accusation that in 2008, he trained his 
laser pointer at a black student and said he looked like 'an 
African-American Rudolph.'

Voigt told school officials that he was
 only repeating what another student had said but later acknowledged his
 conduct had been inappropriate.

In 2012, Voigt was accused of calling a student stupid and implying that he and some of his classmates were gay.

In
 that incident, Voigt denied making any insulting comments to students 
and told school officials that a group of students in his class were 
colluding against him.

Fairfield school officials said there was sufficient evidence to justify Voigt's removal, and that he had a history of inappropriate behavior

The state referee found Voigt's explanation for those two incidents to also be not credible.

'Voigt
 repeatedly engaged in conduct that is harmful to the well-being of his 
students,' the state referee wrote in an April 11 report given to the 
board of education. 'He has made race-based, culturally based and 
insulting comments to students over a period of years. He was warned on 
multiple occasions that if his behavior continued that he would be 
subject to termination. Unfortunately, for both Voigt and his students, 
he did not alter his conduct.'

Voigt may appeal his firing to a 
Butler County court. The Ohio Department of Education will investigate 
to decide what to do about his teaching license.

Voigt taught in 
Fairfield schools since 2000. He had been on unpaid leave since December
 following a parent's complaint about the Obama remark.
