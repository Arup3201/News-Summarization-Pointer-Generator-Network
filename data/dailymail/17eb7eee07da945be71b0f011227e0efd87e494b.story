Misty Mink is being held on $75,000 bail after being arrested for theft. She collected thousands of dollars to pay for chemotherapy, but doesn't have cancer

Misty Mink collected thousands of dollars from well-wishers to help pay for her chemotherapy bills - the only problem was she didn't have cancer.

Mink, 41, has been jailed in Texas for theft after telling people she had knee cancer and needed help paying bills that her insurance wouldn't cover. 

One of the well-wishers, Michelle Wasicek spent months helping to raise money for Mink after the women met through mutual friends. 

'I feel betrayed and hurt and used,' Wasicek told a local television station. 

'I figured this girl is young and she has a fighting chance, and I would want somebody to help me.'

Wasicek, who herself is battling thyroid disease, attended and hosted benefit fundraiser concerts to help Mink collect $4,000 for her phony bills.

Wasicek would also driver her to treatments. 

Her mother grew suspicious after Mink cut a rug at the most recent sham fundraiser, despite that pesky knee cancer.

'Somebody that's is supposed to be in so much pain and have cancer in her knee, and you're out there dancing? I'm like get for real,' Wasicek's mom Brenda Seal said.

Acting on her mom's suspicions, Wasicek phone Mink's insurance, who insisted they do pay for any cancer treatment. 

She then dialed a number for Mink's supposed treatment hospital and no one had ever heard of the conwoman.

Michelle then started digging. She called Misty's insurance company and then the hospital, and the sham was exposed. She and her mom showed off the paperwork that led to Mink's arrested to a local reporter

Wasicek, who was picking up Mink from MD Anderson, a top cancer hospital, got her and called her bluff. 

'I was fuming... We got back to my apartment and that's when everything hit the fan,' Wasicek said. 

'She's a criminal, a career criminal. Her record shows it what kind of person she is.'

Indeed, criminal records obtained by Click 2 Houston show previous arrests between 2000 and 2006 for five separate crimes, including three arrests for theft by check and one for forgery.

Michelle posted information about Misty's most recent court appearance this week on her Facebook page, encouraging people who wanted to see her jailed to show up and make their voices heard. 

Mink is now being held on $75,000 bond by the Montgomery County Sheriff. Her next court date is August 20th, when she could accept a plea deal.
