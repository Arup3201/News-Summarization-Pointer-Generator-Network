No sooner had Wayne Rooney led by example scoring a sumptuous early nerve-settler against West Ham than he was being branded a pariah for needlessly kicking out at Stewart Downing and getting sent off.

Yet that was already his third goal alongside two assists in the opening six games of this campaign and put him ahead of Thierry Henry – and behind Andy Cole and Alan Shearer – as the third all-time Premier League top-scorer on 176 goals.

United now desperately need Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao to pick up some of the considerable slack that will be left behind in Rooney's absence.

Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie are set to become Man United's first-choice strike partnership with Wayne Rooney suspended for the next three matches following his red card against West Ham on Saturday

Especially as they face tricky matches hosting Everton and Chelsea at Old Trafford and travelling away to West Bromwich Albion without their talisman.

Falcao is yet to score in a United shirt since his £6million loan move from Monaco and Louis Van Gaal needs him to start hitting the back of the net.

There is a reason the 28-year-old's total transfer fees is already £90.2m, which will go well over the £100m mark when United make the move permanent for £45m next summer – in league matches alone he has netted 138 times in 207 starts. That is a stunning rate of a goal every one-and-a-half starts.

Van Persie is beginning to shake off his early-season fatigue from competing in the World Cup with Holland, scoring twice in the past two games.

Rooney had earlier showed his deadly instinct to give United the lead 

Falcao came with great expectations and now United really need him to start performing

His first game back will likely be the Manchester derby at the Etihad on November 2. 

But his scoring rate for this campaign is still just one goal every 203 minutes, something he needs to vastly improve on without Rooney around.

Rooney's ban also provides the chance for Juan Mata to get a foot-hold in the team, as the natural replacement in behind the two strikers.

The Spaniard is becoming the perennially pushed aside – sidelined by Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and now, seemingly, Van Gaal at United – but will surely have his chance to make his mark.

With former club Valencia reportedly waiting in the wings to make a bid in the January transfer window, this could be his last real opportunity to impress.

There are goals and assists in United's wealth of midfield and attacking options; Van Persie, Falcao, Mata, Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Adnan Januzaj.

But where will the fierce bite come from which is at the heart of Rooney's game?

United have already lacked backbone this season, crumbling at Leicester, being brushed aside by League One MK Dons and held at newly-promoted Burnley.

There is no obvious replacement for the screaming, furious passion which resonates from the England forward to the rest of the team.

His international team-mate Steven Gerrard, who he replaced as captain of the national side, described Rooney as a 'natural leader.'

He revealed of their time with England: 'Before a game, he is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room. He wouldn’t be afraid of speaking up and talking to someone one-to-one, telling them what is expected.'

Rooney's absence presents a dilemma for Louis van Gaal and his assistant Ryan Giggs 

Rooney's passion was very much in evidence during United's 5-3 defeat to Leicester 

United are seventh in the Premier League table, eight points behind the leaders Chelsea

Where will that be found in a new team built from £150m spending this summer with a few teenagers being brought into the first-team fold?

Who will call out those not working hard enough in the dressing room at half-time if they're struggling in the next few weeks?

Rooney has apologised for his red card, but it is United who could be sorry to see him on the sidelines instead of at the centre of their team in the next month.

They are already eight points off Chelsea at the top of the table – that gap could be far greater by the time he is back.
