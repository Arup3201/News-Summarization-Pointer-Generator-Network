Tourists in Times Square were not tickled when a man dressed as the innocent, giggly red Muppet Elmo was arrested after apparently going on an anti-Semitic rant.

The man, identified as Adam Sandler, was standing in front of the Toys 'R' Us at the Crossroads of the World yesterday, yelling at passers-by and blocking traffic, according to police.

Sandler had a similar episode over the summer and was taken to a local hospital after people in Central Park found him calling out obscenities and racial epithets.

Not tickled: A man later identified as Adam Sandler (no relation to the actor), dressed as the Muppet character Elmo, is arrested in New York's Times Square yesterday

According to the New York Times, Sandler is a 48-year-old from Ashland Oregon who then moved to Cambodia and founded a pornographic website called Welcome To Rape Camp, and was later deported because of it.

He was arrested today after going on yet another anti-Semitic rant, according to police.

Sandler is not related to the actor and comedian of the same name.

A Reuters photographer caught Sanders being hauled off by two NYPD officers while a crowd of tourists looked on.

Some appeared bemused, others couldn’t seem to make heads or tails out of the strange arrest.

Don't hug me: Sandler has been captured across the city in his furry Elmo suit; a passer-by in Central Park captured this particular rant this past June

Elmo in chains: Sandler, still dressed in his getup, was taken away in handcuffs to receive a psychiatric evaluation

One woman, Sarah Fosom, witnessed Elmo’s arrest. She tweeted: ‘Just watched Elmo go on an anti-Semitic rant, get taken down by cops and arrested in Times Square. You stay classy, New York!’

Ms Fosom followed up with the hashtag #crazytown. 

According to the Times, Sandler’s summer rant led to him being taken to Metropolitan Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. 

He told Times crime scene reporter Michael Wilson, in so many words, that he drew suspicion from anyone who took a picture with him and then refused to tip. 

He wears a blue denim messenger bag around his neck to hold his profits. 

The Times reported that he bought an Elmo costume online for $300, going to Times Square to make a quick buck. Within a day, he said, the costume paid for itself.
