Darren Fletcher is set to leave Manchester United on a free transfer during this January window. 

The 30-year-old, who has featured 12 times for Louis van Gaal's side this season, has had definite offers from Valencia and West Ham - as reported by Sportsmail. 

United will let the Scotland international go for nothing and will pay a contribution to Fletcher's salary but it is still not quite agreed with  West Ham - who are leading the chase for the midfielder's signature.

The Hammers are set to land Fletcher, who also has an offer from West Brom, because his preferred club Valencia have yet to get rid of Bruno Zuculini.

Zuculini, on loan from Manchester City, is no longer wanted at the Spanish club as well as Javi Fuego.   

Upton Park boss Sam Allardyce is hopeful over signing Fletcher, as he looks to seal a European spot next season, as well as Hamilton's 20-year-old left-back Stephen Hendrie.

Meanwhile, the Hammers have extended the trial for Swedish centre-back Marcus Nilsson. 

The 26-year-old spent last week training with Sam Allardyce's first team squad and impressed the coaching staff enough to be invited to stay for another week.  

Nilsson, who has one cap for his country, has recently become a free agent following his release by Kalmar FF.
