The culinary creations of Neanderthals might be a little basic for our modern tastes, but a new study suggests that they could cook up a warm stew – even if they didn’t have any pots or pans.

It has long been known that Neanderthals, who lived around 30,000 years ago, were skilled with fire – and now palaeontologists think they may have invented boil-in-the-bag cuisine.

Experts had thought that Homo sapiens were able to thrive, while Neanderthals died, thanks to their ability to heat up food, but new evidence suggests that Neanderthals boiled their food too.

Boil-in-the-bag: Palaeontologist John Speth thinks that Neanderthals boiled their food in a bag made of skin or a birch bark tray to soften meat. They are known to have been adept at using fires (illustrated)

In January a team of Israeli archaeologists uncovered the site of a large hearth dating to around 300,000 years ago.

The discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in Qesem Cave, an archaeological site near present-day Rosh Ha'ayin in Israel.

Historians have long questioned when humans began to control fire in order to use heat to suit their daily needs and the find hints that prehistoric humans had a highly advanced social structures and intellectual capacity.

A thick deposit of wood ash in the centre of the cave was discovered and infrared spectroscopy used to find that in the ash were specks of bone and soil that had been heated to very high temperatures – ‘conclusive proof’ of a hearth.

The site also contained large numbers of burnt animal bones, which the experts think is further evidence that cave men used fires to cook meat.

The findings build upon other evidence that suggests the organisation of various ‘household’ activities into different parts of the cave, points to an organisation of space and a kind of social order that is typical of modern humans.

Cooking makes certain nutrients and higher levels of fat available to a digestive system compared to some raw foods.

John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, told a meeting at the Society for American Archaeology in Austen Texas: ‘I think it’s pretty likely the Neanderthals boiled’.

His belief is based upon ancient bones and spears National Geographic reported.

Professor Speth thinks that Neanderthals boiled their food in a bag made of skin - likely an animal's paunch - or a bark tray, which would have worked because water will boil at a temperature slightly lower than the one needed to set the material holding it on fire.

‘You can boil in just about anything as long as you take it off the flame pretty quickly,’ he explained.

Animal bones found at sites known to have been used by Neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnawing marks, which suggests that fat had been heated and cooked off. A 2011 study also hints that Neanderthals might have heated grains.

However, other academics are not so sure. Mary Stiner of the University of Arizona in Tucson, said she 
is 'not convinced' that they went as far as boiling food in bags or on bark.

On fire: While evidence of a hearth (marked with arrow) at least 300,000 years old has been found in Israel and is proof that Neanderthals were adept at using fire, most historians agree that the advent of boiling by heating stones and dropping them into water arrived too late for Neanderthals

Neanderthals probably used an animal paunch to make the bags as they only needed to tie off one of the holes and push food inside from one end of the oesophagus, Professor Speth told MailOnline.

To make bark cooking containers, they would have simply folded bark into a shape capable of holding a meaty mixture that wouldn't leak.

Neanderthals were pretty sophisticated when it came to using tools, which could have been made from wood or other perishable materials, Professor Speth explained.

'Unfortunately what preserves to archaeologists is primarily stone tools which are largely the tools (knives, scrapers, and the like) used to make other tools and equipment, the latter made of perishable materials that we seldom see.'

While evidence of a hearth at least 300,000 has been found in Israel and is proof that Neanderthals were adept at using fire, most historians agree that the advent of boiling by heating stones and dropping them into water arrived too late for Neanderthals.

The earliest evidence of stones used in this way dates back 26,000 years when Neanderthals were extinct.

However, there is evidence that Neanderthals made adhesive for their spears from birch tar around 200,000 years ago, so they had good knowledge of the material.

Michael Bisson of Canada’s McGill University told the meeting that making birch tar is complex and requires an oxygen-free vessel, demonstrating that Neanderthals were used to manipulating birch and could have lit cigar-like rolls of bark buried in holes to cook the tar in the correct conditions to prevent it exploding.
