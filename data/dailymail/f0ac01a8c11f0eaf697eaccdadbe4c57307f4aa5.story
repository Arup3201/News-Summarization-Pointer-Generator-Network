Australia's biggest cities could become a new project for the woman who transformed New York's Times Square and overhauled the Big Apple's transport network.

Former New York City transport commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan wants to re-design roads to enable them to become social 'living roonm' instead of being clogged thoroughfares.

Speaking at Adelaide's Velo-Cities conference, Ms Sadik-Khan said the way we think of streets needs to change, recommending Australian cities install more cycle paths and bike-share programs.

Her role as transport commissioner saw her overhaul how New York's footpaths were used and breathe life back into the city by eliminating traffic and creating an environment that encouraged more people to walk.

Despite the success, at the time extensive cycle path networks were rolled out and the bike share system was introduced, they were viewed as controversial, according to the ABC.

'Our streets are where we play and meet, kind of like the living rooms of New York, and so when you change something like that it can cause a stir,' she said.

Sydney has approved plans to close George St to traffic so light rail can be implemented and a large plaza in front of Sydney's Town Hall be created.

When Ms Sadik-Khan proposed closing Times Square there was massive concern, with businesses and theatre-owners anxious and worried as well as general scepticism from the public.

But she continued with her plans, supported by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and went on to transform Times Square in the middle of his re-election campaign.

Creating streets that make it easier to get around and also make the city more attractive for businesses and residents is a key economic-development strategy for the city.

At the end of their terms last December, Ms Sadik-Khan and Mr Bloomberg cut the ribbon on the finished Times Square project.

'It's gorgeous and it is really worthy of its name: the crossroads of the world,' she said.

Ms Sadik-Khan said data proved the renovation worked with retail rents near Times Square tripling, six major retailers opening and Times Square is now rated as one of the top 10 retail locations in the world for the first time.

But Ms Sadik-Khan said it was not all smooth sailing and that implementing the massive changes saw her become a target of the press and said reading the tabloid papers was not 'fun'.

But New York now has a network of predominately separated paths covering and connecting the all of the city's boroughs.

It has has privately operated bike share program, albeit reportedly facing financial problems, which operates with an annual membership and is available to tourists.

Ms Sadik-Khan said roads need to be thought of as social 'living rooms'

The Don't Be a Jerk safety campaign features some of the city's most famous comedians, models and chefs riding bikes in a bid to encourage cyclists to respect their fellow riders.

But the former transport commissioner said leadership at a local level is where she sees most of the innovation in urban design taking place.

'It's interesting to see that the innovation that you see in cities like Sydney, Adelaide and Auckland and in New York City ... it's the cities that are innovating,' she said.

She said it was common to not see funding and policy guidance at national (federal) level.

Ms Sadik-Khan is now an adviser to a national transportation association that develops cooperative approaches to key transportation issues.

Part of the former transport commissioner's strategy for implementing plans was to act quick

Speaking about the Times Square project, Ms Sadik Khan said families with kids would be crunched onto fire hydrants and that even parking signs were complicated.

She acted quickly, temporarily closing sections of road and car parks and marking where a new plaza might be built.

The plans, including curb lines, were painted all over the city and Ms Sadik-Khan added the key was to change the use of a space quickly so people could see what it looked like.

She did this in areas where residents and business wanted public space and if anyone did not like it, it could be changed it back.

Despite initial fears form businesses and the public, Ms Sadik-Khan said Times Square was flourishing
