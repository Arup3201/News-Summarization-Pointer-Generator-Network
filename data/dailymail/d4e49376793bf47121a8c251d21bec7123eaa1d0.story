Tragic: Jack Wooding was killed after a climbing accident in Scotland. He suffered severe head injuries after falling more than 300ft

A heartbroken family have paid tribute to a 'fearless and sports loving' Oxford University graduate who was killed after a climbing accident in the Scottish mountains.

Jack Wooding, 29, suffered severe head injuries after falling more than 300ft and had to be airlifted from the side of the snow covered mountain by a rescue helicopter team before being taken to hospital.

Mr Wooding, a legal expert, was an experienced climber but according to his twin George, he was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident as it was 'just a gentle slope' and although he tried to stop himself with an ice axe as he slipped, he was unable to do so.

The accident happened at a location 
known as Aladdin's Mirror in the Cairngorms near Aviemore and he was 
taken first to Inverness and then onto Aberdeen hospital after his 
climbing partner alerted emergency services.

His
father Eric, mother Margaret, sister Mona and George, rushed to his 
bedside from their home in Ashtead near Dorking, Surrey, where doctors 
told them he had suffered 'unsurvivable brain injuries' and he died 24 
hours later without regaining consciousness.

Jack
had worked at the London chambers of Herbert Smith for several years 
but left there four months ago to start work as a legal adviser at the 
Department of Transport.

As 
the family cleared his flat in Tower Hamlets, East London, George paid 
tribute to his twin, who graduated with a double first in politics and 
modern history from Oxford, and said: 'He had many sides to him. He loved
extreme sports. He was so happy when he was ice climbing, mountain 
biking or ski-ing. We just about managed to talk him out of moto cross. 
That's the type of guy he was.

'He had another side to him as well - he was funny and also gentle and soft. He was very intellectual and would write indepth legal articles for his work. He had only recently changed jobs and had also worked at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the past as well.

'He had lots of friends and was adored by everyone both locally and in London. The accident was just one of those things. He slipped in the snow and the momentum carried him down. It was a gentle slope - nothing more than Box Hill near where we live - and he didn't need ropes or a helmet.

'We spoke to the mountain rescue people and they said it was approachable and it wasn't too dangerous. It was just the momentum - I suppose if he had ropes and a helmet he would have been OK. It was just rotten luck.

'It just happened at the wrong place and he went over the edge. He tried to stop himself but he couldn't. It's just so sad that he has lost his life because he had so much potential. The only comfort we have is that he died doing something he enjoyed.'

Mr Wooding said of the slope where his son was killed: 'They had done a risk assessment of it. They thought they didn't need ropes and helmets, they didn't see any great problems. But even with an axe he couldn't stop himself. jack didn't do things by halves. He had physical courage, he was a brave man. He liked the riskiness of climbing.'

Jack was also a member of the Alpine Club, which was founded in 1857, which has described itself as 'a club of English gentleman devoted to mountaineering, first of all in the Alps, members of which have successfully addressed themselves to attempts of the kind on loftier mountains.'

Members paid tribute to him on the club website where was described as 'aspirant' and fellow climber John Evans wrote: 'Sad news indeed he was a lovely bloke, a gentle sort but full of enthusiasm.'

A report on the accident, which happened last week, has been sent to the Procurator Fiscal in Scotland and his funeral will be held on 24th January in Ashtead.
