Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki has often insisted that her love of the game comes first and she is not interested in the money her famously lucrative sport can bring.

And it seems she could be telling the truth as it has been revealed that she forgot to pick up her $1.45 million check after she finished runner-up at the U.S. Open a few weeks ago.

After failing to win her first Grand Slam title once again to Serena Williams, the 24-year-old accepted her trophy and fulfilled her media duties, before rushing back to her $7million Manhattan apartment.

Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki  has revealed she forgot to pick up her $1.45 million check after she finished runner-up at the U.S. Open earlier this month

After failing to win her first Grand Slam title once again to Serena Williams, the 24-year-old accepted her trophy and fulfilled her media duties, before rushing off to her Manhattan apartment and then realising she did not have her winnings

But half an hour later 'she arrived back at the tennis center, a look of mild panic on her face.'

'I forgot to pick up my prize money,' she said reports Wall Street Journal.

Williams walked home with the biggest paycheck ever for a single tennis tournament of $4 million.

Wozniacki was later photographed at New York Fashion Week with Williams and Vogue editor Anna Wintour, so she may have had other things on her mind.

'I want to do well for myself and my sponsors...but I feel no pressure, because I don't play for the money,' she said in the interview.

'I have enough to eat, buy nice shoes,'

'For me, it's about the tennis and the trophies. I'm not motivated by money.' 

She also said that she does not know how much she pays her father who is her coach and closest confidant and that that she doesn't monitor her bank accounts. 

But the Danish tennis star, who has been sponsored by a whole host of brands including Adidas, Rolex, and Sony Ericsson, does add: 'I will do a chocolate deal for product only. No need for money.' 

Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated $24million - she is 11th on the all-time Women's Tennis Association career earnings list, at nearly $18.4 million.

Earlier this month she spoke about the support of female friends such as Miss Williams after her ex-fiancé golfer Rory McIlroy broke up with her over the telephone.

She said: 'I went to Miami after the French Open and Serena was there and we had a great time.

'I came back from that and I felt refreshed, I felt like a new self. I started practising towards Wimbledon and I was playing well ... I think you just have to take life as it goes and I believe you never get things put on you that you can't handle. I'm definitely on the other side now – I've moved on.'

But she also seemed to hit out at her former fiance, suggesting McIlroy had found it hard to balance his career with their relationship.

She added: 'I think it is very important to have a life off the court and to me it wasn't that hard to balance tennis and a relationship.'

Wozniacki says she was left 'shocked' after McIlroy broke up with her but says she now intends to date a taller man.

The pair split at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations.

At the time, the Northern Irish golfer said the end of the three-year relationship was 'mutual and amicable' - but now Ms Wozniacki has revealed McIlroy broke up with her out of the blue during a ten-minute call and did not even give her 'a face-to-face'. 

Speaking about the break-up for the first time, she told In Depth With Graham Bensinger on Yahoo! News: 'It was very hard because he made it very public from the start. He put out a press release so I didn't have a choice, you know, it just got put in my face.

'Oh I was shocked. I thought at least, you know, I would get a face to face or something. But there was nothing – it was just a phone call and I did not hear from him again. 

''I don't think you expect to find yourself in a situation like that, you can't prepare yourself or your body for anything like that so I think I was in a bit of a shocked phase there for a while.'

Multi-millionaire McIlroy, who won the coveted British Open in July, announced he and Ms Wozniacki had split earlier this year because he was not ready for 'all that marriage entails'.

He later said in a statement released through Dublin-based communications consultants that the 'problem is mine'.

At the time, he said it would be difficult to concentrate on the tournament on the back of a public break-up. But days later, McIlroy went on to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

His form continued and, in July, he won the British Open by a clear margin, before going on to win the U.S. PGA Championship.

He later claimed that the break-up was the reason behind his unstoppable form, saying: 'I think what happened has been for the best in terms of my golf.

'I've put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?'  

According to sources, their wedding was due to take place at the Rockefeller Centre in New York on November 8. 

In a statement after their break-up, McIlroy said: 'The problem is mine.

'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had.'

Ms Wozniacki, who was born in Denmark to Polish parents, became world number one in 2012.
