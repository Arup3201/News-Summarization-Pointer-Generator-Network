A 75-year-old woman was killed when her vintage tractor overturned as she drove home from exhibiting it at a country show.

Edith Hannis lost control of the slow-moving vehicle as she drove along a country lane in Sapperton, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

Police believe that Mrs Hannis, from Cranham, near Gloucester, was trapped after the 1966 Massey Ferguson tractor clipped a verge and rolled over.

Firefighters, paramedics and police tried to save her, but she died at the scene.

Mrs Hannis's husband David was driving further ahead and was unaware of the crash when he got home.

The incident happened at about 3pm on Saturday.

Sergeant Tony Wallace, of Gloucestershire Police, said: 'It would appear the driver was coming home in the old farmer’s type D-reg tractor.

'Her husband, in a car in front, had got home and hadn’t realised what had happened.

'The first call came from the ambulance saying the road was blocked and a female was trapped underneath the tractor.

'Despite attempts to resuscitate the woman, she sadly died as a result of her injuries.

'The road was completely blocked until 8.30pm as the vehicle had to be recovered using specialist equipment.

'Highways also cleared the diesel spillage.'

Scene: The crash happened on a country lane near the village of Sapperton in Gloucestershire
