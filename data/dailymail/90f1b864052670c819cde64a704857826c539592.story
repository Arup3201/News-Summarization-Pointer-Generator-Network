They are a menace on roads up and down the country.

But with a touch of imagination, a few props and a handful of images, one photographer shows how unsightly potholes can be transformed into works of art.

Davide Luciano has used the huge gaps in the concrete for a variety of scenes, including a deep fat fryer, a swimming pool and a spaghetti bowl.

A photographer, based in New York, has been inspired to create quirky images with potholes after he damaged his car when he ran over one. Pictured is a diver diving into a 'swimming pool' pothole off a makeshift board

Davide then used models to create quirky scenarios, such as a fisherman reeling in a catch and a lifeguard saving a person from drowning.

Some of the images even depict people using the potholes to wash clothes, chill champagne, go scuba diving, plant flowers and crush berries.

Davide filled the potholes with real props and only used computer software programme Photoshop to alter some of the colours.

His amusing pictures now sell for nearly Â£800 for a set of nine.

Davide, 34, from New York, said: 'The idea came to life after I had sudden collision with a canyon sized crater of a pothole.

'I decided to channel my frustration 
into a positive project where the useless pothole would be a source of 
humour and creativity.

'I attempted to visualise and incorporate potholes as everyday props and the project started as a humorous way to expose the ridiculous pothole problem.

'After creating a scene on paper, I scoured the city and located the appropriate pothole for each photograph. The images were shot in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and Montreal.

'I don't use Photoshop to create the image or add props, I only use it for colour correction.

'Seeing people's reactions to my work is wonderful, mostly smiles and laughter.

'They are astonished to hear that I do not photoshop the props into the scenes, but that everything is actually set in and around the pothole.'
