Miroslav Klose has equalled Ronaldo's goalscoring record at the World Cup.

The German forward came off the bench against Ghana to score his first goal of the tournament, which put him joint level on 15 in finals history with the Brazilian legend.

Klose came on with his side at 2-1 down, but grabbed one from close range within two minutes to level the scores.

Leveller: Miroslav Klose is now the joint top scorer in World Cup history with 15

Finisher: The German forward scored his 15th goal in finals in the 2-2 draw with Ghana

Congratulation: Felicitations from Ronaldo

2002: 3 vs Saudi Arabia, 1 vs Republic of Ireland, 1 vs Cameroon

Tournament total: 5

2006: 2 vs Costa Rica, 2 vs Ecuador, 1 vs Argentina

Tournament total: 5

2010: 1 vs Australia, 1 vs England, 2 vs Argentina

Tournament total: 4

2014: 1 vs Ghana

Tournament total: 1 (so far)

WORLD CUP TOTAL: 15

And he was congratulated by Ronaldo himself, who took to twitter to personally show his appreciation of his new equal.

Klose's first World Cup appearance came in 2002, where he scored a hat trick in an 8-0 victory over Saudi Arabia.

He netted again in their next group game, a 1-1 draw with Republic of Ireland, before scoring the second in a 2-0 victory over Cameroon.

Despite Germany's run to the final that year, Klose failed to find the net again in the tournament, eventually finishing level on goals with Rivaldo, and behind top scorer Ronaldo who grabbed eight.

During his home World Cup four years later in 2006, the forward found the net five times again, which was enough for the Golden Boot.

Nodder: Klose peels away after scoring against Cameroon during the 2002 World Cup

Nutter: The forward leaping to head the equaliser against Argentina in the 2006 quarter-final

Slipped in: Klose scoring the opener of a 4-1 victory against England in the last-16 in 2010

He scored two goals in their opening 4-2 victory over Costa Rica, and twice more in their final group game against Ecuador.

Klose's final goal in that World Cup was his vital 80th-minute equaliser against Argentina in the quarter-finals, that brought the score to 1-1, with Germany eventually winning on penalties.

And in 2010, he managed four more strikes: one in their opening 4-0 win over Australia, once in their 4-1 demolition of England in the last-16 and twice in their 4-0 destruction of Argentina in the quarter-finals.

Chances are that, at 36, this World Cup will be his last, so he has a possibly maximum of five games to grab that vital goal that will bring him the all-time record.
