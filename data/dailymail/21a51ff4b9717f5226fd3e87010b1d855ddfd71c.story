Cristiano Ronaldo made it 20 league goals by November in Real Madrid’s 4-0 win over Eibar – no wonder Carlo Ancelotti could be seen imitating his top scorer’s goal celebration on the touchline.

As Ronaldo made 20 goals in 12 games Real Madrid made it 14 straight victories taking Ancelotti to within one of Jose Mourinho’s record 15-win run at the club. He could draw level on Wednesday against Basel in the Champions League with a victory that would also give Liverpool a helping hand in Group B.

Ronaldo, who scored in both halves is well on course to smash Lionel Messi's record of 50 goals in the 2011-12 season.

When he got the second goal of the game and performed his chest-out arms-outstretched ‘here I am’ celebration, Ancelotti could be seen copying it in the technical area, much to the amusement of his coaching staff.

This was always going to be tough for Eibar whose 16m budget for their entire squad wouldn’t pay Ronaldo’s salary. They started brightly but were gradually undone by Real Madrid’s 300m forward line.

Madrid could have taken the lead on seven minutes when Gareth Bale dipped a vicious free-kick from 30-yards out and Eibar keeper Xabi Irueta did well to adjust his position to tip the ball over.

When the first goal came it was controversial with two possible claims for offside. Ronaldo crossed to Karim Benzema who looked offside as he tried to poke it past Irueta. His shot ran back out to Ronaldo who, now also looked offside as this time, he picked out James Rodriguez at the back post, and the Colombian headed home.

Eibar had a chance to equalize when Ander Capa found Saul Berjon and only a fine save from Iker Casillas kept Madrid ahead.

Ronaldo then got his name on the scoresheet when Bale and Carvajal cominbed down the right and from Carvajal’s cross Ronaldo found the bottom corner. He has now scored in his last 11 league games. Leo Messi once scored in 21 straight matches but on this form you wouldn’t back against Ronaldo beating that record too. 

In the second half Benzema made it 3-0 converting Rodriguez’s cross into the roof of Irueta’s net. Eibar players complained that the ball had gone out of play when the Colombian hooked it back across the face of the goal for Benzema to finish. Ronaldo then got the fourth from the spot to complete the rout.

It was an impressive performance from Madrid in their first game without Luka Modric who will be out for three months with a tendon injury in his left thigh. Despite his absence Arsenal target Sami Khedira was still left on the bench just a month from being able to negotiate a free transfer away from the club.

The result kept Real Madrid on top of the table. They had overcome a potentially tricky international break game, winning their first league encounter ever in Ipurua. And they had made it look frightening easy.
