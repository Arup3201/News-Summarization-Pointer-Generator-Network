A mother who lost her legs protecting her children as a tornado ravaged their home last year has shown her amazing resilience as she is honored by NASCAR.

Stephanie Decker, a mother-of-three who now uses state-of-the-art prosethetics, appeared at the raceway in Darlington, South Carolina for a special event - which was aptly held on Mother's Day.

NASCAR invited her to the Southern 500 for its 'Ten Days of Giving' initiative and, while there with her husband and two young children, she was given a tour of the pit area and introduced to drivers.

Mrs Decker, 38, gained national attention when she saved her two young children from a tornado that destroyed their home in Henryville, Kentucky last year.

She covered 10-year-old son Dominic and seven-year-old daughter Reese as a falling beam severed her legs and a second punctured her lung and broke eight ribs.

Dominic, who along with his sister only suffered scrapes and bruises, ran for help. It took rescuers 45 minutes to reach her, and when she arrived at hospital she had lost about 50 per cent of her blood. 

She lost one leg above 
the knee and the other foot and since the accident, she has gained the reputation as a determined advocate for others who have lost limbs.

Decker has established the Stephanie 
Decker Foundation to assist children in need of prosthetics and helping 
others gain access to leading edge prosthetics.

She recently helped push a state law through in Kentucky requiring insurance companies to give patients access to better technology for prosthetic limbs and now has the federal level in her sights.

Her family maintains that losing limbs 'could happen to anyone' and that it is Stephanie's fighting spirit since the accident which has shown her real strength of character.

Her husband Joe told NASCAR: 'She
and I have both taken the same approach... just the fact she's here and
the kids are here and they're okay, I think we can live with whatever 
hand we've been dealt.

'I
told her, "What you did was great, but I think a ton of moms would have
done the exact same thing. But to me, what set you apart is how you've 
handled it since."

Happy family: Stephanie was surrounded by her family at the hospital, including her husband Joe (left), son Dominic (center right) and Reese (right)

A mother's love: As soon as the storm passed, Dominic, 8, ran to a neighbor's home for help

'If you want to sit and dwell on it and go, "woe is me" then you're not going to make it very far. She has not done that once.'

Mrs Decker added: 'There were about 10 minutes of grieving. Then we knew we had to come up with a plan to get my life back to where it was.

'It's a teaching moment for my kids too.
They've learned that life throws you struggles and bring times that you
think are unbearable, but there's always a solution... We adapt and 
cope.'

Stephanie competed in triathlons with her husband before the accident 
and is working to return to similar pastimes with her prosthetics.

'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana

Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said

Destruction:
The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds destroyed by 
tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was 
entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather

'I expect to do the things that I did
before, and that's what we need to demand from our insurance 
companies,' she said. 'That's what we're going to be fighting for 
nationwide.'

She and her family were invited to 
Yankee Stadium, where Dominic played catch with New York stars Derek 
Jeter and Robinson Cano. The family also visited the Oval Office, with Mrs Decker speaking to the president about making sure prosthetics
would be covered by insurance.

'She definitely had an agenda,' joked husband Joe, a baseball coach at Silver Creek High School.

She recently revealed that the family has almost finished building their new home in Sellersburg.

She also showed off her new legs, which have flexible prosthetic ankles and different settings for driving and walking. She charges the 
batteries in her two ankles and one knee every night.

Brave: She has shown astonishing determination throughout the year, including as she walked through the White House last June, aided by President Obama, her husband and children

Upbeat: She also danced with Ellen DeGeneres on her show just two months after the accident

'I get up in the morning and instead of 
putting on a pair of shoes, I put on a pair of legs,' Decker told the Courier Journal. 'And 
then my day begins. It’s fixing lunches, getting kids off to school.'

She also spends as much as two hours every day training at the gym.

Decker was injured when a series of mega tornadoes raged across 
Southern Indiana and Kentucky last March, killing 39, injuring 
many and destroying thousands of homes and schools.

The Decker’s inspirational story is 
one of the few from that fateful day, which saw deaths in Alabama, 
Georgia. Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, with Indiana and Kentucky 
particularly hard hit, with 13 and 21 lives lost respectively.
