Amateur film-makers will soon be able to give footage an age rating when posting it on YouTube.

A project - which will have three traffic light classifications of green, amber and red - is aiming to cut down on the amount of harmful and inappropriate content that can be seen by children online.

When amateur film-makers post clips online, they will be able to give them ratings corresponding to British Board of Film Classification levels - grouped into the three sets of U/PG, 12/15 and 18/R18.

Protecting children: Videos such as this one filmed during the London riots of 2011 may be subject to an 'amber' rating because they could be distressing for younger viewers

Dangerous: Videos of extreme sportsmen or stunt artists suffering harm could be given red ratings, comparable to the 18 certificate received by the Jackass U.S. series

Video websites - not restricted to YouTube - would also be able to allow viewers to comment on how films were rated, which could alert users and national authorities to any serious mistakes.

The idea of a do-it-yourself rating system for uploaded videos was formed though discussions between the BBFC and classification bodies in Italy and the Netherlands, reported The Observer.

‘This is a service we want to offer,’ BBFC policy spokesman David Austin told the newspaper. ‘We already classify some 10,000 videos and films that are submitted to us for release every year.

‘We will be using much the same classification model in the pilot for user-generated content.’

The extraordinary number of videos uploaded to YouTube and other video sharing websites every day has made it impossible for any regulatory board to watch all the footage themselves.

No problems: Innocent videos on YouTube, such as the famous 'Charlie bit my finger - again' from 2007, would most likely be given a green (Universal or Parental Guidance) rating by the person uploading them

But the idea for an online questionnaire about the content uploaded by an amateur producer was formed after conversations with the Dutch film regulator, reported The Observer.

The BBFC said that the questionnaire results will mean ‘different things in different countries’ - such as users in the Netherlands not worrying so much about bad language, compared to the British. It is expected that the system will be tested from this summer.

Access that children can get to inappropriate online content is a concern for many parents.

The Mail is campaigning for internet providers to automatically block access to porn, with an optional opt-in, rather than parents having to rely on software to limit access.

Last week research revealed one in four children who try to get around parental controls on internet use are looking for pornography.
