A grandmother who lost her false teeth finally discovered them hidden behind her fridge- after a rodent stole them from her kitchen.

Margaret Lowe, 77, put the teeth in a glass of water before going to bed.

But the next morning Mrs Lowe was stunned when she could not find the plastic dentures.

When her son came to visit, he heard a strange scratching noise from behind the fridge.

Margaret Lowe, could not find her dentures after she had put them into a glass of water in the kitchen. Her son eventually found them behind the fridge - where they had been hidden by a rat

The dirty dentures were buried alongside a knife, tea bags and dog biscuits - and dozens of rat droppings behind Mrs Lowe's fridge

When Stephen Lowe, 53 pulled out the fridge, at his mother's house in Grove Park, south east London, he found her dentures hidden.

The dirty dentures were buried alongside a knife, tea bags and dog biscuits - and dozens of rat droppings.

Mrs Lowe was astounded when she discovered that a rodent was behind the theft.

But pet dog Denis, quickly came to the rescue when it killed the rat as it ran across the kitchen floor.

Mrs Lowe has already ordered a new set of teeth after the ordeal and the original dentures also required a good clean.

But, in an exclusive interview with The Sun she said: 'I'll stick to my new ones after where they've been.'

The rodent was killed by the grandmother's Jack Russell, at her home in south east London. Mrs Lowe is pictured here with her dog Denis

Mrs Lowe's discovery of the thieving rodent comes just days after rats the size of cats have started being pictured across the U.K.

Giant rats have been spotted in Birmingham, County Durham, Bradford and Liverpool.

Mutant rats, which required stronger than average poison, have been pictured in Oxford, Berkshire, Henley-on-Thames and Hampshire.

One man in Cornwall was pictured with a rat which reportedly measured 6ft1 - taller than the average British male height which is 5ft10.
