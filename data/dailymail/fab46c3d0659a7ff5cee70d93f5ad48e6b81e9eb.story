A former teacher at the exclusive Miss Porter's School, who is serving an 18-month sentence for sexually assaulting a female student, now faces more jail time for child porn.

Married father-of-three Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 44, who taught physics at the Connecticut girls' school, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one count of child pornography.

The charge directly relates to his abuse of a 17-year-old girl at the school after he allegedly coerced her into creating a secret email account in  2011 and then pushed her to expose her breasts to him during video chats.

Disgraced: Teacher Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 44, who is currently in state prison serving 18 months for the sexual assault of a student at the exclusive Miss Porter's, is facing more jail time over a child porn charge 

A federal investigation discovered that Rajkumar sent and received messages with at least six female students at his school.

He even tried to force another girl to have a sexual relationship with him, the Hartford Courant reported. 

He texted one girl that she 'looked hot' in the pants she was wearing and told another to create an email account, without using her name, to do 'naughty things'.   

The disgraced teacher is due back in court for sentencing on February 6 where he faces up to 20 years in prison. 

Rajkumar was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ten years on probation in January 2014 for the attack at the Farmington school.

He must register as a sex offender for a decade after prison. Judge Joan Alexander told Rajkumar in January that as part of his probation, he could not teach or be near children under 16.

The sentence will keep the sex offender away from his three children aged one, three and eight years old.

His wife, Sarah Rajkumar, begged the judge not to register her husband as a sex offender but Judge Alexander said it was required by law.

Mrs Rajkumar told the court in January that her husband was an 'exceptionally good man who made a grave error in judgment', adding that he had been overwhelmed by his responsibilities at the school and at home. 

Privileged: The elite Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut is a private boarding and day school for girls where tuition costs up to $52,000 each year

The victim was not in court for sentencing although her father was present. The judge praised the student for coming forward to report Rajkumar's attacks.

Rajkumar who taught physics and coached soccer and track, was employed at the school in August 2009. 

He was fired on March 4, 2013 and charged on March 25 with two counts of felony second-degree sexual assault and one count of misdemeanor fourth-degree sexual assault. 

Police said the allegations dated back to 2010. The victim said that Rajkumar started groping her when she was 15 and that they had sex in his classroom closet and sent sexual videos to one another after she turned 17.

The allegations came out after the former student, who is now in college, told her boyfriend who went to the police.

The former student said that it had started when she was 15 and that Rajkumar would hug her and run his hands down her back when she was stressed about big tests.

The girl told police that the situation developed and that she and Rajkumar had sex several times during some weeks. They had sex in a closet in his classroom.

Miss Porter's is a girls-only, college preparatory school established in 1843. It is a small, private establishment with 306 girls currently enrolled. There are 52 teachers of which half live on the campus.

The school takes pride in a vast array of extracurricular activities including 18 sports teams, dance and theater programs, pottery, painting and textile classes.

Tuition for this year costs $52,475 for boarding students and $42,055 for girls who attend day classes.

Miss Porter's was founded by education reformer Sarah Porter, who, in contrast to finishing schools of the day, insisted on a rigorous education for young women including chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the regular subjects of Latin, foreign languages, history and geography.

The school is known for its close-knit community. According to the official website: 'Miss Porter's School educates young women to become informed, bold, resourceful and ethical global citizens.

'We expect our graduates to shape a changing world.'

Former students include Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who attended Miss Porter's from 1944 to 1947.

Another notable alumna is Gloria Vanderbilt, a member of the legendary American dynasty and mother of CNN's Anderson Cooper. Other former students, who call themselves 'Ancients' include socialite and fashion designer Lilly Pulitzer.
