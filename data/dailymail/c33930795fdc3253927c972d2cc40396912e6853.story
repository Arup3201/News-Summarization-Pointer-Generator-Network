Sam Allardyce's uneasy relationship with the locals at West Ham United is down to the perception his teams play dull football. It is hard to see how the dour baggage carried by his proposed replacement David Moyes will have them putting out bunting in the East End.

Moyes is a good manager — but with the move to the Olympic Stadium just one full season away, are the board thinking big enough?

Beyond the elite, managing West Ham should be one of the most appealing projects in the European game right now. Here is an opportunity to take a club with a significant fan-base and history to an iconic, 58,000-capacity destination stadium and reach for the sky.

West Ham’s owners are talking of Europe, yet Moyes is a coach whose appointment seems to be made with one eye on making sure the club isn’t relegated next season and goes to its new home established in the Premier League.

Jurgen Klopp, coach of Borussia Dortmund, appears to be nearing journey’s end in the Bundesliga. He is a charismatic, successful figure, given to taking on long-term projects and working with a reasonable budget.

He plays good football, too, and has talked of managing in England. It was presumed he would one day manage Arsenal, but Arsene Wenger is not going anywhere soon.

It might be over-ambitious, it might go no further than one exploratory telephone call and a splutter of mocking laughter; but isn’t it worth making that call, just in case?
