A Chinese man whose jealous wife cut off his manhood twice when she discovered he had been cheating on her has been offered to star in a porn film.

Fan Lung, 32, suffered his scorned wife's wrath after he used her mobile to send a sauce email to his lover in Shangqiu in central China's Henan province.

A pornography production company has now reached out to Mr Fan, offering to pay for an x-rated film starring him and his mistress  Zhang Hung, 21.

Aptly named porn firm Bang You Later offered their 'deepest and sincere condolences' before offering to 'cover costs of production and distribution and you would keep 100 per cent of the proceeds,' The Mirror reports.  

'Our intention is to help you financially through this incredibly delicate time but to also help you to restore your sexual confidence,' the company wrote in a letter to Mr Fan.

Mr Fan lost his penis when wife Feng Lung, 30, discovered her his affair with Miss Zhang, and she cut off his manhood with a pair of scissors, then snipped it off again after surgeons reattached it.

She is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm. 

But after forgetting to log out of his account on his wife's phone  she came across the message and several others, and flew into a rage.

Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and cut off his penis.  

Surgeons were able to reattach it, but fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

This prompted the cheat to turn on his wife and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital. 

A hospital spokesman said: 'The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital.

'Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

'He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.'

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member. They believe it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman said: 'The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery.

'He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught.'

Fan's lover, who visited him at the hospital, said she planned to marry him as soon as she could.

'It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,' Zhang said.

Feng was discharged and is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm.
