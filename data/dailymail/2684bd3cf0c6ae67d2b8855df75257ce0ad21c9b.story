A Hollywood smile could be just half an hour away thanks to a new peroxide-free treatment, one dentist claims.

Dr Giacomo Favero claims to have taken hundreds of calls from people wanting to try out Megawhite since he first introduced the treatment to his London practice.

The procedure, which take less than half an hour and is painless, is changing the face of teeth whitening, said Dr Favero.

All white: Dr Giacomo Favero believes his £89, peroxide-free whitening treatment, performed here at his dental surgery on London's Wimpole Street, is the future of teeth whitening

He says that it is the only peroxide-free treatment available in England, using only natural ingredients to deliver immediate results.

Dr Favero, 34, said of the £89 treatment: 'I only believe in this product.

'With this treatment there is no pain, no sensitivity.

'I am the only one in England who offers this treatment.'

Using a mixture of sodium bicarbonate, peppermint oil and other activators, Dr Favero promises patients they will leave with a natural white smile.

He said: 'Every patient wants something fast, no pain, a good price and results guaranteed. And this product delivers on all those points.

'It's made of natural ingredients. Ones you find in toothpaste, so it's great for teeth.

'A lot of patients have sensitive teeth.

Faith: Dr Favero is the only dentist in the country to offer the 'pain-free' treatment, which uses a combination of ingredients commonly found in toothpaste

'They have consumed a lot of acid in the diet which has weakened the enamel on the teeth. This is the ideal treatment for them.'

Dr Favero opened his first London practice on Wimpole Street in April last year and has been offering Megawhite for six months.

It has become so popular that Dr Favero is fully booked until the end of May.

He said: 'Usually a teeth whitening session would set you back at least £300 a time.

'This is an express treatment. We can do it before a birthday or a red carpet event. It's like going to a salon for a beauty treatment.

'I first ask how white they want to go. I take a photo and check the starting shade.

'Then I hand the patient a tray with ready-made gel in it and ask them to place it in their mouth before shining a blue light on the mouth area to activate the gel.

'After 20-25 minutes I ask them to take it out, rinse and that is all.

'I ask my patients 'Did you feel any pain?' And they say 'No, doctor. This is amazing!'

'When I give them the mirror, that is the best bit. They see the results straight away.

'It gives a very natural look as people want natural, healthy-looking teeth.'

Innovative: Dr Favero hails from a dental dynasty - his family run dental clinics all over Italy and his father, Gian Antonio, was one of the world's first implantologists

A chance encounter on his honeymoon in Buenos Aires last year led him down this path.

Dr Favero, who lives with wife Federica in Holland Park, said: 'I was in the hotel by the pool and I got talking to a man from Scotland.

'He asked me what I do and I told him I was a dentist. He said he did teeth whitening and he told me about this product that only lasted 20 minutes and contained no peroxide.

'We met again and I tried the product. I was really impressed.'The Favero name is already well known in Italy, where Giacomo hails from.

His family run dental clinics all over Italy and his father Gian Antonio was one of the first implantologists in the world.

'I wanted to prove I could do it alone so I moved to London.

'This is my first project. I had patients who travelled back to Italy from the UK to get treatment.

'So I thought, instead of them coming back, why don't I go to them.

'I would love to treat everybody.'

He added: 'Dentists are stupid, they do not have vision. They want to make money, they think this is too cheap.

'I do think this is going to catch on.

'Dentistry is changing. I'm trying to get rid of the stigma that dentists are scary.'

Current teeth whitening can cost up to £800 and all contain peroxide. The treatment can take days to apply, although it lasts years.
