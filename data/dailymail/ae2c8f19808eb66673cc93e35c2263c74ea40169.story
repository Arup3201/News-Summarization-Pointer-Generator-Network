The police force which led the investigation into murdered schoolgirl April Jones could become the first in the UK to abandon monitoring CCTV 'because it fails to cut crime', it has emerged.

Dyfed Powys Police is set to receive reduced funding for CCTV after an independent investigation found they have had 'little success in deterring violent crime or anti-social behaviour'.

But, it could also stop monitoring live camera footage altogether - as early as January next year - if an inquiry by the force decides it is the best course of action. 

It would leave the police force, which covers an area more than half the size of Wales, without any monitored CCTV cameras.

The force's biggest investigation was the hunt for five-year-old April, who vanished while playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, in October 2012.

CCTV images caught killer Mark Bridger's car on the night of her disappearance, ultimately leading to his arrest.

Using footage from a variety of private and public cameras, police were able to piece together a complete picture of his movements which formed a central part of the prosecution case.

But a report ordered by Christopher Salmon, Police and Crime Commissioner for the force, concluded that live monitoring of CCTV footage should stop.

He said the removal of cameras would not result in 'significant rises' in crime.

Dyfed-Powys Police records show that for the 12 months leading up until August this year, only 1.5 per cent of case files used publicly-controlled CCTV evidence. In addition, 2.2 per cent used evidence from private CCTV systems.

The CCTV network in the UK is one of the largest in the world - with the Shetland Islands Council and Corby Borough Council - among the smallest local authorities in the UK - having more cameras than the San Francisco Police Department.

The inquiry into CCTV systems revealed cameras which flood town centres and housing estates do not have a significant impact on crime.

Instrom Security Consultants, which carried out the report, discovered that while cameras have a modest impact on crime levels, they are at their most effective in reducing car crime in car parks, especially when used alongside improved lighting and the introduction of security guards.

The CCTV review came at a time when many local councils are reducing funding to police due to financial pressures.

Mr Salmon said: 'We must spend every pound where it delivers. In the meantime, I'm giving the public what they ask me for - more bobbies on the beat.'

The crime commissioner said he will discuss the inquiry findings with chief constable Simon Prince and county council leaders before agreeing to stop the CCTV monitoring in the New Year.

He said: 'I look forward to our discussions to agree a solution for CCTV that delivers value and that most of all is effective.

'This research will be an important reference point as we develop a strategy.'

The Dyfed-Powys force covers more than half of Wales, from Pembrokeshire to the English border with Shropshire. But, it is sparsely populated with only 488,000 people in the force area.

A Home Office report into CCTV effectiveness, whose authors include Cambridge University criminologist David Farrington, said cameras should continue to be used but have a much narrower focus, such as reducing vehicle crime.

Traditionally, CCTV cameras have been funded by councils with police meeting the costs of monitoring them.

The report found monitored CCTV cameras do not deter crime or anti-social behaviour and many are unable to produce evidence acceptable in court.

However, the inquiry confirmed they can play a crucial role in securing convictions.

The report said: 'Properly presented, relevant CCTV evidence provides a very credible witness factor when cases were judged they allowed the context of an incident to be conveyed to the court - particularly relevant in cases of violent behaviour.

'Also, they are instrumental in challenging not guilty pleas, and often led to an early admission of guilt.'
