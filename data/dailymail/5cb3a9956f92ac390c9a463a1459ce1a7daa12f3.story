Thriving: Eliza Bellamy is now a healthy six-month-old despite doctors claiming she had died after eight months in the womb

At six months old, little Eliza Bellamy is the bonniest of babies.

But her smile belies the trauma of her entry into the world and an ordeal that no parent should ever have to face.

When her mother Ellen was eight months pregnant, two doctors announced that her baby had died in the womb and would be stillborn.

The news left her ‘simply devastated’.

And while carrying what she thought was a dead baby, she and her husband Chris then had to think about funeral arrangements.

Not only that, but at one point Mr Bellamy feared his wife had died as well after he saw a crash team rush into the hospital theatre where she was giving birth.

In fact, the team were on standby because – against the doctors’ expectations – Eliza had been born alive.

Despite this joyous reversal of fortune, doctors then further upset Mrs Bellamy, 31, by blaming her ‘excess stomach weight’ for their misdiagnosis.

Wexham Park Hospital in Berkshire has since apologised to the couple. The blunder occurred on a Sunday and at a time when the sonographer, an expert in doing ultrasounds, was not working.

The couple, who are both teachers and have a four-year-old daughter, Ava, said their nightmare began in November when Mrs Bellamy was admitted to hospital with heavy bleeding at 35 weeks.

Two doctors carried out scans to check the baby.

‘When doctors told us our baby wasn’t moving and there was no heartbeat, Chris and I were simply devastated,’ said Mrs Bellamy.

‘And when nursing staff asked us to call relatives to bring a shawl to wrap up our dead baby in, and began discussing funeral plans, it was traumatic.

‘Calling my mother, my brother and sister-in-law with that news was the worst thing we have ever had to do. They then had the job of telling other family and friends, including our daughter.’

Ellen Bellamy, 31, had been planning the funeral when she unexpectedly went into labour. But she was distraught when the medics said it was her 'excess stomach fat' that caused them to make the blunder

The couple, from Langley, Berkshire, were then forced to wait four hours preparing for the arrival of their stillborn baby until an operating theatre became free.

Mrs Bellamy said: ‘I still wanted to be awake when she was born, and hold her in my arms, even if she wasn’t alive. So I opted for an epidural.

'However, four attempts failed. And as I was bleeding so much I had to sign a consent form for a general anaesthetic, which meant Chris had to leave and wait outside.’

Mr Bellamy recalled the moment he believed he had lost his wife.

‘Suddenly the alarm went off and I saw a crash team rushing into the theatre,’ he said. ‘In that moment my whole world imploded as I thought Ellen had also died.’

However, unknown to him,  Eliza had been born alive weighing 5lb 2oz and the crash team had been called in case she needed to be resuscitated.

Mr Bellamy added: ‘About five minutes after the alarm sounded a midwife said our little girl had been born alive and well.

‘I will never forget the feeling of sheer relief when I realised both Ellen and Eliza were fine. I couldn’t believe it when the midwife showed me to a little cot where Eliza lay kicking her legs.’

Mrs Bellamy said that when she came round from the anaesthetic and was told her baby had been born alive she could not take it in.

‘I only believed it was true when I was wheeled down to special care and saw her for myself,’ she said.

Eliza spent six days in the special care unit while Mrs Bellamy had several blood transfusions.

She added: ‘Worst, while the consultant was apologetic, when we discussed what had gone wrong, he said part of the reason he was unable to see the scan clearly was due to me having excess weight on my stomach.

Special care: Eliza, here at one day old, was born alive and well weighing 5lb 2oz, shocking doctors

‘I was shocked as I know of women much larger than me who’ve had normal pregnancies and been scanned efficiently.

‘And we believe we never would have suffered such a nightmare if a proper qualified sonographer had been on duty doing the scan.’

Eliza has no side effects, but her parents claim her survival was ‘through luck rather than judgment’ and are considering legal action.

A spokesman for Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We apologise unreservedly for the aspects of Mrs Bellamy’s care that fell below our usual standards. A serious incident was raised at the time and valuable lessons have been learned.

‘We understand this has been a traumatic and distressing time for Mrs Bellamy and her family and we will continue to work closely with her.’
