A webcam captured the incredible moment a rare African penguin chick hatched out of its shell, with the birth of its sibling set to follow.

The baby bird, born at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday, is apparently around the same size as a golf ball.

It is currently being nuzzled by its two busy parents, Sidney and Bette, who are taking it in turns to tend the nest.

Caught on camera: A webcam allowed viewers to watch the live birth of a rare African penguin on Monday - here one of the chick's parents can be seen

The fluffy chick cracked out of an egg laid on November 9 and a second egg, laid two days later, is expected to hatch this week.

The father, Sidney, is named for Sidney Crosby, the star of Pittsburgh's National Hockey League team, the Penguins.

It is the third set of chicks he has welcomed with his mate Bette.

Their newborns will be named after DNA tests can determine their gender in a few weeks' time.

After this point, they will be moved from the nest to an indoor enclosure to be hand-reared by National Aviary staff. 

Hidden from view: The baby bird is apparently around the size of a golf ball - it will be joined by a sibling this week if all goes well 

This special upbringing will ensure they are ready to fulfill their future roles as ambassadors for their species in the park's educational and interactive programs.

Monday's birth at the National Aviary brings to 17 the number of endangered African penguins in the aviary's Penguins Point exhibit.

Scientists estimate fewer than 20,000 of the birds exist in the wild, making them critically endangered.
