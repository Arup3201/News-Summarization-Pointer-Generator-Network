A woman accused of using a pound of bacon to start a fire in her ex-boyfriend's house will stand trial on arson charges. 

Cameo Crispi, a 32 year-old mother from Uintah County, Utah, was arrested on March 14 after her ex contacted police to say that she had been harassing him and he wanted her to stop -- and leave his home.

She had repeatedly called and texted her former flame, who was not home at the time, while at his residence, where she left the bacon over a lit burner.

When officers arrived on the scene, they saw smoke flowing out the front door, and noted that Crispi was drunk, the Deseret News reported.

Inside, they found hot coals on the floor around an open wood stove and the burned bacon.

Crispi's blood-alcohol level was 0.346, four times the legal limit, according to charging documents. 

'I asked to come in and observed a wood stove left open with a fire burning inside and hot coals on the floor around the stove,' the responding officer wrote in his report..

'I observed the burner to be on the setting "High" and the bacon to be severely burned and smoking badly.'

After containing the fire, the officer arrested Crispi.

Crispi appears at her preliminary hearing in Vernal, Utah earlier today

According to the initial charges, when asked by a doctor following the incident what had happened, Crispi stated she was 'attempting to start a fire in the house to get back at (her ex-boyfriend).' 

She is due back in court in October to face arson, burglary and other charges.

Her attorney, Clint E. Hendricks, declined to comment.
