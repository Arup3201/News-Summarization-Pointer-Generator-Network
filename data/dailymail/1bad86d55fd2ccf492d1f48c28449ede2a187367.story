Too lazy to get up to switch the kettle on? Soon you may be able to simply raise your hand or nod your head from another room, and you’ll be moments away from a fresh cup of tea.

This is the hope of researchers at the University of Washington who have developed technology that will allow people to control household devices with simple gestures.

The technology, named ‘WiSee’, is similar in concept to how Microsoft's Xbox Kinect sensor works by using cameras to recognise gestures.

By adapting a Wi-Fi router and wireless 
household devices, the researchers developed a system that can detect specific
movements without the need for sensors or cameras.

They claim it is simpler and cheaper than similar gesture-recognition technologies.

WiSee works using the Doppler effect - the way a wave of sound or light changes frequency at the point it is observed depending on the source of the wave’s movements.

A common example of the Doppler effect is the change in pitch of an ambulance siren as it passes.

A standard Wi-Fi router can be adapted to function as a receiver.

This
receiver then listens to all of the wireless transmissions coming from 
devices throughout a home, including smartphones, laptops and tablets.

When a person moves, there is a slight change in the frequency of the wireless signal.

Moving a hand or foot causes the receiver to detect a pattern of changes known as the Doppler frequency shift.

These
frequency changes are very small – only several hertz – when compared 
with Wi-Fi signals that have a 20 megahertz bandwidth and operate at 5 
gigahertz.

An algorithm to 
detect these slight shifts and the system also accounts for gaps in 
wireless signals when devices aren’t transmitting.

If a person wants to use the WiSee, they would perform a specific repetition gesture sequence to get access to the receiver.

Once
the wireless receiver locks onto the user, they can perform normal 
gestures to interact with the devices and appliances in her home.

The researchers tested these gestures with five users in a two-bedroom apartment and an office environment.

Out of the 900 gestures performed, WiSee accurately recognised 94 per cent of them.

It was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver.

Collaborator Sidhant Gupta, a 
doctoral student in computer science and engineering at the university, who has worked 
with Microsoft Research on two other similar technologies.

SoundWave, which, as its name suggests, uses sound waves to monitor 
whole-body gestures and Humantenna, which uses radiation from electrical
wires.

But WiSee stands apart because it doesn’t require the user to be in the same room as the receiver or the device.

WiSee detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of Wi-Fi signals as they reflect off a moving human body. When specific gestures are used, it was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver.

‘This is the first whole-home gesture recognition system that works without either requiring instrumentation of the user with sensors or deploying cameras in every room,’ said Qifan Pu, who worked on the research project.

The researchers now plan to look at the ability to control multiple devices at once.

WiSee detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of Wi-Fi signals as they reflect off a moving human body.

Using
a software algorithm, the technology can identify nine different 
whole-body gestures, ranging from pushing, pulling and punching to 
full-body bowling.
