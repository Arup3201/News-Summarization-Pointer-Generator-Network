Casanova of the cobbles: Coronation Street star Bill Roache

Coronation Street star Bill Roache has claimed to have slept with 1,000 women.

The 79-year-old actor, who plays Ken Barlow in the soap, admitted: ‘I didn’t have any control over my sex drive.’

On screen Mr Roache, who is the only original cast member, has had four wives and 28 flings since the programme began in 1960.

But off screen, as well as two wives, he has had countless flings and affairs and admitted that he regularly cheated on his first wife.

Some of his lovers have referred to him in bed by his character’s name, Ken, and he was nicknamed C*** Roache by some of his castmates because of his insatiable appetite.

He said that the women he has slept with include co-star Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner, with whom he had a one-night stand.

The pair got together after he went around to her flat for some drinks, but they fell out after a row during filming.

Pat, who died in 1986, didn't talk to him for years afterwards.

'It was just a one-off,' Mr Roache revealed.

'It was just something that happened one night when we were together. We weren't right for each other. She invited me round to her flat and we had a few drinks, then one thing led to another.

'At that time, she had a reputation, and she felt we should meet, as it were. It just happened.'

But Mr Roache, who was speaking on Piers Morgan's Life Stories, said his womanizing left him feeling empty and depressed.

'I regret it deeply,' he said.

'I had the opportunity, but that 
doesn’t mean I should do it. I had rehearsals up in Manchester from 
Monday to Friday. The opportunity was there.

'There were plenty of girls around. I
shouldn’t have done it. I didn’t have any control over my own sex 
drive. I didn’t have the strength to control it.

Romance: Roache also admitted having a brief romantic relationship with Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner in the ITV soap

'It depressed me. I’m so sorry for 
the things that I did. The hurt was the children. I’ll always regret 
that. Every morning I woke up regretting and hurting.”

He added: ‘Looking back, I didn’t know
any better. But what I did find out is it does not bring you happiness 
and it is not the way to be.

‘I
had the opportunity, I indulged it and I can tell you this: it’s not 
worth it - the pain that it caused, and there’s all sorts of dangers.

‘To love somebody and to make love to somebody that you love is the most beautiful thing in the world.’

Putting on a front: Bill in 1968 with two of his children, Vanya and Linus, and his first wife, actress Anna Cropper, who admitted to cheating on several times

Love of his life: Bill with his second wife Sara, who died in 2009 in her sleep, who he says he did not cheat on after learning the error of his ways

Mr
Roache said that he turned to drink after his first wife, Anna Cropper,
left him when she discovered his infidelity. His second wife, Sara, 
died in her sleep in 2009.

But he insisted: I didn’t have a problem. I could drink gin and tonic, I’d be there until 3 or 4 in the morning. I could get through half a bottle a day.

'I could give it up. I got terrible hangovers. I knew I didn’t have a drink problem, I just drank heavily.'

The
father-of-four said he had stopped his womanising ways by the time he 
had met Sara because he was fed up with it and she knew about his 
previous behaviour.

New love: Roache with his girlfriend, blonde TV weathergirl Emma Jesson

He has a son and a daughter from his first marriage and another son and a daughter with Sara.

They had another child, Edwina, who died at just 18 months old. Mr Roache said the tragedy brought him and Sara closer together.

He was left shocked and devastated after Sara's death.

'We were in bed one night and she just died, no big heart attack or stroke, she just died in my arms.

'It took us nine months to work out her cause of death, and her body stopped producing the chemical to make it beat.

'She
did everything for me and the children, she kept us all together and we
had to pick ourselves up and carry on. It was a very difficult time.'

Screen romances: Ken with Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride) on their wedding day on Coronation Street

Mr Roache has been dating his current girlfriend, TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, for more than a year.

He said: 'There was an instant connection between us. We were immediately comfortable in each other's company and we had good chemistry. So the friendship just progressed from there.'

The
actor, who turns 80 next month, said he plans never to retire.

‘Retiring is not an option. While I can do it and they still want
me. I’ll be there.’

In 1991, Mr Roache sued The Sun for  branding him ‘Boring Ken Barlow’ – a case he won.

He won damages of £50,000, the same amount the paper had offered to settle out of court.

Because
of that, by the rules of libel, Mr Roache was responsible for his own 
£120,000 court costs. Had the jury given him even £5 more, he would have been 
saved a fortune.
