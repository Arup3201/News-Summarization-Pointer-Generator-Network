A pupil who describes himself as an ‘anti-conformist’ had to sit in isolation for more than two weeks at school because of his bleach-blonde Mohican hairstyle.

Oscar Ward, 16, who has sported the style since Christmas, was pulled out of lessons at lunchtime on his first day back at King James’s School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and told to leave.

The Year 11 pupil said he was eventually allowed to stay providing he worked in isolation, a silent removed area reserved for disruptive pupils - where he has even had to sit a GCSE exam.

Oscar said: ‘I’d had four lessons that day and no teachers said anything about my hair. A lunchtime supervisor asked if any staff had spoken to me about my hair and I said “no”.

‘She then went and got my Head of Year. I was originally told I had to go home - but then they said I could work in isolation. That was Tuesday lunchtime. I had to stay in there every school day since.

‘I’ve had a Mohican a while and just dyed it blond last week. I know the school has a policy but it’s really a bit vague. I’m an anti-conformist and I think we have a right to be individuals.

‘Mine is blond. A lot of girls bleach their hair - why is this any different? But then I’ve also been told different reasons why I am in isolation from different teachers.

Isolation: Oscar claims to be an 'anti-conformist' but his headteacher insisted that school policy states 'hair, make-up and style should be kept conventional'

Statement: The headteacher said no other school in the area would accept the haircut 'to my knowledge'

‘Some say it’s the colour, others say the style. I’m concerned that it’s now affecting my education. 

'I’ve had to sit a GCSE exam in isolation and have been given work from lessons or told to copy out of textbooks.’

Oscar’s father Paul Ward, 50, said: ‘We think the rules are a quite vague about suitable hair styles. The thing that shocked us is the speed at which a decision was taken for him to go into isolation.

‘Oscar works really hard at school and putting him in isolation isn’t supporting his education.’

Robert Lamb, headteacher at King James’s School, said: ‘Our policy states very clearly in school diaries that hair, make-up and style should be kept conventional. It says “No unnatural colours, no hair shaved or cut into”. 

'The children are well aware of this rule. This pupil turned up with his hair blonde and shaved when he knew it was against the rules. No other school in the area would accept it to my knowledge. This pupil deliberately broke the rules.’
