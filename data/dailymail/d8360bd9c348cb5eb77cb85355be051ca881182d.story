A driver's road rage attack on a Florida cyclist was captured on surveillance video by a nearby restaurant.

Albert Johnson, of West Palm Beach, was cycling home from work as a chef when he was hit and run off the road by a black Chevy pickup.

After Mr Johnson went around the car to confront Cody Hayes, 28, the driver came out of his car and began attacking the cyclist in the middle of the road.

When I yelled at him, like what are you doing man, he proceeded to drive his vehicle into me crash me into the curb. 

He threw Mr Johnson to the ground before punching him and kicking him in the face during the January incident, according to WPBF.

Surveillance video captured by a nearby Cuban restaurant shows how the cyclist's friend broke up the attack and captured Hayes's license plate number to give to police.

He had been riding in front of Mr Johnson but continued before realizing that his friend was being beaten. 

'(The driver) was like. 'Oh, you want some too?'

Hayes was arrested for battery in February. 

Police say that the driver 'intentionally battered [Johnson] with his vehicle,' according to the Palm Beach Post. He drove off after the encounter.

Mr Johnson did not suffer serious injuries, but was left with a large welt on his head from the incident. 

Aggravated battery is a second degree felony in Florida, punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.
