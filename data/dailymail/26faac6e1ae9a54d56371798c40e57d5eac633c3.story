A series of billboards in Florida erected to warn motorists entering the city of Waldo, for decades known as one of the most notorious speed traps in America, are set to end after the 'corrupt' police force was dissolved.

Until recently, Waldo - described as the 'most corrupt town in America' - had covered half of its $1 million budget by handing out an unusually high number of speeding ticket fines.

The situation was so bad that in 2003, the American Automobile Association had taken the unprecedented step of erecting billboards along Route 310 to warn motorists of the speed traps.

A series of billboards erected by the AAA in Florida  to warn motorists entering the city of Waldo, for decades known as one of the most notorious speed traps in America, are set to end after the 'corrupt' police force was dissolved earlier this month

The nation's leading advocate for traffic safety has said it is now reconsidering that need for the billboards after the city council voted earlier this month to dissolve the police force.

In August, five officers came forward with allegations that Police Chief Mike Szabo enforced a 'strict ticket quota' of 12 tickets for every 12-hour shift.

'Looks like you have some work to do when you come in,' Szabo wrote in an email after an officer recorded only four tickets one day, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Szabo was suspended shortly after by City Manager Kim Worley after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation into another alleged violation of police procedure.

Investigated: Police Chief Mike Szabo sent emails telling officers to follow an illegal quota for speeding tickets

His replacement, Cpl Kenneth Smith, stepped in, only to be hit with a FDLE investigation and suspension of his own. Both Smith and Szabo resigned following their suspensions. 

Patrols in the area are currently being handled by the Alachua County sheriff's office and the AAA has said that it is watching the traffic situation in Waldo closely.

If traffic tickets are written to enhance safety rather than to meet a quota, the AAA has said it will consider ending its lease on the billboards. 

'Assuming the disbanding results in the end of traffic enforcement taking place for the purpose of revenue generation, then we would strongly consider not renewing our billboards there,' Karen Morgan, a public policy manager for the AAA, told AOL Autos.  

As a percentage of its city budget, no other municipality in Florida has relied on traffic citations as heavily as Waldo. 

The tiny town of about 1,000 residents that lies along Route 310 between Gainesville and Jacksonville has derived as much as 73 percent of its overall budget from traffic fines.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement documents say the ideal ratio of police to citizens is 2.5 officers for every 1,000 citizens. Prior to the resignation, Waldo had eight. 

One of the other key factors for AAA is whether the town has mandatory ticket quotas for its officers.

'AAA condemns traffic enforcement practices that are designed to raise revenue rather than prevent crashes,' said Morgan.

'AAA condemns all practices whereby a law enforcement agency rates the efficiency of its officers based upon the number of arrests made or citations issued.'

Waldo had been one of two towns designated by the AAA as a 'traffic trap,' meaning that it considered law enforcement practices to be more focused on generating revenue than enforcing safe driving behavior.

The only other town in the country where the organization has taken the step of buying billboards that warn drivers of a trap ahead is in Lawtey, Florida, about 19 miles north of Waldo along Route 310.
