Husband: John Dewees, 49, is believed to have killed his 45-year-old wife Anja while she was drunk and then took her body to bed in Enfield, Connecticut

A husband who was fed up of changing his alcoholic wife's adult diapers punched her to death in a bathtub and wrapped her body in a deflated waterbed, prosecutors have said.

Army veteran John Dewees, 49, is believed to have killed his 45-year-old wife Anja while she was drunk and then took her body to bed in Enfield, Connecticut.

He is then said to have lived with his dead wife in their house for a few days and put her in the mattress to cover up the smell, according to the Hartford Courant.

Dewees then told neighbours what had happened, and they phoned police.

Officers turned up at the address and found Anja's body inside the deflated mattress which was wrapped in duct tape.

Dewees, a father-of-one, said his wife had been bedridden with liver disease for around four years.

The arrest warrant, issued by Enfield Police Department, said: 'He got up Wednesday and knew Anja was dead but didn't want to call anyone because he wanted to stay with her a couple of days.

'Dewees told me that he pushed Anja into the tub and that she fell onto 
her right side and struck the right side of her head,' it continues.

He said the pair had been drinking vodka and having a good time, but Dewees got angry after she soiled herself, saying she 'spoiled it'.

Initially he told police he went to give her a bath, but then he admitted to pushing her inside the tub and punching her.

'He said he did it because he was tired of changing diapers every day,' the warrant adds.

After he was arrested and charged, police placed him on suicide because he slashed his wrists to 'be in heaven with his wife'.

Public Defender Scott Abkowicz told the judge Dewees was honorably discharged from the US Army and has had a job in the aircraft manufacturing industry for 25 years.

Carl Cianfarani, Dewees's best friend who was sat outside the court, said he was shocked that his friend had been charged with manslaughter because he was a 'very good husband'.

His grown son told reporters outside court that he had abused and hit Anja for as far back as he could remember.
