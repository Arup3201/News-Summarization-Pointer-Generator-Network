Claims: Healthcare assistant Gillian Austin says she was bullied by colleagues for six months after raising concerns about nursing practices

A hospital whistleblower who claims she was bullied by colleagues after raising concerns about nursing practices was offered just 56 pence in compensation to settle her case, a court heard.

Healthcare assistant Gillian Austin, 58, is attempting to sue Southend University Hospital for £185,000 in damages claiming she was subjected to six months of victimisation.

She says she reported a nurse for taking just four-and-a-half hours break between shifts believing it was putting patients at risk.

‘The whistleblowing letter was written
out of concern at the fact she finished her night shift at 7.30am and 
was rostered to start a bank shift at noon,' she told East London Employment Tribunal Service.

‘I felt what she was doing was irresponsible behaviour, and in the letter I described it as extremely dangerous.’

Mrs Austin told the court that as a result of the letter she was made to appear before a disciplinary panel.

She said she was exonerated at her subsequent disciplinary hearing, while the allegations against the nurse were upheld.

But Mrs Austin alleges senior managers instructed colleagues to alienate and bully her as a result.

She resorted to secretly recording conversations with colleagues in a bid to prove she was being victimised.

‘There was alienation, bullying, harassment, and victimisation, and I did have the tapes’, she said.

‘I had them transcribed by a court 
preferred company, and the keywords are all there - evil, manipulative, 
bully, harassment, and liars.

‘The point I am making is under the 
whistleblowing policies, I shouldn’t have been subjected to six months 
of repercussions.'

Mrs Austin was offered a settlement by
the hospital of just 56p, and is now putting this forward as part of 
her collection of grievances.

Dispute: Senior managers at Southend University Hospital instructed colleagues to alienate Mrs Austin following her whistleblowing letter, a court heard

Mrs Austin, who is now on 
antidepressants, says she tried to sort her complaints through human 
resources, ACAS, and with her union, before taking the hospital to 
tribunal.

She lodged an official grievance in 
November 2009 and forced the hospital to appoint an independent assessor
to look at her claims, but said the subsequent report clearing health 
bosses was ‘completely farcical’.

The hospital, which is contesting the allegations, says proper 
procedures were followed in dealing with Mrs Austin’s complaints.

The independent inquiry found the 
whistleblowing procedures had not been correctly followed, but supported
the outcomes of the disciplinary hearings.

The report also noted that Mrs Austen 
had not helped her feeling of becoming isolated from colleagues by 
secretly taping their conversations.

It also found no evidence of intimidation or bullying. 

Mrs Austin has ploughed ahead with the tribunal despite being warned by a judge last year that she has very little chance of winning.

Judge Martin Warren, assessing the 
case last year, ordered the healthcare assistant to pay a £1,000 deposit
to bring the case to tribunal because he believed she should drop her 
claims.

He told her: ‘I really do not think you have a good chance of succeeding, I think you have little prospect of success.

‘If you fail, the respondents will 
undoubtedly make an application for costs and the tribunal, in deciding 
whether to order costs will look at this judgement and the fact that you
were ordered to pay a deposit.’

He warned Mrs Austin, who earns 
£26,000 a year working at the hospital, that she could face a hefty 
costs bill if the tribunal rules against her.

The hearing, which will sit next week, continues.
