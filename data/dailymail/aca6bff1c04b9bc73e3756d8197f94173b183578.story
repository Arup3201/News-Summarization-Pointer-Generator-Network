An Australian company is preparing to roll out hot chip vending machines across the country using a world-first design.

Perth-based Hot Chips Company has been developing the machine for more than five years and believe they have finally created the perfect formula for 'hot, crispy and delicious' chips.

Hot Chips Company CEO Peter Malone said the machine heated up chips that were pre-fried then frozen, and offered a range of condiments including chicken salt, the ABC reported.

'It's robotic technology delivering a cup of hot chips cooked in approximately two minutes to the user, who puts their funds in the front of the machine and get a cup delivered through a hatch,' Mr Malone told the ABC.

'It's essentially a product that is as good as you'll get in any deep fried arrangement anywhere around town.

'And the people using and tasting the product think it's exceptional.'

Mr Malone said there were currently two machines being trialled in Adelaide and two in Perth, with plans to roll out machines nationally before the end of the year.

Eventually the company hopes to take their invention global.

Another Western Australian company, WA Chip/Bendotti Exporters, will supply the chips to the machines.

Stephen Bendotti has spent six years developing the perfect-sized chip and the ideal cooking time and heat

Company director Stephen Bendotti said they had spent six years developing the perfect-sized chip and the ideal cooking time and temperature.

'They've got to be certain size and certain length so it runs in the tubes,' Mr Bendotti told Daily Mail Australia.

The 7mm shoestring fries will be made at the Bendotti plant in Manjimup, 307km south of Perth.

'It comes in as the raw [potato] product then we peel it, slice it into chips, fry it and then freeze it ready to go into the machine,' he said.

Mr Bendotti said another 25 machines will be manufactured next month.

Mr Malone said the company had tried out various prototypes over years of research and development before finding the right design.

In 2013, a 'frites' vending machine was introduced in Brussels, Belgium, but this machine is understood to be a world-first design.
