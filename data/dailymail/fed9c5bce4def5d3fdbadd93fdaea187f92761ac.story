The alleged ringleader of a massive party that trashed the upstate New York home of NFL star Brian Holloway was arraigned before a judge Thursday on felony charges of burglary and criminal mischief.

Seth Hawk, 19, is also facing misdemeanor charges for serving alcohol to minors, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawfully dealing with a child.

He was arraigned before Stephentown Judge Cyril Grant along with five others who have been arrested on charges related to the party, which left up to $40,000 in damages to Holloway's home.

Damages: Here Holloway power washes off graffiti that covered a barn on his property. He estimates the damages will cost at least $20,000 to fix, but likely up to $40,000

All six were released on their own recognizance, according to the Register-Star.

Sgt. Shane J. Holcomb, who is leading the investigation, said not all the partiers were sorry for the damage.

'Some are remorseful; some aren’t,' Holcomb told the Register-Star.

Police expect to charge hundreds of attendees, more than 300 of whom they have already identified through social media posts that the teens were sharing online from the August 31 incident.

All the attendees will face charges and will be 'photographed and fingerprinted,' Holcomb said. Those who come forward on their own will be treated more favorably, he added.

Police believe Hawk (center) was the main ringleader of the massive party, which more than 300 people attended

Holloway said that he had taken Hawk into his family for some time when he was homeless four years ago.

Holloway said he was shocked to learn of Hawk's alleged involvement in the party

In the course of their investigation, police discovered plans for another - even bigger - party in the area planned for September 20. At least 4,000 people were expected to attend the party, which police thwarted after learning of it.

The others who were arraigned on Thursday included 20-year-old Juan Santana and 21-year-old Cody D. Blain, who were each charged with second-degree criminal trespass, providing alcohol to minors, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawfully dealing with a child.

Meghan Loiselle, 18, Mackenzie Grogan, 17, and Keely C. Sullivan, 18, were all charged with felony fourth-degree grand larcey for allegedly stealing a granite eagle statue worth upwards of $1,200, as well as second-degree criminal trespass.

Holloway
said that he had taken Hawk into his home four years ago when he was homeless.

He said hearing about Hawk's involvement 'was a shocker.'

'We're still pulling for him,' he said. 'This may be the thing to get him on track.'

Holloway, 
who played offensive tackle for the Patriots and Raiders in the 1980s, 
gained national attention by reposting party pictures the teens had put 
on social media websites.

He said he posted them on the website 
helpmesave300.com in an effort to get the teens to come forward, take 
responsibility for their actions and change their behavior.

Educational? Hollow invited the teens to his home and posted their names online in order to try to educate them about the dangers of drugs, alcohol, and lawbreaking

Senseless: A bottle of whipped cream flavored vodka was inexplicably in a microwave oven

Determined: ¿We need to take a stand and respond as a community,¿ he said. ¿The next flash party, I guarantee you, is being planned right now, and it's not going to be at my house. It's going to be at someone else's¿

Smashing good time: Windows were smashed throughout the four bedroom home, walls were dented and floors were scratched

Evidence: Many of the estimated 300 teens documented the illegal party by Instagramming and tweeting pictures and messages about the event. Holloway has, in turn, posted the messages on a website he calls HelpMeSave300

'They all committed a crime,' Holloway said. 'There are going to be repercussions that will be significant for some and infinitely significant for others.'

Smashed: Windows appeared to be a favorite target of the rambunctious teens, as they were smashed throughout the property

Word quickly spread: Twitter helped turn the 
party into a drunken madhouse as word of it spread from Albany, New York
to Pittsfield, Massachusetts

Just one? A wrap-around porch was in shambles. Some angry parents say the illegal party was only one of many that have damaged the Holloway's second home

Dirty: Hollow arrived home to his floored covered in booze and eve urine. Some of the 300 partiers say they had no idea the party came after a break-in

Many of the floors required refinishing. Holloway has asked the partying kids to help he make repairs but few have show up

Instead, he said, some parents were angry about his website and there was even a threatened lawsuit.

The
partiers caused at least up to $40,000 in damage to his rural vacation home 
near the Massachusetts border in Stephentown, including broken windows 
and holes in the wall, he said.

Among those who showed up to help Holloway clean were 16-year-old cousins Mikaela Byrnes and Ricky Nelson, of 
Waterford.

'I came 
back to clear my conscience, say "I'm sorry" to him in person, shake his
hand,' Nelson said.'I bought him an apology card, and gave that to him 
from me and Mikaela.'

Nelson
appears in many of the photos of the raucous event that were spread, 
mostly via Twitter, and then made their way onto Holloway's 
HelpMeSave300.com.

Threats: The former NFL linebacker and father-of-eight said he was shocked by the threats from parents who were angry that he posted social media photos of the party online

Teens: The high schoolers took photos of themselves and tweeted about the party. Now Holloway has turned over a mountain of digital evidence to the police

'Tonight was a blur': The teens tweeted in the aftermath of the party, as well. Holloway says he's collected the names of 100 of the estimated 300 attendees and turned them over to police

¿300 dreams can be recovered,¿ says Holloway. ¿The 300 are at a key turning point, the decisions they made to commit crimes, drink illegally, destroy property, selling drugs and do drugs are dangerous decisions¿
