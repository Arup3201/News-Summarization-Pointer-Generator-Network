The wind was blowing in a different direction for England at Edgbaston on Monday when Jos Buttler appeared to become a genuine contender for next week’s first Test just two days after his captain had ruled him out.

At Lord’s on Saturday, Buttler produced the fastest one-day international hundred by an Englishman against the best white-ball bowling attack in the world, but Alastair Cook was quick to play down his Test series chances.

That appeared to be contradicted by England coach Peter Moores on the eve of Tuesday’s deciding match of the Royal London series even though he also made it clear that Matt Prior, who scored 30 for Sussex  before being trapped lbw by Stuart Broad, was still the favourite to play ahead of Buttler next week.

‘Jos played a brilliant innings at Lord’s and to be there and see it was great,’ said Moores, who has the opportunity  today to get his second coming  as England coach off to a victorious start.

‘Jos isn’t the finished article as a keeper but he’s improving quickly and often people aren’t fully developed when they  start. He’s a rapidly improving  cricketer and that doesn’t shock me because I think he’s a highly talented lad. Nothing is set in stone and we don’t want to put ceilings on people. 

‘It was great to see him play like that and we’ll talk when we sit down as selectors about whether that’s enough to get him in the Test team. Jos has certainly pushed his name forward.’ 

So was Cook being overly conservative when he said, in the immediate aftermath of Buttler’s 121 off 74 balls, that he was not yet ready with bat or gloves, a view that was subsequently echoed by the batsman-keeper himself? 

‘I know he didn’t mean to take anything away from the innings,’ said Moores of Cook. ‘He wants Jos to get full credit for that. We know we have some key decisions to make ahead of the first Test and it’s good to see Matt Prior back.

‘The medics will have a say on how Matt’s achilles is after the Sussex match but he has done a lot of work building it up. We wouldn’t want to go into a game thinking there’s a chance our keeper wouldn’t get through it, but if Matt’s fit, he’s a strong contender.’ 

It has been felt since Buttler came into the one-day side that his keeping is some way from Test standard and part of the reason why he left Somerset last winter to join Lancashire was, ironically, to improve his glovework with Moores.

That has not happened at county level because of Moores’ subsequent elevation to become England coach again but Buttler is still at the stage, as Prior was when he first played Test cricket, of having some way to go with the gloves.

Yet Buttler is clearly a special talent and there are echoes here of when Kevin Pietersen came into the one-day team and made a huge impact in a  50-over series in South Africa at the start of 2005. It was said then that his game was not yet suited to Test cricket but England took the plunge with him at the start of the Ashes that year and he quickly justified Duncan Fletcher’s judgment.

It was no surprise to see Pietersen among those advocating Buttler for Test cricket on Twitter, not least because he and Prior do not get on, but England will have to decide whether they can hold back such a gifted stroke-maker any longer in the ultimate game, rough edges or not.

The most gifted gloveman of them all, James Foster of Essex, is clearly very much in the selectors’ thoughts as an alternative to Prior but the selectors will decide when they meet on Wednesday whether Buttler has done enough to leapfrog him.

For now they want to win today’s final one-day international in Birmingham which Moores says, with the series level at 2-2, they will treat as a cup final on an Edgbaston ground where England lost last year’s Champions Trophy final to India under Ashley Giles.

‘It would be lovely to win this game,’ said Moores. ‘We’ve got a World Cup coming up and there will be lots of big games in that so we will treat this as a final. We’ve shown we can beat Sri Lanka but so far we haven’t put the complete game together. I’m confident if we play well we have a pretty good chance.’

The former Lancashire coach then expressed caution about the extraordinary comeback of Andrew Flintoff to his old county, which is expected to see the all-rounder play in the Twenty20 Roses match at Old Trafford on Friday.

‘It’s a sensitive issue with the players who are there,’ said Moores. ‘It’s got to be handled right. A fit, strong Andrew  Flintoff will add to any side  but Lancashire are playing really good cricket at the moment so you’d think it would be difficult to get him in. In the end it’s got to be a cricketing decision.’
