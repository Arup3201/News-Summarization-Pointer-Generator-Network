Members of Congress on the political right are seething over the Obama administration's apparent plan to turn as many as 34 million illegal immigrants into legal U.S. residents, with one lawmaker claiming the president is engaged in 'covert actions to prepare for tens of millions of amnesty cases.'

Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican,said Thursday that recent reports of a government program to mass-purchase blank 'green cards' and work permits are 'proof that the groundwork is already being laid to grant amnesty post-election to millions upon millions of people who have broken our laws to enter this country.'

'The administration already has exceeded its authority to manipulate our immigration laws, and it is jarring to see the sheer scale of his future plans to do more,' he said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a draft proposal this month, seeking a vendor to produce the paperwork that authorizes illegal immigrants to live and work in the United States. The White House is preparing to issue an immigration-related executive order after the Nov. 4 midterm elections.

Along with its solicitation for blank green cards and work permits, USCIS published images showing what the finished cards will look like

According to that online solicitation, the agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum 4 million cards per year for five years, and 9 million in the early stages.

The draft came complete with photos of what the finished cards will look like. 

President Barack Obama has pledged that he will make a move on immigration reform this year. His original timetable called for a decision by the end of the summer. 

Republicans have decried the plan as an 'amnesty' for millions of illegal immigrants, including hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have come across the U.S.-Mexico border this year.

'This revelation provides startling confirmation of the crisis facing our Republic,' Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jeff Sessions said in a statement. 

The Alabama Republican accused Obama of 'preparing to issue work authorization and "legal" status to millions of individuals illegally present in the country, in violation of plain statute,' in a bid to 'nullify the immigration laws of the United States and its sovereign people.'

Barletta, the Pennsylvanian, added that U.S. immigration law serves two purposes: 'to protect the safety of Americans, and to protect American jobs. The president’s covert actions to prepare for tens of millions of amnesty cases undermine both of those principles.' 

USCIS spokesman Christopher Bentley told the Associated Press that the proposal was a routine contract offer.

'Solicitations of this nature are frequent practice,' he said, claiming the number of immigration applications can rise 'for any number of any reasons.' 

Advocates for Mexican and Central American immigrants have lambasted Obama for deporting illegal aliens even though the numbers are down sharply. This Sept. 8 protest in front of the White House featured a crying young boy (left) whose father was deported

Obama delayed his immigration action until after the midterm congressional election to avoid alienating law-and-order voters, but can afford to frustrate illegal imigrants – who can't legally cast ballots 

A USCIS official told MailOnline earlier in the week that the draft was published 'in case the president makes the move we think he will,' but added that the agency's Document Management Division (DMD) is by no means committed to buying the materials.

Another agency official  said the proposal was drafted as a contingency in case immigration reform legislation passes in Congress, not in anticipation of action from the White House.

At the White House on Wednesday, a glib press secretary Josh Earnest claimed the White House does not 'micromanage' the 'ordering of specific colored sheets of paper' by government agencies.

'Don’t be absurd with us,' a CBS News reporter shot back. 'That’s not just an ordinary colored piece of paper. It is central to what the president has promised in public to do in public.'

The online draft explains that 'DMD requires card consumables for the production of USCIS' Permanent Resident Card (PRC) and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) cards.'

'These cards and related consumables, when assembled, become highly specialized and secure identification documents.'

And a successful bid, the draft solicitation says, will be able to support a 'potential "surge" in PRC and EAD card demand for up to 9M (9 million) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements.' 

Green cards are issued once to each recipient. Work authorizations are renewed annually.  

Former State Department foreign service officer Jessica Vaughan, now an immigration expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart.com that the RFP 'seems to indicate that the president is contemplating an enormous executive action that is even more expansive than the plan that Congress rejected in the 'Gang of Eight' bill.'

That legislation, which passed in the U.S. Senate last year only to be stalled in the House of Representatives, was a broad reboot of American immigration policy that won support from a handful of Republicans.

In included a provision to provide a pathway to citizenship for so-called 'dreamers' – people living in the country illegally who were brought to Americans as children before June 15, 2007. 

Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which he ultimately enacted without congressional support, uses the EAD cards as part of its implementation. 

USCIS says it processed 862,000 EADs overall between January and June of this year.

But 'the guaranteed minimum for each ordering period is 4,000,000 cards,' according to the draft RFP.

'The estimated maximum for the entire contract is 34,000,000 cards.'

The company that ultimately wins the contract will also be required to store the blank cards until the government needs them.
