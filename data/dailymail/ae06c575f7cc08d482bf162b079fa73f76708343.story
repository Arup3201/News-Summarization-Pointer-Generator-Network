Nick Clegg, at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow today, wants to lift badly-paid workers out of tax and national insurance 

Millions more middle-class taxpayers should be dragged into the 40p rate and hit with capital gains tax rises to help pay for tax breaks for the lower paid, Nick Clegg will say today.

The Deputy Prime Minister will oppose Conservative plans to offer relief for the millions sucked into the higher rate of income tax.

He will insist increases in the personal allowance and national insurance breaks must take priority over any increase in the threshold for the 40p rate, paid on income over £41,865.

Mr Clegg says the Liberal Democrats would also raise capital gains tax, paid on the sale of assets such as second homes or shares, from 28 per cent to about 35 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers, raising £500 million a year.

The income that can be made before capital gains tax kicks in would also be slashed dramatically, from £10,900 to about £2,500, raising about £250 million a year.

That will drag thousands of people with small savings – such as someone who has worked hard to build up some shares for retirement – into the capital gains tax net.

Mr Clegg’s move opens up a key election dividing line with the Conservatives, who have promised both a hike in the income tax threshold to £12,500 and an increase in the 40p threshold to £50,000 at their conference.

He will say that his party wants to press on with cutting income tax straight away if it remains in government after the election.

The first rise in the personal allowance, taking it to £11,000, should take place in April 2016, he says. This is worth about £100 a year to workers who earn over next year’s income tax threshold of £10,500 a year – roughly 29 million people.

Aides said the 40p threshold would be reduced so that higher-rate taxpayers did not benefit more than those on the basic rate.

‘Everyone will benefit from the increase in the personal allowance, including higher-rate taxpayers, but it’s not right higher-rate taxpayers should do better than everyone else,’ said one.

Mr Clegg has already announced plans to further increase the personal allowance to £12,500 a year by 2020 – a policy matched by the Conservative Party at its conference last week.

The latest YouGov survey shows how just eight per cent of people now say they will vote Lib Dem - down from almost a third at the last election

But after this point, he said the party would make taking more low earners out of paying national insurance a priority – not relief for those on the 40p rate, who now include better-paid nurses, teachers and police officers.

Mr Clegg insisted that tax rises should ‘start at the top and work down, not start at the bottom and work up’.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘You can’t trust a word Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems say. They say they want fairer taxes for working people but in government they have given millionaires a tax break while everyone else pays more.’ 

The Lib Dems have rejected proposals for any new runways in Britain, in a major blow to Nick Clegg.

Activists voted against a change in party policy to support airport expansion in the South East despite Mr Clegg urging supporters to allow a new runway at Gatwick.

But the policy also specified 'no net increase in runways across the UK as a whole'.

Speaking after the vote, Cambridge MP Julian Huppert said the party 'has made a clear decision', adding the issue would be 'an important part of coalition discussions' with other parties if there was another hung Parliament.

Schools minister David Laws said the party would 'respect' the outcome of the vote.

He told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: 'We don't just ignore decisions of our party conference.

'We've debated this twice at party conference, of course we''ll consider on the federal policy committee and on the manifesto committee the precise way in which our commitments on this will be framed.

'But the idea that we're going to ignore this vote is not the way we do things, and the basic approach that we agreed today will go into the manifesto. We're a party that respects the views of our members.'
