It's true that in what seems like the blink of an eye a child is all grown up, so doting father Steve has got in early to ensure he doesn't miss a moment of his son Ray's development.

Adoring dad Steve took a portrait of little Ray every day for his first four years and transformed them into a timelapse video lasting just over two and a half minutes. 

With 1,460 images Steve shows the remarkable evolution of his beaming baby into little boy. 

Baby: Father Steve took a photo of baby Ray shortly after he was born during the summer of 2010

Growing: A few months later in August 2010 baby Ray is starting to look stronger 

Steve's timelapse video is touching way to celebrate his son's life so far, starting with new-born Ray in the summer of 2010 and onwards to a soundtrack of The Beatles' Here Comes The Sun.

Baby Ray begins to grow more hair as the video progresses while his characteristics become more pronounced and his personality begins to shine through. 

During the second minute of the video during 2012 and early-2013 Ray is transformed from a baby to a toddler and he looks much more independent. 

As 2013 concludes and 2014 commences there are images of him standing by the stairs and sitting on his sofa as a happy little infant, all with his head eerily not moving a millimetre. 

Happy: Ray's personality is beginning to shine through at eight months when this photo was taken in early-2011

Independent: As he approaches two years of age Ray is moving about much more and much more grown-up
