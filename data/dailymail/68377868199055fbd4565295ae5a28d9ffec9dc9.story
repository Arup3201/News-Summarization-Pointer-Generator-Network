Always' Super Bowl commercial was supposed to make young girls feel empowered by using the phrase 'like a girl' as a positive description, rather than an insult.

But after it aired during Sunday night's game, sour Twitter users created the hashtag '#likeaboy' to demand they got some attention too.

'Can we get a #LikeABoy commercial too please?,' one Twitter user, Jack Doyle, wrote. 

The commercial contrasts responses from a group of young adults with responses from a group of young girls when they are asked to run, throw and fight 'like a girl'. 

Mocking: For its Super Bowl commercial, Always' asked a group of young people to run, fight or throw 'like a girl' and filmed their mocking responses

Fighters: But when they asked young girls the same thing, their responses were determined and powerful

The first group mock girls by running dramatically, flailing their arms and legs and weakly attempting to throw a  ball.

By contrast, the young girls run, throw and fight with determination.

When one is asked what it means to 'run like a girl', she responds: 'It means run fast as you can.'

But male viewers weren't happy at being left out.

'Seriously #likeagirl is the most insulting commercial ever and there better be a #likeaboy commercial,' Jarred Moore wrote on Twitter.

Thad Castle added: '#LikeABoy because I can actually run and throw.'

'Hopefully one day men can have equality and treated the same #LikeABoy,' Dalton Jones added.

Left out: After it aired, viewers took to Twitter to claim boys should get the same treatment, above and below

As more self-proclaimed 'meninists' - men who believe they need their own movement to counter feminism - ranted about inequality, other viewers started to take note.

'Seconds after #LikeAGirl started trending, someone created #LikeABoy bc masculinity needs constant reassurance & attention,' wrote one user with the handle @WondersFantasy.

Another user named Jae added: 'The difference between like a boy and like a girl is that "#LikeABoy" has never been used as a generalized insult against men.'

Others used the men's new Twitter handle to deride them.

One user, @Emily_Dynamite, wrote: 'When women get a commercial dedicated to feminism and empowerment, get annoyed and start making fun of it #LikeABoy.'

Speaking out: But after their complaints, men and women started fighting back by using the new hashtag

Another, Mikayla, added: 'Throw a tantrum that there's ONE commercial about girls in 4 hour event centered around masculinity #LikeABoy'

Despite the outcry, many Super Bowl viewers commended Always for the empowering advert.

'#LikeAGirl is the best thing to happen. Ever,' wrote Lilly Singh.

Whitney Burns added: 'To boys making fun of the #LikeAGirl commercial: I hope God blesses you with a baby girl and I wanna see you tell her what shes incapable of.'
