Accused: Ricardo Salamanca allegedly told Rosita Rosario, 'that's what you deserve, b****' after he attacked her

A truck driver is accused of slicing off his girlfriend's nose until it hung from her face 'by a thread' after she refused to have sex with him.

Ricardo Salamanca, from Plantation, Florida, flew into a violent rage when Rosita Rosario spurned his advances after an evening out at a local nightclub.

A court heard how he held her in a chokehold and flung her about the room in a terrifying attack before yelling at her: 'That's what you deserve, b****'

Incredibly Miss Rosario then managed to get up and up and drive herself to hospital, despite the blinding pain of her injuries.

There, medics performed emergency surgery on her disfigured face to reattach her nose, Florida's Sun Sentinal newspaper reported.

Salamanca was later arrested and charged with aggravated battery causing bodily harm.

Appearing in Broward County Court, Salamanca listened quietly to the charges laid against him.

'[Miss Rosario's] nose was severed 
down to the sinus cavity, where her nose was only attached by a thread,'
judge John 'Jay' Hurley told him. 'She was trauma alerted to North 
Broward Hospital for surgery to reattach her nose.

'All she can remember is she ran from you. You picked her up and 
threw her across the room.

'Then she realized her face was bleeding 
profusely after that.'

The judge remanded Salamanca in custudy, in lieu of $75,000 bail, citing fears for Miss Rosario's safety.

Three days after the alleged attack of October 28, she filed for a restraining order against him, court papers revealed.

Rosario drove herself to Broward Health Imperial Point hospital and was taken to Broward Health North hospital for surgery. According to the report, she may need further surgery for her nose.
