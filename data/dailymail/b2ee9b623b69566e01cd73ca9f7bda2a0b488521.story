One in four hip replacements may be unsafe, new research has found.

Researchers at Oxford University found that 24 per cent of all hip implants available to surgeons are not backed by evidence of safety or effectiveness.

They also concluded that one in 12 devices that have been used on patients, or around eight per cent, were not backed by information that they were safe.

Metal on Metal: Patients with these hip replacements would need annual checks

The researchers warned that the system for regulating hip implants ‘seems to be entirely inadequate’, almost two years after a widespread scandal resulted in an alert being issued to the NHS.

In February last year, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced almost 50,000 patients with ‘metal on metal’ hip replacements would need annual checks - including blood tests - over concerns they could cause serious health problems.

Those devices were linked to muscle and bone damage and neurological issues. Tiny metal ions made up of cobalt and chromium were thought to break off from the implants and leak into the blood.

Today’s research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), involved a review of all hip implants used in surgery in 2011, taken from the National Joint Registry for England and Wales.

The team concluded: ‘This systematic review of the literature shows that 8 per cent of primary hip replacement prostheses implanted in 2011 and recorded by the National Joint Registry had no readily available evidence relating to their safety or effectiveness.

‘This is likely to be an underestimation of the true problem, as much of the evidence that does exist for the other unrated prostheses is of low quality or relates to short-term outcomes only.

‘This is of great concern, particularly in light of the widespread publicity surrounding recent safety problems with regard to some resurfacing and other large diameter metal-on-metal joint replacements.’

An MHRA spokesman stressed that most patients who have hip replacements are not at risk.

‘The majority of patients who receive hip implants have well-functioning hips and are at a low risk of developing any serious problems,’ he said.

‘The European regulatory system for medical devices such as hip implants is currently being revised and the MHRA has argued that there needs to be more stringent audits and clearer requirements relating to the consideration of clinical evidence.

‘We also want information on the performance of devices to be more transparent and freely available.

‘In addition, a new system called “beyond compliance” is being established that promotes the availability of short- to mid-term clinical data and strengthens the evidence base for new implants in a more transparent manner.

‘This should decrease the complication and the revision rates that may be associated with newly introduced hip implants, resulting in better patient care, better patient quality of life and decreased costs to the health services.’
