It's on the brink of extinction throughout Australia and while most people will never get the chance to see a tiger quoll in the wild, the rare animal has been captured on camera in bush in the Hunter region in NSW.

As part of the Watagan survey, University of Wollongong researchers set up 90 sites with motion-activated cameras in isolated and urban areas in the Watagan area in the hope of getting a glimpse of Australia's biggest marsupial carnivore.

Research team member Katarina Mikac told Daily Mail Australia as the anaimals are listed as endangered, there is a possibility the tiger quoll could become extinct within a decade.

Nine endangered tiger quolls, including the one pictured, were captured by motion-activated cameras  in Watagan Mountains bushland over the summer months, lured by the smell of chicken wings

Using chicken wings as bait, nine tiger quolls were lured towards the cameras and captured in Watagan Mountains bush, south west of Newcaslte.

'The wings weren't accessible - the quolls pretty much come and smell the bait and have a look around and then leave,' Ms Mikac said.

The cameras used by the researchers were similar to those use by police in the hunt for Australia's previously most wanted fugitive Malcolm Naden, while he was hiding in Barrington Tops bushland in 2012.

In one of the images, a tiger quoll can be seen wandering the bush floor, with a native lyrebird in the background, while another climbs a stump.Â 

While the research has been hailed a success, tiger quolls are endangered and could become extinct with a decade. Pictured is a second tiger quoll captured by the cameras during the survey

The survey was conducted over the summer with an aim of establishing if and where quolls live in the Watagan area.

'We don't know much about the habitat and area so we're just doing a blanket survey at the moment,' Ms Mikac said.

'Historical records occur all up and down the eastern seaboard but some sightings are quite old. Since European settlement, their numbers have declined - we know roughly where they are, it's just a matter of updating sightings.'

As the team was looking for an endangered species, Ms Mikac said she did not expect to see too many of the animals but that nine was a strong number. 'It was certainly a good sign of population,' she said.

'I would say the study is a success, I have colleagues working with endangered species who can go four years without seeing an animal.'

Since European settlement, tiger quolls numbers have declined, but the animals can still be found primarily in NSW and stretching to Victoria and Queensland

Ms Mikac said she was confident the quolls captured by the cameras were all different and that the research method was appropriate for a first attempt.

'We set the traps quite a distance away from each other - about half a kilometre apart,' she said.

All nine sightings occured in the bush areas, but the researcher said despite not seeing any in urban areas, the area of bush was popular with campers, bush walkers and dirt bike riders.

The sightings will allow the researchers to monitor the numbers to better manage the populations.

'Now that we've don't this, we can do a much more targeted survey and research of the species in general,' she said.

However, Ms Mikac said she could not make a conclusion at this stage on tiger quoll numbers or habitat preference in NSW.

She said an unrelated nine-year survey from the Batemans Bay area to the Victorian boarder only found 19 of the animals, but added there could be many variables contributing to this number.

With the Watagan research finished, the team is now shifting their next research area to the Illawarra area south of Sydney.

She said there had been reported sightings in this area in recent years.

NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service (WIRES) spokesperson Justin McKee said in the past year, two tiger quolls had come into the organisation's care.

'One in Parramatta and one in the Blue Mountains,' he said. 'It's an uncommon species to come into care. Two in a year is pretty normal - it's about as infrequent as we get them. To spot them is very rare.

'They have very large territories. They live in isolation and live solitary lives. Their existence in Sydney would be quite low.'

Tigers quolls can also be found in Victoria and Queensland.

In February a tiger quoll was filmed in the Grampians National Park in Victoria shortly after bushfires raged through a third of the park.

The animals were thought to have been locally extinct as the species had not been seen in the Grampians area in more than 140 years, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

Taronga Zoo senior catcher Wendy Gleen said the International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates there are about 20,000 tiger quolls left.

But Ms Gleen said what the population numbers were doing was more important than the actual amount, and in the case of the tiger quoll, numbers were decreasing.

She said the zoo has a pair of female tiger quolls and its focus is on education. 'We try and inspire people to take action,' she said.

Ms Gleen said the people who live in areas where there are tiger quolls can help by connecting fragments of bush important to the animals' survival.

'Planting locally native plant species or joining bush regeneration groups,' she said and added this was particularly important because of the animals' massive home ranges of up to 500 hectares.

On the back of the tiger quoll sightings, she said it was 'fantastic' that the animals were living relatively close to Sydney and that land owners in the Watagan area had a unique opportunity to help the animals.

'With land clearing for hobby farms and properties, there's scope for land owners to have an impact by retaining natural vegetation,' she said.

Despite quolls sometimes getting into chicken coops, she added that people needed to remember the animals were a highly threatened species.
