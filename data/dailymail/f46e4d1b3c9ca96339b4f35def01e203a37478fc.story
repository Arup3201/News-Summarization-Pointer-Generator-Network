A window cleaner is suing one of Britain's biggest ever lottery winners – over an alleged unpaid bill of £375.

Steve Rix claims £56million jackpot winner Nigel Page withheld payment because a member of the cleaning team took a picture of one of his sports cars.

Mr Rix, 57, says his staff spent four hours polishing mirrors, wiping down glass staircases, and cleaning swimming pool windows in Page's £5million rural eco-mansion.

But an hour after he left he got a call from the estate manager, Danny Baker, who told him that CCTV footage captured one of the workers photographing a McLaren sports car.

Mr Rix, who earns £13,000 a year, says he apologised and ensured the image was deleted - but claims Page refused to pay due to the 'breach of privacy'.

He said yesterday: 'That money is nothing to him but to me it's half a month's wages.

'To come up with such a petty reason not to pay is just ridiculous.

'He probably earns the money he owes every minute in interest. There's no reason for him not to pay up.'

Nigel Page, 48, won £56million on the EuroMillions jackpot in 2010 - the UK's sixth biggest windfall.

The former property maintenance worker married Justine Page, 45, shortly after the win, and they moved into the six-bedroom Cotswolds home, near Bibury, Gloucestershire.

It has a swimming pool, a 25-seat cinema, and vast grounds.

Mr Rix says he was asked to clean glass inside the home by Mrs Page in May, a one-off commission that took four of his workers four hours to carry out.

They were followed around the property by the housemaid who told them that the glass had never been so clean.

But in spite of their apparent good work, Mr Rix was told they would not be paid for their work after a 'breach of privacy'.

He said recalled: 'On the way out one of the lads saw a McLaren F1 car. He hadn't seen anything like it before so he took a picture on his phone.

'After Mr Page saw the incident on CCTV he went mad and we were told they wouldn't be paying us.

'To use a reason like that is ridiculous. That car is often seen out on the public highways, driving around.

'He didn't include the registration plate or any of the house in it either. At no point were we told there were to be strictly no pictures.

'They kept refusing to pay. That money is the equivalent of a week's wages for one of my lads.'

Mr Rix launched a case at the small claims court on October 2 and Page has 14 days - until October 16 - to respond.

Mr Rix, who has been running Bourton Vale Window Cleaning Services for 20 years, added he has lots of rich and famous clients and none have ever acted like this before.

He said: 'We do a lot of famous and rich people and we have their keys. Everything we do, we do on trust.'

Nigel and Justine Page are currently out of the country and have been unavailable for comment, although a family member said it was 'unlikely' they would have anything to add.

Answering the intercom at their house, the Pages' estate manager Danny Baker said: 'I don't really want to comment on this other than the fact it was a breach of security as made out when he first arrived on site.'

He added it was Mr Rix's 'prerogative' to take them to court if he wished.

A few months after Mr Page's massive lottery win, he was the subject of legal action from his ex-wife Wendy, who then received £2million of his winnings despite leaving him for another man ten years previously.
