Hundreds of holidaymakers have been forced to leave a holiday park after it was closed due to an outbreak of a vomiting bug.

Around 600 people were evicted from The River Dart Country Park, in Ashburton, Devon, where 91 cases of sickness had been reported since Friday.

On its website, the park said it would be closed until 18 August to 'enable further investigations'.

It added that about 600 people would leave the site later and apologised for the disruption caused.

On its Facebook site, Emily Rudd, who said she had stayed at the park, wrote: 'We camped last week and this bug wiped my two little girls, myself and my husband out.

'Our tent and bedding was ruined from all the sickness and in the end we cut our holiday short and came home. We are also hoping for compensation.

'Disappointing as we have visited before and had a great holiday and wish to do so again in the future.

'We hope those affected are reimbursed and the river dart team can rectify the problem quickly.'

Mark Simpson, managing director, said the decision to close was made after discussions with Public Health England.

In the statement, he said: 'The Management Team and I have jointly taken the decision to close River Dart Country Park until Monday 18th August 2014.

'This will enable further investigation into the suspected Noro-type virus, which was unwittingly brought on to our site, to continue and a deep clean of the whole site ... be undertaken.

'Our primary concern is naturally for the welfare of our visitors and we have not taken this very difficult decision without serious consideration.

'I fully appreciate that this will cause unforeseen disruption to many holiday and day visitor plans for which I can only apologise.

'We will fully reopen 9.30am Monday 18th August and look forward to welcoming you all at the Park.

'Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.'

Dr
 Sarah Harrison, of the 
Devon, Cornwall and Somerset Public Health England Centre, said: 
'Norovirus, which we suspect is causing people to become unwell, usually
 leads to mild diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal or stomach cramps that 
people recover from quickly.

'There is no specific treatment, but if affected, it is important to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.'
