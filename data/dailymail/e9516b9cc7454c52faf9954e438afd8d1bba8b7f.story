Elizabeth Taylor's astonishing 
jewellery collection fetched a record-breaking $115million (£75million) 
at auction in New York - including more than $11.8million for a pearl necklace and 
$8.8million for a diamond ring, both given to her by Richard Burton.

The necklace was made to display a historic pearl known as 'La Peregrina', which Burton bought for Taylor in 1969 and which cost him $37,000 
(£23,000).

Last night the necklace fetched a world record price of
$11,842,500 (£7.6million).

It had been estimated to sell for 
$2million to $3million at the auction at Christie's of 
jewels, clothes and other memorabilia amassed by the late actress.

The pear-shaped La Peregrina is widely considered to be one 
of the most important pearls in the world. It dates 
from the 16th century, was painted by Velasquez and belonged to King Phillip II of Spain 
and to Queen Mary I.

Burton worked with Cartier to have it hung on the diamond and ruby 
necklace.

The 33.19-carat diamond ring, also 
given to Taylor by Burton, whom she married twice, was bought by a 
private buyer from Asia for $8,818,500 (£5.6million).

Thomas
W Burstein of Christie's said the only time the ring left 
Taylor's hand was when she offered it to friends to try on.

Taylor, a screen goddess who was a 
child star in National Velvet and went on to classics such as Cleopatra 
and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, died in Los Angeles in March at the
age of 79.

One of the world's most beautiful 
women, she was married eight times and was showered with jewels by 
admirers. Her famous collection includes pieces from Cartier, Van Cleef 
& Arpels and Chopard.

Her possessions going under the hammer span five decades and tell the story of her eventful life, from the couture frocks worn 
during her two weddings to Burton, to the dazzling ruby and diamond 
Cartier jewellery set which was a gift from her third husband, film producer Mike
Todd.

Making an entrance: The Collection of Elizabeth Taylor - an exhibition 
of her clothes and jewellery - was taken on a worldwide three month tour before the auction

Other tokens from admirers include 
jewellery and an autographed poster from Taylor's cherished friend, 
Michael Jackson. The 1987 print is signed: 'To my true love Elizabeth. I
love you forever.'

A diamond bracelet given to the actress by Jackson, 
with an estimated sale price of $30,000 to $50,000, went for $194,500 
(£125,500). A diamond and sapphire ring which was a gift from the singer fetched $600,000 (£388,000).

The collection has been on exhibition in the UK, Moscow, Los Angeles, Dubai, Geneva, Paris and Hong 
Kong as part of a three-month global tour ahead of the auction.

The exhibition 
is also a journey through Taylor's evolving fashion sense, from her 
glamorous red carpet gowns to beaded Versace jackets, a sea of gold Hermes bags, 
sequin Chanel clutches and satin Louboutins.

Meredith Etherington-Smith, curator 
of Taylor's fashion collection, called the display a glimpse into 
Taylor's 'tempestuous, fabulous, technicolor personality that epitomizes
gutsy glamour'.

Other sales of Taylor's art, clothing
and memorabilia will be held later in the week.

Thomas W. Burstein of Christie's said Taylor 'really had this notion that the jewelry should be shared and loved by everybody.'

Fashion collectors will have the opportunity to purchase unique designs such as a Versace 
beaded evening jacket adorned with portraits of the actress in some of 
her famous movie roles, estimated to sell for up to $20,000, and the sunflower yellow dress by 
Hollywood designer Irene Sharaff that Taylor wore to her 1964 wedding to
Burton, boasting a pre-sale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000.

A
total of 269 pieces from her jewellery collection are up for auction while 400 fashion items spanning over 50 years of Taylor's life will also be sold.

Some 950 of the star’s more affordable personal belongings are the subject of bidding online, with many items still below $1000. They include an art deco bracelet and a white and gold diamond.

£250-£370: Navajo silver necklace

£1,240: Gold and pearl bird brooch

£185-£310: Lanvin patent leather bag

They will be placed into one of four 
categories – fine jewellery, fashion and accessories, costume jewellery 
and decorative arts and memorabilia – and will be featured on the 
website for Christie’s from Friday.

Bidding will take place over a two-week period.

The
auction at christies.com will work in a similar way to eBay – whoever 
has the highest bid at the end of the bidding time will win the item.

Another piece in the online sale is a
green linen embroidered kaftan that Taylor wore to publisher 
Malcolm Forbes’s 70th birthday party in Morocco.

The bash cost an 
estimated £1.5million with Forbes chartering a Boeing 747, a DC-8 and a 
Concorde to fly in 800 of the world’s rich and famous from New York and 
London.

Miss Taylor was his co-host.

Other
pieces for sale include 22 handbags by Dior and Valentino, 500 pieces 
of fine and costume jewellery and 400 more designer fashion items.

Part of the proceeds will go to The 
Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, which she established in 1991 to help 
people living with AIDS.

Taylor's collection of impressionist and modern art is scheduled to go on sale at Christie's in London in February.
