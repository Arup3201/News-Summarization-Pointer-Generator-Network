Police have released CCTV images of a suspect they wish to trace in connection with the attempted robbery of the mother and sister of Myleene Klass

TV presenter Myleene Klass is urging members of the public to help find the thug who dragged her pensioner mother along the floor and attempted to steal her sister’s handbag in a terrifying street attack.

The distressing incident occurred as the former Hear’Say singer’s 67-year-old mother Magdalena and her sister Jessie, 33, were walking along a north London road on January 7. 

The suspect eventually fled the scene empty-handed but only after Klass’s sister was assaulted as she resisted the attack, Scotland Yard said.

A police spokesman said: ‘The male assaulted her, he dragged her to the ground, pulling her along the pavement and continued to assault her.

‘A 67-year-old woman tried to hold on to the victim and was also dragged along during the violent struggle.’

Police have now released CCTV images of a man they are keen to trace in connection with the incident which happened at around 9.30pm in Whittingham Road, Wood Green.

Singer-turned-TV presenter Ms Klass, who has recently joined the Loose Women panel, is hoping the images might encourage witnesses to come forward.

She said: ‘I am horrified by what happened to my mum and sister, as anyone would be if this were a member of their own family, and I urge any person that knows anything or can help in any way to please come forward.’

Her sister received minor injuries from the assault but did not require hospital treatment.

Both women were very distressed by the incident but no items were stolen, Scotland Yard said. No arrests have been made.

Detective Constable Pat Dunne said: ‘This was a terrifying attack on two women on a main road. I’m confident someone will be able to identify the suspect pictured in the images released today.’

Anyone with information about the attempted robbery can contact police on incident hotline number 0203 2763070.
