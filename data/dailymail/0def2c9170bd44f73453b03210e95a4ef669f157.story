A young Somali-American woman is believed to have fled her home in Minnesota to join Islamic State militants fighting in Syria.

Prosecutors in  St Paul yesterday charged 20-year-old Yusra Ismail with stealing a friend's passport to travel to the conflict zone. She was not present at the hearing, having left the U.S. on August 21.

The criminal complaint alleged that Ismail used the stolen U.S. passport to fly to the Netherlands and Norway last August. On August 24 she contacted family members to tell them that she had subsequently travelled on to an area of Syria under the control of the Islamic State terror group.

Prosecutors said there is no record of Ismail, who is not a
U.S. citizen, returning to America after using the stolen passport to leave the country last August.

She had booked a return ticket, according to the complaint, but there is no record of anyone ever using that ticket to board a flight back to the United States.

Omar Jamal, a Somali community advocate in the Twin Cities who has spoken with Ismail's family, told TwinCities.com that she is 'a very young girl' who was 'really confused.' 

He said her family is 'a little bit shocked' that she left for Syria, adding 'she was radicalized... she was brainwashed.'

U.S. authorities have long held concerns about the number of young Somali-Americans traveling from the Minneapolis area to join Islamic extremist groups fighting abroad.

Until recently, however, those leaving the large community of East African expatriates in the area have mainly joined Al Shabaab - the militant Al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia.

Route: A  number of Somali-Americans are believed to have left Minneapolis Saint Paul Wold Chamberlain International Airport in Minnesota to travel to Europe and subsequently join the Islamic State in Syria

Terrorists: Last summer, FBI officials said they had begun tracking a trickle of Somali-Americans from the Twin Cities area to Syriain in general, and to areas held by the Islamic State (pictured) in particular

Ismail's case comes one week after the same office charged two young Minnesota men of Somali ancestry with supporting the Islamic State.

Abdullahi Yusuf, 18, was stopped at Minneapolis airport before he could board a plane to Turkey - the country most would-be jihadists pass through to reach terror group's Syrian strongholds.

Agents are still looking for 20-year-old Abdi Nur, a contact of Yusuf's - who boarded a plan to the Turkish capital Istanbul the day after his friend's arrest and has not yet returned to America.

Last summer, FBI officials said they had begun tracking a
trickle of Somali-Americans from the Twin Cities area to Syria
in general and to Islamic State-held areas in particular.

FBI Director James Comey said last month his agency was
tracking close to 150 Americans it believed had traveled to
Syria.

A federal official said authorities believe about a dozen
Americans were fighting there with ISIS.
