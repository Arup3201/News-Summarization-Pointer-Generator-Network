The Queen might spend her holidays at Balmoral but the rest of the world's royals have considerably more exotic tastes, with beautiful beaches and stunning scenery high on their checklist.

Caribbean islands Mustique and St Barts are hugely popular with the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Beatrice among regular visitors, while the island of Ibiza played host to the Wessexes earlier this summer.

The French Riviera is another popular spot with royal holidaymakers, among them Sweden's Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland, while Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco like to holiday in rustic Norway or venture south to Portofino.

More still, among them Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, plump for staycations in pretty parts of their home country.

But you don't have to be blue-blooded to snap up a sun lounger with the royal seal of approval. Whether you're in the UK or further afield, FEMAIL reveals where to spot a prince (or princess) this summer.

COOL CARIBBEAN

With its sugar-sand beaches and gently swaying palms, it's no surprise that the Caribbean has proved a hit with holidaying royalty. A particular favourite is St Barts, which earlier this year saw Princess Beatrice arrive on its shores for a break.

Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia.

‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' says MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon.

Paradise: The tiny island of Mustique has long been popular with royal holidaymakers such as the Duchess of Cambridge and also has scores of celebrity fans

‘While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot.

‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere.'

Almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of Mustique, which in January this year, was the scene of Prince George's first ever trip abroad.

While the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his Middleton relatives, his great aunt Princess Margaret, another royal fond of a Mustique break, sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island.

SUNNY SPAIN

From the Prince of Wales to Princes William and Harry, nearly all of the senior British royals have enjoyed Spanish holidays at one point or another, although the most recent visitors were the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

The couple were photographed enjoying a relaxing break in July aboard a luxury yacht moored off the tiny uninhabited island of Espalmador, close to Ibiza, which is famous for its naturist beaches and mud baths.

Also fond of an Ibiza getaway are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who in 2010 stayed at a villa on the Spanish island belonging to Kate’s colourful uncle Gary Goldsmith – the infamous Maison de Bang Bang.

Almost as infamous is the Spanish resort of Magaluf on nearby Mallorca - a favourite summer spot of the Spanish royal family who own two palaces on the island.

King Felipe and Queen Letizia are currently staying at the Marvient Palace with their two daughters and spend most of the time relaxing on the beach or enjoying days out in and around the capital Palma.

Past visitors to the Spanish royals at the Marvient have included the Prince of Wales and the late Princess Diana, who joined them for a holiday in Mallorca in 1988 and again in 1990.

Along with their children - a three-year-old Prince Harry and a five-year-old William - the royal couple spent time on the family yacht Fortuna, sold off in 2010, with Prince Charles photographed teaching Harry how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest, King Constantine of Greece.

FANS OF FRANCE

From Monaco to St Tropez, Toulouse and Marseilles, France has no shortage of glamorous places to stay and both celebrities and royals have taken note.

Although Princess Charlene and Prince Albert of Monaco are regularly spotted in their principality, other royals, among them Sweden's Prince Carl Philipe, are more infrequent visitors.

Last month, the Swedish prince was spotted
 holidaying on a yacht off the French coast and appeared to enjoy the 
experience, beaming broadly as he scrambled back on board to join his fiancee, former glamour model Sofia Hellqvist.

Family break: Last year, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians chose to take their young family on holiday in the picturesque Île d'Yeu off the Vendée coast

Other vistors include Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, both of whom are fond of holidaying in St Tropez - often with their mother Sarah Ferguson and respective boyfriends.

More unusual locations for a French break include the Île d'Yeu, a pretty island just of the Vendée coast of western France, which last year played host to King Phillippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians and their children, Elisabeth, Emmanuele, Gabriel and Eléonore.

ITALIAN GETAWAYS

Italy has long been a popular holiday destination for the A-list but the country has also proved a hit with royal holidaymakers among them the Wessexes and Princess Charlene of Monaco.

Although the Earl and Countess of Wessex chose Ibiza this year, last year the couple and their two children Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn, were photographed enjoying a break in beautiful Tuscany.

Equally popular with royal visitors are 
the upmarket resorts of Portofino and Capri, with Monaco's Princess 
Charlene enjoying a pre-baby break with friends in Portofino.

Afterwards, Charlene went on to spend a couple of days on a yacht off the coast of Sardinia, close to the spectacularly pretty little town of Olbia, before joining Prince Albert for a holiday at the Kragerø Resort and Spa near Telemark in southern Norway.

Other royals to visit include Prince Harry who earlier this year visited Rome for an official engagement to honour British and Commonwealth troops who fought and died at the battle of Monte Cassino.

Along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he is expected to return to the country in September for the wedding of close friends, nightclub owner Charlie Gilkes and his fiancee Anneke von Trotha Taylor, in Puglia.

ROYAL STAYCATIONS

The Queen is famous for her summers at Balmoral but the Prince of Wales is just as fond as spending his time off in Scotland, albeit at his own summer home, Birkhall.

Joined by the Duchess of Cornwall and their grandchildren, the heir to the throne has spent the summer walking, fishing and watching the Highland Games while enjoying a dram or two of whisky along the way.

And it seems that the prince has passed his fondness for staycations on to his sons, both of whom have remained in the UK during August, with the Duke of Cambridge splitting his time between London and Berkshire and Prince Harry confining himself to the capital.

Not that Prince Harry has lacked entertainment: Along with a foray to the Secret Garden Party in the pretty village of Abbots Ripton in Cambridgeshire, the prince was also photographed enjoying a pint at the Great British Beer Festival in London.

Other royals who prefer to spend their summers at home include Denmark's Queen Margrethe, who is a regular visitor to the North Sea resort of Skagen in northern Denmark.

Her son, Crown Prince Frederik, and his Australian wife Mary also chose a patriotic destination in the shape of Greenland, where they were photographed meeting locals while wrapped up warm against the chilly temperatures.

The Swedish royals are also fans of a staycation, with glamorous Princess Madeliene among regular visitors to the beautiful seaside town of Marstrand on the West Sweden coast.
