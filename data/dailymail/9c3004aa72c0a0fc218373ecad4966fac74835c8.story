A woman who shot her lover has beaten an attempted murder rap and avoided years of jail time after her lovelorn partner refused to testify against her.

Evelyn Barnave, 43, of Brooklyn was slapped on the wrist with an assault conviction Monday, skirting what had been a potential seven years in jail.

But while love may have conquered the penal system, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Matthew D’Emic threw cold water on the fiery relationship when he told boyfriend turned gunshot victim Randolph Costa to stay away from Barnave for a full year.

The New York Post reports that Justice D'Emic forbade Costa from contacting the shooter he loves in any way, be it by email, voice calls, or text messages.

While Costa implored the judge at Monday's sentencing, via Barnave's attorney Paul Hirsh, to be allowed to address the court in an effort to garner his lover a light sentence, his request was denied.

It was Justice D'Emic's belief that, in taking their armed domestic conflict into the outside world, the couple had endangered the greater community and should therefor be kept apart.

'The problem that I have is that we have a situation here where these two parties have a tumultuous relationship and if it stayed between these two that would be one thing,' Justice D’Emic said.

Barnave was facing an attempted murder charge for shooting Costa in 2011.

After a fight over a joint checking account, Barnave shot Costa at close range through the window of her car in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn on January 11 of that year.

59-year-old Costa initially pointed the finger at his girlfriend, but then refused to cooperate with prosecutors in her trial at Brooklyn 
Supreme Court despite a fight that left him with a bullet in his spine.

Meanwhile, Barnave insisted the whole 
thing was an accident and the prosecution in her case was left unable to
make the attempted murder charge stick.

Barnave was sentenced for the lesser charge of reckless assault last month.

But that didn't mean the judge was going to let the lovebirds go celebrate Barnave's freedom.

'This
spilled out into the streets of Brooklyn where an innocent person could
have gotten hurt,' explained the judge as he handed down his stay-away 
order.

'I love this man 
and he loves me,' an emotional Barnave told the judge. 'I have a family 
and I have never hurt anybody or done anything malicious to anybody in 
my life.'

Barnave and Costa met about five years ago on a Subway platform.

In June, when Costa suddenly decided he wouldn't testify, he said it was because he hoped they would get married one day.

Now, despite the judge's order, Costa told the Post he was satisfied with the ruling.

'I’m
not disappointed that we can’t see each other,' Costa said. 'I’m just 
relieved that she didn’t get jail time. It could have been a lot worse.'

Barnave thanked the judge for the sentence that allows her to avoid jail.

'I just want to thank you judge,' she said. 'It was an accident.'

To the press, Barnave would only say, 'It's fine,' before she left the court without the man she loves.

Justice D'Emic said he would be willing to revisit the stay-away order in a year.
