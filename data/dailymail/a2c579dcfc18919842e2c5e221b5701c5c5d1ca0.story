'It's nice to see this moment,' Djokovic said, after advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open. 

'I'm sure he was very happy when she said yes.'

One of the commentators said that the man appeared to be quite nervous.

'Was it because it [the proposal] was inside the stadium or because she might have said no?' he asked.

'It was not long ago that Djokovic was in a similar situation,' the commentator said.

The 27-year-old Serbian-born sportsman exchanged vows with Jelena Ristic in the grounds of Montenegro's Aman Sveti Stefan resort in July.

The pair met when they were in high school in 2005 and dated for almost nine years before announcing their engagement and the birth of their first child.

'The wedding was everything we hoped it would be. Our family and closest friends united in a beautiful setting in celebration of our love. It was truly emotional and unforgettable for us,' his new wife told OK Magazine.

Djokovic said that it wasn't the first marriage proposal to occur during one of his matches.

'I think it happened maybe once prior to this match in my whole career that someone proposed,' he said.

'It's one of these moments you remember forever. Not just for them, but for everybody who was there.' 

Djokovic seemed to take direction from the newly engaged couple, wishing his mother a happy birthday after beating Verdasco, the number 31 seed in three straight sets.

While being interviewed in the post-match Q&A, he asked if the crowd would sing his mother a happy birthday.

The crowd joined him in singing to her, and the world number one laughed as he sang to the camera and blew his mother a kiss.
