The father of NSA whistleblower Eric Snowden publicly appealed for his son to come home and begged him to stop leaking classified government information.

Lonnie Snowden, 52, said in an interview on Sunday that he was also against surveillance programs being carried out on U.S. citizens. However he pleaded with his 29-year-old son, a former NSA employee, to come home despite the fact that he may face a prison sentence.

Snowden, 29, has been hiding out in Hong
Kong since the start of this month when he outed himself as the
person who leaked classified information about the NSA's surveillance.

Plea to his son: Lonnie Snowden, the father of NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden, holds up a picture of his son as a young boy as he begged him to return to the U.S.

Lonnie Snowden told Fox & Friends: 'I’m here because I’m really 
concerned about the misinformation in the media. He 
is a sensitive, caring young man... He just is a deep thinker.'

Mr Snowden said that his son was not a high school drop-out as has been reported but had missed several months of teaching because he was ill during his sophomore year. He completed his high school equivalency at a community college.

Lonnie Snowden has other children and is keen to protect their identities following the scandal, he said.

Mr Snowden senior also said that he is against any government surveillance program that snooped on its citizens emails and text messages. 

He said: 'In my opinion, they have no right. Not even under the guise of, ''We need to keep you safe.'' … Don’t tread on us.'

The
concerned father begged his son to return to the U.S. despite the 
threat that he may face a prison sentence, telling him not to leak or 
say anything more.

Underground: Snowden, 29, is currently hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM program

Shortly after Edward Snowden made the revelations, federal agents visited the Pennsylvania home of his father and stepmother.

The 29-year-old is currently hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM program, which monitors millions of American citizens, to the media.

His decision to reveal the national secrets have also left his girlfriend Lindsay Mills, 28, completely devastated.  Lindsay had previously written on her blog about how she was ‘adrift’ at losing Snowden who she described as her ‘mystery man’.

Family members have said that Lindsay is currently with friends on the West Coast, though she could still be in Hawaii, where she and Snowden had been living together.

He never told Mills about his plan - saying only that he needed to leave for a few weeks and offering a vague explanation.

The shocking leak of classified surveillance programs has sent shock waves through the nation.

Some have hailed Snowden as a hero. Several high-profile members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, are calling him a traitor, including former VP Dick Cheney. 

His whereabouts are currently unknown - though he is believed to still be in Hong Kong.
