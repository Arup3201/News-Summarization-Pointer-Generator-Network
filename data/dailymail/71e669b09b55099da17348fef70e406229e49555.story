Scientists in Denmark believe an antidote for cocaine could be possible, after they identified a key protein that helps cause addiction (file picture)

It is an addiction that tears families apart, destroys lives and leads to financial ruin. 

Now, a team of scientists believe they are a step closer to developing an antidote to cocaine addiction.

Researchers at the University of Copenhagen have identified a protein - a dopamine transporter - that could help in the development of future treatments.

Currently no medical treatment exists to combat a reliance on the drug. 

In theory, the new treatment would work in a similar way to how methadone works for heroin addicts.

In essence, the treatment would stop the drug having any pleasurable effect.

Associate professor Claus Juul Loland, from the department of neuroscience and pharmacology, said though the drug is not a 'wonder drug' it would work in a similar way to how methadone is used to treat heroin abuse.

'If we have a better understanding of the dopamine transporter function we will become more proficient in developing an antidote against cocaine addiction,' he said.

'It would aid in the treatment of cocaine addiction, but the patient would have to be willing to go to rehab and other actions have to be taken in addition to this,' he told Medical Daily. 

He added: 'We found two amino acids in the proteins that dynamically breaks and forms an interaction.

'The dynamic is therefore crucial for the transport process.' 

Cocaine acts as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter. 

Dopamine is a signalling molecule in the brain which is linked to a person's sensation of reward, motivation, and addiction.

The newly-discovered protein acts as a 'vacuum cleaner' removing the released dopamine, thereby controlling its signalling.

The scientists discovered an interaction, a so-called gate, which controls access for dopamine to its binding site in the protein.

But the scientists discovered other inhibitors, which though they bind to the dopamine transporter with the same strength as cocaine, do not provoke the same simulatory response, when tested in rats.

'Our objective here is that cocaine will not then work any more as the antidote will inhibit the stimulatory response of taking this drug,' concluded Professor Loland.

He added further research will be necessary.

The results have been published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.
