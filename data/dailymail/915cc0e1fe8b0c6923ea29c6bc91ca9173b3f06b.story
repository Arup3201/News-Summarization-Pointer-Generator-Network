Forget leaving intimacy for the bedroom, one group of adventurous Germans has admitted that the bathroom is their preferred place for lovemaking.

In a survey for German television channel Kabel-1's 'Adventure Life' show 17 per cent of those polled said that they love to have sex in the bathroom.

Most of the respondents were more traditional, with 77 per cent choosing the bedroom as their favourite place for shenanigans, according to a report on thelocal.de.

One in five Germans have admitted that their favourite place to have sex is the bathroom

A car crazy nine per cent liked to get their fix in an automobile while only one per cent admitted to mixing work and pleasure and having erotic adventures in the office.

The survey also found that Germans have sex on average 6.4 times per month (that's more than once a week).

Most (66 per cent) claimed that they weren't fussy about what day of the week it was, but 18 percent admitted that Saturday was a favourite day for sex.

That doesn't mean the respondents were talking about their partners, an equal share of men and women admitted to having had at least one 
affair, with 37 percent saying they had cheated on a partner in their lifetime.

Sexpert and MailOnline blogger Tracey Cox says: 'Bathrooms offer privacy and having a bath or shower together can be super sexy. But it also works well if your partner has hygiene problems. I often suggest people have a bath or shower with their partner before sex if they're worried about body odour.

'People who are squeamish about sex often like doing it in places like the shower because it feels 'clean'.Â 

'Sadly, the most common place and time for most long-term couples in Britain is to have sex at 10.24pm on Saturday nights ... in the bedroom! Though it's not all bad: the kitchen bench is also a favourite.'
