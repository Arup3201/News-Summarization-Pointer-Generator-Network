A fashion editor has been spotted wearing a vintage coat made of real gorilla fur.

American-born, Paris-based writer Diane Pernet was photographed by the Associated Press wearing an ensemble that included the endangered species’ pelt.

In a tweet dispatched from the French capital today the news agency wrote: ‘Fashion icon Diane Pernet wears a real, vintage gorilla coat at Paris fashion week.’

Controversial skin: Fashion editor Diane Pernet has worn a gorilla fur coat for many years, which she received as a gift from a vegetarian friend (wearing it here in a photograph by Street Style Seconds)

While laws regarding the use of 
gorilla pelts vary across the world (it is banned in the UK, but not in 
the U.S.) animal rights campaign group PETA was appalled by the 
garment.

A representative 
for the organization told MailOnline: ‘Wearing a gorilla's fur is a 
relic of an age when we knew little to nothing about who these 
intelligent, family-oriented great apes are.

‘It's
 also a sickening promotion of a violent, bloody industry that still 
gasses, strangles, and electrocutes other animals for nothing more than a
 ridiculous "look."

‘Whether
 the animals were killed yesterday or decades ago, wearing their fur 
sends the damaging message that something totally unacceptable is 
somehow excusable—but it's not.’

Ms
 Pernet - a fashion film director and former French Vogue columnist - 
defended her possession of the gorilla fur coat in a 2011 entry for her 
influential blog A Shaded View on Fashion.

Long-term engagement: Ms Pernet has been wearing her coat for multiple years, and wrote about the ethics of gorilla skin in a 2011 blog post

Ms
 Pernet explained that the coat was a gift from a friend, writing: ‘I 
have not eaten red meat in decades but don't feel bad when I wear a 
vintage gorilla coat of [corset-designer] Mr. Pearl's, who, I might add,
 is a strict vegetarian and the owner of the coat.

‘The way we justify it is the gorilla has been dead for half a century and would have been dead if we wore the coat or not.’

Ms Pernet added that while she would not wear the gorilla coat if it 
weren’t vintage, she does not feel badly about purchasing new coats made
 from the pelts of animals that are not endangered.

‘I
 know I should feel bad but actually I don't. I wear leather shoes and 
that is skin without the hair, so what is the difference between wearing
 leather or wearing fur?’ [sic]

Ms
 Pernet penned the entry while visiting Copenhagen as a guest of the 
world’s largest fur auction house, admitting that she was ‘sure this 
[trip] will distress some of my readers.’.

Fan of Gorillas: Ms Pernet appears to be a fan of gorillas, posing here with a statue on her Instagram feed, and also telling AnOther magazine that an Irving Penn photo of a gorilla skull is one of her most loved things

The
 gorilla coat is a staple of Ms Pernet’s all-black wardrobe. Recent 
posts to her Instagram account reveal how she has worn it to multiple 
fashion events this winter season. Ms Pernet signature style is to veil 
her hair and wear sweeping, dark clothes in the style of a Victorian-era
 mourning ensemble.

Historically speaking, gorilla and monkey fur coats first became fashionable in the 1930s through the work of surrealist designer Elsa Schiaparelli.

According
 to Los Angeles's FIDM Museum: ‘In [1930s] advertisements and fashion 
coverage, sleek and shiny monkey fur was often described as modern, 
daring and sophisticated.’

Gorillas are remarkably close to humans in their genetic makeup, and share 98per cent of our DNA.

Three
 of the world’s four gorilla species are currently categorized as 
‘critically endangered’, and the remaining species, the ‘Western Lowland
 Gorilla’ has been labelled as ‘endangered’.

This Africa-dwelling species accounts for 100,000 of the world's approximate 104,020 gorilla population.

Gorilla fur has been barred from the market in multiple countries, the strictest of which is the UK.

Fluxing fashion: Gorilla and monkey fur was popularized in the 1930s through the work of designer Elsa Schiaparelli, but it has since become outlawed in many countries

In
 1975 the nation passed the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species, which stipulates that any gorilla fur item (as well 
as other endangered species’ pelts) acquired after 1947 requires a 
permit for use, and that trading gorilla fur (which even includes 
purchasing items through eBay and Etsy) is considered illegal.

In
 2006, a participant in the UK version of Big Brother was nearly 
arrested after telling his housemates that he had a gorilla jacket in 
tow.

Some vintage gorilla coats can still be found online for approximately $500.

It is not yet illegal to buy or sell gorilla fur products in the United States.
