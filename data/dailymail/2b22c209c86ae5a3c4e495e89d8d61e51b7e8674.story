'Unexplained death': An array of drug equipment was found near Peaches Geldof's body but Kent Police repeatedly refused to comment on what they found

Police have defended their insistence that Peaches Geldof's death was 'unexplained', despite finding overwhelming evidence of drug use around her body.

An inquest into Peaches's death earlier this week heard that police found stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home in Wrotham, Kent.

The mother of two's body was found slumped on a bed, covered in needle puncture marks. 

But for almost a month, Kent Police officers insisted that the celebrity's death was 'unexplained', with no mention of the drugs equipment they found.

They repeatedly refused to comment on whether suspicious substances or evidence had been found at her property, or even where Miss Geldof died and who was with her at the time, saying merely that officers were investigating an 'unexplained sudden death'.

It was nearly four weeks before the force finally admitted that officers 'did seize drugs paraphernalia', following a frenzy of speculation on social networking sites and media sources.

Yesterday, a spokesman for the force said they kept details of the drugs found quiet to protect Miss Geldof's family.

He said: 'We had a duty of care to Miss Geldof's family and it would be irresponsible to prematurely release details which may have led to further speculation without having established full circumstances.  The investigation included waiting for toxicology results.

Following speculation in the media, Kent Police issued a statement on 2 May with the approval of the coroner clarifying that drugs paraphernalia was found at the home address of Mrs Geldof-Cohen.'

Kent Police said the media blackout was justified because their sole duty was to the coroner, once it had been established there was no foul play.

They added: 'Although there was a significant appetite from the media for information surrounding Mrs Geldof-Cohen's death, it was important for Kent Police to carry out a thorough and professional investigation, and establish the full circumstances of the death. 

'The death was deemed non-suspicious at an early stage, when Kent Police confirmed that an investigation would be carried out on behalf of and for the Coroner. During this investigation Kent Police did not release any detail around what had or what hadn't been located. 

'It was important throughout that the integrity and professionalism of the investigation remained intact.' 

But suspicions remain that Lord Justice Leveson continues to cast a long shadow, encouraging police forces to be more secretive than ever. 

His Press standards inquiry has called for a clampdown on police/media relations, with records of meetings and tighter curbs on briefings.

But the Leveson inquiry completely ignored the value of keeping the public informed of the actions of police as they investigate often controversial events as servants of the Crown.

Double tragedy: Peaches Geldof and her mother, Paula Yates, (pictured above) both died after taking heroin

The inquest into Miss Geldofs' death earlier this week heard that police found 6.9g (0.24oz) of 'importation quality' heroin in a black cloth bag in a bedroom cupboard with a purity of 61 per cent, worth between £350 and £550.

They also discovered a syringe containing residue of heroin inside a sweet box next to the bed, and other drug paraphernalia including burnt spoons, syringes and knotted tights throughout the property.

Peaches had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood.  Her mother, Paula Yates, who died of a heroin overdose aged 41 in 2000, had 0.3mg when she died. 

North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said Miss Geldof's death had been 'drugs-related' and that heroin had played a part.

Users of social networking sites criticised Miss Geldof after details of how she died emerged, branding her 'selfish', but her sister, Fifi hit back yesterday via her Instagram account, telling detractors to 'F*** off' and 'You've no idea what you're talking about.'
