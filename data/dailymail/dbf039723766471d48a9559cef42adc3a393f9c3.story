A cat owner was left stunned after receiving a phone call to say her missing tabby had been found just 20 miles away from her home - eight years after he went missing.

Susan MacDonald, 49, was left distraught when Malcolm the cat disappeared from her home in Rockbeare, near Exeter, in Devon in 2007  - 66 years ago in cat years.

Mrs MacDonald had owned Malcom, a tabby with white patches, since he was a kitten and frantically searched the entire village for him following his disappearance.

She posted leaflets around the village but eventually gave up hope and moved away to the Greek island of Crete.

She recently moved back to the village and was left stunned after receiving a phone call last week to say Malcolm had finally been found.

He was discovered wandering the streets of Cullompton, just 20 miles away, by vet Maureen Hutchison who scanned his microchip and immediately contacted Mrs MacDonald.

Mrs MacDonald, who works with autistic adults, was reunited with her wandering pet on Saturday and said he was exactly the same as when he went missing  - but a bit fatter.

She said: 'My life has changed so much since he went missing. He was my daughter's cat but she has grown up and now lives in Iowa.

'Malcolm is quite famous over there now. I was devastated when he disappeared - he was very happy.

'I don't think he would have deliberately strayed. I feel he probably got in a car or something like that and ended up being adopted.

'But how he suddenly reappeared after eight years I don't know.

'I often used to think about him - it was the not knowing that I didn't like.' 

'I could not believe it. You never think you are going to find your animal eight years later.

She said Malcolm, now aged 11, was 'full of kisses' and a 'laid-back, loving cat'.

'He doesn't remember me, however much that hurts. He has been gone for eight years, that's about 64 years in a cat's life.

'He is just how I remember him but a little more rotund.'

Vet Mrs Hutchison, who found Malcolm, said: 'He has obviously been doing very well for himself the last eight years and is certainly well fed. 

'If cats could speak I'm sure he'd have a tale to tell.'

Pet microchips contain a unique identification number which is linked to a database containing details of the pet, as well as the owner's contact details.
