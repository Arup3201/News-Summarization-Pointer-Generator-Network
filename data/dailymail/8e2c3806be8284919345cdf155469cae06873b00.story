She one of the world’s richest sportswoman worth £60million But that hasn’t stopped Serena Williams walking off with scores of the distinctive purple and green towels provided to players at Wimbledon.

The five-times singles champion, who suffered a surprise defeat in this year’s quarter finals, takes up to eight towels with her after matches.

She is said to stuff them into her kitbag after arriving on court and then ask for more from court attendants.

Mementos: Serena Williams reportedly can't have too many Wimbledon towels

Her sister Venus, who has not played this year because of injury, is said to be similarly keen on picking up a towel in previous appearances at the All England Club.

‘The Williams sisters have been seen to put towels in their bags as soon as they get on the court,’ an observer said.

Sister Venus, who is not competing at the championships this year, is also said to be fond of the towels

‘There have been games where Serena has probably left with more than eight.’

Traditionally, players have two towels 
laid neatly on their chairs at the side of the court at the start of a 
match. Some will then ask for more.

Another couple of towels are set down whenever a tie resumes following a rain delay.

The benevolent All England Club has a policy of not demanding towels back from any players who want to keep them.

However, some players - notably world number one Novak Djokovic - always hand back their towels at the end of every clash.

For a visitor to the grounds, a large towel emblazoned with the Wimbledon logo, costs £28 at shops at the grounds.

Rising British star Laura Robson, 19, she took a generous approach, leaving two children speechless with delight as she handed them her towel as she left court after her third round win.

At the end of Andy Murray’s quarter final clash on Wednesday he threw his towel into the crowd, prompting a near scuffle between two fans who both grabbed an end of it.

This year observers have noticed growing trend for players to ask for a towel to mop their brows between points In the ladies quarter-finals, the worst offender was Na Li, who stopped 16 times in one set, and 35 during the entire match, which she lost.

One of Andy Murray’s former coaches suggested that ‘towel breaks’ are a ploy to buy time.

Former British player Mark Petchey, who 
coached Murray into the top 50 of the world rankings, said: ‘It is 
certainly not that hot at a lot of these tournaments - it hasn’t been at
 London or Paris for the last two Grand Slams.

‘It’s part of players’ routine, like bouncing the ball three times. It’s all a bit of a nervous tic. All players look for their comfort zone. A lot of it is all about composing yourself.’

He suggested that former British number one Greg Rusedski had started the trend.

A spokesman for Wimbledon said: ‘The players are requested to give the towels back but can keep them if they want to.’
