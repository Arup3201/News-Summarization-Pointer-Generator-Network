An aspiring model has been scarred for life by a dentist’s drill that overheated and burned through her lip.

Jade Blinco, 24, says she now looks ‘like a monster’ after the hospital operation to remove two wisdom teeth went horribly wrong.

NHS bosses have admitted the injury could have been prevented and are negotiating an out-of-court settlement.

Jade Blinco, 24, from Bilston in the West Midlands, was left permanently scarred when a dentist's drill overheated and melted her lip

The 24-year-old, pictured before the incident, had her wisdom teeth removed at Birmingham City Hospital. She said: 'I've always had a fear of dentists. But I never expected something like this could happen'

Yesterday Miss Blinco, from Bilston, West Midlands, said: ‘The last three years have been horrendous as I have tried to come to terms with living with the horrific injury and scar I have been left with.

‘I’ve always had a fear of dentists. I was scared of needles and sitting in the dentist’s chair. But I never expected something like this.’ 

Describing what happened at Birmingham City Hospital on September 1, 2011, she said: ‘The dentist explained what was going to happen and gave me a contract to read through and sign before the procedure.

‘They were putting me under general anaesthetic so he mentioned that. As soon as I woke up I felt excruciating pain.

‘No one told me what had happened, they gave me two doses of morphine and sent me back to sleep. No one noticed in the operating theatre. I never imagined for one minute that I would wake from surgery to be told I had a serious painful burn that has scarred me for life.

‘I just felt ugly, being a model I took a lot of pictures of myself and took care over my appearance, and suddenly I looked a monster.

‘I’ve been told I may need plastic surgery to try and improve the appearance of my lip but it’s likely I will never look the same as before.’ 

Miss Blinco quit her job as a nursery worker because her scar was scaring the children.

Miss Blinco said the scar, which she calls 'disgusting', changes throughout the year and often peels

She said: ‘When I went back to the nursery to hand in my sick note, the kids were horrified by what had happened to me.

‘They looked really distressed and scared. I walked out in tears and knew then, for definite, that I couldn’t go back.

‘And no modelling agencies will take me any more with this scar.’

Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust has admitted full liability and Miss Blinco is in line for a payout.

A spokesman for the NHS Trust said: ‘We are very sorry for the distress experienced by Miss Blinco. 

'We apologised immediately after the incident in person and subsequently in writing to her. 

'On the day of surgery an apology was given to Miss Blinco by the senior surgeon which was reiterated the following day in the presence of family members.

'Our chief executive has also written to apologise to Miss Blinco earlier this year.

'Since the incident we have changed all of our hand pieces ensuring that this issue will not occur again.’ 

Charlotte Cook, a medical expert for solicitors Irwin Mitchell who represented her, said: 'Jade suffered a serious injury that has left her permanently scarred and has had a huge impact on her life and future.

'One of the most concerning elements of what happened is that the Trust's investigation highlighted that it was aware the drill tool was prone to overheating after a previous instance of a patient suffering a lip burn.

'Jade's injuries were totally unnecessary and could easily have been prevented.'
