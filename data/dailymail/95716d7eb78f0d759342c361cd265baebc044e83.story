It's the accolade no one wants to be associated with.

Sorry, residents of Hemel Hempstead, your town has been named the ugliest in the UK.

The Hertfordshire town beat Luton into second place and Slough into third to top a poll which also ranked Bracknell and Birmingham highly – or lowly, rather.

Hemel Hempstead has been voted the 'ugliest town' in Britain. Pictured in the 'Magic Roundabout' in the town

The town came out top with 785 out of more than 3,000 votes cast in the poll on Crap Towns Returns. Pictured is an amusement centre in Hemel Hempstead

Camberley in Surrey came sixth 
followed by Coventry in the West Midlands and Cumbernauld  in North 
Lanarkshire, which was created in the 1950s to accommodate Glasgow’s 
surplus population.

Hatfield, another Hertfordshire eyesore, ranked ninth and Gateshead in Tyne and Wear came in at number ten.

Author Sam Jordison, who organised 
the survey, said: ‘I know exactly why Hemel did so well in the poll. 
I’ve been there once. And once was more than enough.

One of the authors of the survey said he knew 'exactly why Hemel did so well in the poll'. Pictured is the Post Office headquarters in Hemel Hempstead

Hemel Hempstead is famous for its 'Magic Roundabout', an interchange where traffic from six routes meet

Hemel Hempstead was designated as the site of one of the Government's proposed New Towns following the Second World War

2. Luton

3. Slough

4. Bracknell

5. Birmingham

6. Camberley

7. Coventry

8. Cumbernauld

9. Hatfield

10. Gateshead

‘Although I am surprised that 
Coventry didn’t do better, or worse, following the number of people 
writing in to say it looked better just after it was bombed than it does
now.’

The 100 winners of the survey by website C*** Towns will now be whittled down to 50 for a book entitled C*** Town Returns.

Its predecessor, published in 2003, 
sold more than 100,000 copies and provoked outrage, including from 
former Conservative leader Michael Howard, whose constituency of Hythe 
in Kent was included at number four.

The full 2003 list also 
controversially included Chipping Norton, the rural Oxfordshire town 
associated with members of ‘the Chipping Norton Set’ such as David 
Cameron, Jeremy Clarkson and Rebekah Brooks.

The second book is ‘back by unpopular demand’, according to the publishers, and is scheduled for release in October.

Not satisfied with declaring which is the ugliest town, the website now has a poll of the dullest towns in the UK.

There include Banbury, Boston, Bury St Edmunds, Burnham Market, Camberley, Chipping Norton,
Fort William, Hatfield, Leamington Spa, Maidenhead, Rhyl and Thetford.
