Britain stormed to yet another cycling gold yesterday – as the forlorn French said Team GB’s riders are hiding their ‘magic wheels’ after the races.

Jason Kenny, 24, powered to victory over Frenchman Gregory Bauge in the men’s sprint in front of 6,000 baying fans.

It was Britain’s fifth track cycling gold out of seven events. There are hopes of three more today with Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott all expected to win medals.

But yesterday the French team’s 
dejected director, Isabelle Gautheron, complained that the British stars
are using ‘magic wheels’.

‘We are asking a lot of questions: how have they gained so many tenths of seconds?’ she said.

‘Have they found a new training 
process based on certain energy pathways? I am not talking about any 
illicit product, because anti-doping tests are so strong.

‘We are looking a lot at the kit they
use. They hide their wheels a lot. The ones for the bikes they race on 
are put in wheel covers at the finish.’

Last night Britain’s bemused cycling 
performance director Dave Brailsford said: ‘It’s interesting that people
are starting to ask questions.

'It’s no different from when we raced the last three-and-a-half weeks at the Tour de France.

'It’s the same method, the same philosophy and essentially fantastic coaching which is the only secret weapon we possess.

‘As far as the Olympic Games go, only two weeks are important – one week in Beijing, one week here. And we’ve peaked for both.’

Last week French President Francois 
Hollande taunted Britain for its lack of early gold medal success. But 
Team GB is now well clear of France in the medals table.

Bolton-born Kenny was picked ahead of
Olympic legend Sir Chris Hoy, but emphatically beat seven-time world 
champion Bauge, the favourite for the title, to take the gold.

It was Kenny’s second of the Games 
and adds to the one he won in Beijing. He is already being tipped for 
more medals at Rio in 2016.

‘It’s amazing,’ he admitted, ‘I hadn’t even thought about it until we got on to that last ride and it suddenly dawned on me.

‘The battle I had just to get here 
with Chris [Hoy] – I thought I’d better not mess this one up. Now I am 
really pleased to deliver for the team.’

‘It dawned on me that if Chris had 
been in my shoes there was no way he would have lost. It is a shame that
we could not have two of us in here.

‘He has that real killer instinct 
which is why he has so many medals.

'And my final ride was not that 
amazing if I am honest. I just let the crowd carry me home.’

Hoy beat Kenny in the 2008 final but after a rule change only one of them could represent Britain in London.

Within moments of Kenny’s victory, Hoy
tweeted: ‘That was PHENOMENAL by Jason Kenny. So happy and proud of 
him, well deserved mate.’

Team GB's cycling kit has been the subject of allegation by the director of the rival French team

Somewhat ironically, the manufacturer of Team GB's wheels is a French company, which also supplies the Australian and French national teams.

And the company concerned, Mavic, has said all of the teams it supplies have exactly the same wheels.

But this still hasn't stopped the director of the French cycling team from suggesting that Team GB's wheels are somehow 'magic'.

'Do they really have Mavic wheels?' Isabelle Gautheron has asked.

An apparent partnership with McLaren might well be the source of the French director's ire.

When asked about the exact specifications of the British cycling team's kit, Matt Parker, who is in charge of developing the technology used by the team, has said only that the kit is top of the range.

'We make sure the riders have the very best equipment available to them,' he told French newspaper L'Equipe who asked about the allegations.

Chris Boardman, head of British Cycling's research and development group known as the Secret Squirrel Club, has laughed off the claims of magic wheels, however.

He said: 'It makes me smile. We used those wheels in Athens.

'It's the least technologically advanced piece of equipment that there is. It hasn't changed since '96 when Mavic introduced the five-spoke wheel, it's still the standard now.'

Boardman declined to reveal the gains made by technology, but was at a loss to explain why rival nations are not following Britain's lead by doing research in wind tunnels.

'I could quantify it, but I'm not going to,' Boardman said.

'All of the riders have been in a wind tunnel...they're the biggest lump, so they've invested a lot of time sitting (there).

'Chris Hoy's done eight-hour days sitting in a wind tunnel, helping us develop things and improving his own position.'

'The rest of the world has known since Beijing - well, they should've known forever - aerodynamics is a massive part of our sport,' he said.
