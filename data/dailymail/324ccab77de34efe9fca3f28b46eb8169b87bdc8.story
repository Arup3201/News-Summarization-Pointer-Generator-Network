A father and his two sons landed behind bars on drunken driving charges in connection to a single car accident in Vermont over the weekend.

Nicholas Woodward, 19, his 22-year-old brother, Joshua, and their father, 46-year-old Brian Woodward, all from Fairfax, were arrested Saturday in Fletcher on their way home from a fishing trip.

For the youngest of the Woodward trio, the arrest marked the second DUI incident in as many weeks. His older brother, Joshua Woodward, is also facing a count of driving on a suspended license.

All in the family: Joshua Woodward, 22 (left), his 19-year-old brother Nicholas (right), and their father Brian Woodward have been charged with DUI in Vermont in connection to a one-car rollover crash 

According to police in Vermont, it all started just before 8pm Saturday when a warden with the Vermont Fish and Wildlife came upon an overturned vehicle on Cambridge Road.

Officers who arrived on the scene determined that Joshua Woodward was behind the wheel at the time of the rollover, and that his blood alcohol level was nearly three times the state’s legal limit.

As the 22-year-old was being evaluated by paramedics on the scene, police said his 19-year-old brother, Nicholas, pulled over at the site of the wreck in his own vehicle to check up on his sibling.

Repeat offense: The 19-year-old Nicholas Woodward was cited for another DUI incident two week before the rollover

Brian Woodward, who was a passenger in Nicholas' truck, then got behind the wheel to move the vehicle closer to Joshua's wreckage. 

The Fish and Wildlife game warden, who was still at the scene, noticed that Brian Woodward appeared inebriated and ordered him to stop the truck and get out, according to police.

State troopers noted that the 46-year-old man reeked of alcohol and appeared impaired. A breath test confirmed that Mr Woodward also had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit.

While the father of two was being handcuffed, troopers noticed that Nicholas Woodward, who is underage, also appeared to have been drinking alcohol that night.

Field sobriety tests and the teen’s preliminary breath sample confirmed that he was driving under the influence, police said.

The teen was cited for DUI - his second in two weeks. He is due back in court August 18, while his brother and father are set to appear before a judge September 2.
