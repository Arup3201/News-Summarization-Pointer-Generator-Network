Fugitive spy Edward Snowden dramatically fled Hong Kong yesterday accompanied by an ex-girlfriend of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

The former CIA technician flew to Russia hours after the White House warned Hong Kong not to drag its feet over his extradition.

Last night he slept in a hotel at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. He is expected to fly to Cuba today for a connecting flight to South America.

Searching for asylum: Edward Snowden is travelling to Ecuador after being charged with espionage in America. He met with Ecuador's ambassador as he landed in Moscow today 

His final destination is now known to be Ecuador after its foreign minister Ricardo Patino Aroca confirmed Snowden had applied there for asylum.

Assange, 41, has himself been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for more than a year to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex charges.

Snowden, 30, was accompanied on his flight to Moscow by British activist, Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks spokesman and former girlfriend of Assange.

They travelled business class on Aeroflot flight SU213 and were met by officials from Ecuador including its ambassador to Moscow Patricio Chavez.

He told reporters at the airport: 
‘We’re waiting for Sarah. We’re going to talk to them.’ Miss Harrison, 
who has also worked for the discredited Bureau of Investigative 
Journalism, was praised by WikiLeaks last night for ‘courageously’ 
assisting Snowden.

The City University graduate went to work for WikiLeaks several years ago and soon became known as the gatekeeper to Assange.

It was once claimed she did everything for him, ranging from organising his diary to washing his socks.

Last
 year Miss Harrison was forced to pay £3,500 to the courts after she had
 put up £5,000 as one of the people who provided sureties for Mr 
Assange’s bail conditions.

A
 WikiLeaks statement said yesterday: ‘Miss Harrison has courageously 
assisted Mr Snowden with his lawful departure from Hong Kong and is 
accompanying Mr Snowden on his passage to safety.’ 

Snowden
 has been charged with espionage after exposing Prism – a covert project
 run by US intelligence that snoops on Facebook accounts, emails and 
phone calls.

He has also 
detailed a massive electronic eavesdropping operation by Britain’s GCHQ 
called Operation Tempora. Snowden described it as ‘the largest programme
 of suspicionless surveillance in human history’.

The US had made a formal request to the Hong Kong government for a provisional arrest warrant to stop him leaving the territory.

But relations cooled after Snowden claimed the US had hacked into Chinese mobile phone companies to access millions of text messages. Beijing said it was ‘gravely concerned’ about the allegations.

In a statement yesterday, the Hong Kong government said Snowden boarded a plane at Chep Lap Kok airport ‘on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel’. 

It said documentation provided by America for the arrest warrant did not ‘fully comply’ with Hong Kong law.

Clearly irritated, the Hong Kong government also demanded ‘clarification’ on hacking saying it would ‘follow up on the matter’ to protect the legal rights of its citizens.

In the US, security chiefs were 
bewildered at how Snowden had been allowed to leave the Chinese- run 
territory because his passport had been revoked on Saturday.Keith 
Alexander, head of the US National Security Agency said: ‘This is an 
individual who is not acting, in my opinion, with noble intent.

‘What Snowden has revealed has caused irreversible and significant damage to our country and to our allies.’ 

Democratic senator Charles Schumer believes Russian President Vladimir Putin approved Snowden’s flight to Moscow.

He said: ‘Putin always seems almost 
eager to stick a finger in the eye of the United States – whether it is 
Syria, Iran and now of course with Snowden.’ 

He also suggested China may have had a role to play in Snowden’s departure from Hong Kong.He added: ‘It remains to be seen how much influence Beijing had on Hong Kong.

Spokeswoman: Miss Harrison became close to Assange when she started working at WikiLeaks and is believed to have acted as his assistant

‘As you know, they coordinate their foreign policies and I have a feeling that the hand of Beijing was involved here.’ 

Former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, legal director of WikiLeaks and lawyer for Julian Assange, said: ‘The WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr Snowden’s rights and protecting him as a person.

‘What is being done to Mr Snowden and to Mr Julian Assange – for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest – is an assault against the people.’

Safe haven: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden over rape allegations

It would be ironic if whistleblower Snowden makes Ecuador his home given their poor human rights record in the past.

President Rafael Correa has been accused of repeatedly using his country’s defamation laws to restrict freedom of speech.

Human Rights Watch also said Ecuador has used ‘terrorism and sabotage’ laws to prosecute cases involving protesters against mining and oil projects and insisted cases of police brutality go unpunished.

Revelations by Snowden  published in The Guardian ‘probably breached’ the Official Secrets Act, security experts say.

The paper did not seek the advice of the Defence Advisory Committee before publishing stories considered potentially dangerous to national security.

A source close to the body, known as the D-Notice committee, said: ‘The stories were also probably a breach of the Official Secrets Act.’

The reports revealed how GCHQ spied on diplomats at the G20 conference in 2009 and also its massive tapping operation on fibre optic cables carrying data to Europe.
