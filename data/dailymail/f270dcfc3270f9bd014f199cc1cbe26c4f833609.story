Most girlfriends receive perfume or jewellery for Christmas.

However, Suzanne Davies was given something a little more personal – her boyfriend's kidney.

Devoted Neil Parry saved his partner's life by donating his organ to the 36-year-old, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, after discovering he was a million-to-one match.

Suzanne underwent the lifesaving kidney transplant in the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, in December after her partner of 10 years proved a near-perfect match.

The mother to two children was told she was in renal failure by doctors and either needed to go on dialysis or have her kidney replaced.

Despite finding it a daunting prospect, businessman Neil stepped up to help the love of his life.

'He is my hero and my saviour,' Suzanne said.

'I'm so lucky to have him in my life. For the last 10 years we have been together he has seen me suffer with my health. He could have walked away but he didn't.

'He has stuck with me through thick and thin and now he has given me a new lease of life. I can't thank him enough.'

Suzanne has suffered with a rare disorder of the adrenal glands, called Addison's disease, since she was just eight years old.

She has needed regular medication for nearly three decades to replace two essential hormones she lacks in her body called cortisol and aldosterone. 

'My hero': Suzanne says she has a new lease of life after her partner Neil donated his kidney to her

But her health took a turn for the worse two years ago when her kidney function began to deteriorate. 

She said: 'I was being sick quite a lot and for the past 18 months I've been suffering with gout and getting lots of infections.

'When I went to see a consultant in September and he said I either needed a transplant or dialysis.

'Both my mum and Neil were a match but it was best to go with Neil as he's younger and more healthy. It was a big step for him.'

Addison's disease is a condition in which the body does not make enough of the hormone cortisol.

When the body's cortisol levels drop too low, this can cause a range of symptoms.

These include weakness, dizziness, fatigue and abdominal pain.

A very low cortisol level can be life-threatening.

This is because cortisol is vital as it helps regulate blood pressure and the immune system and it helps the body respond to stress.

Addison's disease is treated with hormone replacement tablets.

It is thought about 8,000 people in the UK have the illness and most cases first develop in people aged between 30 and 50.

About 70 per cent of cases are thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease but it can also be triggered by TB.

The pair met 10 years ago on a night out in Swansea and have been inseparable ever since.

They have two children together, nine-year-old Cole and five-year-old Isla, and also lost a daughter at just a day old in 2008.

Suzanne said: 'Neil is my best friend and we've been through so much together.

'He has changed my life for the better so our two beautiful children can have a healthy mum.

'We might get married at some stage, but I don't need a piece of paper to prove how much we belong together.

'I'd rather hand over all the wedding money to charity.'

Suzanne, who is still in hospital after she suffered a minor infection in her ureteric stent following the transplant on December 8, said she now has plans to study to become a nurse or criminologist.

'I've never been healthy in my life, so for him to give me this chance is amazing,' she said.

Neil said the entire family managed to spend Christmas Day at their Merthyr home.

He said: 'If she'd gone on dialysis she'd need three visits a week to the hospital - and people on dialysis get very poorly.

'Having the operation meant we were both out of action for a just couple of months, rather than anything long-term. We are a strong couple.'

The chances of receiving a good match from a non-related living donor, such as a friend or spouse, are around one in a million. 

Professor Neil Turner, ex-Chairman of Kidney Research UK, said: 'For kidney patients in need of a transplant, there’s a strong chance that their parents or children will be a good match, because they are directly related. And one in four siblings may be a near-perfect match.

'However, the chances of receiving a perfect match from a non-related living donor, such as a friend or spouse, are around one in a million.

'With 5,500 people in the UK currently awaiting a kidney transplant, we really need more people to join the organ donor register.

'We also need more research aimed at improving the lifespan of transplanted kidneys. This has got much better, but on average they last a bit less than 15 years before needing to be replaced.'
