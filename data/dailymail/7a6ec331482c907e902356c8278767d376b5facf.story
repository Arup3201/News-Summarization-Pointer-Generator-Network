'Groper': Harris touched the breast and behind of a 15-year-old girl at an Australian shop in 1991, Southwark Crown Court heard

Rolf Harris groped a 15-year-old girl's breast after telling her to give him a hug, before rubbing his groin against her mother's behind, a court heard.

Harris, 84, approached the girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - at an event in an Australian shop in 1991, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The teenager later told her mother what happened - and described Harris as a 'dirty old man' - but did not take the complaint further for fear of making a fuss.

Speaking to the court via video-link, the woman said: 'He put his right hand on my left breast and through my shirt. I had a shirt that was gathered and did not have buttons on the front.

'He put his other hand on my right butt cheek. His hand was over my bra but through my shirt.

'It was very deliberate. I stepped back and he laughed'.

She recalled pulling away from him and then making her way back in to the crowd.

Now a mother-of-five, the woman told the court: 'I was in shock and I stayed away from him'.

The court also heard evidence from her mother, who said Harris rubbed his groin against her while a photograph was being taken. She said she called him a 'disgusting creature', which made him 'sneer' at her.

Harris stands accused of 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986, and denies all charges. The alleged assaults in Australia are not part of the charges for which he is being tried. The women were speaking to give evidence of Harris's bad character.

The woman's mother said that when she asked her daughter what was wrong she did not explain fully and would only say that Harris was 'very handy'.

There were around 20 people in the store at the time of the alleged attack. Harris was drawing cartoons and greeting people when the two women arrived.

The teenager was asked if she wanted to do a drawing with Harris but she refused and did not want to go near him, she said.

She rejected a suggestion by Sonia Woodley QC, defending, that she had decided to 'jump on the bandwagon' by making the assault claims.

When Ms Woodley suggested Harris had not indecently touched her, she replied: 'He did. I was a very naive young lady. It was extremely unacceptable'.

Her mother also claimed that Harris sexually assaulted her on the same day, saying she felt him rubbing his groin against her buttocks as he stood behind her while posing for a photograph.

The 
mother, also via videolink, said: 'He was very close to me. He was close
 enough to be rubbing himself up against my buttocks. I do not consider 
that it happened to me, it was something that was done to me'.

She responded by deliberately treading on his foot, she claimed, and turned around and said: 'You are a disgusting creature'.

The mother told the court that Harris’s expression switched from being 'smiling and friendly' to an 'almost sneer'.

She said: 'I had challenged him in some way. He was almost acting in disbelief. He was close to me, right into my face, and he said, "she likes it."'

The mother said she knew he was talking about her daughter. She claimed Harris seemed to 'home in' on her daughter when he arrived at the store. He asked her if she wanted to help him with some drawings.

The mother told the court: 'He was in close proximity to her and suddenly she pulled away from him. She seemed to be taken aback by something. Initially she moved away from him.

'I asked her what was wrong. She said, "mum, he is very handy." It all happened so quickly'.

Ms Woodley
 suggested that Harris did not touch her while the photograph was being 
taken and that he did not say that her daughter 'liked it'.

In
 response the mother told the court: 'Rolf Harris is a dirty old man who
 certainly did say that. I have had to bear the burden of putting my 
daughter in that position. It is certainly something I did not make up'.

Asked
 about why she did not act on her daughter’s allegations earlier, the 
mother said: 'I thought about telling the police however my innocent 15 
year-old daughter insisted not to do it. She did not want much fuss'.

Earlier, the mother of an aspiring teenage theatre star who claimed she developed an eating disorder after allegedly being groped by Harris as a 15-year-old said her daughter has 'never been the same'.

Tonya Lee, now 43, who has waived the right to anonymity given to alleged sex offence victims, said Harris touched her when she travelled to Britain from Australia for a tour in 1986.

Her mother, Jean Mulgrew, told the jury that she was not the same when she returned home and she became anorexic and also suffered from bulimia.

Speaking by video-link, she told the court: 'I do not remember much but I remember one thing and that is Tonya’s life changed and it was for the worse.

'It was when she came back from overseas and she has never been the same since'.

After being cross-examined by defence lawyers, Ms Lee admitted she had weight issues before the date of the alleged assault, which she had given a wrong date for.

But she insisted that Harris was still to blame for eating disorders after the time she met Harris.

As evidence was given, Harris  listened intently evidence and occasionally took sips of water.

Smartly dressed in a blue suit, white 
shirt and patterned tie, he arrived at court accompanied by his wife, sculptor and jeweller Alwen Hughes and other family members.

The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.
