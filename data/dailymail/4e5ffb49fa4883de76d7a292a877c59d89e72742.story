Carl Froch hailed BBC gymnastics TV show Tumble for improving his flexibility and strength. 

The current IBF and WBA Super middleweight world champion has seen his odds slashed to win the show with his continued impressive performances.

He told the Nottingham Post: 'It's definitely benefited my range of movement and my core strength – it's stronger than it's ever been – it's key to any physical exercise.

'I've enjoyed training. There's a lot of strength work – boxing made the training hard because it uses a different set of muscle groups.'

Strong balance: Froch points towards success as he gets the fourth highest score out of all the contestants

Champion display: Alex Jones speaks to Carl Froch about his gymnastics display

Froch's display earned him 26 points, putting him fourth out of the ten contestants. 

He added: 'It was not as bad as it looked – when I first got on it was painful but your body hardens to it. Your hands get calloused, your nerves start to get tougher.' 

'There's a couple of moves I am feeling 50/50 about but I'm going to do the full routine – I like the fear factor of it all.'
