An ex-business partner of Wolf of Wall Street's Jordan Belfort is suing Martin Scorsese and Paramount for $25 million over his drug-taking portrayal in the blockbuster.

Andrew Greene, head of corporate finance at Stratton Oakmont worked alongside Belfort during the 1990s before the firm collapsed.

Although he is not named in the film, in the federal lawsuit he claims the movie is defamatory portraying him as a criminal and a drug user as well as mocking his premature hair loss.

Greene, who is portrayed through the character Nicky 'Rugrat' Koskoff, says that in real-life his co-workers called him 'Wigman' due to his toupee

He also says the filmmakers never got his permission to use his name, likeness or identity.

character Nicky 'Rugrat' Koskoff - played by P.J. Byrne -  says that in 
real-life his co-workers called him 'Wigman' due to his toupee. 

In the film Greene is seen shaving the head of an employee, who, in exchange, will be rewarded with $10,000 to be spent on breast implants as well as having sex with an employee in the office.

According to the suit seen by TMZ Greene claims the characterization has damaged his professional reputation as an investment banker.

He has lodged a claim for $25 million in damages from Paramount and Scorsese's production company.

Jordan Belfort set up the brokerage house Stratton Oakmont alongside Danny Porush. 

The 'boiler room' firm 
based on Long Island designed to 'pump and dump' shares by hyping their 
prospects and quickly cashing in once their price rose.

The pair managed to rake in $200million from the fraud, which they spent on cocaine, prostitutes and a yacht once owned by Coco Chanel.

However, after the FBI caught up with them in 1996, Belfort spent 22 months in prison while Porush was sentenced to 39 months.

Hard sell: Johna Hill plays Danny Porush in the 
real-life Wolf of Wall Street about the infamous pump and dump scam. 
Porush was Jordan Belfort's (Leonardo DiCaprio) partner - he also threatened to sue

Belfort, 50, has written a pair of memoirs detailing his past misdeeds, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2008 and 2009's Catching the Wolf of Wall Street.

Last month Porush also claimed his portrayal was not realistic and that Belfort fantasized about many of their antics.

He
 wants to set the record straight and is adamant that he didn't engage 
in a threesome with Belfort, neither did he expose himself in public nor 
did he take illegal drugs.

'The character 
in the movie is not me. I had nothing to do with the film and I don't 
live in the past. It's not me, and anyone that knows me will know that I
 never did any of those things.

'It comes from the imagination of Hollywood writers and is based on several characters, not just me.

'I
 made no money from the movie. I have never tried to profit from a crime
 I am remorseful for, and I didn't try to profit from the movie.

'There is no character which 
accurately depicts me. I've seen the film, and like you, I didn't know 
what was going to happen next. It's a complete work of fiction. We can 
all have a good laugh at it at the movie, but we are all glad it is 
over.

'If you cannot laugh 
at yourself, then what can you do. But that character was not me, nor my
 persona and everyone knows it wasn't.'

Such was Porush's unhappiness at the film that he threatened to sue over it. Because of that, Hill's name is Danny Azoff in the film. Producers changed the name after Porush threatened to sue.

The character has earned talented Hill an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.
