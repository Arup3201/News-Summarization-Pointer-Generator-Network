The director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System received an $8,500 performance bonus in April while the agency's inspector general investigated the deaths of 40 veterans there due to mismanaged waiting lists.

Sharon Helman also got a $9,345 bonus in 2013. A red-faced VA was forced to rescind the bonuses on Wednesday after a member of Congress blew the whistle on national television.

As the scandal deepens, two Democrats have broken a partisan logjam by demanding the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki.

Rep. David Scott, a George Democrat, blasted the VA secretary Wednesday on the House floor and demanded his ouster

Gen. Eric Shinseki, the embattled VA secretary, is under intense fire from both sides of the political aisle, but President Barack Obama is defending him -- at least for now

Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller blasted the VA during an interview Wednesday afternoon on CNN, saying that Helman 'received an $8,500 bonus last month while there was an open IG investigation into Phoenix.'

'And they are trying to say that it was a low-level person [who] made an administrative error. ... This has got to stop,' he insisted.

The VA said hours later that 'Secretary Shinseki today exercised his authority to rescind Sharon Helman’s fiscal year 2013 performance award immediately. Previously, Ms. Helman received the performance award due to an administrative error.'

Her annual salary, not including bonuses, is $169,900.

As the crisis gathers steam inside the Obama administration, two House Democrats have joined a chorus of Republicans in demanding Shinseki's resignation.

Georgia Rep. John Barrow – who faces a tough re-election battle this year in a district where Republican voters outnumber Democrats – slammed the White House for having 'fallen short in providing the kind of care that our veterans have earned.'

'While I don't think a change in leadership will immediately solve the serious problems that plague the VA,' Barrow said shortly after President Barack Obama addressed the VA scandal in a press conference, 'I do think it's time to give someone else an opportunity to lead the agency and begin the rebuilding process to ensure these issues never happen again.'

'Secretary Shinseki deserves the utmost respect for his service,' he added, 'but it's time for someone new to get to the bottom of what's happened on his watch.'

An angry John Boehner said he's getting perilously close to demanding Shinseki's resignation

Obama said Wednesday after he met with Shinseki and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors that he would reserve judgment on the VA secretary's future until an inspector general report hit his desk

Obama assured Americans that 'if these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it.'

He has been reluctant to sack Shinseki, even after VA Undersecretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel resigned on May 16, insisting that the inspector general report – due weeks from now – would guide his actions.

Meanwhile, Georgia Democratic Rep. David Scott said Wednesday on the House floor that 'the first person we need to fire is the secretary of Veterans Affairs.'

'We respect him, we respect his sacrifice for his country and everything else, but the buck stops at the top.'

Scott doubled down with a rare rebuke of Obama. 'I was very disappointed with President Obama today.,' he said. 'There was no urgency. Mr. President, we need urgency.'

'We need you to roll up your sleeves and get into these hospitals!'

During his weekly press briefing, a booming-voiced House Speaker John Boehner nearly yelled his support for veterans.

'We've not just let them down, we've let them die, and somebody ought to be held accountable for it!' he said.
