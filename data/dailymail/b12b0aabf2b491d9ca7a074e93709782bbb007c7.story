When a cherished religious icon went missing from Chester Cathedral, police spent a month trawling CCTV footage to catch the culprit.

And officers were astonished when their investigation led them not only to the painting but a haul of other artworks – all behind the door of a terraced house.

More than 30 paintings, mostly depicting Jesus, were discovered on the wall of one room alone, crammed into the property alongside scores of crucifixes and busts.

Officers are now trying to find out how many of them were stolen.

Police discovered the large stash of religious icons inside a family home in Crewe after the unusual theft 

They were looking for The Raising of Lazarus, which stood on the altar in the cathedral’s chapel of St Anselm until it was stolen last month.

Painted on a wooden board, the icon, which is around 8in by 12in, was donated to the cathedral seven years ago by the family of the former dean of Chester, Ingram Cleasby.

The chapel had been roped off but was recently opened up to the public with the altar guarded only by a 17th century rail. The painting was snatched some time between August 15 and 18 and a plastic Christmas angel was put in its place. Officers have spent the past month scouring CCTV from Chester city centre to try to trace the culprits.

Yesterday Chief Superintendent Andy Southcott, of Cheshire constabulary, said the haul was found following old-fashioned policing.

‘While the number of heritage crimes committed in Cheshire is very low, it can have a high impact on the community,’ Mr Southcott said.

‘It can deprive people from viewing important paintings and also means they are lost to future generations. It is something Cheshire police take very seriously.’

Chris Jones, head constable at the cathedral, said: ‘The piece was an important addition to the chapel of St Anselm and helped to enhance the experience of our visitors and our worshippers.

‘We would like to thank the Cheshire Constabulary team for all their hard work on the case and for their ongoing support in the fight against heritage crime.’

Four men and a woman, aged between 31 and 59, were arrested at the terraced house in Crewe on suspicion of theft.
