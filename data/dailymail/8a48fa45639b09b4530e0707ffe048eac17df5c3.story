Britain is now the largest donor to an international fund to help poor countries, putting in £2.8billion - more than the US, Japan and Germany.

The fund run by the World Bank raised nearly £32billion at a meeting of governments in Moscow last week, with the UK giving around 10 per cent of that.

Ministers also offered up an additional £500million in low-interest loans to the International Development Association, which raises money from richer countries, with 46 donating, to the world’s 82 poorest nations for health, education and economic projects.

Pledge: The contribution is part of David Cameron's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid

The money is part of David Cameron’s controversial pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid, which Britain will fulfil next year after vast increases in spending by the Department for International Development (DFID).

It comes as other departments have had their budgets cut back. In March, George Osborne said the aid budget would hit £11.2billion this year - more than the Home Office budget.

The aid target was a key plank of Mr Cameron’s strategy to ‘decontaminate’ the Tories’ uncaring image at the last election, but he has come under pressure to drop it in the wake of the financial crisis.

Right-wing Tories such as Peter Bone have attacked increases in the aid budget pegged to economic growth as ‘absurd’.

He said earlier this month: ‘The aid budget is going to go up, not because there is more need for it or more poverty in the world, but because we have got better economic growth – it is a nonsense. This is why these arbitrary targets are such a mistake.

‘We are still borrowing billions a month but, because growth has gone up, we are going to borrow even more so that we can give it away.’

As a top contributor, the UK will get added influence over the policies it funds and how the cash is spent, according to the World Bank. Britain was also the top donor to this fund during in 2007 and was in the top four donors in 2010.

The latest aid package was negotiated by government officials, who offered a contribution even larger than that of the United States, the next biggest donor which put in £2.4billion - although the U.S. Treasury said Washington would seek to increase its contribution when next year’s federal budget is finalised.

Japan, which was third, would not provide specific figures, while Germany which was in fourth place pledged £1billion in grants, conditional on the approval of its parliament.

A DFID spokesperson said: ‘The UK has secured important reforms to the way the World Bank delivers aid, including greater emphasis on improving value for money, and increased focus on conflict countries.

‘Thanks to this investment 200 million children will receive life-saving vaccines, it will also provide health services for 65 million people and access to clean water for 32 million people.’
