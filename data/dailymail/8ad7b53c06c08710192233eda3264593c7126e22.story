A mother-of two has endured feeling permanently seasick since spending a few days on a friend's boat two years ago.

Claire Farrow decided to live on a house boat with her architect husband Ian Hogarth and their two children while they built their dream home in Kensington, London.

But after just a few days of staying on the boat in Chelsea, Ms Farrow was left feeling dizzy, struggling to balance and vomiting up to five times a day.

The 44-year-old company director, said the symptoms started when a water taxi raced passed and shook the boat violently while she was asleep.

She said she felt like she was rocking from side to side all day, but took some seasickness tablets and hoped the symptoms would pass.

But Ms Farrow was horrified when even after moving off the boat within days she still felt seasick - with symptoms so severe she struggled to walk down the road.

With constant dizziness and sickness 
and finding it increasingly difficult to work, Ms Farrow went to see a 
specialist who diagnosed her with the rare condition, Mal de 
Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS).

There is no known cure for the condition, and Ms Farrow still suffers from symptoms over two years later.

She
said: 'Having spent years designing other people’s dream homes and 15 
years looking for a site, Ian and I had found a suitable piece of land 
in London on which to build a house.

'We sold our flat to fund the build and with our two children moved onto a house boat, kindly lent to us by a friend.

'We moved on the Friday, and I was fine until the Monday morning when a river taxi went racing under Battersea Bridge at the same time as the tide being very high.

 Mal de debarquement syndrome means 'illness of disembarkation.'

It is a very rare condition that is triggered by travel, such as on a boat or plane. The symptoms last long after the journey has finished.

Instead of the usual symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, people with mal de debarquement syndrome feel as though they are rocking or bobbing, and may describe it as feeling as if they are still on the boat.

Many people feel like this for a few hours after a journey, but for people with mal de debarquement syndrome, the symptoms can last for months or even years.

There are currently not any known cures for the condition.

'I remember it was 6.30am and I leapt out of bed in absolute terror, the whole boat was violently rocking from side to side and I couldn’t get my bearings at all, I got off the boat as quickly as possible and went to work.

'That day I felt very unstable on my 
feet, I was literally rocking from side to side. I went to the chemist 
and bought myself acupressure wrist bands to ease the sickness and also 
sea sickness pills, neither of which helped in any way.

'That
night I was very nervous about being back on the boat. The next morning
the same thing happened and again, I left as quickly as possible.

With
the nausea and dizziness now unbearable, Ms Farrow took to the internet to
find out if there was anything she could do to ease the symptoms.

Having
previously suffered from labyrinthitis, an ear condition which can 
cause imbalance Ms Farrow thought she may be suffering from it again as the
symptoms she was experiencing were very similar.

She contacted a labryrinthist specialist and within twenty minutes of meeting him, he diagnosed her with MdDs.

Ms Farrow said: 'I was devastated, not only was there no cure, my symptoms at 
this point were unbearable and by now I was throwing up regularly, he 
suggested we move off the boat immediately and find somewhere else to 
live.

'Luckily some friends of ours came to the rescue and let us move into a flat of theirs they had bought to renovate.

'We moved the next day, having stayed on the boat for less than a week.'

'I
went for a series of vestibular tests and it was one of the most 
horrific three hours of my life as my balance and vision was put under 
exceptional testing.

'Again I was throwing up and for someone who rarely cries, I was weeping constantly as my life with these symptoms had become unbearable, I was begging for this torture to end.

'I was prepared to do anything, if only someone could take this condition away.'

But Ms Farrow was distraught to discover there was no cure for her condition and although her symptoms have eased over the years, she still faces a daily battle with the condition.

Ms Farrow and her family have since moved into their dream home which featured on homebuilding show, Grand Designs last year.

But she said despite living on dry land for the last two years there are still days when her symptoms are so severe she finds herself holding onto the wall to walk down the street.

She added: 'I have had MdDs for two years, and on some days my symptoms are so dreadful that I feel that awful misery coming back.

'Thankfully I love walking and one of the best things to do is to walk whilst looking left and right over and over again.

'Stress makes the symptoms worse, along with headaches. On days of stress and headaches I’m rocking and rolling all over the place.

'One of the things I find hard now, apart from living permanently with MdDs, is the fact that many people see it as an amusing and trifling illness.

'What they don’t understand is it is an incredibly invasive and life changing condition, the only relief I ever experienced was when I am driving or sleeping.

'I can no longer do many things that I was easily capable of.'
