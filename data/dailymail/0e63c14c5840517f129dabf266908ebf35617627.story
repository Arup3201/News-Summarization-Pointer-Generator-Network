Too young: 8-year-old Noshat Nahian died today after being truck by a tractor-trailer on his walk to school in Queens, New York

An 8-year-old Bangladeshi boy was fatally hit by a tractor-trailer this morning in Queens while walking to school on the last day of classes before holiday break.

Third-grader Noshat Nahian was walking with his 11-year-old sister to Public School 152 around 8am, clutching a red gift bag for his teacher, when driver Mauricio Osorio-Palominos struck the boy with the back wheels of his tractor-trailor.

Police arrested the 51-year-old from Newark, New Jersey when they discovered he was driving on a suspended license. He was headed southbound on sixty-first street, turning left onto Northern Boulevard, when the incident happened, just half a block from Noshat's school.

Noshat's mother usually walked her two children the four blacks to school, but stayed behind this morning.

Maria Humala, 38, was walking behind the siblings when the accident happened.

'The kid was wearing a hood and looking down, he kept walking and went under the truck,'Â  Ms Humala told the New York Post. 'The little girl was frozen beside him.'

A neighbor of the family's heard the sister scream and then saw the boy lying in the road, his face bloody with visibly broken limbs.

Noshat's sister ran home to get her mother, who met her son at Elmhurst Hospital. She was able to be with him when he later died.

Run over: The driver was turning left onto Northern Boulevard when he hit Noshat. The third-grader had on a hoodie and walked right under the tractor-trailer

Tragedy: Noshat was just half a block from his school when he was hit. He was carrying a red gift bag to give to his teacher on the last day of classes before holiday break

The driver seems received his commercial driving license in 1985 and has had 17 violations since then. His licesnse has been suspended and reinstated three times before.

In May 2012, he was cited for dangerous driving after getting into an accident.

Some of his past violations include failing to comply with police instruction, ignoring traffic signals, seat belt violations and speeding.

Osorio-Palominos owns his own trucking business - Gamosse transportation. He is the only employee of the one-truck business.

The boy's father, 40-year-old Mohammed Osma Miah, works as a delivery man for a rice wholesaler while his mother works at a store in Jackson Heights.

Mr Miah told DNAinfo that the family had moved from Bangladesh to the United States just months before after visiting family here.

He said they decided to stay because Noshat had fallen in love with the neighborhood in Queens.

'If we left that moment maybe he wouldn't have died,' he said.

Mr Miah was clearly distraught when being interviewed, wailing 'My son, my only son', and talked about how he was saving up to buy Noshat a laptop.

While Noshat's father blames himself, locals spoke about how dangerous the intersection is - pointing out that there's not usually a crossing guard stationed across the six-lane boulevard.

'That intersection is very dangerous,' 43-year-old Ruhel Hassan told the New York Times. 'People speed, and there's no crossing guard. Once my kid almost got run over.'

According to administrators at P.S. 152, crisis counselors have been brought in to any students who may need their help over the break.
