A presidential advisory panel has recommended sweeping limits on the government's surveillance programs, including requiring a court to sign off on individual searches of phone records.

It also recommends stripping the National Security Agency (NSA) of its ability to store that data from Americans.

It was unclear how the 40 recommended changes, if enacted, would impact the scope of the vast government surveillance programs. 

Presidential task force: An independent advisory panel ordered by President Obama on Wednesday recommended 40 changes to the NSA's surveillance programs

While President Barack Obama ordered the review board to submit recommendations following government spying disclosures earlier this year, he is under no obligation to accept the proposals.

The White House authorized the release of the review group's report Wednesday, weeks ahead of schedule.

The president was also conducting an internal review of the government's surveillance programs and planned to announce his decisions in January.

The review board's proposals address the government's ability to collect intelligence both in the United States and overseas.

The recommendations include tightening federal law enforcement's use of so-called national security letters, which give the government sweeping authority to demand financial and phone records without prior court approval in national security cases.

The task force recommended that authorities should be required to obtain a prior ‘judicial finding’ showing ‘reasonable grounds’ that the information sought is relevant to terrorism or other intelligence activities.

The panel was created amid a political firestorm that followed leaks last summer by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The disclosures triggered outrage among civil libertarians and many members of Congress, who considered the degree of data collection an overreach of post-9/11 anti-terror efforts.

Leaks about surveillance and a secret court that works with the NSA put enormous pressure on Obama, who came into office promising a more transparent government.

Key members of Congress are considering changes to programs under the Patriot Act law to restrict NSA snooping programs.

'The message is very clear,' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said following the report's release. 'NSA, you've gone too far, according to CNN.

Leahy mentioned the section in law allowing telephone data collection 'was not essential to preventing attacks,' according to the report.

That directly contradicts national security officials, who have said the authority had helped thwart terror plots both in the United States and abroad.

'Just because we can collect massive amounts of data doesn't mean we should do so,' Leahy said.

In addition, the panel proposed terminating the NSA's ability to store telephone data and instead require it to be held by the phone companies or a third party.

Access to the data would then be permitted only through an order from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

‘With regard to the bulk metadata of phone calls, we think there should be judicial review before that information is accessed and we don't think the government should retain it,’ said Richard Clarke, a member of the five-person panel.

If both recommendations were enacted, it's likely they would slow down the intelligence collection process.

The panel recommendations do allow for exceptions ‘in emergencies’, leaving open the possibility of intelligence agencies scanning the information quickly and asking for permission later if they suspect imminent attack.

Although the task force did not recommend ending any of the NSA's daily sweeps of telephone and Internet data, as some critics urged, a senior lawyer for one influential privacy advocate group said the review group's recommendations would amount to ‘sweeping’ changes in government policy if Obama accepts them in bulk.

The recommendations ‘will fuel the NSA reform effort both within the administration and in Congress’, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel with the Center for Democracy and Technology.

The panel also tackled the diplomatic furor over NSA spying on the leaders of allied nations, including Germany.

Michael Morell, a task force member and former deputy director of the CIA, says the panel is not trying to disarm the intelligence community

The group recommended that the president personally approve such spying and that the decisions be based in part on whether the United States shares ‘fundamental values and interests’ with the leaders of those nations.

‘Just because we can doesn't mean we should,’ Clarke said.

Panel members said they did not think any of the recommendations would harm U.S. national security.

‘We are not in any way recommending the disarming of the intelligence community,’ said Michael Morell, a task force member and former deputy director of the CIA.

‘We're not saying struggle against terrorism is over.
