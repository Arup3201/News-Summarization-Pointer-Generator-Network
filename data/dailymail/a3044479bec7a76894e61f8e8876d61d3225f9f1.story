From pus-filled lumps to hard 'granuloma' and damaged fatty tissue, the perils of having permanent filler are well documented.

But when a surgeon suggested that Deborah Kelly, a 47-year-old beauty tutor, have the treatment as a pre-wedding pick-me-up, she went ahead - even though she had originally opted for a safer, non-permanent version.

Now, years after having the treatment, she is plagued with painful pus-filled sores and says she couldn't even kiss her husband on her wedding day.

Pain: Deborah was left in agony after she agreed to have permanent filler injected into her lips

'He was very reassuring so I decided to 
have the injections because I'd already made my way there,' she says of the fateful moment she agreed to the jabs.

'I'd put my 
trust in the surgeon because you do, don't you? You assume that they know their job 
better than you do.'

Getting married for the first time in her early 40s, Deborah had wanted to look her best for her lavish Sri Lankan nuptials and hoped that the beauty jabs would boost her confidence.

'It's fair to say I've always been insecure about my looks,' she admits. 'I do have some problems with my skin which have led to a great deal of self-confidence issues.

'But to get married in my 40s and to the husband of my dreams - I wanted to look the best I possibly could.'

With the support of her husband-to-be, three months before the wedding, she decided to have a natural, non-permanent filler injected as a confidence boost.

Sore: The jabs led to the appearance of pus-filled lumps that were so painful, even kissing hurt

'The whole idea was that it would only last for three months so I would look lovely for the wedding and then get back to the natural look after the wedding,' she explains.

But after being talked into having a permanent boost instead, she was horrified by the almost instantaneous bad reaction she suffered.

'My lips swelled up like footballs,' she remembers. 'I've never seen anything like it. I was told to keep freezing them with ice packs.'

When the swelling subsided, she noticed painful lumps beginning to form in their place. 'I have never been in so much pain,' she adds. 'If you pushed onto my lips where the lumps were, they would swell up.'

Excruciating: Years after she had the jabs, Deborah remains in pain and still has lumps all over her lips

Ruined: Deborah on her wedding day which was spoiled by her painful lips

As her wedding day approached, the 
lumps continued to become increasingly agonising and by the time the big
 day arrived, they were so sore just brushing them caused her pain.

'I was slightly dreading the kiss, so it ended up as quite a quick kiss,' she remembers. 'We did embrace because it was our wedding day but my lips were stinging and starting to get a little bit bigger.

'I was disappointed because I really feel the fairytale that I had in my mind wasn't what I ended up with.'

The effects of the permanent filler also had an impact on the early years of her marriage and Deborah says she would love to be able to live a normal life again.

'Years after these injections, I still have sensitive lumps in my lips,' she adds. 'We were hoping they would go down, that we'd be able to kiss, hug and everything as a normal couple, but they haven't.'

Commenting on the case, cranio-facial plastic surgeon, Niall Kirkpatrick said: 'Sometimes in the early stages when you get lumps forming, steroid injections can be very effective.

'But when you're a few years down the line and have really solid, hard lumps, it's very rare that injections will settle them down.

'I spend a lot of my time trying to remove permanent fillers for patients who have had complications with them.'

He added: 'My personal feeling is that permanent fillers should be banned.'

Deborah appears on Botched Up Bodies: Brides, tomorrow at 10pm on Channel 5
