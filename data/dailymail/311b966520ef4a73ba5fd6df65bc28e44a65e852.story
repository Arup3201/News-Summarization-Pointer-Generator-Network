Doctors have used a student’s toe to create a new finger after he lost his as a child.

22-year-old Ha Yuan’s third finger on his left hand was severed during an accident as a child.

Although the missing finger hasn’t caused his any problems, he believes 
that now that he has graduated it had stopped him from getting a 
well-paid job as employers are put off by it.

Handy: Ha Yuan's toe 'finger' following his surgery. He lost the finger when he was a child

'My classmates all found jobs in the campus job fairs, but I was refused all the time once the employer saw my left hand.'

Surgeons in Changsha, capital of southern China's Hunan Province, managed to amputate a toe and use it to create a fully-functioning finger.

The second toe on Ha’s left foot was severed and attached onto his left hand.

'It's not easy to tell the difference if people are not looking at it closely,' said Doctor Lu.

'The only difference is the size of the nail.'

Doctor Lu added that it would take three months for the new 'finger' to resume functions.

'I feel my new life is about to start,' said Ha.

In 2011, Bristolian James Byrne had his big toe grafted on to his hand after he severed his left thumb while sawing through a piece of wood.

Surgeons had first tried to sew his original thumb back on but the blood would not start flowing again despite months of treatment, including using leeches.

That's when the surgeons made their unusual suggestion of using his dominant toe. They said losing a toe would only affect his balance in the short term - therefore outweighing the loss to his foot.

James's thumb was vital in his job as a paver and plant operator and as a father to son Connor, eight.
