The DVLA’s new car tax regime descended into chaos on its first day as both its website and telephone line crashed.

Paper tax discs were scrapped after 93 years yesterday in favour of an online system, causing the payment website to buckle under the weight of inquiries.

It is thought that tens of thousands of people mistakenly believed they could no longer pay the tax at their local post office and tried to use the DVLA’s website instead, leading to a surge in users.

 Drivers have faced issues with the new vehicle tax system overnight as DVLA scraps paper road tax discs

The DVLA posted on Twitter that it was experiencing 'unprecedented demand' as drivers rushed to renew

The website and its associated phone line became so swamped that they ground to a halt.

Both were also out of service for 12 hours from Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning for maintenance, which added to the problems.

Some 3.8million vehicles were due to have their tax renewed at the beginning of October.

A DVLA source confirmed that its system was overwhelmed, adding: ‘We have seen the highest single day online volumes as more people continue to move to our online service and away from the post office.’

The organisation issued a string of apologies on its official Twitter feed, posting on Tuesday evening: ‘If you are using our online car tax service tonight please keep trying. Unprecedented demand is causing slow responses – sorry about that.’

But many angry drivers also took to social media to vent their frustration. Some complained that it took up to four hours to complete a process that should take a matter of minutes, while others said they simply could not pay their tax at all and were worried about being fined.

Another DVLA tweet advised drivers to ring its customer service line, which costs up to 40p a minute from a mobile phone.

But on calling, many people were simply faced with a recorded message telling them to ring back later due to the high volume of inquiries.

In a report to the Commons transport select committee earlier this year, the AA warned that the DVLA’s computer systems may not be capable of handling the new regime. 

Yesterday AA president Edmund King said: ‘It’s a bit ironic in this digital age that the site goes down on the first day of the electronic system coming into being.

‘I think that not only a lot of people have tried to get on to the site to renew their car tax, but also a number have tried to access the site to find out how the changes to the car tax system affect them.’

Now paper discs have been scrapped, police and traffic wardens will use cameras or handheld computers linked to the DVLA’s database, and be automatically alerted if an untaxed car is on the road.

The Government claims the new system will be more efficient and cheaper to run.

However, critics have suggested that without the need to display a disc, the number of motorists failing to pay their car tax could soar as high as the number who drive without insurance.

The payment website and phone line were up and running again by 5pm yesterday.

Last night, the DVLA apologised for the problems and suggested its telecoms provider, Vodafone, may have been responsible.

A DVLA spokesman said: ‘Vodafone’s engineers worked hard with us to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

‘Vodafone will continue to monitor the service closely and will be carrying out a full investigation.’ 

The screen that several motorists have faced when trying to apply for new road tax since DVLA system failed

Vehicle tax was introduced in the 1888 budget.

The Roads Act 1920 required councils to 'register all new vehicles and to allocate a separate number to each vehicle' and 'make provision for the collection and application of the excise duties on mechanically propelled vehicles and on carriages'. 

And so the requirement to display a tax disc was introduced in 1921.

More than 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since then and if they were put in a line, they would go around the world three times.

Last year, the DVLA issued 42.2million tax discs weighing more than 72 tonnes.

From October 1, 2014 motorists were no longer required to display the paper disc in the windows and a new digital system relying on road traffic cameras was introduced. 

Motorists will still have to pay tax on their vehicles, but will no longer have to display a disc in their windscreen 

The paper discs were in use for 93 years but have been scrapped in a scheme set to save £20million a year
