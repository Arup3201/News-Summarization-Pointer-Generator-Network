It is estimated that a billion people watched the World Cup Final last night, but the way they tuned-in varied massively depending on where they were based.

From huge fan parks in Berlin and army camps in Afghanistan, to the war-torn back streets of Aleppo in Syria and entire communities gathered around a single television in the favela districts of Rio de Janeiro - the World Cup Final had a truly global audience.

During the match, 32.1million tweets were posted relating to the clash between Germany and Argentina - with a surprisingly large number posted outside the stereotypical footballing hotspots of Europe and South America - proving once and for all that football the ability to bring the entire world to a temporary standstill, from expensive restaurants in the wealthiest cities, to run-down cafes in a war zone.

Massive turnout: One of the biggest single gatherings anywhere on earth took place, unsurprisingly, in the German capital Berlin, where 250,000 fans came together to watch the match on huge screens in an area dubbed the 'Fan Mile', close to the famous Brandenburg Gate

Jubilation: Germany fans on holiday in Palma de Mallorca, Spain celebrate their nation winning the World Cup for the fourth time

One of the biggest single gatherings anywhere on earth took place, unsurprisingly, in the German capital Berlin, where 250,000 fans came together to watch the match on huge screens in an area dubbed the 'Fan Mile', close to the famous Brandenburg Gate. 

Flares illuminated the stage and sent plumes of smoke into the sky as Mario
 Goetze took the ball on his chest and let fly inside the far post from a
 narrow angle to win the match in its closing stages.

Fans cheered, clapped and shouted, with 
large groups of strangers hugging and jumping into the air together, 
making so much noise the commentary on the large screens could no longer
 be heard.

'We're
 going to be world champions! We're going to be world champions!' yelled
 the compere of the public viewing event, even before the second period 
of extra-time was over in Brazil.

Long way from home: German soldiers at Camp Marmul in Mazar-e-shari, Afghanistan, leap into the air with joy as the final whistle blows in the 2014 World Cup final

Passion: German soldiers serving in a NATO-led peacekeeping mission celebrate their team's World Cup victory at a military base in Prizren, Kosovo

The party 
was already underway all across Germany, though there were a couple of 
nervous moments before the revelers could really let themselves go.

Some
 50,000 fans attended the Fan-Arena at St. Pauli's stadium in Hamburg, 
while supporters brought their sofas to watch the World Cup games at 
Union Berlin's Alte Foersterei stadium.

Sadly, in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aries, things were far less peaceful.

Riot
 police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a group of 
rock-throwing vandals who disturbed a rally by Argentines celebrating 
their team's gutsy but ultimately unsuccessful performance.

Thousands of Argentines, saddened but 
proud, had gathered peacefully at the iconic Obelisk in downtown Buenos 
Aires to applaud their team's best World Cup performance in 24 years.

Frustration: Thousands of football fans - many of them supporting the eventual losers Argentina - gathered to watch the match on a big screen in Sydney, Australia

Break: Israeli soldiers watch the World Cup Final in a restaurant in Kibbutz Yad Mordechay, close to border with Gaza. Tensions in the region have dramatically escalated over the past week, with Israeli air strikes on Gaza and rocket fire on Israel continuing

Police initially remained on the sidelines as fans poured into downtown Buenos Aires. But late Sunday night they began chasing down vandals.

The 
youths, many of them with their faces covered and drinking heavily, 
responded by hurling rocks, destroying store fronts, tearing down street
 lights and even breaking into a theater.

Police said 20 officers were injured and at least 60 people were arrested.

The chaotic situation marred what was an otherwise spontaneous show of support for Argentina's national team. 

The
 centre of festivities was the Obelisk, where fans traditionally gather 
to celebrate victory, not defeat. Cars honked staccato rhythms, 
firecrackers were tossed into the air and fans of all ages jumped in 
place shouting 'Argentina! Argentina! Argentina!'

Tension: Despite the ongoing civil war, Syrians were not immune to the joys of the World Cup Final. Here young boys sit holding footballs in their hands, barely able to take their eyes off the screen as they watch Germany beat Argentina

Escapism: Syrians watch the World Cup Final in the al-Firdous neighborhood of the war-torn northern city of Aleppo

The match was watched with similar passion outside the countries actually fighting to win the World Cup.

In London, German-themed pubs and bars were filled with delighted expats as they gathered to watch their national team win the World Cup.

At the Zeitgeist pub in Vauxhall several hundred fans of Die Mannschaft erupted with joy at the final whistle, spraying beer everywhere to start a party that went on long into the night.

One fan, called Jorg, said: 'It's 
unbelievable. This is the second World Cup I have witnessed us winning 
since I was born, the first I was too young to realise, this one has 
been a dream.'

Global sport: This heat map shows Twitter activity during last night's World Cup final. As one would expect, many of the 32.1million tweets referencing the match were sent from Europe and South America, but the U.S, South East Asia and the Middle East were not far behind

Tears: Argentina fans react after the team's loss to Germany in their 2014 World Cup final soccer match in Brazil, at a public square viewing area in Buenos Aire

There were similar scenes across Western Europe with pubs, cafes and restaurant in Paris, Brussels, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Milan packed to capacity.

Meanwhile in
 Brazil, fans in Rio's Mare favela district were able set aside the 
disappointment of their own team's failure to reach the final to cheer 
Germany to victory over their hated rivals Argentina in the Maracana 
stadium just a few miles away.

In
 Peru's capital Lima, prisoners at the Lurigancho jail took time out of 
staging their own mini football tournament between different prison 
wings to watch the final.

Despite the ongoing civil war there, 
Syrians were not immune to the joys of the World Cup Final. In the 
war-torn city of Homs, a large screen was erected outside the Bayt 
al-Agha restaurant, which still boasts beautiful Ottoman-era arches.

This is despite having been partially destroyed during months of fighting between rebels and government forces in the city.

Making music: German fans (pictured) who were already in Brazil but didn't have tickets to the final, watched the match on screens on Rio's Copacabana beach

North American support: Hundreds of fans - many of them supporting the favourites Germany - cheer on their heroes in an large outdoor viewing area in Toronto, Canada

Also in Syria, young boys wore football shirts of their favourite teams while gathered in a basic cafe in Aleppo.

Sitting alongside adults, the boys held footballs in their hands and could barely take their eyes off the screen as they watched Germany beat Argentina.

The residents of Egypt's Manshiyet
 Nasr - which has the unflattering nickname Garbage City - took time out
 from their work of collecting and recycling the majority of the rubbish
 produced in the capital Cairo to crowd into coffee and shisha bars to 
watch the match.

Meanwhile
 in cities across Yemen, residents were not put off by security and 
economic problems and turned out to watch the match in force.

Electricity
 blackouts are common in houses around the country, so 60 
generator-powered big screens were set up in public spaces to ensure 
thousands of fans were able to watch the game without interruption.

Here children walk along a handmade bridge over a polluted stream, with the Maracana stadium just a few miles away

At the more extreme end of viewing locations is Antarctica, where scientists at the Rothera research station stopped their work to cheer on the teams.

The match was even beamed outside Earth so the five men onboard the International Space Station wouldn't be left out.

German astronaut Alexander Gerst - the only man in space with a stake in the World Cup Final - congratulated the team from the International Space Station on its 'top performance.'

He tweeted a picture of himself in a Germany jersey with an extra fourth star - 'as experts on stars, we already got one.'
