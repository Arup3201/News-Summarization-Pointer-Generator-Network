This is the moment a leaping spider that has menaced a family for five years was dramatically lured from its hole to catch a fake fly.

The Gibson family recorded the moment they confronted the green-fanged creature, which they say has been living in a hole behind their garage wall in Plymouth, Devon, since 2009.

Father-of-three James, 27, is convinced the same spider - which he says is a Segestria florentina, more commonly known as a tube web spider - has been lurking above the door frame ever since.

This is the moment a jumping spider that has menaced a family for five years leapt from its hole, after being lured out by a fake fly

After a fake fly at the end of a stick is used to poke the hole, the spider could be seen charging out of its nest in a bid to snare the pretend insect

But after his 24-year-old wife Katy grew tired of living with the spider, the Gibsons decided it was time to  lure the eight-legged creature out of its lair.

The family initially tried to provoke the spider with a stick. But when the plan failed, their four-year-old son Charlie up with a better idea.

He suggested to his parents that they could use one of his toys - which has a fake fly attached to a stick - to poke the spider's hole. 

In the footage, the spider is seen charging out of its nest in a bid to snare the pretend insect, as Mr Gibson's father prods the hole.

But, within a split-second, the speedy spider has scurried back up the wall and retreated back into its nest.

Mr Gibson, a precision engineer, said: 'We first noticed the spider about five years ago. I'm sure its the same one.

'There are tonnes of spiders living in the garage but most of them are just average - this one has a really menacing look to it.

'He lives in a little hole which is on the doorframe walking into the garage but comes out to peer down at his web. 

'My dad used the fly puppet to gently touch the web and the spider hurtled out. He moved really fast - before you knew it he was right back in his hole.'

Mr Gibson and his three children - Charlie, four, Harry, three and Olivia, two - call the spider 'Mr Long Legs' because of its size.

They had previously tried to lure the creature using a normal stick, but did not have any luck.

Tube-web spiders are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps.

They sow distinctive tube-shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands.

They first entered the UK 150 years ago from continental Europe, arriving on ships docking in ports. 

The females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm. 

If left undisturbed, domestic house spiders can live as long as seven years in the same web in places like attics, basements, and garages.

Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm.

Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year.

They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours.

They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it.

Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique.

Kelvin Boot, a naturalist and former BBC radio presenter, said the tube web spider might look scary but says it’s not dangerous to humans.

He said: ‘It bites in defence so if you pick one up, or it gets caught in your clothing, you are likely to be nipped. But no British spider delivers a fatal bite or even one dangerous to humans.

‘It seems this spider was accidentally introduced into UK from its native Mediterranean and North Africa.

‘It sits at the mouth of its tunnel in old brickwork or behind loose bark or any other suitable hole, waiting for a hapless insect to stumble across the spokes - tripwires that alert the spider to its victim.

‘Once detected, the spider moves like lightning. I defy anybody not to jump when this happens as it is such a surprise even if you are expecting it.

‘The prey is dragged back into the narrow tube and eventually the spider’s venom overcomes the prey.’ 

Stuart Hine, from the Angela Marmont Centre Manager at the Natural History Museum, said: ‘They can fall, or plunge if they are on a wall, but you wouldn’t really describe it as jumping.

'Equally if you came across a male out of his silk tube and provoked him by poking him he could probably just about raise a hop, but they are certainly not considered jumping spiders.’
