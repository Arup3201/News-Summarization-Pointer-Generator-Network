It's Whistler Mountain Bike Park - but only as daredevils have experienced it.

This GoPro footage, shot by extreme mountain-biker Remy Metailler, shows what it feels like to plunge head-first down a vertical drop. 

Breathing heavily, the thrill-seeker, from Vancouver, Canada, perches his yellow bike precariously on the edge of a hill - before wildly careering down the bumpy terrain. 

Frightening: Cyclist Remy Metailler filmed while riding along a vertical drop at Whistler Mountain Bike Park

Mr Metailler steadies the bike in preparation for his descent, gripping tight on the handlebars while taking in the adrenaline-fueled tracks the Canadian park.

His GoPro POV camera shows the surrounding scenery of sharp rocks, jutting out dangerously from a cliff-face.

Readying himself for the drop, the cyclist releases the brakes gradually so that the bike rolls forwards.

Huge boulders stick out on the surface, making this one very dangerous and bumpy ride.

The camera shakes as the wheels of the bicycle roll over the big stones and rocks in its path. 

The bicycle coasts slowly at first but soon gather speed as the rough rocks give way to a smoother surface.

The Canadian mountain bike park has trails of varying difficulty with everything from gentle rides though the coastal forests to steep rock faces and root strewn paths.

Whistler Mountain Bike Park is well known for its sustained stretches of downhill riding as the park lifts give riders access to higher tracks, which allow them to ride much more vertical trails than they normally would be able to.
