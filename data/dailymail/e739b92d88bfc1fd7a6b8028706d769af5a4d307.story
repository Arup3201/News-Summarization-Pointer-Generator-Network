With Valentine's Day just around the corner one adventurous couple are raising the stakes when it comes to extravagant romantic gestures by continuing their never-ending honeymoon - which has seen them visit 24 countries so far.

Jeff and Jennifer Salvage, from Medford, New Jersey, have combined their passion for travelling with their passion for romance by capturing hundreds of pictures of Jennifer in her wedding dress in various exotic locations.

The intrepid couple have now clocked up more than 200,000 miles, with Jennifer, 43, playing the brushing bride over and over again while being photographed by her husband for 205 shoots in 24 countries on six continents.

The pair began their unusual adventure after they got married more than six years ago, in 2008.

And since first hitting the headlines two years ago, they show no signs of slowing down - recently ticking another five countries off their hit list: Australia, Jordan, Thailand, Cambodia and Singapore.

New footage and pictures show Jennifer snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef, riding a camel in Jordan, visiting a floating market in Thailand and swimming in the Dead Sea - all while wearing the same white wedding dress.

The picture perfect bride is also captured playing with tigers at Tiger Kingdom in Phuket, braving a jungle swing in Cairns and visiting the incredible Supertree Grove in Singapore.

Jeff, 47, a professional photographer, said: 'The gown has shown astounding durability, travelling in a backpack, slogging through mud and snow, swimming underwater, flying in a harness, and, of course, enduring many trips to the cleaners.

'People often ask what our dry cleaning bill must be like, but because the dress is made with stretch lace over jersey it has unbelievable durability, we just take it to our $1.99 dry cleaner after each trip.

'We thought for sure the dress would have been destroyed in Jordan. It was subjected to the extremes of the desert heat, a pop-up sand storm and the corrosive waters of the Dead Sea. However, after a quick trip to the dry cleaners it was ready for more.

'People sometimes assume that we have an unlimited travel budget but we don't. Instead we travel through very cost effective means.

'Sometimes we combine trips with charity work and we have also collected hundreds of thousands of frequent flyer miles from cycling through credit card offers.

'We're more comfortable in a quaint youth hostel than a posh five star hotel and we always make our money stretch.'

When they're not travelling the pair also work in schools - Jennifer as a guidance counsellor and Jeff as a computer-science professor - which means both have long summer holidays for country-hopping.

After originally tying the knot on Easter Island, Chile, in 2008, the pair decided to relive their wedding in as many different locations as possible - creating a truly inspiring series of pictures dubbed One Dress. One Woman. One World which was published as a coffee table book in 2010.

Jennifer's bridal gown was designed to be carried in a backpack  to suit their nuptials in the remote location of Easter Island  but the dress would be stuffed into a rucksack on hundreds of occasions after that.

On their website, Jennifer explains that their adventure began when she was looking for a wedding gown to wear to the ceremony they had planned on the edge of a volcano on the South Pacific island.

Since the dress would need to be 'flown over 7,000 miles, driven across an isolated island, and hand-carried up a sacred volcano crater,' Jennifer wanted one that 'could be stuffed in a backpack'.

She ultimately chose a strapless Destinations by Maggie Sottero gown with white lace overlay. 

On  Easter Island, Jeff set about trying to capture Jennifer in her dress in the best light, an endeavor that continued on into their honeymoon in the Alps and China.

Since then, the couple have embarked on photoshoots in 24 countries: Chile, Switzerland, China, the U.S., Egypt, New Zealand, Hungary, France, Italy, Vatican, Peru, Iceland, Norway, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Grand Cayman, Honduras, Greece and Russia - and now also Jordan, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Australia.

According to the website: 'Jennifer and her dress have travelled across the world in search of adventure, beauty, an excuse to never end her honeymoon with Jeff.'

The couple say the wedding dress photos have been a fun addition to their travels as well as a way for them to commemorate their most special day. 

Their most recent adventures are documented in photo book called When it Clicks which is accompanied by Jennifer's memoir entitled When it Clicks - One Woman's Journey from Solo Hiker to Model Wife.

Jeff added: 'As long as it is still fun and is bringing us together as a couple, we'll keep travelling and photographing Jennifer in the dress.

'Of course the project will evolve over time. A recent shoot ended with Jennifer fracturing her ribs, so perhaps it's time to limit the daredevil shots.

'But we're already planning our next big adventure - a summer trip to Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Spain.

'We didn't intend to do this. We got married in the world's most remotely inhabited place - Easter Island. The bottom line was we wanted to find the most romantic place in the world.

'I wanted iconic wedding pictures and on the day the lighting wasn't perfect so I took some more of Jen the next day, during sunrise and sunset.

'Then in the summer months that followed we went hiking in the Alps and then to China and took a few more pictures of Jen in her dress. We just thought to ourselves we should take another wedding dress picture here and there.

'We travelled through some really remote parts of China and at first people thought they had stumbled upon a wedding, then they realised it was something much cooler.

'I decided at that point to take my passion and make it our project. They're going to be great to look back on, the photos are the memories.'
