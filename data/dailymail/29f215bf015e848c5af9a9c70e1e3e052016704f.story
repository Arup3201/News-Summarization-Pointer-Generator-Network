A man indicted for the murder of his second wife and under investigation for the suspicious death of his first in 'glaringly similar' circumstances may have plotted to kill a third woman – his sister-in-law – according to newly submitted court documents.

Harold Henthorn was indicted for the murder of his second wife, Toni, 50, last November.

The indictment was the result of a two-year investigation during which the FBI eavesdropped on the Colorado widower's telephone conversations, combed through his finances, scrutinized his employment history and concluded that the 'freak' hiking accident that claimed the mother-of-one's life was murder.

Dr Toni Jill Bertolet Henthorn plunged 140 feet to her death while on a remote hike with Henthorn who was the only witness to her death.

Twenty years earlier Henthorn was the only witness to the 'freak accident' that killed first wife, Lynn Rishell. 

She was crushed under the front of his Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark.

In both cases Henthorn stood to benefit from substantial life insurance policies taken out on the women in his name.

Now new court documents have revealed that the prosecution will submit 'evidence that Harold Henthorn killed his first wife and collected life insurance on her to establish intent, motive, planning, preparation and lack of accident' in the death of his second.

And, shockingly, the court papers have revealed that, in 2009, Henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his sister-in-law, Grace Rishell, who was married to his first wife's brother.

Grace Rishell was going through a divorce and 'concerned for her financial stability,' when she initially agreed to Henthorn taking out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000.

According to the prosecution, 'The evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell.'

The documents reveal that Rishell had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer.

But unbeknownst to Grace Rishell, 'her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well.'

Henthorn made payments on the policy until December 2012 and instead of listing her daughter as brothers as beneficiaries, the policy listed only Henthorn.

The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in Rishell.

Family: Dr Henthorn, a skilled ophthalmologist, left behind a seven-year-old daughter when she died in 2012

Mystery: Harold Henthorn told authorities his wife slipped on a steep mountainside while taking a photo 

Henthorn, who was arrested on November 6 when FBI swooped on the 59-year-old returning home after dropping his daughter, Hayley, 9, at school, was was denied bail by US District Judge Kathleen Latoyfa.

Ms Latoyfa described him as a 'danger' and noted, 'there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second,' and pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was 'hiding funds.'

Though Henthorn claimed to work as a fundraiser for a charity the economic crime auditor for the US Attorney found no evidence that the geology graduate from Virginia had any earnings other than some in 1993, 1999 and 2000.

The only job he appears to have had was one briefly held in the petroleum industry – the job that saw him and his then new bride, Lynn Rishell, move from their hometown of Harrington, Virginia, across the country to Colorado.

Now in documents that provide further damning detail of the deaths of both Toni Bertolet Henthorn and Lynn Rishell Henthorn the prosecution has highlighted the similarities between both women's passing.

Both deaths, the documents state, 'involved bizarre 'accidents.' Both left Henthorn with significant insurance benefits. He is beneficiary or trustee on three policies on Toni, totaling around $4.5million and received a $500,000 pay out on the death of his first wife.

Both occurred in remote locations. Both times Henthorn was the lone witness.

Both deaths occurred after about 12 years of marriage. Henthorn told wildly varying stories about both deaths.

According to the documents the man who met his second wife on a Christian dating website, even told a Sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy.

In the case of his second wife, an incident which happened just two years after she almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam Harold had thrown off their deck is disclosed in the documents.

After that incident, Harold joked to friends: 'I was trying to kill my wife.'  

In both situations, the documents continue, the women were doing atypical things when they died.

Lynn Henthorn was 'fastidious in dress and a cautious women who would not ordinarily crawl under a jacked-up car to search for lug nuts while wearing a nice sweater, especially after exploratory surgery only two weeks earlier.'

Scene: The couple were on an anniversary hike - they had been married 12 years - on Deer Mountain in Rocky Mountains National Park on September 29, 2012 when Dr Henthorn fell to her death

Toni Henthorn 'was not likely to scramble down a rocky face on bad knees to look over a cliff in the midst of a tough hike at elevation.'

Investigators have also established that Henthorn 'extensively scouted' the fatal hike. Contrary to what he told law enforcement he made nine different trips to the area around Rocky Mountain Park that summer. And the fortnight before their anniversary – the date of her death – Henthorn had hiked six trails to 'find the perfect one for the trip.'

Damningly a map found in Henthorn's car suggested that the detours Henthorn claimed to have preceded his wife's fall were not, as he stated spontaneous: it marked the spot near where Toni fell with a pink X.

In both situations Harold was eager to have the bodies quickly cremated despite family requests against it.

And, disturbingly, Harold spread both women's ashes on the same mountain near Ouray, Colorado.

Henthorn has not been indicted for the murder of his first wife and has entered a not guilty plea on the murder of his second. The trial date is set for May 4 – 15.
