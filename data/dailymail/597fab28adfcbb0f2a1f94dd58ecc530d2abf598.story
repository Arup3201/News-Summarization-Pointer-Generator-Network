Hospitals should be policed by an army of inspectors that include doctors and nurses to prevent major scandals and unnecessary deaths, a landmark report will warn next week.

The long-awaited  public inquiry into the scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust is expected to recommend more experienced inspectors and an overhaul of the regulatory system.  

The report will recommend drastic reforms of how hospitals are policed in an attempt to stop a repeat of events at Stafford hospital where up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly over a four-year period,  reports The Guardian.

Up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly over a four-year period at Stafford Hospital, where patients were found to have been treated 'appallingly'

The £11million inquiry, led by Robert Francis QC, is examining 
what went wrong at the trust between January 2005 and March 2009.

Between 
400 and 1,200 more people died than would have been expected over that period, the Commission said.

Mr Francis' first report in 2010 found there was often 'shocking' care at Stafford hospital.

Many patients were 'neglected', with 
calls for help to use the bathroom ignored, food and drink left out of 
patients' reach, pain relief administered late or not at all, 'awful' 
hygiene, and much more.

Some staff showed 'a disturbing lack of compassion', while 'fear and bullying' dissuaded others from flagging up their concerns.

Doctors were diverted from critically
ill patients to deal with less serious cases that were at risk of 
breaching a central target to discharge all patients from Accident &
Emergency units within four hours. 

Vulnerable patients were left so thirsty that they were forced to drink water out of flower vases; others were left starving and 
in soiled bedsheets.

Last month, the scandal-hit hospital
paid out more than £1million in 
compensation for 'inhumane and degrading' treatment.

The new army of inspectors is thought to be in response to the fact that such serious failings occurred despite there being various regulatory bodies in place.

Huge questions remain over how such appalling standards of care continued for so long and why the relevant authorities did not intervene.

Francis is expected to call for hospitals to undergo more regular and thorough inspections. 

A key move will be to get more experts with clinical experience, such as doctors and nurses, to join the 
955 inspectors currently used by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in NHS 
hospital visits.

Many of the current inspectors are thought to have a background in care homes and social work rather than the NHS.

In future, Monitor, which regulates NHS trusts, will be expected to share concerns about financial problems so the CQC can check if patient care is being affected.

And to tackle problems earlier, a recommendation will be made that the CQC's use of intelligence about hospital care is bolstered, using information from patient complaints, media reports and the results of clinical audits.
