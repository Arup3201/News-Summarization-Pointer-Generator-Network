Starving dogs kept in a Romanian dog shelter where they were forced to eat each other to stay alive were rescued when a volunteer from a local animal protection group stumbled across them.

Horrified Nicolae Vasile, 24, had gone to the state-funded public shelter in the town of Baia Mare in northern Romania to transfer some of the strays to his NGO Baia Mare Dog Shelter and eventually put them up for adoption.

But as he entered the kennels where the dogs were being kept he found the half-mutilated corpse of one dog and others dying from starvation.

Rescued: Both of these dogs were saved from appalling conditions in a Romanian dog shelter where animals were forced to eat each other to stay alive

He said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I knew the conditions here are bad which is why I was here to take some away.

'But what I was confronted with was like something out of hell. The staff admitted that the dog had been killed by the others out of starvation.'

Video and photos taken by Mr Vasile show the remains of a black dog with half of its intestines hanging out.

Another shows a dog so weak it can hardly stand up as other dogs are heard barking from their cages.

Shocking: A dead dog lies on its side in a cage, where it was killed and eaten by another desperate and starving animal 

The disgusted animal-lover added: 'I took four of the worst kept ones back to our shelter and we are now caring for them.

'We took eight last week. I hope they all live.'

When confronted with the sickening images local mayor Catalin Cereches wrote on his Facebook page: 'Tomorrow it [the shelter] will be closed. Have a nice evening.'

The shocking photos and videos have caused outrage.

Saved: This dog was one of the lucky ones as it was still alive when Nicolae Vasile arrived at the shelter and discovered the appalling conditions 

Appalled Michelle Jacques wrote: 'How can people let this happen? Seriously? B*****ds, utterly detestable. 

'Thank you for rescuing the other four and it's sad to say but after all that he went through at least he is now at peace and never has to suffer at the hands of man ever again. Sleep well little one.'

Fuksz Mihaela Cnta posted 'I can't believe it - it's terrifying' and Paul Preda said: 'We hope the mayor will do something'.
