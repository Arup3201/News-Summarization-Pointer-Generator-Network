Grand finale: The Queen's granddaughter will carry the iconic flame down the finishing straight of the racecourse in Gloucestershire tomorrow

Zara Phillips spent today preparing to bring a royal touch to the next leg of the Olympic torch relay around Britain.

The Queen's granddaughter will carry the iconic flame down the finishing straight of the Cheltenham Racecourse in Gloucestershire tomorrow.

The 31-year-old will be riding her faithful horse, Toytown, who is now retired, and will light a cauldron at the racecourse, which will burn throughout the country-wide event.

She met torchbearers Eleanor Smallwood, 15, and Toby Jones, 15, as well as children from Chilton Foilat Primary School in Hungerford, as the flame was carried from Taunton to Glastonbury to Bristol in the west of the country.

Meanwhile, a woman was warming up to carry the torch today - just seven days after giving birth to her new-born son.

Eleanore Regan, 28, was supposed to run with the flame while heavily pregnant, but gave birth to William eight days early, last Wednesday.

The charity worker, who is also battling a brain tumour, still ran 300-metres through Bath, Somerset, with the torch yesterday while tiny William looked on.

The torch resumed its epic journey at 8am this morning, starting in Taunton and heading through Ilminster and Glastonbury towards Bristol, where it ended the day at around 6pm .

Ms Regan was selected for her tireless work over more than a decade to improve the lives of individuals and communities across the UK, Eastern Europe and Africa.

She set up Challenge Africa after a trip to Kenya, and Joanna Lumley is now patron of the charity.

The mother of one, who is leading a fundraising group climbing Mount Kilimanjaro next year, is looking forward to the responsibility of carrying the torch, despite being heavily pregnant.

'This is such a great time for the country. I feel proud to be able to carry the flame amongst such inspirational people and in such a beautiful city,' she said.

Organisers will be hoping for a repeat of the crowded streets during the first three days of the relay when excited onlookers gathered to catch a glimpse of the torch as it made its way from Cornwall to Somerset.

An Olympic torch bearer who sold her torch for £153,100 on eBay says she faces a £15,000 bill to settle the auction site’s selling fees because the winning bidder has so far failed to come forward.

Sarah Milner Simonds, 38, has attracted attention in recent days since controversially placing her official torch and uniform on eBay to raise money for the community gardening group The People’s Plot.

The community gardener - who ran with the flame through Dunster, Somerset, on Monday - said she was overjoyed and flabbergasted to find the auction had raised £153,100.

But since the auction ended at 10.33pm on Sunday after attracting 163 bids, Sarah says the winning bidder has not been in touch and she fears it may have been a hoax.

She said: 'EBay has strict rules stating bids are legally binding contracts and an invoice has been sent to the bidder for £153,100, but we have received no response so far.

The buyer has a 100 per cent positive feedback rating based on previous purchases but just seems to have disappeared.'

'This is incredibly disappointing not only because The People’s Plot will miss out on this wonderful funding, but because it could now leave me out-of-pocket too. eBay has already been in contact asking me to pay the 10 per cent selling fee for the item, amounting to over £15,000.

'We just hope that the winning bidder comes forward and fulfils the deal.'

Yesterday, rapper and music producer Will.i.am made a surprise appearance and carried the torch in Taunton town centre.

He is one of several celebrities joining unsung heroes carrying the torch in areas including Glastonbury, Bath and Bristol today on the flame's journey through Britain.

The torchbearers range in age from children to 91-year-old Doris Whiting.

Mrs Whiting will be one of the oldest of the 8,000 torchbearers who will carry the Olympic flame on the way to the July 27 opening ceremony.

The nonagenarian, from Trowbridge, will carry the flame through Shepton Mallet.

Her nomination says he received an MBE in 2008 to recognise more than 30 years of community work.

'Doris is one of the few people I know who is instantly recognised by just her first name. Mention the name Doris in Trowbridge and everyone knows who you mean,' her nominator said.

'Not only Doris herself, but a great many in Trowbridge too would be delighted if she were to be selected for the honour of carrying the flame. A fitting climax to a long life of ceaseless service to the community.'

There is also dedicated Gavin Harvey, 31, from Salisbury, who will carry the torch in Frome.

He lost both legs while injured in a bomb blast while serving the Army in Afghanistan in August 2009.

His wife, who nominated him, says: 'He lost both his legs, shattered his pelvis and suffered multiple internal injuries after spending 10 and a half weeks in hospital he was finally discharged.

'Since then he has been an inspiration to all who know him in his determination to live life to the full and still be a very active father to our two very young daughters.'

A former heavy drinker and smoker who saw the error of her ways will carry the torch through Bristol.

Joanne Plumbley, 36, from Tytherington, grew up disliking exercise but changed her lifestyle after joining the Territorial Army.

'Joanne grew up hating strenuous activity and was notoriously bad at games and sport,' her nominator says.

'By 20 she was a heavy drinker and smoker when she had a significant health scare. Subsequently she joined the Territorial Army as a combat medic which proved strong motivation for exercise.'

A man who became a marathon runner after losing 14 stone in 18 months will be also be in the spotlight.

In Bath, 19-year-old James Eynon will be a torchbearer after being nominated for helping in a campaign to save his former school in the city from closure.

He said: 'My radio interviews speeches and pieces in the local newspaper helped to overturn a decision to close my school just weeks before the closure was finalised.

'I have already shown that if you put your mind to things you can achieve your desired goal.'

There are 16 ‘core vehicles’ assigned to accompany the torch for its epic journey.

Everywhere the procession goes, a small army of support and ancilliary vehicles is also called into service. In Cornwall on Saturday, for example, the convoy was escorted by police motorcyclists bearing the emblems of five separate constabularies.

In south Devon, an ambulance, local dignitaries, firearms officers and police ‘safety officers’ on BMW mountain bikes joined the parade.

It was a similar turnout yesterday in north Devon and Somerset, with a bomb disposal team in the convoy.

The London Olympic organising committee insists the vehicle fleet is necessary for what it describes as a ‘huge’ logistical operation, adding that each one has a specific and important role.

For the three most prominent vehicles on parade, that role is mostly commercial. Sponsors Coca-Cola, Samsung and Lloyds TSB each have a truck or coach kitted out in brand-name colours and they travel full time with the convoy.

By the time the convoy gets to the Olympic stadium in July it will have left a massive carbon footprint.

Dr Wendy Buckley, director of Carbon Footprint Ltd, which helps organisations to become carbon neutral, told the Daily Mail that if 47 was a typical daily average for vehicles, they were likely to emit a total of 223 tons of carbon dioxide.

That would be equivalent to driving a Toyota Prius hybrid car more than 1.4million miles.

Alternatively, of course, the runners could borrow a tip from ancient Greece – and just run.

The flame went out briefly after it was fixed to the side of para-badminton star David Follett’s wheelchair for his torch-bearing stint in Great Torrington, near Bideford. Another torch was quickly lit, with organisers blaming a ‘malfunctioning burner’.
