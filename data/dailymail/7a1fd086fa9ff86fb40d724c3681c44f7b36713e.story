Benedict Cumberbatch wrote a heartfelt letter to the family of a 14-year-old Sherlock fan, apologising for missing her funeral because he was 'filming the show she loved'.

The 38-year-old actor wrote the open letter to the parents of Eve Shepherd, sending his 'deepest sympathies' and explaining why he could not attend.

The touching letter, signed off 'God rest her soul', was read out during the teenager's funeral, where mourners donned deerstalker hats - often worn by fictional detective Sherlock Holmes - to mark Eve's love of the BBC programme.

The congregation also left the church listening to the Sherlock Holmes theme tune. 

The letter read: 'I send my deepest sympathies to Eve's family. To lose someone so young who fought for her health all her life must be beyond endurance.

'I hope they can take solace from the fact that she was clearly much loved and her support of our show is hugely appreciated and shall be remembered.

'I wish I could be there but sadly am filming the show she loved. God rest her soul. With all my love and sympathies, Benedict xxx'.

Eve, from Padgate, Cheshire, died earlier this month after having breathing difficulties.

She had been born prematurely at just 28 weeks and medics believed she would not survive any longer than 24 hours.

But she defied the odds, undergoing 200 operations during her short life and having to have a tracheotomy tube to help her breathe.

Eve's parents said their daughter had been a huge fan of the show for many years and that she would be 'giggling her head off' at the thought of Cumberbatch taking the time to write to her

Eve's parents said their daughter had been a huge fan of the show for many years and that she would be 'giggling her head off' at the thought of Cumberbatch taking the time to write to her.

Her father Mark, 47, said: 'Eve would find this funny as she was a big TV and film fan. She would be giggling her head off at the thought she was in the newspaper.

'But she would be so happy about the letter from Benedict - she was a huge fan.'  

I send my deepest sympathies to Eve's family. To lose someone so young who fought for her health all her life must be beyond endurance.

I hope they can take solace from the fact that she was clearly much loved and her support of our show is hugely appreciated and shall be remembered.

I wish I could be there but sadly am filming the show she loved.

God rest her soul.

With all my love and sympathies, Benedict xxx.

Her 46-year-old mother Jane, a full-time carer for Eve, described her daughter as 'unforgettable' and a self-confessed geek who dreamed of one day working in the media.

She said: 'She was individual. She did Eve's things and it didn't matter what you said to her she would still do Eve's things.

'She knew her own mind and it's a shame more kids don't feel strong enough and comfortable enough to be like Eve in that way.' 

She added that the service had been a celebration of Eve's short life and had included songs Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran, Blame It on Me by George Ezra, It's a Beautiful Day by Michael Bublé and Take me to Church by Hozier.

Hundreds attended the funeral, forcing church wardens to open the adjoining hall.

Her friend Danny Moores also made wristbands to raise money for Great Ormond Street, which dozens of mourners wore to the church.

On each wristband it read 'Eve - Gone but not forgotten'. 

Last year, Eve was able to have her tracheotomy tube removed for the first time.

Mr Shepherd said it had been a 'momentous occasion' but they knew it would not be 'a straight road.'

He said: 'It was always going to be one step forward two steps back but she always kept going.' 

Speaking about her birth, she said: 'The doctors kept her alive which was a miracle.

'If we are being honest they thought she was only going to live a day but she never gave up and we never gave up.'

The family requested no flowers but asked that  donations were instead made to the Peter Pan ward at Great Ormond Street, Alder Hey Bereavement team and Warrington Animal Welfare.
