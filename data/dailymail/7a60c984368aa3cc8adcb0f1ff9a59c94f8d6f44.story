Anti-capitalist protesters took over an empty office building owned by investment bank UBS last night.

It is the latest defiance from Occupy London protesters who announced yesterday they would legally challenge 24 hour eviction legal notices pinned to their tents outside St Paul's Cathedral.

A group of around 30 protesters got into the three storey office block in the heart of London's financial district with Occupy London taking responsibility on its website today.

Occupy UBS: Protestors today in the three-storey office block in London, they say taking over the building is part of 'public repossession'

The anti capitalist movement said it took over the abandoned office block in the neighborhood of 
Hackney in a 'public repossession' overnight.

Yesterday evening members of the group, stood in the 
windows looking down on Sun Street, the City of London, which is 
opposite another UBS building.

One, with his face covered, tied 
himself to a window frame with rope and sat on the ledge. When asked how
they got in, one of the protesters replied: 'Magic.'

Armed police and a police helicopter 
were at the scene of the occupation, which is close to a similar 
occupation in Finsbury Square.

Members of the group held a press conference on the ground floor with the press where they said they pledged they would be there round the clock.

They sat cross legged on the floor in front of a huge banner which read 'Occupy London'.

Speaking about why they were occupying the disused building, one demonstrator, who wished to be named as Franklyn, 36, said:

'UBS did gamble with pensioner's 
money and they lost a lot of money so there are some real issues that 
are global in terms of the economy.

'And it's the pensioners that are going to be hit the hardest.'

The group said they were due to hold 
the first national conference of the Occupy movement on Saturday from 
the site in Sun Street and promised more people would be joining them.

They told reporters they planned to use the space as a 'Bank of Ideas' to hold workshops and political discussions.

Asked whether they were worried about
eviction Pete Phoenix, 41, part of the Squatters Action Housing Group, 
said: 'We are not particularly worried.

'We are occupying the space at the moment and before the police come there would have to be a court case.

'We're here on behalf of the 
pensioners who lost money. We hope to talk to UBS and the police. We're 
very happy to negotiate and hope sense can be seen.'

Speaking about why they were 
occupying the disused building, a demonstrator who wished not to be 
named, said: 'When the UBS security guards were yelling at us we said we
would give it back if they gave back the billion dollars the stole from
pensioners.

He added: 'We've got more people joining us from the rest of the UK and Ireland tomorrow.'

You've been served: A bailiff pins an eviction notice to a tent outside St Paul's Cathedral

Time to leave: Bailiffs acting for the Corporation of London handed out eviction notices to the tents at the City Of London site

The City of London Corporation had 
told the protesters to move tents and equipment from the public highway 
by 6pm last night or face High Court action.

But
instead of packing up, protesters were discussing putting up Christmas 
decorations as they prepare for a lengthy legal battle.

Bailiffs had tied notes to some of the 200 tents pitched in the churchyard telling activists to leave or face High Court action.

But protesters vowed to continue and a sign on one of the tents yesterday declared: ‘Hell, no – we won’t go!’

The notice was issued a day after U.S. police cleared the Occupy Wall Street camp in New York. But lawyers warn the situation is more complex here due to human rights laws and the eviction could drag on for months.

The Corporation had halted earlier court action to hold talks with protesters. But policy chairman Stuart Fraser said the negotiations went ‘nowhere’.

Naomi Colvin, for Occupy London, insisted earlier this week the eviction ‘was not something we need to be remotely worried about’.

She added: ‘It could take months. We will contest it.’

Legal threat: The warning notice handed out to protesters

The Mail told last month how thermal imaging cameras showed the camp virtually empty at night. Even if the court action succeeds, the protest is likely be continue in the churchyard during the day as long as nobody pitches tents.

Adam Chapman, head of public law at Kingsley Napley, said the Human 
Rights Act would make evicting London protesters a far more complex 
affair.

Before deciding 
whether to give the go-ahead to the eviction, a judge would have to 
consider Article 10, which covers freedom of expression, and Article 11,
freedom of assembly, he said.

‘Any judgment would hinge on whether the interference with those rights is "proportionate".

Deadline passed: The anti-capitalist protesters did have the option of leaving voluntarily - but not one person has gone home

‘The
protesters have in their favour that St Paul’s remains open and so 
there is not a massive amount of disruption to the normal use of the 
land.

‘The Corporation of 
London also needs to decide if is just trying to remove the camp, or to 
stop the protest altogether, which would be much more difficult.

‘It is likely that we could get a 
situation where, even after the removal of the tents, protests are 
allowed to continue outside St Paul’s during the day.’

He said there were likely to be 
similarities with the attempts to evict the protesters camped in 
Parliament Square which began in May 2010 but only concluded ten months 
later in March this year.

On patrol: Police officers walk among protesters outside St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday

The anti-capitalist protest at the Cathedral is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy.

Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul’s since October 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed.

The City of London Corporation halted earlier court action to hold talks with protest organisers aimed at finding a compromise that would allow the demonstrators to remain at the site until January if they removed some of the tents.

After a humiliating 
internal row within the church which led to two high profile 
resignations, St Paul’s Cathedral decided not to join the legal action 
against the protesters.

A spokeswoman for St Paul’s said earlier this week: ‘We recognise the local authority’s statutory right to proceed with the action.

‘We
have always desired a peaceful resolution and the Canons will continue 
to hold regular meetings with representative of the protesters.’
