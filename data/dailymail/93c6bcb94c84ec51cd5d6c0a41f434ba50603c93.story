Breaking into a bookshop before sitting down to read a copy of Fly Fishing by J R Hartley can hardly be described as a typical Saturday night out.

But that’s what one drunk man ended up doing before he called the police to confess his crime.

Clive Crittenden had been out drinking in Tonbridge, Kent and was on his way home in the early hours with a kebab in hand when he broke into the Mr Books store.

Not your average Saturday night: Clive Crittenden broke into Mr Books in Tonbridge, Kent before he started reading a copy of Fly Fishing by JR Hartley

Shop owner Mark Richardson told the 
Kent and Sussex Courier that books were thrown around the shop, items 
swept off the counter and an antique bookslide and a wooden box 
containing small change smashed during the 3.30am incident.

The 50-year-old said: ‘The first I 
knew of it was about 9am on Sunday when I found answering machine 
messages from my landlord and the police.

‘My initial feeling was of shock and sheer horror and I was worried about what damage had been done.

‘It's fortunate that he hasn't damaged
any of the really valuable stuff as he must have been blundering round 
in the dark. It's just a mess, really.’

The shop owner said that books were thrown around the shop (interior pictured) and items swept off the counter during the incident

After stealing  some £1 coins, Crittenden settled down to read the book which was immortalised in the popular 1983
Yellow Pages TV advertisement.

Mr Richardson added: ‘He actually said to the police he was sitting in my shop reading Fly Fishing by JR Hartley.

‘I think they thought he was taking the mickey at first but there is actually a copy right by the phone.

‘It’s a book that I’ve had in the 
window before because it symbolises that I can get anything for you. His
choice of book adds to the bizarreness of the whole situation.

Crittenden sat reading the book with a kebab in hand. The title was named after the book in 1983 Yellow Pages advert (pictured)

‘I even think in a strange sort of way that might have brought him to his senses.’

The book was written by author 
Michael Russell under the pseudonym of JR Hartley to cash in on the 
success of the TV advertisement which shows an elderly man calling round
various bookshops looking for a copy of a ‘rather old’ book that he had
written years before.

He is told by all that the book is
not in stock and it is only when his daughter picks up a copy of Yellow
Pages that he tracks down a copy.

When the advertisement was aired, 
the book was purely fictional but in 1991, Mr Russell published Fly 
Fishing: Memories of Angling Days.

The advert (pictured) showed the fictional author JR Hartley trying to track down a copy of his book about fly fishing

After spending some time reading 
the book, while eating a kebab and drinking a bottle of water, 
Crittenden was ‘overcome with remorse’ and dialled 999 from the 
bookshop’s phone to confess the crime.

According to owner Mr Richardson, 
Crittenden told police that he was reading Fly Fishing by JR Hartley and 
that officers initially thought he was joking when he called at 4am.

He added: ‘The detective described
it as a one-off, what with him phoning to get himself arrested. It 
sounds funny after the event but it isn’t really funny at all.'

Crittenden admitted burglary at 
Sevenoaks JPs on Tuesday this week and was handed a one year community 
order and ordered to attend a course called Reducing Offending.
