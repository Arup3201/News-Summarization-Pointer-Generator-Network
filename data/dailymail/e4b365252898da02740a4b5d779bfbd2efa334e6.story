A man whose teen step-daughter was allegedly shot dead by three soldiers to protect an anti-government militia group rushed and yelled at one of the suspects as he appeared in court on Thursday.

Private Isaac Aguigui, Private Christopher Salmon and Sergeant Anthony Peden - all active-duty soldiers stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia - appeared separately in court as the District Attorney said he will seek the death penalty for each suspect.

Wesley Thomas, whose 17-year-old daughter Tiffany York was killed alongside her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, last year, bolted from his seat in the courtroom and rushed one of the suspects, Peden.

'You killed my kid!' he screamed before officers wrestled him to the floor, handcuffed him and led away, alongside Roark's father, Brett, who called one of the soldiers, 'Piece of (expletive).'

Swipe: Thomas was wrestled to the ground and led out of court - but was not charged for the outburst

Both men were led out of the courtroom, but neither was charged for the outburst.

Thomas, Salmon and Peden are each charged with 13 counts including malice murder, felony murder and illegal gang activity in the December 4 slayings.

The victims were shot in the head in the woods of rural Long County near Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia. Fishermen found their bodies the day after they were killed.

'I want them gone. I want all of these individuals to disappear,' said Nicholas Lee York, Tiffany's brother, who applauded the decision to seek death for the soldiers. 'They took something irreplaceable from me.'

Hate: As he tried to reach the defendant, Thomas yelled: 'You (expletive) killed my kid!'

Victims: Tiffany York, 17, and her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, were shot dead by three soldiers who wanted to protect their anti-government militia and their plans to assassinate the president

The case took a stunning turn at an 
earlier hearing Monday when prosecutors told a Superior Court judge the 
accused soldiers belonged to an anti-government militia operating within
the U.S. military that had stockpiled at least $87,000 worth of guns 
and bomb components.

They 
said the group had a range of plans - from bombing a park fountain in 
nearby Savannah to poisoning apple crops in the state of Washington - 
and its ultimate goal was to overthrow the U.S. government and 
assassinate the president.

President Barack Obama was not mentioned by name as their target.

Atlantic
Judicial Circuit District Attorney Tom Durden cites domestic terrorism 
as an aggravating factor that warrants the death penalty.

But
all charges against the soldiers relate directly to the killings. No 
charges have been filed in state or federal court accusing the three 
suspects of terrorist plots or acts.

'Sometimes some of these things don't
fit neatly into our state laws,' Durden said after court when asked 
about the absence of terrorism-related charges. "We're going forward 
with what we feel comfortable with."

Because
they now face capital charges, all three soldiers will need to have new
attorneys appointed with death penalty experience. They won't be 
arraigned or asked to enter pleas until that happens.

'At
this point, there has been no evidence presented to prove anything,' 
said Keith Higgins, an attorney who represented Aguigui in court 
Thursday. 'The fact that certain statements are being made does not 
necessarily mean these allegations are true.'

Salmon's
wife, Heather Salmon, has also been charged with murder and other 
counts. She did not appear in court Thursday and Durden said he will not
seek the death penalty for her.

Accused: Isaac Aguigui has also been accused of murder to cover up plans to bring down the government

In court: Christopher Salmon walks into court. The District Attorney said he will seek the death penalty for all three

Authorities
took extra precautions Thursday as the accused soldiers, in shackles 
and jailhouse jumpsuits, were brought before the judge for a preliminary
hearing.

The defendants were brought to the courthouse one-at-a-time, with their hearings scheduled an hour apart. Deputies armed with assault rifles walked in front of and behind them.

Relatives of both victims have been seething since Monday's hearing after a fourth soldier who says he witnessed both slayings testified about them in detail before pleading guilty to reduced charges.

Pfc. Michael Burnett told the judge Roark, whom prosecutors say was helping the militia buy guns, had just left the Army and was considered 'a loose end' by Aguigui, the militia's leader.

Burnett said Roark and his girlfriend were led to the woods. Peden shot York before she could get out of her car, Burnett testified, then paused to check her pulse and shot her again.

Roark was forced to kneel on the ground before Salmon shot him twice in the head, Burnett said.

The Army brought its own murder charges in the case in March, but dropped them earlier this month. Civilian federal prosecutors won't say if they're building a case.

Durden, the state prosecutor, says he doesn't know how many other members belonged to the militia, which prosecutors say was called F.E.A.R. - Forever Enduring Always Ready.

Army authorities have indicated they don't believe the suspects were part of a large group.

'We have one investigation that encompasses all the allegations made against these suspects,' said Chris Gray, spokesman for the Army's Criminal Investigations Command. 'We're not aware of any other subjects beyond this.'
