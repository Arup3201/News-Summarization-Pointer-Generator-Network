A time capsule was returned to a widower that was hidden in 1966 by his late wife hidden by a construction crew, bringing back a series of loving memories of their marriage.

Contractor John Murray, working with a construction crew on a North Phoenix four-bedroom home built in the 1950s, discovered the partially opened capsule.

'It was on the floor over there with a pile of insulation,' Murray told KPNX. 'Weâ€™ve done hundreds of houses but never found anything like this.'

Betty (in white) and Bruce (in jacket) are seen in this later photo of the Klug family. Describing his marriage to Betty, Bruce said 'We had the best marriage. Not once did we argue about anything'

Betty included this photo of herself and her two children in the time capsule

The capsule, hidden in 1966, was found partially opened

Inside the partially-opened capsule, there was a family photo and an open letter to future readers living in a different era.

The
 letter was written by 33-year-old Betty Klug, the station reports, and 
describes the social and political issues of the 1960s.

'The Vietnam War is still going on,' it reads. 'Racial situation very serious. Boys have long hair resulting from the Beatle craze.'

Another part reads 'Lyndon Johnson is president. We are hopeful that the Republicans will be in office when this time capsule is recovered.' 

'Barry Goldwater (Republican candidate for president) lives on top of the hill with the big T.V. antenna. (N.W. bedroom view.)'

Bruce Klug, Betty's husband, was found by the station living in Scottsdale and now 79 years old.

Klug did not know that his wife buried the time capsule -- and that the letter she included in it was written on his birthday.

Tragically, ten years after the capsule was hidden, Betty Klug died in a car crash.

Contractor John Murray, pictured, found the time capsule while working on the Klugs' former home in North Phoenix. He said he found the partially-opened capsule next to a pile of insulation

'I donâ€™t know how I did it â€” went back to work within a week,' Bruce told the station. 'We had the best marriage. Not once did we argue about anything.'

Bruce was thankful to revisit his memories of his wife and family. He laughed looking over notes his wife made about locations and places he recognized from the past.

'I enjoyed it, thanks,' he told Murray.

Murray, meanwhile, told the station he was happy to return the capsule to Bruce.

'It's been an awesome experience, for sure,' he said.
