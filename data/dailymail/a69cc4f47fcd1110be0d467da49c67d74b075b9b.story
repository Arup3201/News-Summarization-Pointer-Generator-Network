When you order a takeaway online you subconsciously select more food to feast on, major food retailers have revealed.

Perusing a menu from the comfort of the sofa on a touchscreen tablet or mobile phone encourages a hungry diner to order more food, compared to those ringing in their requests.

While on the phone, customers tend to stick their 'usual' order, when presented with a full and tempting menu online, appetisers, side orders, fizzy drinks and desserts creep in.

And retailers have noticed people are more likely to try new dishes they would never have thought about ordering.

In the U.S. a staggering 40 per cent of all Domino's orders are made online, the pizza chain revealed

Pizza chain Domino's has revealed a staggering 40 per cent of its U.S. sales come from orders made through desktop computers, smartphones and tablets.

And last week the firm introduced its new iPad app, designed to further boost sales.

Domino's spokesman Chris Brandon, told Co.Labs, that the major benefit from customers ordering online is the rise in extras and side orders.

'With Domino's before, you only needed to know a phone number and to think of your regular order or pizza order,' he said.

'Now that we have sandwiches, specialty pizzas, chicken, all these additional products and desserts, it increases sales.'

Mr Brandon said online orders also tend to be more accurate, with a smaller margin for mistakes, previously often the result of staff taking orders over the phone in noisy stores.

And that, he says, boosts customer satisfaction encouraging people to come back for more.

'There are 34 million ways to make a single Domino's pizza, and a lot of conditions can get lost in translation. Digital ordering can take care of a lot of that,' he added.

A further benefit for tech-savy food outlets is designing apps and features to entice younger customers.

The Domino Pizza Tracker and the chain's 3D modelling feature in the new iPad app helps retain a younger market.

And the information gathered by the firm through digital orders, allows the company to discover 'over-performing stores' that could be split in two and helps target specific areas based on ethnic eating habits.
