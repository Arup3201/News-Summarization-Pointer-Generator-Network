It has long been seen as a relaxed holiday destination where the sun shines on Krabi and 'Full Moon' parties fill the popular beaches of Phuket with happy revellers.

But the image of Thailand as an easy-going travel hotspot is under threat amid a growing number of cases of tourists being stopped and questioned by officials in Bangkok.

Overseas visitors exploring the country's exotic capital city have been increasingly complaining of harassment from police officers on the main avenue Sukhumvit Road.

Visible presence: Thailand has been under martial law since a military coup d'etat at the end of May

The Sydney Morning Herald has reported incidents of Australian tourists being pulled over at this busy heart of the city, and asked to show their passports.

Others have been subjected to random searches, being told to open their bags and take out their belongings – or even asked to submit a urine sample for drugs tests.

Disturbingly, there are reported cases of travellers being given on-the-spot fines that have to be paid immediately, and in cash.

The Bangkok Post also reported the concerns of one unnamed tourist who witnessed the random search policy at first hand.

At the heart of the matter: Sukhumvit Road is the key artery in the middle of the Thai capital Bangkok

'They were thoroughly searching tourists and their belongings, asking them to produce passports,' the unidentified traveller said.

'Many of these unfortunate souls were then detained, and I saw them paying money to officials. One girl was reduced to tears and was very obviously upset.'

The reports add to fears that Thailand is becoming a less hospitable country for tourists.

The country is currently under martial law in the wake of a coup d'etat which saw the military take control of the government last May.

The takeover was preceded by a wave of protests and demonstrations, particularly in Bangkok, which has been a regular scene of upheaval in the last five years.

In November, Paiboon Koomchaya, the current Thai Justice Minister, announced that martial law could stay in place indefinitely.

Martial law gives the Thai officials wide-scale powers, including the right to stop and search.

'We are not saying that martial law will stay in place for 50 years,' said General Paiboon. 'No, this is not it. We just ask that it remain in place for now, indefinitely.'

'Am I happy? No, I'm not,' he continued. The longer [martial law] is in place, the more unhappy I become. Yet, it's necessary.

'Today, priority must be given to the future of the country. Conflict and social disparity must be stopped.'

The issue of travellers being targetted by police has not escaped the attention of British officials.

Mark Kent, the British ambassador in Thailand, tweeted last week that he has raised the issue with the tourism authorities in Bangkok.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises British tourists to take care in Thailand.

'Martial law is in place and provides an enabling framework for the Royal Thai Army to take action it deems necessary to enforce law and order,' it explains.

'Before the military coup, there were large-scale demonstrations and protests in Bangkok and other cities. You should avoid any political gatherings, demonstrations or marches.'

Potential visitors are also warned that freedom of speech is very much constrained in Thailand under the current regime.

'A number of media outlets have been taken off air and some internet sites remain blocked,' the advice continues.

'It is illegal to criticise the coup, and you should be wary of making political statements in public. You should monitor local news and social media for developments.

'Before travelling to Thailand, check with your insurance provider that they will continue to cover for claims arising from the current political situation.

'Some travel insurance policies exclude cover following a military coup or the imposition of martial law, and your insurance may be invalid.'
