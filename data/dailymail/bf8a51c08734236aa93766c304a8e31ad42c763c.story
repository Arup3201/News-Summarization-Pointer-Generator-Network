It was finally something for the Miami Heat to celebrate after a difficult year and provided everyone with a brief respite from the NBA lockout.

Basketball star Chris Bosh, 27, held a lavish three-day wedding party costing an estimated $300,000 with his petite princess Adrienne Williams.

The couple celebrated with 300 guests in Miami Beach, Florida, including Heat players LeBron James, Juwan Howard and Dwyane Wade - despite the lockout.

Also in attendance were Heat manager Pat Riley, coach Erik Spoelstra and vice-president Nick Arison, reported the New York Post.

The NBA gave them special permission to attend, despite the lockout forbidding any contact between players and executives.

The wedding was held at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach and gave a rare sight during the lockout of Heat players partying with team executives.

One
guest told the New York Post that the players and executives were on 
either side of the ballroom and they later met on the dance floor.

The lockout began at the start of July but it was paused for a Latin-themed party on Friday and a lavish ceremony on Saturday.

Tall story: Bosh, who stands at a huge 6ft 10in, married his 5ft bride Adrienne, and gifts exchanged between the couple included a Cartier necklace for Adrienne and an Aston Martin for Bosh

Guests including tennis star Serena Williams, actress Gabrielle Anwar and publisher Jason Binn were there, reported the New York Post.

Bosh, who stands at a huge 6ft 10in, married his 5ft bride Adrienne as she wore an Oscar de la Renta gown and Christian Louboutin heels.

Gifts exchanged between the couple included a Cartier necklace for Adrienne and an Aston Martin for Bosh.

The couple actually legally married towards the end of the NBA season. Their first dance at the celebration party was to ‘Wonderful Tonight’ by Eric Clapton.

Around 100 guests then partied at the Arkadia club until 5am before having a Sunday brunch at Scarpetta, reported the New York Post.

Miami Heat were beaten in the NBA play-off finals this year by the Dallas Mavericks.
