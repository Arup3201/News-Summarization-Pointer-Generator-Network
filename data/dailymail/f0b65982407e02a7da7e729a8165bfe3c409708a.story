Like many clubs who call themselves 'The Eagles' - including Crystal Palace, Benfica and Lazio - Club America fly a bird of prey around their stadium before games.

It's a tradition at the club that features at half-time of every home game played at the Estadio Azteca. 

However, the Mexican side have now taken the spectacle a step further by attaching a GoPro camera to their resident eagle named Celeste to give a stunning bird's eye view of their stadium before a game against Pumas UNAM (who thankfully did not release their own animal).

Watch your heads! The eagle takes off surprisingly close to fans at the rear of the stadium

Spectacle: The eagle mascot completes a couple of loops in the air to impress Club America fans

Touchdown! The bird of prey eventually lands on its trainer's arm at the centre of the pitch

The eagle soars astonishingly close to supporters heads after taking off from the rear of the stands and performing a couple of loops before landing on its trainer's arm at the centre of the pitch. 

Unfortunately for Club America, Celeste did not bring them any luck as the Pumas inflicted a first loss on the home team in this season's Liga MX with a 1-0 victory.

Crystal Palace also have an live mascot, a bald named Kayla, who flies around Selhurst Park before most home games - although it was once berated by Millwall fans for being 'just a pigeon'

Let it begin: Benfica are another club who start home games with the ritual flying of a bird of prey
