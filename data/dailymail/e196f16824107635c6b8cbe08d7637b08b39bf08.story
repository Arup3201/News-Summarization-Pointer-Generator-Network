The meaning behind a 'moo' may have been solved by scientists, who have recorded and analysed the way cows communicate.

British researchers found cows make two very distinct calls when they talk to their calves, depending on the distance between them.

They also identified a specific call a calf makes to its mother when its wants to start suckling.

Cows and their calves communicate using calls that are individualised in a similar way to human names. The team studied two herds of free-range cattle on a farm in Nottinghamshire. Recordings were made using highly sensitive audio equipment

The team spent 10 months studying the ways cows talked to their young to discover cows make maternal low sounds when a mother is close to her calf.

The louder, higher pitched calls are reserved for when a calf is out of visual contact. Meanwhile, calves make a specific call when they want milk. 

But, the most important finding was that all three calls were individualised  in a similar way to human names.

Lead scientist Dr Monica Padilla de la Torre, from the University of Nottingham, said: 'The research shows for the first time that mother-offspring cattle 'calls' are individualised - each calf and cow have a characteristic and exclusive call of their own.

'Acoustic analysis also reveals that certain information is conveyed within the calf calls - age, but not gender.'

The team studied two herds of free-range cattle on a farm in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire.

Recordings were made using highly sensitive equipment that gathered enough data to study for a year.

Low frequency calls - These are produced by cows when they are close to their calves, usually a few weeks after birth.

Louder high frequency calls - The louder calls are made when cows are separated from their calves, after nursing, and not in visual contact.

Calf calls - These calls are created when calves are separated from their mothers and want to suckle milk.

Further work may reveal vocal indicators of well-being or distress in cows which could influence animal care policies, say the researchers

Co-author Dr Alan McElligott, from Queen Mary University of London, said: 'This is the first time that complex cattle calls have been analysed using the latest and best techniques.

'Our results provide an excellent foundation for investigating vocal indicators of cattle welfare.'

Farmer James Bourne, who has been around cows since the 1950s, told the BBC that the research supports what he has always noticed himself.

'A calf certainly knows its mother from other cows, and when a calf [calls] the mother knows it's her calf,' said Mr Bourne, who is a farmer in Lincolnshire.

'If they are not distressed, and they are calm, they will moo fairly low to the calf, almost talking to their calf.'
