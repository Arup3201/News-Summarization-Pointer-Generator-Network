Mohammad Nazri Abdul Aziz, Minister of Tourism and Culture, said the government will not put 'any more money' into the troubled airline

The Malaysian tourism minister has said the government will not inject any more money into the state-owned Malaysian Airlines after the MH370 disaster.

The ailing national carrier has suffered a slump in bookings and £750 million losses following the disappearance of the flight two months ago and is undergoing 'restructuring'.

Mohammad Nazri Abdul Aziz, Minister of Tourism and Culture, said the government will not put 'any more money' into the troubled airline.

Malaysia Airlines - which is owned by the government through a holding company - had already suffered $1.3billion losses over the past three years as it faced stiff competition and unprofitable routes, Gulf News reports.

Mr Aziz said that the government is now unsure what it can do - but he added: 'To inject new capital is certainly not an option.'

It now looks unlikely that the government will sell the national carrier to private investor after the share price dropped both under the restructuring plans and the flight MH370 disaster.

Aziz - speaking at the Arabian Travel Market to plug the tourism industry in Malaysia - also revealed that there has been a 30 per cent in drop off in tourism numbers from 
China in the past two months.

Most of those onboard the missing flight were from China.

Experts
 have narrowed the area where the plane is presumed to have crashed to a
 large arc of the Indian Ocean about 1,600 km (1,000 miles) northwest of
 the city of Perth in western Australia.

The
 aircraft could have flown for up to seven hours after it went missing, 
meaning that even if the cockpit recorder is found, its standard 
two-hour recording loop would not cover conversations during the crucial
 early stages of the flight.

It comes after an international panel of experts announced they are to re-examine all of the data gathered in the hunt for the missing flight to ensure search crews have been looking 
in the right place.

Government
 officials from Australia, China and Malaysia yesterday pledged not to give 
up searching for the aircraft that disappeared almost two months ago.

They
 met in the Australian capital to discuss the next step in the search 
for the missing flight, which will centre around an expanded patch of 
seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia.

The area became the focus of the hunt 
after a team of analysts calculated the plane's likeliest flight path 
based on satellite and radar data.

Starting
 Wednesday, that data will be re-analyzed and combined with all 
information gathered so far in the search, which has not turned up a 
single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million 
square kilometers (1.8 million square miles) of ocean.

'We've
 got to this stage of the process where it's very sensible to go back 
and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered, all of the 
analysis that has been done and make sure there's no flaws in it, the 
assumptions are right, the analysis is right and the deductions and 
conclusions are right,' Angus Houston, head of the search operation, 
told reporters in Canberra.

Investigators
 have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on 
March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A weeklong search 
for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined 
any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk.

'Unfortunately,
 all of that effort has found nothing,' Australian Transport Minister 
Warren Truss said. 'We've been confident on the basis of the information
 provided that the search area was the right one, but in practice, that 
confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the 
aircraft.'

Houston has warned the underwater search is likely to continue for up to a year.

European safety officials have today put forward tougher rules for 'black box' flight recorders in the 
strongest regulatory reaction yet to the disappearance of Malaysia 
Airlines flight MH370.

The 
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it would propose increasing 
the recording time on cockpit voice recorders to 20 hours from two to 
make it easier to understand plane accidents and prevent vital evidence 
being overwritten.

Newly 
published proposals would also bring into force recommendations made by 
French crash investigators after the loss of an Air France jet in the 
Atlantic in 2009, but which remain bogged down in talks among 
regulators.

These include 
the addition of a new pinger frequency making it easier to locate the 
recording devices under water, where lower frequencies travel further.

The proposals appeared in an opinion published by EASA on Tuesday.

They have been submitted to the European Union's executive Commission which will use them as the basis for a change in law.

'The
 proposed changes are expected to increase safety by facilitating the 
recovery of information by safety investigation authorities,' EASA 
Executive Director Patrick Ky said in a statement.

EASA
 also brought forward to 2018 a deadline for extending the battery life 
on black box emergency locator beacons to 90 days from 30.

All
 passenger aircraft have two flight recorders - one for voice and one 
for data. Each is equipped with a beacon designed to start emitting 
signals as soon as it enters water.

The
 extended battery life is so far the only recommendation from the three 
year-investigation into the Air France disaster to have won full support
 at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a U.N. agency 
that coordinates safety standards.

ICAO
 agreed to back the battery life change from 2018 but EASA originally 
gave European operators another year until 2019. (Editing by Laurence
