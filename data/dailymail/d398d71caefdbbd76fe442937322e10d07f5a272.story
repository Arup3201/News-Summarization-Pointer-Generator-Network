A cheating husband who smashed his wife's head into a cabinet has been jailed.

Muhammed Khalil, 38, then asked his mistress to lie for him to police saying that he was actually the victim of abuse.

However, he was jailed yesterday for 15 months for the brutal assault that left Biklis Parveen, 33, with a serious head injury.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that the former probation officer flew into a rage and attacked his wife when she refused to let him take their two children away from the family home in October.

He slapped her across the face then rammed her head into the furniture.

Khalil then fled their home in Hall Green, Birmingham, before starting to weave his web of lies.

His new lover, Anarkali Habib, 34, told police she saw him being attacked by his wife when she was driving past their house.

She claimed she was driving past their house when she saw Mrs Parveen attacking Khalil and handed him her mobile phone to call police.

However, a jury found Khalil guilty of assault after hearing the pair had been having an affair.

Khalil was jailed for 15 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday after also pleading guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Passing sentence, Judge Simon Drew said only the fact that Habib 'cracked under pressure' stopped Mrs Parveen being wrongly arrested.

He told Khalil: 'You did not cause your former wife to be arrested and prosecuted.

'That was because the witness you had set up cracked under the pressure rather than anything you did yourself.'

The judge added that Khalil's crimes went to the 'heart of the judicial system'.

During his trial prosecutor Graeme Simpson told the court Khalil flew into a rage when he tried to take his two children, two and four, away from his wife. 

Mr Simpson said: 'He swore at her and slapped her across the face three or four times before pushing her against furniture in the hallway, where she received a nasty cut above her eye.

'In interview Mr Khalil initially told police that he did not know the woman (Habib) and had never met her.

'When officers told him later that they had been provided with the same mobile telephone number by his wife who had been told about a witness from York, he admitted concocting the cock and bull story.'

Habib, from York, had previously admitted one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice with their web of lies.

She was handed a three-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, in December last year.

Mrs Parveen told the court she had found out her husband had been cheating on her after she discovered Habib's number on his mobile phone.

She told the court: 'I had found out that he had been having an affair and had forgiven him. 

'He came back for four days and then left again. 

'He turned up again and said he wanted to take the kids.'

Mohammed Rashid, defending Khalil, said he lost his temper as he tried to sort out arrangements regarding his children with his wife.

Mr Rashid said: 'It is quite clear he panicked when he phoned up his friend.'
