A surprise decision to remove a cap on the Swiss franc sent markets into fresh turmoil today but helped the pound climb to a near-seven year high against the euro.

The strength of sterling will help UK holidaymakers visiting the likes of Spain, Greece and France this year, but is not good for skiers heading to the Swiss Alps.

It could also spell trouble for British firms whose goods have become more expensive for potential export customers on the continent.

There were fears it could also leave a nasty taste in the mouth for chocolate lovers ahead of Easter as it could mean a price hike for the country's confectionery products.

Currency shock: The Swiss central bank's move has seen the Swiss franc soar against all major currencies

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'Switzerland suddenly got a whole lot more expensive and for chocolate lovers Nestle and/or Lindt chocolate just got a whole lot more expensive.' 

The decision by Switzerland's central bank to drop the policy capping the franc's value at no more than 1.20 euros comes a day after stocks were buffeted by a slump in the copper price, adding to ongoing anxiety about the plunge in oil.

It helped sterling rise sharply against the single currency, topping the 1.30 euros mark to a level not seen since March 2008 - an increase of ten cents in the last year. 

The euro initially plunged by 30% against the Swiss currency before paring the loss to 13% later in the morning. Sterling was also down sharply against the franc, falling by as much as 26% in value before partially recovering to be 14% off later.

The move by the Swiss central bank could see a rise the price of Swiss chocolates, like Lindt bunnies, in the coming months, experts have said

In shares, the FTSE 100 Index had a turbulent session, initially adding more than 80 points as it recovered from a copper-inspired plunge in the previous session, before falling to 90 points off its opening position, then returning to positive territory. 

Switzerland's central bank had introduced the cap on the franc in September 2011 to try to hold back the rise of the safe haven currency at a time when the eurozone debt crisis was at its height.

Swiss exporters had at the time been forced to sharply cut prices to stay competitive. But the bank today said the policy, while having protected the economy from harm, could no longer be justified.

The slide in the euro in recent months against the dollar has meant that because of the peg the franc has fallen too. 

Despite its strengthening currency, the Swiss stock index slumped 9% amid fears that exports will become more expensive in the wake of the decision to end the peg.

Swiss-listed shares in offshore drilling contractor Transocean slumped to an all-time low, while lenders Julius Baer and UBS were down 13 percent and 11 percent respectively.

Weaker equities wiped off about 117 billion Swiss francs ($100 billion) from the SMI share index.

'It is carnage, they've stopped defending the floor, I'm a seller of Europe here,' said Darren Courtney-Cook, head of trading at Central Markets Investment Management.

Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek called the SNB's decision 'a tsunami' for Switzerland's economy. 

The cap has come under increasing pressure as the franc's value elsewhere has soared with investors seeking a haven in Switzerland from the eurozone's economic and political troubles.

Recovery: The pound has gained steadily against the euro over the last eighteen months.

The SNB has until now resisted pressure to let the franc float against the euro but the prospect of outright money-printing - which devalues a currency - by the European Central Bank as early as next week broke the bank's resolve.

'It has taken the market by complete surprise,' said Jonathan Webb, head of FX strategy at Jefferies in London.

'The SNB probably expects the ECB to launch QE next week and along with the Greek elections coming up, it would make it pretty tough on the Swiss to keep bidding the euro.'

Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets added: 'The SNB must have a very strong inclination that the European Central Bank is about to begin a large scale quantitative easing program which would act to depreciate the euro and make a defence of the Swiss franc peg impossible.'

Europe's shares and bond yields tumbling as jittery markets reacted negatively to the unexpected move. The FTSE 100 index fell 100 points on the news, dropping from 60 points up on the day to 40 points down at 6,347.

The dollar meanwhile also lost 14 per cent of its value against the Swiss franc.

'This is extremely violent and totally unexpected, the central bank didn't prepare the market for it,' said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG in France.

'It's sparking panic across all asset classes. It suddenly revives the risk of central bank policy mistakes, right when central bank action is what's keeping equity markets going.' 

The currency moves overshadowed a steadier session for commodity stocks after a sharp slide in the price of copper triggered big losses across Europe's leading stock markets on Wednesday.

Hargreaves Lansdown estimates that UK fund investors have more than £4billion invested in Swiss stocks, mainly via European funds, but also perhaps more surprisingly, via UK Equity Income funds.

The fund platform said Swiss drugmakers Roche and Novartis are popular fund holdings with managers in the UK Equity Income sector, who can invest up to 20 per cent of their portfolio overseas. For instance, it noted that Woodford Equity income has 3 per cent invested in Roche.

Hargreaves estimates that the average European fund has 9 per cent invested in Swiss stocks, the typical European (ex-UK) tracker fund has around 20 per cent, and the average UK Equity Income fund has just under 1 per cent, though some UK Equity Income funds have closer to 5 per cent invested.

However, even though the Swiss stock market has tanked today, the financial services group believes that the effect of the sharp rise in the Swiss franc has more than offset that fall.

After factoring in the currency's rise against the pound, Hargreaves thanks that UK investors would on average have made around 2 per cent on their Swiss stock market holdings this morning.

And UK Equity Income funds invested in Roche and Novartis would have made more, both these stocks rose about 5 per cent in sterling terms. Not bad for a morning's work.

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: 'The Swiss stock market has been decimated this morning by the central bank's decision to remove their currency peg to the Euro. However UK investors can afford a wry smile because the appreciation of the franc has made their Swiss holdings more valuable, despite the stock market plunge.'
