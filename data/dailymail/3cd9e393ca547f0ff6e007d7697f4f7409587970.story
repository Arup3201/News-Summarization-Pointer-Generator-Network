Michelle Obama insisted on a pricey holiday to Hawaii when her husband would have rather gone to a presidential retreat, according to reports.

She allegedly wanted the taxpayer-funded $4million trip when Barack Obama sought instead to make the short trip to Camp David in Maryland.

Political sources told the National Enquirer that the 47-year-old’s spending is rocketing and she even went on a shopping spree before the Hawaii trip.

‘The President’s advisers have told him that Michelle’s spending has spiralled “completely out of control”,’ one source told the National Enquirer.

‘Barack read his wife the riot act, but his words fell on deaf ears. Michelle said there was “no way” she was going to disappoint her daughters.’

The First Family has already attracted criticism as their annual vacation in Hawaii this year is likely to be their most expensive ever.

The President will travel separately from his family this time because he wanted resolve the payroll tax cut issue before leaving Washington D.C.

Mrs Obama took Malia and Sasha to MA'O Organic Farms in Hawaii for pizza earlier this week where they were joined by healthy eating advisors.

Mr Obama himself was seen buying pizzas from the Del Ray Pizzeria back in Alexandria as he spends time at home without his family.

Mrs Obama took the children last weekend in a flight that cost an extra $100,000 - and her husband’s round-trip journey will be $3,271,611.

The bill for the trip went up last week when Mrs Obama decided to take Sasha and Malia herself while her husband tries to save the U.S. economy.

His flight was estimated by the Hawaii Reporter as the largest expense of the holiday trip, which will cost more than $4million in total.

But his family is covering the cost of a private beach front residence in Kailua, Oahu, which costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month.

It is not yet known exactly when President Obama will fly out to Hawaii, with the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Il likely delaying his trip further.
