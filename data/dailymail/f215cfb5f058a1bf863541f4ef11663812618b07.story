Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will try to kickstart his club’s season without new signings Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera at Sunderland on Sunday.

United need a victory at the Stadium of Light to lift the gloom surrounding the club after the 2-1 home defeat by Swansea City on the opening day of the Barclays Premier League season.

New Arrival: Speaking for the first time since his unveiling as a United player, Rojo said he was excited to join

But it emerged last night that Argentina international Rojo has not yet had his work permit granted after his midweek £16million move from Sporting Lisbon and Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera suffered an ankle injury in training.

‘We have seven injuries, which is a lot,’ Van Gaal said: ‘In my career as a trainer, I have never had seven injuries before. Last game it was nine, so we are progressing.

‘I have four midfielders missing: Herrera, (Marouane) Fellaini, (Jesse) Lingard and (Michael) Carrick. So it’s a little bit thin in midfield.

‘Herrera (was hurt) yesterday in training but it is too early to make a scan. Rojo is fit, but we still have to arrange the work permit.’

Ready: The Argentina defender can play on the left or in the centre, but is not eligible to start on Sunday

Patient: United fans will have to wait a little longer to get their first sight of Rojo in action for the club

Rojo’s paperwork will be a formality, given that he is a full Argentina international. He may now make his debut at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday.

Van Gaal, meanwhile, warns United’s fans not to expect the Premier League title this season. ‘It is not a question of being champion,’ he said. ‘We have to build a team, and that process takes maybe longer.

‘The fans need to believe, like chief executive Ed Woodward and the Glazers, because we need the fans.

‘It was amazing after our loss against Swansea, that the fans were applauding me. I never had that experience before — nowhere.’
