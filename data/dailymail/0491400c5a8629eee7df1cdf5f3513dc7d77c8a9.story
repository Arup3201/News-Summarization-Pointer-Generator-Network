German side FC St. Pauli certainly need a boost ahead of the second-half of the season and may want to move defensive midfielder Julian Koch into a more attacking role.

The 24-year-old, on loan from Bundesliga outfit Mainz, fired in an outrageous long range strike after just five seconds during a friendly against Swiss second division side FC Winterthur during a training camp in Belek.

Koch was the sharpest as the match began and stole the ball to take a look up and fire his half-way line shot past an unsuspecting keeper.

Luckily for Koch the officials missed the German encroaching on the centre circle before FC Winterthur had started play and went on to be a crucial goal as they prevailed 2-0.

FC St. Pauli are currently languishing 17th in Bundesliga 2, just two points off the foot of the table and will hope their training camp during the German football winter break can inspire them up the table.

Meanwhile Koch, a former Borussia Dortmund youth player, will aim to fire in more spectacular strikes like this to reignite his career at St. Pauli, having represented his country at numerous age groups up to Under 21.
