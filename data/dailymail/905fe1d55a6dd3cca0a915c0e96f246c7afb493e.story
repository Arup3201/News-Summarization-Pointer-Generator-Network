The mom of an honor roll student in Pasco County, Florida who was viciously attacked on a school bus has spoken of her relief that her daughter's attacker has been brought to justice.

Chase Cristia, 16, a student at Mitchell High School was attacked in February and video footage of the sickening incident was quickly posted on Facebook.

‘That's what you get for talking s**t, b***h!’ the attacker yelled as the beating finally stopped.

No mercy: The unnamed 17-year old girl approaches Chase and then repeatedly punches her on the back of the head and neck

On Thursday, the 17-year-old attacker who hasn't been named because she is a juvenile pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge.

Circuit Judge Shawn Crane called the girl's conduct ‘outrageous’ and sentenced her to 270 days of probation, with conditions. 

The mother of the victim, Tracy Cristia, said the judge’s sentencing felt like a weight lifted off the family’s shoulders.

'So many sleepless nights,' she told Bay News 9, describing how life changed for her 
daughter after the attack. 'Emergency room visits, stomach aches, 
nightmares.'

Victim Chase Cristia, 16, was too shy to speak in court but had a statement read out in which she said her attacker deserved to be punished

The perpetrator has received 270 days of probation, with conditions for the unprovoked attack

During the brief but brutal beating the 
17-year old girl approached Chase at the back of the bus, 
grabbed her and then repeatedly punched her in the back of the head and 
neck at least 10 times. 

Victim Chase wrote a statement about what happened, but she was too shy to read it in court.
The prosecutor read it for her.

‘With
the love and support from my family and friends I will overcome,’ she 
wrote, ‘but I believe these girls should be held accountable for their 
poor decisions.

'Not only did they plan and execute this attack on me, 
but they were proud of what they did and bragged about it. I believe 
they should be punished and made to learn a lesson from this.’

Watching video of the incident in court, Judge Crane said the attacker was out of control.

‘There's
no excuse for it. Absolutely no excuse,’ the judge said. ‘There is no 
provocation for that to occur on a school bus, in our community. It's 
supposed to be safe. We put our children on buses so they can travel 
safely to school. They shouldn't be attacked, right?’

Under the conditions of her probation, the attacker must keep a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and is not allowed to use social media

‘Yes, sir,’ the attacker said.

Under the conditions of her probation she must keep a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., write a letter of 
apology to both Cristia and her own mother, and complete mental and 
substance abuse evaluations.

She must also have random urine tests and is not allowed to use social media.

She 
also was ordered to pay restitution to Cristia, mainly for medical 
expenses, at a tentative amount of $40 a month, for a total of more than
$2,000.

‘She acknowledges her conduct,’ public defender Phil Cohen said. ‘She's not proud of it.’

The girl who filmed the attack and posted it on Facebook is expected to face the judge in September.
