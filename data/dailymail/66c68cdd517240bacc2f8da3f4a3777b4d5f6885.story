When actress Kelli Maybank took her final bow at the end of the pantomime Sleeping Beauty, she thought all the surprises were over.

But little did she know, her boyfriend had been nervously waiting backstage so he could come on and propose to her in front of the audience after the final bow.

Kelli, 29, is playing Prince Percival of Percatania in the production at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham.

Boyfriend of 10 years, Mark Grunsell, unexpectedly appeared on stage with flowers and a diamond ring

She was on stage with the rest of the cast taking their final bow when Mark Grunsell appeared with a bouquet of flowers - and a diamond engagement ring.

Mark popped the question and the audience burst into cheers and applause when Kelly said yes.

Afterwards, still in her tricorn hat and thigh high golden boots, Kelli, said: 'I was a bit shocked. My heart was pounding when I saw him. I thought, Oh God, here we go.'

'I knew I was going to say yes.

'I wanted to cry, but I had to hold it together, because I was in costume.

'I didn't have a clue he was planning this.

Kelli admits: 'I was a bit shocked. I knew I was going to say yes. I didn't have a clue he was planning this.'

Mark planned the romantic proposal with the help of Kelli's best friend, Laura, who was on hand that night

Kelli reveals that although they'd been together for a decade, she didn't push for a proposal

'I couldn't kiss him properly though, because my hat was stuck firmly onto my head so it didn't come off during the show.'

The couple, who met through friends, and conducted their relationship long distance for three years, are planning to get married in 2016 in the church used previously by members of her family.

Kelli added: 'We've been together for nearly 10 years. At around eight years in, I did wonder when he would propose, but I was never one of those girlfriends to force things.'

All of Kelli's closest friends and family were in the audience for her - very fitting - fairytale proposal

Mark opted to propose to Kelly (second from right) on stage because he didn't want to do anything obvious

Mark arranged for Kelli's close family and friends to be in the audience for the big deed, after clearing it with the Everyman Theatre.

Self-confessed unromantic Mark, 33, who runs a delivery franchise, said he decided to propose on stage because he didn't want to do anything obvious.

He said: 'We've been together a long time and it seemed like a fun way to propose, as life with Kelli is always a drama.

'It was easier to do this than to do it at a table in a restaurant. I would feel awkward doing that.

'[On stage] seemed like a fun way to propose,' Mark explained. 'Life with Kelli is always a drama.'

Following Mark's impromptu proposal, the pair returned to their native Dorset for an engagement party

'I couldn't have done it without the help of Kelli's best friend, Laura.

'I did check, through Laura and Kelli's family, how likely she was to say yes. I had a quick second thought when that was brought up.'

The couple, who have two Yorkshire terriers, named Poppy and Daisy, have been celebrating ever since; guzzling champagne at the theatre on Saturday and returning to their native Christchurch in Dorset for an engagement party.

The director of the pantomime, Phil Clark said: ' At last fantasy meets reality! Whoever said fairytale endings don't come true? Anything can happen in panto! 

'There was a massive cheer from the audience when Kelli said yes and not a dry eye in the house!'
