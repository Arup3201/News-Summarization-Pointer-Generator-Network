Paul Bodger, 51, was astonished to see that the 'stone' he had dug up with his JCB was in fact his missing tortoise, Sydney

A tortoise that went missing ten months ago has been found alive - after his owner dug up his garden to build a house extension.

Paul Bodger had assumed his pet would never be seen again after he went missing from his Cambridgeshire home last June.

But when Mr Bodger began digging up his garden to add an extension to his house, they found a tortoise-shaped, mud-covered lump in the soil.

Mr Bodger, 51, said: 'We started digging up the land for the foundations of our extension and I was spraying some pesticide on it when I ended up spraying Sydney.

'At first I thought he was a stone - he was absolutely caked in mud.'

Sydney, who is five and had been a present to Mr White from his 46-year-old wife in 2011, was last seen in June before he disappeared overnight.

Mr Bodger, a blacksmith, and his partner Yvette White, 46, spent a fortnight looking for their the Horse Field tortoise, even calling in a gun dog to see if it could sniff the tortoise out.

But when they still could not find Sydney, which Miss White had given her boyfriend as a present in 2011, they assumed he had wandered off for ever.

Mr Bodger said: 'He's normally kept in about a 25 or 26 degree controlled environment, in a heated vivarium, and we never let him hibernate.

'So when he got out last June there is every chance he mistook the cool summer for winter and burrowed his way underground.

'That would explain why we couldn't 
find him.'

Happy to be free: Sydney looked as good as new after a wash and a check-up from the vet

Three weeks ago they began digging up their garden so they could lay the foundations for the four-bedroom extension to their home in Wisbech.

They dug five feet down with a JCB, and it was in this earth that Sydney was found.Â  When Mr Bodger realised the mud-covered object was his pet, he initially assumed he must have died.

Mr Bodger believes his pet might have struggled to dig himself free without the JCB digging him out.

He said: 'I'm amazed how long he has managed to survive for. And I can't believe he survived being dug up by the digger.

After 10 months burrowed deep in the chilly Cambridgeshire soil, Sydney is back in his heated vivarium

'It's a miracle, I suppose. Yvette is over the moon but she is working in London so still hasn't seen him. She is absolutely delighted now.'

Mr Bodger has now washed Sydney and returned him to his heated vivarium after his extended winter.

He has been checked over by a vet and given the all-clear.

Tortoises are known to bury themselves just under the surface of the earth as part of their hibernation pattern.
