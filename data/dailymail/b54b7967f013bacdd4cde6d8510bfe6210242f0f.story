Diet disaster: Yet Faye Campbell's still slim - AND healthy

With her clear skin, supermodel-long legs and slim figure, Faye Campbell looks like she knows how to look after herself. Such a physique, one assumes, must be down to a disciplined regime of exercise coupled with a restricted and controlled diet.

And, yes, certainly, one of those points is true: Faye's diet is indeed restrictive, but not in the way you'd expect. Lunch is always tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburger and chips, and dinner is, again, tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburger and chips.

And that is it. No fruit, vegetables, fresh meat or fish. Just processed, salty and fatty rubbish, day after day, all washed down with litres of sugar-packed Lucozade or cola.

Very occasionally, she'll deviate and 
have a Chinese takeaway of noodles with sweet and sour sauce, and she's 
recently discovered a liking for breaded mozzarella sticks, but mostly 
she sticks to tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburgers and chips.

When
 her story broke in the Mail last month — in which Faye described 
herself as a junk food addict — it led to the obvious question: what on 
earth must she be doing to her health? Surely, as commentators pointed 
out at the time, this ostensibly fit and strong body must be masking a 
host of medical horrors within, which were fast catching up with her.

This
 was a question Faye — who, incidentally, does absolutely no exercise 
and up until two months ago smoked up to 20 cigarettes a day — herself 
had often pondered, with understandable trepidation.

Only
 after meeting Faye, and putting her through a raft of medical tests, is
 the true conundrum of her size 10-12 figure revealed. I can confirm she
 is a medical oddity.

We 
meet over lunch, where I observe Faye bolting down a double cheeseburger
 (she specifies no salad or gherkins), large chips and a Coke at 
McDonalds. I venture the obvious suggestion that Faye's terrible eating 
habits must have started at home.

She insists, vehemently, they didn't.

'The thing that upsets my mum the most
 is when people assume this was how she raised me,' says Faye, who works
 as a carer at a local residential home and still lives with parents 
Carolyn, 43, an administrator, and father Mark, 45, a lorry driver.

'She hates me eating like this and she tried so hard to get me to eat healthily as a child.'

Her
 family — which includes sisters Lauren, 23, and Tilly, 19 — are very 
close and Faye explains that sitting down to a home-cooked meal was 
always a cornerstone of their family life.

'When we were at school we'd all sit together and talk about what we'd been doing and any problems we had.'

Except
 while the rest of her family enjoyed home-made casseroles and lasagnes,
 Faye would refuse to eat anything but chips. Sometimes she'd even leave
 the dining table to eat them in another room as she was unable to stand
 the smell of her mother's home-cooked meals.

It's enough to make most parents scoff with derision. Surely all that was needed here was a bit of discipline, but Faye insists she was not acting out of teenage faddiness or as an over-indulged brat, her problems were deep-rooted and had begun when she was a toddler.

'Mum couldn't get me to take anything but milk,' Faye says. 'That was all I'd want. She tried desperately to wean me onto meat and pasta and vegetables — she'd turn meals into funny faces, anything to tempt me — but I just refused.

'People would say I was just fussy, someone even advised her to lock me in my room, that I would eat when I was hungry, but nothing worked. And there were times I'd go two days without eating anything. That's when she'd get really worried.

'Finally, when I was about five Mum and Dad discovered I would eat chips. But then that's all I'd eat.

'One doctor warned that if I didn't start eating a more balanced diet I could be dead by 20.'

Desperate to identify the root of the problem, Carolyn took Faye to a succession of doctors. The only diagnosis they could reach was that Faye was a picky eater.

It wasn't until she was 15 that a new GP referred Faye to The Royal London Hospital at Whitechapel and tests revealed she suffered chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It's caused when the muscle at the bottom of the gullet stops working properly, allowing stomach acid to leak up the oesophagus into the mouth, causing an extreme burning sensation — heartburn — and an unpleasant taste.

Long-term sufferers are at a slightly higher risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus.

Often genetic, it runs in Faye's father's side of the family, but it had never been picked up in Faye. Doctors now think she had it from birth.

Faye's condition was initially controlled with medication to inhibit acid production, but her relationship with food had been ruined

Since quitting smoking after her grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer, Faye has put on more than a stone in weight

'Every time I ate it hurt and my food didn't taste nice,' she says. 'It still happens now, but as a child I didn't understand. That's why I didn't want to eat anything, and why I was attracted to milk and chips.'

Sufferers are often told to drink milk as it has a soothing effect because it coats the lining of the oesophagus. Some stodgy foods are thought to help minimise acid production.

After diagnosis, Faye's condition was initially controlled with medication to inhibit acid production, but her relationship with food had been ruined. By now, it was a full-blown phobia she couldn't overcome.

Just the smell of some food is enough to make her flee a room in revulsion and the thought of swallowing anything 'unsafe' sends her into a panic.

Yet she did persevere: after counselling Faye finally moved on from milk and chips and ate her first pizza at 15 — her parents were delighted — then her first burger two years later.

Further progress remains very, very slow: it takes her years to pluck up the courage to try new things.

It's not a disorder that attracts instant sympathy. Strangers can be downright rude about her eating habits, particularly when they see her figure.

And she used to be much slimmer than she is today. Since quitting smoking after her grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer, Faye has put on more than a stone in weight. Yet at 5ft 9ins, she weights 11st 4lbs and is still enviably slim.

'I get a lot of criticism about my diet from strangers,' admits Faye.

'People tell me I'm going to die young if I keep eating like this, that I must be really unhealthy and that I'm going to look old before my time.

'And I know it makes Mum sad that she can't cook for me. She's always really happy when I try something new. She's always coming home from the supermarket with new things to tempt me.

'Recently it was sticks of mozzarella covered with breadcrumbs and she was delighted that I liked them.

'She occasionally gets me to take a multivitamin tablet, but still worries about the impact of my diet on my health.'

And it's not just her health which suffers. Faye, who is single, concedes her love life has been affected.

'When I'm asked out I explain that all I eat are pizzas, burgers and chips. It means I don't ever get to go for romantic meals, though I joke that at least I'm a cheap date.'

And come Christmas Day she won't be enjoying a festive dinner with the rest of the family. Unable to bear the smell of cooked sprouts and roast meat, she'll be in the next room with Chinese noodles and sweet and sour sauce.

'I'd love to be able enjoy a family meal just once,' she says wistfully.
