A mother who fell pregnant at 11 has spoken of the ordeal she faced after her daughter's birth.

Tressa Middleton, now 20, has revealed the trauma she experienced as a warning to Britain's youngest mother who gave birth on Sunday.

Miss Middleton, from Bathgate, West Lothian, was five months older than the schoolgirl when she fell pregnant in 2005 - as a result she spent several years addicted to drugs and alcohol after quitting school.

She was forced to give up her toddler for adoption two years after giving birth - the decision came after she revealed the baby was born as the result of a rape by her own brother.

Today Miss Middleton said she wanted to get in touch with Britain’s youngest parents - the schoolgirl, who became pregnant by her 13-year-old ‘boyfriend’ when she was still in primary school at the age of 11 and gave birth to a 7lb 4oz girl at the weekend.

Miss Middleton told The Sun: 'I send her my warmest congratulations but it will be incredibly tough. At that age you’re so worried about what other people think at school.

'I had people throwing things at me with the baby in the buggy. And the bullies taunting you in the playground -  that’s the worst.'

Miss Middleton discovered she was pregnant in 2005 and at first claimed a local boy was the father to protect her mother, Tracey Tallons, 39.

After giving birth she describes that she never stopped the 'fags and drink', and soon spiralled out of control under the very noses of her social workers.

She ended up in a residential unit, rather than with her child.

'It went downhill from there,' she told the Daily Mail in 2012.

'I was seeing her, but only for short periods.

'She went from calling me Mum and reaching out for me, to not wanting to come near me. She would be screaming.

She tried to commit suicide when she saw authorities were going to take the child away in 2008, swallowing as many drugs as she could.

She told friends she 'didn't want her baby to have a mother who was this f***** up anyway'.

But her stomach was pumped, and her life saved.

When she was 14, she finally revealed that her twisted brother Jason was in fact the father of her child.

When it came out, her family fell apart in the event, and Miss Middleton was left to sign papers authorising the adoption.

'I signed the papers because I knew I would lose in court and they would take her from me anyway. This way I thought I would get visitation rights.'

But she hasn't seen her daughter for six years  - not since she handed her over to her adoptive parents, 'who seemed very nice'.

She is only entitled to a letter twice a year, updating her on her child's progress.

She says she has kept all her child's clothes, and sleeps with a little pink Babygro and hat under her pillow.

'I know the adoption was in her interests. She'll have a better life. But she is still my little angel. She's my girl and I want contact with her. I'd do anything for her.'

In 2009 Jason Middleton was jailed for four years.

He was 16 when the attack happened, at the family home in West Lothian, five years older than his sister.

She says the rape was not a one-off, but part of a wider pattern of abuse.

In 2012 their mother died of pneumonia aged 41 and Miss Middleton says the funeral finally allowed her to forgive her brother.

She said: 'We were both in bits. We didn’t speak to each other but I didn’t feel any hatred towards him. I know what he did was wrong, and so does he.'

Miss Middleton, who is unemployed, is now desperately trying rebuild her life with her fiancé Darren Young, 27, who she meet in 2010.

She fell pregnant with his child when she was 18, but she miscarried a 
few months later - the couple still hope to have a family soon.

Talking about her daughter Miss 
Middleton says: 'I would have given my life for her'  -  but it was a 
complex relationship. There were times I looked at her and I saw my 
brother Jason in her face. That made it hard. But I still loved her, 
with all my heart.'
