James Rodriguez's surgery on a broken bone in his right foot was a success, his Real Madrid club said on Thursday.

The operation was on the fifth metatarsal in the right foot, Madrid added on their website.

The European champions did not say how long they expected him to be sidelined.

Rodriguez was hurt after scoring the opening goal in the 2-1 La Liga win over Sevilla at the Santiago Bernabeu. He was substituted in the first half after doctors examined his foot on the sideline.

The 23-year-old Rodriguez quickly became a first-choice selection for coach Carlo Ancelotti after his arrival following his outstanding World Cup with Colombia, when he was the top scorer with six goals and helped the team reach the quarterfinals.

He has played in 33 of Madrid's 36 games this season, scoring 12 goals and assisting on 10 more.

Real opened up a four-point lead at the top of La Liga ahead of their visit to Atletico on Saturday.

Rodriguez has scored 12 goals and provided 10 assists so far this season since his move from Monaco
