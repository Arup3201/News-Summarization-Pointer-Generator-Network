The saying 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride' has certainly not rung true for one 35-year-old mother-of-two.

Lynsey Littlefield has been a bridesmaid an astonishing seven times - and tied the knot herself in 2007.

The in-demand bridesmaid from Brighton, East Sussex, has been part of a wedding party so often she has joked about advertising her services as a 'bridesmaid for hire'.

The start: Lynsey Littlefield pictured the first time she was a bridesmaid in 2000 at her brother's wedding

But helping so many friends and family plan their hen parties and wedding days has come at a cost - she's spent a total of £7,000 attending other people's weddings over the past 14 years, an average of around £400 a year.

Each time she's walked with a friend or relative down the aisle she's been at a different stage in her own love life. She's been a 20-something single bridesmaid, an engaged bridesmaid, a married bridesmaid, and a pregnant bridesmaid over the years.

Lynsey, who married Daniel, 40, in Ibiza in 2007, said all her experiences have made her one of the best bridesmaids to have. 

Speaking to celebrate National Bridesmaids' Day today, Lynsey said: 'I feel that as a bridesmaid you definitely evolve and become better at it. Now I am thinking I might hire my services out.

'Each time I help organise the hen party from an 80s'-themed hen do to a Strictly Come Dancing party. I'm an expert.

2005 was a busy year: Lynsey was a bridesmaid at her sister's wedding, left, and for close friend, Nicky, right 

'The average cost of each hen party I have organised is £290 – for food, entertainment and extras.

'I worked out I had spent around £5,080 over the years attending hen parties – not including my own.

'Then there is the cost of the weddings. For each one I spend about £50 on the present, £70 on an outfit, £150 on travel and accommodation and if there is a paying bar an extra £50. I would say I spend around £200 per wedding.

'But I don't mind. I have to budget but I love watching people get married.'

Lynsey was first asked to be bridesmaid in 2000 when she celebrated her brother Gary's marriage to Isabel.

She recalls: 'I was honoured when I was asked by Gary and his then-fiancee Isabel to be a bridesmaid,' she said. 'I didn't know it was just the start.

'I had no idea what to do as I hadn't been to many weddings. The wedding was lovely and the bridesmaid dresses were gorgeous.

'I was really surprised at how daunting I found walking down the aisle. I loved the party afterwards.

'Isabel's hen party was the first hen party I had ever been on, too. But not the last.'

In 2005, she was a bridesmaid on two occasions - for her friend Nicky and then her twin sister Claire.

She said: '2005 was a big year as my twin sister was getting married and one of my closest friends Nicky married too.

'I was so happy for them. Claire and her fiance Rob had been together since she was 17 and were a perfect match.

'Nicky had also been with her fiance Ollie since she was 17 and it was so lovely as I had known her through the whole of their romance.

Lynsey was pregnant in 2009 when she was a bridesmaid for her friend Helen

'I was overjoyed when she announced her engagement and then asked me to be her bridesmaid.

'Both my sister and Nicky had a hen weekend abroad and then in the UK – so there was a lot of planning on my part.'

She had her own wedding in 2007 - with two bridesmaids.

She was then a bridesmaid for friend Kate, who was a mother-of-two in 2008 when she married Jon.

'Kate and Jon had two boys so the morning of the wedding was very different to my past bridesmaid experiences – it involved helping Kate but also entertaining two lads,' Lynsey said. 

Her friend Helen's wedding followed in 2009 when Lynsey was pregnant.

She said: 'In 2009 my best friend Helen announced she would be getting married. I was overjoyed but also slightly worried as I was pregnant.

'I was going to be a huge bridesmaid. I felt like I ran down the aisle and cried loads. But it was nice to be sober at a wedding.'

'Then In 2010 my oldest friend Hannah asked me to be her bridesmaid. I hadn't long given birth so wasn't feeling in the best shape.

'I was a new mum so also adapting to motherhood.

'Nevertheless I took my role very seriously and attended dress shopping visits, there were quite a lot, and also organised a great hen weekend.

'I was a really calm bridesmaid this time.'

The mother-of-two was a bridesmaid again for another of her best friends, Georgette, in 2011

Finally, in 2011, Lynsey was a bridesmaid again for another of her best friends, Georgette, and the wedding fell after Lynsey had her second child.

She said: 'I was carrying a lot of baby weight. But I organised a cracking hen do – with Butlers in the Buff. It was a brilliant wedding.

'So that's my decade in the bridesmaid business!'
