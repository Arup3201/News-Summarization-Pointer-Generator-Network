Lawyers for accused terrorist Omarjan Azari say there is a 'glaring error' in the translation of a phone call at the centre of the police evidence against the 22-year-old apprentice mechanic.

Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini SC also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - is being kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit.

Azarai, a former soccer fanatic and Parramatta High School student who grew up in Sydney's western suburbs, was arrested on September 17 at his parents' home in Guildford in what was one of dozens of raids by hundreds of police on homes in Sydney and Brisbane in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation. 

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days before the raids between Omarjan Azari and former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East.

Prosecution screw up: Prominent Sydney barrister, Winston Terracini SC, (pictured outside a Sydney court today) told the court that a phone call at the centre of the case against accused terrorist. Omarjan Azari, had a 'glaring error' in its translation from Arabic to English. He also said authorities had conspired to deny Azari any prison visits by his family

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) during a five month period when counter terrorist police had Aazri under surveillance. Baryalei is rumoured to have since been killed in Syria

Mr Terracini told Central Local Court magistrate Greg Grogin that he had already had an Arabic speaker listen to the phone call in which prosecutors allege Azari made the threat to behead a person in Sydney's Martin Place.

'There is at least one glaring error which goes to the crux of whether this young man is involved in a terrorist act,' Mr Terracini said of the prosecution's translation of the phone call. 

Mr Terracini said despite the Commonwealth DPP serving many documents in its brief of evidence against Azari, 'only one piece of evidence is relevant'.

'It seems to be the fact there is only one telephone call ... and there are inaccuracies in the translation.' 

Around 12 homes were searched on September 17 in Sydney’s northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP).

Azari, who has grown his beard in jail, sat in the Supermax High Risk Management prison video room occasionally touching his face and wriggling in his chair as his case was heard in court. 

He spoke only twice, softly answering 'yes' when Magistrate Grogin asked him questions.

Mr Terracini said Azari, who will apply for bail on December 19, had been prevented from seeing his family by Corrective Services and prosecutors conspiring in a 'secret' agreement to ban 'visitors of any kind ... family, his parents who have no criminal convictions, his sister who has no conviction'.

Commonwealth prosecutor Karen Leavy told the court her office had 'no influence' over inmate classification.

Azari spoke only twice in court, giving a quiet 'yes' when addressed by Magistrate Grogin.

Mr Terracini said Azari's defence team was not interested in the 180 or more documents gathered by the Commonwealth DPP and that the telephone allegedly used in the call from which the terrorism charge arose did not belong to the accused.

'We are interested in the phone used allegedly by this man which the prosecution knows was not his,' Mr Terracini said.

Azari is accused of conspiring with Baryalei 'and others' in planning a terrorist act between 12.01am on March 8 this year and 4.30am on September 18, the time and date of his arrest.

Azari was arrested the day after his parents left Australia to fly to Saudi Arabia for the religious holiday, the Hajj. 

Around 12 homes, including the house (pictured) where Omarjan Azari had been living with his parents, brothers and sister, were searched in Sydney’s northwest suburbs by NSW  and Australian Federal Police

The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP)said was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'.

CDPP prosecutor Michael Allnutt told Central Local Court during Omarjan Azari's last appearance that he had had made a threat during a phone call a few days prior to the raid which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'.

Azari had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police, Mr Allnutt said.

Court documents suggest their plotting began on May 8, and the court heard Azari knew he was under police surveillance.

Since Azari's last court appearance, unconfirmed reports say that Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in Syria.  

Since Azari's last court appearance, following which heavily armed police (pictyred) escorted him from Central Local Court down to the Goulburn Supermax Jail, unconfirmed reports say that Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in Syria

Court documents suggest the plotting for a public beheading between Omarjan Azarai, Baryalei 'and others' began on May 8, and the court heard Azari knew he was under police surveillance

Daily Mail Australia believes Azari is being held in Supermax under NSW prisons highest security classification, which means he would not be allowed to hold telephone conversations in any language but English.

Even his visits from his legal team have been in the metal lined legal boxes inside Supermax.

Ms Leavy said federal prosecutors were assembling material including voice recognition identification and further telephone material from the Attorney General's department.
