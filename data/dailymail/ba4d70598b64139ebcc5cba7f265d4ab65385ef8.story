Tiger Woods’ ex-wife Elin Nordegren has taken the uncharacteristic move of speaking out in public and talked about the hurdles in her personal life after being selected as the commencement speaker for her college graduation.

The Swedish model-turned-American citizen graduated with a degree in psychology from Rollins College in Florida after working through classes over the past nine years.

Nordegren, who is notoriously private and shied away from the media during the fallout of Woods’ cheating scandal and their ensuing divorce, talked about how her academic pursuits ‘offered me a place of peace in the wild storm of my personal life’.

Honored: Elin Nordegren was selected as the Hamilton Holt Outstanding Senior and gave the commencement speech at Rollins College on Saturday

The 34-year-old mother-of-two spoke about  the changes that have swirled around her during her pursuit of her degree.

She said that when she started studying as part of the school’s evening program, she ‘was married without children. Today nine years later, I'm a proud American with two beautiful children, but I am no longer married.’

‘Many of us, like myself, took a long time to graduate,’ she said.

‘If I can inspire even one mom to go back and get her degree with the message that it's never too late, then I am happy.

College graduate: Nordegren now has a degree in psychology from Rollins College

Turbulent times: Nordegren, now 34, talked about how she was married without kids when she started her degree nine years ago and now is divorced and has two children

‘When you told me stories about your full-time day jobs, about coming home to cook dinner for your families, and about making sure your children were cared for while you were attending classes, you inspired me.

Hints: There were several points in the speech where Nordegren referred to her widely-publicized split from Tiger Woods

‘Whatever obstacle I was facing at the time, your stories and sharing helped me put things in perspective.’

She went on to talk about how certain classes came at pivotal times in her personal life, like how she was enrolled in a class on developmental psychology when her now-5-year-old daughter Sam Alexis was born. Other classes, however, came at more chaotic times in her life.

‘It was right after I had taken communication in the media, I was unexpectedly thrust into the media limelight. I probably should have taken more notes in that class!’ she said in allusion to the cheating scandal that was exposed in late 2009 leading to her 2010 divorce from the golf superstar.

‘My psychology in law class helped me through one of the most challenging times of my life that involved legal matters.’

Nordegren was selected as the commencement speaker when she was awarded the school’s top honor of being named the Hamilton Holt Outstanding Senior.

Family support: Elin was flanked by her father and her children, daughter Sam and son Charlie, during the Saturday ceremony

Timely: Though she was not spotted at the ceremony, Elin paid tribute to her mother- a governor in her home country of Sweden- in honor of Mother's Day on Sunday

Getting along: Nordegren (in the black hat and blue shirt) was recently seen at one of her children's games sitting alongside her ex and his new girlfriend Lindsey Vonn

She wrapped up her eloquent speech with a timely tribute to all of the mothers in the audience, saying that she drew inspiration from her own mother, Barbro Holmberg.

‘My mother waited to put her career in a higher gear so that she could be with me and my siblings when we were little. She showed me that it is possible to have a career later in life, and today she's a governor in Sweden,’ Elin said.

‘My hope is that today I am showing my children, Sam and Charlie- who is sleeping in his chair, that it is never too late to follow your dream.’
