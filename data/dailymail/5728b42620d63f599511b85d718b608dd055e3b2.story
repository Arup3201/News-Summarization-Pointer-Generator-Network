Anxious passengers were forced to disembark a Delta Air Lines plane on the tarmac at a North Carolina airport after someone made a bomb threat against the aircraft on Twitter.

Law enforcement officers surrounded the twin-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft after it landed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport from Atlanta.

Nearly 110 passengers were held for nearly three hours while the plane and its luggage were inspected, and everyone on board was checked by police dogs.

Passenger Chris Hart told ABC 11: ‘We had to single file go past a dog. They sniffed us.’

An emergency was declared after a Twitter user wrote that there was possibly a bomb on board flight 1803, said officials.

Raleigh-Durham airport and Delta Air Lines were made aware of the threat against the plane while it was in the air after departing Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Saturday.

Passenger Paul Francis wrote on Twitter: 'There's a security issue on my flight and they are making us go to a remote area of the airport so they can check all luggage and people.'

Traffic at the airport only suffered minor delays. The FBI is investigating the incident.
