As Cara Delevingne, Jourdan Dunn and Hailey Baldwin hit the Topshop Unique runway today, it wasn't just their fierce attitude and covetable clothes that caught our eye.

With their flawless skin, bold red lips and tonal eyes, Sir Philip Green's girls looked picture perfect as they strutted their stuff on the catwalk - but it takes a lot of work and a team of experts who work like a well-oiled machine to look this good.

FEMAIL went backstage ahead of the show and watched Cara and co be beautified by Topshop Beauty's mastermind make-up artist, Hannah Murray.

'This look is inspired by the beachy glamour of the British seaside to complement the clothes,' she told us while expertly applying make-up to Cara's face. 

'The look is fresh faced, youthful and natural looking. There's no base, just primer on the T-zone, concealer where it's needed and Vaseline and a hint of cheek gel on the apple of the cheeks.'

Touch up: While the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage and cheeks complemented the bold lip thanks to a pop of blush

While the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage. ‘Lips are effortless, with a pop of colour and a just kissed glow. The whole look is designed to look like the girls have done it themselves on the bus, they don't care if their lipstick is smudged,' said Hannah.

It's easy - and purse-friendly - to do yourself at home. Use your finger to help create two textures, firstly pat on Lip Ombre in Baffle, before applying Lipstick in Temptation in the same fashion creating a deep burgundy colour on the lips. 

With a clean finger, smudge around the lips to achieve an intense finish with a soft diffused edge and voila, lips a la Cara.

Eyes adhered to the theme we've been seeing at a lot of shows - vivid, tonal and understated.

‘I used a cream nude eye shadow on the eyelids, blending out to create a soft wash of colour before smudging kohl pencil into the lashes and only applying mascara to the top lashes,' added Hannah. 

And it wasn't just the model's faces that Hannah's team paid attention to: nails were beautified too (they are yet another accessory after all).

Taking inspiration from a red, rusty coloured leather jacket, the girls' nails were painted bold red to perfectly complement the vibrancy of the popping lip. 

'This girl has attitude but it’s a subtle confidence, on this occasion it steers away from grungy or harsh lines. With diffused edges and smudges she’s effortlessly cool, allowing her skin to speak for itself,' added Hannah.
