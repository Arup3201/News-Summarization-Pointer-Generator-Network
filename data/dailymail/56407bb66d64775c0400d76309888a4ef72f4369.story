A new app uses a robot to mimic human handwriting in order to customise lavish cards for people who are too busy to write them.

The robot forms part of an app and gift service for people with more money than time, effectively allowing them to send handwritten cards from their iPhone.

The robot imitates human handwriting using fluid movements and differing pressures to make the cursive look authentic.

A new app uses a robot to mimic human handwriting to customise cards for people who are too busy to write them. The robot forms part of an app and gift service for people with more money than time, effectively allowing people to send handwritten cards from their iPhone

The robot-written cards are made by Bond - an app for Apple smartphones and tablets from a luxury gift company of the same name, based in the U.S.

Mimicking human handwriting is deceptively difficult and there are thought to be thousands of ways that letters can be connected together.

The robot must adopt human-like amounts of pressure on certain joins and letters - perhaps such as dotting an I - as well as not smudging the writing to make it looks authentic.

Curiously the robot appears to write from the bottom of the page upwards and from right to left - the opposite way of composing a card in the western world.

The service is currently only available in the U.S. where affluent customers can skip writing their own cards, which cost $5.

For the price, customers get a 255 character message on a gold-embossed card sealed with wax that is sent to their desired recipient.

Bond is primarily concerned with selling gifts, from designer candles and chocolates to vintage sporting gear and users can browse for presents that can cost in excess of $250, to go with their robot-written note.

In the future, the company plans on offering a variety of handwriting styles so customers can pick the one that most closely resembles their own cursive, as well as rolling out an Android app and conventional website.

The robotic card writing service is available in the U.S for $5 for a 225 character message on a gold-embossed card sealed with wax that can be sent to a desired recipient. The text can be ordered using an iOS app, together with a range of luxury gifts
