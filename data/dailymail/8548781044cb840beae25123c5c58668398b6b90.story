He is probably more used to chasing criminals at breakneck speeds.

But former policeman Peter Matheson has decided to take the scenic route for his next adventure - a charity drive to Norway on a vintage tractor which reaches a maximum speed of 15mph.

The 8,000-mile trek will take around four months, and he hopes to raise £100,000 for a charity set up in memory of his friends' son.

He is taking on the challenge to raise money for the Tom Bowdidge Foundation and Unicef.

Tom, of West Bergholt, died aged 19 in October last year after fighting an aggressive stomach cancer.

Before he died he raised more than £100,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust and his parents have set up a foundation in his name.

Mr Matheson bought a vintage Massey Ferguson for £7,000 on eBay and will spend £16,000 getting to Norway and back.

He will be towing a caravan and reckons his top speed will be 15mph.

While driving the vintage Massey Ferguson tractor the father-of-one's wardrobe will be made up of a wet suit and a snorkel as well motorbike leathers and summery shorts, to cover all eventualities

Mr Matheson’s route will be John O’Groats, Colchester, Lands End, Dover, Calais, Nordkapp in Norway.

Vintage 1972 Massey Ferguson tractor from eBay: £7,000

Total spend with travel costs, fuel and insurance: £16,000

20p from every £1 donated will go on fuel. The rest divided between the two charities

Top speed: 15mph

Distance: 8,000 miles

He
 plans to return via Finland, through Denmark, Calais, Dover and Lands 
End before arriving back to John O’Groats by early December.

 father-of-one’s wardrobe will be made up of a wet suit and a snorkel as

Mr Matheson, 50, who used to work in Colchester, said: 'I thought I’d do something a bit different.

'I’ve known Nikki and Richard for 30 years and have kept an eye on how Tom was doing.

I had donated to the foundation but I thought: "What else can I do?"'

He will tow a caravan with a sign telling
 other motorists why he is on the road and why his tractor, which he has
 nicknamed Annie, is going so slow. He will also be joined by his 
Labrador, Amber.

Mr Matheson said: 'I will certainly cause a stir on the road.

'Towing the caravan, my top speed will very low, so people will have plenty of time to get their phones out and donate.'

'On the other hand, I’ll be facing all the elements, so come rain, snow or shine, I’ll have to deal with it.'

Mr Matheson needs volunteers to come forward to drive a Land Rover support vehicle. Each volunteer would only drive for a few days.
