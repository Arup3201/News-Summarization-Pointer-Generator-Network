Sallie Powell, now 47, suffered a range of horrific symptoms for seven years before discovering high levels of calcium were to blame 

A mother struck down with a mystery illness for seven years finally diagnosed herself after Googling her symptoms on the internet in desperation. 

Sallie Powell was so bloated she looked nine months pregnant and the excruciating pains in her joints and overwhelming tiredness had forced her to give up work as a wedding photographer.

Despite seeing several doctors - and even undergoing major surgery - her crippling symptoms continued. 

In desperation, she turned to the internet - and just moments later found the answer that would change her life.

The search results indicated she was suffering from a condition called hyperparathyroidism.

Here, tiny parathyroid glands in the neck which control calcium levels malfunction, causing an excess of calcium in the blood.

This, in turn, was causing her symptoms such as memory loss, depression, extreme tiredness and bloating. 

The mother-of-one, now 47, says she had always been fit and healthy and loved her job as a wedding photographer. 

But a decade ago she began to suffer horrific pain in her shoulders, arms, hands and legs.

'At first doctors said it was arthritis, but tests proved otherwise,' she told MailOnline.

'It got to the point where I couldn't hold a camera any more. I was devastated.' 

As the months passed, she began to develop other worrying symptoms, such as severe memory loss and confusion. 

She said: ‘It was like I was trying to think through a fog. I’d start sentences then couldn’t find the word. 

'I’d taken a job a new job at an electrical store, but I’d get confused at the till.

‘Or, I’d be going somewhere then forget where I was heading.’

Scared dementia was setting in, she avoided social situations and her relationship broke down.

She also suffered crippling headaches, chest pains and heartburn - and felt constantly thirsty. 

'When doctors kept suggesting depression and stress I wanted to scream - I knew it wasn’t just that,' says Ms Powell, who lives in Derby.

Shortly after she was prescribed medication for high blood pressure - and says she became horrified at her appearance.

'When I looked in the mirror, I didn't recognise myself. My hair was falling out and my stomach was so bloated I looked like I was nine month’s pregnant.

Ms Powell was so bloated she looked nine months pregnant - and even required surgery to expand her airways as her nose was so blocked she could barely breathe

‘People kept asking me when the baby was due.'

Doctors then suggested her symptoms could be down to the menopause - and scans revealed she had a condition called adenomyosis, which affects the lining of the uterus.

But even a hysterectomy to try and solve the problem didn't help - and her health was rapidly deteriorating. 

Ms Powell said: ‘By now I was even struggling to breathe. I needed an operation to expand my airways.

‘And each day I could barely get off the sofa. I just wanted to sleep and I was dosed up on so many painkillers.

‘I felt I was dying and panicked what would happen to my son, Jordan, who was only 15 at the time.'

The breakthrough moment came when she was having further tests one day.

'The consultant mentioned I had high calcium levels and told me I needed to go back to my GP.

'But when I got home, I researched my symptoms online - along with high calcium levels - and hyperparathyroidism came up.

We all have four parathyroid glands - each the size of a grain of rice - in our neck, positioned behind the thyroid gland. 

They produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) to help control the levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D within the bones and blood.

But if these glands produce too much PTH, these levels could be sent haywire, causing blood calcium levels to rise and blood phosphorus levels to fall - and symptoms such as Ms Powell's.

The parathyroid glands are nothing to do with the thyroid gland.

'Parathyroid' means 'near the thyroid'. Parathyroid disorders should not be confused with an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid. 

Hyperparathyroidism does not always cause symptoms.

When high levels of calcium do cause symptoms, they can be mild or general, including:

Depression, fatigue, feeling thirsty and passing a lot of urine

Nausea and loss of appetite

Muscle weakness, constipation, stomach ache, loss of concentration

But, if left untreated, high blood levels of calcium can cause vomiting drowsiness

Dehydration, confusion, muscle spasms, bone pain or tenderness, irregular heart beat and high blood pressure

In severe cases, high levels of calcium can lead to loss of consciousness and coma.

‘When I read all the symptoms, such as joint pain, bloating, confusion, weakness, fatigue, memory loss, high blood pressure, heart burn, increased thirst, I realised they matched mine.’ 

There are four tiny glands in the neck called the parathyroid glands, responsible for controlling calcium levels.

In hyperparathyroidism, one or more of the glands malfunctions, producing too much paraythroid hormone.

This results in raised calcium levels in the blood, depositing it in and around the organs and the brain - like cholesterol clogs the arteries.

It also causes calcium to be leeched out of bones and can lead to heart attacks, kidney failure and strokes.

Shocked, Ms Powell printed off her findings and took them to her GP - only to be proved right.

A scan confirmed she had a small benign tumour on one of her parathyroid glands which had caused it to malfunction, causing the raised calcium levels in her blood.

‘All my symptoms had been caused by too much calcium. The first signs had been the pains in my arms and legs, where the calcium was being leeched out of my bones.

‘My brain fog must have been caused by calcium deposits in my brain.

‘My heart burn and huge stomach - calcium in my gut, and my breathing problems calcium in my sinuses.'

In severe cases, high levels of calcium can lead to loss of consciousness and coma. 

Ms Powell was told she would require surgery to remove the affected parathyroid gland.

‘In agony, I crawled into a hospital bed to undergo surgery.

'I went into surgery feeling 95, but after the operation I  woke up feeling 35.

In desperation, she turned to the internet - and just moments later found the answer that would change her life. The search results indicated she was suffering from a condition called hyperparathyroidism. 

She has now joined an online support group to try and raise awareness of the condition 

‘I felt amazing. With all my debilitating symptoms gone, it was like getting my life back.’

But as time went on, she became upset by the years she had lost to the illness.

Sallie, who now runs her own cleaning business, said: 'I lost seven years of my life and I may never have been cured if I hadn’t diagnosed myself. 

'I don’t think there’s enough awareness of this debilitating and potentially life threatening condition'.

She has now joined an online support group to try and raise awareness of hyperparathyroidism worldwide and offer advice.

There is also concern that some patients are only offered surgery when their levels are very high.

'But put people can suffer debilitating symptoms at a lower level as in my case,' said Ms Powell.

'As a group we’re pressing to change regulations so that intervention occurs to take in lower level.'

She has now written to medics across the UK and is travelling around the UK with an endocrinologist (a doctor specialising in hormones) to raise awareness of the condition.

She said: ‘I really believe there could be thousands of people out there who are suffering similar symptoms caused by hyperparathyroidism but have no idea they have this condition.’

This is caused by high levels of calcium - and is often misdiagnosed
