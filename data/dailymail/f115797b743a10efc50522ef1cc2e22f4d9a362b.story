‘There are very few moments in a man's existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress,’ Charles Dickens wrote about having to chasing a hat in The Pickwick Papers.

But in the modern world, the same could easily be said about repeatedly forgetting an important password.

Now researchers have turned to the great Victorian author to help find a way of making passwords both secure and more memorable.

Researchers have turned to the works of Charles Dickens (illustrated) to generate secure but memorable passwords according to new research by US-based computer scientists. They used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within Mr Dickens' Tale of Two Cities to generate new passwords

They used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within Mr Dickens' Tale of Two Cities to generate new passwords.

The process works by looking for two characters that commonly appear together but then generating a third letter that does not.

Millions of internet users still rely upon easy-to-crack passwords such as ‘qwerty’ and ‘123456’, but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts.

However, a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise.

Researchers have shown that passwords such as ‘mnbvcxz’, ‘qaz2wsx’ and ‘adgjmptw’ can be cracked in seconds - and adding numbers to your codes does little to boost its strength.

The analysis was made by hosting firm WP Engine using 10 million passwords recently released by security consultant Mark Burnett. 

They spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people. 

For example, ‘qaz2wsx’ was in the top 30. They also noticed that a website called Zxcvbn scored these words as zero, or low, for so-called entropy. 

Entropy is used to determine the strength of a password in terms of ‘information entropy’.

This comes from information theory and is measured in bits.

The more bits a word is assigned, based on the number of guesses it would take to crack, the stronger the password.

Other words that received a low score include ‘qwertyuiop’, ‘1qaz2wsx’ and ‘zxcvbnm’.

This is because each of these words follow a certain pattern on a keyboard, known as ‘keyboard walks’. 

The same approach is used to generate the third character using the second and third letter and so on.

The result is 56-bit passwords that look like English but are not, making them easy to remember but harder for hackers to guess.

Among the examples produced by the approach from the Tale of Two Cities were: 'The cusay is wither?' and 'Ther highly to a vice of eart'.

This password would be entered as they are typed above, including spaces.  

According to Dr John Clements, a computer and software engineer at the California Polytechnic State University who devised the approach, these are easier to remember than random strings of letters and characters that are often recommended by password generators.

He said: 'Users are very bad at choosing passwords.

'Today, the general assumption - evidenced by the lack of systems using randomly assigned passwords - is that users cannot be expected to recall secure passwords

'If we’re convinced that random passwords are a good idea, and that recalling a 56-bit password is at least within the realm of possibility, we must try to find a set of passwords that are as memorable as possible.'

Research on passwords has shown that most people tend to use letters or words that are easiest for them to remember.

Mark Burnett, a Utah-based password researcher who recently published a list of 10 million passwords taken from those shared over the internet, found that the most commonly used password is 123456 followed by the word password.

Others tend to use their own name or use a password that is identical to their username.

These are easy to break as most hackers will use easy to remember passwords when trying to break into an account.

They will also tend to use real words when attempting to guess someones password.

Online security experts recommend using a random string of letters, numbers and characters that use both upper and lower case letters.

An eight-character password generated in this way can produce around 72 quadrillion possible variations - making it virtually impossible to guess.

However, these are difficult to remember.

Dr Clements' approach, which was highlighted by the magazine New Scientist, uses Markov models which are a way of generating random states based on states that currently exist.

In the approach he took, two letters like 'ca' may appear together in a piece of text, then the chance that they are followed by the letter 'r' is 278/1397 for example.

However the chance of those two letters being followed by the letter 'f' or 'x' is far less in that piece of text.

By randomly generating letters using an algorthim that selects those letters based on meeting certain pobability rules of it appearing with the two preceeding letters in a piece of text, the method produces random but familiar looking passwords.

Dr Clements said that the approach is not just limited to the works of Dickens. Indeed it could be used to generate passwords from a person's own emails, for example.

He said: 'Naturally, the choice of A Tale of Two Cities is largely arbitrary - any corpus of reasonable length will suffice.

'One intriguing possibility would be to choose the full text of all of the e-mails in a particular user’s history.

'This text would presumably reflect the style of text that a particular user is accustomed to read and write, and should in principle be extraordinarily memorable.'
