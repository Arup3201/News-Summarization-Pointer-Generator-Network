McDonald's Hamburger University is considered to be the Harvard of the fast food industry - and it's easy to see why.

Founded in the basement of a McDonald's restaurant in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, the prestigious Hamburger University has grown extensively.

Today, more than 5,000 students, hungry for knowledge, graduate from the program where they learn about the restaurant's operations, service, quality and keeping it clean.

Hamburger University: The Harvard of fast food schools was founded in 1961 by the company's first CEO and grillman

Delicious Diplomas: Hamburger University's first class was composed of just 15 students

Old school: America's Hamburger University has been around for more than 50 years

McDonald’s first grillman Fred Turner and the company's first CEO Ray Kroc founded Hamburger University in 1961.

On February 24 of that year, Hamburger University's first class graduated with a whopping 15 students.

That number has ballooned in recent years, with campuses sprouting up in Tokyo, London, Sydney, Munich, São Paulo and Shanghai.

China's Hamburger University is so exclusive, it has a one per cent acceptance rate - a higher percentage than even Harvard.

'If we are going to go anywhere, we’ve got to have talent,' Kroc once said of his university. 'And, I’m going to put my money in talent.'

McDonald's American Hamburger University is still situated in Illinois in the town of Oak Brook.

Tons of Tongues: The Illinois university has 19 full-time professors and with the help of interpreters, they can teach in 28 languages

Go Hungry: Don't think Hamburger University is a course in consumption: all the food is fake

Customer Service: Employees are trained for specific career paths, be it crew, restaurant managers, mid-managers or even executives

Life Lessons: Students practice customer service in kitchen labs, with fake customers and teachers watching closely

The campus is a sprawling 130,000 square feet and houses 13 teaching rooms, a 300 seat auditorium, 12 interactive education team rooms and three kitchen labs.

The university boasts 19 full-time professors from around the world and with the help of interpreters, they can teach in 28 languages including Spanish, German, French, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

Enterprising employees are trained for specific career paths, be it crew, restaurant managers, mid-managers or even executives.

Made in China: There are Hamburger Universities around the world, including in Shanghai, where the school has an acceptance rate of one percent

McLearning: Every McDonald's manager is required to go through the training; even current CEO, Jim Skinner, is a graduate

Every McDonald's manager is required to go through the training.

McDonald's current CEO, Jim Skinner, is even a graduate.

But don't think Hamburger University is a course in consumption: All the food at Hamburger University is fake.

Students are urged to check out real McDonald's if they need their McMuffin fix. 

The customers at Hamburger University 
are also fake, instructed to give increasingly difficult orders to test 
the service skills of the crew.

Real Deal: A degree in 'hamburgerology' can even earn students college credit at select universities

However, students are given a real diploma when they graduate.

An American version of the degree begins in Latin with the title of the school translated to 'Universatis Hamurgerensis McDonald's.'

A degree in 'Hamburgerology' can even get you college credit at select schools.

Last year was the 50th anniversary of Hamburger University, and so far, more than 270,000 McDonald's employees have their degrees in delicious.

But, there is one thing they don't teach you at Hamburger University: How to escape the Hamburgler.
