An armed robber was rushed to hospital in Zimbabwe after a bizarre attempt to commit suicide in court, it was reported today.

Tendai Learnmore Muza, 24, gulped down poison after declaring he wanted to die when he was convicted of two knife robberies on Tuesday.

The desperate convict collapsed on the floor of the dock before being rushed to hospital following the unusual incident at a magistrate court in Zimbabwean capital Harare.

The New Zimbabwe website reported that Muza produced the bottle of homemade poison after claiming he had been wrongly convicted of two brutal knife attacks.

Addressing magistrate Fadzai Mthombeni, he declared: ‘Your worship, I've a confession.

‘It's unfortunate that this court has found me guilty of an offence I did not commit.

‘The person who committed this offence is walking in the streets freely, so I've decided that my matter be finalised in heaven.’

New Zimbabwe reported that Muza, a married father, then produced a 500ml plastic bottle containing a mixture of chemicals he called 'toilet dip'.

With the court in silence, he added: ‘Your worship, I want you to tell my wife and children how their father died since I am going to kill myself now.’

Police officers rushed to help the convict after he collapsed to the floor during the dramatic scenes on Tuesday.

Muza was rushed for emergency treatment at a hospital inside Harare Remand Prison, where his condition was yesterday described as stable.

The suspect was arrested last year under suspicion of armed robbery after he and an accomplice held up two taxi drivers at knife point to steal cash and mobile phones.

Muza was held on remand ahead of the trial, where he was charged alongside a second man Tapera Maturiro, already serving an 18 month jail term.

Prison officials have launched an investigation into how Muza got access to the bottle of chemicals he produced in court.

The convict's suicide bid came as the magistrate prepared to pass sentence following his conviction on Tuesday.

The magistrate was forced to abandon his sentencing amid the chaos.

He indicated that proceedings would be adjourned until a later date.
