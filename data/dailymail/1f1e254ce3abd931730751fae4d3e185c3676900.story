A Royal Marine who rescued two men from a yacht stranded in stormy seas at night has been awarded the George Medal.

Sergeant Anthony Russell had to dive into the turbulent sea in the dark after the lifeboat holding one of the men flipped over.

As a winchman on a Royal Navy Sea King rescue helicopter based at Culdrose, Cornwall, the 42-year-old from Bath in Somerset, carried out the daring rescue in July 2011.

Brave: Royal Marine Aircrew man Sergeant Anthony Russell gallantly went to the rescue when a yacht became stranded out at sea in the dark and far out from shore

To the rescue: The Royal Marine helicopter, seen here on another mission, arrived to save two endangered fishermen who were battling heavy seas 110 miles offshore

Sergeant Russell was part of a four-man team that rescued two crew from the Swedish yacht Andriette, in 2011. He is among 118 members of the British Armed Forces recognised in the latest Operational Honours for his bravery.

The team was scrambled to help a yacht which was floundering in heavy seas, 110 nautical miles offshore, at night, in extreme weather conditions.

'It was pretty much the worst weather I have ever seen,' said Sergeant Russell. 'Forty foot waves, gale force winds, sheet rain.'

The yacht was being thrown 60 degrees either way, he said.

'When we opened the door it was silence because we looked at it and thought, ‘what do we do?’', he said.

'It was unlike anything you could prepare yourself for in training.'

With limited options, father-of-two Russell volunteered to conduct a conventional winch rescue, which meant being lowered towards the mountainous waves in the pitch black.

'I had been at the end of the wire for about five seconds and this wave engulfed me,' he said.

'I just thought, ‘so it’s going to be like that is it?’ I thought it was over.'

His voice communications were disabled, but he managed to swim to the life raft and haul himself inside.

Desperate: The Royal Marine Aircrew were brought in to save the men after other rescue crews were unable to help them because the weather conditions were so dangerous

He took the older of the two men, raising him up to the helicopter.

'As we came away I saw the life-raft get picked up by the waves and get thrown upside down.

'At that point my heart sank, I thought they were father and son. I couldn’t let this guy realise that what I thought was his son was possibly drowning.'

He strapped the man into the Sea King then went straight back down.

With the lifeboat upside down, Sergeant Russell dived underneath to find the man.

Into the fray: Anthony Russell volunteered to try a conventional winch rescue, which involved being lowered down into the mountainous waves and gale force winds

He found himself stuck, unable to get out, but having not seen him for a minute, his crew raised the winch wire, flipping the life raft back over.

'I couldn’t move either way, something was holding me back. It almost felt like a death grip,' Sergeant Russell said.

'At that point I thought that was me, I thought I was dead. I just have a quick word with myself.'

When the boat flipped over, he realised he was tangled in wires, so cut himself free and managed to rescue the second survivor.

Mission accomplished: Sergeant Russell and his crew often fight through extreme weather conditions to rescue those stranded at sea

The daring rescue has earned Sergeat Russell the George Medal, given 'for acts of great bravery'.

He said receiving the medal was 'awesome' and 'humbling'.

'But at the end of the day it’s your job, that is what we get paid to do'
