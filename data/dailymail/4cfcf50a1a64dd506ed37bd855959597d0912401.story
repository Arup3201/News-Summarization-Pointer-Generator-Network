Sydney's extravagant VIVID light festival hit the harbour city with a bang during its Friday night debut.

The Opera House was lit up in galactic-inspired designs, surreal snakeskin and multi-coloured digital patterns, with one stage of the sequence looking as though Jackson Pollock has taken to the landmark with his famous abstract paintbrush.

Cars with 'feelings', large inflatable animals and an interactive xylophone are just some of the weird and wonderful light displays at this year's festival.

Installations around the harbour and throughout the city were officially switched on at 6pm on Friday by Premier Mike Baird, who hopes the 18-day festival helps boost the NSW economy.

The winter festival began on an unseasonably warm night, with people thronging to the water's edge, and the company behind the lighting of the Harbour Bridge, 32 Hundred Lighting, held an indigenous smoking ceremony aboard the Tribal Warrior boat to cleanse the harbour.

The interactive theme is strong throughout this year's festival, and a stage set up alongside the Museum of Contemporary art encouraged people to try out a foxtrot or tango with the words Strictly Sydney emblazoned behind.

Large videos of dancers from the Bangarra Dance Theatre were projected on the sides of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House - the centre piece of proceedings.

A large section of crowd stood with cameras and phones aloft as its sails changed from psychedelic butterflies to snakeskin in a kaleidoscope of colourful patterns.

'This year's festival has been expanded to five new precincts, including Martin Place, the Carriageworks, the University of Sydney, The Star and Sydney Harbour,' said NSW Deputy Premier and Minister for Tourism and Major Events Andrew Stoner.

Last year's event brought in $20 million and 800,000 visitors, and Vivid Festival runs until June 9.
