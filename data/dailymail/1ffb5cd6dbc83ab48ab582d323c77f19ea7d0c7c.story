Roy Stratford, 44, was jailed for four and a half years after police caught up with his scam, but officers were unable to get any of the money back

A conman builder who scammed the elderly out of their life savings and left one woman so shocked she dropped dead from a heart attack has been jailed.

Roy Stratford, 44, was given four and a half years behind bars today after charging victims for emergency roof repairs despite having no experience in the roofing trade.

In July 2013 he charged one couple £26,000 to fix a leak, but in reality he simply spent an hour nailing a single roll of felt - which can cost as little as £10 - across their roof.

Suspecting that they had been conned, the pair, from Uxbridge, north west London, called in a surveyor to inspect the job.

When they were told when Stratford had done, the wife dropped dead from a heart attack.

In September of the same year Stratford conned another couple in their 80s in Hillingdon, west London, this time charging them £16,000 for 'emergency' repairs to their roof.

However, instead of carrying out the repairs he simply painted their chimney stack.

When police finally caught up with him they connected him to a series of similar frauds across the country, but were unable to claw back any of the money he tricked out of people.  

Detective Constable Anji Dawson, of Hillingdon CID, said: 'Stratford is quite simply a cowboy and a coward who targeted and exploited the elderly and vulnerable for his own financial gain.

'He tricked his way into their homes and conned them out of their life savings.'

Stratford admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and was jailed at Isleworth Crown Court.

Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) heard Stratford charged one couple, in their 80s, £26,000 to fix a leak in their roof, but actually just nailed a roll of felt to it . When they discovered the con, the wife died of a heart attack
