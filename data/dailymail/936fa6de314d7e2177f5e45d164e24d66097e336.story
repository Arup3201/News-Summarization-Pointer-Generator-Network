Dark, desolate and shrouded in mist, these evocative scenes of Paris show a city far removed from its brash confident city we know today.

Regarded the world over as the city of romance and the centre of bohemian culture, the French capital was unrecognisable in 1946, when American photographer Ed Clark travelled there to shoot a profile for LIFE magazine.

Instead of winding passageways where art, music and food spilled out of every building, Clark was met with a city in recovery from the second global conflict in a decade.

Bleak Beauty: Taken in February 1946, the images by Ed Clark show Paris as a city recovering from the ravages of the second world war, here people are pictured buying flowers from a stall near the banks of Pont Neuf

Misty memories: The American photographer was immediately struck by the tragic landscapes of the bohemian city which was far from the brash Paris we know today

Post war winter: A lone mourner walks through The Montmartre Cemetery in the capital. For the second time in a generation, people in Europe were coming to terms with the human cost of war

In the cold winter when he visited, France 
was still finding her feet after the defeat of Germany with many in the 
capital struggling to find jobs, shelter and even food to feed their 
families.

But rather than 
leave disappointed, the snapper said he instantly fell in love with the 
haunting beauty of the city and began shooting straight away.

The result is this collection of pictures which document the human cost of war on one of the the world's most vibrant of cities.

Despite
his enthusiasm for what he saw, LIFE, where not so kind, telling its 
readers Paris was a 'grim and depressing disappointment' and describing 
the locals as 'cold, hungry, confused and tired — above all, tired — too
busy keeping themselves alive to bother much about entertaining.'

Speaking
of what the typical American GI must have thought when he entered the 
famous city, LIFE wrote: 'Where was the Paris he had heard about? Where 
were the naked women?'

Gloomy: The dark, towered mass of the Palais de Justice and Conciergerie, seen from the riverbank. Clark said he was so enraptured by the city's elegance that he began taking pictures as soon as he arrived

Iconic: The skyline of Paris, right, is now known the world over for its association with romance and glamour, but Clark's pictures show a city in mourning, where hunger and unemployment were rife. Tradesman like flower sellers, left, went back to work but many people struggled to find food, jobs or even keep warm in the winter of 1946

Desolate: Here the Palais de Justice looms ominously over the banks of the Seine Canal which is now one of the most commonly visited areas of the French capital

Evocative: The black and white images, such as this showing a river barge churning up the Seine past Notre Dame Cathedral (left), moved Life magazine to brand the city 'grim and depressing'. A shot of the Arc de Triomphe (right) shows how, despite France winning the war, Paris was not in a state of post-war celebration in 1946

Deserted: Now one of the great tourist attractions of the world, the Louvre museum stands empty as the world recovers from yet another terrible conflict
