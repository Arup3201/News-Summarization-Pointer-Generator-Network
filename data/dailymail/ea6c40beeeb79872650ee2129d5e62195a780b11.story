A family wedding reception descended into chaos after a 40-person fight broke out - over a pork pie.

Around 30 to 40 wedding guests were involved in the brawl at the wedding of Wendy Carter and her fiance Ryan Barraclough.

The bride's white gown was doused in beer and WKD as punches were thrown, and children were forced to hide in the toilets at the Harold Club in Low Moor, Bradford, West Yorkshire. 

One woman reportedly had her ear and cheek bitten during the fracas.

A family wedding reception erupted in violence after a 40 man fight broke out - over a pork pie. Around 30 to 40 wedding guests were involved in the brawl at the wedding of Wendy Carter and her fiance Ryan Barraclough

It is not clear exactly how the fight started, but it is believed a pork pie and a water pistol were involved.

But despite chaos, the newlyweds managed to laugh off the incident.

Speaking at their home in Bradford Mr Barraclough,  27, joked: 'We had a brilliant day. It was great and you've got to expect a good punch up at a wedding.'

His new wife added: 'It's just funny now. We had a great wedding and it didn't spoil it.'

Police officers were called after the function crumbled on Saturday evening and made three arrests - one for a public order matter and others for assault.

The public order arrest resulted in a fixed penalty and the other two people were bailed pending further enquiries.

Chris Sowden, 43, steward at the Harold Club said yesterday people had been drinking since 2pm. Apparently there was some tension building for an hour or so before it happened.

He said: It all started with a water pistol then a pork pie got thrown.

'It was completely out of control and by the end about 30 to 40 guests had got involved.

'I've worked here for 14 years and I've never seen anything like it. We had to shut the bar at 7pm when it was supposed to be open until 11.

'The bride was devastated. Her dress was ruined, she had a lovely big white gown and it had beer and WKD all over it.

'I was downstairs when it kicked off and had to go up to try and sort it out. I spoke to some guests and they said the pork pie was thrown and it all got out of control.'

His new wife added: 'It's just funny now. We had a great wedding and it didn't spoil it'

'The scariest thing was there was a lot of children and they all had to hide in the toilets. By the time the police got here the fight had moved to the car park.

'I was amazed nothing got broken. There wasn't even a broken glass. All we had to do was straighten some tables.

'There were about 70 guests in total, it was pretty much all family.

'Mostly people had some cuts and bruises but one of the women involved the initial fight had her cheek bitten and her ear bitten.

'We gave the bride and groom their deposit back as a gesture because they were so upset.

Members of West Yorkshire Police's Dog Unit took to social networking website Twitter where they revealed that they had been called to a 'large fight' at a wedding.

The tweet added: 'All started over a pork pie apparently! #clubclosed #dayruined'
