An eight-year-old girl who was the first in the world to beat a rare brain cancer has passed away just four months after her family were told she had overcome the terminal disease.

Claudia Burkill from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, died in her sleep this morning according to her family who said their lives had been 'destroyed in an instant'.

She had been battling metastatic pineoblastoma since the age of five, and her parents were told on several occasions she only had weeks left.

But just four months ago, the family were assured by astonished medics the tumour had vanished and the little girl had beaten the odds.

Her mother Andrea said: 'Claudia died peacefully in her sleep in the early hours of this morning. Despite her long illness, ultimately, her death is an incredible shock to all that know and love her.

'We urge everyone to treat our family with the grace and dignity that you yourselves would wish for, if your life has just been destroyed in an instant.

'Please give us our privacy as we come to terms with Claudia's death and please give us our space to grieve.'

The family's announcement followed more than 12 hours of torment after Claudia became unwell and failed to respond to treatment.

Claudia was comforted by her pet cat Woody which she felt was 'watching over her' on the bed, her family said.

She was due to have an operation in the past week, but it was delayed by a couple of weeks due to a recent infection.

Her mother posted on her Facebook group, Claudia's Cause, on October 20 saying: 'Claudia has had a feeding tube for three years now and I cannot wait to see her beautiful face again without one.'

Claudia first became ill in June 2011 when the family returned after a holiday and she began vomiting.

After first being told she had a virus, a second visit to Lincoln County Hospital and several tests, including a CT-scan, a lumbar puncture and an MRI, saw doctors diagnose her with a squint.

Mrs Burkill was not satisfied with the diagnosis and after having Claudia transferred to Queens Medical Centre Nottingham, the lethal tumour was found at the centre of her brain.

Over the following years, Mrs Burkill and her husband David  were told on four occasions that Claudia only had weeks to live and they had to start planning her funeral.

Although she suffered some brain damage from the treatment, her family were positive that her health would improve.

After being told her daughter was cancer free and no longer terminally ill in June this year, Mrs Burkill said: 'A miracle has happened, it really has. I just can't stop shaking.'

Doctors only see three or four cases of metastatic pineoblastoma a year and there is still no known cure

Doctors only see three or four cases of metastatic pineoblastoma a year are there is still no known cure.

Claudia first became ill in June 2011 when the family returned after a holiday and she began vomiting. 

Metastatic pineoblastoma is so rare doctors only see three or four cases a year. 

Claudia had treatment called The Milan Protocol at Nottingham Children's Hospital, involving some of the highest doses of chemotherapy ever administered to a child. 

The family has raised thousands of pounds for the children's brain tumour research centre at the University of Nottingham. 

A pineoblastoma is an aggressive, malignant brain tumor that originates from the pineal gland, a small organ located near the middle of the brain. 

Metastasis is the spread of a cancer or disease from one organ to another, not directly connected with it.

Pineoblastomas account for only three to 10 per cent of the total primary malignant brain tumors in children and adults, so it is considered rare.

This type of tumor is usually seen in patients less than twenty years of age, and is most common in children 10 years-old and younger.

The pineal gland is a tiny endocrine organ that lies between the two hemispheres of the brain. 

Shaped like a pair of pine cones, the pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin, which helps regulate sleep patterns. 

More than 17 different types of benign and malignant tumors may arise in the pineal region of the brain. 

A pineoblastoma is one of the most common types of tumors in this area. The underlying cause of a pineoblastoma is currently unknown.
