A Pennsylvania mom was convicted yesterday of charges that she neglected her 6-year-old twins, one of whom was found wandering the streets alone while covered in bruises and feces.

A Washington County jury found 26-year-old Roxanne Taylor guilty of all the charges filed against, including four counts of child endangerment, and one 
count each of aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment,
unlawful restraint and false imprisonment.

Monster mom: Roxanne Taylor was convicted yesterday of charges that she beat and starved her six-year-old twins

Taylor's 6-year-old son was found by a passerby wandering the streets alone after he escaped from his locked bedroom in Taylor's home through a window. When the passerby found the boy, he was covered in feces and bruises, and weighed a scant 30 pounds.

When police went to Taylor's home, they found the boy's twin sister, also covered in bruises and feces. According to police, the 6-year-old twins still wore diapers.

Throughout the home, police found feces and insects everywhere. Additionally, there were locks on the children's bedroom doors, as well as on the refrigerator and their toy chest.

Taylor told authorities that she kept locks on the doors because she was a heavy sleeper and didn't want the children wandering through the house at night.

Bruises: Taylor told jurors she's a 'good mother'

Taylor reportedly testified in her own defense last week, explaining to jurors that the children's being underweight was the result of them being 'picky eaters,' and that she's a good mother.

The father of the two children also was criminally charged for their neglect and abuse. Edward J. Buckholz, 34, pleaded guilty last month and will be sentenced in September by Judge Katherine Emery.

Taylor also is scheduled to be sentenced in September.
