A San Antonio mother and her 13-year-old daughter have been found shot dead along with the woman’s husband in what police are calling a double murder-suicide.

According to investigators, Hector Davila Jr, 44, killed his 41-year-old estranged wife, Irma Davila, and her daughter, Destiny, in his home Wednesday night before turning the gun on himself.

Friends of the victim said Mrs Davila separated from her husband recently, but he was desperate to get her back.

Grisly crime scene: Officers who were called to Hector Davila's home on Globe Avenue saw blood throughout the residence and three dead bodies

Police officers were called to Hector Davila's home in the 400 block of Globe Avenue at around 5.30pm Thursday in response to a welfare check request.

One of the first responders peered through a window and saw blood spattered throughout the home. Inside the residence, police found the body of Hector Davila lying on top of his dead wife, with an automatic handgun next to him.

Destiny Davila, 13, was discovered dead against a bathroom wall. 

A preliminary report from the medical examiner’s office cited by My San Antonio showed that the mother and daughter died from blunt force trauma and/or a gunshot wound to the head. Hector Davila ended his life by shooting himself in the chest.

According to the woman's friends, she and Hector had a rocky marriage, and she recently asked for a divorce.

But on Wednesday she agreed to come to her estranged husband’s home for dinner with Destiny in tow.

Irma's best friend and neighbor Linda Barrientos told News 4 San Antonio that she last saw Irma Davila alive at around 9pm Wednesday when the woman stopped by her house on her way to dinner with Hector.

The next morning, Barrientos noticed that her friend’s car was still parked outside the Globe Avenue address and she had not been returning her calls.

Described by those who knew her as a great mother and a cheerful presence in the lives of everyone around her, Irma is survived by her two grown sons.

‘My mom was really the thing that kept us together,’ John Gonzales told the station KSAT. ‘And my sister, you know, that was my heart. We only felt right when they were around.’

A makeshift memorial has sprung up on the porch outside the crime scene, with bouquets of fresh flowers and photos of the strikingly beautiful mother and her teenage daughter.

At around 8pm Saturday, Irma's friends and family returned to Globe Avenue for a candlelight vigil to honor the victims.
