If anyone's going to twerk it, it's the dancers at London's Notting Hill Carnival this bank holiday weekend.

And to help the rest of us shape up and shake our booty like the pros, Red Bull has released a 'how to' video demonstrating some of the must-have moves.

In the video a bunch of Londoners take to the camera wiggling their posteriors in the spirit of carnival that will see jerk chicken and twerk dancing in abundance.

The dancers limber up for the big twerk out by flexing their muscles in figure-hugging outfits before letting all hell loose on the dance floor.

They work through a series of moves including the Big N Nasty, Tempa Wine and Bruk It Down that the rest of us can only dream of copying.

No matter, with a beach for the video back drop, there's no stopping the dancers as they get into the spirit of the Caribbean festivity.

The annual event has taken place since 1966 and is led by members of the West Indian community.

Historically steel bands, Soca & Calypso Music have been at the heart of carnival but in recent years these have been overtaken by sound systems playing anything from Reggae to R&B, Funk, House and Dub.

This year belters Basement Jaxx will be headlining the Red Bull Music Academy Sound System providing plenty of opportunities for revellers to twerk it out.
