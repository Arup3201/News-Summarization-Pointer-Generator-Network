Peter Madoff showed some real chutzpah by going to his daughter’s lavish bat mitzvah yesterday after his family pleaded with a judge to delay his 10-year prison sentence.

The brother of shamed Ponzi-schemer Bernie Madoff was pictured by the New York Post attending his granddaughter’s bat mitzvah at a posh synagogue in Midtown Manhattan.

Peter was sentenced to join his brother in prison on December 10, but because of desperate pleas from rabbis and family,

According to the New York Post, which exclusively reported the details of the Madoff’s last hurrah, said that the 67-year-old grandfather was greatly enjoying himself and socialized with friends and family eating bagels and lox.

The bat mitzvah, celebrating the traditional Jewish coming of age, was for his granddaughter Rebecca Skoller.

Ms Skoller read passages from the Torah during the ceremony, and then joined her grandfather and more than 100 guests for food and fun.

Madoff pleaded guilty to his role in the world’s biggest and most devastating Ponzi scheme on June 29, 2012, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison on December 20.

In addition to his impending incarceration, the 67-year-old agreed to forfeit up to $146billion of his assets. His older brother is currently serving out a 150-year sentence. 

Peter Madoff admitted to, among other things, engaging in money transfers meant to avoid taxes, putting his wife on payroll for a job she never worked, and committing wire and mail fraud.

Forbes reports that Madoff has requested to do his time at Otisville Prison Camp, a medium security prison that was named by the magazine was one of America’s top 10 ‘cushiest prisons.’

But before Madoff swears off suits for prison-sanctioned sweats, he is expected to continue celebrating his granddaughter’s coming-of-age at an event space in Midtown West.

The location, 404 NYC, offers thousands of square feet for dancing and feasting. A source told the Post that a celebration like a bat or bar mitzvah could cost upwards of $75,000.

Victims of the Madoff brothers were outraged to hear that the convicted Ponzi schemer was still enjoying the good life while many of them had lost their life savings.

‘I would much prefer that Peter Madoff be locked up and the only way he can attend the bat mitzvah is through pictures sent to him in prison,’ 62-year-old Michael DeVita told the Post. Mr DeVit was one of thousands who lost his retirement assets to the scam.

At the time of his conviction, Peter Madoff said that he was ‘deeply ashamed and terribly sorry’ but he didn’t know about the scam until his brother revealed it in December 2008, in the heyday of the housing crisis.

He worked alongside his brother for more than 40 years. Close to $20billion vanished in the scam, the Associated Press reported, making the Madoff scam the largest Ponzi scheme in the U.S.

The scheme left behind only a few hundred million dollars, not the $65billion claimed in bogus financial statements.

Madoff revealed in court that he agreed to assist his brother Bernie in sending out the only money left to favored people, including friends and family.

Peter Madoff was credited with creating a computer trading system for the firm in the late 1970s and early 1980s that was considered groundbreaking at the time. He ran the daily trading operation while his brother focused on the more secretive investment advisory arm.

Both brothers made a fortune. Peter Madoff owned a vacation house in Palm Beach, Florida that recently sold for $5.5million.
