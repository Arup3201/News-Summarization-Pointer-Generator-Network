A 73-year-old pensioner is facing jail today for clubbing his neighbour with a hammer in a row over a bonfire.

James Sharrod was so enraged over smoke coming into his mobile home from James Killian's garden that he crept up on Mr Killian and attacked him with a lump hammer.

Mr Killian, 51, was gardening at his detached £260,000 home in the village of Parkmill on the Gower coastline when Mr Sharrod entered through a gap in the fence, Swansea Crown Court heard.

Quiet village: Parkmill in South Wales where the two neighbours came to blows

Smoke from the bonfire had blown into the caravan park, Cannisland Park, through Mr Sharrod's windows.

Prosecutor Dean Pulling said that Mr Killian had begun extinguishing the fire when Mr Sharrod entered the garden. 

Terrified: Angela Killian came to rescue her husband when she heard his screams coming from the garden

Mr Sharrod 'launched' at him, striking his head and body with a hammer he had hidden behind his back.

The attack left Mr Kilian 'covered in blood' and he required seven stitches to a two-inch gash to his head.

Mr Killan's wife Angela wrestled Sharrod off her husband after hearing his screams for help.

She told the jury she thought her husband was being murdered when she saw the attack.

Passing cyclist Trystan Jones told the court: 'I looked at the man and he was covered in blood.

'It looked like something out of a film.'

'He said he had been attacked by a neighbour who had hit him over the head with a hammer.'

Mr Sharrod claimed he acted in self-defence, but was found guilty.

Judge Paul Thomas gave Mr Sharrod bail but warned him, despite his age, he could be facing a long prison term when he is sentenced next month.

He told Mr Sharrod: 'I want to know something about your physical and mental health before I pass sentence.'
