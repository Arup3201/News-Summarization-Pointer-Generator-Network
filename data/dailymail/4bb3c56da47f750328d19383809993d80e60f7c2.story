Police have reportedly spotted a missing man who shot dead an ex-Marine and injured a state trooper 10 days ago, but he has refused to surrender. 

On Monday, law enforcement officials said on scanner reports that they had positively identified 31-year-old Eric Frein in a search area of the  Pocono Mountains, thePocono Record reported. 

Police would not confirm or deny seeing Frein in a press conference this morning. Authorities have allegedly been authorized to use lethal force if Frein refused to surrender, according to Monroe County emergency radio reports. 

However, they did share pictures of an AK-47, believed to have been used or stored by Frein for his attack on a state police barracks in the Poconos Mountains.

The discovery of the weapons comes as Pennsylvania Gov Tom Corbett spoke Frein at a press conference, saying local authorities are 'confident' they will find the man still 'out in those woods right now'.

Police found this AK-47-style rifle and magazines as they continue to hunt for cop-killer Eric Frein, 31, in the Poconos 

Police have narrowed down their search for Frein based on a number of sightints.

'Based on our investigation, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years,' State police Lt Col George Bivens said on Sunday. 'He planned his attack and his retreat - however, we believe we are closing in on him.' 

Frein has been on the run since Friday September 12 after allegedly using a high-powered rifle to open fire from the woods near a state police barracks, killing Cpl Bryon Dickson - a married ex-Marine with two sons - and wounding Trooper Alex Douglass.  

At large: Eric Frein, 31, is still on the run ten  days after police said he killed an ex-Marine and a state Trooper

The search team has largely shut down the area where he lived with his parents and erected barricades around the area.

A 'shelter in place' order has been lifted for residents but citizens have been urged to avoid the woods and take caution when outside of their homes.

Law enforcement officers wearing bulletproof vests and armed with rifles were seen marching the streets, with an unmarked helicopter flying overhead.

Frein - described as holding a grudge against police - is now on the FBI's Most Wanted list.

'Our troopers are determined to find him and bring him to justice,' state police spokeswoman Maria Finn said. 

Police released few details about their search of the heavily wooded community in the Poconos, saying only that they were exercising extreme caution. 

Closing in? Officers insist they have narrowed the search to lock down on the area where Frein's parents lived. Above, Pennsylvania State Police officers move quickly with their weapons on Route 477 on Sunday

Frein, a self-taught survivalist, has been on the run ever since, authorities said. 

But some who know him said he has not always played the loner, and the reason for his hatred of police remained a mystery.

Frein belonged to the rifle team at Pocono Mountain High School, and as an adult joined a group that performed military re-enactments of Eastern European conflicts in the modern era.

He even played a small role in a 2007 movie about a concentration camp survivor - earning him a mention in the movie database IMDb - and helped with props and historical references on a documentary about World War I.

'He was a very friendly guy to me,' said Jeremy Hornbaker, who hired him for the documentary. 'We left on very good terms.'

Frein's father, retired Army Major E. Michael Frein, told police that he had taught his son to shoot. 

Order lifted: A Shelter In Place order for residents has been lifted but police warn residents to avoid the woods

Flashing lights: Police State Police vehicles speed up Snow Hill Road on Route 447 in Price Township on Sunday

Wanted: Posters have been released across Pennsylvania and in neighboring states to track down Frein

Reward: The FBI is offering a reward for anyone who finds Frein, who is on the bureau's Most Wanted list

He 'doesn't miss,' the father told state police during a search of the family home, when he also disclosed that an AK-47 and a .308 rifle with a scope were missing. It is not clear which, if any, of these rifles was the gun found today.

A copy of the book, 'Sniper Training and Employment,' was found in his bedroom.

Frein had for a time attended nearby East Stroudsburg University and held a number of jobs over the years but never any for very long, authorities said. 

A week after the killing, they had not said anything about what may have led to his hatred of police.

Frein's only known legal problems stemmed from the 2004 theft of some vendor items at a World War II re-enactment in Odessa, New York. 

He failed to show for his trial, and was arrested in Pennsylvania as a fugitive from justice.

On Frein's MySpace page, a photo appears to show him standing in front of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade. Frein played the part of a Serbian soldier in his re-enactments and the FBI said he had claimed to have studied Russian and Serbian and to have 'fought with Serbians in Africa.'

The FBI's Most Wanted poster describes him as 6'1", 165lb. State police said he apparently cut his hair into a wide Mohawk in preparation for the attack. He was also described as a heavy smoker.

Police did not say how big of an area they are combing or whether they believed they had Frein. A police dispatcher said there was a report of gunfire Friday night but investigators released no information.
