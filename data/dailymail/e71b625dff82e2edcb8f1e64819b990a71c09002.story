Yesterday, my baby son reached the grand old age of 40. How did that happen? You know, one minute you're looking at your first child and wondering what to do with 'it' - and the next you're watching him blow out a very large number of candles.

We've been through a lot together, my boy and I and, in truth, I owe the greatest gift of my life to him.

All of us read a lot (too much?) about the stresses and strains of motherhood, about mums who feel bored by the chores and long to get back to work. Fathers and mothers are rightly concerned about what they can and should teach their children, and manuals for parenthood proliferate on the shelves.

Birthday boy: Bel Mooney with her son Daniel on his 40th

But what of those instinctive lessons our babies teach us? It was my Daniel who taught me how to be a mother before he could speak - and I rejoice that those lessons in love have never ended.

I'd be lying if I said I wanted to be pregnant. In fact, when I got the news, I felt like a plane that had been hijacked and was heading for an unknown, scary destination.

Back in 1973, I'd been married to my first husband, Jonathan, for five years already but was enjoying my life as a journalist-about-town, wild at heart and eager to pack a bag and travel when the story needed it. I'd never held a baby and didn't want to.

When I discovered I was pregnant, and on the hunt for tips, I watched my sister-in-law change her daughter Kate's nappy. I thought the whole business daunting and revolting in equal measure.

Refusing to acknowledge what was happening, I took risks. Though pregnant, I still took a job as a presenter at the first British commercial radio station, LBC.

Reluctant mother: But Bel embraced her role once Daniel arrived

It was very chaotic and I'd never presented a live radio show before, but I accepted the stress because I refused to give in to the changes in my body. Not for me relaxing into pregnancy: I drank wine because nobody told me not to, and stayed up as late as I ever had.

How stupid I was! Unhappy, exhausted and irresponsible, I felt entirely unready for motherhood.

Then it happened. The everyday miracle. Dan was born on January 8, 1974, weighing just 4lb 13oz. With his low birth weight and jaundice, he was in the Special Care Unit, keeping me (somewhat weepy) in hospital for 12 days.

I believed it was all my fault, but remember wanting to do everything for him. I surprised myself, confidently bathing his tiny slippery limbs as if I'd been doing it all my life. Or perhaps the bookish girl turned tough-talking lady journalist had actually been practising in her dreams for the role that fitted with surprising ease.

'Nobody ever tells you how hard it is to bring up a child - and how anything that goes wrong feels entirely your fault'

I fell in love with my son in a way 
that was entirely new. You've loved your parents and then that First 
Love and then the man you married... but nothing like this! The apricot 
smell of Dan's head melted my heart into a different shape, like wax in 
the hands of an artist.

Alone
 for much of the time, because my husband's job as a television reporter
 took him far away for weeks on end, I became fascinated by nappies, 
bottles and baby clothes.

Each
 day I would put Dan in his carrycot and push him all the way across 
Clapham Common simply to visit the good chemist and pore over dummies 
and jingling toys. Who would have thought it?

I'm
 not saying I never chafed, never wished I could meet friends to smoke 
and drink too much in a Fleet Street pub in the old way, never wanted to
 kick over the traces and be free. Of course I did. But the rebellious 
voice was drowned by the coos and cries of my son. I felt somehow that I
 was getting it right with him - and that seemed as great an achievement
 as my degree or my first big byline in a national paper.

His ready smiles were my reward, his first word - 'Mumma' - like music. Even though I was unavoidably living like a single mother a lot of the time, thanks to my husband's job, and missed him terribly (he was as besotted with our son as I), I discovered that a baby can be a real companion. Some days it felt like just Dan and me against the world.

He was my consolation, too. In November 1975 I gave birth to my second son, who was stillborn after a long, grim labour. I'd been hospitalised for two or three weeks and so my parents had taken Dan.

When my mother arrived after I had been released, I sobbed to her: 'I want my baby.' At that very moment, Dan, who was not yet two, toddled into the room and his face lit up as he said, 'Mummy!' with an air of purest wonder. 'Here is your baby,' said my mother. And so he was.

But nobody ever tells you how hard it is to bring up a child - and how anything that goes wrong feels entirely your fault.

Devoted: Bel with her son when he was aged five

I look back over the years of the adorable, smiling, trouble-free baby, the sweet little boy, the insecure 12-year-old who was so helpful at home - and wonder how he became that rebellious teenager and even more wayward young man. Gosh, they put you through it! My beloved baby became a wild, bad, lazy creature and behaved appallingly at one time, yet somehow or other he'd deliver that enormous grin and careless apology, and be forgiven. As the mothers of East End gangsters might say: 'My boy was always good to 'is muvver.'

Not academic at all, he dropped out of university with various problems and this was a very tough time indeed, but his father and I were determined he shouldn't feel a failure. So he did a chef's course, which led in time to a trial as a runner on the television programme Ready Steady Cook.

Willing to take on the most mundane tasks with that ready grin, Dan worked his way up the ladder to become a producer-director, working with Jamie Oliver among others.

Oh yes, mothers remember all the anxiety and some of the heartbreak, too; you can still remember the anguish at failed relationships; you can wax sentimental over treasured keepsakes yet still feel a spurt of angry frustration at his wasted chances and poor judgment.

I can still feel irritated by his failings, like his inability to give up nicotine, but he is still impossible to be angry with

But then you realise that all those stages created the whole person, transforming him into the man he is. And when my marriage broke up in 2003 it was my children who shared the grief and offered the most comfort. They took care of me - and that doesn't come from nowhere. That's a result of the whole miraculous process of mothering: the learning and loving that is a two-way street.

Therefore, I would change nothing. Sometimes I tell Dan I am proud of him, and he looks amused and disbelieving as he wonders why. It's because he's always had the courage to remake his life - earning the love of a wonderful girl (now his wife) and becoming a devoted father, even though he once told me he didn't want children.

Through the years: Mother and son when Daniel was 17

When he realised that his life at the sharp end of TV was harming him and possibly his new relationship, he came up with a brilliant idea for reinvention. Passionate about VWs and food in equal measure, he located a very rare 1964 ice cream van and set up his own business.

Now he and his wife are the Splitscreen Ice Cream Company, living a carefree but hardworking life serving delicious ice-cream at festivals, events and weddings, and expanding each year.

And 40 years after that baby boy took over my life, he is still making demands. We share space at home, since he and his wife and baby son live next door to us in the countryside outside Bath. I have to tolerate his growing fleet of vehicles, just as I once had to put up with the toy cars that littered the house.

I can still feel irritated by his failings, like his inability to give up nicotine, but he is still impossible to be angry with. And, hearing the ice clink into the bucket and the corks pop, I know he is still the person with whom, apart from his sister Kitty, I most like to party. What more can a mother say?

So happy birthday, Dan - and thanks for teaching me so much. And for the fun.
