She started one of the biggest hair trends of all time with a layered bob that was dubbed ‘The Rachel’.

But fans might find it tricky to copy Jennifer Aniston’s fiddly new style without enlisting the help of an army of hairdressers.

The 44-year-old actress sported a deep side parting with an intricate braid across the left side of her head at a Hollywood bash this weekend.

The current style is often favoured by much younger stars like Jennifer Lawrence.

Attending an awards ceremony without her husband-to-be Justin Theroux, Miss Aniston took to the stage to debut her new look.

Showing off gym-honed arms in a black strapless dress, she looked worlds away from the girl-next-door style that helped her find fame.

Her bouncy cut, named after the character Rachel Green, was copied by salons all over the world.

But the Friends star later confessed she always hated the hairdo.

Its creator Chris McMillan recently admitted that he was 'stoned' when he came up with the style.

Having now teamed with Aniston on a range of hair products he said that he was under the influence of drugs when he came up with the look in 1994.

Fans are wondering what style the actress will chose for her upcoming wedding to actor Justin Theroux.

The couple, who met while making the flop 'Wanderlust', are due to get married later this year.

Aniston was without her fiancée when she attended the Guys Choice awards in Hollywood over the weekend where actors Ben Affleck was among those honoured.
