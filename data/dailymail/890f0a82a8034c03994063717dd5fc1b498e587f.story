He is a professional eater who has taken part in 200 challenges in eight different countries and 22 states around the world.

But, for Randy Santel, the Breaking Badass meat feast competition in the UK proved a spare-rib too far, as the 28-year-old failed to finish a 7lb meal.

Randy crossed the Atlantic to take part in the Longhorns Barbecue Smokehouse challenge in Newcastle, attempting to munch his way through brisket, beef rib, hog butt, a rack of pork ribs, Andouille sausage, chicken wings, three bean chilli, coleslaw and brioche buns.

Pitted against local man Marc Pitt, from Bensham, Gateshead, Randy finally met his match as he admitted the £35 UK test - which must be eaten within an hour - had beaten him.

If the Man v Food-style challenge is completed, the meal comes free plus the winner gets a T-shirt, and their picture posted on the restaurant's wall of fame.

Randy, who is currently eating his way around the world, revealed he first got into eating challenges after winning a body transformation contest.

He added: 'I got sent to New Zealand and got a role in the TV show Spartacus.

'To celebrate, me and a friend finished off a 28-inch pizza and got $500 (£330) for it and from there it just took off.'

Marc, 24, said: 'I've done a lot of challenges around the North East as a bit of a hobby.

'I tried the Longhorns one previously and couldn't do it as I ran out of time and the same has happened again.'

The challenge comprises brisket, beef rib, hog butt, a rack of pork ribs, Andouille sausage, chicken wings, three bean chilli, coleslaw and brioche buns

A rib too far... Marc concentrates as he competes against Randy to finish the large meal in less than an hour

Britain's Man v Food fever is high as a rising number of pubs, restaurants and diners stage competitive eating challenges.

Last year, Smokeys restaurant in Walsall, West Midlands, organised an 11lb Brussels sprouts challenge, which was attempted by 19-year-old Lauren Jackson. 

But unfortunately for the self-confessed sprout lover, she fell foul of the task and had to fork out £19.99 for her plate of greens.

A 15lb, 12,000-calorie Real 3-Bird challenge was organised by The Black Bulll restaurant in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. 

The meal, which cost £56, would have fed a family of four but was on offer for just one person, to complete within the one-hour time limit. 

The challenge was so gargantuan that the restaurant had to draw up a disclaimer warning those with heart conditions or underlying illnesses about the dangers of such a calorific meal - but if diners could eat the entire thing in an hour they would  get the whole lot free.

And Papa Joe's Cafe in Tenterdon, Kent, served a one-and-a-half-foot-long dish forms the cafe's 10Terden Terminator Mega Breakfast Challenge which contained 10 each of eggs, bacon rashers, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and hash browns, and a generous side of baked beans. 

The 7,000-calorie breakfast challenge was  successfully completed by three couples but no individual managed to polish off the entire meal.
