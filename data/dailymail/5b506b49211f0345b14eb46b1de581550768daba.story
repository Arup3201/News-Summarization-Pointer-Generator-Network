Two mothers have been charged with cruelty after leaving their children at a beach bar to go on a Mother's Day booze cruise, police said.

Billie Jean Williams, 27, and 28-year-old Mary Joyce Daffron were arrested after their children, aged eight and six respectively, went up to staff at Gator Joe’s Bar and Grill in Ocklawaha, Florida and said that their mothers had gone.

The mothers allegedly left their children in the care of a man they had just met while they went on a booze cruise on Lake Weir on Sunday.

The man, named only as John, told police that he knew one of the women from high school, according to a report from Marion County Sheriff’s Office.

He said that Williams and Daffron had both taken off for the booze cruise an hour earlier.

The mothers' belongings were lying on the beach close to where they left their children playing. 

As the booze cruise returned to shore, the two highly intoxicated women fell into the water as they tried to disembark, according to ocala.com.

Williams screamed at her eight-year-old 
for having the police called and claimed that the young children had 
been left in the care of a 'godfather' - despite the fact neither women 
knew his last name.

Both women were arrested on Sunday and the two children handed over to relatives.

Williams and Daffron have been charged with cruelty toward child-abuse child without great bodily harm. Daffron faced an extra charge of resisting arrest without violence.

Bail was set at $5,000 for Williams and she was released after posting bond. Daffron remained locked up on Monday after bail was set at $5,500.
