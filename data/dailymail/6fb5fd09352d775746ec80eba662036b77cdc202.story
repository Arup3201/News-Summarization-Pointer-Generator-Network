Criticism: Britain's top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood was lambasted last night by MPs for his bungled probe into the 'Plebgate' row which cost former minister Andrew Mitchell his job

Britain’s top civil servant was lambasted last night by MPs for his bungled probe into the ‘Plebgate’ row which cost former minister Andrew Mitchell his job.

A damning report by an influential Commons committee  castigated Cabinet Secretary  Sir Jeremy Heywood for failing to conduct a proper investigation into discrepancies between the police version of events and CCTV footage.

Downing Street today defended the top mandarin, insisting David Cameron stood by the much-criticised report.

The former Chief Whip was forced to resign over allegations that he called a policeman a ‘f***ing pleb’ after he refused to let him cycle through the gates of Downing Street.

Mr Mitchell says he was the victim of a conspiracy.

The Commons public administration committee’s report concludes that Sir Jeremy, who earns £190,000 a year, is not an ‘appropriate’ person to conduct inquiries into accusations of ministerial misconduct.

The report is a humiliation for the man who is so powerful that he is known as Mr Cameron’s ‘right-hand mandarin’.

In their investigation on Plebgate, the MPs found that Sir Jeremy:

One senior parliamentary source said: ‘If the Cabinet Secretary had done his job properly, it is highly unlikely Mitchell would have had to resign. The police claims would have crumbled.’

Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the committee, said Sir Jeremy’s investigation ‘clearly failed to uncover the truth’. He added: ‘The Cabinet Secretary attempted to investigate this matter but failed to resolve or even to investigate the questions arising from the discrepancies in the accounts of the events, or to advise the Prime Minister that they required further investigation.’

Heywood faces humiliation over his inept handling of the 'Plebgate' inquiry, which cost Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell his job

Sir Jeremy told the committee two weeks ago that he had suspicions that Mr Mitchell might have been the victim of a ‘gigantic conspiracy’ by the police. Despite this, the report found that he failed to conduct a proper inquiry.

It said: ‘Sir Jeremy should have advised the Prime Minister that these questions required further investigation and therefore a wider inquiry.’

Today Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'As regards the review that the Cabinet Secretary undertook, the Prime Minister remains absolutely of the view that it was the right review at the right time.

'He fully supported the conclusion it reached - that the additional information received (in two emails) could not be considered reliable - and so the Prime Minister's initial conclusion was unchanged.'

One of the first calls David Cameron 
makes when he starts work in the Downing Street flat at 5.45am is to 
Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood. He is one of the last people he 
speaks to at night.

No
civil servant in modern times has enjoyed such unrivalled power as 
Heywood, who has served three chancellors and three prime ministers.

Today,
however, he faces humiliation after an excoriating report by the 
Commons public administration committee into his inept handling of the 
‘Plebgate’ inquiry, which cost Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell his job.

Despite his blunders, no major decision is made without the PM consulting the Harry Potter lookalike Cabinet Secretary: The PM walks with Heywood (right) and Sir Gus ODonnell Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service (middle)

If
a minister was subjected to such damning criticism he would be unlikely
to survive the ensuing firestorm. For now, Heywood continues to enjoy 
the full confidence of the Prime Minister. Yet the committee’s criticism
that Heywood was not rigorous enough is all too familiar.

Last
summer, Sir Richard Branson feared the bidding process for the 
multi-billion-pound West Coast rail franchise was going against his 
company, which ran the line. The Virgin train boss was sure the 
Department for Transport’s figures were wrong. In a series of letters he
warned the PM, but to no avail. Who did the PM pass the correspondence 
to? Sir Jeremy Heywood, of course.

The
Cabinet Secretary sought assurances from the Department for Transport, 
and reported back to Mr Cameron that nothing was amiss. Only later did 
it emerge that the mistakes officials made in calculating the bids – 
which led to the decision to award the franchise to Virgin’s rival 
FirstGroup being scrapped – will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of 
pounds.

Heywood was the driving force last year behind the move to hand control of BAE, one of Britain's last major manufacturers, to a European consortium, a move which, surprisingly Cameron backed

One ministerial source said: ‘Heywood never asked the right questions.’ The same criticism is made of him today over ‘Plebgate’.

Despite
his blunders, no major decision is made without the PM consulting the 
Harry Potter lookalike Cabinet Secretary. Heywood, the PM’s chief 
adviser and confessor, attends the daily strategy meeting – a select 
group that includes Chancellor George Osborne and chief of staff Ed 
Llewellyn.

He
sits next to Cameron at Cabinet meetings. He keeps the minutes, but his
power extends far beyond taking notes. He has a desk outside the PM’s 
study so he can see who goes in and out.

Heywood has exploited his place in the privileged inner circle to stray deep into areas of policy

So who is this Teflon-coated Sir Humphrey?

Heywood,
51, attended the private Bootham School in York, which was run by the 
Quakers. His family were not Quakers, but his father taught English at 
the school. He won a scholarship to Oxford, studying history and 
economics, and joined the civil service after gaining a Masters in 
economics at the LSE.

It
was at the Treasury in the early 1990s that he met a youthful adviser 
to Norman Lamont named David Cameron. They have been close ever since. 
At the Treasury, he also met his wife Suzanne, a high-flyer at 
management consultants McKinsey. They have three children.

Heywood,
who is paid £190,000 and took a bonus last year despite calls for 
public sector pay restraint, lives in a £2million house in Clapham, 
South London, where he had a walk-in wine cellar built in the basement.

And
he is not averse to letting his hair down a little. Before Christmas, 
he threw a party for senior civil servants at home. As the wine flowed, 
Heywood challenged Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the Civil Service, to a
game of pool on a miniature table owned by one of his children. Heywood
was victorious.

But then this is a man who has long been used to being on the winning side, in politics as in life.

He
was hand-picked by Tony Blair to be his Private Secretary and stayed at
the Cabinet Office under Gordon Brown. After serving two Labour prime 
ministers, it was assumed that Heywood would go when David Cameron 
arrived in Downing Street. But Cameron, delighted at being reunited with
his former colleague, knighted him and promoted him to Cabinet 
Secretary.

Today, he’s
the only civil servant in the ‘Chumocracy’ – the small group of public 
school-educated men and women who are utterly loyal to Mr Cameron, and 
are cheerleaders for the modernisation of the Tory Party.

West Coast rail bid: Virgin's Richhard Branson was sure the Department for Transport's figures were wrong, but Heywood reported to the PM that they were correct- an error that will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds

Unlike his predecessors, 
Heywood has exploited his place in the privileged inner circle to stray 
deep into areas of policy. He has even banished all Tories from the 
No 10 policy unit, which is now run by civil servants. Is it any wonder 
the Government is bereft of any policies to excite the Tory faithful?

Heywood
was the driving force last year behind the move to hand control of BAE,
one of Britain’s last major manufacturers, to a European consortium. To
the astonishment of many Tories, the Prime Minister was supportive of 
the deal, which eventually collapsed.

One
minister said tartly: ‘It was bad for Great Britain PLC, and Heywood 
should have been nowhere near it.’ Not least because there was what many
regarded as a conflict of interest. The bank advising on the deal, and 
earning millions in fees, was Morgan Stanley, where Heywood had been a 
senior director for five years until 2008, having left Downing Street to
gain private sector experience.

He
was also head of the Morgan Stanley team which advised on the sale of 
the care home chain Southern Cross in 2006 to a US private equity firm. 
The deal unravelled and 3,000 jobs were lost.

Heywood’s
tentacles have even stretched to welfare, one of the few areas where 
the Government is making progress. It was leaked in the autumn that 
Heywood opposed some of Welfare Secretary Iain Duncan Smith’s flagship 
changes. The Welfare Secretary’s supporters are furious. ‘It’s a key 
area of our work and an unelected civil servant is trying to scupper 
it,’ said a friend of IDS. ‘Cameron should rein him in.’

But
he won’t, because Heywood has learned how to reinforce the PM’s natural
instincts. Indeed, so potent is the hold that the Manchester 
United-supporting mandarin has on Cameron that ministers are careful to 
whisper their criticisms.

As
one said: ‘Cameron trusts Heywood far more than his ministers.’ That 
relationship will be tested by the committee’s findings today.
