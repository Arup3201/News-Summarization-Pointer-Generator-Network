Many of us wish we could magic away that excess 10lb in an instant. If only Photoshop worked in real life. 

One talented YouTuber has released a time-lapse video of an editing session in which they shave off stones of fat from a person's appearance, ridding them of bulging cheeks and sagging, multiple chins in just a few minutes.

The four minute clip shows how simple it is to forge a photograph, and it's already been watched more than 785,000 times.

Consideration is given to the natural indentation of a defined cheekbone, and the pointed shape of a slender chin. 

The subject, Japanese television personality Matsuko Deluxe, 42, is given a radical transformation in just a few minutes.

How convincing the nips and tucks really are in creating a seamless slimmer image, though, is up for debate. 

Other videos on the realretouch YouTube channel, which has more than 5,200 subscribers, include several more slimming tutorials under the title 'Photoshop diet'.

She is quickly transformed, losing all her back rolls and cellulite to become slender yet curvy, and definitely model-worthy.

There are also celebrity ones of Susan Boyle, as well as one about how to make an image of Justin Bieber more 'manly', and how to make him into a woman.
