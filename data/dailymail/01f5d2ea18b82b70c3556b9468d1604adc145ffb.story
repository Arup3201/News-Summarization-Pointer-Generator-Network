Speaking to goal.com, Boateng said: 'We did not win and we did not play our game like we did in previous games. We are still comfortable, but we did not deserve to win against Gladbach.

'How do we move on from this loss? We will meet some Gladbach players again when we gather for the national team, but sometimes it's like that. 

'We will focus on the national team for a week. When we return, the focus is on Bayern again and we want to continue a good season.
