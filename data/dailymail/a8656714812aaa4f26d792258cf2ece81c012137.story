Swooping from the sky, all Synwell the lonely bird of prey really wants is to find a mate.

But being one of the world’s biggest and most powerful owls, with a 5ft 6in wingspan and talons like scalpels, his advances might seem a little forceful.

Woefully misguided too, as unfortunate victims of the eagle owl’s indiscriminate love bombing in a Cotswold market town can testify only too well.

Take Sue Dunn, 70, a retired nurse who ended up with a broken arm after she caught Synwell’s enormous orange eyes one night when she tried to photograph him perched on a lamppost, hooting.

Synwell the owl has been swooping down on frightened residents in Wotton-on-Edge in his search for a mate. Left, he lands on Graham Ellis in his garden and right, Sue Dunn, whose arm was broken by his wings

‘He was making such a noise, so I went outside and shone my torch on him to try to get a picture,’ she said. ‘He didn’t seem to like that. He drew his wings up and took off – flying straight at me.’

She tried to run back to her house but while dodging the bird, which stands over 2ft tall and weighs as much as a small dog, she tripped and fractured her right forearm as she broke her fall.

‘If he was being romantic, he should have gone to Specsavers. I had no time to run from him, he just dive-bombed me. He’s certainly got no fear of humans,’ she said.

It is the latest in a series of incidents in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, involving Synwell, who was named after an area of the town by locals.

Margaret Carruthers, 74, has been swooped on in the street, and her husband Robert, 66, was targeted outside their home. Mr Carruthers said: ‘We were so shocked by the incident that my wife won’t go outside the house now without taking an umbrella for defence. If he comes at you, there can be no warning.’

Despite his misadventures, Synwell has become so popular since he took up residence two years ago that residents have created a Facebook page for him to record sightings, incidents and photographs – and he has amassed 457 followers.

Of course, some can’t resist posting updates about the twit-twooer on Twitter too.

Eagle owls are found all over Europe, but are rarely seen in Britain. They have been known in captivity in this country since at least the 17th century, says the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and remain popular with falconers and collectors.

But dozens of eagle owls, which feed on small mammals but can be trained to kill foxes, escape every year. Synwell has tags on his legs and is thought to have been born in captivity before escaping or being abandoned.

Experts say that explains why he seems so eager to get to grips with humans. Jemima Parry-Jones, from the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Newent in the Forest of Dean, said: ‘Captive birds think their mother was human, so new humans are potential partners, hence it flies at them.

‘He’s not actually attacking, but he’s a big bird with dirty great talons, so it’s certainly a nerve-racking experience if he takes a sudden fancy to you.’

The centre is keen to rescue the bird, if the town approves.

But support for Synwell is so strong that even Mrs Dunn bears him no ill-feeling, although her husband Alex has bought a sonic scarer to deter him from further visits. ‘If he is looking for love, he’s certainly taking bold risks,’ she said. ‘A lot of people are concerned he might get hurt if someone takes the law into their own hands.’

For Graham and Glenys Ellis, both 67, Synwell is a welcome visitor. Mrs Ellis can even call him down by mimicking his hoots – although her husband always steps in at the last second so the owl lands on him (pictured above).

Mr Ellis said: ‘He does a little tap dance then flies off again. I’m not frightened of him, he’s beautiful.’

Others, however, have wondered what might happen if Synwell swooped on a small child. His Facebook page also contains warnings about his behaviour.

‘Do not leave the house if the owl is out! He just swooped at me as I walked down my drive,’ posted Samii Buckland. ‘Claw marks on my head!’
