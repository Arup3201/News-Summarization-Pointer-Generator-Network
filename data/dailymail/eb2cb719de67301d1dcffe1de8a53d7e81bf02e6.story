A hidden shopping mall selling fake designer goods has been discovered behind a row of derelict shops.

The secret shopping village - on a once bustling street in Manchester - is packed with fake Louis Vuitton handbags, Nike football shirts, and Jimmy Choo shoes.

Visitors to the black market in Bury New Road stock up in bulk and then sell the goods across the country.

The secret village - on a once bustling high street in Manchester - is packed with fake trainers being sold for a fraction of the price

The Sunday Mirror reports that shoppers can buy counterfeit items such as a fake Louis Vuitton satchel for £15, and Jimmy Choo shoes for £10 - well below the normal retail price.

Fake  Nike, Converse and 
Adidas trainers are sold for £25 a pair, and Mulberry, Louis Vuitton, 
Prada and Chanel all sell for well under £35.

The 20 shops reportedly operate on a 'spotter system' - whereby a lookout will stand outside the shuttered shop front and use mobile phones to alert colleagues inside if police are near.

While most of the business comes from those buying in bulk, individual shoppers also visit the underworld factory to buy fake handbags, sunglasses and sports gear.

Workers in the garage-sized shops told undercover reporters that people came to them rather than spend what little money they have on the real brands.

The goods come from China and Turkey - and those who buy in bulk then sell on items on the internet.

Business Secretary Vince Cable last week announced plans to crack down on counterfeit goods - adding that fakers account for 10 per cent of global trade.

A report has revealed the number of illegal 
website links removed worldwide in the past year has increased 
620 per cent to 72million.

Mr Cable said he had forged new links in China to help combat the problem, and Intellectual Property Minister Lord Younger added: 'The UK is a centre of excellence for intellectual property-rich companies and it is vital that we create the confidence for UK firms to grow overseas.

'Collaboration and partnership are key to that. The UK and China are working ever more closely to reduce the impact of IP crime.'
