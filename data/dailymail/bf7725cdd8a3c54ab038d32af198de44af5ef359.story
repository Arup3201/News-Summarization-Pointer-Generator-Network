A couple who regained custody of their toddler daughter after they were suspected of beating her so badly she was left with cerebral palsy now face charges in her death.

Stephanie and Frankie Williams face child
 abuse charges after their 21-month-old daughter, Anayah, passed away at the weekend - just
 three weeks after she returned to them following abuse concerns.

On Friday night, authorities responded to a report that the child was not breathing at the couple's home in Frederick, Maryland and she was later pronounced dead in hospital.

Frankie Williams, 24, told authorities he punched his daughter repeatedly while his wife was at work, according to investigators, and when his wife returned home, she did not call for help for six hours.

Charges: Frankie Williams, left, allegedly admitted to punching his 21-month-old daughter while his wife, Stephanie Williams, was at work. When she returned, she allegedly did not call for help for 6 hours

When she told her husband she needed to call 
the doctor, 'he said no because child protective services would get 
involved,' according to court documents, NBC Washington reported.

A day after her death, her father was charged with child abuse resulting in death and other offenses after the little girl was allegedly found to have marks and bruises across her body.

He 'stated he punched the victim hard, and his description of hard was hard enough to hurt an adult', according to court documents.

He also allegedly admitted to assaulting the child in 2012, leaving her with a fractured skull and rib, and admitted to beating their other daughter, who is five months old.

'Cruel': The couple had just regained custody of their daughter following earlier claims they had abused her

Despite his alleged confession, his 21-year-old wife defended her husband as she spoke to WHAG the day after his arrest.

'Whatever was going through his mind I know he wasn't in his right mind when he was doing these things,' Stephanie Williams said.

On Monday, she was charged with child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury.

It comes just weeks after the child was returned to her parents, whose other child is in foster care.

State's Attorney Charlie Smith told NBC that authorities had suspected the parents had beat Anayah after she was born in 2012 - leaving her with cerebral palsy - but could not prove it.

Smith said doctors were 'convinced that it was no accident, but we couldn't pin it on anybody'.

The parents were not charged in the early case but lost custody of their daughter and spent the next two years fighting to regain custody of her.

Following an investigation by state authorities and home visits, the couple were recently awarded full custody of the little girl.

'Hindsight's 20/20,' Smith said. 'It 
shouldn't have happened.'

Stephanie and Frankie Williams are both in jail on a $1 million bond.
