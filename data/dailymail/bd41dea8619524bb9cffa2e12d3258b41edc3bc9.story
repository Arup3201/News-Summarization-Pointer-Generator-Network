An Oklahoma City teenager was sentenced to 28 years in prison after pleading guilty to killing a man in what prosecutors have called a murder-for-hire scheme.

Michael Richardson, 19, was sentenced to 28 years in prison after pleading guilty on Monday to a second-degree murder charge in Wagoner County District Court in Wagoner, Oklahoma.

Richardson was charged in the death of 53-year-old Arthur Burney - the father of Richardson's girlfriend - last year Coweta, Oklahoma.

Convicted: Michael Richardson was sentenced to 28 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder charges

His guilty plea came out of a plea agreement with prosecutors in the case.

His body was found in a barn on his property on February 18, 2011.

Richardson reportedly told the court last year that Burney's wife Patricia offered him a sum of $6,000 to kill her husband.

During the trial, Richardson testified 
that he was picked up by Patricia Burney and her daughter in a rental 
car and was driven to the Burney home in Coweta.

Victim: Arthur Burney was killed in February 2011 by Richardson in the murder-for-hire plot

Richardson said he was instructed by 
Patricia Burney to take a .22-calibre rifle hidden behind a bedroom door 
and 'shoot Arthur Burney,' according to the Tulsa World.

He said that Patricia Burney told her daughter to 'take [him] out back for 'practice shots' on the property.

Later, Richardson reportedly hid in the barn's tack room - where saddles and bridles for horse-riding are kept - and shot Burney when he came in.

The paper reported that Richardson was never able to collect the money.

Patricia Richardson was convicted of first-degree murder in April and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

She is appealing her conviction.

The girlfriend, Michelle Burney, the daughter of the victim, was just 14 at the time of the murder. 

The Tulsa World reported that she was
taken into the custody of Oklahoma’s Office of Juvenile Affairs after 
pleading guilty to murder last year.

She had claimed that her mother 'wanted' her father dead because he had become verbally abusive 'was always mean' to her mother.
