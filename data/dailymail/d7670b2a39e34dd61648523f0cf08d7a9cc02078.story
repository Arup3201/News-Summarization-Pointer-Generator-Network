A super-fast '4G' mobile network could be available in the UK this year - but the new iPad might not work with the British network.

Phone company Everything Everywhere has submitted an application to Ofcom to use its existing 1800MHz 'slice' of mobile spectrum to deliver 4G services in the UK.

But it's a slightly different frequency to the U.S. networks the new iPad is built to work on - and it's not clear whether Apple will update its tablet to work with the UK's network.

Olaf Swantee, CEO at Everything Everywhere, said earlier this year, ¿Everything Everywhere¿s vision is to launch 4G for Britain as soon as possible.'

The new network would deliver 
broadband-style speeds across the air - allowing for mobile devices to 
deliver services uch as YouTube videos which begin playing instantly.

'The mobile phone operator Everything Everywhere has submitted an application to Ofcom to use its existing spectrum to deliver 4G services,' Ofcom said today.

'Allowing Everything Everywhere to reuse its spectrum in this way is likely to bring material benefits to consumers, including faster mobile broadband speeds.'

'It’s very important that the UK does not get left behind in the building of a new infrastructure for the digital economy,' says Everything Everywhere.

'We welcome today’s notice of 1800MHz licence variation from Ofcom, as it suggests Ofcom’s willingness to encourage the early deployment of 4G LTE .'

Other operators have four weeks to submit their views, Ofcom says.

Everything Everywhere is to run trials of the technology in Bristol and Cornwall - and says it is spending £1.4 million a year on researching 4G.

The company says that the new iPad may not work with either the 1800HMz network to launch before the end of 2012 - or Britain's upcoming 'real' 4G network.

‘Apple’s published facts on the new iPad
 suggest that the its 4G capabilities are fixed to 700MHz and 2.1GHz 
spectrum frequencies, which are the ones used in the US and Canada for 
4G connectivity. In the UK 4G has not yet launched, but when it does it 
isn’t likely to run on these frequencies anyway,' says Everything 
Everywhere.

Olaf Swantee, CEO at Everything Everywhere, said earlier this year, ‘Everything Everywhere’s vision is to launch 4G for Britain as soon as possible.

'There is a great opportunity for the UK to have the 21st Century network that it so deserves, putting the nation on a level playing field with other parts of Europe, the USA and Asia.’

The super-fast 4G aerial in the new iPad will allow users to connect to the web at near-broadband speeds - but UK users might miss out

Mobile operator Everything Everywhere has applied to use its mobile spectrum to deliver super-fast 4G services in the UK - allowing UK consumers to enjoy the new iPad to the full

Apple made much of the new device's 4G 
network connection at the device's launch last night, showing off web 
videos which played near-instantly over the LTE connection.

Rival operators in the UK do not have 
suitable spectrum to offer the service so far - and Everything 
Everywhere's network could offer UK consumers their first 'taste' of a 
technology widely available in the U.S.

Apple's iPad will be one of the only devices compatible with the technology if Everything Everywhere launch.

The network is already running trials in Bristol and Cornwall.
