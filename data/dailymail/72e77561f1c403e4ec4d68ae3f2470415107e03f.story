The last Briton: Guantanamo prisoner Shaker Aamer with two of his children, son Michael and daughter Johninh - he has yet to meet his youngest son who was born after his arrests in 2001

Scotland Yard is investigating claims that MI6 and MI5 officers who interrogated a British man held at Guantanamo Bay were fully aware he was being brutally tortured by his American jailers.

Shaker Aamer, 46, whose wife and four children live in South London, alleges that during his ten years of captivity at the US naval base, British agents visited him three times.

Mr Aamer’s British lawyers have handed detectives 56 pages of hand-written notes and typed depositions in which he lays out his allegations. The Mail on Sunday has been told that Scotland Yard has formally asked the US government to allow them to question Mr Aamer in Guantanamo.

Last night the Metropolitan Police would confirm only that their investigations into Mr Aamer’s case were ongoing.

Mr Aamer, the last British detainee still held at Guantanamo, came to the UK from Saudi Arabia in 1996. In 2001, he took his family to Afghanistan to work with Islamic charities. But the CIA alleges that he was a member of Al Qaeda who was known to Osama Bin Laden.

When the American-led forces invaded Afghanistan later that year, Mr Aamer was picked up by a local militia and handed over to US troops. He was detained for three months at the US-run Bagram airbase and an American prison in Kandahar before being flown to Guantanamo.

Scotland Yard is already investigating claims that he was tortured in Afghanistan, and British interrogators working for MI6 or MI5 were present.

Specifically he alleges one British officer watched while US soldiers banged his head against a wall.

Now Mr Aamer’s written statements, declassified by the US authorities last month, reveal that he continues to suffer appalling abuse at the infamous detention facility. He says that as recently as April he was beaten up by camp guards for refusing to return to his cell where he is held for 22 hours a day.

And he further alleges that the Americans are trying to kill him through ‘medical neglect’. Mr Aamer faces no charges of terrorism and was cleared for release from Guantanamo in 2007 by the then President, George  W. Bush.

Foreign Secretary William Hague says 
the British Government is negotiating with the US for his return to live
 in the UK. His lawyers believe that the reason he has not been freed is
 that both countries have much to lose by letting him make public his 
damaging allegations of torture.

The
 declassified documents appear to show that despite his innocent status,
 the abuses have continued since the first day he was detained  in 
Afghanistan.

In his graphic accounts of his torture at Bagram, he details how he was subjected to the medieval abuse known as the ‘strappado’, devised by the Spanish Inquisition.

‘The US soldiers,’ says Mr Aamer, ‘would tie my wrists together and then hang me with either my feet just touching the ground or even just off the ground. This would gradually result in the dislocation of the shoulders in a way that was excruciating.

‘This would be done particularly when one of the soldiers thought that one of the prisoners had been talking in the cages.’

Significantly, Mr Aamer alleges that British intelligence continued to interrogate him after he was taken from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, when UK spy chiefs were fully aware of the tortures being carried out there.

He alleges he was interrogated by 
British officers in late 2002 or early 2003, including a man who was 5ft
 10in with reddish hair who spoke some Arabic. He claims the officer 
apologised to him for the treatment he had suffered at the hands of the 
Americans. Mr Aamer said: ‘He said, “I’m sorry about what [the 
Americans] have done to you.” It was clear he knew what I have been 
through, and was still going through.’

He was interrogated by the British again in 2003 but gives no more details, according to the documents.

Then
 in late 2003, he was visited for a third time, this time by a woman and
 a man. He described the woman as around 25, brunette, 5ft 4ins tall and
 ‘slender’. He said the man was ‘stocky’ and ‘squinted when he spoke’.

He says they refused to stop the torture and ‘told me they could not help’. He remembers that the male MI6 or MI5 officer interrogated him about Babar Ahmed, the British citizen who, with radical preacher Abu Hamza, on Friday lost his legal battle against extradition to America.

A few months after Mr Aamer was questioned in Guantanamo about Ahmed, he was arrested in London on the instructions of the Americans  in relation to charges of providing material support to terrorism.

The declassified papers raise serious concerns about Mr Aamer’s continuing torture and the effect this is having on his health.

His lawyer Clive Stafford Smith, legal director of the human rights charity Reprieve, visited his client  in Guantanamo as recently as last month and says his injuries and ill-health are consistent with beatings and inhumane treatment.

In July last year, Mr Aamer, known among the guards as ‘the professor’ because of his knowledge of the Guantanamo rules, began one of his many hunger strikes.

On July 20, he reports: ‘The authorities told us, “You’ll have a beautiful Ramadan.” It was in Camp 5, and they said there would be no showers, and no recreation.

‘They tortured another guy using the nose tube, until he cried. They kept him on a stretcher, with a slow drip on the feed. I banged on the door when this was happening, then fainted from my own lack of eating. I was taken to hospital.’

He says that between December 3, 2011, and January 27 this year, he was beaten up every day by guards dressed in black body armour and masks who charged into his cell and dragged him into the corridor.

He said: ‘Earlier this year I was thrown on my head by the guards, and one then jumped and landed with his knee on my rib. Both injuries caused me a great deal of pain. I was told that the X-ray showed nothing, but the doctor assured me that I would have a CT scan. That was not done.’

Visits by his lawyers are usually 
followed by beatings. He says: ‘Last time Cori Crider [a Reprieve 
lawyer] came to see me I got beaten up when she left. The same happened 
with recent visits from both David Remes and Ramzi Kassem [his US 
lawyers].’

Inquiry: Shaker Aamer's claims of abuse and torture by U.S. soldiers has led to Scotland Yard asking for permission to question him in Guantanamo

Mr Aamer says the Americans have shown him a letter written by a Foreign Office official which shows how Britain is conspiring to send him to Saudi Arabia where he will be imprisoned and separated from his family.

He adds: ‘This proves one of two possible things: first, that the UK has been discussing me with the Saudis, which would be intolerable, since Saudi Arabia is the country that has denied me the right to have a family life, and has told me that I will be jailed if I return there.

‘Alternatively, the letter proves that the UK and the US have been discussing my future based on their own discussions with Saudi Arabia – again reflecting negotiations with the Saudis, and meaning that the numbers of conspirators rises from two to three.’

According to Mr Aamer’s evidence, Saudi officials visited him as recently as February 8. He recalls: ‘They said, “When you are brought back to Saudi Arabia, you’ll be interrogated, be tried, and you’ll be jailed. Then you’ll be put in the rehabilitation programme.” They wanted me to sign a commitment that I should go to jail when I went back to Saudi Arabia. They then wanted me, once they let me out of jail at some uncertain date, to agree to go through their “rehabilitation” programme.

‘I have never been charged with any crime anywhere –  my only encounter with the British police was when I had my mobile phone stolen.’

Scotland Yard is investigating Mr Aamer’s allegations of torture which he believes will prove that MI5 and MI6 officers were sent to Afghanistan and Guantanamo to interrogate inmates with the knowledge of British Ministers.

In the documents, he says: ‘I am very happy to speak with the Metropolitan Police and help them in any way I can in their honest investigation of my torture and the torture  of others.

‘My own claims of torture  are urgent, since my abuse continues. I ask that the Met come to interview me as soon as possible. I try to speak out about my abuse here to the authorities, and consequently I get abused further.’

He adds: ‘I have been denied the right to stage a peaceful protest (a sit-in) against what has happened to me; indeed, almost every day for a year I refused to come back off the rec yard unless I was allowed to conduct my peaceful protest, and each time I refused I was ERF’d (when the Emergency Reaction Force comes and straps me to a stretcher and carries me bodily back to the cell).

‘Sometimes I have been beaten during this process; always I have been forced.’

Mr Aamer, who has never seen his youngest son who  was born after his capture in Afghanistan, says his only desire is to be reunited with his family in London.

In one desperate note to the British Government, he writes: ‘Detainee 239 need to go back to wife and kids in Britain and the British Government has no objection to take. So you need to work fast and get me out of here before it is too late.’

The Foreign Office declined to comment on the claims.
