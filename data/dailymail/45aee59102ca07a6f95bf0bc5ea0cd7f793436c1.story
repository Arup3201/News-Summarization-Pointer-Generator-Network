Naomi Kizhner's innovative jewellery isn't for the faint hearted.

Her decorative designs have a dual purpose and come complete with spikes at each end, which are inserted into the wearer's veins and are able to convert kinetic power from the body's involuntary movements into electricity.

The continuous flow of blood turns the golden wheel inside the design, eventually creating enough kinetic energy to produce electricity.

Bizarre: Israeli artist Naomi Kizhner's innovative jewellery designs  come complete with spikes on each end which insert into the wearer's veins and convert kinetic power from the body into electricity

Would YOU wear it? Naomi Kizhner's innovative jewellery designs aren't for the faint hearted - they come with spikes to attach to your body so that your blood flow can create enough kinetic which is then turned into electrical power

The collection, which is called Energy Addicts, features three designs. The Blood Bridge can be inserted into the veins of your lower arm.

Another piece, named The Blinker, fits onto the bridge of the nose and harnesses the energy created while blinking.

When the wearer blinks, there's an increased flow of blood to the area around the eyes and her statement gold jewellery collects that energy, which, she says, can be used to light up an LED or charge your mobile devices.

Quirky: The Blinker, which can be fitted onto the bridge of your nose, is one of her more painful looking designs - although she insists they don't hurt

Ouch! The collection, which is called Energy Addicts, features three designs, the first is aptly named Blood Bridge, which can be inserted into the veins on your lower arm

Intrigued: Speaking about her range, she said: 'In our modern life, energy is everything, it's the force that drives economies globally, many times disregarding the consequences'

Sharp ends: Our continuous flow of blood turns the golden wheel that's fitted inside the design, eventually creating enough kinetic energy to create electrical power

Quite the accessory! The Israeli artist explains that the project seeks to deal with questions such as 'what will be the nature of society that is based on biological wealth?'

Homework: The Israeli artist created the pieces as part of her graduation project at Jerusalem’s Hadassah College

Another, the E-pulse Conductor, is designed to be fitted on the top of your back, collecting energy from your spinal cord nerves.

The Israeli artist, who created the pieces as part of her graduation project at Jerusalem’s Hadassah College, explains that the project seeks to deal with questions such as; what will be the nature of society that is based on biological wealth and also address how we, as humans, can become a natural resource.

She said: 'In our modern life, energy is everything, it's the force that drives economies globally, many times disregarding the consequences.'
