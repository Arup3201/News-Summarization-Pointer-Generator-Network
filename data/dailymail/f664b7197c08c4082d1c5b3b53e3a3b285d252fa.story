They used to hang a banner behind the goal at the Santiago Bernabeu during matches between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid: ‘Wanted: worthy rival for a decent derby’.

It was a reference from Real Madrid fans to 14 years of steamrollering their city neighbours in embarrassingly one-sided derbies. Things changed when Diego Simeone turned up.

Atletico ended that run of not being able to beat Real in 2013 and they did it in style, winning the Spanish Cup, with Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois getting the better of Jose Mourinho in practically his last game in charge at the  Bernabeu.

REAL MADRID: Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Nacho, Coentrao; Khedira, Kroos, Isco; Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo

The ‘other’ club in the Spanish capital have not looked back since. Atletico have already faced Real five times this season and Carlo Ancelotti’s side are yet to come out on top in the derby that has suddenly become one of Europe’s most fiercely contested again.

There are just 10 miles between Real Madrid’s stadium and Atletico’s Vicente Calderon. There are also 10 European Cups between the two clubs but that didn’t stop Simeone’s underdogs winning La Liga last season.

There was a brief return to the old form book at the Champions League final in Lisbon when Atletico were within seconds of winning only for Sergio Ramos to head in a corner and Real to romp home in extra time. ‘

'Normal business’, however, has not been restored. Atletico are one of the most difficult sides to beat in Europe and no-one tests Real more. Cristiano Ronaldo and Co, having already overcome Barca this season at the Bernabeu, were beaten by goals from Arda Turan and Tiago either side of a Ronaldo penalty last September when Atletico visited.

On Saturday, Madrid will once again be split. Atletico’s stadium was not expected to host too many more derbies with a new ground outside of the city planned to be opened at the end of next season but, with work on it currently stalled, there is a feeling that the old area on the banks of the Manzanares river has some life in it yet. On Saturday, with Simeone conducting the masses, the atmosphere will be as good as a neutral will find anywhere in Spain.

When they were relegated to the second division in 2000, Atletico Madrid had 20,000 season-ticket holders. At the start of the following season in the second division they had 45,000 season-ticket holders committed to supporting the club’s attempt to win promotion. That passion has always been there and Simone - a former double-winning player at the club - has tapped into it.

Atletico just need to make sure the excitement doesn’t get the better of them. They lost their heads against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey last week with Gabi sent off at half-time, Mario Suarez joining him in the second half and coach Simeone and Arda Turan lucky not to pick up reds too. On Saturday they must keep their heads without losing that killer instinct that has seen them become Real’s worst nightmare so far this season.

Managers

It’s Mr Cool and Mr Motivator. Carlo Ancelotti has fared badly against his former Serie A rival since he turned up in Spain.

The two contrasting styles will be in evidence again on the touchline. Ancelotti might allow himself a couple of extra chewing gums to help deal with the tension; Simeone will be in emotional overdrive from the first kick.

It would be harsh on him to just call it tub-thumping heart-on-the-sleeve stuff however. He has been the shrewd tactician in these matches too smothering Madrid’s play-makers Isco and James Rodriguez.

Players

There will be no James Rodriguez because of a broken bone in his foot and perhaps more importantly Real Madrid will be without both first-choice central defenders Pepe and Sergio Ramos.

There could also be no Marcelo pending a final-hour attempt to over-turn his suspension.

What Real do have in their favour is the return of Ronaldo. The birthday boy, who celebrated 30 years this week, has missed the last two games and will be desperate to get back among the goals in what has so far been a disappointing 2015.

Atletico Madrid look set to field Mario Mandjukic and Antoine Griezmann in attack at the expense of Fernando Torres, although having scored in the first minute against both Real and Barca this season, Simeone will be tempted to start with El Nino - who has netted twice against the old enemy since his return to the club.

Tactics

Without Rodriguez in midfield Carlo Ancelotti will revert to a 4-3-3 with Sami Khedira keeping Toni Kroos and Isco company and the BBC front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano in attack.

Ronaldo has a superb record against Atletico Madrid, scoring 15 goals against them in 19 matches.

They will look to suck the home side in and hit them on the counter attack but Atletico are not a team to be pulled where the opposition want them to go. They won’t be fooled into playing high up the pitch against the speed of Bale and Ronaldo. They will stay compact and look to utilise their efficiency from set pieces where captain Diego Godin and Koke will be vital as always.

Ronaldo, scoring in November 2011, has netted 15 goals in 19 matches against Real's rivals Atletico

Form/Prediction

Both sides are wobbling. Real have not been the same since they won the World Club Cup. They lost the first league game of the new year against Valencia and then they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atletico. Ronaldo has been given a red card and Gareth Bale has been given abuse by his own supporters for not passing the ball.

Atletico are not in a much better state. They were then dumped out of the Copa del Rey by Barcelona losing their nerve in the process. In the meantime Barcelona have gone from strength to strength. That makes it even more vital that both sides win.

Prediction: Neither will win. A score draw giving the Catalans who play Sunday against Athletic Bilbao a great chance to take advantage.
