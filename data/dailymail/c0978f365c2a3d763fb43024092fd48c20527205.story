A range of child restraints that trap youngsters to prevent them from moving has appeared in toy stores in Brazil.

The brightly coloured collection includes the Baby Trap Chair; a high chair with wrist and ankle manacles with the tagline 'The end of suffering at meal times'.

The Happy Heavy Ball is a simple ball and chain for the ankle, albeit coloured bright orange and with a smiley face on the ball. It claims 'No more running around the house'.

And the Lovely Straight Jacket, which is exactly as described and suits both tearaway boys and girls, offers to 'keep your children's hands away from your home's beautiful and expensive decoration'.Â

The toys might seem a harsh way to discipline unruly offspring, and in fact the 'Control Toys' were only created to promote the Brazilian version of the Super Nanny TV show.

But that didn't stop visitors to a toy shop being fooled by the seemingly real display of traps for toddlers.

A hilarious video shows parents reacting with horror when they realise what the cheerful boxes contained.

The cheery products are aimed at boys and girls aged 3plus

Copywriter Luis Felipe Figueiredo 
helped create the successful ads with Antonio Correa, Art Director for 
Sao Paulo advertising agency Publicis.

Luis
explains: 'The inspiration for the campaign came from TV show itself. 
By watching it, we realised that most of those kids seemed like little 
devils. They were completely out of control as if they were possessed.

'So we put ourselves in parent's place for a minute thinking what we could do to control them and the idea came as a joke. Then we thought, well it's a joke but maybe it's what we need to get their attention. In fact, we even bet that some parents would consider the possibility of buying those crazy toys. Also, it couldn't have a better place to talk to that target than toy stores.'The campaign became TV spots, where we pretended to be selling those products and also print ads with the same approach. Then the packages were placed in the stores of one of the biggest toy store chains in Brazil, where we got those reactions on the video.'In the end, Super Nanny TV show ratings were a lot beyond than expected, making the client really happy with the results. But most importantly, it showed that sometimes to sell a product, a service or a TV show, betting on daring ideas indeed works.'
