A two-year-old girl with a rare nerve disorder is unable to take a potentially life-changing drug because the government shutdown means her clinical trial has been put on hold.

Heidi and Greg MacCurtain, from Plymouth, Massachusetts, expressed their anger that their daughter Abby is being barred from a better quality of life simply because the government is 'not getting along'.

The little girl, who is unable to sit or walk and relies on a feeding tube for seven hours a day, suffers from Leigh's disease, a rare incurable disease that affects the central nervous system and causes seizures and the loss of motor skills.

Victim: Abby MacCurtain (pictured with her mother Heidi), who suffers from a rare nerve disorder, is unable to take part in a clinical trial because it has been halted by the government shutdown

She was scheduled to begin a new clinical trial last week of the EPI-743 drug at the National Institute. The trial has already been carried out on Italian patients and improvement in function was noted.

But nearly three-quarters of workers at the NIH have been furloughed due to the government shutdown, which began at midnight last Monday, and new trials have been put on hold.

'We were angry,' her father Greg told NBC Nightly News. 'Angry for my daughter. And how can they not get along to make this work?'

Her mother Heidi added: 'I want to give her the best, and having the EPI-743 so close to our hands and ripped away is unimaginable.'

Hope on hold: Abby's parents said the drug would greatly improve the quality of her life. The condition, Leigh's Disease, means the two-year-old is unable to sit up or walk and is prone to seizures

Fears: Greg and Heidi MacCurtain said they are exasperated that the government is unable to get on

Concerns: All they can do is search for privately-funded trials that may help their daughter

The NIH enrolls around 200 patients a 
week for new trials, including 30 children - but all must now wait until
the government opens again.

For now, all the MacCurtain family can do is wait for privately-funded clinical trials.

'We won't stop at anything until we get her on the treatment that she needs and deserves,' her father said.

There have been other stories across the country of crucial clinical trials being put on hold due to the shutdown.

Eight-year-old Maddie Major, a leukemia patient from Baltimore, is also in limbo because the clinial trial she needs cannot be approved by the FDA, as it has also been shut down.

Closed: Only essential employees can work during the shutdown, and around 75% of National Institute of Health workers have been furlough. Here, the World War Veterans Park in Staten Island, New York

Her mother, Robyn, told CBS: 'I am completely blown away by how callous and how carelessly theyâ€™ve just kind of used us as their pawns to push their own agenda.'

Of the 200 patients beginning trials, around 10 are cancer patients.

Those already enrolled in clinical trials will still receive care.

A partial shut down of the government began for the first time in 17 years on October 1, after a partisan stalemate over health insurance reform in Congress blocked the budgeting process.
