Taylor Swift has won hundreds of awards, but she'll likely never forget her 2009 Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards.

Rapper Kanye West rushed the stage, stealing the microphone from the unsuspecting singer and insisting fellow nominee Beyonce had 'one of the best videos of all time.'

However, six years later the two seemed chummy as they posed backstage at the 57th Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.

Reconciled: It looks like all is good between Kanye West (L) and Taylor Swift (R) after the former infamously interrupted the singer's MTV VMA acceptance speech

Bad Blood: Taylor was taken by surprise when Kanye rushed the stage back in 2009 when she won Best Female Video

In one shot, the unlikely duo appear to be engaged in a handshake, as they both sport wide grins, which is also unusual for Kanye.

The pair were also spotted posing together, standing close as both sported large smiles for the cameras.

This comes as a surprise after the shocking interruption that threw off the Blank Space singer's 2009 VMA acceptance speech.

Bury the hatchet? It seems Taylor may have made a new famous friend after Sunday's Grammy ceremony

Taylor Swift was clearly having a fantastic time at the Grammys last night as she danced up a storm. Shake it off and all that!

And we give her credit for busting some moves because her dress wasn't exactly the most conducive to getting down! The pop starlet chose a dramatic gown by Elie Saab for the awards show and while we love the combined mini and maxi cut, it wasn't the most practical of looks.

The teal fabric is just beautiful and has an iridescence that really makes an impact. Plus those pink Giuseppe Zanotti heels are a genius touch of styling. Well played Taylor. Teal and turquoise can sometimes be tricky to pull off but it just requires taking the time to find out the right shade for you.

So why not give it a go at your next black tie event? It will certainly make a change from all the black and you'll be sure to turn heads. So start your search with our edit below. We love Stylestalker's slinky dress at Asos or splash some serious cash on Marchesa at Farfetch.

After it was announced that Taylor had one Best Female Video for You Belong With Me, Kanye West rushed the stage to denounce her victory over close friend Beyonce.

Taylor began her acceptance speech for the coveted award, saying: 'Thank you so much! I always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these some day, but I never actually thought it would have happened. I sing country music so thank you so much for giving me a chance to win a VMA award.'

However, she was quickly interrupted by Kanye, who said: 'Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé has one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time.'

Surprise appearance: Kayne ran onto stage to protest Taylor's win, insisting that Beyonce's video was 'one of the best videos of all time'

Shocked: The 1989 hitmaker was speechless after the rapper stole her microphone at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony

He was referencing Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It) which was also nominated in the category. However, the mortified look on Beyonce's face seemed to hint she didn't share his opinion of Taylor's win.

She later invited Taylor onstage to give a proper acceptance speech when she won the award for Video of the Year.

However, it appears the bad blood between the two artists is in the past, as they posed playfully at the 2015 Grammy ceremony.

Working things out: Perhaps Taylor wanted to amend her issues with Kanye upon growing discussion of her feud with Katy Perry

Meeting the family: The songstress also took time to chat with Kanye's wife, reality star Kim Kardashian

Playing mediator? (L to R) Taylor's new pal Jay Z could also have played a hand in she and Kanye - pictured here with with Kim - resolving their issues

But even though he made his peace with Taylor, the rapper still showed a bit of a naughty streak as he recreated his 2009 VMA moment by running the stage following Beck's win for Album of the Year for Morning Phase.

The artist beat out Beyonce's self-titled album, and for a moment it looked as if Kayne was going steal another microphone, but he quickly changed his mind and returned to his seat. 

At the awards show Taylor was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year - which both went to Sam Smith - and Best Pop Solo Performance - which went to Pharrell. 

She did take the stage to introduce pal Sam Smith's performance, as well as to present his victory in the category of Best New Artist.

Kanye was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration - which he lost to Eminem and Rihanna - and Best Rap Song - which he lost to Kendrick Lamar. 

He also performed at the event, returning to the Grammy stage for the first time in six years for both his single Only One, and his collaboration with Paul McCartney and Rihanna, FourFiveSeconds.

Deja vu? Kanye almost repeated his 2009 moment, as he rushed the stage following Beck's win for Album of the Year, but quickly changed his mind and returned to his seat

Thrilled: Taylor was elated to present the award for Best New Artist to her pal Sam Smith
