In Burger King's advert an actor holds a microphone and a box of nuggets and aggressively asks two teenagers on the street 'How much do you think these chicken nuggets are?' 

Since his original tweet to his 238,000 followers Eichner has been inundated with support 

After they guess 'five dollars' he shouts the real price at them in an animated fashion.

Eichner's sketch 'Billy on the Street' sees him chase New Yorkshire down the street before forcefully asking them questions. 

One example sees him thrusting a mic into a woman's faces as he quizzes her: 'What do you watch, miss?'

On hearing a woman's response he yelps and cries out before running down the street.

Since his original tweet to his 238,000 followers Eichner has been inundated with support from other users.

Fellow comedian Seth Rogen tweeted: 'Yo @BurgerKing, stop stealing from the hilarious @billyeichner and stick to what you're good at: giving me diarrhea.' 

Michael Ian Black tweeted 'Hey @burgerking, you were stupid if you think hiring some random actor to rip off @billyeichner was going to work. I WAS AVAILABLE!!!'

Eventually Eichner wrote: 'As annoying as it is to have Burger King rip me off, your tweets are incredible. I have the BEST fans on the planet!!! See u at McDonalds!'
