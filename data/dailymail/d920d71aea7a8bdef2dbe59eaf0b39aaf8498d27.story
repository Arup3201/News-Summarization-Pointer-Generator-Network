A man who was discovered in a snowdrift in the Norwegian capital Oslo has emerged from a coma to reveal he speaks perfect English but has no idea who he is or where he comes from.

The mystery man, who calls himself John Smith but does not know his real name, was found with a cocktail of drugs in his system and cuts on his wrist suggesting they had been strapped.

He said he is not Norwegian but may be Czech as that is the language he understands best. He also understands Slovak, Polish and Russian and speaks with a heavy Russian accent.

Mystery man: Police have released a picture of a man who was discovered in a snowdrift in December last year and awoke from a coma with no idea who he was or where he comes from

He told Norway's NRK channel: 'The cuts were deep and it took several months before the wounds 
healed. It was quite obvious that my hands had been tied 
together.

'I was paralyzed and could not speak. But the doctor said it was different drugs in the system. I'm desperate, scared and want nothing more than to get out of this 
situation.

'I think I'm Czech, it is the language I 
understand best. I also understand Polish, Slovak and 
Russian. But I think and dream in English.'

The man was discovered by a passerby in a snowdrift in an industrial part of Oslo  on December 15th. He spent three days in a coma before coming round.

Police took fingerprints and released his picture to Interpol, but so far investigations have drawn a blank.

He added: 'At least I know I can't be a criminal, although I almost wish I was. Then they would have found out who I was.

'I
 woke up with a nurse beside me, and as I did not understand, I asked 
her to speak to me in English. I remembered nothing. It was so funny 
when she asked what my name was and then I couldn't remember it.'

Oslo police say his case is being handled by their violence and sexual crimes branch.

A
 spokesman said: 'The man did not possess any form of identification, 
and did not remember his name, origin, how he ended up in Norway or any 
other details of his life.

'He
 is of European origin, speaks very good English with an 
Eastern/Central-European accent, and understands Czech, Slovak, Polish 
and Russian languages.

'He is 187 cm [6.1 ft] tall, has blue eyes and dark blonde hair.'
