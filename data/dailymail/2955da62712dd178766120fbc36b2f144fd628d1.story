President Barack Obama today urged Americans not to succumb to hysteria over Ebola, warning that travel restrictions between the U.S. and West Africa could 'make the situation worse'.

Speaking in his weekly radio and internet address, Obama told listeners: 'Trying to seal off an entire region of the world - if that were even possible - could actually make the situation worse,'

He added: 'This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. We have to be guided by the science.'

It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Most of these cases have been reported in West Africa.

Although lawmakers had previously cited a travel ban as a common-sense step to prevent more people with Ebola from entering the U.S., Obama defended his decision.

He argued that far from combating the spread of the deadly virus, such a ban would only hamper aid efforts and screening measures. 

Instead, he said defeating Ebola, which has mainly affected Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, would require a joint effort between citizens, government leaders and the media.

On Friday, growing concern about Ebola and the three cases diagnosed so far in Dallas prompted Obama to tap former top White House adviser Ron Klain to be his point person on the virus.

Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S., died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on October 8.

Since then, two nurses who cared for him - Nina Pham, 26, and 29-year-old Amber Vinson - have been found to have the virus.

Striking a careful balance, Obama said today there is no 'outbreak' or 'epidemic' of Ebola in the U.S., but even one case is too many.

'Fighting this disease will take time,' he said. 'Before this is over, we may see more isolated cases here in America. But we know how to wage this fight.'

As Obama sought to reassure anxious Americans, U.S. officials were still working to contain the fallout and potential routes of infection from the Ebola cases identified in the country. so far. 

The president said he was 'absolutely confident' the U.S. could prevent a serious outbreak at home - if it continues to elevate facts over fear.

Yesterday, it was revealed that nearly 100 lawmakers are in favor of placing travel restrictions in order to decrease the odds that someone who is infected with Ebola will be able to enter the U.S.

At least 80 members of the House and 20 senators have said they would like the president ban flights that have carrying passengers coming out of West Africa or temporarily rescind the visas of residents of Ebola stricken nations.

The White House said on Friday that if the president believed such a move would be in the interest of the public's safety, 'he wouldn't hesitate to do that.'

Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.

Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.
