CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report of Arsenal's impressive victory at the Etihad Stadium.

At some point in the near future we will have to ask whether honesty is the preserve of the English game or whether we are done with beating the integrity drum.

The 24th minute at the Etihad, when Nacho Monreal brushed against Vincent Kompany to prompt a slow-motion collapse inside the penalty area, seems a good place to start.

Arsenal’s left back looked like a sky diver, using the friction of Kompany’s body to launch himself into the night air and executing a safe landing with some cushioned rolls. It was tempting to applaud the audacity.

So did Monreal dive? The answer is that we will never really know for sure, but even Arsene Wenger admitted that this one went their way.

If the defender did, can you blame him? Based on everything else that goes on each week at every other stadium, then probably not. Mike Dean, bless him, bought it because at speed and without the benefit of an assistant referee or a fourth official with enough gumption to give him some guidance, he will be at ease with himself.

‘I’ve always said that referees need help and guidance in these situations because they have to make an instant decision,’ admitted Arsenal’s manager.

Wenger was pretty gracious about it, accepting that the decision to award a penalty, converted by Santi Cazorla, turned in Arsenal’s favour on this occasion. Manuel Pellegrini knew it too.

‘The movement of Kompany allows him to dive,’ claimed Manchester City’s manager. ‘I am not saying it was a bad mistake of the referee, but the penalty changed the game and was not the reason we lost.’ He is spot on, there. Arsenal played at a different tempo to City and deserved to win here. For those who worry about the games that go on out there between players in the heat of battle, then the incident between Monreal and City’s captain is perfect fodder.

The stakes were unusually high, amplified by the fact that Arsenal’s immediate rivals for a place in the Champions League - Manchester United, Tottenham and Southampton - all won on Saturday.

Arsene Wenger’s team were under pressure, particularly as anyone outside N7 expected this lot to be swatted aside at the home of the champions.

There were demands on Manchester City too and there was an anticipation that they would match Chelsea’s performance at the Liberty Stadium, where they beat Swansea City 5-0, with a convincing win. Take nothing away from Arsenal’s work-rate and application because Wenger’s team, with the excellent Olivier Giroud spearheading their attack, did a number on City. They did a proper job on them.

Giroud deserved his goal, flinging himself at Cazorla’s free-kick in the 67th minute free-kick to increase Arsenal’s advantage. This is a very good win. Beyond that is the bigger picture, the bone of contention that leaves a TV audience all over the world wondering whether Dean has been had over by some clever improvisation.

The incident was not the classic trip, the outstretched leg or the clattering challenge that forces a referee to make a decision based on the aggression or the severity of the injury.

These are the issues Dennis Bergkamp address in his brilliant autobiography Stillness and Speed, where he admits that he would exaggerate the impact to draw attention to a foul.

The Arsenal No 10 was forced to change his ways, under pressure from a dressing room that included the likes of Tony Adams, Steve Bould, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon. They just did things a certain way back then.

Monreal’s fall was much cuter, a subtle form of the game that has crept in to English football over the past few seasons.

They are all at it these days and it was only last week that Chelsea’s assistant manager Steve Holland hinted that Eden Hazard had been forced to master the craft of winning free-kicks in opposition territory.

What a sad indictment of the modern game, a tacit acceptance that the players are calling the tune these days.

Putting that to one side, Arsenal’s win was as clean as they come.
