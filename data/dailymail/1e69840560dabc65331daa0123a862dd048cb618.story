PSG midfielder Yohan Cabaye has admitted he is 'not happy' with his bit-part role in the French champions' side under Laurent Blanc.

The former Newcastle United man, who moved to Ligue 1 last January for £19million, played just 15 minutes of the 1-1 draw with Monaco at the weekend, and hasn't been at the forefront of Blanc's mind.

Cabaye has had to settle for the bench on a few occassions this season, and with PSG struggling for form with three league wins all season, the French international says he is not used to being left out.

He told L'Equipe: 'You have to accept being a substitute, but I don't resign myself to that. In training sessions, I have to give my best and show my desire to play.

'When I am on the pitch, I feel it is not perfect and that I often have to leave too soon. But I know the coach and staff have to make choices and I respect that.

'Have I spoken to Laurent Blanc? No. What do I tell him? I am 28 years old and not new to the job. But I am not satisfied with the situation.

'Am I completely happy? To be honest, no. It is a new situation for me, but I don't complain. It is the first time I haven't played regularly for my club.

'With the French team, if one day the national team coach decides to play me less because I don't play often enough for my club, then I would need to take stock with my representatives.'

Cabaye could be back in the Premier League by January, having left Newcastle 10 months ago

With Cabaye suggesting he is unhappy in Paris, a host of Premier League clubs will be on alert in an attempt to prise him away in January. Arsenal were thought to be heavily interested in Cabaye before he left for PSG.

He said: 'Do I sometimes miss England? Yes. Sometimes I think about it, but I immediately sweep that away because it would cause distraction.

'I am at the Parc des Princes and I need to find the right atmosphere.'

Many Newcastle fans will have predicted this outcome when their star midfielder left St James' Park, while Cabaye will assume his price tag alone will have secured him a more regular place in the team.

Cabaye came on in the 71st minute of the famous 3-2 win over Barcelona last week, and endured a torrid start to the campaign after being sent off in the 0-0 draw at Evian in August.

Cabaye played 21 games for the club last season, scoring just once.
