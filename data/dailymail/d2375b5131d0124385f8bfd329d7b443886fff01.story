Revelation: In a letter Joseph Heller wrote that his experience of combat was in direct contrast to his central character of John Yossatian, and that he actually enjoyed it

He may have written one of the anti-conflict classics - but it has now been revealed that Catch-22 author Joseph Heller actually enjoyed his military service during the second world war.

In a letter to an academic preparing a collection of essays about his satirical 1961 novel, he wrote that his experience of combat was in direct contrast to his central character of John Yossarian.

Writing to James Nagel, English professor at Northeastern University in Boston: 'How did I feel about the war when I was in it?

'Much differently than Yossarian felt and
much differently than I felt when I wrote the novel … In truth I 
enjoyed it and so did just about everyone else I served with, in 
training and even in combat.

'I was young, it was adventurous, there was much hoopla and glamour.

'In addition, and this too is hard to get across to college students today, for me and for most others, going into the army resulted immediately in a vast improvement in my standard of living.'

The three-page-long typed letter, which is due to be auctioned in the U.S., was written in 1974 and reveals he made $65 to $75 a month while in the military.

This was more than the $60 he received as a filing clerk and he said that 'all food, lodging, clothing and medical expenses paid'.

Transformation: Catch-22 was later made into a film, released in 1970, starring Alan Arkin (pictured) as Captain Yossarian

He added: 'There was the prospect of travel and a general feeling of a more exciting and eventful period ahead … more freedom than I enjoyed in the long years afterwards.'

Aged 19, Heller joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and then served, just like his book's protagonist, on the Italian front.

He flew 60 combat missions as a B25 bombardier.

He then spent much of the 1950s writing the book.

Publisher Simon & Schuster granted him a book deal based on the contents of the first chapter.

In the letter he added: 'I knew [the book] would be published. I knew I worked slowly.

'I took my time and tried to make it the best book I could possibly write on that subject at that time.'

Two of the letters to Nagel will be auctioned by Nate D Sanders online auction house over the next two weeks.

They are expected to fetch between $2,000 and $3,000.

Catch-22 was later made into a film, released in 1970, with Alan Arkin as Captain Yossarian. Jon Voight and Orson Welles also starred.

Heller, who was made a millionaire by the film, went on to write Something Happened, Good as Gold and Picture This.

Born on May 1, 1923, in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, he was the son of poor Russian Jewish parents Lena and Isaac.

He died of a heart attack on December 12, 1999 at his East Hampton home.

After his death, publishers Simon & Schuster released his final work, called A Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man. It was a collection of his memoirs and essays.
