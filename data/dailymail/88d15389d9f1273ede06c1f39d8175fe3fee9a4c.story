These furry fashionistas give new meaning to the term 'doggy bag' as they model the latest in canine couture.

The fashion line, which includes bags and harnesses, is the work of Miami-based model-turned-designer Kiki Hamann.

Kiki started the range after looking for a bag for her Chihuahua - and failing to find anything sufficiently stylish or fashionable.

The fancy harnesses can either be draped around the front or back depending on your pooch's preferred view

The Brazilian-born designer has engineered the bag to create a seat-like insert for the dog. The designs also feature cushioning and insulation to ensure that the pampered pups remain warm and comfy at all times.

'The dogs love it because they get carried around pretty much like the same feeling you would get when laying in a hammock,' Kiki says.

'They love the gravity of being held by the fabric,' she adds.

According to the designer, each item begins with 'a personal vision' and is then sketched and handcrafted 'to bring the dream to life'.

The custom-made  pieces, which Kiki sells under the label Canine Couture for up to $1,600 (£1,000), have been a major hit with dog lovers across the pond - not to mention the dogs themselves.

The designer has also created stylish harnesses so that pet owners can schlep their furry friends around in style.

And not to leave the little pups feeling under dressed when they emerge from their perch, Kiki has designed some fabulous dresses for them too.

This past summer Kiki toured America in her very own 'Kiki' recreational vehicle. She visited all of the lower 48 states with her collections to visit the fans and customers most of whom have connected with through her 'Kiki Hamann Canine Couture' Facebook page.

And while orders continue to 'paw in' from around the globe, Kiki is focused on ensuring that dogs the world over continue to travel in style.
