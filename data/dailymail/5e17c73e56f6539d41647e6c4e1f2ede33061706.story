Police arrested a family of three in Tennessee Monday in a prostitution sting when a woman's mother and father came to a Madison hotel room bearing condoms.

As detailed by an arrest warrant, an undercover detective responded to an ad on Backpage.com that led him to meet with 33-year-old Christy Huxoll at the Madison Square Inn.

She agreed to perform sexual acts on the detective at a price of $160 per half hour.

Lisa Alff and Larry Huxoll told police they knew their daughter was a prostitute but provided her a hotel room to keep her from working on the street and made sure she had condoms

Once she took the money, the officer took her into custody and charged her with prostitution, WJBF reported.

She was also charged with unlawful use of drug paraphernalia.

After being placed under arrest she told authorities someone was bringing condoms to the motel.
