A couple have been left heartbroken after a leading IVF clinic destroyed their frozen embryos by mistake – and with it their hopes of giving their son a brother or sister.

Zeb and Nadia Urfan had planned  to have the embryos implanted to expand their family and give their five-year-old son a sibling.

But in a terrible administrative blunder, the embryos were removed from the deep-freeze at Jessop Fertility in Sheffield.

Staff at the NHS clinic, which is part of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, took them out because they had not received a consent form from the couple which they needed by law to keep the embryos in storage.

Originally they told the Urfans the form had not arrived at the hospital, but it has now emerged that the document, which the couple sent recorded delivery, did arrive – but may have been sent to the wrong department.

Last night the Jessop admitted there had been a mistake and offered its ‘heartfelt apologies’ to the couple.

But Mr Urfan, 39, a property landlord, said: ‘This should not have happened. We have been punished because of someone’s negligence. Our world has been turned upside down. They have taken away our dreams.

‘Our son is an adorable boy and I feel that we owe him a sibling, but now we cannot give him that.’

The couple, from Leicester, said they had decided to bring the matter to the public’s attention to make sure that it ‘never happens again’.

Mrs Urfan, 35, originally underwent IVF with donor eggs to conceive their son, who is now almost six.

She had the treatment after being told her chances of conceiving naturally were virtually zero.

The IVF cycle, which used Mr Urfan’s sperm and the same donor’s eggs, resulted in two spare viable embryos that were subsequently put in storage.

But last week they discovered that both the embryos had been destroyed.

Dotty Watkins, head of midwifery  at the Jessop, said the consent form may have been signed for in a different hospital department – meaning staff at the Jessop never got it.

She added: ‘We are carrying out a full review into what has happened and I would like to offer our heartfelt apologies to the couple concerned.  We can only imagine how distressed they must be.’

She insisted that the unit had stored embryos for ‘hundreds of couples over the past 13 years and this has never happened before’.

And she explained that it was routine practice to send out consent forms when the initial five-year storage period was up, adding: ‘Regrettably the Assisted Conception Unit did not receive the recorded delivery letter which was sent back by the couple stating that they wanted to extend the storage period. As a consequence of this the embryos were then thawed.

‘We have contacted the couple to apologise formally and we will be providing them with a full response in writing once the review is complete to explain fully what happened.

‘We will also be looking at any additional changes that need to be put  in place to limit the chances of this happening again. We are so very sorry this has happened.’
