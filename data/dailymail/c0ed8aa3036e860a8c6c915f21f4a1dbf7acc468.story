The sun and moon have been gracing our skies for 4.5 billion years.

It can be hard to imagine what another star would look in place of the sun, or how the night sky would appear with a planet instead of our satellite.

Now, the Russian Federal Space Agency has released an incredible animation of how it believes the planet’s horizons will appear – and the results are stunning.

Arcturus, a red giant, looks orange to the eye. It is the fourth brightest star in the sky, and is currently in the later stages of life. this is how it would appear on our horizon, filling up large parts of the sky 

The first animation reveals Earth in various lights by placing a different stars at the heart of our solar system.

The opening star, Alpha Centauri, is the nearest visible sun to our own, and one of the brightest in the southern night sky.

In reality, it is about 4.3 light-years away, nearly 300,000 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. 

If it replaced our sun, a double-star system would appear in our skies.

Along with its companion, Alpha Centauri B, it orbits a common centre of gravity every 80 years.

Sirius, the brightest star in Earth night sky is almost twice as big as the sun. It would be bathing us in a bright whitish-blue light

The average distance between them is about 11 astronomical units (AU) — about the same distance as the sun to Uranus.

Sirius meanwhile is the brightest star in the sky, and closes to Earth at 8.6 light years, with a mass double that of our sun.

Sirius in the constellation Canis Major the Greater Dog and on planet’s horizon would appear under a blue haze.

The animation also reveals Arcturus filling Earth’s skies. Arcturus, a red giant, looks orange to the eye. It is the fourth brightest star in the sky, and is currently in the later stages of life.

Vega, meanwhile, is about the same size as our sun but brighter and hotter.

The final star to be shown is Polaris, also known as the North Star. It is located on the handle tip of the Little Dipper.

The Russian Federal Space Agency has also created a video of what Earth’s skies would look like if the moon was replaced by Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Earth.

It shows just how large some of the planets are, with Jupiter and Saturn filling up most of the sky.

This is how a sunset on Earth would look like if the sun were replaced with Arcturus, one of the brightest stars in our 'neigbourhood'

The final star to be shown is Polaris. It is famous for holding nearly still in our sky while the entire northern sky moves around it because it’s located  at the north celestial pole

Moon: 1,080 miles (1,738km)

Mars: 2,111 miles (3,397km)

Venus: 3,761 miles (6,052km)

Neptune (equatorial): 15,701 miles (25,269km)

Uranus (equatorial): 15,882 miles (25,559km) 

Saturn (equatorial, not including rings): 37,449 miles (60,268km)

Jupiter (equatorial): 44,422 miles (71,490km) 

With our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius, the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth.

Mars, for instance, is about twice the size, with a radius of 1,080 miles (3,397km).

Uranus is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles (25,559km) in radius, while Jupiter completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km).

Interestingly, some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with Earth.

Dione, for example, which orbits Saturn at a distance of 235,000 miles (377,000km), would likely impact Earth if Saturn were in place of the moon.

Another interesting effect would be the gravitational influence on Earth if the planets were placed that close.

They could strip away our atmosphere and cause huge tides and volcanoes.

If Jupiter were the planet in the moon's position, it’s likely Earth would not even survive intact, being close enough to possibly be ripped apart and form a ring around the gas giant.
