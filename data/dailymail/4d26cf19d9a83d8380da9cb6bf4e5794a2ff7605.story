Louis van Gaal believes competition between goalkeepers David de Gea and Victor Valdes will help to transform Manchester United in to the best team in the world.

Speaking a day after United signed Valdes on an 18-month deal, Van Gaal challenged him to dislodge Old Trafford number one from the team.

The United manager said: 'Nobody is happy to be number two.

Louis van Gaal believes having the 'best players' like the two goalkeepers can help United be the best

'He has to have the ambition to beat De Gea.

'That will be very hard for him but my ambition is to have the best players who can co-operate and make us the best team in the world.'

Van Gaal would not be drawn on whether United will sign any other players in January but revealed that Ashley Young is the squad's only current injury.

Young's hamstring injury will keep him out for four weeks and Van Gaal said: 'We only have one injury.

'Can you believe it?!'
