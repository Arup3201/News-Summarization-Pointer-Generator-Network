The U.S Air 
Force’s highly secret unmanned space plane will land in June - ending a year-long mission in orbit.

The experimental Boeing X37-B has been circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour and was due to land in California in December. It is now expected  to land in mid to late June.

At launch, the space plane was accompanied by staff in biohazard suits, leading to speculation that there were radioactive components on board.

Mystery tour: The mission of the X-37B space plane was extended after it spent nine months orbiting the Earth

The men and women of Team Vandenberg are
 ready to execute safe landing operations anytime and at a moment's 
notice,' said Colonel Nina Armagno of the U.S. Air Force's Space Wing.

The plane resembles a mini space shuttle and is the second to fly in space.

It was meant to land in March, but the mission of the X-37B orbital test vehicle was extended – for unknown reasons.

The first one landed last December at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California after more than seven months in orbit.

The 29-foot, solar-powered craft had an original mission of 270 days. 

The
 Air Force said the second mission was to further test the technology 
but the ultimate purpose has largely remained a mystery.

The vehicle's systems program director, Lieutenant-colonel Tom McIntyre, told the Los Angeles Times in December: 'We initially planned for a nine-month mission. Keeping the X-37 in orbit will provide 
us with additional experimentation opportunities and allow us to extract
 the maximum value out of the mission.'

Questions: The unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the U.S. Air Force - but its purpose has never fully been explained

However, many sceptics think that the vehicle's mission is defence or spy-related.

There are rumours circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new Chinese space station, Tiangong.

However, analysts have pointed out 
that surveillance would be tricky, since the spacecraft would rush 
past each other at thousands of metres per second.

And Brian Weeden, from the Secure World
 Foundation, pointed out to the BBC: ‘If the U.S. really wanted to 
observe Tiangong, it has enough assets to do that without using X-37B.’

Last May, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which

 included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan,
 heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for 
surveillance.

Other industry analysts have 
speculated that the Air Force is just making use of the X-37B’s amazing 
fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show 
off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts.

After all, under budget cuts for 2013 to 2017 proposed by the Obama administration, the office that developed 
the X-37 will be shut down.

According
 to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth 
orbit, between 110 and 500 miles above earth. By comparison, the 
International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles.

The current flight launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in March.
