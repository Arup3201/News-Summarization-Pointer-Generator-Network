Cash-strapped France could sell the Mona Lisa to help pay off its vast national debt, the nation's media has suggested.

The radical plan to put the world's best known painting on the market could 'make a dent' in the country's crippling £1,600billion deficit, state-run news channel France 24 said.

The Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece hanging in the Louvre Museum in Paris is seen by up to a million visitors a year.

The painting is often called 'priceless' but was valued at £60million in 1962 for insurance purposes.

But with inflation and a further surge in art prices taken into account, the 2014 value of the artwork could now be around £1.5billion  - or almost one per cent of national debt.

The France 24 news website wrote: 'Her enigmatic smile beams down on hundreds of thousands of tourists a year at the Louvre Museum in Paris.

'And she could also bring a smile to France's cash-strapped government if a sale could ease the national debt.'

Paris also has another 173 museums brimming with hugely valuable works of art, and a sale of the impressionists at the Musee d'Orsay alone would raise an estimated £3.5billion, the website said.

But selling off national treasures could be against the law because they they are owned by the public, it added.

France 24 wrote: 'Article 451-5 of the French Heritage Code law governing national treasures stipulates that 'Collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and cannot be otherwise'.

'Even a change in the law would be problematic, as most of France's cultural heritage has historically come from individual donors, who enjoy significant tax breaks in return for their generosity.

'They would have to be heavily compensated if their donated works were sold off.'

But Paris City Hall's Head of Culture Bruno Julliard said he was against the controversial solution to help rescue France's floundering economy.

He said: 'In theory a sale of the Mona Lisa would raise a very large sum of money. But France isn't yet in such dire economic straits.'

Heavily-indebted Portugal is doing something similar by putting its state-owned collection of Miro paintings up for sale.

It hopes to recuperate £29million  - a tiny fraction of its £168billion national debt.

Meanwhile, France has been selling off what it can within the law, including the finest wines from the Elysee presidential palace cellar, and the former International Conference Centre near the Arc de Triomphe.

The latter went to Qatari and Chinese buyers who spent 380 million pounds renovating the building to be reopened as the Peninsula Paris hotel, while private wine collectors have been buying up the finest vintages from the presidential cellars.

There is, however, some light at the end of the tunnel for France's finances, because the country's descent down the World Economic Forum's league of economic strength has been arrested. 

After dropping for four consecutive years, France is clinging on to the No23 spot.

The report said: 'The [French] government has promised a 'competitiveness shock' and is considering a number of business-friendly measures, including a simplification of administrative procedures, in order to revive growth and reduce the country's stubbornly high level of unemployment.'

It added: 'Its infrastructure is still among the best in the world. France also obtains good marks for the quality and quantity of education at all levels, and it boasts a high degree of technological adoption.' 

Britain has climbed one spot to No9, the U.S is third, while Switzerland takes first place.
