Liverpool sold £50,000 worth of Mario Balotelli shirts on the day the Italian striker moved to Anfield this summer.

The 24-year-old striker joined Liverpool in a £16million switch from AC Milan in August.

And, speaking at a Soccerex conference in Manchester, chief executive Ian Ayre said: 'Liverpool had success and opportunities to develop in the past and didn’t take them. That won’t happen again.

'Having the right people and trust allows the club to maximise signings like Balotelli, leading to £50,000 worth of shirt sales.'

Balotelli made his debut in a 3-0 win over Tottenham at White Hart Lane.

The Italian striker, who scored 20 goals in 54 league games for Manchester City between 2010 and 2013, didn't score during that clash but impressed with his teamwork.

Balotelli's £16m arrival provides striker competition and added depth alongside Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert as Liverpool embark on their first Champions League campaign in five seasons. 

Ayre also said that Liverpool's popularity is growing and pointed to the number of views the club's official website has received.

The Liverpool chief executive also said that he expected every home game this season to be a sell-out.

'Last month we saw 10m unique users and 100 million page views on the official website,' Ayre said. 'You can only measure success by the number of people you engage and satisfy.'
