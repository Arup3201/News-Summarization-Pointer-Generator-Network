A Texas man now says his pregnant wife was responsible for sending ricin-laced letters sent to President Obama and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, after she accused him of sending the notes.

The Army veteran, believed to be Nathaniel Richardson, 33, has accused his wife of sending the letters, saying the woman set him up.

His wife, actress Shannon Guess, 36, told investigators she found a container of ricin in their fridge and has blamed her husband for sending the poisonous notes to public officials.

Questions: A man identified by neighbors as Nathaniel Richardson is being questioned in connection to ricin-laced letters sent to Mayor Bloomberg after his wife, right, found a suspicious liquid in their fridge

The man, who neighbors identified to KSLA as father-of-five Nathaniel Richardson, was questioned
 in connection with poison letters sent to President Obama and New York 
City Mayor Michael Bloomberg after his wife found a container in their 
refrigerator filled with what appeared to be ricin.

According to the New York Post, Richardson was released on Friday after authorities didn't have enough evidence to hold him but a source said that he is 'still a suspect.'

Guess is a civilian employee of the Department of Defense who works at the Red River Army Depot.

His
 wife told officers that as well as the 
container in the fridge, she also found internet searches related to 
ricin production, Obama and Bloomberg on their computer.

The husband is now saying that he was set up by the woman and he claimed that the plot was her idea during questioning. The Post reports that both will take polygraph tests.

Guess is a model and actress 
who has had small roles in The Vampire Diaries and The Walking Dead. She has been married three times and
 is pregnant with her sixth child.

The
 development comes two days after it emerged that Bloomberg and his 
anti-gun group were sent two ricin-laced letters. On Thursday, it was 
revealed that another, identical letter was sent to Obama.

Neighbors said Richardson worked at the Red River Army Depot, which was once used as an ammunition storage facility, and which now repairs Humvees and other military vehicles.

It comes after one of the ricin-tainted letters intended for Bloomberg was pictured for the first time.

The envelope shows the letter, posted
 on May 20, was postmarked at Shreveport, Louisiana, where other letters
 intended for Mayor Bloomberg and President Obama were also handled.

Sources said that Richardson has connections to Shreveport. The city's postal center handles mail from Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas, KSLA reported.

One of the ricin-tainted letters sent to Bloomberg has been pictured. It reads:

'You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns.

'Anyone
 wants to come to my house will be shot in the face.

'The right to bear 
arms is my constitutional God-given right and I will exercise that right
 'til the day I die.

'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you.'

The typed threat in the letter, 
splattered with the poisonous substance, is also shown. It tells the 
pro-gun control mayor: 'You will have to kill me and my family before 
you get my guns.

'Anyone
 wants to come to my house will be shot in the face. The right to bear 
arms is my constitutional God-given right and I will exercise that right
 'til the day I die.

'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you.'

The letter sent to President Obama contained the same chilling text, sources said on Thursday.

The letter to the president was received at a mail screening facility and did not reach the White House, law enforcement sources told NBC4.

One of the letters sent to Bloomberg was retrieved at the City Hall, and the second arrived at the headquarters of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg 
operates and personally finances.

They contained threats warning him to
 stay away from the gun laws debate, authorities said.

NYPD officials said
the threatening letters were opened on Friday in New York at the 
city's mail facility and on Sunday in Washington at the headquarters of 
the nonprofit.

Three 
members of the NYPD fell ill after being exposed to the letters, which 
contained a 'pink, orange oily substance', authorities said. Their 
symptoms have since subsided.

Bloomberg, speaking Friday on his weekly WOR Radio show, shrugged off any specter of danger.

'There's always threats, 
unfortunately. That comes with the job,' he said. 'I trust the police 
department and I feel perfectly safe. I've got more danger from 
lightning than from anything else and I'll go about my business.'

On Wednesday, he said it would not scare him away from 
engaging in the debate over gun laws.

'There's 12,000 people that are going
 to get killed this year with guns and 19,000 that are going to commit 
suicide with guns, and we're not going to walk away from those efforts,'
 he said.

'And I know I
 speak for all of the close to 1,000 mayors,' in Mayors Against Illegal 
Guns, he said.

'This is a scourge on the country that we just have to 
make sure that we get under control and eliminate.'

Targeted: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured at the Real Estate Board of New York on May 30th, was sent two letters laced with the poison ricin. The attack left three members of the NYPD ill

Under threat? A threatening letter sent to President Barack Obama is being tested for ricin after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was sent two similar letters laced with the poison

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. The beans can be safely made in to castor oil, but ricin is a part of the waste 'mash' from the oil production. It can be made into a powder, a mist or a pellet and is poisonous if inhaled, injected, or ingested.

Chewing the beans can also release the harmful substance.

For ricin to poison people, it would have to be a deliberate act, according to the CDC. The only accidental injuries could come through ingesting castor beans.

Ricin gets inside the cells of a personâ€™s body and prevents the cells from making proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die.

It can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and circulatory symptoms and can lead to death 36 to 72 hours after exposure.

In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella which had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin.

It is not yet known why it took the FBI and the NYPD five days to announce the discovery.

The matter is being investigated by 
the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force which said that the letter sent to 
Manhattan for billionaire Bloomberg arrived at 100 Gold Street - the 
home of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

Both
 the New York and Washington D.C. notes were addressed to Bloomberg and 
contained threats referencing the debate on gun laws.

The second letter to the mayor was 
opened by Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, who has 
not been reported to have fallen ill.

The NYPD confirmed preliminary testing indicated the presence of ricin.

'The FBI has an investigation ongoing and so things like the exact 
wording and the postmarks, etc. weâ€™re not going to disclose,' NYPD 
deputy commissioner Paul Browne told WCBS 880.

'It was a pink-orange 
oily substance that subsequently, in the preliminary tests, indicate the
 presence of ricin.'

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans.

It's not clear if the letters were related to other threatening, ricin-laced letters sent to other lawmakers recently.

Authorities are now 'in the process of searching to determine if there may be additional letters,' according to the statement.

Destination: The letter containing ricin addressed to New York City Mayor Bloomberg arrived here at 100 Gold Street - it was also where three members of the NYPD were exposed to the poison

Mayor
 Bloomberg is an outspoken critic of current gun laws and has campaigned
 nationally and on Capitol Hill for stricter gun legislation - using his
 own considerable wealth to fund commercials.

The
 confirmation of ricin present in both letters came through on Wednesday
 from the National Bioforensic Analysis Center in Maryland.

Ricin symptoms depend on the amount 
of exposure and dose received, but within a few hours lead to cough, 
fever, nausea, tightness in the chest and heavy breathing.

Death follows through fluid build up in the lungs.

Several
 ricin-laced letters have been sent to U.S. politicians over the past 
few months - including one addressed to President Obama in mid-April.

The Shreveport postal hub handles mail from parts of Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas.

A
 Mississippi man, James Everett Duschke stands accused of making the 
poison ricin and sending those letters - which also went to Senator 
Roger Wicker and a Mississippi judge.

Initially, a friend of Dutschke's, Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested, but he claimed he had been framed after he was released.
