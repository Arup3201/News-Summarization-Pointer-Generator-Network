Aviva Premiership champions Northampton have announced the signing of England prop Kieran Brookes.

Brookes, who has won six caps, will move to Franklin's Gardens from Newcastle in time for next season.

The 24-year-old also spent two seasons with Leicester during his career, while additional representative honours include appearances for England Saxons and England Under-20s.

'Kieran has steadily risen through the various England representative teams and has shown his quality at each level, building up experience along the way,' Northampton rugby director Jim Mallinder said.

'However, while we believe that he can contribute a great deal to our squad, we also think that Kieran has a lot more to come.

'We are looking forward to seeing him develop as a player at Franklin's Gardens.'

All six of Brookes' England outings were off the replacements' bench, starting against New Zealand in Dunedin last summer, and continuing through to the recent autumn campaign when he featured against South Africa, Samoa and Australia.

 Brookes has vowed to give his all to help Newcastle finish this season as high as possible before moving on

'I'm looking forward to joining Northampton Saints next season,' Brookes said.

'Their record over the last few seasons speaks for itself, and I am under no illusions of the quality of squad I'm going into.

'I've really enjoyed my time at Newcastle, and in particular working with John Wells and Micky Ward, both of whom have helped me massively, and in the meantime all my efforts will be concentrated on helping us finish as high up the league as we can.'

Newcastle rugby director Dean Richards, meanwhile, has expressed his disappointment over Brookes' Kingston Park exit.

'We are obviously disappointed to see Kieran head to Northampton,' Richards told the Falcons' official website.

'We would have liked him to stay here, at the club that has helped him to develop into the full England international that he is today.

'Attempts were made to retain Kieran over a 10-month period, but during the course of the negotiations it became clear that he and his agent were looking to move.'
