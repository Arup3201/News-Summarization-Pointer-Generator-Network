A 16-year-old Texas cheerleader with Down syndrome made her triumphant return to the field Thursday after being sidelined by school officials and labelled a liability last month.

Brittany Davila's story has sparked outrage when she was told during a volleyball game at Deek Park High School late last month that she could only cheer from the stands.

The snub against the honorary special needs cheerleader has made national headlines, prompting the local school district to meet with Brittany's family in order to clear up what they called a 'misunderstanding.'

‘We admit there were some miscommunications but the fact that when we were finally able to meet with the family, everything was resolved in about five minutes,’ Deer Park district spokesperson Matt Lucas told the local station KTRK.

On Thursday, Davila, dressed in her maroon and gold uniform, happily shook her pink pom poms along with the rest of the Deer Park cheer squad, giving her teammates high fives and blowing kisses at her family watching from the stands.

Freshman cheer captain Sara Washington said she is proud of Brittany, whom she praised for her performance on the team in her capacity as honorary cheerleader.

The school has designated an area for Brittany where she could take a break is she gets tired and wait while the other cheerleaders perform stunts.

Inspiring: The teen's grandmother hopes that Brittany's story would inspire other kids with disabilities to chase their dreams and not give up

Brittany's mother, Buffay Davila, came out Thursday to support her daughter and take pictures from the stands.

‘She was a little nervous when we were walking up here, but now that she's down there, she's in her groove, I guess,’ she told the station KTRK. 

The teen's grandmother Jyeneece Robbins has expressed hope that Brittany's story of perseverance will inspire other kids living with disabilities to follow their dreams.

‘She’s doing it,’ she told KHOU11. ‘She’s proving she can do it if you just give her a chance.’

Besides her new-found success in the cheer program, Brittany will be crowned today as a class representative for Homecoming.

Davila, a high school freshman, recently made the team as an honorary cheerleader. When she and her parents arrived for a volleyball game September 24, school officials told them Brittany could no longer be part of the team because she was a liability.

‘Being a parent of a child with special needs, the last thing you want to hear is your kid is a liability for any reason,’ Mom Buffy Davila told Click2Houston.

Despite showing up at the game in full uniform, Brittany was told to sit in the stands.

‘She didn’t understand what changed from last week to this week,’ her father Ruben told KHOU. ‘She was cheering along with them in the stands. She was excited, waving at them and blowing kisses.’

A day after the game, Brittany’s parents met with school officials to hear why they had decided that their daughter was a liability.

School officials expressed their concerns about Brittany's safety and that she might get run over by a player or accidentally hit by the ball.

The Davilas said their daughter was no more of a liability than any other member of the cheer leading squad.

‘She's no more of a safety risk, or however you want to word it, than any of the other cheerleaders that are standing on the sideline,’ said Mrs. Davila.

In the end a resolution was reached which addressed the school's concerns, but also allows Brittany to continue with the activity that she loves.

Brittany has been cheering since junior high and hopes to continue all the way through high school.

‘These kids are people, just like everybody else,’ said Mrs. Davila. ‘They don't want to be treated different. They want to be treated just like the rest of the kids that are around them.’

After Brittany's parents met with officials at Deer Park High School they relented and now the young girl will be able to perform with the cheerleaders
