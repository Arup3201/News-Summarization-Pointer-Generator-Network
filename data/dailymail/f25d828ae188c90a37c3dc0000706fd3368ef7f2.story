Russian writer Leo Tolstoy famously once said 'music is the shorthand of emotion', and with this in mind a New York artist has created a musical composition using just her brain waves.

Called Euonia, which is Greek for ‘beautiful thought’, Lisa Park was able to translate how her brain reacted to feelings of sadness, anger and desire directly into musical notes.

By training her brain to control these emotions, Park was then able to perform her musical score simply by thinking about it.

New York artist Lisa Park, pictured, used an EEG headset to transmit brainwave data via Bluetooth to her computer. Software then translated the brain waves into sounds and each of the different sounds were assigned to one of five speakers

The EEG headset Park used to record her brain activity is called MindWave.

Park transmitted the brainwave data from the MindWave via Bluetooth to her computer.

Software then translated the waves 
into sounds and each of the different sounds were assigned to one of 
five speakers placed beneath trays of water.

Each
 of the speakers were assigned a different emotion, including anger, 
hate, desire, sadness and happiness.

Park trained for a month by 
thinking of people and situations that made her feel these different 
emotions.

Park additionally moved her eyes towards the trays of water associated with the emotion she was feeling.

The EEG headset Park used to record her brain activity is called MindWave and is created by California-based neurology experts NeuroSky.

It is traditionally used to measures brainwave signals in students to monitor their attention levels during maths, memory and pattern recognition tests.

Park transmitted the brainwave data from the MindWave via Bluetooth to her computer.

Software then translated the waves into sounds and each of the different sounds were assigned to a set of five speakers placed beneath trays of water.

This meant Park, and her audience, could see exactly which speaker was playing the sound based on the jumping water droplets.

Each of the speakers were assigned a different emotion, including anger, hate, desire, sadness and happiness. Park additionally moved her eyes towards the trays of water associated with the emotion she was feeling.

The artist trained for a month by thinking of people and situations that made her feel these different emotions.

The movement of the water gave a visual representation of the speed, volume and pitch of the sound, and as brain activity and emotional intensity changed, so did the movement of the droplets.

The aim of her work is ‘to use technology to engage and evoke human emotion rather than alienation and create art that empowers the public through awareness of them.’

For the Euonia project, Park told Slate magazine the goal of the piece was 'to exercise control over her own mind, to make her mind so still and so calm that there’s nothing for the EEG sensor to read.'

Park was hoping that by calming her thoughts she could silence the speakers, and stop the water from moving.

She admitted that this was achievable when she was on her own, but performing made her nervous, which affected her inner calm.

She has previously used heart rate sensors to track how different emotions affect her body.

The movement of the water above each speaker gave a visual representation of the speed, volume and pitch of the sound. As brain activity and emotional intensity changed, so did the movement of the droplets. This meant Park, and her audience, could see exactly which speaker was playing the sound
