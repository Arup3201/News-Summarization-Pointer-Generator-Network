Smooth jazz star Kenny G has angered Chinese authorities by visiting a pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong and posing with the protesters.

The American musician caused a stir when he tweeted about his visit to the semi-autonomous city, where thousands of student-led demonstrators have occupied the streets for the past three weeks.

Having posed with the protesters' tents and taking selfies with their placards, the Chinese Foreign Ministry - which has claimed the protests are fueled by outside agents – publicly declared that Kenny G had been participating in an 'illegal activity.'

Kenny G has now deleted the selfie and issued an apology on Twitter, insisting he is not a foreign provocateur, does not support the protests and knows nothing of the situation in Hong Kong.

Not a supporter: This selfie - uploaded to Twitter by Kenny G - was captioned: 'In Hong Kong at the sight of the demonstration. I wish everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation'. The tweet is now deleted

Kenny G made his apology after after Beijing signaled its displeasure over his inharmonious visit and repeated concerns about meddling by external forces.

In the caption of one image he uploaded to Twitter, the musician wrote: 'In Hong Kong at the sight of the demonstration. I wish everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation.'

He took to social media again later to declare that he was not trying to defy the Chinese government, but rather had just happened to come across the protest zone while walking around as a tourist.

'I am not supporting the demonstrators as I don't really know anything about the situation,' he wrote on his Twitter and Facebook accounts.

 'I only wanted to share my wish for Peace for Hong Kong and for all of China.' 

Just a tourist: The American musician caused a stir when he tweeted about his visit to the semi-autonomous city, where thousands of student-led demonstrators have occupied the streets for the past three weeks

Photos had circulated earlier on social media of the star by himself and with protesters at the main protest zone near downtown Hong Kong.

The musician's  soprano saxophone are wildly popular in China, especially his song 'Going Home.'

The laidback track is regularly heard at closing time at train stations, department stores, airports, hotel lobbies and over loudspeakers in public parks.

He completed a four-concert tour of the country in September.

Demonstrations: Beijing has warned repeatedly that unspecified foreign forces are influencing the protesters in Hong Kong, without spelling out who exactly is involved

When asked about the appearance, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying paused and noted Kenny G's popularity - and then warned foreigners not to get involved.

'I think Kenny G's music is popular in China, though regarding the illegal protest in Hong Kong, the Chinese government has a clear position. We think that is an illegal campaign,' Hua said.

'We support the government of Hong Kong to handle it in accordance with the law to maintain stability in Hong Kong. Thus we hope all foreign countries and individuals could be discreet in words and deeds and not support the illegal protest in any forms,' she said.

Beijing has warned repeatedly that unspecified foreign forces are influencing the protesters in Hong Kong, without spelling out who exactly is involved. 

Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Leung Chun-ying, has also recently taken up the claims.
