An escaped murder suspect was recaptured on Wednesday after breaking out of a psychiatric hospital, police said.

Rocco Jesse Zuccaro was found near a natural gas facility in Harrison County, West Virginia State Police told WHSV.

The 30-year-old escaped from William R Sharpe Jr Hospital in Weston on Monday afternoon by climbing over a wall while he was undergoing a mental evaluation. 

Zuccaro has been charged with the murder of Jason Lee Pratz, 30, in 2013 after he allegedly shot him dead at his home.

Pratz, a former medical worker, was killed at his home in McKinleyville, West Virginia, on February 2013. Someone had also tried to set fire to his home before the shooting.

The suspect was found incompetent to stand trial in late February. 

Zuccaro, who is 6ft, 170lb, is originally from Burgettstown, Pennsylvania.  

The suspect's lawyer said that his client is mentally ill and he has previously refused to take medication prescribed to him, according to the Weirton Daily Times. 

Earlier this year, Zuccaro was sentenced to 90 days at William Sharpe to 'regain competence'.

West Virginia State Police had advised people who may come in contact with Zuccaro not to approach him and contact them with any information about his possible location.

Lieutenant Baylous said that the murder suspect was 'a danger to the public'.
