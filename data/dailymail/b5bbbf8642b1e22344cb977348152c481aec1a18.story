A Swiss firm has unveiled radical plans to launch a space shuttle from the top of an Airbus passenger jet.

Swiss Space Systems says the system will be a far cheaper way to launch satellites - and says it can sell launches for £7m, around a quarter of the price currently charged.

The firm claims its system, which could launch satellites weighing upto 250kg, could take to the air in 2017.

Swiss Space Systems aims to 'democratize' access to space by launching small satellites for around £7m

How it will work: The S3 system uses an Airbus A300 to take the shuttle up to 10,000m on its back.
Once it reaches this height the shuttle is released and its jet engines kick in to take it to an altitude of 80km, when the satellites are put into orbit and the shuttle glides back to earth

The Swiss Space Systems launch model uses
an Airbus A300, an aircraft already certified for zero gravity flights,
to take the shuttle up to 10,000m on its back.

Once it reaches this height, the shuttle will be launched to take it to an altitude of 80km, when the spaceplane doors open and put the satellites 
into orbit.

Once this operation has been completed, the shuttle will 
return to earth by gliding towards its launch airport - and can be reused.

'Our launch programme benefits from 
the input of technologies previously developed and certified through 
original partnerships between major players in the aerospace sector such
as the European Space Agency (ESA), Dassault Aviation, the Von Karman 
Institute and Sonaca,' said the founder and CEO of S3, Pascal Jaussi.

The firm also plans to build its own spaceport in Payerne, although says in theory it could launch from any airport.

Other countries, such as Malaysia and Morocco, announced during the launch that they would be partnering with S3 in order to build spaceports in their countries too and discussions are under way with several other potential partners.

The system is likely to face competition from Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which has announced plans for a version of its Galactic space system, called LauncherOne, that could also deliver satellites into orbit at low cost.

It has produced a design that will be air-launched from Virgin Galactic’s carrier aircraft WhiteKnightTwo, the same mothership that will launch the company's SpaceShipTwo on suborbital passenger flights.
