A New York City real-estate mogul has filed a lawsuit against the architect who designed his Southampton mansion five feet too low.

In papers filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court, Laurence Gluck claims James R. McDonough shortchanged the structure of crucial attic space.

Gluck, who leads Stellar Management in New York City, purchased two side-by-side Southampton properties for $6 million in 2012.

Size matters: Laurence Gluck says his Southampton mansion was designed five feet too low

He then hired McDonough to design him a seven-bedroom, 12-bathroom home complete with fireplaces, garage, tennis court, pool and cabana for a further $6.5 million.

However, once construction was completed on the home, Gluck discovered that the height of the house fell short by five feet.

According to the New York Post, Gluck's lawsuit claims that McDonough erred by counting the house's chimneys against Southampton's 32-foot height limit, meaning the roof is only 27 feet.

The suit claims the shorter roof height leaves 'virtually no attic space or room to run duct work throughout the second floor.'

McDonough denies Gluck's charges unequivocally.

'Absolutely not,' he told the New York Post.

'The height of the house was never once discussed.'

Gluck says the alleged error has 'substantially delayed' the completion of his new home and is seeking $500,000 in compensation.

Gluck, a 30-year real-estate veteran. founded Stellar Management after a career in real-estate law.
