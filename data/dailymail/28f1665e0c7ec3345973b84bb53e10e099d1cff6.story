A 63-year-old man has been given his wife's blessing to sleep with a cougar – the 15-stone mountain lion he cuddles up to every night and refers to as his '200lb daughter'.

Mario 'Catman' Infanti adopted his unusual pet Sasha when she was just a kitten and says she now sees him as her 'mother'.

His wife Lenore, 53, completely supports his close relationship with the huge animal, which lives in and around their home in Cape Coral, Florida.

Mario Infanti often cuddles up to his pet cougar Sasha after raising her from a kitten

He has built a custom-made habitat for the creature, with whom he often shares his swimming pool

His wife Lenore says she gets lots of jokes about his relationship with the cougar, but supports his passion for big cats

Mr Infanti said: 'Sasha is more like family to me than a lot of my family. She's the love of my life, she's like my 200lb daughter. I would do anything for her.'

The professional jazz guitarist had wanted to own a big cat since watching Tarzan as a child and moved to Florida specifically to enjoy its relaxed laws on owning dangerous creatures.

He bottle-raised Sasha as a newborn and he or his wife have been by her side 24 hours a day ever since.

At first she slept in the couple's bed with them but was soon too big to fit and had began to maul and chew it.

The couple then built a 3,000-square-foot habitat for her to live in, with access to a swimming pool, toys and trees.

Sasha is also allowed into the house and enjoys nothing more than curling up on her adopted parent Mr Infanti as he watches TV.

The 'Catman', who also owns a Siberian lynx, knows never to turn his back on Sasha - who he estimates is four times stronger than him.

He said: 'I don't think she'll rip anybody's face off. She's not that kind of an aggressive cat.

'The only time she gets a little dangerous is when she gets over-playful or over-affectionate. I have a little scar on my lower leg but it's nothing. You could hardly notice it.'

Mr Infanti carries a bottle of spirit vinegar for self-defence in case Sasha ever turns on him, as cougars cannot stand the smell of the liquid.

He added: 'I have never had a problem with Sasha. The only time I had trouble (with animals) was when I was training to get my license.

'I got into a little tussle with a 350lb tiger that I basically brought up. She wanted to play rough and I didn't.The main thing is to show no fear.'

Cougars in captivity live 25-30 years compared with seven to 10 years in the wild. So with Sasha only just turning 14, the unusual family are looking forward to spending more time together.

Despite their happiness, Mr and Mrs Infanti have had to make plenty of sacrifices to have her - including not having children of their own.

They have also spent more than $118,000 on her upkeep - including $33,700 on the custom-made habitat.

Although she is younger than her husband, Mrs Infanti says she has often received jokes about being Mr Infanti's second cougar, a term used to describe women who go after younger men.

She said: 'It is quite expensive to feed her but we look at her as one of children.

He thinks Sasha is better off in the safety and comfort of her enclosure at his home, rather than at risk in the wild

'So what we feed them would be money we would have otherwise put aside for a college education.'

Mrs Infanti has also been trained to handle Sasha and is often left to feed her meat at dusk - her preferred feeding time - while Mr Infanti is playing gigs.

She added: 'When he goes she'll constantly look at the window and meow for him. I'll go out there to feed her and she'll look past me and look like, "okay where's daddy?"

'When he is on tour he'll call every night and I'll put the phone up to the fence and he'll talk to the cat. Mario loves Sasha with all his heart, he really does.'

Lions which live in captivity have a much longer life expectancy than those living in the wild, experts say

Mrs Infanti says the most difficult time for Sasha is when her husband, who is a professional jazz guitarist, is on tour

Mr Infanti sometimes gets criticism for keeping a pet cougar but says Sasha would be a lot worse off fending for herself.

He said: 'There are a couple of diehards who say she should be in the wild - but how much wild is there left? I mean we're taking all their wild away from them.

'She's better off living with us, being fed everyday, being cared for medically, being loved and being treated like she should be treated rather than being chased off her territory or hunted or rundown by a car.

'I think she has a great life and she's made my life a whole lot better too.

'But it's a lifetime commitment, if you're not willing to put your whole life to this thing then you shouldn't own one of these pets.'
