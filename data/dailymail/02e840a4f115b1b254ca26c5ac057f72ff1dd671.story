New emails released in the Sony hack seem to illustrate the very big role the husband of studio head Amy Pascal played in her decision making on the job. 

There was much speculation as to why Sony fired their head of communications, Charles Sipkins, this November,  just 15 months after he started on the job, and now an email exchange between Pascal and Bernie Weinraub, her husband, sheds some possible light on the situation.

It seems that after Pascal was not invited to attend an executive roundtable hosted by The Hollywood Reporter, Weinraub told her to get rid of Sipkins.

Man with a plan: Bernie Weinraub suggested his wife Amy Pascal (above) 'fire' the studio's head of communications after she was not invited to an industry event

He's out: Six days after the email, Charles Sipkins (above) was out of a job at Sony

In the email exchange, obtained by Bloomberg News, Weinraub writes to his wife after learning of this slight, 'I would fire your P.R. guy immediately.'

He then adds, 'Or at least tell him you’re not going to deal with him anymore.'

Pascal was the only head of a major studio not on hand for the event. 

Shockingly, Pascal then forwarded the email to George Rose, the head of human resources at Sony, who responds by saying; 'He's right.'

Six days later, Sipkins was out of a job.

Making matters worse, the executive roundtable, which is held every year, is usually meant to be a discussion of the films from each studio that could possibly be contenders during awards season, and Sony has numerous films expected to garner nominations in major categories at this year's Academy Awards.

The studio just received eight  Golden Globes nominations between Sony and Sony Pictures Classics, and will likely have one major Oscar contender across the board in the Steve Carrel drama Foxcatcher.

Fox's Jim Gianopulos, Paramount's Brad Grey, Disney Studios' Alan Horn, Universal's Donna Langley, IFC Films' Jonathan Sehring and Warner Brothers' Kevin Tsujihara were invited to the event.

Pascal commented on this recent leak by saying the roundtable incident had nothing to do with the decision to terminate Sipkins. 

Others who have been slighted by Pascal in leaked emails this week include President Obama, who was the subject of a racist exchange between her and producer Scott Rudin, and writer Aaron Sorkin, who she called 'broke' before alleging he only wanted to adapt a book because he was sleeping with the writer.

White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said on Friday that he felt an apology from Pascal and Sony was 'appropriate.' 

Sipkins and Weinraub have yet to comment on these most recent emails.
