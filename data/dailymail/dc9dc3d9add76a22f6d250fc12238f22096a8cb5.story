Owning a bike gives you a sense of freedom like no other, yet owning a bike shop can be a strangely frustrating experience.

One Canadian war veteran who now operates a tiny cycle chop in Cochrane, Alberta has been told to change the store's name.

Dan Richter, owner of Cafe Roubaix Bicycle Studio and says he's received a letter from the lawyers of the giants of the U.S. bike industry, Specialized.

Name calling: Dan Richter, the owner of a small bike shop in Alberta, Canada has been told to change its name by a bicycle company that owns the trademark of the word 'Roubaix'

Legal action: A small bike shop in Cochrane, Alberta, Canada has recently been threatened with legal action by US bicycle manufacturer Specialized regarding a trademark violation concerning the shop's name

The company want to see the store’s name change because Specialized own the trademark on the word Roubaix, which they use to market a brand of road bike.

Mr Richter says he didn’t name his store after the company’s bike, but rather after a region in France that hosts one of the most famous bike races in the world, the grueling 117-year-old Paris-Roubaix.

Essentially, the name is an icon of bike culture and there a hundreds of other products from bike tires to a cycling tights that use French region's name.

'It’s been frustrating,' Mr Richter told the Calgary Herald. 'The response throughout this process (from Specialized) has been arrogant and almost unbelievably dismissive.'

The rights: Specialized claims this is a matter of defending a legally owned trademark

What next? Richter has sought legal assistance in determining whether Roubaix can be registered in Canada. However, he estimates it will take upwards of $150,000 to contest the case in court, a price which may be prohibitive to the small business owner

'We didn’t want to go public, but they’ve made it clear on no uncertain terms, they are going to sue.'

Larry Koury, managing director of Specialized Canada Inc says the company has a right to defend its legally owned trademark.

'A simple trademark search would have prevented this,' Koury wrote in an email, along with a reference to the federal government’s trademark database showing Specialized’s registration of the word Roubaix. 'We are required to defend or lose our trademark registration.'

Mr Richter who served in Afghanistan says running the store has helped him over come post-traumatic stress disorder.

After making a search online he did not feel that naming his shop after a geographical location would contradict Canada’s intellectual property protection laws.

'I had assumed I could not register Roubaix as a trademark as it is a geographical location well known in cycling, not to mention the wide-spread use of the term Roubaix throughout the industry,' said Mr Richter.

The real story: Richter, a military veteran medically released from service in 2012 after developing PTSD during deployment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, opened his shop on March 1, 2013 and asserts the shop's name is an homage to Roubaix, France

Innocent: 'I had assumed I could not register Roubaix as a trademark as it is a geographical location well known in cycling, not to mention the wide-spread use of the term Roubaix throughout the industry,' said Richter

'I thought I could freely use Roubaix. To be informed I cannot use the name is devastating. I invested my life savings, military severance pay, as well as all my Veteran's Affairs award for my illness into Café Roubaix.'

Furthermore, his store sells high-end bikes and does not sell Specialized products. He doesn’t believe the name would confuse anybody shopping for bikes.

'I understand the need for the protection of intellectual property, but this is named after a city known worldwide for this race,' Mr Richter said.

'For our customer base, there’s an appeal (with the name Roubaix). Our market understands that race, and it reflects what we want to provide for them.'

Richter says his lawyer thinks they have a good case to make, but the fight could cost upwards of $150,000 in legal fees.

He claims that changing his company’s name isn’t as simple as putting up a new sign and logo.

In the year since the store opened he has built up a decent brand, reputation and online presence.

There appears to be some positive news as a result of the potential brawl; Café Roubaix is also selling far more products from its online store than usual.

A number of cyclists have changed their Twitter to include the word Roubaix and say they will be boycotting Specialized until it backs down.

Ideas: 'I thought I could freely use Roubaix. To be informed I cannot use the name is devastating. I invested my life savings, military severance pay, as well as all my Veteran's Affairs award for my illness into Café Roubaix.'
