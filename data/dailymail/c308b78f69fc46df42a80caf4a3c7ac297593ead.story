People who have been abused, abandoned and neglected often struggle to identify kind facial expressions so that a smile can seem like a threat.

But now a new type of therapy has been developed to help those suffering from anxiety or depression who find it difficult to connect with others.

The ‘compassion game’ trains people to recognise kindness and compassion in a bid to desensitise patients and rid them of threatening feelings in response to seeing kind faces.

A scientist from Cardiff University developed the 'compassion game' to train people suffering from depression or anxiety to recognise kindness in a bid to rid them of threatening feelings in response to seeing kind faces. To play, the person has to pick out the compassionate face from the more critical faces

People with attachment disorders can harbour highly self-critical attitudes and can feel threatened by compassionate facial expressions, often responding with fear or grief.

This can have crippling consequences for patients’ recovery, leaving them struggling to form meaningful relationships with other people and relate to their environment.

Dr Kirsten McEwan from Cardiff University’s School of Medicine developed a set of facial expressions to assess the degree to which individuals who are highly self-critical, anxious or depressed may struggle to process and receive compassion.

While studying for her PhD at the University of Derby, she found that found that individuals who were highly self-criticical did indeed struggle to process and pay attention to compassionate emotions and she believes this could be a factor in mood disorders and a block to therapy.

She developed a ‘compassion game’ that trains individuals to recognise kindness and compassion.

Participants search for a compassionate face among a number of critical faces, which retrains the automatic, unconscious biases towards threatening stimuli commonly shown by people with mood disorders, according to the study published in Plos One journal.

People who were abused as children are twice as likely to suffer from depression, according to a 2011 study.

They are also less likely to respond to depression treatments.

Scientists examined data from 26 separate studies involving more than 23,000 participants.

The research was carried out by a team from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London.

Lead
 investigator Dr Andrea Danese, said: 'Childhood maltreatment is 
associated both with an increased risk of developing recurrent and 
persistent episodes of depression, and with an increased risk of 
responding poorly to treatment.

'Therefore,
 prevention and early therapeutic interventions targeting childhood 
maltreatment could prove vital in helping prevent the major health 
burden owing to depression.

'Knowing
 that individuals with a history of maltreatment won't respond as well 
to treatment may also be valuable for clinicians in determining 
patients' prognosis.'

One in 10 children worldwide are exposed to maltreatment including psychological, physical or sexual abuse or neglect.

People with attachment disorders can harbour highly self-critical attitudes and can feel threatened by compassionate facial expressions, often responding with fear or grief. Here, a set of images used within the game show a man with a neutral, compassionate and critical expression

‘We found that the more self-critical participants were, the less able they were to find kind and compassionate faces when amongst an array of more critical expressions,’ Dr McEwan said.

‘Conversely, participants of a less self-critical disposition demonstrated an enhanced awareness of kind faces,’ she added.

Participants in the study played the ‘compassion game’ alongside a control game for two weeks.

Dr McEwan said: ‘We found significant improvements across a variety of self-reported wellbeing outcome measures including self-criticism, depression, anxiety and stress. The aim of the game is to desensitise patients to compassionate images and rid them of threatening feelings.’

While the game is not currently readily available online, there are plans to make it available in the not too distant future.

The inspiration for the research came from anecdotal evidence taken from clinicians at Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, who observed that difficulties in processing the emotions of others were a big hindrance to patient recovery.

Dr McEwan said that Matt Damon's character in the film Good Will Hunting (pictured) shows the problem of a person who is struggling to come to terms with an abuse-filled past and who rejects therapy and friendship from those outside his own friendship circle

Dr McEwan said that Matt Damon’s character in the film Good Will Hunting shows the problem of a person who is struggling to come to terms with an abuse-filled past - and rejects therapy and friendship from those outside his own friendship circle.

There is increasing evidence to show that the ability to process compassion from others triggers the release of natural chemicals such as endorphins and opiates which aides a significant reduction in anxiety, depression and self-criticism and regulates how threatened patients feel during therapy.

‘The NHS is currently grappling with the challenge of making unprecedented efficiency savings whilst improving the nation’s mental health, Dr McEwan said.

‘This computer-based intervention offers the potential to deliver a cheap and easily accessible treatment for depression and anxiety in a non-stigmatising environment.’
