The winner of a £148million lottery jackpot has closed his music shop – after it was targeted by spongers looking for handouts.

Despite his stunning win in the Euromillions draw, father-of-two Adrian Bayford chose to continue dealing with the public because he enjoyed it so much.

But he has now decided to close the independent Suffolk Music Centre in Haverhill because of abuse from visitors.

In demand: Lottery winner Adrian Bayford (pictured with his wife Gillian), has shut his business after he was bombarded with requests for cash following his huge £148miillion win

Mr Bayford, 41, went back to work behind the counter just two weeks after he and his wife Gillian, 40, won the massive prize in August last year. Neighbours say he held a closing-down sale before Christmas, charging just £10 for as many as 20 second-hand CDs or DVDs.

The shop shut at the end of December and has been stripped of all its shelving and contents. The owner of a nearby business said yesterday: ‘Adrian was getting a lot of grief from people walking in and trying to get cash off him.

‘There are idiots in every town and some of them got nasty when he turned them away. He just does not need that kind of abuse.’

The shop which Mr Bayford ran with business partner Richard Hudspith also used to sell guitars. A sign on the window states that the multi-millionaire hopes to start a new business, selling and repairing musical instruments.

Mr Bayford, a former postman, used to sell second-hand CDs from a market stall.

After he and his wife realised they had hit the jackpot they celebrated by ordering a Domino’s Pizza and booked an easyJet flight to Scotland.  The Bayfords’ win placed them at 516th in the Sunday Times Rich List and the couple recently spent £6million on a mansion and country estate in East Anglia.

The Grade II-listed Georgian mansion is set in more than 100 acres of woods and farmland, and has seven bedrooms and four marble bathrooms as well as a three-bedroom annexe, a lodge, a three-bedroom farmhouse and four cottages.

A friend of the couple said: ‘Adrian and Gillian made no secret about wanting to buy a nice house when they went public with their win.

‘Some people expected them to move out of their old home straight away – but they have taken their time to find the ideal place.’

The Bayfords’ jackpot was the second-biggest to be won by Britons. The record is held by Colin and Christine Weir, from Ayrshire, who scooped £161million in July 2011.

Still on a budget: Adrian and Gillian Bayford board a helicopter after it was revealed that they had won £148million on the lottery. Within hours, they were on an easyJet flight to the continent with their two children

The couple scooped the second largest
lottery jackpot in British history in August with a ticket Mr Bayford 
bought at his local newsagents.

The first evidence of the start of their spending spree was spotted in the shape of a modest Ford family car.

The Bayfords stunned Britain with the
warm, laid back approach to super wealth and appeared to continue the 
modest trend by opting for a £17,000 4x4 Kuga.

The sensible buy was a far cry from the dream car Gillian admitted to craving when she discovered the win - a £60,000 Audi Q7.

Millions of admirers were surprised to hear the Bayfords celebrated their fortune by having takeaway pizzas from Dominos.

They shunned exclusive resorts and the tropics by jetting off for a caravaning holiday with Gillian's parents in Scotland.
