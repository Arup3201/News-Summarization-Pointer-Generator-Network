Cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez has returned to Argentina and looks to have played his last game for Newcastle United.

Sportsmail understands the 31-year-old is in talks with Velez Sarsfield and, with his Magpie contract set to expire in the summer, it is unlikely he will be afforded a final appearance for the club he has served since 2008.

Gutierrez has been building fitness with Newcastle's Under-21s since returning to Tyneside in December having been given the all-clear from testicular cancer.

The former Argentina international was first diagnosed in September, 2013. 

He had a testicle removed and returned to Premier League action. However, the cancer returned last summer and Gutierrez underwent a course of chemotherapy and beat the illness for a second time.

Newcastle fans had hoped to see the popular winger make a farewell outing at St James' Park, and Gutierrez told Sportsmail last month: 'Yes, I have played in a World Cup, but if I play again for Newcastle then that will be the best moment of my career.

'To get back after the cancer and chemotherapy, to put all of that behind me, would be a huge moment for me. It would be emotional.

'If I come back and play for Newcastle then for me it will be the best.' 

Gutierrez made his professional debut with Velez as an 18-year-old in 2001 and trained with the club last autumn as he began his comeback bid. 

Should talks prove successful then his Newcastle career will be over after 194 appearances and 11 goals, denying him the chance of an emotional cameo for the club.
