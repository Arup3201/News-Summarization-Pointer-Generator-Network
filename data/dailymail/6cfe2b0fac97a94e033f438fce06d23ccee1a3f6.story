Republican duo Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are one of the hottest tickets this nation has ever seen, and now there's proof that its not just their politics.

According to professors at the University of California, Mitt Romney scores in the 99th percentile of all politicians for his looks alone, far outpacing his running mate Paul Ryan, whose rock hard abs only earned him a spot in the 67th percentile.

The study was conducted to measure the 'competence' of politicians and how much, if any, their attractiveness affected the outcomes of their elections.

Hot Or Not: Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are one of the hottest presidential tickets this nation has ever seen and now there's proof that its not just their politics

Dangerous Duo: According to professors at the University of California, Mitt Romney scored in the 99 percentile of all politicians, far outpacing his running mate Paul Ryan, who's rock hard abs earned him only a spot in the 67th percentile of attractiveness

'Mitt Romney is better looking than almost everyone reading this,' Professor Ryan Enos wrote when describing his work.

In 2007, political science professors Matthew Atkinson, Seth Hill and Ryan Enos presented the faces of prominent politicians to University of California students for a split second and had them rank 'how competent' the person appeared.

'The students seeing the candidates did not know that they were politicians,' Mr Enos told the Mail Online.

'We believe that “competence” relates to general attractiveness, thus the fact that Romney and Palin both do quite well.'

Mrs Palin scored in the 95th percentile.

'Their answers appear to judge mostly just blunt attractiveness, but it is hard to know exactly what makes somebody think a face is “competent”', he said.  

'If the election were decided on looks, it would be no contest.'

Professor Ryan Enos

The trio presented all 728 of the governor and Senate candidates from 1994 to 2006 to the students, removing the highly recognizable ones so as not to cloud judgement.

Mitt Romney's 99th percentile put him below just a few other politicians.

'Only four people scored higher than him: John Thune, the South Dakota Republican Senator; Russ Feingold, the former Wisconsin Democrat Senator; Craig Benson, the former New Hampshire Republican Governor; and John Sanchez, who had run for Governor of New Mexico as a Republican and is now the Lt. Governor of New Mexico,' Professor Enos said.

Most of those topping the list of best-looking senators were male - the highest-scoring woman was 76-year-old Elizabeth Dole, who came in 14th place.

At the time of the study, President Obama was already too well known, the professor said, so they were only able to size up Joe Biden. He scored in the 62nd percentile.

'So, if the election were decided on looks, it would be no contest,' Professor Enos said.

'Fortunately for Obama and Biden, the election is not decided by looks. As we point out in our paper associated with the study, most of the correlation between candidate appearance and election outcomes is probably spurious.'

Bad News: At the time of the study, President Obama was already too well known, the professor said, so they were only able to size up Joe Biden. He scored in the 62nd percentile

They ascertain that very few voters will cast their ballot based solely on looks alone, and even if they become more attractive during a race, it will only gain them 3.5. percentage points.

'Rather than good looks directly affecting voters’ decisions, it is likely that good looking people like Romney have a lot of success in life, obtain significant human capital - education, career success, education - and because of all they have to lose, they are strategic about which races they enter,' Professor Enos said.
