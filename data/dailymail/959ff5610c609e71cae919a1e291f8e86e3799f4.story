First, there was the Undateables, the Channel 4 show that helped people living with disabilities to find love and gave the nation a glimpse of the difficulties they face.

Now a new dating show, Man Up, aims to do the same for men who lack the confidence to speak to women, whether because of cultural reasons, a fear of rejection or simply because they just don't know where to start.

One man who's no stranger to all three is Atul Rana, 36, who has been single all his life, barring a brief relationship when he was a student.

Looking for love: Atul Rana, 36, says he would like to fall in love but admits that he isn't sure how to get started

'It's 90 per cent due to cultural conditioning because I was brought up in the Indian system until I was 15,' he explains. 'My parents were in an arranged marriage and I was brought up to expect one too.'

His life changed dramatically when his parents, both diplomats, returned home to India leaving him behind to attend university in Newcastle.

'The cultural adjustment from conservative Indian to liberal Western is huge,' he admits. 'I like the idea of falling in love but despite all my attempts, I don't actually know what to do.'

Both nervous of rejection and worried about the impact a love-match might have on his conservative family, Atul says matters are made worse by his lack of experience - both in and out of bed.

'[Being a virgin] is one of the things that worries me the most,' he admits. 'It's a 
sensitive topic and quite hard for me to talk about.

Support: Atul lives with and provides for his mother and sister who moved in after his father's death

Take Me Out (ITV)

ITV's flagship dating show lets men do their best to impress the assembled panel of women in a bid to win a date on the legendary Isle of Fernandos (really Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife).

Although most of the more embarrassing parts fall to the men, they are at least guaranteed a date - unlike the women who remain on the panel until they're 'chosen'.

Not great for dating advice but very entertaining.

Snog Marry Avoid (BBC3)

The cult BBC show focuses on the physical side of romance; transforming bizarrely dressed boys and girls into natural beauties.

Brilliant if you need help with dressing for dates, highlights include the punk with pink hair who turned out to be a Jennifer Lawrence lookalike and 'Scotland's No. 1 Male Barbie' who was a rather handsome chap underneath the make-up.

The Undateables (Channel 4)

An utterly heartwarming foray into the world of dating for the disabled.

Whether they have Asperger's, dwarfism or Tourette's Syndrome, participants are helped to find a partner who won't be put off by their differences.

The best part? When the men and women featured finally realise that they aren't undateable after all.

'In 
India, it was the norm and the honourable thing to do. Here it's 
something to be ashamed of. It's like you're not complete as a man. 
People make fun of you.'

Since filming the show, which, along with style and dating advice, gives participants the chance to talk through their problems, Atul has been on four dates but is yet to find the right person for him.

'I used to find dating nerve wracking and I still do,' he admits. 'There's the unfamiliarity about what's going to happen.'

His Indian upbringing has also had an impact because, as Atul explains, expectations are very different.

'In India, when you meet a girl, you're going to marry her so a first date is very serious. When I came here, I felt it distracted me from reality that it's a numbers game - some people you get on well with, and others you don't.

What the show made me realise is that it is just a first date - it's no big deal and it's not going to lead to anything unless you like each other.'

He has also finally plucked up the courage to tell his mother that he doesn't want an arranged marriage, despite pressure from the rest of his family.

'My father died seven-and-a-half years ago,' he explains. 'When I went to India for the funeral, I found out that my dad had been setting me up to get married to a girl there.

'It was hard because I was devastated about his death but my extended family were there saying that it was his last wish and that I should do it. Since then, my mother has set up other girls as well.

He adds: 'I would love to marry eventually but I want it to be for love - not because it was arranged.

'When I told her, my mother was disappointed but she accepted it. Deep in her heart she knew that I had become so Westernised that it would happen anyway.'

Now with what Atul describes as a '100 per cent block' removed, he's hoping his new-found confidence will give him the courage to find the girl of his dreams.

'I have to meet a few more girls to find out exactly what I
 like in a girl,' he smiles, adding: 'But from the four girls I've met, I think someone who is quite 
intelligent would be good.

Help is at hand: The team behind Man Up aim to give under-confident men the self-esteem boost they need

Ringing the changes: Atul hopes that his appearance on Man Up will help him overcome his difficulties

'At least someone of reasonable intelligence and with a bit 
of arty flair, because I'm a musician. Pretty too obviously!'

And what does he have to give in return? 'I'm
 quite intelligent, very ambitious, very persistent and brave,' he muses.

'Doing 
this [the TV show] isn't easy. And I'm a very open minded and happy person.'

He's also got some advice for other men in his situation, suggesting that they too are honest with their families about their wish to date women who aren't a part of their culture.

'I would say tell your family you want to
 date someone outside your culture and be very honest with them,' he advises.

'If you 
feel ashamed about it, any girl you try to date or chat to will sense it
 and it's going to limit you severely. Just don't be ashamed of it.'

He hopes too, that people will become a little more understanding of the challenges faced by those adapting to dating across the cultural divide.

'I
hope the people who watch will respect me for being brave about [dating] and I think they 
will get a real, real deep understanding of how much of a challenge it 
is for people to make a 180 degree turn from their culture.

'British 
values are very liberal and it's difficult to adapt.' He adds: 'I feel like a teenager and am starting 
completely from the beginning.

'I just want to go slowly and do things on my own terms and so that will take a while. Before I 
wouldn't ask for a date because I was scared of getting rejected and I still do get rejected but I'm learning to pick myself up and get on 
with it.'

Atul appears on Man Up, which starts on Tuesday 4th March, 9pm on FOX
