The constant drone of traffic, music and televisions in modern society is fuelling a rise in demand for anti-depressants and sleeping pills, warns a noise expert.

Dr Bernie Krause, who studies the impact of human-generated noise on animals, said the effect of noise on our bodies is far greater than we think.

It was driving many to take pills for stress and to help them sleep, he added.

Dr Krause said people wrongly believe 
they have adapted to noise but the incessant cacophony of everyday life 
is  making them miserable.

‘When you ask people in a noisy environment, they will always say they have adapted to it,’ he told the Cheltenham Science Festival.

‘But I see so many people reliant on so much medication to keep stress levels down and to make them sleep at night. People are in denial. None know that noise is having an effect on them.

‘We think we are well adjusted but studies which have looked at heart rate and blood pressure show something different. We are bothered by it a great deal.’

Dr Krause, a musician who  pioneered the use of the synthesiser in the 1960s, has spent  decades on his research.

Since 1968, the American has recorded 4,500 hours of ‘soundscapes’ – the noises created by animals in a specific habitat – and found that around half of them no longer exist because of the intrusion of human noise.

His claims are supported by research in December which  suggests that repetitive, persistent noise may have particular long-term impact on the brains of the under-twos.

Scientists from Yale University warned that even low sound, such as a TV on quietly, may cause harm if left on for long spells.

Neurologist Dr Jaime Grutzendler said persistent noise for more than ten hours a day may stop blood vessels forming.

He said it was ‘a public health issue which should be taken seriously’.
