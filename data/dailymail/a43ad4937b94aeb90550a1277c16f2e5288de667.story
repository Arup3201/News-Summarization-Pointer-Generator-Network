A British student survived for eight nights on a mountain in Turkey by eating insects and sheltering in a cave.

David Mackie, 21, went missing with two Dutch friends after the trio became lost in bad weather and flooding, during what was supposed to be a one-day hiking trip on January 11.

Mr Mackie and fellow students Frisko De Vries and Merije De Groot, all 21, finally managed to get a signal on his mobile phone five days later and made an emergency call to summon help.

By then, the handset had just two per cent battery left.

Marije de Groot, 21, from the Netherlands, received a hug from a relative after the trio were taken to the Kemer district of Antalya, Turkey, following their rescue. They survived a week on the mountain without any food

Dutchman Frisko De Vries, also 21, also looked relieved to be reunited with loved ones after the trio were brought back to safety. They were rescued after eight days on the mountain after finding mobile phone signal

Briton David Mackie (above), from Nottinghamshire, said finding phone signal 'probably saved our lives'. He said the trio survived on the mountain for a week by drinking water from the springs and eating insects

The trio were last seen in Turkey's touristic long-distance footpath The Lycian Way, which is approximately 540km long and stretches from the Aegean Sea coast to the Mediterranean region. Pictured: Frisko De Vries

The group were taken to hospital following their rescue but all were released without any serious injuries

The trio, who were studying in Istanbul, were rescued and airlifted to safety on Monday in a mission captured on head cam.

Speaking afterwards, Mr Mackie, from Nottinghamshire, said: ‘That phone call probably saved our lives.’

The group had survived on rainwater as they attempted to follow a dry river bed to safety, before retreating to a cave when the riverbed suddenly flooded and nearly washed them away.

Mr Mackie was taken to hospital following the drama on the Lycian Way long-distance path in Antalya. He suffered no serious injuries and has now been discharged.

The student told reporters in Turkey the trio chose to fly to Antalya because the local area offered some of the best hiking routes in the country.

He added: ‘We got to a point where a valley stopped us from going any further. We tried to turn back but the riverbed was full because of the rain, so we couldn’t turn back.

‘After that, it was a matter of trying to cross the river, trying to eat what we could. 

Mr Mackie (right) said the ordeal left them all ‘extremely hungry and exhausted,' but they are now recovering

They were located by a coastguard helicopter after managing to find mobile phone signal five days after going missing. It took rescuers a couple of days to trace them before they were rescued from the mountain

‘This was seven days without (proper) food. We ate a few ants and things like that and drank spring water from the mountains.’

He said the group could hear traffic and the call to prayer from a nearby town, but were ‘so high up that there was no way down.'

The ordeal left the trio ‘extremely hungry and exhausted’, he added.

His parents, Christopher and Alison, both 54, had also raised the alarm after Mr Mackie had failed to catch a flight back to Istanbul. 

Their son was finally able to make the emergency call on Friday, five days after the group set out on the hike. 

Searches began in a bid to locate the group, with hundreds of local people joining the rescue effort, but it was not until Monday that the friends were finally located.

By then, Mr and Mrs Mackie had flown out to Turkey.

Parents of the rescued hikers thanked the Turkish authorities for the 'absolute dedication' in finding them

The family are expected back in Radcliffe-on-Trent, near Nottingham, today.

His sister Hannah Mackie, 22, told the BBC the family were still in shock over what happened.

She said: ‘It’s been the worst week of my life... we’re so relieved, we’re still in disbelief.

‘You don’t think it’s going to happen to you.’

Her father has thanked the Turkish authorities ‘for their absolute dedication in finding’ his son.
