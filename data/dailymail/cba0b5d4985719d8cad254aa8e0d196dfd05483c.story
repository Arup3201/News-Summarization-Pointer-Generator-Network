The parents of a 19-year-old South Carolina college student who died in September under mysterious circumstances took to social media this week to warn other families about the danger of fraternities.

The body of Clemson University freshman Tucker Hipps was found submerged in the Seneca River September 22, hours after his brothers at the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity reported him missing.

It is believed the pledge class president fell off a 20ft bridge into the water during a pre-dawn run and died after hitting his head on rocks. 

Cautionary tale: Gary and Cindy Hipps, the parents of 19-year-old Clemson University freshman Tucker Hipps who died in a fall from a bridge in September, posted this message on Facebook warning families about fraternities 

Seeking the truth: His parents, Gary and Cindy Hipps, have been searching for answers about their son's untimely passing

His parents, Gary and Cindy Hipps, have been searching for answers about their son's untimely passing, which they suspect may have been related to hazing.

On Wednesday, Fox Carolina reported the parents took to Facebook, sharing a powerful image depicting Cindy and Gary standing next to a large white cross bearing their late son's name.

The picture was accompanied by the following message: 'A warning to parents of college students who want to pledge a fraternity. Everyone please feel free to share.'

As of Friday morning, the heart-rending photo has been shared 760 times.

Speaking to GreenvilleOnline.com just before Christmas, Cindy Hipps said they are still ‘actively pursuing the truth’ in their son's case.

The parents explained that they have not heard anything from their son's fraternity or the university in about a month.

A day before Tucker's parents posted the message on Facebook, Oconee County Sheriff Mike Crenshaw told The State that tips were continuing to come in about the events surrounding the freshman’s death, and that investigators were still working the case in hopes of bringing closure to Tucker’s family.

While the sheriff' was short on details, he did say traditions of Sigma Phi Epsilon’s runs across the Lake Hartwell bridge were part of the ongoing probe.

The Sheriff's Office also was analyzing data obtained from cell phones, laptops and social media.

In November, Mr and Mrs Hipps gave an emotional interview accusing their late son's fraternity brothers of withholding information about that fateful night in September.  

'That's a horrible thing to hold inside, it's going to affect you for life,' Mrs Hipps told Fox Carolina. 'It's going to affect all of your relationships. It's going to affect your school, it will affect how you deal with things. It might not feel so bad right now, but as time goes on it gets worse and worse. Truth, the power of truth sets you free.'

The incident is still under investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and Oconee County Sheriff's Office. They are not speaking about the case until their final report is published, with will include toxicology results.

Tucker's death is even more tragic considering his parents warned him against joining a fraternity, preferring he spend his time in college focusing on his studies. But they relented since he was a social young man and students in Greek Life organization do, on average, maintain higher grade-point averages.

Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities. It's unclear if that's suspension is still in place 

Tucker apparently fell from this bridge into the waters of the Senca River. Police are still investigating the incident, and will not be commenting on the case until they release their full report, including toxicology reports 

The Hipps also hope their son's death will help bring change to the fraternity pledging process. Tucker pictured above with an unidentified young woman on the left

 'I told him I'm not going to say you can't do it but I am not going to pay for it,' Mr Hipps told WSPA.

Just four days before he died, Tucker's parents had dinner with him, and they saw that the pledging process noticeably taking a toll.

'I can tell you that last time I saw him he was both tired and worn out he looked like he hadn't had much sleep,' his dad said. 'It was hard and I asked him I said are you feeling okay are you doing alright?'

Following Tucker's death, Clemson University suspended all Greek Life activities for two weeks. Last month, the university put together a task force to address drunkenness and hazing at fraternities and sororities. 

'There seems to be something systemically wrong with the pledging process, and how kids are put through the things they are put through,' Mr Hipps said, adding that he is not 'making any friends'  in the Greek community as he searches for answers in his son's death.
