Putting yourself out onto the dating scene can be a daunting prospect. But one woman suffered perhaps the ultimate dating embarrassment.

Janet Curry, 38, from Witney, Oxford, was left humiliated after a man she met on a dating website told her that she was too fat to date.

But far from being crushed by the cruel comment or abandoning her quest for romance, Janet used it as motivation to lose over 11st, transform her life, and ultimately find love.

Having struggled with her weight all her adult life (left, at 22st 7lb), it look a strangers comment to motivate Janet to tackle her size, adopt a healthy eating regime and lose over 11st (right) 

At 22st 7lb and a size 30, the professional make-up artist had spent years overeating 

Janet said: 'I'd always been big, and over the years my weight had spiralled out of control to a point where I barely recognised myself.

'After going through a painful divorce, I was keen to find love again, so joining Plenty of Fish was a big step for me.

'When my date admitted that I was just too large for him to go out with, it made me realise that I was putting both my health and my future happiness at risk.'

When she married her ex-husband Neil, 38, in 2004, Janet was 18st and a size 24 and her weight rose further after the wedding

Mother-of-one Janet had spent most of her adult life struggling with her weight. When she married her ex-husband Neil, 38, in 2004, she was 18st and a size 24.

But after experiencing two devastating miscarriages and developing a painful digestive disorder called Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction (a condition where the muscle between the pancreas and lower intestine fails), her weight soared to  22st 7lb.

Forced to give up a her job as a retail operations manager because of her ill health, Janet began gorging on chocolate sponge puddings, brioche and family-sized bars of chocolate.

Her size also left her too tired to play with her eight-year-old son, Joseph.

Janet said: 'I felt like a failure. And I felt even worse when Joseph came home from school one day and told me that one of the children in his class had said that my bottom was the size of a planet. I was absolutely mortified.

'My confidence was at an all-time low, and my relationship with Neil was suffering too. He'd never said anything about my weight, but over time we had drifted apart.'

In a bid to save her marriage, Janet lost an impressive 4st and slimmed down to a size 20. But the pressures of her illness and her tragic miscarriages proved too much, and the couple split amicably in June 2012.

Two months later, Janet felt ready to move on and joined the online dating website, Plenty of Fish.

Determined to make a change Janet threw out all her junk food and bought a hypnosis book and tape

Embarrassed about her size, she cropped her profile picture so that it only revealed her face.

With the compliments of 'stunning' and 'beautiful' rolling in, Janet felt a new lease of confidence and accepted several date offers.

But when she met up with her dates in person, it was a different story.

Janet said: 'We'd arrange to meet for a coffee, and everything would be fine. But as soon as I walked into the cafe, their eyes would widen in shock when they realised how big I was.

'It was so humiliating. I could tell that they couldn't wait to leave, and then of course I never heard from them again.

Janet swapped takeaways and fizzy drinks for wholesome, low fat and home cooked foods to drop the pounds

Janet says that losing weight has completely changed her life, and she feels so much better about herself

'One guy told me that I was just too big for him to date, whilst another said he only went for 'smaller' girls. I know they were just being honest, but it was really hurtful.'

Determined to continue to lose weight and transform her body, Janet threw away all of the junk food from her cupboards and bought a hypnosis book and CD.

Breakfast: Nothing 

Lunch: Sandwich, crisps, cake and Coke

Snacks: Family-sized bar of Galaxy chocolate, crisps, chocolate brioche

Dinner: Chinese takeaway, chocolate sponge pudding

Breakfast: Poached egg with a slice of wholemeal toast

Lunch: Ryvita with low-fat cream cheese and salmon

Dinner: Steak, jacket potato and vegetables

In just five months, after eating three balanced meals a day and plenty of fruit and vegetables, Janet lost an impressive 3st.

Today she weighs a svelte 11st - taking her total weight loss to a massive 11st 7lb, and is a healthy size 12.

Better still, she has found love with car transporter driver, Paul Johnson, 45.

Janet said: 'Losing weight has completely changed my life, and I feel so much better about myself.

'I'm a firm believer that beauty comes from the inside, but changing myself on the outside has made me a better person. I am healthier and more confident, and I know I'm setting a good example for my son.

'Paul is always telling me how beautiful he thinks I am and for the first time in my life, I actually feel it.'
