A Sergeant and a Corporal have been given lengthy military jail sentences after a soldier died when he was shot in the neck during a training exercise.

Corporal Colin Bell and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price have also been thrown out of the army following Fusilier James Wilkinson's death in Kenya.

A judge today ruled that the death of the serviceman from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers had been 'wholly and utterly avoidable'.

When he died, Fsl Wilkinson, 21, and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops.

Bell had taken the barrel of a machine gun that had become jammed and while inspecting the weapon it fired, hitting Fsl Wilkinson in the neck.

The court heard that Bell, 29, and Price had failed to follow procedure by failing to call an armourer to fix the weapon.

He removed the barrel as it pointed directly at Fsl Wilkinson when he was just a few feet away when the weapon went off, hitting the father-to-be who was described as having 'long term potential'.

Mrs Wilkinson told the court: 'I felt that James had been my fairytale ending but all the hopes and dreams we shared can now never happen'

Price, of the 
Adjutant General's Corp, attached to the Scots Dragoon Guards, was a 
safety supervisor on the Ex Askari Thunder exercise.

He failed to intervene and was found guilty of negligently performing a duty. Bell pleaded guilty to the same charge at an earlier hearing.

Judge Advocate Michael today sentenced Price for 14 months and Bell for 21 months in military detention.

Judge Elsom said: 'The tragic death  of this young soldier should never have happened, and only happened because you two failed to carry out your duties properly.

'Nothing can ever bring that young 
husband, father and son back to life, nor can this court do anything to 
lessen the impact of loss on his family.

'Both of you will live for the rest of
 your lives knowing that what you did on that fateful day led to the 
wholly and utterly avoidable death of a young soldier.

'You have both served a long time in the army and know the dangers of potentially unsafe conditions.

'Safety supervisors have primacy on ranges and should not defer to anyone, regardless of rank.

'We have found you equally culpable in
 what occurred. Each of you have substantial experience as soldiers and 
held the rank of non-commissioned officers.

'You, Price, could have prevented what
 happened if you carried out your duties properly. Each of you 
demonstrated a high degree of negligence which resulted in tragic 
consequences.'

At the time of his death, Fsl Wilkinson's widow, Sarah, was pregnant with their first daughter and they had only got married five months earlier.

She welcomed the sentence and today said: 'This is the best possible outcome we could have got, that James could have got.

'To hear that the judge and panel really took it seriously, when they could have written it off as a mistake, felt really good.'

Fsl Wilkinson joined the Army in February 2010 and was trained at Catterick, North Yorkshire, before being stationed in Germany where he lived with his new wife for just three days.

Mrs Wilkinson, who has a son called Connor who doted on Fsl Wilkinson, told the court: 'I felt that James had been my fairytale ending but all the hopes and dreams we shared can now never happen.

'James had often talked about seeing our unborn daughter take her first steps on the beach in Cyprus.

'I deeply regret that our daughter never got to meet her wonderful father and he has missed seeing her first steps and hearing her first words.

'The moment my daughter first wrapped her fingers around my finger it was heartbreaking knowing he will never get to do that.

'I do not get excited about anything and feel my life was taken away from me the day he died.'

Fusilier Wilkinson's parents Jan and Rob Wilkinson say they 'cannot accept' their firstborn son's death on exercise.

Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Since he died all the days have blurred into one. I cannot differentiate one from the other - grief has overtaken us all.

When he died, Fsl Wilkinson, 21, and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops

'We still cannot believe the ranks and responsibilities of the senior soldiers involved: a Staff Sergeant and a Corporal, not junior and inexperienced troops.

'I appreciate that a lot of work has gone into bringing these two men to justice but whatever sentence they receive will never be enough.

'I cannot accept how James died. If he had died in operations I could understand. The exercise should have been stopped three times but no one took the trouble to stop it.'

Mark Ashley, mitigating for Bell, said the married father-of-two was 'deeply sorry' for his 'mistake', but he had acted to allow the exercise to carry on.

Bell, who served for 11 years, placed the machine gun on his knee, pointing at a bank of earth, to deal with the fault but it slipped off his knee, Mr Ashley said.

He was sentenced to 14 months in a military detention centre. Price, who served for 25 years, was due to be promoted to Sergeant Major later this year. he was sentenced to 21 months.

He failed to stop the gun being moved and the original drill, Andrew Jackson said in mitigation.

Sarah Wilkinson met James at a party in March 2010. Their daughter Annabel was born in February last year.
