New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced today that the marathon will take place on Sunday despite earlier rumors that the race would be delayed.

'The marathon will go on,' Mr Bloomberg said Wednesday. 'Most of the power will be back if not all of it.'

There are still concerns, however, that many of the 50,000 runners won't be able to make it to the start line at Staten Island, as New York's subway system is flooded, the Staten Island Ferry is suspended and many flights to the city's airports cancelled.

Closed: The Staten Island Ferry terminal at Battery Park in lower Manhattan will be used by about half of the 50,000 runners in Sunday's New York City Marathon

Carnage: A station on the Staten Island Railway covered in debris in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. It is unknown whether public transport will be back to normal by Sunday

Runners have been given until Saturday to cancel their entry.

'The marathon is much more than a race and once again it's so true this year as was the case after 9/11, to deliver an event that can aid New York City's recovery,' Mary Wittenberg, the New York Road Runners president and CEO, said to USA Today.

Up to 20,000 international runners could be affected by flight cancellations and delays, though Wittenburg said the organisation had 'a number of options to get them into any of our surrounding airports.'

There was a positive sign on Wednesday morning with the re-opening of JFK and Newark airports.

The group said that any runners unable to reach Manhattan would be entered into next year's race, though entry fees would not be refunded.

About half of the runners will reach the start via the Staten Island Ferry from the Battery and though the service should be operational, it is by no means guaranteed that Subway trains to the Battery will be.

The start line on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is elevated but the first portion of the course in Brooklyn, along Fourth Avenue, isn't far from areas flooded on Monday night.

Similarly, there could be problems when the course passes through Queens, close to the East River.

The finish line is in Central Park, which will remain closed until the debris and fallen trees are cleared away.

The route does not include lower Manhattan, which saw the worst of the flooding caused by the 13ft storm surges which lashed the city on Monday and Tuesday.

However, with thousands of New Yorkers still without electricity, it will be a challenge to restore power to timing equipment.

As of Wednesday morning, there were 22 confirmed fatalities in the city as a result of the storm.

The race's 'Health & Fitness Expo' is still scheduled to go ahead from Thursday despite being located at the Javits Center, which sits in an area of Manhattan that was subject to compulsory evacuation. Organisers were testing equipment in the building on Tuesday.
