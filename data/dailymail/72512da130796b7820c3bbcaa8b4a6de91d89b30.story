Brendan Rodgers admitted he is fighting to save his job after Liverpool’s disastrous 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace.

Rodgers admitted he has held talks with his club's American owners over a dramatic slump in form that has left them 18 points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea.

Former Liverpool defender and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher was scathing in his assessment of the performance and labelled the team ‘mentally, physically weak’, adding that they lack ‘leadership’.

Rodgers, who later hinted at issues within the dressing room, admitted: ‘I’m not arrogant enough to think I am safe from anything.

‘Any manager will tell you that you have to win games and get results, particularly after the way we have been developing as a club.

‘I have great communication with the owners. We’ve been honest enough with each other and we have to get results.

‘You have to perform. Owners and directors and chairmen have to see development on the field.

‘Barring this period, our development has been very good and fast. But there's no doubt you have to get results.

‘That will support the confidence to the owners, and you take it from there. I will only ever do my best.

‘The best has seen us develop well. Now I must fight even harder. The full responsibility comes down to me.

‘Now I have to fight even harder and take the responsibility. As manager, the responsibility comes down to me and any pressure comes on to me.’

Liverpool took the lead inside two minutes when Rickie Lambert, in the team because Mario Balotelli apparently has a groin injury, beat Julian Speroni.

Dwight Gayle, who scored twice in the famous 3-3 draw at Selhurst Park against Liverpool last season, equalised for Palace in the first half.

Joe Ledley put Palace in front and captain Mile Jedinak scored a sensational free-kick to finish the visitors off.

Carragher, who was critical of the Liverpool team after their failure to hold on to a 3-0 lead here last season, was brutal in his assessment.

The Anfield legend said: ‘Something's not right, they're getting bullied out of games. At the end of last season, when they came here, we said they were mentally, physically weak - same again. Nothing's changed.

‘No matter the £120million spent on players, [Luis] Suarez has gone - so what? Suarez has gone. They are still mentally weak, there is no leadership on the pitch.

‘As a Liverpool fan, which I am - I don't care about being neutral on TV - what I'm saying is as a fan when you're watching your own team, the worst thing you can ever be throwing at your own team or think of them is they are being bullied or being weak and that's what we've seen today from Liverpool, and not for the first time.

Rodgers endured another damp ending to a weekend as he watched his side capitulate 

‘It has been going on all season and we're saying, “New players, give them time to adjust” - I'm not a big believer in that.

‘I've never moved club, and when a foreign player comes in it takes a bit of time to adapt but we're getting to the stage now where you want to start seeing performances.

‘Liverpool aren't getting beat by quality, they're getting bullied. They're getting beaten by enthusiasm from Crystal Palace.’

Rodgers faces another massive test in the Champions League this week when they travel to Bulgaria to face Ludogorets before returning to England to face Stoke City at Anfield.

He also hinted at issues within the dressing room after the departure of Luis Suarez last summer.

The Liverpool manager said: ‘We've been a very close group for a couple of years, but we had to make the changes and bring players in. The group was very thin.

‘We're in another transition phase, but whatever phase it is we have to do better than that. We've brought in very good players.’

Rodgers, who came within two points of landing the Premier League title last season, admitted confidence is low.

He added: ‘Palace have a simple game-plan, to concede the ball and play on the counter-attack. What we've got as a model of a football club is to bring in young players.

‘This is a group doing their best, but they're just not quite firing. Their confidence is low.

‘But we need to find a way. They're very talented players, but it's been a new phase this season: a lot of games, a lot less preparation time in terms of coaching, key injuries.

‘It's my responsibility as the manager, ultimately. I put the team out there, the best team to win us the game.'

Rodgers also replied abruptly when he was quizzed about Mario Balotelli’s presence at the Liverpool Arena on Saturday night to watch the boxing. Balotelli missed the clash with injury.

The Liverpool manager added: ‘He came back from the Italian squad and the groin was still sore. We'll assess that over the next few days.

‘He was obviously free. No issue. He wasn't out too late and he was in for treatment.’
