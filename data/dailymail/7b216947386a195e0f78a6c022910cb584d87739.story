The Ministry of Defence has told soldiers to take a month off work over the festive period - in order to cut heating and lighting bills at army barracks.

Military chiefs have reportedly instructed personnel heading home for the holidays on Friday to not return until January 5, and in some cases longer.

The move is understood to be a cost-saving measure in response to defence cuts. Many of the UK's bases have older buildings and thus inefficient to heat.

About 100 barracks will have minimal staff over Christmas to provide security and other essential services.

A military source told the Daily Telegraph the Army had 'encouraged' commanders to give soldiers an extra week off, although they admit many soldiers may have extra holiday remaining following the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The MoD says no official order was given to close the bases, but did not deny that the extra week was effectively being taken by thousands of soldiers, as well as Navy, RAF and civilian workers.

Col Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, told the newspaper: 'This really does send out a message about the parlous state of our finances at the moment.'

Vernon Coaker, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said: 'It smacks of a decision made on the hoof with no hint of any strategy to save costs in the long term.'

Last month Britain's top military officer General Sir Nicholas Houghton said areas of the Ministry of Defence budget are likely to come under pressure in a new round of spending cuts after the general election, whoever is in power.

Sir Nicholas also told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme there had been some 'early glitches' in the attempt to recruit 30,000 Army reservists to plug the gap left by cuts to regular troops.

The government wants to expand the Army Reserve to 30,000 by 2018, to offset cuts of 20,000 in full-time manpower.

But an Army spokesman told MailOnline: ‘It is totally wrong to suggest that the Army is shutting down over Christmas with skeleton staff.

‘Leave periods are at the discretion of local commanders and many units are allowing personnel an extra week over the Christmas period to offset accumulated leave following busy operational commitments.

‘However, all Army bases will continue to be manned appropriately and security levels will always be maintained.’
