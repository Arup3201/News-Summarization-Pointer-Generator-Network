The Burberry show is literally the only time of the year I wish spring and summer would just b***** off out of the way so we could fast forward to winter again.

Christopher Bailey's sumptuous collections, at once classic and quirky, are always alluring, and that's without the beautiful location in Kensington Gardens, the epic soundtrack (this year pounding piano and piercing lyrics by Ed Harcourt, Paloma Faith and Rhodes) and the stellar front row (Harry Styles, cute as a Burberry button in forest green suede trench, was the highlight).

Oh yes - and the models, always the cream of the fashion week crop, including longtime Burberry family member Cara Delevingne along with Suki Waterhouse, Jourdan Dunn, Charlotte Wiggins and Malaika Firth.

Prints: Geometric prints, florals and a dash of Apache on the runway at Burberry. Plus: bags are oversized again, yes!

Back to the clothes though, and THAT 
blanket coat... Bailey sent out all his models wearing wool blanket 
ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned in a sort 
of Bauhaus Mondrian-inspired geometric way, or with Apache-style zig 
zags.

Each one was 
monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it (indeed, front 
row fodder Cat Deeley, who named it as her favourite piece from the 
show, had her eye on Cara Delevingne's).

Raise Your Love - by Rhodes

Only Love Can Hurt Like This - by Paloma Faith

There were blanket coats, too, equestrian blanket scarves, relaxed trenches and trench coat ponchos.

Elsewhere,
 bold nature-inspired prints were emblazoned on dresses and silk 
scarves, silk cotton organdy dresses were handpainted, while flowers were painted on buttersoft shoes.

The show, called The Bloomsbury Girls, took inspiration from the British decorative art of the Bloomsbury set and Charleston, the country home and meeting place for the writers, painters and intellectuals who formed the group.

It was an explosion of rich, yet natural, colour: elderberry, cameo pink, blackcurrant, slate blue, antique rose, russet red ink blue, bottle green, burnt amber, olive, amethyst, larch yellow, camel, black amethyst... the list goes on.

And it was lapped up by a stellar front row that included Harry Styles, 
Tinie Tempah, Laura Mvula, Lianne La Havas, actors Bradley Cooper, 
Naomie Harris, Jamie 
Campbell Bower, film producer Harvey Weinstein,
photographer Mario Testino, as well as Greg James, Cat Deeley, Olivia Palermo and Poppy Delevingne. Phew. 

Nature-inspired: The palette was watercolour cool, and while some prints were soft, they were juxtaposed with the more graphic prints of Apache embroidery in earthy hues

We
 know that what Christopher Bailey does best is to take the traditional 
and stamp it with his own mischievous fingerprint - and here that 
surfaced in the shape of intricate handmade black lace given a saucy 
twist, used to create sheer dresses that afforded a glimpse of lingerie 
underneath. Naughty, but very nice.

Speaking
 to MailOnline after the show, Poppy Delevingne, who was, of course, 
dressed head-to-toe in Burberry, said: ‘I thought the show was amazing, I
 almost burst into tears! It was so beautiful. It was so cool seeing my 
sister Cara leading the brigade, kind of amazing really.

‘I have enjoyed London Fashion Week so much, it’s my favourite of them all.'

Soft: Prints were painterly, with pastel tones and broad brushstrokes. Make-up was natural but powerful - a deep rose petal stain on lips and dusky pink eyes. From left, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Jourdan Dunn

Cosy chic: Cara Delevingne led the models in the finale of the show, with each one wearing the monogrammed blanket shawl set to be a blockbuster this A/W

Cosy: The monogrammed blankets as seen on Cara (l) will be top of every fashionista's wishlist this year, while Suki wrapped up in sheepskin and Edie Campbell modelled an illustrated super trench

Colourful: The collection was bolder in print 
than we are used to from Burberry, with stylised nature-inspired motifs 
on wool coats and silk scarves

Roll on winter: Blankets will be in for AW14, rejoice

Woolly army: Cara led the blanket-covered finale, with Edie Campbell as her second-in-command
