Claims: Jamie Kuntz says he was kicked of the North Dakota State College of Science football team for being gay

An 18-year-old freshman linesman has claimed he was kicked off a college football team for kissing his boyfriend, 65, in a press box.

Jamie Kuntz was told he was dismissed because he lied about his actions, but he believes the real reason was because it was a gay kiss.

He has since left North Dakota State College of Sciences in Wahpeton which he attended on a partial football scholarship.

North Dakota State College of 
Sciences in Wahpeton acknowledges Mr Kuntz was disciplined by the team, but
says it wasn't because he is gay.

Football coach Chuck Parsons told Mr
Kuntz in a letter that he was removed from the team for lying about the 
kiss.

Mr Kuntz said he and his Boyfriend were in the press box at the game against Snow College in 
Pueblo, Colo., over Labor Day weekend.

Mr Kuntz was videotaping the game for 
the team.

His Wildcats were down by more than 40 points when 'the kiss 
just happened,' he said.

The team would eventually lose 63-17.

'People around here aren't exposed to
it,' Mr Kuntz said of homosexuality. 'People expect gays to be flamboyant,
not football players.'

A teammate apparently saw the kiss 
and told coaches, Mr Kuntz said.

When Mr Parsons confronted Mr Kuntz on the bus 
ride back to North Dakota, he told him the man he kissed was his 
grandfather.

'I lied,' Mr Kuntz said.

Later, he felt guilty about lying and came clean to his coach.

In
a Sept. 3 dismissal letter Mr Parsons 
told Mr Kuntz he was being ousted from the team under the 'conduct deemed 
detrimental to the team' category outlined in guidelines in the team's 
player's manual.

Mr Parsons specifically noted the manual's section on 
'lying to coaches, teachers or other school staff.'

'This decision was arrived at solely on the basis of your conduct during the football game; and because you chose not to be truthful with me when I confronted you about whom else was in the box with you,' Parsons wrote.

'Any conduct by any member of the program that would cause such a distraction during a game would warrant the same consequences.'

Mr Kuntz doesn't believe he was dismissed just for lying.

'I know if it was a girl in the press box, or even an older woman, nothing would have happened,' he said. 'If it was an older woman, I would have probably been congratulated for it from my teammates.'

School officials said that they were investigating whether this was the first such instance of someone being kicked off the football team for lying.

John Richman, North Dakota State College of Science president, said other players have been kicked off the team for various reasons, though he couldn't say whether any before had been booted specifically for lying.

Mr Richman said he believes Mr Kuntz's case was handled 'fairly and consistently' by the athletic department.

'I'm very confident that with the information that's been provided to me by our football coach, Chuck Parsons, by our athletic director, Stu Engen, that the thought process, the facts that were reviewed, have led them to an appropriate and the right decision in this case,' Mr Richman said yesterday in an interview at the college.

Mr Kuntz said he told his mother that he was gay at the same time he told her he was kicked off the team.

'I'm struggling with it,' said Rita Kuntz, choking back tears.

'I love Jamie and I'm proud of him, but I know what the school did was wrong.'

Mr Kuntz said he met the man online more than a year ago. Kuntz said the man, whom he would not identify, lives in Colorado and the two have met there a few times in recent months.

As far as his football career, Mr Kuntz says he's not giving up. He may pursue it as a walk-on at another university outside North Dakota.

'I miss it already,' he said.
