The troubled Co-operative Bank is to shut around 50 branches as part of a rescue plan.

Investors and hedge funds will take control of the bank in an attempt to plug a £1.5 billion black hole in its finances.

The bank ran into trouble after buying the Britannia Building Society and a later-abandoned attempt to buy hundreds of Lloyds Bank branches.

The Co-Operative group will only keep a 30 per cent stake in the bank, but insists its ethical practices will remain embedded in the firm

The deal will see Co-operative Group lose overall control of its banking arm, which has traded on its reputation for ethical behaviour, and retain just a 30 per cent stake.

The funerals-to-supermarkets group had initially hoped to retain control of the ethical lender by giving bond investors a minority stake in return for a £500 million loss on their debt.

But bondholders, including US hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management and Silver Point Capital, will take control of the bank under the new plan, which will see it listed on the stock market next year.

The Co-op's loss of control of the bank has raised concerns among some customers. The bank has traditionally attracted organisations like trade unions and charities because of its ethical approach.

But the Co-op said its values and ethics will be ‘legally embedded’ in the lender's new rules.

Investors must now vote to back the plan, and the Co-op warned that the bank will fall into state hands through the resolution process if they do not, leaving investors empty-handed.

Co-operative Group chief executive Euan Sutherland insists it will retain 'effective control' of the bank as it will be its biggest single shareholder

The group announced plans to close around 50 of its 324 bank branches, about 15 per cent of its estate, without revealing how many jobs will go among the lender's 9,000 staff.

The Co-op has faced tough questions over the impact on the bank's ethical values from the new plan to cede control to predatory US hedge funds and blue-chip investors.

Co-op Group chief executive Euan Sutherland had insisted the group, which traces its roots back to the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844, will retain ‘effective control’ of the bank as it will be its biggest single shareholder.

He said last month the co-operative principles will be embedded in the constitution of the bank.

Mr Sutherland said today: 'We recognise the huge importance of ethics and values for all our customers and remain committed to upholding them.'

Its turnaround is expected to take four to five years, and will shift its focus to households and small and medium-sized businesses.

The Co-op added that the bank's outlook remains 'challenging', although monthly bad debt charges have fallen.

The Co-op will be the bank's single biggest shareholder, and it insisted no other single shareholders will have more than 9.9 per cent

The Co-op had originally said there would be ‘no plan B’ for its recapitalisation, which would have seen the Co-op retain control through a stock market flotation - a turnaround strategy requiring a £500 million contribution from bondholders, with £1 billion coming from the group.

But bondholders led by US hedge funds Aurelius Capital Management and Silver Point Capital - who own 43% of the higher-ranking bonds which had been due to be hit - ratcheted up the pressure on the bank, proposing an alternative plan of converting more debt into shares.

The new deal is expected to need approval from 80 per cent of shareholders, with a vote set to take place before the year end.

The Co-op Bank's woes have been blamed on soured corporate loans, many of which were acquired with its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 2009.

Retail investors such as pensioners who bought the bank's bonds for a steady income will be offered a choice between two types of bond - one paying income and another repaying the principal they invested - although they will still suffer losses.

Mark Taber, who campaigned for retail investors, said: 'This deal has been extremely hard-fought and is now a much better solution for retail holders and pensioners.'

The Co-op Group will contribute £462 million to the bank's turnaround, including £129 million handed to retail investors, £333 million in cash and £40 million in interest savings.

Investors such as hedge funds will take up to 70 per cent of the bank's equity through a combination of converting debt to shares, buying equity and acquiring fresh bank debt.

The Co-op will be the bank's single biggest shareholder, and it insisted no other single shareholders will have more than 9.9 per cent.

'That will give us a key role in shaping the bank's future direction,' Mr Sutherland added.
