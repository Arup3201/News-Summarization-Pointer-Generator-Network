Frank Lampard led Manchester City's charge against his former club Chelsea at the top of the table after netting the winning goal in the reigning champion's 1-0 defeat of Leicester.

Despite a show of support from the stands, Nigel Pearson's dismal run continued - the Foxes have not won a Premier League game since upsetting Manchester United in September and remain bottom of the table.

 LEICESTER (4-1-4-1)

Ben Hamer 6.5 – Given the task of filling the gloves of injured Kasper Schmeichel and responded well, good on crosses and showed good judgement to keep out an attempted lob by Silva.

Danny Simpson 5.5 – Stuck to his guns but found it difficult to keep up with the pace at which the likes of Silva and Nasri would move the ball. Lucky not to be booked early with a late challenge

Marcin Wasilewski 5.5 – Had built himself up to face the powerhouse Dzeko, instead came up against the quicksilver Pozo after the Bosnian was injured in the warm-up. Handled him well.

Wes Morgan 6 – Had a great battle with Yaya Toure and gave as good as he got. Distribution wasn't the best but he did what he needed to, defend, apart from that one moment when Lampard got clear

Esteban Cambiasso 6.5 – Not surprisingly wasn't overawed by the occasion, having played big World Cup games for Argentina. Protected the Leicester back-four and came so close to scoring with a free-kick

Riyad Mahrez 6 – The Algerian has pace to burn which is why Nigel Pearson wanted him to hug the touchline and run. Run he did and impressively so but nothing came from it.

Andy King 5.5 – Found it hard to get to grips of central midfield with Manchester City's powerhouses Yaya Toure and Fernando. Leicester need to get him creating for the rest of the season

Danny Drinkwater 5.5 – Like King, found it hard to get a foothold in midfield and wasn't at his best from the rare set piece opportunities that went the way of the home side

Jeffrey Schlupp 6.5 – You could see why manager Nigel Pearson wanted him to exploit his pace. Showed the defenders a clean pair of heels on more than one occasion but didn't utilise it

Jamie Vardy 6 – Scored a great goal in the famous 5-3 win against Manchester United and should have scored after sprinting past Mangala. But he didn't convert and was later taken off.

Substitutions: 

Ulloa (for Schlupp 64) 5.5 – Didn't see enough of the ball to make an impact 

Powell (for Vardy 73) 5.5 – Not made a great impact in his loan spell from Manchester United

Knockaert (for Drinkwater 79) Unused subs: Smith (Gk), Hammond, James, Moore

Manager: Nigel Pearson – 6.5

 MANCHESTER CITY

Joe Hart 6 – Seems to have grown in confidence this season with a new long-term deal on the table. His presence alone calmed a shaky defence though he was nearly caught out by Cambiasso's curler

Bacary Sagna 6 – Replaced Pablo Zabaleta and had some uncomortable moments as Schlupp hit his strides. But Pellegrini will be happy how the former Arsenal right-back stuck to his task

Vincent Kompany 6.5 – Looked bulky and not a surprise maybe when he pulled up with a hamstring on his return from a calf injury. But while on the pitch, you can't underestimate his influence on the team, When Leicester got in behind the defence early on, he was the one to cover and make the key interceptions to keep the game at 0-0,

Eliaquim Mangala 6 – His strength is his strength, the way he out-muscled Vardy in front of goal hinted at a £32m defender. Unforunately, there are other flaws and he was turned more than once. While his communication with keeper Hart needs improvement.

Gael Clichy 6 – The injury to Kolarov has given Clichy a sustained run in the team and it has helped his consistency. As probably Manchester City's quickest defender, this was his kind of game

Yaya Toure 7 – Missed the Roma game through suspension and the freshness helped him become one of the key players. Tested Hamer early on with a stinging shot and a menace all over the pitch. An attacking threat without deserting his defensive station - although unfortunate that his worst touch, a wayward shot, struck a supporter.

Fernando 6.5 – This was the type of game Pellegrini signed him for, a tricky away match at a highly-motivated team at the bottom. Fernando got stuck in as you'd expect but he'll have to watch the number of free-kicks he gives away in important areas.

Samir Nasri 6.5 – In a rich vein of form at the moment and timing his passes to perfection. His slide-rule cross for Lampard was an invitation for the former England midfielder to tap in.

Frank Lampard 6.5 - Entrusted with the pivotal No 10 role at the age of 36. Had spells where he did little, but nobody else could have found space in the six-yard box like him to score the opener

David Silva 6 – The little Spanish wizard was welcomed back for the first time since a knee injuring and found his rhythm of passing almost immediately. Narrowly misjudged an attempted lob over Hamer

Jose Angel Pozo 5.5 – Called up just before kick off when Edin Dzeko was injured in the warm up. At 18 he's a talent but the truth is this level is just too intense and competitive for him right now 

Substitutes:

Milner (for Lampard 59) 6.5 – Becoming one of Pellegrini's heroes this season. Slotted in on the left-hand side of midfield for this game and got in some dangerous crosses

Navas (for Pozo 74) 5.5 – Manchester City were more interested in defending for the final 11 minutes
