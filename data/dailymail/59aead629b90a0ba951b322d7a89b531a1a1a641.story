Apple has filed a patent for a pair of headphones that automatically adjust the volume of music if they're not inserted far enough into the ear. 

The tech company has been criticised in the past for the headphones it sells with iPhones and iPods because they 'leak' music, meaning a listener's tunes can be heard by people around them.  

Designs for the in-ear headphones, also known as earbuds, in this latest patent have a built-in microphone that can assess how much much music is leaking and adjust the volume accordingly.

This image, taken from the recently filed Apple patent, shows how the new earbuds would work. When inserted into the ear, a built-in microphone assesses how much music is leaking in and out. If the seal between the bud and the ear canal is broken, the volume will be automatically adjusted accordingly

When inserted into the ear, a built-in microphone assesses how much music is leaking in and out.

It also checks for ambient and background noises.

If the seal between the bud and the ear canal is broken - determined by whether the microphone can pick up a lot of background noise - the volume of the music will be automatically adjusted accordingly.

Alternatively, a warning message will appear on the screen to tell the listener their music isn't at the optimum level.

According to the patent, the buds could track variations in the seal between the speaker section of the earbud and the wearer's ear canal.

If the earbud is not inserted far enough, the microphone will realise the seal has been broken.

The buds will then either warn the listener through an on-screen message, or automatically adjust the volume.

The microphone can also listen to ambient noises and increase the volume if the wearer is in a loud environment.

This adjustment additionally means the earbuds will better fit people's different sized ears.

The patent was filed earlier this month to the U.S Patent and Trademark Office and it will need to be approved before Apple can begin working on, and ultimately selling, the device.

It said: 'The speakers in earbud headphone are encased in earbuds.

The headphones Apple released with early versions of its iPhones and iPods, pictured, didn't fit in the ear properly and customers complained they 'leaked' music. This meant people around them could hear what they were listening to

'During use, the earbuds are placed in the ears of a user. When properly seated in the user's ear, the earbuds form a seal.

'If the seal between the earbuds and the user's ear is formed correctly, music can be played back satisfactorily.

In September 2012, Apple released its EarPods, pictured. They were designed to fit more snugly in the ear in a bid to reduce noise leakage. However, customers complained they were uncomfortable

'Poor seals can adversely affect performance. For example, noise cancellation operations can be degraded and volume levels can be affected.'

Explaining how its earbud design would prevent this, Apple adds: 'In response to measured reductions in seal quality, actions may be taken such as generating informative messages for the user, increasing overall earbud volume, correcting mismatched balance between left and right earbuds, adjusting equalization settings, and making adjustments to noise cancellation circuitry.'

DisplaySearch analyst Paul Grey told Stuff magazine: 'Apple must be careful not to invade or choke off its accessories market – they’ve never made great headphones or accessories.'

The headphones Apple released with the early versions of its iPhones and iPods didn't fit in the ear properly and were renowned for 'leaking' music.

In September 2012, Apple released its EarPods which were first shipped with the iPhone 5.

They were designed to fit more snugly in the ear in a bid to reduce noise leakage.

However, customers complained that they were uncomfortable and still didn't fit properly.
