A Catholic priest, suspended after a Mail on Sunday probe found he was in a sham ‘gay marriage’ with a Pakistani immigrant, has been reinstated.

Father Donald Minchew, 67, was removed from his ministry a year ago after confessing that he entered the civil partnership in 2008 to help the family friend obtain a British passport.

But Church superiors have revealed his partnership has been dissolved and they have been assured the Home Office no longer wants to pursue the matter. 

Return: Father Minchew has been reinstated by church superiors after his civil partnership was dissolved 

In a letter to parishioners last week, prelate Monsignor Keith Newton said he had lifted Fr Minchew’s suspension ‘after much prayer and discussion’.

The Home Office refused to comment. It is not known what happened to Fr Minchew’s ex partner, Mustajab Hussain, 33.

Confronted last year, Fr Minchew, said: ‘You are talking to a ruined man. I am finished.’

Fr Minchew, who had been based at St Mary’s Church, Croydon, could not be reached for comment.
