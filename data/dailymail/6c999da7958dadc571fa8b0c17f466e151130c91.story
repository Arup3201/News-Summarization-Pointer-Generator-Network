Host commentator

Just as Barcelona looked in for a difficult afternoon thanks to a first half strike from Sergio Garcia, Lionel Messi sparked into action to steer his time to a brilliant 5-1 win. The diminutive Argentine scored a goal either side half-time before Pique headed Luis Enrique's side into a commanding 3-1 win.

Substitute Pedro then got in on the act with a well-timed finished before Messi completed yet another La Liga hat-trick.   

90mins: We're into stoppage time now at the Nou Camp where Messi has been at his sensational best. The home side, still in search of the sixth goal, will move two points behind Real Madrid.

86mins: Iniesta looks to play in Alves, but the Brazilian is offside as the ball runs out of play. The Barca players have certainly enjoyed this second half. 

Anything Cristiano can do, I can do better, says Messi as he bags a La Liga hat-trick of his own. 

Pedro, clear down the right, slides the ball across to Messi who strokes the ball home with the inside of his right boot. Looks like he really enjoyed that one. 

And it's four. Pedro gets in on the act to give the Catalan giants a 4-1 lead. Alba plays a long ball right onto Pedro's right boot, the Spaniard controls and lashes home to compound Espanyol's misery. 

74mins: Messi has almost won the game on his own at the Nou Camp but still he tracks back, wins the ball and earns a huge cheer from the home fans.

 

Pete Jenson: Suarez wont be happy about being taken off. Great chance to break the duck against a fading Espanyol side. Luis Enrique clearly not taking that into consideration.

70mins: Espanyol change as Caicedo makes way for Stuani. 

69mins: Suarez is given a rest as Pedro enters the action. Messi sends the free-kick just over the bar. 

68mins: Messi is scythed down by Alvaro, who rightfully receives a yellow card and gives Barca a free-kick from 20-yards out.  Can Messi bag his hat-trick? 

64mins: Rakitic, who has impressed this evening, is replace by Andres Iniesta. Not a bad substitution...

62mins: Xavi looks for Alves with a delicate diagonal ball into the box but Casilla rushes out to stop the move in its tracks.

59mins: Change for Espanyol as Hector Moreno replaces Canas. 

59mins: Barca have the ball in the back of the net again but Messi is flagged offside before giving the ball to Neymar to tap home. 

It's game over already! In eight second half minutes Barca have taken the game away from Espanyol as Pique heads the Catalan giants into a 3-1 lead. 

The attacking trio of Barca do indeed prove to strong for Espanyol. Neymar beats his man out on the left before feeding Suarez who sends a brilliant curling cross back to Messi.

The Argentine nutmegs one defender with his left foot before curling the ball home with his right. Genius. 

48mins: Neymar is barged off the ball by Eric inside the penalty area, but the referee waves play on. The Brazilian was almost through but just wasn't strong enough. 

We're back underway at the Nou Camp. Can Espanyol build on a strong first half or will Barca show their quality? Find out here...

Pete Jenson: Messi's magic covering a multitude of sins. Barca slow, sideways, static and being held by mid-table Espanyol.

Who else but Lionel Messi? Just when it looked as though Espanyol would take a deserved lead into the break, Messi picks up the ball outside the box, fakes to shoot before curling a delightful shot low past Casilla and into the net. 

40mins: Espanyol come so close to doubling their lead following another bright counter-attack. Víctor Sanchez is played through by Garcia and finds himself one on one with Bravo, but a loose touch hands the advantage to the keeper who saves well. 

36mins: The Catalan giants come close again. This time Suarez tries his luck from 18-yards out. However, the former Liverpool man snatches at his effort and the left-footed striker trickles past Casilla's left post. 

33mins: Barca smell blood here. Messi looks like he's had enough of watching the game pass him by and jinks through tackles of two Espanyol defenders before just being crowded out inside the penalty area. 

30mins: So close from Messi! He hits the crossbar with the free-kick he'd won just moments earlier.  Casilla was beaten all ends up. 

29mins: Caicedo, who has been Espanyol's best player, wins the ball in his own half before bombing forward and feeding Garcia. Unfortunately for the travelling fans, Garcia's shot was tame and Bravo saved easily.

At the other end, Messi is fouled on the edge of the area in a very dangerous position. The Argentine stands over the ball... 

24mins: It's all a bit too predictable from Barca. Messi, out on the right, has done very little while Suarez is struggling to get into the game.

Rakitic looks lively, but has just lost the ball on the edge of Espanyol's box after a loose touch. 

18mins: Barca look to hit back through Messi, but the Argentine overhits his diagonal pass to Alba and out of play for an Espanyol corner. 

Pete Jenson: Busquets continues to be a shadow of the player he was under Pep Guardiola.

And it's Espanyol with the opening goal! Sergio Garcia, who has started brightly capitalised on a mistake by Busquets before driving into the Barca box and finishing with his left foot. Pique backed off and backed off, allowing Garcia time and space for a shot. 

7mins: The visitors enjoy their best moment of the game as good work down the left sees Sergio Garcia race to the byline before cutting the ball back across Barca's six yard box. 

Pique managers to clear with Caicedo lurking. 

5mins: Rakitic swings in a deep cross from the right which looked to be gliding towards the head of Suarez at the far post. Alvaro is there to clear. 

The away side have started with two banks of four and have been leaving two men up, but are yet to see much of the ball. 

2mins: Espanyol start brightly as Caicedo attacks down the left before Alba clear for Neymar to go off on his first sprint of the afternoon.

The Brazilian beats two before passing to an offside Suarez. 

And we're underway at the Nou Camp as Espanyol start with the ball. 

So, Sergio Busquets will make his 300th Barce appearance this afternoon. His record so far isn't too shabby...

Record so far in 299 games: 216W, 54D, 29L

Pete Jenson: Ahead of their warm-up Barcelona players pose for team photo with 'get well soon Thomas' messages on their shirts for the injured Vermaelen who was operated on last week.

It's Pique and Mascherano in the centre of defence for Barcelona this afternoon.

Cristiano Ronaldo scores his 23rd La Liga hat-trick to hand Carlo Ancelotti's side three points.
