A woman has been taken into psychiatric care after allegedly stalking former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Ceceilia Berkowitz, 35, a failed 2013 NYC mayoral candidate, was carted off by security after she was spotted ‘acting irrationally’ at Mr Bloomberg’s offices.

Ms Berkowitz, who had repeatedly tweeted her excitement about seeing her ‘close friend’ Bloomberg, was placed under psychiatric observation at Bellevue Hospital, police have said.

Big fan: Ms Berkowitz proudly tweeted this unnerving image of her photographing Michael Bloomberg without his knowledge

Ms Berkowitz has allegedly had a history of stalking the former mayor, making several attempts to get hold of his personal phone number and even proudly posting a strange photograph showing her taking a picture of Mr Bloomberg.

The former college professor was removed from Mr Bloomberg’s offices by police on Wednesday after attempting to make contact with the former mayor, New York Daily News reports.

The tweets were all variations of the same message: ‘Great plans tomorrow to see Mike Bloomberg at Bloomberg LP - can't wait to see my close friend since around the time of Hurricane Irene!’

In her Twitter bio, Ms Berkowitz describes herself as: ‘President, Committee & recent NYC Mayoral Candidate Professor Finance/Math (Wharton '00, Rutgers MBA '08). Friends with Mayor Bloomberg.’

These three tweets, posted minutes apart, alerted security at Bloomberg's offices ahead of her visit

Her display photo on the microblogging network is one of her with then-mayor Michael Bloomberg from 2012.

She has used Twitter to make a number of attempts to contact Mr Bloomberg in the recent months, including asking several people to give out his details.

Earlier this month she posted: ‘Hi to my friend @mikebloomberg Do you want to join me and @galeabrewer for breakfast?’

In March she tweeted former Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who also appears in her Twitter picture: ‘Hi. I was wondering if you might have Mike Bloomberg's cell #? Also, it might be good to meet w u in NJ or NYC. Any plans2B?’

Ms Berkowitz, a former adjunct professor at Hunter College, City University of New York, has also made several attempts to get in touch with Mr Bloomberg via Bloomberg TV anchor Betty Liu and Bloomberg CEO Dan Doctoroff.

On April 7 she wrote: '@bettyintheloop @Bloomberg .@bloombergtv #pennalumni Hi Betty. Just retweeted some of your good tweets & I hope to catch you by cell soon!'

Determined: Ms Berkowitz, pictured with a man believed to be her partner, made several attempts to contact Michael Bloomberg via twitter and by asking staff at Blooomberg TV for his phone number

Inspiration: Ms Berkowitz ran for mayor of New York City in 2013, telling journalists that she was inspired to run for the post by Michael Bloomberg

On April 14 she posted: '.@BettyInTheLoop Hey Betty - I tried your cell today and want to so my best to catch you tomorrow or if not this week!'

As well as: '@DanDoctoroff Hi Dan. I was wondering if you can ask @MikeBloomberg to call me this week? My best number 917-923-5760'

Last year, she unsuccessfully ran for mayor of New York City, saying that her ‘friend’ Mr Bloomberg has inspired her to candidate for the post.

In an interview with Capital New York, she said becoming mayor would be a good opportunity for her because she had good experience in starting new jobs and was prepared to spend her own money on 'getting ready'.

She told journalist Azi Paybarah, who interviewed her after she contacted him on Twitter to announce that she was running for mayor, that she lost a lot of money working in higher education 'because I had to get to work on time and the students needed me to always show up'.

‘Even if I lose money myself - Mayor Bloomberg himself doesn't take a salary - I would be prepared to spend the money on getting ready, like, if I have an emergency and need to buy new shoes.’

Ms Berkowitz is reportedly still under observation at Bellevue Hospital, and no charges has been made against her.
