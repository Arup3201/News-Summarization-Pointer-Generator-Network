Revenue chiefs have been criticised by MPs after their 'disgraceful' tax helpline left millions out of pocket.

Taxpayers had to fork out £136 million last year on premium-priced phone lines waiting to speak to HM Revenue & Customs. A quarter of their 79 million calls went unanswered.

Now the Commons Public Accounts Committee has warned the situation could get even worse, thanks to plans to shut hundreds of tax inquiry centres.

Premium-priced: Taxpayers forked out £136 million on phone lines waiting to speak to HMRC last year

HMRC has promised improvements 
but MPs condemned its 'woefully inadequate and unambitious' new target to
answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes.

The committee said there was a 'real risk' 
of things actually getting worse with new tax and benefit systems - such
as Iain Duncan Smith's Universal Credit welfare system - likely to add 
to the volume of calls while staff numbers were being cut.

HMRC opened a consultation yesterday on 
closing all 281 of its face-to-face tax inquiry centres in favour of a 
targeted 'mobile' system in homes, businesses or community locations.

'Real risk': MP Margaret Hodge believes closing all 281 HMRC face-to-face inquiry centres will add more pressure on its phone lines

It claims the move will save 
customers almost £12million a year in lost time and travel costs and 
slash running costs by more than £13million a year.

But MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons committee, believes the move would 'undoubtedly put more pressure on phone lines'.

'HMRC considers that it will be able to 
improve service standards by reducing avoidable contact with customers 
and using its staff more flexibly,' she said.

'It may need to put in additional resources, though, to avoid the kind of plummeting performance we have seen in the past.

'Just how the department is going to 
improve standards of customer service, given the prospect of its having 
fewer staff and receiving a higher volume of calls, is open to question.

'HMRC plans to cut the number of 
customer-facing staff by a third by 2015. At the same time, the stresses
associated with introducing the Real Time Information System, Universal
Credit and changes to child benefit are likely to drive up the number 
of phone calls to the department.'

Mrs Hodge said it was 'disgraceful' that
taxpayers who had no choice about dealing with HMRC were subjected to 
unacceptable levels of service when they phoned or wrote.

And she criticised the department's 
'abysmal record' in not answering 20million calls in 2011/12 and only 
responding to 66 per cent of letters within 15 days.

'We are pleased to see signs that 
HMRC is changing its attitude,' she said. 'Officials are beginning to 
realise that good customer service lies at the heart of any strategy to 
maximise revenues while cutting costs.

Cost cutting: HMRC said closing its centres will save customers £12m a year in lost time and travel costs

'However, HMRC's new target of answering 80 per cent of calls within five minutes is woefully inadequate and unambitious.'

The new target would still leave 16 million people waiting more than five minutes, the committee's report pointed out.

'If there are significant increases 
in customer contact, HMRC may need to put in additional resources to 
avoid its performance plummeting, as it has in the past, let alone 
improving as it should,' it concluded.

HMRC's problems have happened despite spending £900million on customer service.

Defence: HMRC said it has been answering more than 90 per cent of calls to its contact centres

The Commons public accounts committee welcomed planned improvements, including a call-back system and a move away from expensive 0845 numbers.

A spokesman for the HMRC said: 'This report criticises a previous poor standard of service from which HMRC has already recovered.

'In the past three months, HMRC has been answering more than 90 per cent of calls to our contact centres and during the current year we have replied to 84.5 per cent of the 16 million pieces of post we have received within 15 working days.

'To make it cheaper for customers to call us, we already transferred our Tax Credits phone lines from 0845 to 0345 numbers, and will begin to move our remaining lines to 03 numbers from April.'
