Steven Gerrard duly arrived, centre stage, on 75 minutes. The script had been prepared, with the match programme celebrating the fact that it was 16 years since the Liverpool captain, then a callow Scouse youth, came off the bench to take the field at Anfield for the first time.

But the life of a footballer, like the seven ages of man, is cyclical. So at the age of 34, Gerrard found himself back on the bench, four games in 10 days deemed a schedule too far for the Liverpool captain nowadays.

In fact his manager, Brendan Rodgers, hadn’t even realised the significance of the day until he saw the souvenir match programme. ‘I felt a bit bad then,’ he said of his decision to rest Gerrard.

Player ratings from Rob Draper at Anfield 

But with the game locked at 0-0, with both sides sensing a victory, it seemed natural that the captain should take the field to finish the job.

Of course, football doesn’t always work out quite so simply and the best scriptwriters love a good twist. Anfield had the finale it desired but it was Glen Johnson who provided the heroics on 85 minutes. There was a lovely cross from Jordan Henderson, met quite magnificently by Rickie Lambert, whose header crashed against the bar.

As the rebound dropped, it was clear there was a race on between Johnson’s head, the boot of Erik Pieters and the onrushing presence of Asmir Begovic. You could not have blamed Johnson for flinching but he ensured his head was there first, shortly after followed by Pieters’s boot. And the fact that Gerrard was a mere bystander for the goal barely diminished from the drama.

It was Johnson’s last contribution to the game — the cut to his head meant that treatment was required — but it was mightily significant for this game. Whether the same can be said for Liverpool’s season remains a moot point. This was undoubtedly a desperately needed victory for Liverpool, the last in the Premier League having come at QPR more than a month ago.

If Wednesday night’s draw against Ludogorets was the turning point of which Rodgers spoke, this at least was another step in the right direction. However, there is still an awful lot of hard work to be done before Liverpool are truly in the ascendant again.

The fact that of the £120million spent on talent last summer, only Rickie Lambert could make the starting line-up, is an indication of the deeper malaise at the club at present.

‘We need players at this time who have quality and experience,’ Rodgers explained. ‘The guys who came in (in the summer), the younger players will get their chance. Right now we need confidence and experience in the team.’

But there was precious little to commend in the first-half performance. Liverpool conceded possession cheaply, failed to read each other’s movements and created almost nothing.

On 27 minutes, Lambert lifted a free-kick high into the Anfield Road stand; it was noteworthy only in that it was the first attempt either side had contrived. Stoke had been little better but at least as the visitors, there was less onus on them to attack.

Rodgers’s principal problem is that Liverpool of course are now judged by much higher standards due to the excitement they generated last season and those opening 45 minutes felt a world away from those heady days. Thankfully, the second half improved considerably, with Bojan Krkic and Raheem Sterling both demonstrating the vitality of youth and technique. Bojan, in particular, was a hub of creativity for Stoke.

He fed Mame Biram Diouf with a delightful ball on 58 minutes which Simon Mignolet did well to smother; he hit the post on the hour, having skipped past Lucas; and right at the death he executed a volley from outside the box of which Marco van Basten would be proud and which Mignolet did superbly to tip over.

‘He was the outstanding player,’ said his manager Mark Hughes of the former Barcelona child star. ‘Everyone can see the quality he has. He is getting stronger in every game. He is enjoying the Premier League, enjoying playing for us. We need to give him the ball more often because he has the ability to produce

Sterling was attempting to do something similar for Liverpool, wriggling his way through a forest of defenders on 61 minutes but pulling his shot just wide. He then fed Lucas on 65 minutes, giving the Brazilian a clear sight of goal, which he wasted by shooting straight at Begovic. 

Johnson then pressed forward and fed Lambert, who again shot at Begovic. But the best chance of all came when Sterling squeezed the ball back to Joe Allen, who, eight yards from goal, lifted the ball high and over and into the Kop on 69 minutes.

At least there was attacking intent and creative combinations around the box. Liverpool were looking a little bit more like their old selves. True, Sterling had to save his team, chesting a Diouf shot off the line on 82 minutes with the score still 0-0. But ultimately it would be a day which Rodgers could enjoy, skipping down the touchline in celebration when the goal did come. ‘I think with the way I like to play football people think I want to win 5-3 and 6-4,’ said Rodgers. ‘But I am equally happy to win 1-0.’ For now that is enough for Liverpool.
