It is often joked that  women drivers are less competent than men, which is, of course, wildly incorrect.

But one unnamed woman  set the fairer sex back a bit with driving that has been branded the 'worst in the world.'

In a hilarious video shot in a parking lot in the Bay Area in California, a woman  manages to turn what should have been a quick maneuver into a four minute ordeal.

Difficult: The woman in the white BMW (center) drives into the parking bay at a dodgy angle and can't park

Help: She waves over a man to help her and he climbs into the driver's seat and parks it in just 40 seconds 

 

The clip shows the  woman  drive into the spot at a bad angle after she went the wrong way down a parking lot.

Once in front of the parking space, the woman, who is fittingly dressed in bright pink, constantly turns the wheel the wrong way.

And after struggling for close to four minutes  she waves over a young man to help her out.

She gets out and the man  can be seen  climbing into the driver's seat to offer his help. He then manages to pull into the space in a record 40 seconds, and all is well.

Shopping: After she finishes shopping, the woman attempts to pull out of the spot, and,  has a horrible time

Bad driver: She can be seen scraping the side of a white truck as she takes another three minutes to reverse

After she finishes shopping, the  woman attempts to pull out of the spot, and, once again, has a horrible time. She even manages to scrape the side of the white truck which is parked next to her.

Yet, showing sheer tenacity, the woman driver continues to turn the wheel the wrong way and after another three minutes of trying she finally manages to reverse out of the spot and drive away.
