After weeks of chilly weather, Britain will finally start to feel some warmth this week.

Forecasters say that England and Wales will see bright and sunny weather with temperatures up into the teens by Tuesday.

Scotland - which is the warmest area of the UK today - will stay largely the same and hover around 9C.

Met Office forecaster Rebecca Sherwin said most of the country will see warmer temperatures, clear skies and lighter winds with most areas hitting 12 to 13C at least.

With the brighter skies spreading by Tuesday, the outlook is looking a lot more springlike, she said.

'It will clearly feel like a change because there has been quite a chill for a few weeks now,' she said.

The warmest place in the UK today is expected to be Aberdeenshire with around 9C, which will be the minimum temperature for most of the UK by Tuesday.

And, the forecaster said the warm weather is set to continue: 'There's no sign of an imminent return to chilly conditions.'

A dry and fine day is expected for much 
of the UK on Monday with overnight cloud breaking to give spells of 
sunshine.

However, it will be cloudier across the Western Isles, the 
western fringes of Scotland and Northern Ireland with a few spots of 
drizzle possible.
