Terrifying: The 56-year-old man slipped on to the tracks after becoming disorientated following a seizure at a railway station in Australia

The terrifying drama unfolded at Wooloowin station in Brisbane minutes before a train was due to arrive.

CCTV footage released by Queensland rail shows the man  wearing a suit and tie, standing on the platform, but moving in an erratic fashion.

He moves to the edge of the platform and takes a huge step forward into mid-air before falling on to the tracks. 

Springing into action: As one by-stander runs to get help, Ms Symour is seen putting down her bag and running over to the edge of the platform, calling out to the confused passenger

Help: The man, whose identity has not been revealed, is then seen kneeling forward, appearing too confused to move so Ms Seymour climbs down

The man, whose identity has not been revealed, is then seen kneeling forward, appearing too confused to move to safety.

As one by-stander runs to get help, Ms Seymour, who six months into her nursing training at Southbank Institute of Technology, is seen putting down her bag and running over to the edge of the platform.

'I tried to get a verbal response from him at first, but when that didn’t work I said to another lady "I’m going to have to get on the tracks’", ' Ms Seymour told the Australian Times.

After jumping down she then guides him over to the edge of the tracks and pushes him up to the platform with the help of another woman.

Rescue: She guides him over to the edge of the tracks and pushes him up to the platform with the help of another woman

Relief: She is then seen explaining to the man what had happened as they wait for emergency services on the platform

Ms Seymour told the newspaper that she had recently covered situations where people lose orientation on her training course.

'I kept asking him questions while getting him to lift both hands, and taking his pulse. His heart rate was up,' Ms Seymour said.

'It’s a matter of just constantly checking that cognitive response. I was surprised how the training just kicked in.'

Jim Benstead, acting chief executive officer of Queensland Rail, said that if a train had been coming at the exact moment the man fell, 'it could have been disastrous'.

'It could have gone very differently today,' he told local newspaper the Brisbane Times.
