In the towering shadow of Pakistan’s Black Mountain, Irfan Naseer and Irfan Khalid were trained to assemble the deadly IEDs that are the scourge of British soldiers.

The home-grown terrorists learned the tradecraft of mass murder that they wanted to bring to the shopping centres, cinemas and train stations of Britain.

The pair had originally flown to Karachi but made their way to the training camp after meeting other fundamentalists in the madrasas of the city.

Inside one of the anonymous white washed houses and compounds that dot the hillside, they were taught to mix chemicals and ingredients from ordinary household items.

Plot: Irfan Khalid and Irfan Naseer arrive at Birmingham airport before heading to Pakistan for terrorist training

Training camps: Khalid and Naseer (pictured with the trolley) were caught on CCTV going back and forth to Pakistan from Birmingham Airport to receive instruction on plotting their attack on Britain

From nail polish remover, bleach and fertiliser, they made crude bombs.

Then, in the vast open spaces of the 
tribal lands 140 miles north of Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, they were 
shown by Al Qaeda-linked bomb-makers how to detonate the devices, fire 
Kalishnikovs and use poisons, as well as being made to undergo 
exhaustive physical exercise.

Once back in the UK they tried to 
create a new kind of improvised explosive device from the ingredients of
 cold packs used to ease swelling on bruised or injured joints.

But they didn’t release that the ingredients had been changed because of fears they may be misused.

Collecting for terror: Irfan Naseer left and Irfan Khalid holding bucket undertake bogus charity collections in Birmingham to secretly raise funds for their bombing campaign

Watched: The group were under surveillance 24 hours a day by MI5 and the police, pictured here returning from a trip to a camp in Pakistan

bomb devices such as this alarm clock (right)

Instead of ammonium nitrate, which 
can be transformed into a potent explosive, the packs were filled with 
relatively harmless urea, a key constituent of urine.

The gang had hoped to carry the 
devices in rucksacks or hide them in bags and detonate them using 
suicide bombers or remote timers.

When police raided the bomb factory, 
they discovered a sample sports pack had been carefully taken apart and 
the contents laid on a tray.

In a bin was a partially burned 
handwritten note which, when analysed, contained identical formulas for 
bombs used against British troops in Afghanistan.

Discussing the plot, Naseer said: 
‘Seven or eight of them in different places with timers on... all for 
the same time probably to go boom, boom, boom everywhere.’

He estimated that a 1kg device, 
easily carried in a bag, would kill 25 and injure up to 70 people, 
especially if wrapped with metal bolts to create deadly shrapnel.

But it was in Pakistan – some 3,800 
miles from their Birmingham homes and their intended targets – that the 
Britons were turned into trained killers.

The rugged Black Mountain or the Kala
 Dhaka region of Pakistan’s North West Frontier province was one of 
three principal areas they visited to meet fellow radicals and receive 
training during two lengthy visits to the country.

On the first of their extended visits
 in March 2009, Naseer and Khalid received at least eight days intensive
 training and additional radicalisation and religious instruction. That 
rose to 40 on the second visit between December 2010 and July 2011.

In Karachi, the Britons studied at 
madrasas attached to two mosques with other radicalised young men, 
including several foreigners. Both mosques, which are said to receive 
large donations and funding from wealthy supporters in the UK, have 
links to Jaish e Mohammad or Army of Mohammad, a jihadi group branded a 
terrorist organisation by the UK and US.

It was formed to wage a proxy 
war against India over the disputed territory of Kashmir.

The group have successfully 
cultivated important relationships with other prominent jihadi 
organisations including Al Qaeda, the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which
 was said to have trained the terrorists who carried out the 2008 attack
 on Mumbai hotels.

Probe: Police raided properties all over Birmingham, including this safe house, which was full of bomb-making equipment and documents detailing how to make them

Safe house: The trio were based at this property in White Street, Birmingham, and used as the headquarters for their terror cell

Explosive: Police uncovered a variety of powders and liquids, including this 'cold pack' in the dingy house

Destroying the evidence: Police found this burnt note that detailed the bomb-making process

Bomb-making equipment: Police discovered a 
variety of ordinary domestic equipment including granules to keep 
material cold (left) and a pharmaceutical syringe (right)

Officials in Pakistan say their bomb 
makers were among those believed to have tutored Naseer and Khalid in 
making explosives  while they studied the Koran with their clerics.

Tens of thousands of young British men visit Pakistan each year genuinely to study or stay with relatives.

Naseer and Khalid told police they 
visited family in the Punjab, close to the Kashmir area, where 
investigators believe they met trainers – underlining the huge problems 
facing anti-terror investigators in the UK.

Fundraising: Irfan Naseer,  Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali held table top sales in Birmingham where the cash raised would be secretly siphoned off to pay for trips to Pakistan

Surveillance: MI5 had been watching the terror group and had planted a bug in their Hinda Civic where they were heard boasting about the atrocity they planned

Shopping: Ashik Ali was watched buying curtains from Argos as part the sophisticated spying operation by the British secret services

But by the time of their second visit
 Naseer and Khalid were ‘on the radar’ of MI5 and Pakistan’s Inter 
Services Intelligence agency.

They went to the Waziristan area 
skirting Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan, where Taliban and Al Qaeda 
trainers are active. They also went to the hills above the Tattapani 
region of disputed Kashmir, for years a hub of Jaish e Mohammad’s 
activities.

It was while in Waziristan that the 
Britons faced what investigators called ‘a wake-up call to the reality 
of the region’ which has become the focus of controversial drone attacks
 by the US.

For four hours Nasser and Khalid cowered beneath the camouflage of trees while a drone had circled overhead.

Late night: Officers pulled the terrorists over as they drove to a takeaway just before midnight

Prosecution: Ashik Ali was taken from the car and is detained along with the two other men who were all found guilty of terrorism offences at Woolwich Crown Court today

Capture: West Midlands Police arrested the three men in Birmingham after intercepting them in their VW as they drove through the city in September 2011

Naseer was secretly recorded by MI5 
recalling: ‘If I have to stay here for another hour, I will pray that I 
get hit by a drone.’

Partially because of the success of 
the drones, fixed training camps no longer exist in areas like 
Warizistan or Kala Dhaka. Instead, they are set-up in rural and isolated
 spots to be used only once.

Religious instruction and physical 
training are always included and like other convicted British jihadists,
 the two Britons underwent exhausting fitness training – running 
repeatedly up hills.

The month after their return four 
fellow would-be British suicide bombers from the cell they hoped to 
create travelled to Pakistan for terrorist training.

They were Naweed Ali, 24, Ishaaq Hussain, 20, Khobaib Hussain, 20, and Shahid Khan, 20.

Three of the young men came back to 
Britain within days after the family of one of them discovered where 
they had gone and arranged for their return. The fourth apparently 
stayed on in Pakistan with family until October.
