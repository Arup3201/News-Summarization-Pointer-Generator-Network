A mother bit off the end of a sex attacker’s tongue as he subjected her to a terrifying assault so that he could be brought to justice.

Adele Barber, 29, was grabbed by the man as she walked along a deserted alleyway near her home.

When he groped her and tried to kiss her, she bravely fought back and sank her teeth into his tongue.

Although it didn’t stop him – he even seemed to take a perverse enjoyment from the pain – it provided vital DNA for police to analyse when she managed to escape.

Two months later they arrested Ferdinand Manila, 28. It emerged that he had attacked a 55-year-old woman minutes after his assault on Mrs Barber.

He has now been given an indefinite hospital order after being found guilty of three counts of sexual assault. A court ruled he didn’t have the mental capacity to enter a plea.

Mrs Barber – who lost a rape case against another man ten years earlier – told ITV’s This Morning yesterday: ‘After the first assault I was a mess. I was really young and naïve and didn’t go to police straight away so they didn’t have enough evidence.

‘That made me more determined this time. I thought “I’ve got to get evidence and show this is not consensual. No one is going to do this to me again. I’m going to make sure this person gets the treatment they need”.’

The mother-of-three waived her right to anonymity yesterday to urge other sex assault victims to do all they can to help convict their attacker.

‘Your body can freeze but, if you can, fight back and get evidence,’ she said. Mrs Barber was attacked in daylight as she walked home from a doctor’s appointment in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, in January last year.

Manila brushed past her in the alleyway and moments later ran back towards her, pushing her up against a wall where he assaulted her.

Despite the danger she faced, she had the presence of mind to realise he was ‘vulnerable’ as soon as he forced his tongue inside her mouth.

‘I wanted to get DNA and cause pain to get him off me. I didn’t think I would bite off his tongue, I thought I would just get his DNA on my teeth,’ she said. 

'When I bit him and caused him pain, he enjoyed it. I knew then that something wasn’t quite right but I was relentless and got him off me.’

She ran a mile home with the piece of flesh in her mouth and immediately rang the police before explaining to her husband Paul, a laboratory technician, what had happened.

Officers advised her to place it in a sterile pot and were able to match it to Manila when he was caught in March.

He was convicted of two offences against Mrs Barber and another against the other victim when he appeared at Luton Crown Court on January 21.

The court heard he had been held in a psychiatric hospital where staff reported he made sexual comments to female employees and fantasised about peeling the skin off people. Judge Barbara Mensah commended Mrs Barber’s bravery, saying: ‘His first victim took a big risk when she bit off part of Mr Manila’s tongue. This was very distressing for her.’

Mrs Barber had a conditional place on a university course to study midwifery but lost it after taking time off to deal with the trauma of her ordeal. She has also been left anxious to leave home.

Despite the terrible impact on her life, she has expressed her hope her attacker would get well. ‘Hopefully he can get the treatment he needs and then get out and start his life again,’ she added.

Around 85,000 women are raped and 400,000 sexually assaulted every year in England and Wales, according to official figures. More than a quarter fail to report the attack.
