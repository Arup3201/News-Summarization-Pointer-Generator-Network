Jupiter’s ‘Great Red Spot’ has been turned white in a stunning new infrared image of our solar system’s largest storm.

The Jovian storm is believed to have a lifetime of 300 to 400 years and has winds screaming at hundreds of miles per hour.

It usually appears as a deep red oval surrounded by swirling layers of white, yellow, orange, but this latest image casts it in a new light.

Jupiter’s ‘Great Red Spot’ has been turned white in a stunning new infrared image of our solar system’s largest storm. The Jovian storm is believed to have a lifetime of 300 to 400 years

A gigantic storm twice as big as Earth, the spot was first observed 300 years ago.

Like a hurricane on Earth, the center is relatively calm, but farther out, the winds scream at 425mph (680km/h).

The spot, whose main cloud layer is likely ammonia, appears to be an area of upwelling, in which clouds form from below.

The spot is technically an anticyclone - a cyclones whirling in the other direction.

Infrared images such as this can cut through the gas and dust captured in visible light photos 

The image, released by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, also shows Jupiter’s moon, Ganymede in the upper right appearing as three coloured dots. 

The effect is due to the fact Ganymede moved during the time required to take the three separate colour images.

The image was taken by a camera mounted on the Subaru Telescope, a 27ft (8.2 metre) instrument located atop Mauna Kea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island.

The Great Red Spot seen in this image has baffled astronomers for years, and the cause of its has remained a mystery.

One theory put forward in November is that the red spot is in fact, sunburn.

Nasa said it believes the spot is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet's upper atmosphere. 

The results contradict the other leading theory for the origin of the spot's striking colour - that the reddish chemicals come from beneath Jupiter's clouds. 

The image follows another stunning shot of the gas giant revealed last week by Nasa.

Hubble captured the rare sight of three of Jupiter's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet's banded face.

The telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — Europa, Callisto and Io — in action 601 million miles (968 million km) from Earth. 

The Jovian lunar gathering, which happens only once or twice a decade, was captured on January 23 showing the unusual sight in a single frame.

Jupiter is composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, with just a sprinkling of other elements.

Scientists are interested in understanding what combinations of elements are responsible for the hues seen in Jupiter's clouds, as this would provide insights into the giant planet's make-up.
