A British businesswoman facing three years in a Dubai jail could not have had sex in the back of a taxi because she was on her period, her lawyer told a court today.

Rebecca Blake, a £100,000-a-year recruitment consultant, is accused of stripping naked in the back of a Dubai cab and writhing on top of Irishman Conor McRedmond.

Her lawyer Shaker Al Shammary told Dubai Misdemeanours Court the taxi driver made a malicious false accusation after rowing with Mr McRedmond over the fare. Mr Al Shammary also claimed the driver's account was inconsistent.

The pair were also charged with consuming alcohol after admitting to a 10-hour drinking binge on the day of their arrest.

Mr Al Shammary told the court: 'This is Dubai, not a mosque. Everyone drinks.'

Ms Blake, 29, of Dorking, Surrey, and welder Mr McRedmond, 28, from Tullamore, County Offaly, were arrested on May 4 after meeting for the first time earlier that day in a hotel bar.

Pakistani taxi driver Qaiser Khan, 29, said he picked the couple up at around 11pm after their all-day drinking binge, which had started with midday brunch and unlimited drinks.

During the journey Mr Khan said he looked in his rear view mirror and noticed Ms Blake had taken her top off. She was straddling Mr McRedmond and was 'moaning for two minutes and making the sounds of a woman having sex', according to police records.

He pulled over on Sheikh Zayed road when he spotted a police patrol car. He then asked Emirati policeman Abdullah Obaid Khamis, 22, to, 'Come and see what they are doing.'

The officer said he found the pair having sex in the car and interrupted them by tapping on the window, the court heard.

Move: Ms Blake moved to Dubai last September and worked for Manpower recruitment firm until she was sacked
 after the incident in May

Lawyer, Mr Al Shammary asked for the sex and indecency charges to be dropped saying: 'The driver's testimony to police officers contradicts his testimony to prosecutors. My clients' testimonies have remained the same during police and prosecution investigations.'

He added the couple both denied having naked sex and were backed by police forensic reports, which came back negative when they were tested for evidence of intercourse.

Ms Blake, who moved to Dubai in September last year and worked for Manpower recruitment firm until she was sacked after the incident in May, has said: 'I'm no saint. The whole incident was a blur.'

She began drinking at a £35-a-head hotel brunch with free-flowing wine, then indulged in a happy hour at the bar before moving to the Irish Village pub with Mr McRedmond. The pair left the bar at 10.30pm.

Mr Al Shammary said: 'They took a taxi outside a hotel and (Mr McRedmond) had an argument with the taxi driver about the fare because he saw the driver had taken him the long way round. He told him he would report him to the police.

'My clients live here and they know Dubai so they knew the quickest route. The taxi driver saw he was drunk and thought he should go to the police before he had a chance to complain. As soon as he saw a police car he pulled over and said they were having sex.

'When the officer came over, they had their clothes on and were not doing anything. The witness statements do not tally.

He added: 'There was no proof they had sex and (Ms Blake) had her period so they could not have done. They are adults who know what they are doing so they could have had sex in a hotel if they had wanted to. Why bother in a taxi?'

Outrage: The couple's lawyer Shaker Al Shammary told Dubai Misdemeanours Court the taxi driver made a malicious false accusation after rowing with Mr McRedmond over the fare

In a statement to police, Mr Khan said the couple asked him to take them to Al Barsha area, then kept changing their minds.

'They kept asking me to go left and right and finally asked me to go to the marina. I noticed the man was drinking and told him it was not allowed to have alcohol inside the taxi but he drank it and threw the bottle out of the window,' Mr Khan told police.

'The next thing, I looked in the mirror and saw the woman sitting on the man's thighs. She was naked, moving up and down and making sounds.'

Mr Khan said when the policeman arrived on the scene Blake had offered him 'a lot of money' to say they were kissing rather than having sex.

'I refused and told the truth during the investigation,' he told police.

According to court records, the policeman - who has yet to appear before the judge - said he saw Ms Blake naked and writhing on Mr McRedmond's lap.

'They kept having sex for four minutes and then I knocked on the glass so they stopped and got dressed. The man's shirt was open, his trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any underwear,' he said.

He added Ms Blake cried when she was arrested and said she wanted to go home.

Ms Blake admitted drinking four glasses of vodka and five glasses of white wine but told prosecutors when she was arrested that Mr McRedmond was only hugging her. Mr McRedmond admitted to drinking 'six or seven' vodka drinks.

Both defendants have been released on bail. The sex and indecency charges each carry a jail term of between one month and three years while consumption of alcohol is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to £340.

The case was adjourned until November 22.
