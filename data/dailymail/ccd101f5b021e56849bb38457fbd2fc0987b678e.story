A German newspaper has risked a royal upset by publishing a  photograph of the Duchess of  Cambridge’s bare bottom.

The picture was taken during Kate’s recent tour of Australia when a gust of wind briefly caught her dress – and her flimsy underwear did not offer much protection.

Now tabloid newspaper Bild am Sonntag has published the image beneath a series of tasteless headlines.

Privacy: The Duchess of Cambridge is at the centre of a new privacy row after Bild in Germany published a picture of her bottom, alongside images of reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her sister Khloe

It ran the photograph alongside 
pictures of US reality television star Kim Kardashian and her sister 
Khloe, famed for their shapely bottoms, with the caption: ‘Khloe, Kim 
and Kate – backsides which have moved us these past few days.’

The
 breach of privacy comes less than two years after the Duke and Duchess 
launched legal action against a French magazine that printed topless 
photographs of Kate on holiday.

The
 latest photograph was taken as the Duchess boarded a helicopter to 
Sydney after an official tour of the Blue Mountains with Prince William
 last month.

The couple had
 been visiting Winmalee, a small community where 195 homes were 
destroyed in the worst bush fires in a decade, as part of a three-week 
tour Down Under.

Incident: Kate's dress was blown upwards by the blades of a helicopter when the Duke and Duchess arrived  in Winmalee in the Blue Mountains

As the wind
 from the helicopter’s rotor blades lifted Kate’s £295 Diane Von 
Furstenberg wrap dress, an opportunistic photographer captured the 
moment and touted it around international newspapers.

It was reportedly sold to the ‘highest bidder’ after British papers refused to print it.

First published in the Bild’s Sunday paper, it also appeared on its website, accompanied by crude captions.

Beside the offending picture were the words: ‘Thank the wind for the insight into the royal household.

‘On Sunday, photos appeared which show our favourite Duchess Kate, 32, in the Australian Blue Mountains.

‘The
 royal helicopter rotor blades swirled up the air so that Kate’s summer 
dress began blowing upwards – affording us a glimpse of her beautiful 
bum.

‘Never have we been so thankful to a helicopter for creating such a wind.’

The
 Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been dragged into a series of 
privacy rows with the foreign press in recent years after photographs 
were published of Kate in a bikini  while she was pregnant, and topless 
while on honeymoon.

In 
February last year, Italian and Australian magazines published 
photographs of Kate with her bump on display while she walked along a 
beach on the secluded Caribbean island of Mustique.

And in September 
2012, the Duke  and Duchess launched  legal action for breach of 
privacy against the publishers of Closer magazine in France after it 
printed topless photographs of Kate.

A
 French photographer took the pictures on a long lens from a road, while
 Kate and William stood on the balcony of a rural chateau in Provence.

Kate
 and William’s lawyer, Aurelien Hamelle, claimed the couple had suffered
 a ‘grotesque breach of privacy’ and felt ‘violated’ during a ‘highly 
intimate moment during a scene of married life’.

It is also not the first time Bild newspaper has risked the wrath of the royals.

In 1994, it ran photographs of the Prince of Wales naked  on a balcony while on holiday near Avignon, in the south  of France.

The
 images of Charles, with just a white dressing-gown draped over his 
shoulder, were taken by a French photographer using a long lens. The 
prince, who was 45 at the time, was described as ‘hunky like a Greek 
statue’ by Bild.

The Duchess
 of Cambridge is no stranger to Marilyn Monroe-style wardrobe 
malfunctions, and had struggled to control the hem of her red dress as 
she stepped off a plane in windy Wellington, New Zealand, while holding 
Prince George at the start of their tour last month.

Her
 navy skirt blew up in the breeze at a charity event in London in 
November, and she nearly revealed too much in a floral dress as she 
arrived at Brisbane airport in 2012.

She
 also narrowly avoided a wardrobe disaster at Calgary airport in 
September 2011 when her Jenny Packham yellow frock was caught by a 
sudden gust of wind.

But despite a string of such incidents, Kate has yet to take a leaf out of the Queen’s book.

Her
 Majesty’s skirts are always fitted at the hem with small lead curtain 
weights, which cost just £1.50 for a pack of four, to prevent the royal 
hemline from flying away in a gust of wind.

A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment on the photograph last night.
