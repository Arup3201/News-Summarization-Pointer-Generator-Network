Xiao Lian from the Gansu region in China was just 17-years-old when she opted for filler

A woman who was told her boss that her face was too thin subjected herself to backstreet cheek-plumping injections that left her severely disfigured.

Xiao Lian from the Gansu region in China was just 17 years old when she opted for filler injections to plump up her face.

While she was happy with the results at first, five years later things started to go wrong. Now, her permanently puffy appearance makes her look much older than her 28 years.

Xiao had 'always hated the thinness of her face', and her boss's comment at the shop where she worked part-time was the final straw.

He said: 'Your face is so thin, you look like a pauper and it is not conducive to the welcoming of riches', according to Guilin Life News.

Xiao then decided to undergo a procedure to plump up her face.

But when she made enquiries at a clinic, the cost quoted was considerable. It wasn't a price that she could afford to pay.

After her initial disappointment, Xiao's friend referred her to a different clinic promising to perform the same procedure for a much more affordable price.

This time, she could afford the cost and, as the doctor seemed legitimate and trained, she decided to go ahead. But the clinic did not have an operating license.

Over the next month a doctor injected a substance into Xiao Lian's face 10 times. Initially, the injections did plump up her cheeks and she was happy with the results.

But years later in 2009 when she was 24, her face began to swell unnaturally. Her eyes, nose and other features started changing shape. By 2013, her face had become very swollen, her eyes had drooped and her hair was falling out.

She went to a doctor and tests revealed she had been injected with 
hydrophilic polyacrylamide gel.

The substance was previously used for breast augmentation, but is now banned in China for cosmetic surgery use after it was found to be toxic.

Xiaolian was extremely traumatised by her drastically altered looks and was driven to contemplate suicide.

She is now undergoing corrective surgery at a cosmetic centre in Guangzhou.

Doctors have warned her that because the substance was inside her body for so long it will be difficult to fix the botched procedure.

'Even for a minor surgery you need to choose a clinic you can trust,' said one of the doctors.

In her case, a gel was used which has since been banned, but in other cases substances have been used which haven't been approved at all.

The rate of botched cosmetic surgery procedures has been rising around the world.

Plastic
 surgeons across Australia have also reported numerous customers seeking
 help to repair injuries from procedures they had done cheaply overseas 
that went wrong.

Hydrophilic polyacrylamide gel (PAAG) was widely used for breat augmentation n China before being banned in 2006.

Hundreds of women were maimed by unsafe implants. The 'magic gel' used in the implants leaked into the body and even caused flesh to rot.

An estimated 300,000 women had the gel inserted in varying forms of cosmetic surgery. The substance is banned in the West. The gel was subject to complaints and court cases as far back as 2002.

Many complications associated with the nonresorbable soft tissue hydrogel filler have been reported in the clinical literature.

These include inflammation, persistent mastodynia, formation of multiple lumps, poor cosmetic results, glandular atrophy, and significant spread of hydrogel into the surrounding tissue.

Data on long-term toxicity is currently unavailable.
