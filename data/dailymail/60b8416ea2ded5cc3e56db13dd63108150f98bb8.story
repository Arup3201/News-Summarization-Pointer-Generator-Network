A One Direction fan who sparked outrage around the world over the last few days when she claimed she killed her pet Chihuahua in a fit of rage because the British boy band did not respond to requests to follow her on Twitter - is a hoax as many had suspected.

The woman sent a desperate tweet to the five singers from her @illumivato account two weeks ago saying: 'Follow me or I'll break my dog's neck'.

The post was accompanied by a picture showing someone pinning a dog to the ground by its throat.

Sick: A montage of images from the Twitter account of a One Direction fan claiming to break her dog's neck after the band did not respond to her plea to follow her

Hoax: While the Twitter user claimed that she had killed the dog in August - this image of the same girl was in circulation in June on the internet

Confession: @illumivato admitted that she was a troll and the claims were not true after being besieged by angry users and before her account was suspended by Twitter

But with millions of tweets being sent to their account everyday, the group very likely did not spot the message and it went ignored.

Several days later, she wrote directly to band member Liam Payne on the social networking site to say: 'I love you. Follow me. My dog has just died.'

She added a picture that she claimed showed her crying as she cradled a dead dog.

But that image has been widely used by internet users to create memes on Spanish speaking sites since June - a full month before @illumivato had claimed to have killed the dog.

It appears to have been part of a trend in Mexico where Facebook users have been posting bizarre pictures on social media to get comments under the hashtag #palface, short for 'pone al Facebook', or put on Facebook.

The image usually has the words 'lol se murio mi perro' written across it, meaning 'lol (laugh out loud) my dog died'. 

Many internet users were appalled to think that someone could really kill the dog - but many will be as equally outraged to think that anyone would find the hoax remotely funny.

Other Images that were reportedly taken from the @illumivato page before it
 was suspended show animals in blenders and a small child tied up.

Each comes with similar messages threatening to kill them if the boy band didn't follow her on Twitter.

Another image that the same user posted of a cat in a blender is easily available on Google images too. 

Retrieved tweets from the account also show similar threats were sent to Lady Gaga and Barack Obama.

Fans of the band, known as 
'Directioners', branded her a 'psycho', with one setting up a petition 
on Change.org demanding she be imprisoned which now has around 3,000 signatures.

The identity of the troll has not been revealed however and it is not even clear whether that person is even a man or a woman.

Mya Fhya, who set up the petition, said: 'This person needs to burn in hell and I want to see justice.'

One Direction has not yet commented on the incident.
