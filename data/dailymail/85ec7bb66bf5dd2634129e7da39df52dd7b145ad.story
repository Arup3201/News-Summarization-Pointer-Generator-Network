David Cameron’s attempt to enshrine his promise of an EU referendum in law is a 'dead parrot', MPs warned tonight.

Labour and Lib Dem peers in the House of Lords united to defeat the Tories in key votes today, plunging the legislation into a parliamentary quagmire.

It means it stands little chance of becoming law before the 2015 election, leaving Eurosceptics to liken it to the dead parrot in the infamous Monty Python sketch in which a pet shop owner repeatedly pretended there was still life in it.

Blow: David Cameron, who used a speech at the World Economic Forum today to attack the EU, wants an in-out referendum by 2017

Mr Cameron today launched a fresh attack on Brussels, claiming 
Eurocrats fear if they do not produce more rules and regulations they 
are ‘not doing their job’.

He said British workers risk becoming 
‘unemployable’ because EU red tape means foreign firms will take their 
business elsewhere.

He
 urged global firms to bring jobs back to Britain, but warned that 
‘complex and overwritten directives’ impose such heavy burdens on 
business that those looking to relocate will opt for countries outside 
the EU.

Mr Cameron promised that if he is Prime Minister after the next election he would claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by 2015.

Tory peer Lord Dobbs said the legislation was suffering 'death by a thousand cuts'

However, he could not bring forward government legislation on the idea because Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems would not back it.

Instead, Tory MP James Wharton took it through the Commons but it has floundered in the Lords.

Today peers voted by 245 votes to 158, majority 87, to amend the wording of the question that would be put to voters in the referendum in 2017.

It means the European Union (Referendum) Bill will have to go back to the Commons for further consideration - eating up more of the little remaining parliamentary time for its consideration.

Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash said: ‘As I understand it from the House of Lords, the European Union Referendum Bill is now, in effect, a dead parrot.’

Lord Hill, Conservative leader in the Lords, added: ‘Labour and the Liberal Democrats have today done yet another U-turn on their position on an In-Out referendum on the European Union.

‘Having accepted this Bill in the House of Commons, they are now trying to kill it in the Lords. Having stayed mum in the Commons, they have now been revealed in their true colours.

‘Although they daren’t admit they do not think the British people should have their say, they are trying to do their dirty work unnoticed in the Lords.

‘Voters will see through this subterfuge and realise that only the Conservatives will give them their say on whether they should remain in the European Union.’

The Bill has already passed its Commons stages. Peers were under pressure to pass it speedily and without amendment to ensure it could proceed before the end of the Parliamentary session.

But peers voted to amend it after more than two and a half hours of impassioned and sometimes angry debate in the Upper House.

Tory Lord Dobbs, who is trying to steer the Bill through the Lords, warned it risked suffering  ‘death by a thousand cuts’.

He said: ‘We know some of the opponents of the Bill are determined to use any means to kill it.

‘We cannot deny the presence of an elephant in the room and a very large and unreasonable elephant - those who have no intention whatsoever of working to improve this Bill but who are solely intent on trying to kill it.

‘If this Bill is to survive and we are to give the people the referendum they want, we have to get this Bill through this House in reasonable shape and very short time.’
