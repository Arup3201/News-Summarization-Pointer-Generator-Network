Clogs are not normally associated with vicious sports, but the innocuous-looking footwear was in fact key part of what was dubbed a martial art of the Victorian era.

Clog-fighting, a mill town pastime, was used as a way of settling disputes - with men squaring up face-to-face to kick the unprotected shins of their opponents with their wooden, metal-soled clogs.

In illegal duels, the loser was whoever gave up or was made to bleed first.

It was officially known across Greater Manchester and Lancashire as 'purring' and common in towns including Rochdale and Wigan.

Clogging fights are believed to have started in the 1700s within mining communities and continued until around 1910.

'It was classed as a sport because, 
although illegal, there were rules and fights would be held at specific 
locations,' said Anna FC Smith, who has curated a new exhibition on clog fighting.

'Gambling also played a part.

'Fights
 were used to settle disagreements but there were also professionals who
 would tour as far as the borders of Yorkshire. People who were 
champions earned good second wages.'

Self-employed artist Ms Smith is behind the exhibition 'Purring - Sport of the People', which will go on show at the Museum Of Wigan Life later this month, and aims to show visitors the history of clog-fighting in all its gory detail.

Miss Smith, from Leigh, has carried out months of research on the sport and 
said the working class contests were often played out with 'a bawdy good
 humour and strong vein of chivalry'.

Included in the exhibition alongside archive records and interviews from spectators are Ms Smith's  ink sketches depicting contests were drawn from eyewitness accounts and records, which reveal reports of naked bouts and serious injuries.

She said: 'There were different variations and often referees. There were probably more misses than hits but often people were badly hurt.

'Children would often be paid to act as look-outs at contests.

The exhibition also features recordings of witnesses being interviewed and objects depicting bouts, including clogs and clog irons.

Lynda Jackson, community history manager at Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust, which manages the museum on behalf of the council, said: 'It's a great opportunity for people to take a step back in time to learn more about a really interesting piece of Wigan's heritage.'
