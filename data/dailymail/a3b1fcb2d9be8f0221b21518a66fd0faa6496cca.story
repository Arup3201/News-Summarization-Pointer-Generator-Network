Refuse collectors have been banned from pulling wheelie bins up alleys because of fears they may suffer a back injury.

In a decision blasted as ‘defying common sense’, hundreds of residents who for decades have been putting their rubbish outside their back doors have been told it is too risky for binmen to collect.

Householders – many of them pensioners – must now pull the wheelie bins along narrow alleyways near their homes themselves or risk not having their rubbish collected. Their only alternative is to attempt to trundle the large bins through the inside of their homes to the front.

'Dangerous': Durham Council officials believe binmen collecting bins from back alleys like this in Newton Aycliffe could give them back injuries

Residents in Newton Aycliffe, County 
Durham, are infuriated by the health and safety clampdown, which 
followed a council risk assessment. 

Letters were sent to 287 households 
to explain that crews could be vulnerable to ‘musculoskeletal injuries’ 
when pulling wheelie bins.

The residents live in terraced houses 
with rear gardens that back on to alleyways about as wide as two wheelie
bins and up to 87 yards long.

They argue that in the days of steel 
bins, crews walked up the alleys to take the dustbins back to the 
dustcart in the street – and that the job has now been made even easier 
by wheelie bins.

However, according to the council, 
crews are being forced to adopt ‘awkward postures’ in the confined 
space, risking back, joint and limb problems.

Tracy Tremewan, 34, who lives in one of eight streets that have been affected, said: ‘I think it’s absolutely shocking.

Neighbours Jean White, left, and Tracy Trermewan are just some of those who are unhappy about the health and safety rules implemented by Durham County Council. Right, a binman in the fifties from a simpler era of refuse collection.

‘That’s what they get paid to do – 
move the bins. They say they can’t move them but we can. But what 
happens if we hurt our backs?’ Neighbour Jean White, 65, who has lived 
in her house for nearly 40 years, said: ‘Before the wheelie bins came in
they used to pick the metal ones up on their shoulders. You’d have 
thought if they were going to hurt their backs they would have done so 
then.

‘The next thing you know we will have to empty the bins into the lorries ourselves.’

It has also been claimed that by 
getting residents to do the work of pushing bins, the council will need 
to employ fewer binmen.

David Stevens, 68, said: ‘The bins are
on wheels and are not heavy for strong binmen. We think that the 
council is nit-picking to save money.’

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said residents had ‘every right to feel short-changed’.

‘Collecting the bins is a basic service which people expect in return for their council tax,’ he added.

‘If binmen have been collecting 
rubbish from the same place for decades, how can the sudden change be 
seriously justified?

'This is another example of health and safety rules 
being interpreted in an extreme way that defies common sense.’

Jimmy Bennett, manager of Streetscene,
which provides the bin collection service, said: ‘By asking residents 
to bring their bins to the end of the lane we can provide a more 
effective service and keep the lane clear.’

The first collection under the new 
rules went ‘smoothly’, he said, adding that special arrangements would 
be made for residents who are unable to move their own bins.
