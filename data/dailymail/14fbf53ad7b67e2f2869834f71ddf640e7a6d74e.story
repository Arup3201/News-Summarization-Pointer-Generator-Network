Roy Hodgson and Brendan Rodgers are set to meet at Loftus Road on Sunday for the first time since the row over Raheem Sterling blew up.

England’s head coach intends to be at Liverpool’s game with QPR and will try to see Rodgers at some point to discuss his comments that followed Sterling telling him he was feeling tired ahead of England’s game in Estonia.

Hodgson had said he intended to speak to Rodgers over Sterling and Daniel Sturridge, who was injured during the international break in September. Sturridge could return to action at QPR.

Rodgers, who said last month he has ‘good communication with Hodgson’, is expected to speak publicly about the Sterling affair for the first time on Thursday at his weekly press conference. 

Sterling was left out of the starting line-up for England's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Estonia  on Sunday, but came off the bench to win the free-kick that led to Wayne Rooney's second-half winner.

Sterling returned to training with Liverpool earlier this week, being driven to Melwood on Tuesday by team-mate Jordan Henderson before driving himself in on Wednesday. 

Rodgers will be hoping the 19-year-old is fit enough to start against QPR on Sunday as Liverpool look to kick start their faltering season. 

Liverpool are currently ninth in the Premier League with 10 points after losing three of their first seven games. 

Sterling has featured in all of Livepool's league games this season - and played 14 games in total for club and country - but has received criticism for his actions.

A spoof Twitter account called '@tiredsterling' has been created mocking the Liverpool star. It has more than 16,000 followers to date.

Former England international Paul Scholes also rubbished the idea that the midfielder needed extended periods of rest after games.

'If you are 19 years old like Raheem Sterling, or even 25 years old like Daniel Sturridge, you do not need a two-day recovery after playing a game, said Scholes in his column for the Independent. 

However, Sterling's former England team-mate Frank Lampard said he was 'brave' to speak out and the criticism has been unfair. 

He told BBC Radio Five Live: 'I think he is actually quite a brave boy to say, "You know what I am not quite at my best here".

'I am actually quite upset, not with the manager as such, but that the aftermath has been a lot of people criticising Raheem Sterling - who is probably in the top two or three players in our country and we need him to be at his best - for making quite a brave decision.

'I think we need to get behind him. Whether it is right or wrong, I don't know, but we are all individuals and he made that call.'
