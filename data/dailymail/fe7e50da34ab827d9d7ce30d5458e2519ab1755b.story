He claims his talents as a racing driver come directly from God.

And for Lewis Hamilton, it seems the best way of giving thanks for his good luck was to have a giant cross tattooed on his back.

The Formula One star showed off the eye-catching artwork on a beach holiday in Malibu with his girlfriend, singer Nicole Scherzinger.

It is the latest in a string of religious tattoos for the 28-year-old, who always wears a crucifix round his next while racing.

Mr Hamilton, a Christian and regular churchgoer, also has the image of an angel etched into his right forearm and a picture of Mary and Jesus on his upper arm.

Above the cross on his back are the words ‘Still I Rise’.

The phrase is the title of a celebrated poem by African-American poet Maya Angelou. However, Mr Hamilton may be more familiar with a rap song of the same name by his favourite musician Tupac Shakur.

Tupac’s song Keep Ya Head Up was inspired by Angelou’s poem. A posthumous album of his rap songs was called Still I Rise when it was released in 1999, three years after his death.

The song’s message of individual resilience over difficult circumstances no doubt appealed to Mr Hamilton, who has struggled with his form since becoming the youngest ever Formula One world champion in 2008.

Following a series of crashes in 2011, Mr Hamilton quoted the phrase in a press conference. He said: ‘Obviously I’d like to be winning and doing a better job. Am I in the best place in my life? No, there’s been a lot of negative stories.

1. A giant crucifix on his back echoing the one he always wears round his neck. Hamilton said: ‘My faith is important to 
me. You have to remain hopeful, you have to believe there is a plan. I 
believe God has a plan for me. I don’t know what it is.’ 2. The words ‘Still I Rise’. Hamilton has quoted the inspirational phrase in 
press conferences. It is the title of a poem by Maya Angelou published 
in 1978, and inspired Hamilton’s favourite rap artist Tupac Shakur.3. Picture of a heart and cross on his right elbow, and musical notes on 
his right wrist. Hamilton Tweeted pictures of the tattoos in February 
after having them done by Los Angeles tattoo artist Mister Cartoon, real
name Mark Machado.4 and 5. 
Religious images on his arm include a picture of Mary and Jesus, and an 
angel. He said last year: “I had them done in the last couple of races 
but they’ve healed up now, although they’re not finished yet. One’s an 
angel and the other is of the Pieta - Mary and Jesus.’

‘But what’s most important is still I rise. I’m here, fighting again.’

Mr Hamilton - who has been dating X Factor judge Miss Scherzinger since 2008 - describes himself as a ‘true believer’ and believes that his Christian faith has helped him achieve success on the track.

In 2007, he said: ‘I really believe that my talent is God-given. I know I’m truly blessed. But I’ve also worked hard to get to where I am - and becoming world champion will make me work even harder.’ 

The racing star has been collecting tattoos for several years, but recently admitted his father Anthony disapproves of them.

He said: ‘My dad doesn’t approve of the tattoos but I don’t need approval I am comfortable with who I am, I don’t need someone telling me. If someone doesn’t accept me for who I am, that is their problem. You need to be proud of who you are.’ 

He added: ‘I haven’t just started to do it. I’ve been doing it for some time. I grew up around them and always wanted to get them.’
