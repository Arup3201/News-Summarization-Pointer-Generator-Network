Britain's green and pleasant lands have been transformed to scorched earth as the country records the driest September since records began in 1910.

This month is also likely to finish in the top five warmest, with UK mean temperatures significantly above the monthly average and today reaching a summery 23C in some areas. 

According to figures released today, this September was even warmer than August across parts of the UK. The Central England Temperature of 15.3C was 1.2C above the mean for 1981-2010, making the month - rarely - warmer than August, said weather historian Philip Eden.

It was the warmest September since 2006, and in the last 100 years only three were warmer, two had the same mean temperature, while 95 were cooler.

Parts of the River Wharfe in North Yorkshire have completely dried up due to lack of rainfall, leaving a rocky scar across the arid countryside. And Hollowell Reservoir, in Northamptonshire, is running at just 50 per cent of its normal level, reduced to little more than a trickle of its former glory.

According to Met Office figures some areas of the UK have had less than 20mm of rainfall for the whole of September, just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall for the month.

But forecasters warn 'change is afoot' with a much wetter and windier picture for the beginning of October, although it is likely to remain warmer than normal.

It will start to feel cooler with the mercury dropping to single figures in the north and low double figures elsewhere overnight on Wednesday, they say.

Met Office spokeswoman Nicky Maxey said an area of low pressure moving over the UK will trigger a change in the weather from Thursday.

She said: 'We have got a change in the weather coming up, until now we have had high pressure bringing settled conditions but low pressure is about to dominate towards the weekend.

'It is going to start on Thursday with gales and heavy rain in the northwest and Scotland, then on Friday and Saturday it will move southwards bringing more unsettled conditions.

'Temperatures will also move closer to normal for the time of year and it seems the unsettled weather will continue through much of October.'

September follows on from the 8th wettest August on record and the wettest winter on record at the start of the year which saw large swathes of Somerset under floodwater.

Using figures from September 1-28, the UK as a whole has received 19.4mm of rain, just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall which would be expected for the month. Before this one, the driest September on record was 1959 with 23.8mm.

Northamptonshire has only had 58 per cent average rainfall from January to the end of September, making it the driest first ten months of the year since 1929

 England, Wales and Scotland are likely to have their second driest September on record, with 13.5mm, 11.9mm and 33.3mm of rain respectively

Looking at individual countries, Northern Ireland should break the record for September dryness with only 6.5mm of rain, just 7 per cent of the average. The previous record was set in 1986, with 9.7mm.

England, Wales and Scotland are likely to have their second driest September on record, with 13.5mm, 11.9mm and 33.3mm of rain respectively. Records were set in 1959 (7.9mm), 1959 (11.7mm) and 1972 (31.7mm) respectively.

This September follows on from the eighth wettest August on record and comes in a generally very wet year - this January to August is the wettest such period in the records, mainly as a result of the very wet start to the year and the wettest winter on record.

This means water levels remain sufficient. Trevor Bishop, Environment Agency deputy director of water resources, said: 'Following the wettest January to August on record, water resources in England are around normal for the time of year.

'We also look ahead by modelling how rivers and groundwater may respond to different future rainfall patterns. The results show a broadly positive picture and even if rainfall is below average this autumn the country will not go into drought.'

The mean temperature for the UK so far has been 13.9C, which is 1.2C above the long-term average. This means it has been the joint fourth warmest September in the records back to 1910, but is well below the record of 15.2C set in 2006.

Sunshine amounts have been closer to average, with 94 per cent of what would normally be expected across the UK.

The dry and warm conditions have been caused by high pressure dominating the weather for much of the month.

This tends to block more unsettled weather heading in off the Atlantic, leaving the UK fine, dry and fairly sunny.

Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, said parts of the UK could see more than 50mm (2 inches) of rain fall on Friday night.

He said: 'A big pattern change as much wetter weather is on its way to the UK. Get brollies and coats ready.

Elsewhere today, people made the most of the hot weather during lunch time in Castle Park, Bristol, as temperatures remain high for the end of September

'The weather will feel very autumnal by the weekend and next week as low pressure takes control of our weather.

'An active cold front will edge southwards on Friday and Saturday, and is likely to bring some high rainfall totals to Scotland, Ireland, northwest England and northwest Wales.

'25 to more than 50mm is possible on Friday night to early Saturday with the highest totals Cumbria and southern Scotland.

'The weather then becoming a lot cooler by the weekend and very unsettled next week with more widespread rain.

'Latest forecasts suggest the UK will receive 150-200 per cent of normal precipitation next week, and often windy too.'

Regent's Park was bathed in balmy conditions throughout today. The Met Office's three-month contingency planner states temperatures are likely to remain above average during October, November and December

James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather said: 'As we progress throughout this weekend and into next week a major change is set to take place to a more autumnal type weather pattern.

'Low pressure will become a widespread and more dominant feature and this will result in some markedly cooler temperatures across many parts of the country.

'It will also become rather unsettled and stormy with periods of rain for many parts of the country, which will also be accompanied by some very strong to gale force winds, in particular, in parts of the north.'

However the good news is there is no sign of a big freeze this winter with generally warmer than normal conditions expected until the end of the year.

The Met Office's three-month contingency planner states temperatures are likely to remain above average during October, November and December.

It states: 'The latest predictions for UK-mean temperature favour above-average temperatures for both October and October-November-December as a whole.

'Overall, the probability that the UK-mean temperature for October-November-December will fall into the warmest of our five categories is around 35 pert cent and the probability of falling into the coldest of our five categories is close to 10 per cent.'

This month's dry spell means river beds have dried up and some reservoirs low – but experts say there was enough rain throughout the rest of the year so it is not officially a drought
