Andrew Mitchell went to war with ‘amateur’ Downing Street and Scotland Yard yesterday – attacking David Cameron’s judgment and the impartiality of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe.

The attack comes as the Police Federation, the body representing rank-and-file officers, has ordered a review into how it handled the episode.

The body has been accused of 'stoking up' Mitchell's alleged bust-up, which led to him quitting the Cabinet.

At war: Former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell, left, has launched a withering attack on the impartiality of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, right,

Police Federation chairman Paul 
McKeever said he would apologies to the politician if it was proved that
he did not call police officers 'plebs'.

The body was vocal in its opposition 
to Mitchell's alleged behaviour, with some branches organising protests 
where officers wore 'PC Pleb' t-shirts.

Friends of the former chief whip said 
it was ‘mindblowing’ that the Prime Minister had allowed Mr Mitchell to 
resign despite knowing that CCTV footage cast grave doubt on claims by 
police in Downing Street that he called them ‘plebs’.

Mr Mitchell’s allies said he was not 
even allowed to see the video before he resigned but was instead left 
‘swinging in the wind’.

Tory MPs also called on Scotland Yard to suspend the two diplomatic protection officers whose log made the claims while the force runs a criminal investigation into the events of last September.

The CCTV footage shows Mr Mitchell being refused permission to pass through the gates of Downing Street but not the blazing row the police claim then occurred, nor the members of the public who were allegedly ‘visibly shocked’ at the argument.

Mr Mitchell admits swearing but not using the word ‘plebs’.

Up to 30 Scotland Yard detectives are investigating after it emerged a third policeman posed as a member of public and falsely claimed to have witnessed the row in an email to Tory deputy chief whip John Randall.

Mr Cameron and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood viewed the footage and concluded that it undermined the email. But the Prime Minister decided not to confront the police who were on the scene and, crucially, did not show the video to Mr Mitchell to use in his defence.

Friends of the former chief whip said it was 'mindblowing' that David Cameron, on a visit to Camp Bastion Afghanistan, allowed Andrew Mitchell to resign

Branding it ‘amateur hour’ in No 10, a close friend of Mr Mitchell said: ‘It is just extraordinary they did not release something that could have knocked down the central piece of evidence against him. All they had to do was release 30 seconds of footage.

‘To trade that against a wish not to upset the police seems to me to put expediency so far ahead of a sense of morality as to be mindblowing.

‘It raises serious questions about Cameron’s judgment. The approach was to leave this swinging in the wind rather than raise questions with the police.’

The source said he agreed that the two police officers who made the original claim should be suspended pending the results of the investigation.

Another Tory MP said: ‘I don’t understand why the two policemen who wrote the log haven’t been suspended while the inquiry is going on.

‘There are clear discrepancies between their account and the CCTV footage. They seem to have a case to answer.’

Mr Mitchell’s allies have also let it be known that he has little faith in the impartiality of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe after he said the CCTV evidence did not contradict the police log. But he has been placated by Scotland Yard putting deputy assistant commissioner Pat Gallan in charge of the probe.

CCTV from Downing Street, as shown on Channel 4 News, suggests there was not a group of tourists at the gates at the time of the incident

Last night, Downing Street declined to say when Mr Mitchell had been given the video but pointed out that the Prime Minister stood by him for several weeks after the incident, despite repeated calls for his sacking.

Mr Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson both backed Mr Hogan-Howe.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has full confidence in the Metropolitan police commissioner and believes the police should be allowed to carry out the investigation.’

Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: ‘The Mayor has absolute confidence in the commissioner, who has assured him that he is determined to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible.’

Yesterday Mr Cameron revealed that he met privately with Mr Mitchell last week and had been keen to keep him.

Mr Mitchell’s allies say he would ‘tear Cameron’s arm off’ if he were offered his old job of International Development Secretary back in a reshuffle.

Speaking during his visit to Afghanistan, Mr Cameron said: ‘I think there is a lot of sympathy for Andrew because the revelation about the email... has shocked quite a lot of people.’

He said that he spoke to the Sutton Coldfield MP on Monday, adding that he was in a ‘calm and rational mood’ given the ‘disturbing revelations’.

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said Mr Hogan-Howe will answer questions about the affair on January 14.

Police Federation chief Paul McKeever has handed control to his successor-elect Steve Williams just over a month before he is officially due to leave the role, due to 'pre-existing leave arrangements'.

Announcing a review of the body, he said: 'Recent events have shown that there are issues around the way the Police Federation nationally is able to lead and co-ordinate at a national, regional and local level.'

'As we enter a new era, my first act as chairman is to establish this independent panel to ensure that we as the Federation continue to represent the interests of our members in the most effective and efficient way.'
