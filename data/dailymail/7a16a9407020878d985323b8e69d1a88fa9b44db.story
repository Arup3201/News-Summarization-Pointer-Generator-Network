Two Libyan soldiers who were being trained in the UK behaved like a 'pack preying on women' as they stalked them in the dark to sexually assault them, a court has heard.

Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, rode stolen bicycles from their barracks to Cambridge where they touched the lone women sexually and tried to put their hands up their skirts.

Abdalsalam admitted two counts of sexual assault, one count of threatening behaviour towards a police officer and one count of theft.

The two Libyan soldiers cycled from the base in Bassingbourn in Cambridgeshire to the city to stalk women 

El Maarfi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of exposure and one count of theft.

A third man, Khaled El Azibi, 18, charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft refused to enter pleas at the hearing. 

The court heard how the soldiers - who all appeared in court wearing tracksuits - are based at Bassingbourn Barracks some 14 miles outside Cambridge.

Prosecutor Paul Brown told the court: 'The most serious aspect of it it there are males targeting females under the cover of darkness.

'They are like a pack preying on women in the hours of darkness.

'These women were by themselves at night and they were vulnerable.'

Mr Brown said the first victim was walking on her own at 10.30pm when the men approached her before touching her at 'various times'.

El Maarfi then exposed his penis to her.

Mr. Brown said: 'She was clearly distressed by the incident.'

The crimes were caught on CCTV and the 'pack' was seen to ride off.

They then met two more women who were together and sexually assaulted them.

The soldiers left the barracks on stolen bikes and made their way to Cambridge where they stalked women

Cambridge magistrates said they were unable to sentence the two who pleaded guilty and they will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a later date.

They were both remanded in custody together with El Azibi whose case will be dealt with at the higher court.

The court heard that the two soldiers who pleaded guilty have been told they are not allowed to return to their camp and are 'likely' to face deportation.

They were remanded in custody because they 'have nowhere to go' and are a 'danger to the public'.

Up to 2,000 Libyan troops are due to be trained at Bassingbourn in separate groups over a 15 month period, with the aim of them returning home and helping to achieve Philip Hammond's aim to make the country more stable. 

More than 300 Libyan soldiers arrived at the barracks in June to start a 24-week course.

They are being taught basic infantry and junior command skills in a bid to help bring stability to the war-torn country on their return.

They are currently being trained by the 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Bassingbourn has been beset by problems after three North African soldiers stationed there were detained after breaking orders not to go tothe local Tesco. 

The incident escalated when up to 20 of their comrades stormed the area where they were being kept to demand their release.
