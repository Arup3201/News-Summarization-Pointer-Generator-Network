Hope: Paul Gascoigne is 'out of danger'

Paul Gascoigne is ‘out of danger’ after being taken to intensive care in the US last week, according to friends.

It is understood the former England international suffered an adverse reaction to a detoxification course at a clinic, where he was being treated for alcohol addiction.

Gascoigne, 45, was admitted to the Cottonwood clinic near Tuscon, Arizona, days after a video emerged of him sobbing and incoherent on stage in front of a room full of fans.

Former Tottenham Hotspur team-mate Gary Mabbutt said Gascoigne was recovering and would soon be well enough to return to the clinic.

He added: ‘The first thing he underwent at the clinic was a detox.

'Unfortunately, Paul had a very bad reaction to the detox and the clinic decided that as a precaution it was best to transfer him to hospital.

‘He’s recovering and hopefully soon he will be back into the clinic to continue his rehab.’

'Over the years he has had a lot of support from the football family, but of course it could be a long road to recovery. Now Paul's asked for the help we can focus on getting through this.'

Gary Lineker had said that his friend is
'struggling'. The Match of the Day presenter wrote on Twitter last 
night: 'Gazza is struggling, Let's hope he can hang on in there.'

The star flew to the U.S. 
last week where he was due to be treated at a rehabilitation clinic in 
Tucson, Arizona. Instead, he was taken to a nearby hospital where he has
spent the past four days.

According
to sources, his condition has stabilised, although it is not clear when
he will be well enough to attend his rehab course.

A
group of celebrity friends – including Chris Evans, Gary Lineker and 
Piers Morgan – had paid for Gascoigne to attend the clinic, which costs 
about £30,000 for an eight-week stay.

Since
then a number of England players, among them Wayne Rooney, have stepped
forward with offers of funds. Comedian James Corden has also donated 
money.

Gascoigne 
‘willingly’ flew to the States for help days after a video emerged of 
him sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.

Concern: Gary Lineker, who has helped fund Gascoigne's treatment in the US, last said that his former teammate was 'struggling'

But when he landed in Arizona he was pictured drinking a pint at the airport bar, before a friend took it off him.

The Cottonwood Clinic, which boasts a team of ‘highly trained clinicians’, has ‘been effective for him previously’, his management company said.

Gascoigne has previously received help at
The Providence Projects rehabilitation centre in Dorset, whose 
treatment director Paul Spanjar was instrumental  in sending him to the 
US.

Mr Spanjar called at the former footballer’s home last week after the video became public – and found him ‘in terrible shape’ at 9.30am.

He said: ‘He was certainly under the influence. Physically he had really deteriorated.’

He added that Gascoigne had fallen off the wagon over the past six weeks, saying: ‘At times myself or a colleague would go round to check that he was still alive.

It seemed as though he had a death wish.’

Gascoigne made 57 appearances for  his country.

England manager Roy Hodgson said his captain, Steven Gerrard, has gone to the FA and ‘told them the players would like to contribute’.

He added: ‘Many of them looked up to him as the star player of the day, and I can only back that up.’

In his Mail on Sunday Live magazine column today, Chris Evans writes: ‘When I saw the pictures of my old pal last week at a so-called personal appearance, even I was shocked.

‘I say even I, because I’ve seen him bad before; much worse than you might imagine.

'Paul has been on the edge for well over a decade now, although admittedly never closer than of late.’
