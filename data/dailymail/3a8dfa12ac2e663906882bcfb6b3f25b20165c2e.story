Investigators have searched the home 
of the father of a 13-year-old boy, whose bones were found in 
southwestern Colorado.

Dylan Redwine's remains were 
discovered in the mountains after snows melted, seven months 
after he disappeared last November.

The boy's father, Mark Redwine, said a search with a warrant
had been carried out yesterday on his home near Vallecito Lake.

Tragic: The remains of Dylan Redwine, 13, were found last week in southwest Colorado after he disappeared during a court-ordered visit to his father's house over Thanksgiving

He told KUSA-TV in Denver that investigators removed sections of carpet and wood flooring, dug a hole in his yard, and took a fireplace poker, clothing and a cellphone.

Dylan lived north of Colorado Springs
with his mother but went to his father's home near Vallecito Lake for a
court-ordered visit in November. Mark Redwine has said he returned home
from doing errands to find his son gone.

No suspects have been named in Dylan's death.

A La Plata County sheriff's spokesman didn't immediately return an email late Wednesday.

Elaine Redwine told KUSA-TV last month that whoever killed her son was a monster for leaving his body at the mercy of wildlife.

Speaking after Dylan's bones were found, she said, 'he deserved so much more.'

Gone: The disappearance gathered national attention

Dylan lived in the Monument area with 
his mother but arrived in La Plata County on November 18 for a court-ordered
visit in Vallecito with his father, Mark Redwine.

The father says he returned home from running errands November 19 to find Dylan was gone.

The case drew national attention and his divorced parents accused each other of responsibility for his disappearance.

Elaine Redwine says she's grateful she asked her son for a hug before he left for that visit.

But she never thought he wouldn't come back home.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation told sheriff's officials on Thursday that testing indicated the remains were Dylan's.

'The
parents are obviously devastated. It's not the kind of news we were 
hoping to give them. We were hoping to find him alive,' Durango police 
Lt. Ray Shupe said. 'Our hearts are broken that this is the end result.'

About 45 officers spent five days searching a 12-mile stretch of Middle Mountain Road looking for clues in the case this week.

The search had been planned as a follow-up after snow melted this spring.

The remains were found about 8 to 10 miles from Mark Redwine's home via rural roads, Bender said.

Shupe declined to comment on what else searchers found with Dylan's remains, or how and when Dylan might have died.

'Now that we've found him, our next mission is to find exactly what happened to him,' he said.
