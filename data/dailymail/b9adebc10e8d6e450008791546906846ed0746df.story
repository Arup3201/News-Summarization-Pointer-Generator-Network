Vladamir Putin has launched an astonishing attack against U.S. Senator John McCain claiming the former Navy pilot has 'blood on his hands' and that his ordeal as a Vietnam PoW had driven him 'nuts'.

As protests continue across Russia over allegations of vote-rigging, Prime Minister Putin gave an incendiary television interview in which he described McCain as a war criminal and accused America of masterminding the killing of Colonel Gaddafi. 

McCain had earlier goaded the former KGB officer with a Twitter 
post saying 'Dear Vlad, the Arab Spring is coming to a neighborhood near you'.

In response, a fired-up Putin, well known for his dislike of Washington, hit back saying: 'Mr McCain fought in Vietnam. I think that he has enough blood of peaceful citizens on his hands.

'It must be impossible for him to live without these disgusting scenes anymore.

'Mr McCain was captured and they kept him not just in prison, but in a pit for several years.

'Anyone (in his place) would go nuts.'

Putin also alleged that America had masterminded the death of former Libyan Leader Colonel Gaddafi's.

Describing the event he said: 'Who did this? Drones, including American ones.

'They attacked his column. Then using the radio - through the Special Forces, who should not have been there - they brought in the so-called opposition and fighters, and killed him without court or investigation.'

The beleaguered Russian accused organisers of the protests currently gripping the country of working to weaken the county on orders from the West.

He insisted that the 4 December parliamentary election which triggered Russia's biggest protests for 20 years was a genuine reflection of the people's will.

He added: 'That's a well-organized pattern of destabilizing society.'

Putin even sought to put a good spin on the protests by saying they reflected a rise in public activity that he welcomes.

Last week, he dismissed criticism of the vote by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of American efforts to weaken Russia.

Russian
 billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov plans to challenge Vladimir Putin in 
Russia's spring presidential election.

He has said his first move if 
elected would be to pardon jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who has 
been in prison since 2003 on tax evasion and fraud charges seen as a 
punishment for defying Putin's power.

Prokhorov said he would also allow
 free registration of opposition parties and restore elections for 
provincial governors.

He is 46 years old, and worth an estimated $18 billion, having made his fortune in metals, banking and media.    

On Thursday he alleged that the 
organisers of Saturday's Moscow demonstration had paid some of its 
participants and called them sheep.

He
 also unleashed his occasional penchant for barbed and crude remarks by 
dismissing the white ribbons that many demonstrators wore.

'When I saw them on TV I thought it was 
part of campaigning for HIV prophylactics, and they put some 
contraceptives on,' he said.

The ribbons have become a widely adopted 
symbol of the protests.His dismissive comments and 
insistence that the recent election was valid are likely to fuel further
 anger and may draw even bigger crowds to protests planned for this 
month.

Putin
 said the results of Russia's parliamentary election reflected popular 
opinion, and that the opposition had alleged vote fraud purely to 
strengthen its position.

'The
 results of this election undoubtedly reflect the real balance  of power 
in the country,' he said. 'It's very good that United Russia has 
preserved its leading position.

His dismissive comments and 
insistence that the recent election was valid are likely to fuel further
 anger and may draw even bigger crowds to protests planned for this 
month.

'The opposition's goal is to fight for power, and it's looking for every chance to advance.'

The unprecedented wave of protest 
currently sweeping Russia poses a significant challenge to Putin less 
than three months before presidential elections in which he will be 
seeking to return to the Kremlin.

On Thursday he sought to counter 
public discontent by proposing to place web cameras at each of Russia's 
more than 90,000 polling stations before the 4 March presidential vote.

'Let them be there next to every ballot box to avoid any falsifications,' he said.
