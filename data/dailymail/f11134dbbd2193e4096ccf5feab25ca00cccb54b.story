If you love history, drama and strategy the re-enactment of a medieval chess set played with real-life people and horses in Veneto, Italy, is something that has to be seen.

The unique  game is played bi-annually in September at the Piazza degli Scacchi (Chess Square) in Marostica.

The remarkable two-hour extravaganza is played out with  intrinsic medieval detail and a mix of 550 walk-on parts, all of whom are dressed in full medieval costume.

There are also dozens of colourful gonfalons, fire displays, dancing and ancient music throughout the show.

The performance, which draws tourists from far and wide, is so successful that performers have been invited to travel as far away as Toronto in Canada to perform their inspiring medieval routine.

The event was inspired by a real game of chess, which was played with living pawns back in 1454 when Marostica was a region of the Republic of Venice.

In 1454 two noble knights fell in love with Lionora, who was the beautiful daughter of the Lord of the manor of Marostica Taddeo Parisio.

It was customary at the time for two men who sought the hand of the same woman to enter into a duel, however, Mr Parisio was reluctant to lose one of his men and instead he ordered them to compete in a chess game.

The unique game was set up with living pawns and the two men had to direct them which moves to take.

The chess game took place in the midst of a celebration day which attracted noblemen and peasants and included music, parades of knights and foot soldiers, fires and jugglers.

The innovative event was devised as an ideal way to replace bloodshed with a positive celebration and the success of the chess game has been preserved and re-enacted to this day.
