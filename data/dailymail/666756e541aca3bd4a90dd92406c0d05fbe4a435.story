Determined not to let the Italian court's judgement over whether she was responsible for the murder of Meredith Kercher keep her in hiding, Amanda Knox strolls hand-in-hand with her fiancé.

The 27-year-old was joined by musician Colin Sutherland and her mother, Edda Mellas, as they took a brief walk outside her family home in Seattle, Washington, on Thursday evening.

Knox and Sutherland, 27,  clasped their hands together but both appeared nervous and sported serious expressions, with neither smiling, as they took advantage of the spring evening.

Knox’s family are rallying around her and trying to help her lead as normal a life as possible in the run up to the final decision by the Court of Cassation - Italy's highest court - in Rome on Friday.

Shortly before their walk, Sutherland was seen carrying a bag of ice and two bags of shopping into the house, possibly supplies for a long and agonizing night waiting for the verdict.

Earlier on Thursday, Amanda – who in 2013 penned memoir Waiting to be Heard about the murder case and her four years in jail - was spotted with her fiance writing on a notepad in the backyard.

The Italian court is set to decide if it will uphold a 2013 ruling declaring Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the 2007 killing of the British exchange student. The decision was due on Wednesday but has been delayed.

And today, Sollecito's lawyer launched a last-ditch attempt to save his own skin and blow a hole in American's defense. The former lover was compared to a 'Forrest Gump' caught up in events beyond his understanding.

Knox and Sollecito had originally been convicted in 2009, but were acquitted in 2011, allowing Knox to fly back to her hometown in the US, although the verdict was then reversed in 2013.

There are a number of possible outcomes to the trial: Either both Knox and Sollecito will be found guilty, they will both be declared not guilty, one will be convicted but not the other, or the whole thing could go back for another round of appeal.

Even if the trial does end in a conviction, former judge Mike Heavey – who has long championed Knox’s cause and become close to her family, even being invited to her wedding - says he feels there is little chance of her being extradited to Italy for the 28 and a half year sentence she has been handed if convicted.

Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online, he said: ‘I imagine it’s been very tense for [the Knox family]. I’m optimistic the case will be dismissed and they’ll be acquitted.

‘Well respected scientists are coming in and debunking the DNA evidence against them and public opinion [in Italy] has gone from 90% against to around 80% for her.

‘Raffaele was in court Wednesday which is good. They never really aimed at Raffaele, it’s always been Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. Very sexist, by the way, very anti-American.

‘But this has been a witch-hunt, as if it was Salem, Massachusetts, 1691. No different except that it goes global.

‘And it titillates a great percentage of people, they find is fascinating, this idea of a sex orgy gone wrong and two pretty girls that was originally put forward by the prosecution.’

Referring to the 2003 kidnapping and transportation to Egypt of Italian cleric Abu Omar by the CIA and the subsequent conviction in absentia by an Italian court of ex-CIA operative Robert Seldon Lady for that crime, he added: ‘There’s good reasons to dislike the Americans, we’ve done a lot of bad things around the world, I can agree with a lot of their criticisms.

Ms Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in Perugia in 2007.

‘Our CIA kidnapped an Islamic cleric, an Italian citizen, and they can’t get their minister of justice to ask the US for an extradition, they can’t get it done, so they’re frustrated.

‘[But in this case] Raffaele is collateral damage. If we confirm their convictions, we send an innocent Italian man – and the people probably won’t like that – to prison, and the [Italian] Minister of Justice probably won’t even ask for extradition, but even if he did are they going to pick a fight with the United states of America on a false claim?

‘The kidnapping of an Italian citizen – that’s a legitimate claim and they still don’t want to take on the USA. So are they going to take on the US on a B.S. claim?

‘No. It’s a fraud, and everybody knows it and everybody is playing along.'

If Knox is declared guilty, the decision to extradite her back to Italy ultimately rests in the hand of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry.
