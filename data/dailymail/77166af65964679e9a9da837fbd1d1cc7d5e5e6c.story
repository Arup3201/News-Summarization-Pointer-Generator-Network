Jessica Meecham, 20, is facing jail after admitting calling police to report a theft while drunk outside a pub then attacking officers when they arrived

A drunk woman growled at a police car and then attacked two officers after calling them to report a theft from outside a pub, a court heard today.

Jessica Meechan, 20, was on a night out at The Coach House in Bristol when a fight broke out.

When police arrived Meechan charged at the window of their unmarked vehicle and began growling.

She was then arrested and assaulted two officers - spitting in the face of a WPC and pinching the thigh of her male colleague.

Meechan admitted two charges of assaulting a police officer and one of being drunk and disorderly.

District judge Simon Cooper adjourned the hearing at Bristol Magistrates’ Court for a pre-sentence report - but warned Meechan she faced prison.

He told her: 'The purpose of this sentence will be punishment. You need to be taught a lesson.'

Prosecuting, Chris Holland said the officers were called to the Coach House pub on Stapleton Road after reports of a fight.

He said: 'On arrival the defendant was located outside the premises. The defendant proceeded to charge at the window of an unmarked police vehicle and growl.

'She was making threats about an unnamed person, saying 'I am going to stab her up, I will kill her next time'.

'She was behaving in a volatile manner.'

Mr Holland said PC Gethin and WPC Pendleton arrested Meechan after arriving at the pub at 2.30am on October 25 last year.

Meechan spat in the face of WPC Pendleton and then pinched the thigh of PC Gethin before being taken to a nearby police station.

Police were called to The Coach House pub in Bristol where they were attacked by Meechan

When interviewed Meechan claimed she had been beaten by two girls in the pub's toilet who stole her mobile phone and £45.

She said she was then thrown out of the pub by the landlord and that she had called police to investigate the theft.

Graham Arnall, defending, said Meechan, of Easton, Bristol, had been injured in the attack by the girls.

He said: 'She had black eyes, cuts and swelling to her face consistent with punches.

'She wanted the police to help her.'

The court heard that Meechan has four previous convictions for assaulting police officers, two for battery and a number of drunk and disorderly offences.
