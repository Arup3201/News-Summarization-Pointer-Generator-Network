A wedding's not a wedding without an embarrassing dad hellbent on humiliating his family with his dodgy dance moves.

But what happens when that dad's 11-year-old son has moves to match?

Two words: dance off.

That's what happened when Shawn Hanaee's sister got married last month in Royal Oak, Michigan.

The telecommunications account executive and son Anthony had mum cringing by the canapes when they launched into a pre-planned dance battle in a bid to get the wedding party started.

And as this hilarious video shows, there was a marked difference in the pair's respective choice of songs.

Everybody Dance Now: Shawn (left) - who posted the video to YouTube - takes on classic hits like 'Tootsee Roll' and 'Everybody Dance Now', while Anthony (right) got down to a mix of more modern hits including Beyonce's 'Single Ladies' and Psy's 'Gangnam Style.'

Who won? Well, it's a close call. But going by crowd reaction, it sounds like dad may have just pipped his son to the prize.
