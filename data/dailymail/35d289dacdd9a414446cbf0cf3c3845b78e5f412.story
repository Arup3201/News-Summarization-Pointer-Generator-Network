Having tried for a baby for seven years, Nicola and Andrew Stone were heartbroken when two expensive rounds of IVF failed to yield a pregnancy.

But determined to try and have child, they decided to opt for one more cycle - this time, with a twist.

The couple asked for a special procedure they had read about in the hope it might give them the son or daughter they had dreamed of.

The technique involves using a special adhesive to fix the couple's embryo to the wall of Mrs Stone's womb.

And to their delight, this resulted in the birth of Sophia Elsie-May, described by her parents as their 'little miracle'.

Before Sophia Elsie-May (pictured) was born, Mr and Mrs Stone had endured two failed attempts of IVF, which had cost them £10,000

Mrs Stone, 34, of Ripley, Derby: 'We're so happy. I didn't think it would work but I'm so glad it did. Sophia is everything we wished for.

'All I wanted was to be a mummy, but there were so many problems to sort out. Now she's here, we're so happy.'

Mrs Stone was told to lose weight to help her conceive and Mr Stone, 47, a self-employed builder, was advised to take a variety of vitamins and minerals such as zinc to give his low sperm count a boost.

But they also received the advanced glue treatment before Sophia was born in July.

Mrs Stone said: 'My embryos were dipped in glue and the lining of my womb was scratched so that everything would implant.

'As the lining heals, doctors think it helps to keep the embryo safe and in place.'

Mr and Mrs Stone started trying for a baby in 2007, two years before they married, but when nothing happened after a year, the pair went to see the doctor.

'A test revealed that Andrew's sperm count was desperately low and I was told that my BMI was too high,' Mrs Stone said.

'It was a shock to find out that Andrew had problems and I didn't know just how serious being overweight was in terms of becoming a parent.

Embryoglue has been used in a handful of fertility clinics since 2012, but is unknown to most couples struggling to conceive.

It is usually used as a last resort after couples have tried two rounds of IVF without success.

In the final stages of their third course of IVF, the embryo is dipped in a strongly adhesive gluey substance prior to being put back into the womb.

It sticks to the side of the mother's womb, increasing the chance of implantation of the embryo to the uterus.

The product, which doctors describe as working like 'superglue', is made with naturally occurring ingredients.

It also supports embryo development as it is enriched with nutrients and energy sources.

Research has shown that using the glue increases birth rate by eight per cent.

Dr Lucy Jenner, embryology manager at Care Fertility, Nottingham, said: 'There are lots of new ways for us to be able to maximise the chances of a pregnancy following IVF and it seems that Andy and Nicola have used all of them at once, which is quite unusual.

'Embryoglue is a natural substance we use to help 'super glue' the embryo in place and it seems to have done the trick this time.' 

'My BMI was 36 and that was way too high and I was advised to get it down to 31, which meant losing about three stone.

'Before the first IVF effort, I had lost a stone. I was feeling quite hopeful. 

'Andrew had managed to produce some healthy sperm and we were positive.'

But two attempts ended in failure and the couple were devastated.

Mrs Stone said: 'We decided to have one last attempt at IVF. We were offered a new treatment in which the embryos are incubated in a different way.

'We just wanted it to work. We would have done absolutely anything to have a healthy baby.'

A new video technique to monitor embryos was used and Mrs Stone was given the glue to help the embryo implant in the womb.

She said: 'I was so nervous because I knew we'd done so much this time. If this attempt failed, I knew we would be in serious trouble. The chances of having a baby would be zero.'

Two weeks after treatment, a pregnancy test confirmed she was pregnant.

'I cried and cried. It was a dream come true. All I ever wanted was to be a mum. Andrew was completely overwhelmed, too,' Mrs Stone said.

'I think it was 6am when we did the test. I hadn't slept a wink. 

'We waited until I was 13 weeks' pregnant before we told our family. 

'Everyone was so thrilled for us. Our parents had been so supportive. All we wanted was to tell them we were having a baby.

'It had taken us seven years to get pregnant. I never dreamed it would be such a long journey.'

Baby Sophia was born on July 14, 2014. She weighed a healthy 7lb 10oz.

'She was adorable and we were the proudest parents,' Mrs Stone said. 'Everything we'd been through seemed like a distant memory.

'When I held her in my arms, I cried with joy. We both did. Andrew cut her cord and it was wonderful. 

'One day, we'll tell her just how special she is. But for now, all I'm interested in is having some special time with my family.'

Mr and Mrs Stone, were unable to get IVF treatment on the NHS because they didn't meet the criteria.

They decided to fund private treatment themselves by missing out on holidays and trips out to save the cash to pay for treatment.

They had two failed attempts, costing a total of nearly £5,000 each before the final successful effort which cost more than £7,000.

Self-employed builder Mr Stone worked extra hours to help raise the money and family members also chipped in to help them.

'Money was never an issue we said that would give ourselves the best hope of having a baby no matter what it cost,' Mr Stone said.

'We went without holidays and stopped going out as much. We just said "It's either a holiday or a baby" - and it was no contest.'

'There was a lot of tears and heartache after the first two attempts failed. We had decided that with the third attempt it was all or nothing.

'We've gone through a lot over the last six years, but it has all been worth it in the end and we have our perfect little girl,' Mr Stone said

'Basically we were given a list of the things we could do to give us a better chance and the price list. 

'Nicola had been all internet forums and discussion groups and everybody was saying how successful the 'glue' option was so we asked for that as well.

'When Nicola did her first pregnancy test and it was positive we didn't dare believe it. 

'During that week she must have used seven or eight pregnancy testing kits and we still didn't really believe it until the first scan confirmed she was pregnant.
