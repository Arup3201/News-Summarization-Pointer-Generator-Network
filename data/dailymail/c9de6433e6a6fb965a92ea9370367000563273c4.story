Kirstie Alley is said to be 'livid' with her former friend Leah Remini after she ended her association with the Church Of Scientology last week.

The 62-year-old actress looked unusually downcast as she headed out in LA's Los Feliz over the weekend following the King of Queens star's dramatic exit from the controversial organization.

Scientology journalist Tony Ortega, who was the first to report Leah's defection on July 8 on The Underground Bunker, claims the long-time Scientology devotee spent hours in crisis talks with fellow celebrity Church members on July 10 after Leah made the decision to dissolve her union with the controversial organisation.

Huge furore: Leah is understood to have left the controversial Church

In a series of no-holds-barred, 
cryptic tweets posted on July 10, Kristie appeared to slam her friend of 30 years for spreading 
what she called 'malicious gossip'.

'When
 faced w malicious gossip I take a moment to experience the loss of the 
person I thought was my friend... Then I say f*** em..:)' she posted to 
her more than one million followers.

Six hours later, she followed up with 'the sweetest poison is often served with a smile...beware syrup' as she allegedly arrived at long-time Church member Melinda Brownstone's home for crisis talks.

Melinda was said to have been Leah's oldest and best friend, having met when she first moved to LA at the tender age of 13, however, all members have allegedly been instructed to 'disconnect' from the star immediately.

Former King Of Queens star Leah joined
 the Church with her mother in the 1970s after relocating to Los Angeles
 from Brooklyn to pursue her acting dream.

Long history: Kirstie has been a very vocal supporter of the Church Of Scientology since discovering the organisation in 1979

Leah
 reportedly called time on her association following years of interrogation for questioning the 
whereabouts of leader David Miscavige's wife, Shelly, who hasn't been 
seen since 2007.

In a statement released to People magazine on July 11, the 43-year-old thanked the public for supporting her decision to cut ties with the controversial church.

'I
 wish to share my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for the 
overwhelming positive response I have received from the media, my 
colleagues, and from fans around the world. I am truly grateful and 
thankful for all your support.'

Meanwhile, deep in conversation on 
her phone as she made her way to the Mustard Seed Cafe in Los Feliz on 
July 13, Kirstie wasn't able to muster a smile as she seemingly had the 
weight of the world on her shoulders.

The mother-of-two appeared not to have ran a comb through her hair or put on a lick of make-up.

A good distraction: The 62-year-old is currently busy working on a new sitcom, aptly titled Kirstie's New Show, which will premiere in the fall

Kirstie has been a very vocal supporter of the Church of Scientology since she became affiliated with them through a Narconon program that based its techniques on their beliefs and practices in 1979.

She credits the Church with helping her overcome her cocaine addiction.

'To tell you the honest-to-God truth: without Scientology, I would be dead. So, I can personally highly recommend it,' she says

Other famous long-time celebrity Scientology devotees include Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Jenna Elfman and Juliette Lewis.

MailOnline has reached out to Kirstie's spokesperson for comment but is yet to receive a response.
