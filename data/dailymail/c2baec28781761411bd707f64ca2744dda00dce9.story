A married Pennsylvania high school teacher has been arrested for having sexual relations with a male student.

The arrest came after the alleged victim's parents found a sexually explicit conversation on a laptop between 31-year-old Lauren Harrington-Cooper and the boy.

The parents went to Wyoming Valley West High School and informed the principal of the material Thursday and Harrington-Cooper, of Plymouth, was arraigned that night on a single count of institutional sexual assault.
