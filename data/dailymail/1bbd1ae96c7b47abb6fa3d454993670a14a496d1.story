A former major league pitcher who played for the New York Yankees and the Oakland Athletics has died in a climbing accident near his hometown in Texas. 

Brad Halsey, 33, was killed near his home outside New Braunfels, Texas, on Friday, his family says.

He pitched for three seasons in the major leagues, starting with the Yankees in 2004. He played for the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Oakland Athletics, before being sent down to the minor leagues and retiring from baseball.

He had a record of 14-19 with am ERA of 4.84. He appeared in 88 games and made 40 starts in the majors. 

He returned to his hometown of New Braunfels, a city of 60,000 30 miles outside San Antonio. 

USA Today reports that Halsey died Friday in a climbing accident.

The details of his death were not immediately available.

O'Connell Sports, the Halsey's former agent, announced his death on Tuesday night. 

'We are sorry to hear of the passing of longtime client, Brad Halsey. Our thoughts & prayers are with his family during this difficult time,' the agency tweeted. 

The Yankees drafted Halsey out of the University of Texas in 2002. He spent the next two seasons playing minor league ball before being called in to the majors in 2004.

The Yankees traded him to the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2005 as part of a deal for pitching great Randy Johnson.

In 2006, he was traded to the Oakland A's, where he gained two the top infamous moments of his career. He threw the pitch that Barry Bonds hit for his 714th career home run, tying Babe Ruth.

In 2007, he angrily criticized the A's front office for refusing to call him up to the majors from Triple-A Sacramento when he had an MRI scheduled. 

He claimed at the time that the team was only trying to avoid paying him the higher major league rates if he had to go on the disabled list.

'Then they send you down and screw you. I'm grinding it out, trying to be a team guy, and I get f***ed. It's all just a business decision, because if I came up and pitched Tuesday and then had an MRI and had to go on the DL, they'd have to pay me major-league DL money. It's such a mom-and-pop organization,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. 

After that, he bounced around minor league baseball teams until signing a minor league deal with the Yankees again. 

He later retired from baseball.
