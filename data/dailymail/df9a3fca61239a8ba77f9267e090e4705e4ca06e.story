Researchers have created a fabric circuit board that could be incorporated into clothing for a number of purposes.

One of these is the ability to create ‘smart bulletproof vests’ that could tell people away from the front line that the person wearing it has been shot.

And the team who made the fabric circuit board say it can be stretched a million times and washed 30 times with no detrimental effects.

Researchers at the Institute of Textiles and Clothing in Hong Kong have created an advanced fabric circuit board (FCB), shown. Their material is made by knitting yarn and copper fibres together. It can be stretched a million times without breaking

The fabric circuit board (FCB) was created by scientists at the Institute of Textiles and Clothing in Hong Kong reports New Scientist.

It is made of multiple filaments of pre-stretched elastic yarn and polyurethane-coated cobber fibres, which are combined with a knitting machine.

Speaking to MailOnline, research Qiao Li explained the FCB could be stretched and pulled a million times without it being damaged.

It could also be washed 30 times with no negative effects.

‘To the best of our knowledge, the performance of new FCBs has far exceeded those of previously reported metal-coated elastomeric films or other organic materials in terms of changes in electrical resistance, stretchability, fatigue life and washing capability as well as permeability,’ said Qiao Li.

She said the features made it particularly useful for the FCBs to be used in clothing, or 'next-to-skin electronic devices.'  

One of the most interesting features, though, is the ability for the FCBs to be used in bulletproof vests.

Qiao Li explains they made a ‘flexible and stretchable fabric sending network,’ to measure the strain and deformation of a smart bulletproof vest.

They put some of the FCBs inside energy-absorbing fabrics such as Kevlar to create the smart vests.

A bullet was then fired into the vest, and they found that the fabric circuits could register when they had been shot.

This means that, on the battlefield for example, they could send a signal to a medic when a solider has been hurt.

In addition they found that the strain of the shot did not destroy the circuits.

Teenagers in hoodies are stereotypically portrayed as uncommunicative.

But this could be about to change after a team of graduate students in June created a hooded sweatshirt that lets the wearer send subtle and covert messages.

Different pre-programmed texts can be sent using a number of gestures, so wearers can tell a friend they're free to chat or they're missing them, merely by touching their sleeve.

The smart sweatshirt was created by students at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP).

The prototype hoodie has a GSM radio and sensors sewn inside it, allowing the piece of clothing to respond to different gestures.

‘The knitted FCBs have shown excellent reliability during the ballistic impact tests as all the sensor network assembly samples performed well without mechanical and electrical failure and received reliable electrical signals,’ Qiao Li says.

Aside from bulletproof vests, other potential applications for the technology include electric fabric skin for bionic search robots.

Qiao Li also says it could be used in a ‘smart belt as an intelligent monitoring system for physiological and mechanical signals in sport of weightlifting.’

She adds: ‘Practically, knitted FCBs have great potentials in a wide range of applications, such as human/electronic interfaces, skin-mounted systems, as well as next-to-skin monitoring systems for health care.’

This is because the circuits can be deformed in three dimensions and can be bent and moved without breaking.
