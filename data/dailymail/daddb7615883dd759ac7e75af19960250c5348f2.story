More than two thirds of British adults say they have unfulfilled travel ambitions, according to a new study.

Research carried out by travel website lastminute.com into the nation’s holiday habits reveals that 34 million Brits over the age of 18 have unaccomplished travel dreams of seeing polar bears, storm chasing or trekking through the wilderness.

But despite ambitious fantasies, when it comes to booking holidays 29 million people, or 57 per cent of us, admitted being stuck in a holiday rut by travelling to the same places as previous years.

More than two thirds of British adults say they have unfulfilled travel ambitions including seeing polar bears, storm chasing or trekking through the wilderness, according to a survey of holiday habits by lastminute.com

The survey also showed that one in four Brits are hoping to escape four times or more this year, while the average Brit will get away nearly three times.

People plan to travel one extra day than they did last year - 16 compared to the 15 days taken in 2014.

One in four even admitted they won't hesitate to throw a sickie to extend their average 26 days of annual leave from work, while more than a quarter feel they didn't make the most of their annual leave last year.

We are also more willing to splash the cash on travel with 38 per cent willing to spend about the same as last year, 30 per cent a bit more and 10 per cent are prepared to double their 2014 travel spend, according to the research. 

White water rafting and free diving have made it in to the top ten activities to do while on holiday

However, not even 10 per cent will fulfil their lofty travel dreams, according to the research.

Instead, a majority will play it safe and opt for more traditional holidays.

While the UK continues to be the top travel destination for Britons (36 per cent), the strength of the pound versus the euro has seen a resurgence of Euro-zone countries making up the top five overseas destinations we want to visit.

A quarter of those polled said Spain was their favoured destination, followed by France with 18 per cent, the US with 13 per cent, Italy with 12 per cent and Greece with 10 per cent.

New trend destinations, although on a smaller level, include Austria, the Caribbean and Croatia.

When it comes to the types of travel Brits dream of this year, it is beach holidays and city breaks that rule, with a bit of weekend relaxation thrown in for good measure.

Sightseeing was the most popular activity for Brits while on holiday, with 54 per cent of people favouring it

The 2015 holiday ambitions study also found, we are no longer a nation of sun worshipers as we increasingly search for new and exciting experiences rather than a tan line.

This year, sunbathing slipped two places in the list of holiday priorities, and was overtaken by sightseeing, experiencing local food and cultural excursions in the top five holiday activity wish list. 

Sightseeing was the most popular activity for Brits while on holiday, with 54 per cent of people saying they would visit local attractions.

France was the second most popular overseas destination, with 18 per cent of Brits saying they wanted to visit. The US was in third place with 13 per cent, followed by Italy (12 per cent) and Greece (10 per cent)

Experiencing local food was rated as the second most popular activity, with 45 per cent of the vote, followed by cultural excursions with 39 per cent and sun bathing on 32 per cent.

Going to the theatre or opera accounted for 23 per cent of the vote, followed by spa treatments (17.9 per cent), snorkelling (14.1 per cent), hiking (12.1 per cent), white water rafting (8.7 per cent) and free diving (8.5 per cent) making up the top ten.

Reigo Eljas, trading director at lastminute.com, said: ‘When it comes to travel ambitions they seem a bit like New Year's resolutions: Good intentions, big dreams, high hopes - but in reality we don't see them through.

‘We all love a lazy beach holiday and want to see the Eiffel Tower, but this year we encourage people to be spontaneous and use one of their breaks to make their travel dreams become a reality.’
