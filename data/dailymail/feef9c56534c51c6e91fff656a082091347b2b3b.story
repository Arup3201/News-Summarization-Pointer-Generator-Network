An usher at the Barclayâ€™s Centre in Brooklyn was given a standing ovation after performing a jaw-dropping rendition of the U.S. national anthem.

Bryan Bautista was still wearing his uniform when he sang The Star-Spangled Banner at the Brooklyn Nets vs. New York Knicks game on Tuesday.

Normally stationed on the sidelines, Mr Bautista was at the centre of attention on the floor as he followed tradition, singing the anthem ahead of the game.

After being introduced as 'one of our own' by announcers at the Barclays Centre, he blew the crowd away with his performance of the national anthem.

Mr Bautista, a Brooklyn native, has been working at the Barclays Centre since it opened in September 2012.

He told a reporter that he had been smiling for a whole week after being asked to perform The Star-Spangled Banner.

Unfortunately, the game may have slightly tarnished Mr Bautista's evening as the Brooklyn Nets lost to the New York Knicks, 109-98.  

Success: Mr Bautista blew the crowd away with his performance of the national anthem and the clip is spreading quickly on YouTube
