Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola faces a touchline ban after an altercation with a female fourth official on Sunday.

As his side struggled to a 0-0 draw against Borussia Monchengladbach, Guardiola became increasingly agitated. His frustration boiled over when Gladbach's Granit Xhaka sustained an injury in stoppage time, delaying the game for over a minute.

Guardiola clearly feared that his side would be denied the full three minutes they had been granted to score – or concede – a winner, and immediately began to talk heatedly with fourth official Bibiana Steinhaus.

Steinhaus, a policewoman from Hamburg and well-respected matchday official in the Bundesliga and Germany's second tier, rebuffed his complaints, prompting Guardiola to storm away, clapping sarcastically.

The Catalan quickly had second thoughts, returning to Steinhaus and placing an arm around her. The 35 year old shrugged him off sternly, and continued to watch the game.

As it is an offence to make physical contact with any official, Guardiola may now face a ban. Though the officials declined to send him to the stands immediately, he could be punished retroactively by the DFB football court.

Even if he isn't punished, the Bayern coach has made few friends with his touchline antics this weekend. 

Social media was immediately awash with people claiming the Catalan was showing 'his true face', and on a Sky Sports discussion show afterwards, Guardiola was accused of being patronising.

'It showed a lack of respect, the way he behaved towards Bibiana,' said former manager Ewald Lienen, 'it almost looked like he was asking her on a date. The way she shook him off was brilliant.'

Guardiola himself justified his actions by explaining that Steinhaus had informed him there would be no more time added on after Xhaka had delayed the game in injury time.

'I wanted more time, but she said "no, we are not doing that"', Guardiola said later.

As it turned out, Bayern did get their chance, with the game only finishing after 96 minutes. It made no difference, though, as Gladbach held to complete a well earned draw.
