Contaminated beer served at a funeral has killed 56 people in Mozambique.

Another 49 people were admitted to hospital and 149 treated for the poisoning in the Chitima and Songo districts in the northeastern Tete province.

The guests taken ill had drunk Pombe, a traditional Mozambican beer, made from millet or corn flour.

Authorities believe that the drink was poisoned with crocodile bile during the course of the funeral

Authorities believe that the drink was poisoned with crocodile bile during the course of the funeral.

Blood and beer samples were being sent to the capital Maputo to be tested, said provincial health director Carle Mosse.

“We don’t have the capacity to test the samples,” she told Radio Mozambique.

Mourners who drank the beer in the morning reported no illness, while those who drank the beer in the afternoon, fell ill, authorities said.

They believe the beer must have been poisoned while funeral goers were at the cemetery.

The woman who brewed the beer is also among the dead. 

Police are investigating the incident. Health authorities have begun collecting food parcels and other items for donation to the affected families.

Blood and beer samples were being sent to the capital Maputo, above, to be tested, said provincial health director Carle Mosse.
