A morbidly obese man has been awarded £240,000 in damages from his GP because the doctor failed to refer him to a weight loss clinic or arrange a gastric band surgery.

Luis Almario is suffering from terminal liver cancer, weighs more than 300lbs for his 5ft 6in frame, and blames his doctor for his condition.

The 68-year-old Australian was already suffering from liver disease when he began seeing Dr Emmanuel Varipatis in 1997, an illness which progressed into cirrhosis, liver failure and eventually liver cancer.

Fatal obesity: Luis Almario has won £240,000 in compensation from his GP as the Australian court ruled the doctor was to blame for Mr Almario's terminal cancer

Colombian-born Mr Almario saw Dr Varipatis for 14 years during which time, a court found, the doctor failed to ensure that the illness did not regress.

Although the court reduced Mr Almario's damages from £374,648 to £239,774 due to mitigating factors, including his diet, Justice Joseph Campbell said had it not been for the ‘negligence’ of Dr Varipatis the outcome would have been different.

Mr Almario has been given 40 weeks to live as a result of the advanced liver cancer brought on by his obesity, the Sydney Morning Herald reports,

‘I am satisfied that but for the negligence of the defendant, the liver disease would not have progressed to cirrhosis.

'One could have expected a great improvement in his health generally, had bariatric surgery been successful, and a healthful weight been achieved by Mr Almario following surgery,’ said Justice Joseph Campbell in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

Blame: Mr Almario says his life could have been saved had his GP ensured he lost weight, preventing his cancer

Justice Joseph Campbell found Dr Varipatis negligent on three counts but the Sydney GP has appealed the decision.

He insists that when he began treating obese Mr Almario in 1997, gastric band surgery was not considered an effective treatment for liver disease linked to morbid obesity.

The case has been deemed a legal landmark by medical experts, who have raised concerns about the effect it will have on doctor’s responsibility for their patients’ weight.

‘This will force doctors to refer patients off for every test under the sun or fear being dragged into the courtroom,’ Dr Adrian Sheen, from Doctor's Action, told Fairfax Media.

‘The cost to the health service will be astronomical.’
