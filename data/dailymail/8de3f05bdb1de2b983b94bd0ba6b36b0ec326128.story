A hit-and-run driver who killed a man when he smashed his $300,000 Ferrari into theirs at 100mph has been arrested more than a year after the crash.

Radomin Delgado ploughed his red F430 Scuderia into the rear end of a Hyundai Sonata being driven by Jorge Arrojas, 60, and his partner of 40 years Miguel Larrieu on August 10 last year.

The crash flung the couple's car into a vehicle ahead of them and onto the median strip of the Florida highway.

Love: Miguel Larrieu (left) and Jorge Arrojas (right) were childhood friends and partners from the age of 20

Retired postal worker Mr Arrojas, behind the wheel, was killed and Mr Larrieu severely injured.

The Ferrari was found totalled on the side of the road but its driver had fled - either on foot or in another car.

Last night, Florida Highway Patrol tracked down race car driver Delgado and charged him with leaving the scene of a death.

Officers had named Delgado as a 'person of interest' days after the crash, but the investigation tying him to the scene has taken months.

Killed: Retired postal worker Mr Arrojas, 60, was pronounced dead at the scene on August 10 last year

He was finally identified as the key suspect this month by a detective team by using cell phone records, DNA evidence, and watching YouTube videos that show Delgado driving his F430 in professional races, according to CBS Miami.  

The couple had been returning from to Southwest Ranches after a late dinner in Bal Harbour.

But as they came on to the highway from a side road, Delgado's Ferrari smashed into the back of their 2012 Hyundai. 

It was sent tumbling through the air and over the guardrail, end over end, until coming to a rest with Mr Arrojas slumped over, his head on Mr Larrieu’s chest. 

Mr Larrieu frantically tried to wake his childhood friend, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Charged: Police named Delgado (pictured) as a person of interest last year but could not link him to the case

Evidence: Police watched this video, tracked phone records and used DNA evidence to tie him to the case

'In 10 seconds, my life as it was came to an end,’ he told the Sun-Sentinal days later.

'Jorge had his head on top of my chest and I kept asking him to breathe but it was over because I couldn't see him breathe,' Larrieu told CBS.

'Thank God there were some people who stopped to help and called an ambulance, but the person who did this didn't even worry if we were alive or dead.'  

Mr Larrieu's lawyer told CBS he settled a civil case against Delgado earlier this year.
