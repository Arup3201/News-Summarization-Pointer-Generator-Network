A California woman who lied to her boyfriend about being pregnant concocted a sinister plot to kidnap two babies and pass them off as her own — a scheme that ended with the murder of a 3-week-old girl, police revealed today.

Giseleangelique Rene D'Milian, 47, of Thousand Oaks, followed a young mother she saw boarding a bus in Long Beach with the baby girl and later tried to have an acquaintance killed in a botched attempt to steal her son, authorities said Wednesday.

D'Milian and Anthony McCall, 29, of Vista, were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy. 

Todd Boudreaux, 44, of Fontana, and D'Milian's daughter Charisse Shelton, 30, of Corona, were arrested on suspicion of being accessories after the fact.

Ignoble resting place: Baby Eliza was discovered inside a trash container in Imperial City, California, January 4, after her kidnapper snatched her from her parents' home and shot her mother and uncle

The suspects were expected to make their first court appearance Friday. It wasn't clear whether they had retained attorneys yet or would request a public defender.

'In my notes, I had the word "evil" several times, and my staff told me to take it out but I can't summarize it any other way,' Police Chief Robert Luna said at an afternoon news conference.

'We intend to get a full prosecution and I hope that they .get hammered for this,'he said. 'This is just unbelievable.'

The plot began when D'Milian, a self-styled 'mediation expert' and 'business coach,' falsely told her married boyfriend that she had given birth to his twins, a boy and girl, last December while she was out of the country, Luna said.

'In order to continue with this deception, she needed to produce two children who matched the ages of her fabricated twins,' the chief said.

The first effort January 3 had D'Milian and McCall using separate cars to follow the mother of a young girl who boarded a public bus in Long Beach, Luna said.

When the woman got off the bus and began to walk home, D'Milian stopped her Range Rover and briefly talked to the woman about her child, Luna said.

Less than two hours later, McCall snatched little Eliza Delacruz from her home, shooting and seriously wounding her parents and uncle, Luna said.

The next day, the baby was found dead in a dumpster in Imperial Beach, a city near the Mexican border and about 100 miles south of the girl's home.

'The reason baby Eliza was killed remains unknown,' Luna said. He didn't release the cause of her death.

The next month, D'Milian arranged to find another baby by claiming she had a charitable organization that wanted to help young mothers and contacting her friends and acquaintances, El Segundo Police Chief Mitch Tavera said.

On the morning of February 6, she targeted an acquaintance who had a 4-month-old boy, arranging for McCall to kill the woman and take the child from an El Segundo hotel in the 2000 block of East Mariposa Avenue, Tavera said.

McCall allegedly savagely beat the woman with a baseball bat, but fled without the baby after hotel workers knocked on the door and the woman yelled for help, the El Segundo police chief said.

Clues: Theses sketches released last week show the woman and man that were sought in connection to the abduction of Eliza Delacruz

'She was starting over. This was a new kidnap attempt for them,' said Long Beach Lt. Lloyd Cox said of D'Milian.

Long Beach police were aware of the El Segundo case. But the case came together in the last week after police released sketches of two suspects and details about a black Range Rover following Eliza's mother.

Witnesses who contacted police gave investigators names that matched the suspects that El Segundo police were investigating in their case and provided the location of the SUV.

Investigators are seeking other women with babies between one and two months of age who may have been contacted by text message about D'Milian's fake charity, Luna said.
