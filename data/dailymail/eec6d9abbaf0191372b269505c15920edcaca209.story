Victim: Jamie McMahon was battered to death in a churchyard by thieves who stole from him to buy tobacco and crisps, a court heard

Thieves battered a man to death and stamped on his face so hard they left the imprint of a trainer on it just to steal £30 to buy tobacco and crisps, a court heard today.

Jamie McMahon was left for dead  lying face down in a churchyard after he was allegedly attacked at random by Michael Francis, 33, and Mark Lewis, 19.

The 26-year-old had been on his way home from playing snooker with friends when he stopped to eat a doner kebab in St Giles’ Churchyard, Northampton, only to be violently attacked.

A jury at Northampton Crown Court heard how Mr McMahon was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' when he was approached by Francis and Lewis who were 'on a mission to steal and rob' in the early hours of October 2 last year.

The snooker-hall worker was left with 
horrific head and facial injuries after being stamped on so hard they 
left behind the imprint of a trainer, jurors were told.

His body was found lying face down on the ground by a cyclist who was passing through the graveyard at around 8am.

The jury was told how Francis and Lewis, who deny murdering Mr McMahon, stole £20 from his pocket and his iPhone, which they went on to sell for just £10.

Yvonne Coen, prosecuting, said they went to the church looking for 'easy pickings' as there were no CCTV cameras and people were often 'worse for wear'.

'The two defendants walked more than two miles into town with the intention of robbing someone,' she said.

'They set upon Mr McMahon and kicked him while he was on the floor.

'Jamie was left for dead, face down in the churchyard.

'The spoils they stole from him were £30. This was £20 in cash and the £10 they received for selling his iPhone.

'Jamie McMahon was killed for that.'

The court heard that CCTV cameras tracked the pair on their walk home and they stopped at a BP garage.

There they used £12.39 of the stolen cash to buy tobacco, soft drink, jam sandwiches, crisps, milk and sugar.

Mr McMahon suffered a number of injuries to his face as a result of the attack including cuts, deep bruising and a fractured eye socket.

A pathologist concluded that the head injuries would have left him unconscious and he would have died within an hour of the attack.

Giving evidence, Gary Knight, a friend and work colleague said Mr McMahon took part in a snooker match in the evening before his death and seemed his normal 'bubbly, bouncy' self.

Mr Knight said his friend Mr McMahon left Cooper’s Snooker Club when it closed shortly after midnight and they then parted when he walked towards the town centre.

'Jamie was one in a million and I feel lucky to have met him,' he said.

'He was the sort of guy that made everyone happy and he was great at one-liners.

'He was an awesome person to know.

'If there was any trouble he was the sort of person to try to calm things down. He never went looking for trouble.'

Francis and Lewis, both from Northampton, deny murder. Lewis has already pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery. Francis also denies one charge of robbery.

The trial, which is expected to last nine days, continues.
