White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest found himself in a predicament on Monday when reporters questioned him about Vice President Joe Biden's claim last Friday that Turkey and the United Arab Emirates inadvertently armed terrorist groups in Syria.

Asked if there was any truth Biden's statement, which he has since apologized for to both country's governments, Earnest hemmed and hawed and, at one point, stammered and gulped.

'The reason for the vice president's phone call was that he wanted to clarify that his recent remarks regarding the early stages of the conflict in Syria were not meant to imply that the UAE had facilitated or supported ISIL, al-Qaeda or other extremist groups in Syria,' Earnest said.

'Th -- well -- ah': That was White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's response this afternoon to a reporter's question today regarding the truth behind Vice President Joe Biden's claims about Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Friday

Pressed to state that the White House believes that the UAE did not provide weapons and money to terrorist groups as part of a plan to aid Syrian rebels opposed to their country's leader, Bashar al-Assad, Earnest gave an even less comprehensible answer.

'That is what the -- th -- well -- ah -- let me just be clear, that what the president, or what the vice president did was clarify his remarks to indicate that, um, that he was attempting to imply that the UAE had facilitated or supported ISIL, al-Qaeda or other extremist groups in Syria,' he said, awkwardly pausing and changing direction at several points in the beginning of his answer.

'The fact of the matter is, and again, the vice president noted this in his phone call with the crown prince, that the UAE continues to be a strong partner with the United States in this effort,' he continued, adding that the White House is 'proud' to be working with the Emiratis to defeat the Islamic State.

Vice President Joe Biden told what some foreign policy experts are referring to now as the cold, hard truth on Friday when he called Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Arab countries out for their role in the growth of the Islamic State in Syria while answering a question during an event at the Kennedy School of Government.

After a student asked him if he thinks the U.S. erred in it's decision not to arm moderate Syrian rebels years ago, when Obama administration officials including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta wanted to, Biden said he did not. 

In explaining his reasoning, Biden said: 'My constant cry was that our biggest problem is our allies — our allies in the region were our largest problem in Syria.'

Biden went on to say that 'the Turks were great friends,' as were the the other countries. But 'they were so determined to take down Assad and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war' that 'they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad.'

'Except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world,' Biden added.

The vice president also claimed that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an old friend of his, claimed in a private conversation that his country had in fact let 'too many' foreign fighters through.

Vice President Joe Biden told students at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that Turkey and the United Arab Emirates had a role in allowing weapons and money into Syria to bolster extremist groups fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad

Erdogan refuted Biden's claim over the weekend, saying that never happened, and the vice president was forced to apologize for mischaracterizing the foreign leader's statements. In phone calls to Turkey and the UAE leaders Biden also 'clarified' that he never meant to insinuate that their countries had purposefully armed terrorists.

But Biden never, in any way, suggested that the Middle Eastern countries had funded Islamic extremists by design, leading reporters to wonder on Monday why the White House had Biden apologize for that comment. Were they not true? 

As Politico pointed out on Monday morning, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry had said as much themselves in recent statements.

'The truth is that we’ve had state actors who at times have thought that the way to advance their interests is, well, financing some of these groups as proxies is not such a bad strategy,' Obama said during a press conference on August 28.

'And part of our message to the entire region is this should be a wake-up call to Sunni, to Shia — to everybody — that a group like ISIS is beyond the pale,' he continued.

More recently, Kerry told CNN's Christiane Ammanpour, 'In the very beginning ... when the efforts to oust Assad took place, there were people who made calculations that the important thing is to remove Assad.

'And that, unfortunately, resulted in funding to different groups, and it was frankly a sloppy process. It did not provide the coordinated, concerted effort that was needed,' the State Department official said during a Sept. 24 interview.

The difference between Biden's statement and that of Obama and Kerry was that he named names, making it clear to important allies in the fight against ISIS that the administration believes they are responsible for the state of affairs in Syria.

State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki fared slightly better than Earnest this afternoon when asked for her agency's reaction to Biden's comments. 

'We don't have any evidence of any country supporting ISIL,' she said after ducking questions about the issue for a the first couple minutes of her daily briefing.

After acknowledging that her own boss, Kerry, had made a comment similar to Biden's in the not-so-distant past, Psaki said State is 'obviously focused on moving forward, and what we can do from here.'

'There have been a number of steps that have been taken, even over the past couple of weeks, by a number of these countries to do more to crack down on foreign fighters and crack down on counter financing. 

'That's where our focus is,' she said.
