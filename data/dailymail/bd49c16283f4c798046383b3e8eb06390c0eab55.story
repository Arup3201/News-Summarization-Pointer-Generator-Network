Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is relishing playing alongside new recruit Alexis Sanchez, and says he is learning a lot from the Chile international.

Sanchez, a £30million summer signing from Barcelona, is Arsenal’s top scorer in the Premier League this season with seven goals including two in yesterday’s 3-0 win over Burnley.

And the forward’s technical ability and work rate have left an instant impression on his young English team-mate.

‘With someone who has had the experience he has had — at some of the clubs he has been at — it’s hard not to learn from him,’ Oxlade-Chamberlain said.

‘His ability on the ball is second to none and you can always pick up little things. And his defensive duties as an attacker, the work he does up front, is something I can learn from as well.’

Arsenal will be hoping the Chilean keeps up his good form as they welcome Belgian side Anderlecht in the Champions League on Tuesday, before travelling to face Swansea in their next Premier League game next Sunday.

Sanchez has been in fine form for Arsenal so far this season, scoring seven times in the Premier League
