It is not the most conventional way of breaking up protests, but Sam the skateboarding dog certainly seems to be effective.

Ukrainian police have found a secret weapon to battle demonstrations in the city of Odessa, in the form of a skateboarding British Bulldog.

The performing pup has already managed to work his magic on one group, when demonstrators descended on City Hall in Duma Square, in the south-western Ukrainian city.

The angry mob had gathered to protest against corruption in particular with relation to building permits being handed out allegedly for bribes with the angry mob waving placards and chanting.

With only three officers on security outside, it looks as if things were about to get out of hand when the mob started gathering at the door to the building and looked as if they wanted to get inside.

But the anger turned to amusement and laughter and the mob faded away when skateboarder Sam swept into the square, and started nipping through the masses on his skateboard.

Ukrainian police could certainly use the dog as an unusual method of crowd control during protests

Instantly the crowd focused attention on the dog who performed some impressive steering manoeuvres and was even able to turn the skateboard back onto its wheels every time it turned over when hitting someone.

Eyewitness Anatoly Hlushko, 25, said: 'He was hilarious and impossible to ignore, he seemed very excited about the action and was smashing the skateboard left and right and running into everyone. 

'It was also panting like a steam engine and suddenly people who seemed to focus on the building were grabbing their mobile phones to film the hilarious dog.'

One person is heard on one of the videos asking if the animal was a police dog, with another woman confirming: 'He must be. Look at the way he is rounding everybody up.'

Sam is apparently a well-known sight in the city and favourite for his clever tricks

Eventually though Sam, who is well known at least in Odessa for his skateboarding stunts at a local skate park, had enough and skateboarded off into the distance without stopping.

His owner was not in sight and it's suspected that the dog had run off from the local park with his skateboard after being attracted by the noise and excitement at the nearby Square.

Afterwards, he apparently decided to return back to his owner.
