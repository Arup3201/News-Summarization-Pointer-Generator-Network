Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia's guitar may help solve a 24-year-old homicide case of an unidentified woman dubbed the 'Tiger Lady' for the signature tattoo on her left leg. 

New Jersey State Police recently released sketches of the crude tiger tattoo in November, and immediately started receiving a flurry of tips from Deadheads who said it based a striking resemblance to a similar design on the guitar Garcia used from 1979 until 1995.

'It's indubitable a take on Jerry's guitar,' Dennis McNally, a longtime publicist for the band, told NJ.com.

The connection to the Grateful Dead provides a crucial bit of evidence in a case where investigators were left stumped by a lack of clues. And it makes sense too - the Grateful Dead played a series of concerts in the area in the weeks leading up to the mystery woman's death. 

Similar design: Jerry Garcia used the guitar with the tiger detail from 1979 until 1995 

The naked body of the Tiger Lady was found decomposing on the side of the Route 94 turnoff in New Jersey on October 26, 1991.  

Police suspected foul play in her death,  but didn't know where to turn since they could neither identify her or figure out the cause of death. 

No drugs or alcohol were found in her system after a toxicology report and there was no sign of traumatic injuries such as blunt force or bullet wounds. 

At the time, it was estimated that she died about 10 days before. But experts say the decomposition of the body could have happened over a longer period of time. 

If so, she could have died sometime between September 8 - 18, when the Grateful Dead were playing nine back to back shows at nearby Madison Square Garden. 

'The potential connection to the Grateful Dead touring in the area is something the detectives will look at,' said Sgt. Jeff Flynn, a spokesman for the New Jersey State Police. 'With social media, we can get new eyes on this case. With cold cases, you have to look at any new leads that pop up.'

At the time, the only piece of evidence on the Tiger Lady's body for police to investigate was the tattoo, and they were successful in finding the ink supplier - Spaulding and Rogers of Vooheesville, New York.

Spaulding and Rogers helped out with the investigation, sending more than 20,000 fliers to tattoo artists they supplied in hopes that someone would recognize the design and be able to identify the woman.

Now that police believe the victim was a potential Deadhead, they may have better luck since the community is close knit and have groups dedicated to aiding in these investigations.

Those within the community say Deadheads were targeted when the band was still touring, since they were generally considered to be trusting people. 

'It was assumed you were a good person, because you were a Deadhead,' McNally said. 'It was certainly an ideal environment if some twisted individual wanted to prey on people. This was an audience almost uniquely susceptible.We had some horrible things happen.'

One Deadhead also pointed out a detail of the homicide that could further prove the woman was a fan of the band.

'It would make sense that she was found as naked as she was,' added Cunha. 'The people that she would have been with would have known she would be identified from the tie-dye, the jewelry.'
