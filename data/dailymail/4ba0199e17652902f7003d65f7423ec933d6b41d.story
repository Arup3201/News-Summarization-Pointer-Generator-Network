The latest addition to the Dragons' Den panel has been involved with 32 firms that have folded, according to reports.

Internet and technology entrepreneur Piers Linney, 42, is the joint chief executive of technology firm Outsourcery and joined the Dragons earlier this month.

But documents at Companies House show that two of the firms he was previously involved with folded with six-figure debts.

New Dragon Piers Linney is the joint chief executive of cloud computing firm Outsourcery, but has been involved with 32 firms that have folded

Mr Linney was announced as the newest Dragon this month and has previously appeared on Channel 4's The Secret Millionaire

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'The Dragons are ruthless and tough-talking on screen so viewers might be surprised that not everything they touched has turned to gold.'

One firm, Itchy Media Ltd, owed £565,000 when it was wound up while Interactive Media Developments Ltd was liquidated five years ago owing £462,000.

Mr Linney, who is a former investment banker and a qualified solicitor, is also known to television viewers through his appearance on Channel 4's The Secret Millionaire.

He worked with prisoners in a young offenders' institution on the show and went on to employ one of them at Outsourcery.

Part of Outsourcery, a successful cloud computing service provider, was sold in 2010 for £12million.

He was announced as the replacement for businessman Theo Paphitis, who quit the panel last month after nine years on the show.

Interior
designer Kelly Hoppen took haulage firm boss Hilary Devey's seat on the
show after Ms Devey decided to leave the BBC for Channel 4 last year.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Piers is from 
an industry that's never been represented in the Den before and offers a
different perspective on growing a business in a challenging economy.

Mr Linney and interior designer Kelly Hoppen will replace Hilary Devey, second left, and Theo Paphitis, centre, on the Dragons' Den panel alongside Duncan Bannatyne, left, Deborah Meaden, second right, and Peter Jones, right

'Piers has been a professional and private investor supporting UK entrepreneurs and has been involved in many investments across a range of sectors some of which he has developed into multi million pound businesses and sold. 

'Since 2007 Piers has focused on Outsourcery, which he has built into a successful business creating hundreds of jobs in a recession.'

MailOnline has approached Mr Linney for comment through Outsourcery.
