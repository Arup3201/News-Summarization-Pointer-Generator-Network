Judging by her big grin in the photo she posted on Twitter on Monday, Victoria Beckham is pretty happy - and she has reason to be. The designer has just launched her Autumn/Winter 2013 collection for Victoria, Victoria Beckham online. 

With sharp lines and silhouettes, the clothes have a recognisable edge to them, but gone is the slinky femininity of previous efforts; this collection is far more masculine and subdued.

Gone is the slinky femininity of previous efforts; this collection is far more masculine and subdued

It's a new aesthetic that shows Victoria's earlier incarnations (remember Posh Spice's exuberant style?) are far from mind. She recently admitted as much. At the catwalk presentation back in February she said: ‘I feel like the Victoria, Victoria Beckham girl this season is an engaged intellectual with a sense of humour.'

'She can wear anything with aplomb yet she chooses the simplicity of a dress. She marches rather than walks, she drinks espresso, and she devours books and art and film. And she is subversively sexy without trying. I’d like to meet her…’

This girl goes for structured shifts and tunics. Her colour palette includes burgundy tones, rosy copper and navy blue. She likes a splash of sparkle; she won't say no to the occasional swathe of sequins.

What's more, the VVB girl wears sensible boots and midi-heels and for the woman who is never seen out of her towering heels, this is truly a radical departure for Victoria. 

Drop-waists are still a key styling feature

Colours are more masculine and muted

Victoria, pictured here following one of her catwalk shows in New York in February, has said of the VVB girl: 'She can wear anything with aplomb yet she chooses the simplicity of a dress. She marches rather than walks, she drinks espresso, and she devours books and art and film. And she is subversively sexy without trying.'

Speaking to Vogue earlier this year at her VVB Autumn/Winter 2013 show, the designer said, 'I'm really excited about this collection, it's effortlessly cool and easy and we've developed a lot of textures, it looks like there's a lot of layers,' she explained.

'The idea is that you don't have to think about it. It looks like two pieces - jumpers and skirts - but it's just one piece and you can just zip yourself up and off you go.'

This no-fuss attitude isn't just sophisticated, it's pragmatic - perfect for busy women like Victoria, the ultimate VVB girl.

Mega-watt smile: Victoria recently went on a hike in Los Angeles wearing sandals .. is this a sign the love affair with heels is over?
