Spain goalkeeper David de Gea has a leg injury and could be out for the rest of the World Cup group stage.

The Manchester United goalie underwent medical scans on Sunday that revealed a leg muscle strain, with the defending champions listing him as day-to-day.

Spanish media reports suggest De Gea will be sidelined for up to 10 days, ruling him out of the final two Group B matches against Chile and Australia. De Gea recently made his debut for Spain.

Captain and regular goalkeeper Iker Casillas' poor play in Friday's 5-1 loss to the Netherlands had given De Gea a possible chance to take over the starting role.

Pepe Reina is the only other goalie available to the world and European champions going into Wednesday's must-win game against Chile at the Maracana.
