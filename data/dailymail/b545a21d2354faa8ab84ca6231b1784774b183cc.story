England No 8 Ben Morgan is set to see a specialist next week in the latest phase of his recovery from a broken leg.

Morgan underwent surgery after suffering the injury during Gloucester's Aviva Premiership victory over Saracens last Friday.

He is now destined to miss England's entire RBS 6 Nations campaign, which starts against Wales in Cardiff on February 6.

But the World Cup on English soil later this year will remain a target for a player who shone for England during this season's autumn campaign.

'Surgery went well and was successful, and we will look at getting him in to see the specialist next Tuesday, so we will have a better idea then,' Gloucester rugby director David Humphreys said on Thursday.

'But, so far, the reports have been encouraging.

'The mental part is probably harder than the physical part. We all know that, in the game we play, one of the inevitable consequences for any player is that he will be injured.

Although Morgan has been ruled out of the Six Nations, he is hopeful of returning for the World Cup

'I am sure it will be difficult for him to sit at home and watch the Six Nations, but he has a huge goal in front of him, which is the World Cup and preparing himself to be fit for that.

'I am not sure of the detail of the operation, and I think, at this stage, he has been given the best opportunity to get back fit as soon as possible.'

England head coach Stuart Lancaster will name his squad ahead of the Six Nations next Wednesday, with Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola favourite to start against Wales.
