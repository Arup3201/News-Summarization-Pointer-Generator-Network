Caught on tape is the shocking moment a crane snapped atop a 65-story luxury building in New York after high storm winds left it dangling precariously over the city.

The construction crane was left hanging over the edge of a building on West 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, while nearby streets and buildings were cleared as a precaution.

The crane can be seen standing erect before the high winds force it to lurch over, snapping it in the process, leaving it swinging over the streets below.

Evacuation: The collapsed crane dangles beside a building under construction as Hurricane Sandy makes its approach

Record: Once completed, the building will be the tallest residential building in the city

The fire department reported that it had
 responded to a multiple-dwelling building collapse at Eight Avenue and 
14th Street.

People were reportedly trapped inside the structure, but additional information about the 7pm 
accident is not yet known.

The call over the crane collapse came in around 2.30pm yesterday as conditions worsened and Hurricane Sandy approached.

Meteorologists said winds atop the building could have been close to 95mph at the time.

New York City evacuated neighbors of the 
nearly completed luxury apartment building after the collapse prompted fears 
the crane's boom could crash to the ground.

The buildings that were evacuated included the Parker 
Meridien hotel with 900 guests.

The crane's upper arm dangled over the 
street near Central Park from what should eventually become the city's 
tallest residential building.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the crane 
had been inspected on Friday, as other construction cranes had ahead of 
the storm, and that the cause of the accident remained unknown.

High risk: A large part of the problem was the fact that the malfunction occurred at such a high point

Evacuation: The buildings near the crane, including a major hotel, were all evacuated in case the crane falls to the ground

Engineers went to the top of the building to examine the crane but stopped short of attempting any repairs, officials said.

The New York City Buildings Department suspended construction work at 5pm Saturday in anticipation of the storm.

The government body reminded contractors and property owners to secure construction sites and buildings.

It was also performing random inspections to make sure equipment was secured.

Mayor Bloomberg told a news conference: 'It's conceivable that nobody did 
anything wrong whatsoever and it wasn't even a malfunction, it was just a
 strange gust of wind.

'Just because it was inspected, that 
doesn't mean that God doesn't do things or that metal doesn't fail. 
There's no reason to think at this point in time that the inspection 
wasn't adequate.'

Firefighters closed streets for 
several blocks surrounding the site, evacuated 300 apartments in three 
buildings and were preparing to evacuate more, a Fire Department 
spokesman said.

Sheared off: The face of an apartment building in the West Village collapsed, leaving the inside of the apartments exposed to the elements

Major incident: Dozens of fire trucks lined up over the reported collapse that displaced 25 people

Before: This is what the building looked like prior to its face falling off and collapsing onto the street

A spokeswoman for Lend Lease, construction manager for the project, said the company was working with city officials to secure the structure but the weather remained severe.

Passers-by stared in apprehension, while some stopped to take pictures of the building that 
will feature $90million duplexes.

'It's fascinating, I saw it on TV and
 came out to see it. But it's also scary. If it happened there, who 
knows where else it could happen,' said Sam O'Keeffe, 25, a bartender 
who lives in the neighborhood.

Dangerous: Billionaire Donald Trump posted this photo of the building as seen from his apartment window in Trump Tower, several avenues east of the site

Dangling: A portion of the crane collapsed in the high wind because it was not secured properly

Keeping watch: Police look up from the street level as emergency teams worked for a solution

Stumped: Hours after the problem was reported, it still had not been fixed

Increasing winds: A solution will be even more difficult to come by as winds are only expected to increase overnight and into Tuesday

Grave danger: Firefighters gaze at the damaged crane as it hangs from its base following the high winds and pouring rain

Shannon Kaye, 96, lives in the building next door.

'We heard a noise, but we didn't know what it was,' she said. Minutes later, she and her neighbors were told to leave.

'I never liked that building, looking down into my bedroom,' she said. 'I always had the feeling that something would come falling down from it.'

The latest police reports state that 
fire department officials are currently responding to a call that a 
crane at the One World Trade Center site has broken.

The
 World Trade Center is at the bottom end of Manhattan, in the area that 
Mayor Bloomberg ordered a forced evacuation in preparation for 
the storm.

The first fallen crane, at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, is significantly further uptown.

One57, New York's tallest residential building-to-be, has been under construction since 2009 and is set to open in 2013.

The New York Times recently called the 
building a 'global billionaires' club' because the nine full-floor 
apartments near the top have all been sold to billionaires.

Opulent: One57 will be New York's tallest residential once it opens in 2013

Luxury: The building, located at 157 West 57th Street in Manhattan, is currently under construction and was designed by French architect Christian de Portzamparc

Full-floor apartments start at floor 
77, with the Park Hyatt Hotel at the base, and the starting price for a 
space in the tower is reportedly $45m.

The tower, designed by French 
architect Christian de Portzamparc, will offer luxury amenities like a 
full service spa, a screening room, private dining room, a full spa and 
even a pet wash room.

Ninety-two luxury condominiums will sit atop a five-star Park Hyatt hotel.

Two of those units were under contract for more than $90m each, 
The New York Times reported last month, citing the president of building
 developer, Extell Development Company.

Extell, which did not respond to requests for comment on Monday, 
announced in May it had reached $1bn in sales and that half of its
 units had sold in six months. Occupancy was set for 2013.

High end: The units at the Manhattan tower reportedly start at $45 million

Stunning: The building overlooks Central Park and comes with a slew of amenities including an indoor pool, a screening room, a pet-wash room, an arts atelier and a full service spa

The contractor was Australia's Lend 
Lease Construction and Canada's Pinnacle Industries own the crane, said 
Mary Costello, a spokeswoman for Lend Lease.

'We are working with structural engineers and the DOB (Department of 
Buildings) on evaluating any additional measures that can be taken to 
secure the boom and crane structure,' Costello said.

The billionaires behind fashion label Michael Kors, Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, have both signed contracts for $50 million full-floor apartments in the tower at 157 W. 57th Street.

A sprawling 13,554 square foot apartment on the 75th and 76th floor on 
the building, reportedly sold for $90m to an unknown buyer and the penthouse of One57, located on the 89th and 90th floors, was rumored to have sold for $95m.
