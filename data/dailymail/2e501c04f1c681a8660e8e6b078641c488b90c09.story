As the New Year rolled in, so did a number of key legislation changes in the areas of health, welfare, immigration and even the environment. 

From January 1, new Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders will be subject to a far stricter income test which from now on will include assessments of non-taxable superannuation income.

This means that the card, which provides holders with discounts for services including medical expenses and public transport, will be far more difficult to obtain for many.

From January 1, new Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders will be subject to a far stricter income test while recipients of the Disability Support Pension will be forced to take shorter holidays or risk having their payments cancelled 

The Disability Support Pension will also be affected by legislation changes in 2015, with the government announcing that recipients will have their payments cancelled if they travel overseas for longer than four weeks – a reduction from the previous six week law.

They will also now require assessment by a government doctor rather than their own GP's, in order to be eligible for the benefit, SBS reports. 

New Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance recipients under the age of 30, will have to wait between one and six months to receive their payment under new laws.

If they miss an appointment with their employer without a good excuse, the government will suspend their payments until the appointment is rescheduled.

From December 31, solariums across NSW were forced to close or cancel their tanning services or risk a fine of up to $44,000, while Queensland made the change from New Year's Day.

The Cancer Council website states: 'A recent review of the research on the link between skin cancer and solarium use found that the risk of skin cancer from any use of a solarium was 20 per cent. This rose to 59 per cent for people who used solariums before 35 years of age.'

Love birds who want to bring their foreign partner into the country to work or live will have to pay up to $6865 to do so, under new laws in the coming year. This is an increase of over $2000 that is likely to bring the government over $373 million in revenue, Fairfax reports. 

The environment, at least, will be better protected under new laws that will see smoking banned in all NSW national parks from next year.

The state national parks website states the ban will reduce the risk of accidental bushfires and littering and will apply: 'to picnic areas, campgrounds, accommodations, beaches, lookouts, walking tracks, and on national park roads'.

Any corporation that fails to comply with the environmental authority regarding a contamination order in the new year, will be fined $1 million instead of the former $137,500 fee.

In Western Australia, people who bite or spit at police officers will undergo a mandatory blood test from Thursday.

Officers previously had to wait up to six months for their own test results if they were suspected of having contracted an infectious disease in the line of duty.

Under the new laws a person suspected of having transferred bodily fluids such as semen, blood and saliva, to an officer will have their blood tested for infectious diseases and those who fail will be fined $12,000 or serve 12 months in jail.

This year, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act has also been strengthened, with stronger penalties in place.

'Athletes and other persons must not work with coaches, trainers, doctors or others who are ineligible because of an anti-doping rule violation or who have been criminally convicted or professionally disciplined in relation to doping,' one section of the new regulations state.
