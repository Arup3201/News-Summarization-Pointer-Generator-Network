A young man who suffered a horrific brain injury will embark on an incredible charity bike ride as a moving memorial for his friend, Kim Hunt, who was killed in a tragic murder-suicide.

Ms Hunt; a beloved intensive care nurse, wife and mother, was found dead in September last year as a result of a suspected murder-suicide.

Her husband Geoff and their three young children Fletcher, Mia and Phoebe were also tragically found dead on their country property, all with gunshot wounds.

Mrs Hunt suffered from a traumatic brain injury after a car crash in 2012. Just weeks beforehand and mere kilometres away, fellow Lockhart resident Luke Stojanovic sustained very similar injuries after a bike accident.

Stojanovic, 22, is now preparing to ride to honour Mrs Hunt and to raise money for the Liverpool Brain Trauma Unit and Wagga Base Hospital Intensive Care Unit.

The hospitals were vital in helping both himself and Mrs Hunt recover from their traumatic brain injuries and is also the place where their friendship was formed. 

The road ride has long been a dream for the 22-year-old and he had often discussed his plans with Ms Hunt.

‘Kim had indicated that she would like to support Luke by riding part of the way with him,’ family friend and the fundraiser organiser, Mandy Strong told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We say to him “Kim is there with you, she’s just sitting on your shoulder keeping you going.’

Stojanovic will ride a staggering 180 kilometres on his charity ride.

He will set off from Ramsay Private Hospital in Nowra, where he is currently undergoing rehabilitation as an outpatient, and finish in Liverpool where he spent nine months after his accident.

He hopes to raise money to help brain injury sufferers along the way.

‘I am calling my ride the Luke Stono’s “Never Give up Ride”,’ said Mr Stojanovic.

‘I want to undertake this fundraising event to help others like myself so they can better themselves and be the best they can be.’

He hopes to complete the ride in 10 days from April 22 to May 1. 

'I will do this by riding a recumbent push bike that has been specially modified to suit my disability,’ explained Stojanovic.

The driven 22-year-old is focussed on using the event to commemorate the wonderful Hunt family.

He and the Lockhart community want people everywhere to learn about what Kim achieved as a nurse, a brain injury sufferer and as a friend.

Stojanovic also hopes the ride will send a message of hope to other people with brain injuries, as evidence of what they are capable of achieving. 

The pair, both residents a small town in the NSW Riverina named Lockhart, formed a close bond as they both fought to recover from their brain trauma.

‘Both accidents were really similar, just weeks and kilometres apart from each other,’ said Jackson Strong, Luke’s lifelong best friend and a renowned motocross star. 

The road ride has long been a dream for the 22-year-old and he had often discussed his plans with Ms Hunt. She had promised to ride part of the way with Luke to support him

On June 20, 2012 Stojanovic, then a 20-year-old up-and-coming motocross rider, missed a seat grab and landed on his head whilst training for motor cross stunt riding.

Shortly afterwards, on July 14, Ms Hunt suffered life-threatening injuries when she flipped her car twice while on the road leading to her Lockhart home.

Her then-four year old daughter Phoebe was also in the vehicle and suffered minor injuries

The two Lockhart residents met and formed a tight bond at the very beginning of their long road to recovery.

‘Luke and the Hunt family made a connection in hospital and that never ended. 

'Whenever Luke came to Lockhart, Kim and the Hunt family would always make sure they all came up to spend time with him,’ Mr Strong told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Stojanovic is motivated to raise money to improve the resources at the two hospitals to help provide care for other people who are suffering.

‘Throughout my days in Liverpool Hospital I was able to meet others of all ages with different degrees of brain injuries, who were fighting their own battles and who in return were inspirational people to me,’ said Mr Stojanovic.

‘After spending so much time in the Rehab Unit, I realised that these people, and the Brain Injury Unit overall, would benefit from new equipment and a total make over.’

Kim and Luke gave each other a lot of strength and lifted each other with their friendship.

Mr Stojanovic has made incredible progress thanks to his determined efforts to recover from his injury. He is pictured with his friends shortly after the accident in June 2012

Mandy and Jackson Strong are organising the Lockhart bike ride and say the community will do anything to keep the memory of the Hunt family alive

‘They went through the same hospital circuits and the families became quite close. They maintained a connection,’ agreed Mr Strong.

‘Going through the same thing with a brain injury, it was so good for them to be able to talk with each other.’

‘Kim recovered more quickly than Luke so she was also inspirational for him, motivating him by showing him what he is capable of achieving.’

The bike ride is an important step for Luke and the rest of the community who mourn the deaths of the treasured Hunt family.

‘When the tragedy happened it hit Luke pretty hard and he wants to do everything he can to keep their memory alive,' said Mr Strong.

‘I think everyone in the community feels the same and they will do whatever they can.’

‘The whole ride is about what an amazing person Kim was, the recovery she had and keeping awareness alive for people in the same situation.

‘Kim and Luke’s lives show people that they can make something positive out of it.’

Before Stojanovic embarks on his ride, the Lockhart community will come together and hold ‘The Kim Hunt and Family Memorial Ride’ to raise funds for two intensive care units and show their support

Stojanovic has worked tirelessly to recover from his brain injury, spending hours a day on the bike at the gym at his rehab centre.

‘Luke rides a specially remodelled bike. He does a lot of training and goes for rides. He does up to 60 kilometres a day, depending on his fitness.’

‘I’ll be riding next to him but probably only go be able to go half as far as Luke will. He’s pretty fit!,’ said Mr Strong.

Before Stojanovic embarks on his ride, the Lockhart community will come together and hold ‘The Kim Hunt and Family Memorial Ride’ to raise funds for two intensive care units and show their support.

Members of the community will ride 93 kilometres from Wagga to Lockhart on March 7.

‘I am extremely lucky to have the love and support of all my family, friends and our local community,' said Mr Stojanovic. 'Also for dedicated nurses, doctors, rehab physiotherapists and everyone who is helping me with my recovery'

Kim and Luke formed a close friendship during their recovery. Whenever Luke came home to Lockhart Kim, her husband Geoff and their three young children (L to R) Phoebe, Fletcher and Mia would always visit

People are encouraged to take part in the day in whatever way they can, whether it be riding part of the way by joining in at Mangoplan and The Rock, joining in for a barbeque at Lockhart Swimming Pool.

Mrs Strong is campaigning for people to donate online to help raise funds for the intensive care units that made such a difference to Mr Stojanovic and Mrs Hunt’s lives.

It is also fitting as Mrs Hunt had been a dedicated and caring nurse who spent so much time helping those in need at both Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and Lockhart District Hospital.

‘I am extremely lucky to have the love and support of all my family, friends and our local community.

'Also, for the dedicated nurses, doctors, rehab physiotherapists and everyone who is helping me with my recovery,’ said Mr Stojanovic.

The response from the community has been astounding according to Mrs Strong.

‘It’s what small towns do best. They look after each other and help each other through.’
