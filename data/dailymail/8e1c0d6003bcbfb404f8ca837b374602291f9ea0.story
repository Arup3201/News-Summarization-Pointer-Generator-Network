Shirley Temple was the personification of innocence as the curly-haired and dimpled star of movies like 'Heidi', but as a grown-up mother she faced much darker realities.

Following Temple's death at the age of 85 on February 10, a source has revealed how the former child-star saved her daughter from drug addition.

Lori Black, who was Temple's daughter with second husband Charles Black, got hooked on heroin after entering the punk rock scene of the late 80s.

When the child star became a mom: Shirley Temple, America's first child star (pictured in the 1930s on the right), died on February 10 from natural causes (On the left in 2006). A source recently told the National Enquirer about how Temple saved her daughter from an early grave after Lori Black got addicted to heroin

'Lori had a difficult relationship with her mother growing up,' a source told the National Enquirer. 'But when the chips were down, Shirley helped put Lori in rehab and supported her recovery wholeheartedly. She saved her daughter's life!'

Apparently Black was hospitalized twice for drug abuse but struggled staying clean.

She started out playing in San Francisco punk band Crown Alley, but in 1993 became the bassist for The Melvins after dating guitarist Buzz Osborne.

It was while traveling with The Melvins in February 1993 that Lori, nicknamed 'Lorax', was busted for drug possession at the airport in Portland, Oregon.

The following December, when she was 39, Black pleaded guilty to one count of possessing heroin and a second count was dropped when she agreed to two years probation, 120 hours of community service and to pay a fine of $385.

The sentence also required she attend drug therapy sessions three times a week and submit to random drug screenings.

In a show of mercy, the court let her enter rehab in northern California, where her parents lived and mother Shirley visited all the time.

The source said Temple blamed herself for her daughter's downfall, even though it 'wasn't really her fault'.

Temple even had the whole family go through therapy together so Lori wouldn't have to do it alone.

While there was a rumor Lori died of a heroin overdose in 1998, records show she is alive and well living in San Francisco and working as a photographer after getting sober with her mom's help. She is now 59.

'For Shirley, helping Lori beat her heroin addiction was the most important thing ever,' the source said.
