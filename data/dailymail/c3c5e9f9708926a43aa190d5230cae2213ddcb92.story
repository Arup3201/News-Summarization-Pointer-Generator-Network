The father of a man accused of murdering his girlfriend has admitted paranoia led him to believe a letter he found could have been his son's confession.

Leigh Turner, 54, told a jury that he did not read the note from his son Elliot to his mother Anita and he had ripped it up.

He said that all he saw was 'Dear Mum' in his son’s handwriting and he had 'paranoid thoughts of what had happened' so he destroyed it.

On trial: Elliot Turner is charged with the murder of girlfriend Emily Longley

Accused: Leigh Turner, 53, and his wife Anita are charged with obstructing the course of justice

He and his wife Anita, 51, both deny perverting the course of justice.

Elliot Turner, 20, denies the murder 
of aspiring model Emily Longley, 17, in his bedroom at the family home 
in Bournemouth, Dorset.

The prosecution at Winchester Crown 
Court allege that Turner 'went absolutely nuts' and strangled the 
teenager in a jealous rage on May 7 last year after he feared she was 
seeing other men.

He had threatened to kill her and had assaulted her when they argued during the short volatile relationship.

He said she attacked him and he 
grabbed her by the throat for five or six seconds to defend himself and 
had gone to bed and woke up to find her dead.

Today Elliot Turner pleaded guilty to 
the charge of perverting the course of justice by persuading his mother 
to change her story after the count was amended to take away reference 
to the fact he failed to call an ambulance.

Leigh Turner told the jury that he had returned home after a call from his wife that Emily 'might be dead.'

'She looked like she was asleep for 
that split second,' he explained.

'I knelt down beside her touched her 
cheek, touched her head and touched the side of her neck. She was cold -
ice cold, like a crystal cold. The girl had passed away.

'I said ‘sorry butterfly’ or something
like that, I’m crying. Then in a split second Anita was on the phone 
and I said, ‘call an ambulance.'

He said that his son had packed a suitcase and he had said to him: 'What are you going for. There is nothing to run from.'

Leigh Turner told the court he had 
found the letter in some papers at the house when the family had been 
allowed to return four days after Emily’s death.

Investigation: Emily was found dead at Elliot Turner's £300,000 family home

He said it was in a plain envelope with no writing on and he had taken it into the garden and he destroyed it.

'I just thought the worse.. I didn’t 
know what it was. It might have said Elliot might have had some 
involvement, or something written down that might have happened that 
night.

'I cannot think what I thought - it was an entity, a void. I felt numb.'

He later said he had learnt a little 
of what was in the note when he overheard his wife and son talking about
a mallet, an argument and being hit.

He said there was no excuse for 
destroying the letter but he denied he realised he was perverting the 
course of justice when he did it.

He also denied taking a jacket from the house when it was a crime scene.

Earlier the jury heard the prosecution
allege Elliot Turner was upset over his suspicions Emily was 'twisting his 
heart.'

When arrested he had his passport in his pocket, the court heard.

He told officers at the scene: 'I 
never meant to harm her, I just defended myself.'

He then made no 
comment in police interviews.

The court heard pathologists who examined Emily’s body found injuries consistent with asphyxiation, Turner had scratches on his arm and Emily had his DNA under her fingertips.

Computers seized from the home had 
Google searches for ‘death by strangulation’ and ‘how to get out of 
being charged for murder’.

Police bugged the £350,000 family home
and recorded Turner’s parents 'fabricating evidence' and being worried 
about lying to the police.

Leigh Turner, who runs a jewellery 
shop his son works in part-time, was heard to say on the recordings: 
'Elliot f***ing strangled her.'

Anita Turner took away a coat from the scene of the death, it is also alleged.

Emily was born in Britain but her family emigrated to New Zealand when she was nine and she was raised in Auckland.

She had returned to live with her grandparents in Bournemouth, to study for a business national diploma at Brockenhurst College, Hants, and worked part-time at Top Shop in Bournemouth.

She was also signed up to a modelling agency and had appeared on the front page of a magazine in New Zealand.

The jury was also told that Turner had
received a harassment warning letter from the police in January 2008 
when he was 16 telling him not to contact an ex-girlfriend.
