Lazio president Claudio Lotito has refused to rule out a move for Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli - but insists any player who wants to join the Serie A side must respect their standards.

Both Parma and Lazio are believed to have sounded out Balotelli's agent Mino Raiola over a potential loan move, but Raiola has insisted the Italian forward wants to stay and fight for a first-team place at Anfield.

However, when asked about the possibility of Balotelli joining Lazio, Lotito refused to deny that they have made an approach for the 24-year-old.

At a recent press conference he said: 'Balotelli? There are a lot of rumours.

'When I first came here, people ran away [from Lazio], now a lot of them want to come to Lazio. Whoever wants to join us must respect our standards.'

Lazio currently lie fifth in Serie A, just two points off third-placed Napoli after 19 games.
