Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has fuelled speculation linking star striker Radamel Falcao with a move to Real Madrid by saying the Colombian he is available for selection 'for now'.

Reports in Spain on Saturday claimed Falcao is on the verge of signing for the Champions League winners on an initial £10million year-long loan.

And Jardim was anything but convincing with his response when he was asked about keeping Falcao at the principality club.

Quality: Monaco striker Radamel Falcao has been linked with a £10m year-long loan move to Real Madrid

Jardim told French paper L'Equipe: 'For now, he is a Monaco player and I am counting on him.'

Falcao, who moved to Monaco from Real's bitter rivals Atletico Madrid for £47.5m last summer, has been out injured since January after damaging knee ligaments and he missed Colombia's journey to the quarter-finals of the World Cup.

Yet he is set to make his return to action in the Emirates Cup against Valencia - and he would then play either Arsenal or Benfica, depending on how the teams progress - over the weekend of August 2-3.

'I think he will be able to start playing again at the Emirates Cup. He is now in the final phase of his recuperation,' Jardim said.
