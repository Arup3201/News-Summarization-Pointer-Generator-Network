Nicole Scherzinger and Lewis Hamilton have split for the fourth time and Nicole is reputedly heartbroken.

But I still think it's Lewis who will hurt more. Don't believe the romance novels: women aren't the love slaves.

Psychologists have discovered that, while men still fall in love less often than women, when they fall, they fall harder, quicker – and out of love slower.

So while savvy, smart women like Nicole will do their grieving but then move forward, a lot of 'new age' men like Lewis end up stuck.

Here's six reasons why:

Women have better coping strategies

A typical female reaction to a painful break-up is to hotfoot it to her best friend's house and spend the next three weeks (or three months) talking about her ex and her feelings to anyone that will listen.

Women are more emotionally expressive and healthily in touch with their soft underbellies. By letting out our grief and sadness, we get the pain out of our systems and are able to move on quickly.

Men, God love them, bottle things up.

His reaction to a split with a treasured girlfriend is to mask the pain.

 Nicole appeared to be heartbroken as she emerged for the first time since the split yesterday but Tracey insists that her ex will be suffering the most

He'll either a) not think about it and throw himself into work in an attempt to reaffirm his own worth; or b) not think about it and start sleeping around for the same reasons; or c) not think about it, get drunk and stay out until 3 am, running himself into the ground.

In other words, he'll do just about anything rather than confront the pain and deal with it.

Sleeping around makes things worse

Ironically, the more he's seen about town with replacement bimbettes on his arm, the more he's probably hurting.

It doesn't mean he doesn't care – in fact, quite the opposite.

When people lose someone they love, they're overcome by feelings of worthlessness.

Women cope by getting their act together, proving their worth that way.

For some men, it's simply easier to sleep around: 'If I can pull the chicky-babes, I must be okay.'

Tracey says that unlike Lewis, Nicole will probably find it easier to talk to her friends and get her feelings off her chest rather than bottle things up

This is also why men become self-abusive. They're feeling unloved and unworthy, so treat themselves accordingly, surviving on diets of beer and curry.

What he really should be doing is quite the opposite - looking after himself more and replacing the love lost with another. His own.

He can't talk to his friends the same way women do theirs

While female relationships are based on talking, especially about our feelings, men's relationships are based on doing: things like playing sport, joking around, having a beer.

While some men do have substantial conversations with their friends, many don't.

Talking about their pain or their problems just isn't acceptable: they feel stupid, weak and pathetic if they broach personal topics.

As a result, men are more emotionally independent than women and are used to being self-reliant. Fabulous - until you hit a rough spot.

The female support system is infinitely more helpful at a time like this.

Tracey says that sleeping around after a break up  is a sign that he's struggling to cope 

Even if his friends are concerned about him, they often wouldn't have a clue what to say to fix it.

This is where his platonic girlfriends could well be his saving grace.

It's okay to get advice from a female. 'They even seem to like doing that sort of stuff!', one male friend told me in astonishment.

He didn't see it coming

Women see the writing on the wall when it's in tiny, tiny letters.

Men often wouldn't notice if she wrote, 'You're about to be dumped,' on the bathroom mirror. With his shaving cream.

It's the right-brain, left-brain thing.

The left side of our brain is the 'thinking' part (logic and facts); the right side works with 'feelings' (emotion, intuition, expression).

Usually men are more left-brain dominated and women right-brain.

So he's not as in tune with the touchy-feely side that would warn him she was about to leave.

Tracey says that women are the lucky ones after a split as their looks tend to improve

He loses more mutual friends

While women lean heavily on good friends after a break, men often do quite the opposite.

They tend to drop 'couple' friends in favour of single males who'll go out and party with them.

Sometimes he'll avoid good friends of his ex because it's too painful to hear how well she's faring without him.

The end result: he's lonely and dwells on the past.

Women look better after a split, men often look worse

Women tend to lose weight initially, then do a complete image overhaul when feeling human again as a 'starting over' gesture.

Feeling great and looking fabulous, they're more confident and their social life blooms.

Men tend to mope about depressed.

Says Brendon, a friend of mine, 'My girlfriend transformed herself after I left. It was quite remarkable: she'd gone from a shy wallflower to this incredibly confident girl who everyone wanted at their party.

'No-one asked me anywhere – probably because when they did, I stood in a corner and felt sorry for myself or behaved like a total moron by getting too drunk.'

He doesn't clear out the closet for next time

A crucial part of getting over someone is getting rid of – or at least putting away – remnants of the relationship.

It's all part of letting go. If her old hairbrush is still in the bathroom, he may get stuck and never let go.

If his next girlfriend finds herself walking into a shrine of his ex, she will not be happy.

He might defend the pictures on the wall by saying she's a friend, but it's obvious to her that he's looking for a new relationship to mask the pain of the last one.

Often, it's only when he's met someone new, someone he can trust, that he finally does deal with all the pain the break-up caused.

He has to let go of the hurt at some point - and more often than not, it's the next girlfriend who cops it.

There won't be a next girlfriend, if there's obvious evidence he's still mourning the first and the problem never gets solved!
