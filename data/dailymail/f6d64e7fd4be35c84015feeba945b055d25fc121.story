He is Brazil's very own walking, talking, living doll.

And soon he's going to be a rich one. 

Despite spending £30,000 morphing himself into a human version of Barbie's boyfriend Ken, Celso Santebanes is set to rake it all back and more - with his own line of Celso Dolls. 

The 20-year-old Brazilian, who 'behaves like a puppet', has had four operations on his nose, chin and jaw - plus silicone implants in his chest - to look like Barbie's boyfriend.

Sharing pictures of him and his mini-me on Instagram, he gushed: 'I went to the city to become a model.

'I never expected to have a toy myself.

'I dreamt of being a human puppet, but having one in my image was completely unexpected.' 

Celso, a doll enthusiast, grew up with a shelf-full of dolls and started his transformation after winning a modelling contest at the age of 16.

For years, he claims, his family had been telling him he looked like the doll - which inspired him to become 'a human puppet'.

He changed his last name from Borges Pereira to Santebanes, the name of his favourite character on a Mexican TV show.

Then saved and scrimped to afford each stage of his meticulous transformation. 

Last year, he was spotted by a talk show in his native Sao Paolo, Brazil, and he was catapulted to fame. 

He charges up to £10,000 for a VIP appearance and revealed he is in talks with reality TV show producers.

Now he is preparing to travel to LA next month to launch the Celso Doll.

In an interview with a Brazilian paper he said: 'This is all so magical. My life has changed.

'I feel like the whole of Brazil is supporting me.

'People are sometimes frightened by the way I look, and stop me to say how much I look like a doll! 

Match made in plastic heaven: Celso has vowed to meet with Russian real-life Barbie doll Valeria Lukyanova

'And I do suffer a lot of prejudice. But the world is full of judgemental people, I don't care.'

With a self-professed addiction to staring at his reflection, Celso has also vowed to join forces with the Russian Barbie Valeria Lukyanova.

He said: 'The human Ken bachelor is looking for his Barbie. Who wants to be my girlfriend? After all no one happy alone.'
