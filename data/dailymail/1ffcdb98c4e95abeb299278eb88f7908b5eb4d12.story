Whether it's working up the nerve to ask your boss for a pay rise or finally plucking up the courage to ask the handsome guy from the gym for a date, there's no shortage of situations where a little extra courage wouldn't hurt.

But, while many overcome their nerves, studies have shown that women are more likely to succumb to a lack of confidence - with disastrous results for their career and love life.

Now, a new blog aims to help women face down their fears by encouraging them to submit photos revealing what they would do if they weren't afraid.

Called What Would You Do If You Weren't Afraid, the blog is hosted on Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In website and was inspired by a speech she made at Barnard University.

'The inspiration for the project came 
from a speech Sheryl gave to the graduating class at Barnard a few years
go that ended with the question 'What would you do if you 
weren't afraid?', says LeanIn.Org editor, Jessica Bennett.

'As graduation rolled around this year, we wanted to find a way to play 
off that question to encourage women to pursue their ambitions -- but 
this is clearly a message that women (and many men) of any age can 
relate to.'

Among the women who have already submitted photos is Rani, 15, from West Lafayette in Indianapolis who writes: 'I would LEAD without worrying what people think + prefacing my ideas with "maybe" or "I don’t know, but…"'

The blog is hosted on the website of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (pictured)

Another, Jennifer Evers, 43, from Chicago, writes: 'I’ve taken the first step and created a career and business for myself that I can fit my life in to, instead of trying to fit my life in to someone else’s idea of what a career for me should be. 

'Now I need to take the next step and fully take ownership of everything… professional and personal.'

Sandberg herself has also submitted a photo and a pledge that reads: 'I would write a book about women.'

'We wanted to make the point that women 
often hold themselves back by fear of the unknown: fear of failure, fear
 of speaking up, fear of being judged,' added Jessica.

'Part of leaning in is about 
overcoming our fears to pursue our ambitions -- whatever those may be. 
So why not put our fears out there?

'Why not talk about them? Hold them 
up on a sign? We hope this blog will inspire women to ask themselves, 
'What would I do if I weren't afraid?' And then to go and do it.'
