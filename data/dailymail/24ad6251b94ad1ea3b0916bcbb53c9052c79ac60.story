A driver has captured the shocking moment a car towing a trailer turns blindly into oncoming traffic.

The footage shows a vehicle driving down a street with a 60km/h limit, believed to be in  Wagga Wagga, southwest of Sydney, before colliding into a white wagon and trailer.

Footage of the incident, which was caught on a dashboard camera - or dash cam - shows the motorist driving past two cars, who were both waiting and indicating  to turn right onto the street at the intersection.

But as the driver gets closer to the intersection and becomes aware of the turning vehicle towing a trailer, she is heard slamming on the brakes as it screeches.

The white wagon is seen quickly turning and putting their trailer in the path of oncoming traffic.

With steam coming out of the car bonnet, the driver is heard swearing on impact as she gets out of her car before slamming the door.

The video was supplied by Tegan Ellis, who also commented on the video, saying: 'The cars weren't stopped to let him through, they were waiting to turn into the street on the right,' she wrote.

'The street this involved was a street/highway 60km p/h. The cars waiting to turn were blocking the intersection and his path and I had already entered across the intersection. 

'He admitted at scene couldn't see past 2 cars waiting to turn. Street he was wanting to turn into is a 50km p/h street.'

A caption alongside the video explained: 'One of the most common causes of accidents we see here. People turning when they don't have a clear view.'
