A ‘callous' barmaid hatched a cover story with her uninsured boyfriend to ‘save their own skins’ moments after he killed a cyclist in her car.

Lauren Mellish, 22, was in the vehicle with Alex Dexter, 23, when he  overtook three vehicles in the powerful Ford Puma before losing control and ploughing into Steven Rodway, 38.

As the married father-of-two lay dying under the car, the couple were seen whispering together to concoct a story involving someone else taking it on a test drive.

Mellish eventually confessed the truth
two weeks later and wept in court today as she became the first person 
to be convicted of aiding and  abetting a driver who caused death by 
careless driving.

She was given a six-month term for the
offence, which was created under the Road Safety Act 2006. The maximum 
penalty is two years.

Dexter, who only held a provisional 
licence when he got behind the wheel of her car, looked visibly shaken 
as he was given a 15-month term after admitting  three charges including
causing death by careless driving and causing death  while uninsured.

Speaking after the hearing at 
Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex, Inspector Keith Whiting said: ‘They got 
out of the car and made up a story to cover themselves  without offering
Steven any assistance.

Victim: Married father-of-two Steven Rodway was killed in the accident

‘I have never known such callous actions at the scene of a fatal collision.’

Mr Rodway’s widow Marrissa, 35, said 
she now lived for their children Harriet, six, and Erica, two, but 
always felt lonely without her ‘soul mate’.

She added: ‘Alex Dexter and Lauren 
Mellish have turned our lives upside down and I know I will find it hard
to forgive them for the heartache they have caused our family.’

Dexter, an engineer, was seen 
overtaking three cars before losing control as he tried to avoid a 
transit van on June 13 last year.

The vehicle rolled down the road in 
Stapleford Tawney, near Epping, before coming to rest on its wheels on 
top of insurance worker Mr Rodway, who lived in Hutton, near Brentwood, 
and was out on a Sunday afternoon bike ride.

After climbing out of the overturned car, Dexter told a fireman that ‘another  male had been driving the car’ and had run off.

Mellish also lied, saying that a man she knew only as 'Matt' had been test  driving the car and then escaped after the accident.

Witnesses described seeing the pair - 
who have since split up – ‘whispering to  each other’, adding they 
‘didn’t seem concerned about the cyclist’.

The false story led to police 
launching a major search operation for the  fictional driver, including 
calling out sniffer dogs which were sent into  surrounding fields.

Both defendants refused to comment 
during police interviews and it was only a fortnight later that Mellish 
finally said Dexter had been driving.

Both admitted the charges at a hearing last month. They were also banned from  driving for three years yesterday.

Judge Christopher Ball QC said the 
accident would not have happened if Mellish had not allowed her 
boyfriend to drive and he had to send out a message to  anyone who 
allows their uninsured partner to use their car.

He added: ‘Perhaps worst of all was 
your reaction at the scene. As Mr Rodway  lay dying underneath the car, 
it was to try to save your own skins by inventing  a fictional third 
person and try to identify him as the culpable driver.’
