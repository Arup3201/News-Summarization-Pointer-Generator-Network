By Tuesday afternoon the White House had leaked much of President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, but one detail was as closely guarded as the nation's nuclear launch codes: Who's the designated survivor?

The answer: Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, an MIT nuclear physicist, will stay behind to run the government in case the worst happens and the entire Capitol disintegrates in a hail of radioactive cannon-fire.

The idea is a relic from the Cold War: If the Soviet Union were to launch a missile attack on Washington during the annual address – when the president, vice president, cabinet members, Supreme Court justices and every member of Congress gather in one chamber – someone had to live on to lead the country and mount a response.

'Designated survivor': Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz was chosen to watch Obama's speech from an undisclosed location this year, to guarantee the continuity of government if the rest of America's leading officials were attacked and killed when they gathered in a single place

When President Barack Obama delivers his annual State of the Union address, one of his cabinet members will be somewhere else, tucked away for the sake of the U.S. Constitution

U.S. officials in charge of all three branches of government will gather Tuesday night in the House of Representatives to hear Obama speak. What would happen if the unthinkable should occur while every American political target was in the same place?

Line of succession: Vice President Joseph Biden would become president if Barack Obama should die in office, putting him literally 'a heartbeat away' from the Oval Office

Speaker of the House John Boehner would take over the presidency if both Obama and Biden were dead or unable to perform their duties, providing an unprecedented party switch since Boehner is a Republican

He
 or she – the White House chief of staff typically chooses from among 
members of the president's cabinet – is whisked away well in advance of 
the speech to one of Washington's famed 'undisclosed locations,' just in
 case.

And the public only learns who drew the short straw a few minutes before the president arrives at the Capitol.

The practice is believed to date back to the late 1950s, but the public wasn't made aware of it until the Reagan administration.

Some
 have gone out of town. Others escaped to D.C.'s suburbs for dinner. One
 , HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, hung out in the Roosevelt Room of the 
White House in 1996, at the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue from the U.S. 
Capitol.

After the 9/11 terror attacks, however, the routine became more serious and the locations more clandestine.

The U.S. Senate Historical Office keeps records of which presidential cabinet member has set out on State of the Union night. Any of them could have become president in an instant if a terrorist attack or a nuclear missile had killed the rest of the federal government's leaders.2014: Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz2013: Energy Secretary Steven Chu2012: Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack2011: Interior Secretary Ken Salazar2010: HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan2009: * Attorney General Eric Holder2008: Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne2007: Attorney General Alberto Gonzales2006: VA Secretary Jim Nicholson2005: Commerce Secretary Donald Evans2004: Commerce Secretary Donald Evans2003: Attorney General John Ashcroft and Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta2002: Interior Secretary Gale Norton2001: * VA Secretary Anthony Principi2000: Energy Secretary Bill Richardson1999: HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo1998: Commerce Secretary Bill Daley1997: Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman1996: HHS Secretary Donna Shalala1995: Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 1994: Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy1993: * Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt1992: Agriculture Secretary Ed Madigan 1991: Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan1990: VA Secretary Edward Derwinski 1989: * Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos 1988: Interior Secretary Donald Hodel     1987: Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng 1986: Agriculture Secretary John Block    1985: Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige1984: HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce

* Speeches given in the first year of a presidency are not called State of the Union addresses, but Presidential Addresses before Joint Sessions of Congress

The
 practice of setting aside a designated survivor isn't confined to State
 of the Union speeches.

Several presidential inaugurations have featured
 a designated odd-man-out to respect the Constitution in case the 
federal government's leaders simultaneously go kablooey as the result of
 what homeland security analysts call a 'decapitation attack' on the 
U.S.

Since 2003 a handful of
 members of Congress have also been asked to stay away from the Capitol 
during the annual presidential address, in order to keep the legislative
 branch of the government alive in case of a terrorist attack.

The U.S. Constitution provides for a 
line of succession in case the president should die while in office.

The
 sitting vice president takes over immediately, as Lyndon Johnson did 
after John F. Kennedy's assassination.

But
 if the veep should die too, the Speaker of the House becomes acting 
president, and then the president pro tempore of the Senate.

If
 they're all dead, the Oval Office goes, in order, to the secretaries of
 state, treasury and defense, and then to the attorney general, and so 
on – a list 18 names long.

Everyone
 on the list is currently eligible to serve as president with one 
exception: Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewel is a naturailzed U.S. 
citizen who was born in the United Kingdom, so she can't assume the 
office.

The Secret Service officially controls the movements of the designated 'survivor' each year.

Ken Salazar, the former interior secretary who sat out the speech in 2011, told ABC News that 'there are serious preparations and serious consideration of different scenarios' when the time comes.

The designated survivor is sworn to secrecy and briefed on the procedures involved with ensuring the continuity of government.

'They walked you through the White House and showed you the Situation Room and talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor,' Shalala told ABC.

So someone from President Obama's leadership team – although it won't be clear who until just before 9:00 p.m. EST – will be absent when he uncorks his annual stemwinder.

Or maybe two.

In 2010, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan was the designated 'survivor' for President Obama's speech. But then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also out of town, attending a London conference on battling radical Islamist sects in Yemen.

Because the public knew where to find Her, Clinton couldn't be the official 'survivor.' But if calamity had struck, she would have become America's first female president, since the State Department comes well before the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the order of presidential succession.

But had her husband Bill and his entire administration, plus the Congress, all bitten the dust in 1996, Shalala would have beaten her to it.

The odds of a president dying in office are slim enough, but the chance the his entire cabinet and the leaders in both houses of Congress kicking off at the same time are astronomical.

The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics estimates, based on American history, that a U.S. president has a 1-in-27 chance of dying in office each year.

Compound that across the 18 people in the line of succession, and calculate their odds of all dying on the same day, and it comes to 1 in 357 quattuordecillion.

That's 357 with 47 zeros after it.

Whoever is sitting the speech out Tuesday night had better not quit his or her day job: The Oval Office curtains aren't due for a change until January 2017.

After Boehner, the presidency would fall to Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who serves as president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate

Grey Poupon in the White House mess: Secretary of State John Kerry is the first cabinet member in line to take over the top job if the others above him in line are all dead or incapacitated

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew could be president, provided Barack Obama, Joe Biden, John Boehner, Patrick Leahy and John Kerry were all dead -- and Lew himself had managed to survive

If a sitting U.S. president dies while in office, the Constitution provides for an order of succession to ensure the continuity of the executive branch of government. Here are the lucky officials, in the order in which the job of president would fall to them.

* Jewell is a naturalized U.S. citizen born outside the U.S., so she cannot be sworn in as president
