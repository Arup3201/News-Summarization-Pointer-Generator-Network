A male model who was caught outside the Burj Khalifa with 21g of cocaine has released a rap song to spare him from a life sentence.

Swedish-Iranian Farzan Athari, 29, has been in prison since his arrest on May 14 last year - outside his home in the Burj Khalifa tower.

He was sentenced to life in prison for possession of drugs with intent to promote - which under UAE law amounts to 25 years but the sentence was later reduced to 10 years. 

He has now set up a petition, which has attracted more than 60,000 signatures, to promote his plight and recorded a song from jail asking ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid for a pardon.

The song which is called 'Save My Life' was recorded as Athari sang from a phone booth in Dubai Central Prison.

In the song, Athari blames his situation on falling in with the wrong crowd and insists he has never used drugs.

He sings: 'Save my life, save my life. I need you to forgive me. I'm asking you Your Highness.

'I really want you to know, I didn't use drugs. I always said no, no matter where I was.'

As the song continues, he explains he was living a charmed life after finding success in Dubai as a model and TV presenter.

And in a letter he wrote, which was posted on his blog, Athari insists he was entrapped and his life sentence was actually 'lenient' because he almost got the death penalty.

He says police testified at his trial that an informant had tipped them off that Athari was carrying drugs and intending to supply, but his video explains that his drug tests came back clean.  

In his letter, Athari said: 'Upon my arrest I was kept for two weeks in an empty cell with no bed or toilet, without any rights to a lawyer, no contact with the Swedish embassy, no translator or even a simple phone call to my family or friends to inform them that I’m alive. 

'I was coerced into signing a confession and statements in Arabic, a language which I can’t read or understand – they didn’t give me any other choice. 

'I am not a promoter or dealer of any illegal substance.'

But he admitted that carrying the cocaine was 'the biggest mistake of my life'.

He added: 'I have truly learnt my lesson.

Lyrics in the song explain that he regrets carrying the drugs, but has never taken any himself

'Not a day passes when I’m not afraid or concerned for my life and my health being locked in together with heavy criminals.

'At the time of my arrest, I had a great career and I was involved in a successful local business with two partners and 16 employees. 

'Now, all I have is a decade of jail time before me. 

'I’m asking you with all my heart for your support in a time where I need it the most I ask for mercy because everybody has made a mistake at some point in their life.'

He adds that Dubai is an 'amazing city and he does not intend to criticize it. 

'I have lived and worked in Dubai for three years because it is an amazing city,' he said.

'I was even in the process of writing and producing a theme song to promote the city of Dubai.'

Urging supporters to sign his petition, Athari  apologizes to the ruler of Dubai, his family, friends and others, and ends his letter with the words: 'My life is now in the hands of God, his highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and you.'
