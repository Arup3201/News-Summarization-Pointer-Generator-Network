Session 1: Europe 1½ USA 2½

Pivotal moment: Ian Poulter’s missed putt from two feet on the first green signified that it was not going to be an easy morning for Europe.

Match of session: Rickie Fowler and the previously unsung Jimmy Walker bravely clung on after being down for the first 17 holes to get a last-ditch birdie and halve their match against Thomas Bjorn and the struggling Martin Kaymer.

Stat of the session: At 21 and 24 years old respectively Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed became the youngest ever pairing at a Ryder Cup — and they won.

Rookies Spieth and Reed were the USA's best players at Gleneagles, as well as the youngest pairing

Shot of the session: Walker’s chip in from off the green on the 16th that brought the Americans back to within a single hole.

Quote of the session: Ian Poulter: ‘Obviously my record has been pretty good and that has taken a dent. But this is a team game, it’s not just about singling one or two guys out.’

Session 2: Europe 5 USA 3

Pivotal moment: Rory McIlory holing his 40-foot putt on the 17th to make birdie to give him and Sergio Garcia a chance of levelling it on the 18th.

Match of the session: McIlroy and Garcia were behind from the 11th, but by winning the last two holes to gain a half landed a major psychological blow on the Americans in the last game of the day.

Stat of the session: Every single pairing bogeyed at least one hole at a stage of the match when the greens were arguably at their most difficult.

Rory McIlroy has played in 14 straight Ryder Cup sessions since his debut in 2010. 

Shot of the session: Garcia’s powerful recovery from the rough on the 18th after McIlroy had driven into the trees, landing it on the far side of the green to set up the birdie chance.

Quote of the session: Graeme McDowell on his partner Victor Dubuisson: ‘Victor and I were fired up, and I’m telling you — he is Europe’s next superstar.’

Session 3: Europe 6½ USA 5½

Pivotal moment: Henrik Stenson holing his downhill seven-foot putt on the seventh that brought him and Justin Rose back to one down and sparked their remarkable birdie spree.

Match of the session: Stenson and Rose’s 3&2 win over Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar rewrote some of the record books. The Americans played outstandingly but the Europeans were irresistible.

Stat of the session: In the Stenson/Rose match on quicker greens an all-time high total of 21 birdies were made over 16 holes with the European duo reeling off 10 consecutive birdies from the seventh hole onwards.

Justin Rose, unbeaten throughout the weekend, was simply magnificent on Saturday morning for Europe

Shot of the session: Poulter finally found his traditional Ryder Cup form and celebrated appropriately on the 16th when he chipped in from behind the greenside bunker to bring him and McIlroy back all square.

Quote of the session: On being told Stenson supposedly had a bad back, Watson: ‘What? I didn’t see it. He beat me pretty good two days in a row.’

Session 4: Europe 10 USA 6

Pivotal moment: Reed missing an 18-inch tiddler on the 16th when only a five was needed to go one up. The cost was dear as Europe halved the match eventually on the 18th.

Match of the session: The dynamic duo of Reed and Spieth led Kaymer and Rose most of the way before Rose (who else?) holed his eight-foot putt on the last to gain a half.

Stat of the session: A measure of the potency that McDowell and Dubuisson found in their partnership was that they had the only bogey-free round of the eight pairs in action.

Paul McGinley has a perfect Ryder Cup record, winning three times as a player (2002, 2004, 2006), twice as a vice-captain (2010, 2012) and once as captain (2014). 

Shot of the session: The impressive Dubuisson’s beautifully flighted tee shot on the sixth to within five feet, allowing McDowell to put them a commanding four up against Walker and Fowler.

Quote of the session: Tom Watson on Phil Mickelson’s angst at being left out of the afternoon foursomes: ‘He lobbied again. He texted me and said “Give us a chance”. I had to tell him no.’

Session 5: Europe 16½ USA 11½

Pivotal moment: McDowell’s stirring comeback against Spieth was symbolically and motivationally huge, and his brilliant birdie on the 11th encapsulated it.

McDowell's win, from a difficult situation, gave Europe the momentum they needed on the final day

Match of the session: McIlroy v Fowler. It wasn’t close, but it set the tone of the day and the event as the world No 1 blitzed the USA star challenger.

Stat of the session: Four eagles in the 12 singles equalled the four in the 16 previous matches combined. Three were by Europeans; all the eagle scorers won their matches.

Shot of the session: With due respect to Jamie Donaldson’s historic hit to seal the winning point for Europe, Kuchar’s eagle on the eighth from the fairway was stunning.

Quote of the session: McIlroy: ‘I was probably more up for today than I was for the two final days of the majors I won this year. I was up for it.’
