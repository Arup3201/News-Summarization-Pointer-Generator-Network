King Felipe of Spain and his wife Queen Letizia stepped out to welcome Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to Madrid today.

The royals laughed together as they arrived for the official welcoming ceremony at El Pardo palace outside Madrid.

Letizia, 42, who looked chic in a nude skirt and blouse with black detailing, walked with the Colombian first lady Maria Clemencia Rodriguez during the event.

The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels.

Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch.

As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting.

Her South American counterpart, Maria Clemencia Rodriguez went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket.

The women walked behind their husbands and seemed to have plenty to talk during the stately event which was then followed by an official luncheon at La Zarzuela Palace.

The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. 

No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper.

Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

She's a royal who's garnered a firm fashion following and with outfits like this, it's easy to see why Queen Letizia's style goes down such a storm.

We love the way she's introduced a slight edginess to her look thanks to the studded dress which puts a fresh spin on the otherwise classic colour block design.

Her chic frock is by one of her favourite designers, Felipe Varela, who's designs she often turns to for public appearances. That said, we love the fact she also champions the Spanish high-street by regularly wearing brands like Zara, Uterque and Mango.

The royals admired huge sculptures, including an untitled art work consisting of a  bronze swirl of metal extending out of a matte metal dome, alongside the nation's education, culture and sports minister Ignacio Wert and the Mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella. 

At the event, which will run until 1 March, Letizia gazed at one piece made up of a vast canvas covered in red paint, nailed to the wall, which appeared to drip into a red pool on the floor where lay clustered a paint roller, pots and brushes.

Letizia and her regal husband are no strangers to events celebrating art and culture, they recently attended the inauguration of a a Picasso exhibition at the Museo de Belas Artes in A Coruna in the north west coastal region of Galicia.

In seeming tribute to the legendary Spanish artist, Letizia even wore a Breton-striped top for the event. 

The pair also attended the Picasso Museum in Malaga on Spain's Costa del Sol, in September, before attending a formal dinner

Earlier this week Letizia attended a meeting with the board of the Royal Council on Disability.

One of Letizia's favoured causes, the mother-of-two appeared deep in concentration as she listened to the points raised by her fellow board members.
