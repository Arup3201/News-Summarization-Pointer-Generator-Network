No-show: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has had to fork out £41,700 after he failed to turn up to two New Zealand charity fundraisers for a chronically ill school girl

Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has had to fork out £41,700 after he failed to turn up to two New Zealand charity fundraisers for a chronically ill schoolgirl.

The 45-year-old missed a June 2010 event to raise cash for 11-year-old Matisse Reid, who needed an organ transplant because of a rare intestinal disorder, because his mother suffered a heart attack.

He rescheduled to appear later that year, but again had to cancel because of 'business difficulties'.

Auckland's Duco Events tried to sue him for £1million for his no-show at the sold-out functions, but they settled this week for £41,700.

A spokesman for the firm said: 'The parties have reached a mutually-agreeable financial settlement, including a donation of NZ$100,000 (£51,500) to Matisse Reid and the trust Chance2Eat (the girl's charity).'

It also said Duco and Ramsay had agreed to work together in 2013 on unspecified projects.

The NZ$100,000 (£51,500) payment is reportedly the same as Ramsay's appearance fee for the charity events.

Matisse, from Napier, has been receiving costly life-saving medical treatment in Pittsburgh, U.S. for the last five years.

She underwent a transplant last year, but will still need further treatment. Her mother Jodee said the donation was 'generous, but unexpected'.

Speaking from Pittsburgh, she told the New Zealand Herald: 'We just want it known that we are very grateful to Gordon Ramsay and David Higgins from Duco Events because this is a joint donation from both of them.

'Both of them had a lot of empathy for our situation and neither David nor Gordon really dragged us into the situation.

'They were very mindful of the situation we are dealing with is life and death and they are dealing with business stuff, so we would like it known that we are really grateful for them keeping us out of it and for their very generous donation.'

She added: 'Matisse has not been cured, we are not sure whether she'll need another transplant in the future so the money will be set aside in case we would need it for her.'

And she revealed that, despite having an intestinal condition that left her unable to eat for most of her life, Matisse had a love for food.

The settlement of the court case comes as Ramsay makes a promotional tour to the country, with local media reporting how he faced a real kitchen nightmare.

The Scottish-born cook almost lost his toes as a fan dropped a razor-sharp knife he wanted the chef to sign at an Auckland shop meet-and-greet, but then dropped it on the floor.

Ramsay shouted 'oh, Jesus' as the implement fell from Jeffery Cheung's hand at the Smith & Caughey shop.
