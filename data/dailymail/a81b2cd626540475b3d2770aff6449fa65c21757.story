A British shooter competing in the Commonwealth Game says she was treated 'like a criminal' after taking her shotgun in to a hotel in Dundee.

Rachel Carrie has competed all over the world, but it was on home soil that she was mistakenly identified as a danger to society.

The 30-year-old was reported to the police after taking her shotgun to a hotel she was staying at in Dundee. She was then questioned by police for hours, despite explaining her role in the Games and producing a shotgun license.

The athlete has now complained to Malmaison hotel in Dundee for treating her ‘like a criminal’.

She said: ‘I got to the hotel at around 11pm ... first the staff asked me if I had brought a rifle onto the premises.

I replied no, it is a shotgun, and tried to explain my role in the Commonwealth Games.

‘But they said it was illegal to have a shotgun in a hotel. It is not illegal to have a shotgun in a hotel. 

'They called the police and I was questioned until 2.30am. I was really embarrassed.’

The shooter, from Leeds, had driven five hours to Dundee for the ladies’ double trap competition at the Barry Buddon shooting centre.

The event involves shooting two clay pigeons released from a trap simultaneously.

She said: ‘I have taken my Perazzi 12-gauge shotgun around the world, I have been to America and to most European countries and this has never happened before.’

Miss Carrie was staying in a different 
hotel to the Team England shooters, having been drafted in at the last 
minute as a ‘filler’ – who can shoot for any team which is unable to 
field the required number of competitors.

Her shotgun was eventually taken to be stored at a police station.

Carrie, who is also a model, said she is worried the lack of sleep affected her performance.

The hotel’s general manager Josie Simcox confirmed yesterday: ‘We do not allow firearms in the guest bedrooms.’
