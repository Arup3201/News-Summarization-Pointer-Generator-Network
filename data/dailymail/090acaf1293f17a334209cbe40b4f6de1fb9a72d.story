There's a place for everything inside the Walsh family’s six-bedroom home, and everything’s in its place.

If only there was space for anything else.

For wherever there is a nook or cranny, it is occupied by an ornament.

There’s enough blue delft china to start a pottery shop and not one wall remains unadorned. Save for a few square inches of kitchen worktop (not counting the toilet lid and cistern) barely a single flat surface is visible.

Take a seat (if you can): Plumped up cushions, lamps and trinkets fill the lounge of the Walsh family's six-bedroom home

In the 13 months the immaculately kept house has been on the market, it hasn't been to anyone else's tastes. Meanwhile the semi has become the subject of an internet snob-fest, with critics from Mumsnet to Facebook offering unkind opinions

Minimalist is a word unlikely to have been used much in this house. Even the modest size bathroom boasts a chandelier. Nor is there any escape in the garden, awash with ornaments, statues and ironwork.

Naturally, it is all a question of personal taste. Alas, in the 13 months the immaculately kept house has been on the market, it hasn’t been to anyone else’s. 

It is, as estate agents tend to say, still waiting for the right buyer. 

Meanwhile the otherwise anonymous semi has become the subject of an internet snob-fest, with critics from Mumsnet to Facebook offering unkind opinions on the décor as the Rightmove property website details clock up thousands of hits and go viral.

Yesterday the downsizing family trying to sell the house answered the doorbell (the chimes play Oh My Darling Clementine) but declined to comment on the home’s unlikely celebrity status. It is understood they are baffled by the interest, and reportedly offended by some of the less polite criticism online.

One Mumsnet contributor suggested having a £1-a-head whip-round to buy it as a competition prize.

Another said that simply to look at the pictures ‘gives me a panic attack’. On Facebook, ‘Call in the House Doctor!’ was one de-cluttering suggestion; another speculated over whether the three dogs in front of the fireplace were stuffed.

The house has been owned by 56-year-old Gillian Walsh and her second husband David since 1986. Her distinctive taste in furnishings formed the backdrop for bringing up three children by her first marriage, as well as five children with 58-year-old Mr Walsh

In October last year it was on the market for just under £350,000 but the price has since been cut by £50,000 and is now marked as a 'premium listing'

On the plus side, however, many declared admiration for whoever does the dusting at 45 Forefield Lane, a leafy street in Crosby, on the outskirts of Liverpool.

Crosby is better known nationally for sculptor Antony Gormley’s eerie collection of 6ft iron casts of his body, which stand looking out to sea on the beach.

Cherie Blair was raised a few streets away in the Waterloo neighbourhood.

Despite some less than kind comments about the chintzy decor, cascading silk blooms and mountains of plump satin cushions - some on social networks have praised whoever 'does the dusting' in the immaculately kept house

In a textbook piece of estate agent blurb, the details give not a hint of the décor, leaving the photographs, perhaps, to speak for themselves

Nor is there any escape from the clutter in the garden, awash with ornaments, statues and ironwork

'They love their home but it's too big for them now,' a neighbour confided yesterday. 'They don't see what all the fuss is about. It's the house they're selling, not the ornaments'

How the agent managed to give accurate dimensions for the rooms must surely have been a triumph for a steady hand and laser-measure technology.

‘They love their home but it’s too big for them now,’ a neighbour confided yesterday.

‘They don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s the house they’re selling, not the ornaments.

'But it will take them a while to pack everything up when they move.’
