Offensive: This image, which is too explicit to reproduce in full, shows an escort named Gemma kneeling naked on the altar of St Bartholomew's church in Goodnestone, Kent and clutching a crucifix

Christian leaders have been scandalised after an escort took naked pictures of herself inside a church and posted them online.

The explicit images show a sex worker known as 'Gemma' straddling the altar holding a crucifix and spreading herself over a grave while nude.

She later uploaded the photographs, which were taken without the permission of church officials, onto a website used by punters looking for an escort.

Local vicars described the photo 
shoot in Grade I-listed St Bartholomew's Church in Goodnestone, Kent as 
'shameless' and suggested that it would upset believers.

Gemma,
who claims to be from nearby Margate, says on her online profile that 
she charges £120 an hour for 'domination and sensual fetish sessions'.

At
least two of the pictures she uses to tout her wares were taken at 
12th-century St Bartholomew's, which is no longer used for services but 
is open to worshippers under the care of the Churches Conservation 
Trust.

Reverend Andy 
Bawtree, vicar of St Peter & St Paul church in River near Dover, 
criticised the woman's decision to use a place of worship for her 
escorting activities.

'Although God made the human body a beautiful thing, there is a time and a place for it,' he said.

'I
think this is just sad this young lady has decided to use the church - 
which is a big part of the community, as it houses the post office - in 
this manner.

'It's a place of joy and worship. Surely there's a better way of meeting people.'

Historic: The 12th-century church no longer hosts services but is still open to Christian worshippers

'Shameless': The pictures were posted on an escorts' website in an attempt to drum up business

Reverend John Leach, of St John's 
church in Folkestone, added: 'The pictures show the loss of the sense of
sacred we have in society in general.

'I
think it’s not on really and it’s something I deplore. I think the 
whole thing is shameless and shows no consideration for those who may 
have walked past and seen it by accident.

'There are those who will be repulsed by the sacrilegious side of it.'

A spokesman for the Churches Conservation Trust said: 'We’re very sorry to hear pictures of this nature have been taken at our church without our permission.

'Our churches are open to all as heritage attractions and places of peace and calm, we expect visitors to treat the buildings with the respect they deserve, as well as being respectful of the local community and their use of these buildings.'
