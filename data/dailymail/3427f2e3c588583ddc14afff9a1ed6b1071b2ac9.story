A newborn baby, his one-year-old sister and their three-year-old brother have been killed in a devastating house fire.

Two-week-old Victorino Robledo, sister Angelica, and brother Salvador Junior, all died when their mobile home in Texas, was engulfed by flames in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Their grandmother, who was asleep in the adjoining trailer when the fire broke out, has told how her husband managed to drag the youngsters' parents and a seven-year-old boy to safety, but was unable to reach the other children through the flames and smoke.

The sleeping children were left trapped when the fire broke out at around 5am yesterday morning.

The flames had spread to the adjoining mobile home where their grandmother Evangelina Robledo and her husband lived.

'My husband heard when something was popping,' Mrs Robledo told Action 4 News.

'I said "honey, 'the kids! The kids!"

'He said: "My love, there's nothing else I can do. I can't get them 
out,"' said the grandmother, who added that not going back into the burning home would always haunt her.
