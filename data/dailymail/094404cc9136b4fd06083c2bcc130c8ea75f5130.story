More than 100 armed police officers swooped on a home and engaged in a tense 19-hour stand off with a man armed to the teeth - with a bottle of Cillit Bang.

But despite his kitchen arsenal of bleach-based products, Richard Jablonski was unable to make a clean getaway.

Instead, the crack tactical operations squad arrested him for possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear and violence.

Under siege: At least 100 officers surrounded he home of Richard Jablonski's, who was armed with a bottle of household cleaner

Bang! And the dirt is gone: Cillit Bang was made famous by adverts featuring the loud-mouthed fictional character Barry Scott

No messing: At least 100 armed officers surrounded Richard Jablonski's home last January after reports he had armed himself with a gun

Incredibly, Jablonski, 38, was later charged and hauled before a court.

But the bizarre case was finally dropped at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Tuesday after prosecutors failed to offer any evidence.

Jablonski, from Stoke-on-Trent, 
Staffs., had been due to stand trial early next month but Judge Paul 
Glenn returned a not guilty verdict.

Staffordshire
Police refused to reveal the cost of the case - despite coming under 
pressure from their own police authority members.

But estimates based on officers’ overtime and the cost of an armed response team have priced the siege at around £30,000.

A similar siege involving 50 officers surrounding a house for 20 hours in Gloucester cost taxpayers £15,000.

If the case had gone to trial at crown court, the final bill would have run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Paul Spratt, prosecuting, told the court: 'When officers got to the address the defendant was alleged to have produced a gun, before retiring into the property and holding them at bay.

'The defendant asserted what he was holding was a bottle of Cillit Bang.

'There is an unresolvable conflict between the evidence from the police and the evidence of the defendant.

'Therefore the prosecution offers no evidence in this case.'

Armed police had cordoned off part of an estate as they tried to coax Jablonski out of the house during the siege on January 6.

Cillit Bang is known for its gaudy TV ads featuring famed shouter Barry Scott, as well as claims to have 'miraculous' cleaning powers.

Launched in Hungary in 2003, Cillit Bang was unleashed on the UK in November 2004 as a rival to the then all-conquering Mr Muscle.

The £5m TV ad campaign introduced the nation to the fictional Barry Scott, played by actor Neil Burgess, who would demonstrate Cillit Bang's cleaning ability before barking the product's slogan, 'Bang! And the dirt is gone'.

While the initial reaction to the ads was one of mockery, the degreaser quickly gained a cult popularity, while huge sales followed thanks to its industrial-strength cleaning ability.

The consumer goods firm behind the product, Reckitt Benckiser, are among the biggest worldwide, while its Dutch chief executive Bart Becht has made millions from the cleaner.

Mr Becht, hailed by experts as a 'very, very successful marketer', broke the British record for executive pay in 2009, taking home more than £90m in cash and shares in one year.

Cillit Bang has not been a complete success story however; in 2010 it topped a UK-wide poll to find the country's most disliked brand name.

After the incident, officers recovered a BB gun from Jablonski’s kitchen - although it is now accepted he was not holding the firearm during the siege.

Staffordshire Police today defended the costly operation.

In a joint statement with Staffordshire Crown Prosecution Service, the force said: 'The CPS, after consulting with Staffordshire Police, has decided to offer no evidence, for legal and evidential reasons.

'For the duration of the incident the 
police response was overseen by highly-trained and skilled officers who 
managed the situation in a measured manner and ultimately brought it to a
safe and peaceful conclusion.

'Despite the outcome of the court case the police response was entirely necessary and proportionate.

'We
recognise the disruption this incident caused to the local community at
the time and wish to thank people for their support and understanding.

'Staffordshire Police take reports of incidents where firearms are believed to be involved very seriously.

'Our absolute priority is to ensure the safety of the public, our officers and those individuals involved.'
