Ashley Young may have been struggling with injuries at Manchester United, but the winger has revealed he is loving life off the pitch as the official dressing room DJ.

The 29-year-old was posting live in an official Q&A on his Facebook page on Thursday, as he described his favourite ever goal and his thoughts on team-mates.

And Young also gave an insight into his DJ style, admitting he took over the decks from former left back Patrice Evra in the summer.

'I officially took over when Patrice Evra left but I should have taken over sooner, some of his choices were a bit....!' said Young. 

'Since I've become the dressing room DJ I've tried to listen to a variety of things to try and please everyone with my choices, but my favourite types are hip-hop, RnB, house and reggae.'

Young made his first Manchester United appearance in over the month after injuring his hamstring at Stoke when he came off the bench against Cambridge in the FA Cup on Tuesday night.

His return is a boost for Louis van Gaal, and his team-mates, while Young also spoke about a former Red Devil and who he would most want to welcome back to Old Trafford.

'Eric Cantona [is who I'd bring back]. I've seen so much footage of him and you can tell how highly thought of he is because the fans still sing his name,' Young said.
