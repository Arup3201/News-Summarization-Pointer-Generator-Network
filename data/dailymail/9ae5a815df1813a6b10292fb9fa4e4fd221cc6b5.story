It was once a common way for boxers to hone their bodies for a big fight, but modern training methods have seen the practice of chopping wood somewhat die out.

Floyd Mayweather, however, has gone old school in his preparation to face Manny Pacquiao. 

The pound-for-pound king has released a video of himself chopping wood on his official Instagram account - emulating past greats such as Muhammad Ali, Rocky Graziano and the fictional Rocky, of course.

Wearing a yellow top and white beanie, Mayweather takes eight impressive hacks at a log on the floor. And even for a supreme athlete such as Mayweather, the task is somewhat of a struggle with the 38-year-old clearly challenged by the task.

Mayweather's latest video comes after he was filmed skipping in his gym - to Phil Collins' no less - and pictured hitting a speed bag and heavy bag. 

With a little over seven weeks until Mayweather meets Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2, the training will no doubt intensify

Mayweather posted this pictured of his new diamond encrusted, gold watch on his Shots account. 

Pacquiao last week was filmed pounding the streets on numerous occasions and then working out with fans at a public event.  

Away from the fight, Mayweather gave fans another glimpse of what the riches of boxing can buy, posting a picture on his Shots account of a diamond encrusted watch.

It is unknown how much the timepiece cost, but the custom-made jewellery would not have been cheap - although for the man who calls himself Money that would be no problem.
