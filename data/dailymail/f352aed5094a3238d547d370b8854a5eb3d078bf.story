If the ‘Alpine Messi’ were anything like as dangerous as the real 
thing, one imagines Pep Guardiola would have embraced him more than he 
has at Bayern Munich. 

That, however, might be a rather harsh 
assessment of Xherdan Shaqiri when his progress as a winger has so 
often been blocked in Bavaria by Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. 

More
 tellingly, perhaps, Shaqiri has made no secret of his reluctance to 
remain an understudy much longer. Having enjoyed more football under 
Guardiola’s predecessor Jupp Heynckes, the 22-year-old is publicly 
angling for a move — possibly to the Premier League and perhaps to 
Liverpool.

So tonight represents quite an opportunity for Shaqiri; a chance to appear on the same pitch as Messi and display his skills in what promises to be a fascinating last-16 encounter. 

It is fascinating because it is by no means a given that Argentina, while obvious favourites, will beat  Switzerland and progress to the quarter-finals, not least because their defence is one that players of Shaqiri’s ability can exploit. 

While Messi and his colleagues will be just as encouraged by Switzerland’s defensive disaster against France, there is also plenty to leave a coach of Ottmar Hitzfeld’s  considerable expertise thinking their illustrious opponents can be got at. 

The lack of pace among Argentina’s defenders makes them particularly vulnerable to Shaqiri’s speed. He might be small like Messi — in Switzerland they call him ‘the magic dwarf’ — but those powerful thighs generate the kind of speed that terrifies centre halves and full backs.  As well as the hat-trick he scored in the last group game against Honduras, Shaqiri collected another man-of-the-match award for his display against Ecuador in Switzerland’s opening game. He is an emerging star whose stock might have risen yet again come this evening — especially if he  demonstrates his versatility in starting, as he did against  Honduras, as a No 10. 

Argentina manager Alejandro Sabella found yesterday that his team’s defensive frailties remain a concern for his country’s media.

They witnessed their problems in the group stage — the fragility in 
the first game against Bosnia-Herzegovina and the fact that  Sergio 
Romero had to be at his very best in goal to stop Iran scoring. Never 
mind the two goals they  conceded against a Nigeria team that over-ran 
them at times with their pace and power.

Sabella accepts there is 
cause for concern. He stressed, repeatedly, the need to achieve greater 
 ‘balance’ and not leave ‘huge spaces between defence and attack because
 of the speed of the forwards’.

At one stage he likened the 
situation to an NBA game, arguing  that the ‘supporters cry defence  
whenever a team is attacking’. For his sake one can only hope his team 
understand his point better than his audience did.

There were 
inevitable questions about Messi, and having fought against the idea 
that his team depend too heavily on their superstar No 10 he seems to 
have now conceded defeat. ‘We depend on him like Brazil depend on 
Neymar,’ he said while at the same time agreeing that Messi can be to 
this Argentina team what Diego Maradona was to the 1986 side.

It is 
probably a  statement worthy of headlines, but it was said with a slight
 tone of resignation. He has tried to resist such talk but, really, 
what’s the use? After four goals in the group stage and almost 
single-handedly securing the nine points that carried them into the last
 16, there is no getting away from it: Messi is crucial to Argentina.

Of
 less certainty is the way Argentina will approach this game, whether 
sticking with the 4-3-3  formation Messi and the players demanded midway
 through their opening group game or switching to a more defensive 4-4-2
 to offer the back four a bit more protection.

Ezequiel Lavezzi, who 
did well when he came on as a replacement for the injured Sergio Aguero,
 has the energy and the versatility to perform such a role, although 
there was talk yesterday of bringing in Maxi Rodriguez. 

Sabella was 
pressed to reveal his starting line-up. ‘I won’t decide until I am about
 to sleep, at midnight tonight,’ he said. ‘Can we call you at midnight?’
 a journalist from  Argentina then asked him. ‘If you have my number you
 can,’ replied Sabella. ‘But I may not answer.’ 

He wouldn’t answer the question of whether playing in  Brazil provides Argentina with that extra bit of motivation. 

Perhaps
 because he knows that, for all the brilliance of Messi and players such
 as Angel  Di Maria, his team must improve. ‘There is no longer room for
 mistakes,’ admitted Sabella. 

Certainly not with Shaqiri on the field.
