South Australia has topped the list of states with the highest number of rude tweets, while New South Wales' Illawarra was found to be Australia's rudest suburb.

Melbourne's Simon Jackson took it upon himself to discover who in Australia was firing off the most profanities in their tweets.

Armed with almost 10 years' experience in the geospatial industry, Mr Jackson - from Esri Australia - found 3.9 per cent of the 256,755 tweets posted by South Australians from June 6, 2013 to March 14, 2014 contained a swear word.

Melbourne's Simon Jackson set out to find which areas around Australia swore the most in their tweets

The state was closely followed by Queensland on 3.18 per cent and NSW on 3.17 per cent.

As for suburbs, it was found more than one in three tweets posted from suburbs in the Illawarra area had profanities in it.

This was more than double the amount fired off by people at Wakefield in South Australia, which was the second rudest suburb with 15.5 per cent of their tweets containing a swear word.

Mr Jackson's list of swear words included about 1,000 phrases from s**t to WTF.

Through his research, the geographical information systems consultant also found other than English, the top five languages people tweeted in across Australia were Japanese, Malaysian, Arabic Indonesian and Spanish.

During his study, Mr Jackson was able to observe the phenomena of tweeting hotspots and their locations.

'Of the football stadiums I was looking at around Melbourne, like the MCG, there were a lot of profanities being tweeted around them,' he said.

'Up in the northern tip of Queensland at Prince of Wales Island, you can see a smooth line of all these people tweeting and I think this is where people on boats get into range of Australia and can start tweeting.'

Mr Jackson said airports and traffic lights were other interesting hotspots.

'Even though you're meant to turn off your phones, there are quite a few people who are still tweeting on the runway and you can see them tweeting things like "I’m on my way to Bali" or farewells and stuff,' he said.

'There are also hotspots at particular junctions with traffic lights, where I assume people are tweeting and sharing their locations, and it’s interesting to see that is what’s happening when you shouldn't be on the phone.'

Other observations made by Simon Jackson were swearing hotspots around football stadiums as well as tweeting hotspots at traffic lights and airport runways

To collect the data, Mr Jackson used a Twitter function called Streaming API. This function shares the location of tweets.

'Every time you tweet and choose your location, Twitter offers people the chance to listen in while they tweet within Australia,' he said.

'It is typically used for marketing purposes to see what people are saying about a certain brand in certain areas.

'I was able to use this data and plot it out on a map.'

To find out language trends, Mr Jackson used the Google Language Detector to translate tweets.

Even though, this study was a bit of fun, Mr Jackson said the functions used in this study could be applied practically.

'During the Sydney bushfires, we had a map that looked at real time sources to find out things like what roads were closed,' he said.

'In London, they also use this function to predict events, such as riots, after the London riots happened.'
