A college student who went missing following a spring break party had been found dead near a water park in south Texas.

The body of Jordan Britten, 20, from Killeen, Texas, was discovered in a marsh nearly one week after his disappearance last Friday.

Mr Britten was found wearing nothing but his underwear, and police say they had previously recovered drugs from the student's car.

Mr Britten had been attending a spring break concert at a water park on South Padre Island, near the Mexican border, on Friday night.

The student is said to have 'wandered off' during the party and was reported missing on Sunday when his family was alerted by his friends, NY Daily News reports.

Local police found the Central Texas College student's car parked at the water park and recovered 'marijuana, what appeared to be ecstasy pills and other unknown pills' in the silver Mazda.

Mr Britten's undressed body was discovered by police in the marsh behind the Schlitterbahn waterpark on Thursday morning.

Police view the death as 'suspicious' due to the discovery of drugs in Mr Britten's car.

Authorities are investigating the possibility that Mr Britten was ejected from the spring break concert and was attempting to re-enter the water park from the back by walking through the marsh. 

'At this time we're investigating all possibilities considering the fact that we did find drugs in his car,' South Padre Island city spokesman Adrian Rodriguez told the NY Daily News.
