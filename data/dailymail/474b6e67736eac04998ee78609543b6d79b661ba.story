After winning more than £1million on the Lottery, Eloise Hutchinson could have let the windfall go to her head.

Instead, she celebrated by  having a pub meal with her  boyfriend – and got him to pay.

The 19-year-old has insisted that her feet will remain firmly on the ground despite scooping £1,346,840 – and becoming one of Britain’s richest teenagers in the process.

So far she has succumbed to a modest shopping spree, limiting herself to an iPad and some clothes. She has also turned down her  sister’s request for a Range Rover, instead offering to hand over her 12-year-old Ford Fiesta.

Miss Hutchinson, from  Colchester, said: ‘It still has not sunk in. Not at all.

‘I went and bought an iPad on  Friday
 and then I went to Lakeside [shopping centre] on Saturday and did some 
clothes shopping. I am going to just carry on as normal though. The 
money will just help me out in future.’

Miss Hutchinson bought the lucky dip ticket at the Co-op store where she works part-time.

Although she originally thought she 
had matched only four numbers, it was her boyfriend of eight months, 
David Heard, 25, who pointed out she had all six –  7, 11, 37, 38, 42 
and 44.

The teenager, who lives in a  
semi-detached house with her disabled mother Joanne and sister Sophie, 
17, a student, shared the New Year’s Eve jackpot with two other ticket 
holders, both of whom have opted to remain anonymous. At a press 
conference yesterday, Miss Hutchinson said: ‘I was actually at home when
 I found out.

‘I didn’t check the ticket until New Year’s Day and it was not until the afternoon.

‘I didn’t find out how much it was until 8pm that evening when I got a call back and they told me I had won £1.3million.’

Feet on the ground: Miss Hutchinson hasn't made any extravagant plans for her new-found wealth and keeps a track of how much she's spent in a book she carries with her at all times

A couple of days later she went out 
for the meal with Mr Heard, a waiter, and two other friends. Miss 
Hutchinson said: ‘I had soup for starter and a nice pork dish for my 
main but there was no champagne as I was driving.’

And she revealed that friends had expected something completely different when she said she had some news.

‘Everyone’s said “You’re not pregnant are you?”’ she added.

Miss Hutchinson is now planning a 
holiday in Jamaica and may  move in with her boyfriend.  She has also 
resolved to buy  herself a new Fiesta rather than an expensive car.

And she plans to carry on working at 
the supermarket and use the rest of her time to make a success of the 
mobile beauty therapy business she set up last year with the help of the
 Prince’s Trust.

Mr Heard, who paid just over  £60 for
 the celebratory meal, said: ‘I’m just so pleased for Eloise. It could 
not have happened to a  nicer person.’

Drug addiction: 16-year-old lottery winner Callie Rogers

Eloise Hutchinson’s attitude is a far cry from that of previous  Lottery winner Callie Rogers, who was just 16 when she scooped the £1.9million jackpot in 2003.

Within months, she had become addicted to drugs, including cocaine, and had spent much of her win on four homes, luxury cars and breast implants.

She later made three attempts to kill herself, the last time in  2010 after she lost custody of her two children.

Two years ago she revealed she had just £100,000 left of her win.

Miss Rogers, now 25, from Cockermouth in Cumbria, said: ‘I am finally becoming the woman I want to be.

'And it’s only after I’ve spent most of my fortune that this has happened.’
