A grandmother has defender her toyboy lover who was jailed for beating a stranger unconscious - and wants to marry him behind bars.

Christopher Bradbury, 25, was drunk when he punched, kicked and stamped on Simon Bloor in Stoke in August last year.

Bradbury, 25, pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm and three counts of dealing heroin, but his fiancee Wendy Hulme, who is twice his age, says she wants to marry her 'teddy bear' before he is released from prison.

Bradbury admitted three charges of supplying heroin, as well as the vicious attack, at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday.

He was caught dealing the class A drugs by an undercover police officer. 

Jailing Bradbury for three years and four months, Judge David Fletcher said: 'This was a sustained and serious assault on a vulnerable victim where you used your foot as a weapon.

'The assault was an assault that you have little memory of because of your abuse of alcohol. You were unable to know what sparked this confrontation but it was prolonged attack.

'The reason you stopped was because members of the public felt they needed to intervene and quite rightly called the police.

'The injuries were not as serious as they might have been but there are ongoing effects of this assault.' 

But Miss Hulme, who has two children and two grandchildren, today defended her toyboy lover, saying that he is a 'little teddy bear really'.

Toyboy lover: Bradbury, who drunkenly assaulted a stranger, is a 'little teddy bear really', Miss Hulme said

The couple met at a pub 15 months ago and plan to marry at HMP Dovegate, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.

Miss Hulme said: 'I know Christopher better than anybody. I am not saying he is sweet and innocent but he has got feelings, he has got a very big heart and he is not the cold blooded person he has been made out to be.

'He has really calmed down. I know how it makes him look but he is a little teddy bear really. It was just a drunken mistake.

'I don't see that side of him, he is so good to me and so caring.

'He is having flashbacks and when he sees the pictures of the man he is absolutely sickened to the stomach by what he did.

'I was really upset but we were expecting the jail sentence. I am standing by him and we are hoping to get married.

'I would love all the nice things for the big day, it's every woman's dream, but I love him. It's not about the fanciness, I would just love to be his wife and I don't care where it happens.

'It isn't the best place but I have thought about it and I will marry him in there if it can go ahead.'

During Bradbury's court case, prosecutor Joanne Barker said he had been shouting abuse at drivers before turning on Mr Bloor, 51, who was walking home after a night out on August 10 last year.

She added: 'Simon Bloor was walking along Waterloo Road when he saw Bradbury shouting and screaming in the middle of the road.

'Mr Bloor walked past him and the defendant walked up to him and asked him what he was looking at.

'Mr Bloor started to walk away but he felt a heavy blow to his head. The defendant proceeded to punch, kick and stamp on him repeatedly, many of the blows were aimed at his head.

'Passers-by called out for the defendant to stop, some of them ran over to intervene, but Bradbury continued.

'Mr Bloor was unconscious on the ground and was helped up by members of the public. The defendant was still trying to get at him.

'Mr Bloor was helped into a nearby house before being taken to hospital. It was suspected he had sustained a fractured jaw and eye socket but fortunately he was found to have a multiple bruises and swelling.

'The defendant was arrested and he denied being part of the assault, but he was later identified in an identity parade.'

Defending, Andrew Turnock said: 'Christopher Bradbury is 25 and has a number of previous convictions as a petty offender.

'He accepts responsibility for this incident, the injuries mercifully, weren't as serious as they could be. But this was a sustained attack and the victim was vulnerable.

'He feels remorse. He's embarrassed and ashamed by the injuries he's caused to this gentleman.

'He has been in a relationship with a lady who has been a mature and stabilising influence for him.

'He has a wedding arranged at Dovegate Prison for next month. He looks forward to engaging in his marriage upon his release.'
