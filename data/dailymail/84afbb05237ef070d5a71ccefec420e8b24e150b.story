For those enjoying the unseasonably warm weather, the blast of freezing Arctic cold sweeping across Britain is in unwelcome reminder of what winter's normally like.

But anyone with an eye for a stunning photograph is sure to welcome the dusting of snow which helps create a picturesque winter scene.

The scene below was the view earlier today across Carr Shields in Northumberland, as a icy weather front swept south across the country from Siberia.

Forecasters expect temperatures are set to drop as low as -2C overnight.

The
Department of Health issued a 
'Level 2' cold-weather alert running for the next two to three days, 
which is triggered when low temperatures give rise to significant health
risks.

It warned that low temperatures can especially be dangerous for the young and the elderly or those with chronic disease.

Meanwhile, the Met Office put much of
Britain on a 'yellow alert' for people to 'be aware' of the adverse 
weather conditions. 

It said: 'Icy stretches are expected to form on untreated surfaces, especially in places affected by showers.

'The
showers will fall as snow above about 250 metres, but there may be 
temporary slush deposits to lower levels. The public should be aware of 
possible travel disruption.'

Forecasters say snow is likely to fall 
on Monday across northern England, Wales and parts of the south-west. 
There will also be snow showers in East Anglia and the south-east on 
Tuesday.

Dan Williams, of the Met Office, 
said: ‘This is certainly the longest run of colder weather we will have 
seen so far this winter.

'There’s
cold air pushing in from the east, and it’s looking very wintry over 
the next few days and might last for the first half of February.’

The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east.

Britain has seen very little wintry weather so far this season – but nothing is ever straightforward with our weather.

After three consecutive harsh winters we have reverted to what is seen as more typical winter weather.

Perhaps this year we have felt cheated by above-average temperatures and just a few frosty mornings.

Now the snowdrops have appeared in the garden it seems that spring is not too far away.

Prior to the winter of 2008-09 there had been only one truly harsh winter in the previous 17 years – and that began late in the season.

Cold winds first reached us from Siberia in thefinal week of January 1995, leading to heavy snow showers.

So could there be a sting in the tail this year?History says it can happen, even after one of the mildest winters on record.

As recently as last Wednesday the temperature peaked at 12.1C at Hawarden in Flintshire, but a band of heavy rain sweeping into the North Sea by Thursday brought cold winds and snow showers to higher ground.

The prospects for the coming week are for the coldest weather so far, with hard frosts overnight, snow flurries and perhaps just the higher ground seeing any heavy snow.

Latest forecasts say tonight will 
remain mainly dry overnight, with light winds and clear spells allowing a
widespread frost and some patches of freezing fog to form. Far northern
and western areas will be cloudier and a little milder however, with 
spells of mostly light rain.

Sunday is expected to be cloudy with 
some rain in western parts, with snow over hills in Wales and 
southwestern England later. Otherwise mainly fine after any fog clears, 
although showery in the far east.

On Monday a slow-moving band of rain 
with hill snow in western parts will continue on Monday, before cold, 
and bright conditions with isolated showers push westwards towards 
midweek.

Over the next couple of weeks, the 
weather is forecast to be mostly settled and cold leading up to the 
first weekend, especially towards the southeast of England, with 
widespread overnight frost and some wintry coastal showers towards the 
east.

However, northwestern parts will soon
become cloudier, more unsettled, but milder with spells of rain and 
some snow, the snow mainly on hills.

Although there is considerable 
uncertainty, the bright, cold conditions will probably continue for a 
time into the second week in the east.

The unsettled but milder conditions 
in the west will probably spread erratically further east with time, 
introducing spells of rain and some snow, again mainly on hills. This 
progression may be coupled with strong winds and possibly gales in 
northwestern parts.

The cold spell breaks what has so far been one of the warmest winters on record.

The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east.

Forecasters said it was becoming 
increasingly likely that the freezing temperatures would stick around 
and even last through the whole of February.

George
Goodfellow of the Met Office said: ‘It seems like we are edging toward a
scenario where lower temperatures last for the next four weeks. It is 
going to be a contrast to the weather we have had this winter. 
Widespread frosts and snow could affect large areas.’

He said the wintry weather was a result of ‘a cold air mass moving across from Siberia’.

There are fears that the sudden onset could bring travel chaos and catch many drivers off guard.

AA
spokesman Luke Bodett said: ‘We have had a very mild winter so far and 
motorists need to get into their winter mindset from today. It is going 
to be important not to charge around in the way they may have been used 
to and be prepared for the unexpected.’

The Met Office has briefed government 
departments and local councils about the cold period so that extreme 
weather plans can be put on standby.
