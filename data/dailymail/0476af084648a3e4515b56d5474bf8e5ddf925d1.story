Luis Suarez has had keyhole surgery on his knee and is expected to recover in time for the World Cup, says his mother.

Sandra Diaz said the surgery was successful and that he is expected to recover in two-three weeks, which means he would be able to line up against England. 

'The surgery is over and thank God everything went well. What Luis had wasn't as serious as we thought,' she said on her son's injury.

Uruguay, who allege Suarez picked up the injury during Liverpool's final game of the Premier League season, remain confident he will be involved on June 19. Sportsmail understands that the country's football officials believe the 27-year-old is unlikely to be fit for the World Cup opener against Costa Rica, but that he could play five days later.

Out? Luis Suarez is touch and go for the World Cup after it was revealed he needs surgery on a knee injury

Race against time: Suarez is unlikely to be fit for Uruguay's first World Cup match against Costa Rica

But Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez suggested if Suarez's recovery went to plan he could return to training in just over a fortnight.

'We know the surgery was a success and that the injury is not serious. We have to wait and see how he recovers,' he told Uruguayan newspaper La Ovacion.

"We had very little time to react and without knowing the extent of the injury, we didn't want to raise the alarm to the public.

'These are injuries that, considering Suarez's fitness and if the recovery is good, will not take long for him to return to play.

'We have to calculate if he will arrive for the first, second of third (group game at the World Cup).

'We know that normally the recovery period, if all goes well, is around 15 days to return to training.'We all know what Luis represents to the national team and more so, considering the great form he was in.

'Considering how valuable he is to the national team, it is a big concern for us.'

Suarez, who was named the Professional Footballers' Association and Football Writers' Association player of the year after scoring 31 league goals, is his country's all-time leading scorer with 39 in 77 appearances.

He picked up the injury in training and, following the meniscus surgery, the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the sidelines.

Suarez's sister Giovanna said her brother began feeling an uncomfortable pain during his last Premier League game and it returned during his first day of training with the Uruguayan national team on Wednesday.

Knock: The Liverpool striker picked up the injury on Wednesday and was immediately sent for an MRI scan

Upset: The 27-year-old is having meniscus surgery on Thursday and could miss up to six weeks

Main man: Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani will have the task of firing the South Americans to glory

Luis Suarez: (77 caps, 38 goals)

Edinson Cavani: (60 caps, 20 goals)

Diego Forlan: (107 caps, 36 goals)

Christian Stuani: (66 caps, 13 goals)

Abel Hernandez: (11 caps, 7 goals)

However, she believes the Liverpool star will be ready for the World Cup.

'The problem is that these days he won't be able to play, and will only be able to do physiotherapy,' she said.

'He underwent a magnetic resonance and it came out that he had to undergo surgery. It was that quick.'

On the injury, an Uruguay FA official said: ‘It was all unexpected. The latest information is that we 
are deciding what to do, but there are increased possibilities 
(involving surgery).

'I can’t tell you anything more. The AUF (Uruguay 
Federation) will announce it officially on Thursday morning.’

Suarez was
 checked over by medical staff on Wednesday after picking up the knock 
in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in Brazil.

With the final 23-man World Cup squad needed to be ratified on June 2, it leaves Uruguay with very little wriggle room.

Any decision to include Suarez - not match fit - would still represent a sizeable risk.

They
 won't be encouraged to know that Fernando Torres underwent meniscus 
surgery prior to the 2010 World Cup in April and didn't play his first 
game for seven weeks.

Should
 Suarez be out for longer, it would heavily impact on Liverpool's start 
to the next campaign. The Reds are aware of the injury but haven't been 
officially informed.

The 27-year-old arrived in Montevideo for training on Tuesday morning, feeling discomfort in a session with Oscar 
Tabarez's squad on Wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem 
later in the evening.

Roberto
 Pastoriza, executive of the Uruguayan Football Association, confirmed 
that they had attempted to keep the news under wraps.

Golden boot: Suarez was the Premier League top scorer and won the PFA Player of the Year award

Developments
 heap more pressure on Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani, who will 
lead the line when they face Costa Rica on June 14.

Veteran
 Diego Forlan - so impressive in South Africa four years ago - was 
expected to play a bit-part role but may now be needed alongside Cavani.

They do still have other options, with Espanyol's Christian Stuani and Palermo's Abel Hernandez waiting in the wings.

Since
 Suarez signed for Liverpool in January 2011, he has not missed a single
 match because of fitness issues and has been regularly hailed by his 
team-mates and manager for his extraordinary durability and 
determination – he will always make himself available for training, even
 if he is carrying the type of slight tweak that would convince others 
to spend time in the medical room.

Should
 Suarez be prevented from leading the 2010 semi-finalists in Brazil, he 
would be left distraught. The last time there was a major tournament in 
South America, the 27-year-old was the star of the show as Uruguay won 
the Copa America in 2011.
