McDonalds will give free coffee to customers across Northern California as of January 2

Branches of McDonalds in Northern California are to give away free cups of coffee to 'offer a helping hand at the start of the new year'.

From January 2, all local branches of the fast food chain throughout Northern California will offer a free small Premium Roast Coffee with no purchase necessary.

McDonalds say the initiative is a way of saying 'thank you', and to give customers a helping hand in the new year.

Steven Ramirez, a local McDonaldâ€™s restaurant owner from Elk Grove, said: 'In this challenging economic climate, we know that many are struggling to make ends meet and this is our way of lending support during these difficult times.

'As the holiday season comes to a close and budgets become tight, we hope this program will offer some comfort to our community and also warm them up a little during this cold, winter season.

McDonalds' free coffee programme will last for two weeks across 14 counties in Northern California.

The programme is not the first time McDonalds has given away free coffee to customers in American.

In Apil, the chain gave coffee away to diners at its Western Washington drive-through locations for two weeks.

The participating counties are: Sacramento, Placer, Nevada, Sutter, Yuba, Yolo, El Dorado (not including S. Lake Tahoe restaurants), Solano (not including restaurants west of Fairfield), San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Amador, Calaveras, Tuolumne and Colusa.
