Aadil Asghar, 25, has been jailed at Reading Crown Court for five-and-a-half years after killing 12-year-old schoolboy Harsh Dharmendra while racing down a bus lane in Reading

A motorist who knocked down and killed a schoolboy has been jailed for five and a half years.

Aadil Asghar, 25, was driving above the speed limit and in a bus lane in Reading, Berkshire, when Harsh Dhamedra, 12, was crossing the road.

Harsh was on a crossing at the time of the collision but the lights were not working and he was thrown 10ft into the air as a result of the impact.

Asghar had previously crashed his car just yards from where he hit Harsh and also had convictions for using a bus lane and speeding.

Before hitting Harsh, Asghar was seen weaving in and out of traffic while prosecutor Alan Blake said he was driving in the high 40s in a 30mph zone.

Today Asghar was also banned from driving for five years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving on February 21 last year.

Mr Blake said: ‘The decision to drive in the bus lane
and to drive in the high 40s, as opposed to the speed limit of 30mph, 
must have been a deliberate decision to ignore the rules of the road,’ 
said Alan Blake, prosecuting.

Oscar
del Fabro, mitigating, told the court that young father Asghar was 
‘responsible’, and that the impact that the death of Harsh had on him 
was ‘enormous.’

‘He has displayed genuine remorse regarding the circumstances of his actions,’ he said.

Mr del Fabro said that Asghar had remained at the scene and had shown concern for Harsh.

The judge told Aadil Asgharhe had been irresponsible, impatient, reckless and selfish when his car hit Harsh Dharmendra

However, the court was told that at 
the scene Asghar had insisted that he was driving at no more than 30mph,
and had entered the bus lane much closer to the collision point than 
was the case.

He admitted to causing death by careless driving but was convicted of the higher charge by a jury which took two hours to reach its decision after a five-day trial.

Judge John reprimanded Asghar, from Reading, for not taking care when he saw that the traffic lights were not working and said he was driving at such a speed that there was ‘no chance’ of him stopping to avoid Harsh.

Bearded Asghar, who wore a blue suit, held his head in his hands as Judge John told him that he would be going to prison.

‘By the jury's verdict there was one cause and one alone which accounted for this accident,’ said Judge John.

‘It was the heedless way in which you drove.

‘Going into the bus lane was not, as you claimed, so as to avoid inconveniencing other drivers: it was simply selfish.

'Your speed can, on no basis, be excused.

‘In your own words in a letter you have written to me, you were irresponsible, impatient, reckless and selfish in your actions, by which you created a danger which had dire consequences.

'You thought only of yourself and by your actions you ended the life of a young boy.'
