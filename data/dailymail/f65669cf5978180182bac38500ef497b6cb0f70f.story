A severe flood warning has been issued as forecasters say up to a month’s rain could fall in just 24 hours.

The Environment Agency is urging communities in the north and east of England, the Midlands and much of Wales to be prepared for flooding as two bands of very heavy rain are set to cross the UK tomorrow and into Saturday.

The agency said the risk of flooding was expected to be the highest of a so-far wet year with properties and transport in some parts of the country likely to be hit.

Anticipation: As forecasters predict heavy rain in parts England over the next 24 hours flooding is already causing problems for drivers in parts of Scotland

The areas likely to be most severely hit late tomorrow are Yorkshire, the North East, the Midlands and East Anglia, the Environment Agency said.

Craig Woolhouse, head of flood incident management at the Environment Agency, said: 'We are expecting some very significant flooding in the coming days across large parts of the country, and would strongly urge people to sign up to flood warnings, keep a close eye on the forecasts for their area and be prepared for flooding.

'We would also ask that people stay safe, by keeping out of dangerous flood water and not attempting to walk or drive through it.

Washout: The Environment Agency has urged communities in the north and east of England, the Midlands and much of Wales to be prepared for flooding as two bands of heavy rain are set to cross the UK tomorrow and Saturday

'The Environment Agency has already opened incident rooms and has teams out on the ground checking on flood defences and clearing any blockages in order to reduce the risk of flooding as much as possible.'

The Met office say that over the next three days the weather will remain unsettled with scattered, slow moving showers across the UK.

Thunderstorms are likely in the east and southwest in particular, with some persistent heavy rain in the north

Nick Prebble, a forecaster with Meteogroup, the Press Association’s weather division, said one indication was that up to 100mm (3.9 inches) could fall over central and southern England in a 24 hour period but it was likely to be less.

He said: 'There is quite a large area of rain edging in from south-east England and making its way westwards through the course of tomorrow.

'Much of England and Wales will be affected by rain.'

The Met Office issued an amber weather warning - the second highest, and meaning 'be prepared'.

Tony Waters, deputy chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'We are expecting spells of very heavy and thundery rain across a wide area of the UK in the next few days, with worst affected spots likely to be in central and northern parts of the country.

'Rainfall totals could be 20-40mm 
widely across warning areas, but some places could see around 100mm of 
rain through Friday and into Saturday.

'Given
the saturated ground from the record rainfall in June, this could cause
significant disruption - including difficult driving conditions and 
flooding in some areas.'

Parts of Co Down in Northern Ireland were flooded today and Down District Council declared an emergency in the area.

Newcastle SDLP councillor Carmel O’Boyle said flood water was 'several feet deep' in some areas of the town.

Last month was the wettest June since records began, with double the average rain falling during the month.

Provisional
figures from the Met Office showed the UK received 145.3mm (5.7 inches)
in June, beating the previous record of 136.2mm (5.4 inches) in June 
2007.

It was the second 
month this year to see record-breaking amounts of rain, after this April
became the wettest in the records dating back more than a century to 
1910.

June saw long, prolonged rainfall and 
short but exceptionally heavy showers, and ended with freak storms which
battered areas of the Midlands and the North East.

The exceptional amount of rain caused floods in Wales and parts of England.
