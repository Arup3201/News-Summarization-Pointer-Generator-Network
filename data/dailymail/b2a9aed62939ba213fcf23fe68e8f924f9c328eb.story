I've wanted Rapunzel's hair from the age of five, and I want it just as much now, at the age of 27. Not just long hair, but endless tumbling waves that fall heavy over my shoulders and constantly get in the way with all their weighty glory.

In the past, I've had extensions which always tended to look a bit straggly, and very obviously alien to the rest of my locks. And, I reasoned, if even the minted likes of Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears can't seem to get them right, then maybe no amount of money can buy that sort of hair.

But one New York-based hair guru, Angelo David, claims to have mastered a 'couture' method so streamlined that Rapunzel hair really can be yours, and with not a single tell-tale sign of its fakery.

With a stubborn dose of skepticism, I put my head of average-length hair in his hands and waited for a follicular miracle.

Mr David has been in the business for more than 20 years, long before extensions really got popular, and is widely hailed these days as 'the Vera Wang of hair extensions.'

He sources human locks from around the world and runs his own 'hair laboratory', where technicians match the color, the texture and the shape of every strand of hair to the samples he takes from his clients.

Prices range from $500 to $4,000 and depend entirely on the type, color and amount of hair you want. Mine - 18 inches of premium European hair - are worth an eye-watering $3,600.

Painstaking: The segments were fused to tiny sections of my hair and secured with thin metal 'micro-rings' bit-by-bit, layer-by-layer (pictured)

Hidden: Mr David steered clear of the sections too close to my hair line so that I'd be able to tie my hair up without the rings being visible (pictured)

Ta-da! The process took a lengthy five hours to complete, after which I was treated to a 'shaping' trim and a blowout (pictured)

First came my consultation, during which I explained what I wanted in forensic detail - 'Rapunzel hair... literally, literally, Rapunzel hair' - while he tossed my mane around and took sneaky snippings as he went.

It's important, Mr David says, to take samples from the front, the back, the top and the underneath of the hair, because most of us have different textures in different areas.  I'd never noticed this before, but it is definitely true.

Then we discussed the sort of wave I wanted, because apparently there are a plethora of those too. I opted for a 'loose S' variety. Finally, I was politely informed that my color was drab, and was whisked off to have it corrected by his colorist.

It took a week for Mr David's lab team to prepare the hair, after which I was called in for my marathon application session.

Volume: Mr David, a huge fan of 'voluptuous locks', ruffles and coils my hair as I seemingly ponder the meaning of human existence

Hair today, gone tomorrow: It's recommended I return within two to four months, depending on how I'm doing, to have the extensions removed 

Options: Personally I prefer a reasonably natural finish (left) but if the urge ever does strike me, glossy ringlets can be mine too (right)

The two ponytails Mr David presented me with were made up from hundreds of minute individual threads of hair, bonded at their 'roots'. The more of them they are, he says, the better they will blend in with my own hair.

Next, after my hair was washed and dried thoroughly, it was time for the painstaking process of attaching someone else's locks - whomever they may be - to my own, which was always going to be a weird feeling.

The segments were fused to tiny sections of my hair and secured with thin metal 'micro-rings' bit-by-bit, layer-by-layer. 

Mr David steered clear of the sections too close to my hair line so that I'd be able to tie my hair up without the rings being visible.

It took five hours, but I was plied with a selection of beverages and kept comfortable throughout. 

Then and now: The extensions when I first had them done (left) and three months on, without styling (right)

Once Mr David had finished, great hunks of thick hair reached my elbows, which felt heavenly but definitely looked wig-like.

The final step, 'the shaping', he assured me, was the most important. Off he set in the manor of Edward Scissorhands, hacking into my extremely long hair so that it fell into subtle layers leaving tendrils scattered on the floor.

True to his word, the finished result post-blowout - if a little coiffed and 'overdone' for my liking - was impressive.

My hair was unfeasibly long and thick, and very much felt like my own.

For two nights following the procedure, sleeping was excruciatingly painful; how it might feel to have hundreds of little goblins  yanking incessantly on small chunks of your hair.

Entirely normal, I hear.

Pitfalls: Lindsay Lohan (left and right) tends to have extensions that fail to blend in  with her own hair, particularly color-wise

On show: Britney Spears (left) has long been a wearer of blonde extensions, but often has them fitted too high-up and close to her hairline, as does Paris Hilton (center) and Amanda Bynes (right)

Once the pain subsided, and after I'd washed my hair, I truly fell in love with the results. The extensions hang naturally, they're not poker straight nor artificially wavy, and they move with my own hair.

I barely have to touch them with a styling implement to make them feel nice. In fact, I think they look best completely natural, which far from being high-maintenance like extensions I've had in the past, saves me a boatload of time and hassle.

Mr David recommends I return within two to four months, depending on how I'm doing, to have them removed. Any longer and the hair grows too far out from the roots and gets tangled above the micro-rings.

Getting it right: Sarah Jessica Parker's extensions match her natural hair perfectly (left) and Kate Beckinsale is rarely without hers, which are thick and luxurious (right)

Faithful falsies: Alessandra Ambrosio  wouldn't dream of charging down the Victoria's Secret runway without her wavy extensions in (left), and Blake Lively has been a fan of hers for years (right)

Great lengths: Keira Knightley once rather successfully lengthened her locks (left) from a previously short, boyish cut, while Rihanna often appears with sudden fountains of wavy hair (right)

For between $350 and $450, you can have the extensions re-applied when the time comes. 

If you opt for this, the salon removes them, washes and freshens up your natural hair and then reapplies them exactly as before, using new micro-rings, as well as throwing a few new sections in for volume.

This can be done between two and four times in total, due to shedding over time, meaning that the most you get out of them is nine to 12 months.

These extensions may be far from cheap, or be quite long enough for a prince to clamber up them, but the feeling of having locks long enough to fall into my soup, flop onto my keyboard, and genuinely get in my way feels exactly as good as I always hoped it would.
