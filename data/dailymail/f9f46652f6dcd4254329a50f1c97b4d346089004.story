A German woman has started transporting her two-foot tall miniature horse in the boot of her Smart Car after finding it impossible to safely secure him in a horse box.

Kim Scholz, 23, said she had been stopped by police several times while driving in her hometown of Koenigsbrunn in Bavaria, but has always been able to prove that four-year-old Sammy - who is about as tall as a medium-sized dog - is properly secured.

The University of Augsburg student said she was forced to adopt unorthodox methods to transport the Argentinian Falabella after realising he was far safer in the boot of her car than in a full-sized horse box, where he is too small to be suitably fastened.

Taken for a ride: Sammy - a four-year-old Argentinian Falabella - has to travel in the boot of his owner's Smart car because he is too small to travel in a normal-sized horse box

Unusual: Sammy's owner Kim Scholz (pictured in white) said she was forced to adopt unorthodox methods to transport him after realising he was far safer in the boot of her car than in a horse box

Cute: The four-year-old stallion is an Argentinian Falabella - one of the smallest breeds of horse in the world

Ms Scholz contacted local media to explain her reasons for transporting Sammy in the back of her black Smart Car after photographs started appearing in national media.

She felt she needed to explain that not only was Sammy traveling in the boot for his own safety, it was also a perfectly legal way of transporting an animal of his size.

'I have actually been stopped several times by the police, but once they see that Sammy is properly secured in the back of the car and in fact that he seems to be quite enjoying it in there, they always let me carry on,'Â Ms Scholz said.

'In the horse box it is not possible to properly secure him because he is so small, and he only has a white wall to look at which is nowhere near as interesting as having a window in the car,' she added.

Entertainer: Two-foot tall Sammy now routinely travels in the back of a Smart car whenever he needs to travel to perform in a show or an event

Adorable: Ms Scholz adopted Sammy two years ago after seeing him advertised on the internet

Bad fit: Ms Scholz started transporting her two-foot tall miniature horse in the boot of her Smart Car after realising he was too small secure properly in a normal horse box. It also allows him to look out the window

Ms Scholz said Sammy now routinely travels in the back of her Smart Car whenever he needs to travel to perform in a show or an event.

'It is particularly practical for short journeys just to put him in the boot,' she said.

Ms Scholz adopted Sammy two years ago after seeing him advertised on the internet.

He
 had been badly treated and underfed by a previous owner and required a 
lot of extra care and attention to become calm enough to perform at 
local horse shows.

Trot: Despite the fact they seldom grow much taller than a medium-sized dog  Argentinian Falabellas are classed as horses, not ponies. Because they are so small, they are not suitable for riding

What a sight! Kim Scholz felt she needed to explain that not only was Sammy traveling in the boot for his own safety, it was also a perfectly legal way of transporting an animal of his size

Despite the fact they seldom grow much taller than a medium-sized dog Falabellas are horses, not ponies.

Although the difference between the two is usually based on height, the actual definition is in fact based on phenotypes - the physical characteristics and temperament of the animal.

In short, despite being smaller than many ponies, the character and physicality of an Argentinian Falabella has far more in common with a horse, and they are therefore defined as such.

Because they are so small, Argentinian Falabellas are not suitable for riding.

They are, however, highly intelligent and are occasionally used as an alternative to a guide dog for blind people.
