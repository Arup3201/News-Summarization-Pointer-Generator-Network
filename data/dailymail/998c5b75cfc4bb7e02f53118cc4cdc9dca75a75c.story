A comic known for dressing as an old woman on a popular Spanish TV show is to be jailed for 10 years after being found guilty of possessing child pornography.

Adonis Losada, 49, used to appear on the popular Spanish-language TV variety show 'Sábado Gigante' on Univision.

The comic originally faced 66 child pornography charges, many involving graphic images of young children in sexual situations, but in the end he was only tried on four counts after 62 were tossed.

He told judge that he knew what he did was wrong, and that he was going to prison.

Jailed: Former Sábado Gigante star Adonis Losada at his sentencing Friday on child porn charges told the judge that he knew what he did was wrong, and that he was going to prison

Reduced: Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Karen Miller on Friday sentenced Losada to 10 years in prison on four counts of child pornography after tossing 62 of the 66 counts on which he was being tried

Self-defense: Losada stubbornly refused to used a lawyer in his trial and maintained his own defense. It seems to have paid off as 62 of the charges were dropped

Justice: Adonis Losada, the 49-year-old former comic actor from the popular Spanish-language TV show Sábado Gigante, was tried on 66 counts of child pornography from September 2009

During his trial, Losada offered no defense and refused to use an attorney in court.

He faced a minimum of 47 years and a maximum of 330 years in prison before the majority of the charges were dropped.

Losada told Circuit Judge Karen Miller that he understood the serious nature of his child 
pornography charges, and asked her to consider the maximum sentence of 
20 years.

'It's not a petty offense,' he said through an interpreter.

Losada will get credit for just more than 4 1/2 years of jail time already served.

Funny man: Losada was famous for his character, Doña Concha, on the long-running Univisión variety show Sábado Gigante

Before the trial got underway at the start of this year, Losada turned down a plea deal for a sentence of 20 years. At the time, he was facing the possibility of 330 years in jail.

Assistant State Attorney Gregory Schiller asked for the 20-year maximum.

However, just
 before announcing the sentence, Miller threw out some charges of 
transmission and possession of child pornography.

She said her interpretation of the law required 
Losada to be charged for the actual times he transmitted and accessed 
child pornography, not for how many images he had.

Miller
 said because Losada was caught transmitting images only twice and 
caught with images twice by police, he should face only two counts of 
transmission and two counts of possession.

Losada was first arrested in September
 2009 after connecting online with a Boynton Beach police detective 
posing as a bilingual, bisexual adult male in a chat room for people 
interested in having sex with children.

The room was called '#baby@todderlove,' according to court records.

Losada was famous for his character, Doña Concha, on the long-running Univisión variety show 'Sábado Gigante.'

The gig ended with his arrest.

Freedom curtailed: Losada faced 66 child pornography charges but in the end was only tried on 4. Over the years he's been transferred back and forth between jails in Florida

Losada,
 who has consistently refused to be appointed a lawyer.

During the trial he told a judge multiple times that he understood his constitutional 
rights, and he rambled incoherently about the U.S. Constitution when 
given a chance to speak.

The prosecutor in the case, Schiller, said he respects the judge's 
decision to give Losada 10 years, but was disappointed he didn't receive
 more time because of the severity of the images he possessed.

'Idon't think any time less than the maximum — I don't think any 
probationary period is going to rehabilitate Mr. Losada,' he said. 'In all my years of doing these kinds of cases, I've never seen images [of children] this young, or so horrible and heinous.'
