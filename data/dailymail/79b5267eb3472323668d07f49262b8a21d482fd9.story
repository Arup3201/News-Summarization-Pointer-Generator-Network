Comedian Al Murray has revealed he plans to stand for Parliament at the general election  - against Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

The 'Pub Landlord' said he will stand in Thanet South, Kent, for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party.

Explaining his decision to stand, The Pub Landlord said: 'It seem to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions.'

The 'Pub Landlord' said he will stand in Thanet South, Kent, for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party

His comment will not be lost on many of those familiar with Mr Farage who is often pictured during impromptu lunchtime photocalls with a drink in his hand in a pub.

Oxford-educated Murray has created an action plan in the guise of his patriotic character, in which he promises: 'I pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 and the edge of the Solar System by 2050. Common Market sense.

'In the meantime Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.'

In a video posted online he explained: 'Let it be known that like many of the Parliamentary hopefuls in the forthcoming election, I have no idea where South Thanet is - but did that stop Margaret Thatcher from saving the Falkland Islands? No.'

Murray, 46, is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010.

It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there as UKIP experiences a surge of support and now has two Parliamentary seats. His party took 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago.

The Pub Landlord took a dig at Mr Farage, explaining his decision to stand. He said: 'It seem to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions'

Mr Farage's team appeared unconcerned about the threat posed by The Pub Landlord. A spokesman for the Ukip leader said: 'At last, serious competition in the constituency'

CURRENCY

The pound will be revalued at £1.10, so it will now be worth 10p more.

NHS 

If you come to A&E and it's neither an accident nor an emergency, then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on.

FOREIGN POLICY 

Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying.

IMMIGRATION 

The reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse.

EUROPE

Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.

LAW AND ORDER

Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed.

A website he has set up for his campaign, carries the slogan: 'Other parties offer the moon on a stick. We'll do better than that: a British moon on a British stick.'

His decision to stand comes two years after fellow comic Simon Brodkin - known for his character Lee Nelson - handed in nomination papers to stand in a by-election at South Shields, for David Miliband's former seat. He went on to withdraw later the same day.

Other proposals include his pledge on law and order: 'Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed. Common sense.'

And on the hot topic of immigration, he says: 'Of course the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world.

The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. Look no further.

'However, in the meantime, we brick up the Channel Tunnel. With British bricks. Probably have to get some Poles in to do it. Common sense.'

In his online address, Murray explains: 'The reason I'm standing is because the system is broken, we all know it is. You hear people saying 'you shouldn't vote'. Well you should vote boys and girls, you should vote for me.'

He also promises '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'.

The party's logo features an upturned pound sign, in a clear parody of the UKIP symbol.
