Incredible footage has emerged of two 
oil workers running for cover as they try to avoid being caught up in a tornado as 
it swept through a trailer park.

Dan Yorgason began filming as the vortex touched down in an oil field south of Watford City, North Dakota, on Monday.

The massive twister injured nine people, severely damaged 
15 trailers and ruined equipment at the Bakken Oilfield, about 
five miles outside the city.

The pair flee to their pickup truck, but keep the camera rolling as the twister continues on its path of destruction

As
 the tornado approaches in the distance, alarms begin to sound in the trailer park and Yorgason shouts: 'It's about to go right over us.'

He adds: 'We've got nowhere to go. It's heading right for us. I don't want to be sitting here.'

One of the pair then grab the keys to their pickup truck so they can take refuge in the front seats.

Sat in the cabin, they watch as the tornado carries on its path of destruction alongside the vehicle.

'I don't know where it's going': The vortex appears to stop as the pair are in the cabin of the vehicle

With the windows to the vehicle open, they start shouting: 'Look at everybody just running.'

The vortex then appears to stop next to the vehicle and the pair say: 'It's just sitting there.

'I can't tell which way it's going. It looks like it's breaking apart.'

Baseball-sized hail fell during the storm and the tornado was on the ground for an entire minute, witnesses said.

A woman who captured another video of 
the vortex can be heard repeatedly praying and saying 'we've got nowhere
 to go' as a man in the background kept shouting to people that a 
tornado was coming.

The desperation and panic in her voice is haunting.

One
 witness posted to Facebook that the twister started on a Hess oil 
field, but MailOnline was not able to independently confirm.

The critically injured person is currently being treated in a local hospital, officials said. The other eight were treated and released.

An initial report by KXMB suggested a trailer with four children in it had gone missing, but all people were later accounted for, officials said.

A shelter was set up for people whose homes have been destroyed, an official told In Forum. Of the 15 trailers damaged, 15 were completely destroyed, KFYR reported.  

Devastating: A total of 15 trailers housing oilfield workers were destroyed, eight entirely

Destroyed: About half of the 15 trailers damaged by the twister were completely destroyed

'Oh my Jesus': The woman who took this video is heard desperately 
praying over and over again for safety from the terrifying tornado

William Bunkel, who works for a 
trucking company, said that he was in Watford City with some co-workers 
when the tornado warning came. They had just moved their vehicles inside
 because of large hail when they spotted the funnel cloud.

"We saw it form, come out of the sky, hit the ground and go back up into the clouds," he said.

Bunkel, 38, took photos of the twister and estimated that it remained on the ground for nearly a minute. He said he couldn't see any debris.

'It was a little bit too far away. We just saw the clouds and the rotation,' he said.

The tornado warning for the area
 was later lifted, but McKenzie County emergency management officials were 
asking people to stay off the roads because emergency vehicles were 
having a difficult time reaching the scene.

The oil boom has fueled a population boom for the area, bringing in tens of thousands of people looking for work.

Many live in hastily-assembled trailer parks or man camps, which contain pre-fabricated structures that can resemble military barracks.

Some companies rent blocks of hotel rooms for employees to live in, and some workers sleep in their cars or even tents.

Housing developments are constantly popping up in big areas of town that didn't exist on maps a couple of years ago.

But they are still not enough to keep pace with demand and oil money has pushed rents to among the highest in the nation, even rivaling trendy neighborhoods in the country's largest cities.

A simple one bedroom apartment in the oil boom hub city of Williston can easily cost $2,000 per month in rent. Even a spot to park a trailer can cost over $800 per month.

Watford City, is about 30 miles southeast of Williston.
