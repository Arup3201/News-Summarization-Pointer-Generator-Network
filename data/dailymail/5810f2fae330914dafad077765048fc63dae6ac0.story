Manchester United star Adnan Januzaj has received death threats over his decision to play for Belgium, according to reports in Serbia.

The 19-year-old qualified to represent Serbia, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo and even England in the future, but opted for the country of his birth in April, making his official debut against Tunisia just a week before the World Cup kicked off in Brazil.

Reports on Serbian radio station S Media and in Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad claim that Januzaj has been the target of death threats from Kosovan-Albanians angry at his decision to turn his back on them.
