show De Zurda Maradona, who was handed a 15-month ban from football during the 1994 World Cup for testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine, wore a t-shirt with the message 'Luisito Estamos
 Con Vos,' which means 'Little Luis we are with you.'

The 53-year-old, who captained his 
country to World Cup glory in 1986, reportedly likened Suarez's ban to 
sending him to the notorious Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp.

Speaking
 on the show he is quoted as saying: 'The FIFA sanction is shameful, they have no sensitivity towards the fans, they might as well handcuff him and throw him in Guantanamo.

'The sanction on Luis is a way of punishing Uruguayan clubs for asking CONMEBOL (the South American confederation) for a fairer share of money.

'It hurts that they have cut short the career of a lad who is a winner. It's an excessive suspension, FIFA cannot talk about morals to anyone.'

The former Barcelona, Napoli and Boca Juniors forward added: 'Suarez didn't kill anyone. This is an unjust punishment, the act of an incredible mafia.'

On
 Thursday, FIFA banned Suarez from all football for four months and the 
next nine Uruguay games after his bite on Chiellini as well as a fine of
 Â£64,000.

The world governing body has come down 
hard on the controversial Liverpool forward who now faces an extended 
spell on the sidelines following his third charge for biting offences.

The Liverpool star will be unavailable for actin until October 26. His first game after suspension could be a fourth round Capital One Cup tie on October 28/29 if the Reds progress to that round.
