A sex offender who had a record dating back 50 years was caught on CCTV spending eight hours trawling around a Toys R Us before targeting a seven-year-old girl.

Leslie Foster was seen loitering around the aisles of the shop in Preston, Lancashire, before approaching the girl when she became separated from her father and brother. 

The 63-year-old had been released from prison just a year before the attack in February this year. He was freed after serving 34 years of a life sentence for raping a teenager at knifepoint in 1978.  

Foster sneaked up behind the young girl as she was looking for a doll to buy with her birthday money. 

He exposed himself and told her that he would buy her any toy she wanted if she showed him her underwear.

The girl ran away and was found sobbing in another aisle by store staff, whom she told of the encounter. 

Foster was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison at Preston Crown Court today after he admitted causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

The victim’s father said in a statement that he was now 'very concerned about letting his children out of sight in public' and said that he 'wanted to kill' the man.

He said: 'It happened in 30 seconds. My children wanted to look at different aisles. I was walking from the skateboard aisle to check on her when I heard the Tannoy calling me.

'My daughter was in tears and the staff told me what had happened. I shouted and shouted for my son because I was afraid the man was still in the store. I was relieved it hadn’t been any worse.

'It doesn’t seem to have affected her too much luckily, but it may do when she’s older. It’s really affected us. 

'Since it happened I am on pins when I’m out with them, I never let them out of my sight.'

CCTV footage revealed that Foster had come in and out of the store in Deepdale Retail Park on five separate occasions on the day of the attack. 

He was seen wearing a hat and glasses on some of the visits, which police believe was done to try and alter his appearance. 

He was caught after a probation officer recognised pictures of Foster when they appeared in a local newspaper.

It emerged he had a record for sex offences dating back to 1966, when, then aged 15, he attacked and molested a 32-year-old woman while she was pushing a pram. He appeared in court but was later released on probation.

In that same year, Foster molested an eight-year-old girl who he saw walking alone - and was once again released on probation. 

The following year he was sent to a secure mental hospital after he beat up and threatened to rape a 76-year-old woman on her own doorstep.

But in May 1978 he struck again while he was still a psychiatric patient at Whittingham Hospital in Preston. 

He had been allowed out with an escort to attend a motor mechanic’s college course but targeted a 19-year-old girl when he saw her get off a bus while he was travelling back to the hospital.

Foster followed her and dragged her into a shed where he raped her at knifepoint. 

He was caught after two boys saw him fleeing the scene and followed him back to the hospital. 

When Foster was caught he told hospital staff: 'I’ll say I did it to get you off my back. You’re always at me. I’ll be better off inside. Let the State keep me.'

CCTV footage revealed that Foster had come in and out of the store in Deepdale Retail Park, pictured above, on five separate occasions on the day of the attack in February

He was given life imprisonment after he was convicted of rape but was released on 13 December 2012.  

An expert who questioned Foster after his most recent attack concluded that he was either 'unable or unwilling to control sexualised behaviour' and posed 'a significant risk of serious harm to the public'. 

Paul Cummings, prosecuting, said: 'Foster was first seen in the shop at 9.36am and this offence was committed around 4.15pm. We know from the footage he had been seen in the entrance entering the shop on at least four or five occasions.

'The impression was that he changed his appearance as he has gone in and out, sometimes he was wearing a woolen hat, sometimes he wasn’t, also glasses as well. 

'The impression the police had was that he was trying to make his appearance look different.' 

Foster gave himself up when police were given his name. The victim identified him as her attacker after watching the CCTV. She is now said to be 'frightened' about going about on her own.

In mitigation defence counsel Miss Jo Shepherd said: 'Having spent virtually all his adult life in custody, Mr Foster is quite institutionalised.' 

But passing sentence Judge Michael Byrne said: 'The defendant chose a place deliberately that children go to, a toy shop. 

'CCTV footage records him as giving the impression that he is wandering around the shop looking for children to approach.

'In the circumstances I’m satisfied this conduct clearly demonstrates a significant degree of planning. 

‘This court takes the view in this case that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm.'
