Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has accused the education secretary Michael Gove of  ‘misquoting’ a Cambridge University professor in the row about how hit show Blackadder portrays the First World War.

Mr Paxman said he supported the idea of showing the programme to encourage pupils to talk about the war ahead of its 100th anniversary.

His comments come after Mr Gove wrote an article in the Daily Mail criticising historians and TV programmes, which he said denigrated patriotism and courage by depicting the war as a ‘misbegotten shambles’.

Mr Gove accused Cambridge historian professor Sir Richard Evans of being a left-wing academic who was happy to ‘feed the myth’ perpetuated by programmes such as Blackadder.

Speaking at a preview of his new BBC1 series, Britain’s Great War, Mr Paxman said he had no problem with the Rowan Atkinson show being used to encourage schoolchildren to talk about the war, ‘as long as it was not taught as fact. It’s not fact. It was a brilliant comedy.’

On Mr Gove, he added: ‘I think he wilfully misquoted Richard Evans, the Cambridge historian, and rather unfairly I think.’

Mr Paxman said he had no problem with the Rowan Atkinson show being used to encourage schoolchildren to talk about the war - 'as long as it was not taught as fact. It's not fact. It was a brilliant comedy'

He said that many people’s understanding of the war was that ‘this whole thing was a disaster foisted upon people by a governing class which had no instinctive understanding of the plight of ordinary people’.

‘I do not believe that to be the case,’ he said. ‘If you read the accounts of ordinary soldiers, it seems to me in the early stages of the war there was a conviction that the war was a justified enterprise.

‘Michael Gove uses this phrase a “just war”. I don’t really want to get into the theology of a just war because I don’t really understand it, but I’m not sure it’s a really helpful phrase. But an understandable war, yes.’
