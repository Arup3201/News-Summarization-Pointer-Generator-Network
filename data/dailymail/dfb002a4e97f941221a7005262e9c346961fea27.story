Jose Mourinho has said Holland international Arjen Robben ‘tries to get an advantage’ by winning free-kicks and penalties when he plays.

The attacker has come under fire for the number of times he appealed for a penalty during Holland’s win over Mexico on Saturday.

It was a spot-kick that won Holland the game, after the referee Pedro Proenca adjudged Rafael Marquez to have clipped Robben inside the Mexico box.

‘He was my player and I know better than many what a fantastic player he is’, said Mourinho, who coached the Dutch winger at Chelsea.

‘I also know that because of his speed and because of his creativity he is punished a lot with fouls by opponents who cannot stop him,’ the Portuguese boss told Yahoo.

‘I also know that sometimes he tries to get an advantage and he tries to get a free-kick or he tries to get a penalty.

‘I think it’s important for the players to help the referees by being honest on the pitch, to try to win the right way.

‘But the reality is that not every player behaves that way and referees have a difficult job.'

Mourinho added that he thinks video technology is something referees would welcome in the game, to help them make correct decisions when a player might have dived.

‘If you have technology you can have a chance to have a fourth official watching on the video or screen situation.

‘So I think the referee should also be happy to have the chance in case of doubt, the chance to clear every doubt and the chance to make the right decision.

‘When one country feels that one bad decision influences its future in the competition I think it’s hard and I think it’s important for coaches, for players and also referees.

‘I think technology is something the referees would welcome.’
