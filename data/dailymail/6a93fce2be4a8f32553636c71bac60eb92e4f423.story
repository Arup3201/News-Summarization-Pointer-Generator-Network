Detectives are searching a remote Lancashire wood after the killer of a 'Romeo' businessman revealed the location of his body.

'Wheeler dealer' David Guilfoyle, 37, disappeared in May 2005 whilst having an affair with Debbie Fitzpatrick and another woman.

Scorned former husband, factory worker Shane Fitzpatrick, 36, was later convicted of beating Guilfoyle to death and hiding his body.

Search: Police are scouring woods near Bolton by Bowland in Lancashire for the body of David Guilfoyle

Detectives have been joined by army engineers and forensic archaeologists in the search for the body

Searches of waters and woodland at the time - including a search of a reservoir by police divers - proved fruitless.

But
detectives have now renewed the search after Fitzpatrick rang them from
prison to say he had 'found God' and was willing to show them where he 
dumped the body of his former love rival.

Fitzpatrick
was taken from his prison cell at Garth Prison near Leyland to 
Admiral's Wood near Bolton-by-Bowland, Lancashire, where he said he had 
buried Guilfoyle hours after killing him.

Police are scouring the woodland with sniffer dogs and digging up parts of the woodland where Guilfoyle’s body is suspected to be buried.

A keen fell runner, Fitzpatrick had chosen the burial site after running through it during Bowland Harriers fell races.

Detective Superintendent Paul Withers, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'Shane Fitzpatrick has been serving a custodial sentence but never admitted his guilt and never answered questions until recently when he indicated he wanted to speak to us.

Love rivals: Guilfoyle was having an affair with Fitzpatrick's ex-wife Debbie Fitzpatrick

'Two officers visited him at Garth Prison last Friday when he basically admitted his guilt, admitted responsibility for the murder and indicated that the body had been buried in a shallow grave in Admiral’s Wood.

'He expressed remorse for his actions and indicated he had given up the body because it was the right thing to do especially for Mr Guilfoyle’s friends and family. He has had a lot of time to think about things and deeply regrets what he did.

'Fitzpatrick was brought to the scene on Tuesday morning and indicated an area, but it was difficult for him with the passage of time, there has been some logging in the wood, and, of course, it was dark when he buried the body.'

Detective Superintendent Withers added the search involved 25 detectives, crime scene investigators and two forensic archaeologists. They were joined by soldiers from the army’s 33 engineers regiment who were giving advice on signs of ground disruption.

Fitzpatrick was jailed for 20 years in 2005 after Preston Crown Court found him guilty of murder.

The court had heard how Guilfoyle - who had a 15-year-old daughter - was having an affair with Fitzpatrick’s ex-wife Debbie and another woman Adele Walton.

He was said to be 'quite well off' and owned a number of properties which were rented out. He also travelled the world, including Egypt, Brazil and Australia.

Guilfoyle - a championship pool player who represented England in the sport - was also described as a 'wheeler dealer'.

He sold illegally-imported cigarettes on the black market, dealt in pirate DVDs and counterfeit clothing, and kept up to £30,000 in cash in his home. Friends said he had lots of enemies.

Fitzpatrick had married teaching assistant Debbie in 1995 and the couple had three children but their marriage was stormy.

The factory worker was said to have a
'possessive jealousy' towards Debbie, believed she was having an affair
with a work colleague and beat her leaving her with various injuries 
including black eyes and fractured cheekbone.

Debbie
eventually moved out of their home in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire 
and in November 2002, began an affair with Guilfoyle.

Fitzpatrick
sent his former wife text messages saying he did not like Guilfoyle and
in conversations told her: 'You’re mine - he has stolen you off me and I
feel like killing him'.

'Wheeler-dealer': Guilfoyle owned several properties, drove a Jaguar and was said to be involved in black-market clothes, DVDs and cigarettes

Police found blood stains on the drive of Guilfoyle's £230,000 bungalow in Accrington, Lancashire

The Fitzpatricks divorced in August, 2004 but he still harboured feelings for Debbie.

Guilfoyle was last seen alive on May 25 2005 watching Liverpool’s victory in the Champion’s League Final at the Grey Horse pub in Accrington.

He was said to be 'in jubilant mood' but he was reported missing two days later. Police who went to the victim’s £230,000 bungalow found huge bloodstains on the drive.

Guilfoyle’s racing green convertible 
Jaguar XK8 car worth £15,000 was found parked and locked on the drive. 
Letters were found behind the door, a computer still switched on showing
the date May 25th and his bed had not been slept in.

Clothing
was lying around, his wallet, credit cards and PINS were on a bedside 
cabinet and a substantial amount of cash was in the house. His parked 
car was locked but the keys could not be located.

The
court heard Guilfoyle’s blood was found around the house with a large 
heavy bloodstain on the drive. Attempts had been made to clean up the 
scene. Fitzpatrick’s DNA was found on a torch discovered on top of the hose pipe.

Inquiries revealed neighbours had 
spotted Fitzpatrick in the days leading up to Guilfoyle’s disappearance 
dressed in dark clothing and behaving 'like a commando'.

Police
believe he lay in wait at Guilfoyle’s house dressed in dark clothing 
and wearing a balaclava and beat him to death under cover of darkness in
what was described as a 'ferocious assault'.

He cleaned the scene with the hosepipe before hiding the victim’s body at unknown location.

Fruitless: Despite searching local woodlands and reservoirs, police could find no trace of Guilfoyle's body at the time of the killing

After police charged him with murder Fitzpatrick was heard telling his son: 'The worst case is I will get 15 to 20 years if found guilty - but I still reckon I’ve got a good chance of getting off with it'.

Fitzpatrick denied murder but was convicted by a majority verdict of 11-1.

At the time judge Mr Justice David Clarke told him: 'You carried out a carefully planned and professionally executed killing in which he had taken great care to cover his tracks in every direction'.

'You have been successful in concealing the body but you have not been successful in deceiving the astute and attentive jury.'
