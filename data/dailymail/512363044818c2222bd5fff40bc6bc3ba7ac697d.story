'Worried': CBI president Sir Mike Rake criticised politicians who offer 'headline-grabbing policies which sometimes appear aimed at securing votes'

A leading businessman last night launched a thinly-veiled attack on Ed Miliband, warning that an anti-business government would damage the economy and cost jobs.

Sir Mike Rake, president of the CBI and chairman of BT, said the economic recovery is ‘increasingly being exposed to political risk’.

Although he did not identify the Labour leader by name, he criticised politicians who offer ‘headline-grabbing policies which sometimes appear aimed more at securing votes than encouraging investment and job creation’.

He said: ‘Business is increasingly worried about policy interventions such as on energy, banking, tax and land ownership.’

The comments, in a speech at the Lord Mayor’s Trade and Industry Dinner at Mansion House in London, were seen as a clear attack on Mr Miliband’s increasingly Left-wing agenda.

The Labour leader has pledged to freeze household energy bills for 20 months if he becomes Prime Minister in a move that could cost jobs and investment and lead to blackouts.

Mr Miliband has also threatened to split up the banks, reinstate the 50p top rate of tax, raise corporation tax for some of Britain’s biggest employers, and confiscate land off private developers.

The range of policies has sparked panic in boardrooms across the country amid fears that a Labour victory in 2015 would herald the arrival of the most Left-wing and anti-business government since the 1970s.

Sir Mike said it was crucial that private enterprise is encouraged to prosper, create jobs and drive growth in the economy.

‘The business community is a force for good, has created and is creating jobs,’ he said. ‘It’s the only way we can ensure this recovery benefits all.’

Sir Mike praised the current government for ‘sticking to its guns on tackling the deficit’ which hit a record £157.3billion under Labour.

He added: ‘The government has done well in progressing a positive business tax environment and as a result we are much more competitive globally.’

But Sir Mike bemoaned the government’s failure on infrastructure - including the lack of action to increase airport capacity in the south-east of England.

‘We cannot afford further delays,’ he said.

The CBI now expects the economy to 
grow by 2.6 per cent this year following expansion of 1.8 per cent in 
2013 - the best performance since 2007.

Sir Mike said: ‘The UK is doing better. The pace of our economic recovery has surprised us and our near neighbours.’

He urged George Osborne to ‘priorities measures to boost business investment and trade’ in the Budget this month.

‘For
 business investment to flourish we need a pro-enterprise, pro-business 
agenda to allow productivity to increase so that growth will mean an 
actual increase in levels of prosperity for all,’ he said.

The CBI, which represents 240,000 companies across the UK, also flagged Scottish independence as a major risk to the economy.

Sir Mike said: ‘Clearly, the decision about whether or not Scotland becomes independent is a matter for the Scottish voter. But many will want to know, and are indeed now asking, what the effect of independence will be on Scotland’s economy and business environment.

‘It is the CBI’s considered view that the economic effects of independence would be deeply destabilising and create significant uncertainty which is bound to affect investment and jobs.

‘This is why we believe that Scotland and the United Kingdom stand stronger together - and weaker apart - in today’s interconnected and global world.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government’s long term economic plan is working. But the recovery is not yet secure and the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that’s providing economic security for hardworking people.’
