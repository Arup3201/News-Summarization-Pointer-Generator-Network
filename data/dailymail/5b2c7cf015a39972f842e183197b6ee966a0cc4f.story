So I’m single again. I’ve split up with Stephanie Pratt, whom I had been dating for about four months.

The reason for the split is largely down to the fact that we moved far too fast from the dating stage to the living-together stage.

This was partly because Steph is from Los Angeles and I didn't want her to incur the huge costs of living out of hotels in London, but clearly there was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly, which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic.

Whenever any girlfriend comes into a tight group of friends it’s difficult but when they have practically no shared experiences or associations it’s almost impossible for the relationship to thrive – and that is what started to happen with me and Stephanie.

Perhaps if it wasn’t for the cabin fever we suffered in my apartment in Chelsea the relationship might have endured, after all Stephanie is stunning, classy, witty, clever and has a great sense of style – even if it was utilised to veto several of the items of clothing in my wardrobe (see previous weeks’ blogs).

Too much, too soon: 'There was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly, which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic,' explains Spennie

And although viewers of Made in Chelsea may not have seen this side of her towards me on yesterday’s E4 show she is also warm, caring and affectionate, and I do hope we can remain friends.

The boys seemed to receive the news of my split with a stunned silence (or fear) and there was a trademark Made In Chelsea pause when I made the announcement at dinner.

One plus point from the dinner was that even Andy was forced to admit of me, 'I don’t love the guy but you can’t fault him, he always wears a nice suit.'

My mustard coloured suit was certainly a bit of a departure from the rather more sober slate grey numbers the other boys were wearing on the night and before we sat for dinner, we said a quick Latin grace: Benedictus, Benedicat per Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum.

All the Eton boys (Proudlock. Stevie and I) know this well as it is said at every meal at school. It roughly translates to, 'May he who is Blessed bless [this food] through Jesus Christ Our Lord.'

And I know another wise religious passage as well, 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone.' So let’s not judge others (and by others I mean me) too harshly.

All the best, Spencer xxx
