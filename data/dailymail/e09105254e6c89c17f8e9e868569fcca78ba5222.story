A hobbyist gardener has spoken of his anguish after finding out the model village he spent decades painstakingly constructing has crumbled and decayed.

Alan Teague, 59, started his model village outside his home in the Levenshulme suburb of Manchester as a hobby in 1978.

The project, complete with terraced houses, a village bakery and tiny bicycles for the imaginary residents soon became a tourist attraction and hundreds flocked to view it. 

Sad state: The model village in the Levenshulme suburb of Manchester once drew hundreds of tourists

Overgrown: Since the original architect Alan Teague moved in 1993 his models have not been preserved

Heyday: The village, pictured above in the 1980s, was once carefully tended and ringed with flowers

Shop: The village bakery has its own carefully-painted sign and used to boast miniature cakes in the window

Workmanship: Tiny bikes were once parked outside the bakery, with minute electric bulbs in the rooms

Mr Teague's intricate wonderland, featuring tiny paved pathyways, glass-panelled windows and electric lights, was always left open to curious passers-by and became a firm part of the landscape.

But since Mr Teague, a former gardener for Manchester City Council, retired and moved to Devon in 1993, the houses have slumped into decline.

Although the first new owner offered to look after the carefully-built homes, successive rounds of inhabitants have not taken care of the houses, which now sit in a sorry state outside the detached property.  

Mr Teague, 59, from Ilfracombe only realised what a bad state of repair the model properties were in when he went back to Manchester last year.

Recalling the visit, he said: 'I was disappointed to see them in such a bad state and even knocked on the door to say hello to the new owner.'

'When I left the houses were in perfect condition. The first person who bought the house wanted to look after them.

'I didn't think about taking them then because they have been part of that area for so long. They're part of Levenshulme's history. I really enjoyed building and having them.'

Detailed: The rows of terraced houses in Mr Teague's garden were given names, as was the village pub

Intricate: The windows had tiny panes of glass, and paths between the houses were lined with tiny pebbles

Charming: Mr Teague's project began when he was 24, in 1978, and continued for decades

Mr Teague had combined his passions of architecture and horticulture to start the project from drawings back in 1978.

Then 24 and already working as a gardener for Manchester City Council after completing an apprenticeship straight from leaving at 16, Alan decided to give himself a project and a hobby and built his own village using sketched blueprints pencilled out in his attic.

According to the Skyliner blog by 1988 the project was complete, with intricate details such as tiny glass windows which glowed from the real electric lights. The bakery boasted miniature cakes in the windows and there were flowerbeds, and tiny bicycles leaning against a shop window.

One miniature house, a tudor style detached is engraved in the names of Joyce and Sylvia after the names of the mothers of himself and his partner. It was dated 1988 and split into two businesses - one a toy shop and the second a post office and general groceries.

It even had its own pub called The Duchess of York, named after a local children's hospital which has since closed and there was a row of terraced houses named York Terrace.

Mr Teague said: 'I always liked model villages and architecture and if I was clever I would have liked to have been an architect but I ended up having a lovely career in horticulture.

Roofless: The new owner, who declined to comment on the village, has allowed the houses to decay

Careful construction: The thatched roofs of the terraced houses can be seen here in their original form - the tops of the homes are now bare

'I just collected some stones and started my first one in 1978. I did little drawings and did all the woodwork and built on flat stones in the attic then put everything together in the front garden.

'They took about six weeks each. My Dad then wired them all up so each one lit up from a switch in the kitchen and it looked lovely in Winter.

'All the children had grown up with it. There is a school not far from us and everybody used to stop on the way and have a look. It made me feel happy. I have five brothers and two sisters so lots of nieces and nephews who have grown up with it. I did it because I liked seeing other people happy.

'We would have liked to have brought them to Devon but the cost was quite a lot. It's a shame they have fallen into disrepair. If I had lived there I would have repaired them. It was quite the local attraction at the time. It's quite sad to see them as they are now.'

Mr Teague met his partner Nigel, a former head gardener at Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden in Manchester, in 1976. They entered into a civil partnership on December 21, 2005 - the day it became legal.

'Makes me want to cry': Levenshulme residents have mourned the decline of the attraction under new owners

The couple's creative streak was reflected in their garden and also that of their new property in Devon which has also become a tourist attraction as a 4-star venue for holidaymakers to the south coast.

Mr Teague added: 'Seeing the finished product and watching people enjoying it was the best thing. We both worked with the public so we didn't have a problem with them coming into the garden.

'When I left the houses were in perfect condition. The first person who bought the house wanted to look after them. I didn't think about taking them then because they have been part of that area for so long. They're part of Levenshulme's history. I really enjoyed building and having them.'

Lesley Ferguson, 56, a former neighbour, said: 'The miniature houses were lovely and they're part of Levenshulme. I remember them from being little. I used to walk past and look and always wanted to play with them. Two have been demolished since then.

'They were brilliant. Mr Teague always used to keep them well. He would put new roofs on and make sure the windows were ok. As fashions on houses changed he would change the mini ones.

'The people that have them now have really let them go. It makes me want to cry, especially remembering how they used to be. I don't understand. Anyone that has lived around here will know about them.

'They could at least have kept them tidy. If people tried to renovate them I know a lot of people would chip in. Loads of people would love to see them restored to their former glory.'

When approached to discuss the houses, the current tenants at the property declined to comment. A man who answered the door said: 'I don't want to talk about it and don't have to reveal my reasons why.'
