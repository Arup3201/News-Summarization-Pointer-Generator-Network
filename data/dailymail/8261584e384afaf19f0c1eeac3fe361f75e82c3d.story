Caught: Christopher Maffei, 43, surrendered while allegedly attempting to flee with his two children he kidnapped from their mother

A San Francisco Bay Area father has been sentenced to three years in jail for abducting his two young children and taking them away on a stolen yacht.

Christopher Maffei, 43, was sentenced Friday in San Mateo County Superior Court, where he was also ordered to do 16 months of supervision and stay away from his kids until his sentence is served.

With good behavior, Maffei will only spend about nine more months behind bars because of jail time he has served since his arrest, San Mateo County prosecutors said.

Authorities say Maffei took his 2-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter from their South San Francisco home in September and packed them on a 41-foot yacht stolen from an Alameda marina.

Officials say Maffei and the children spent three days on the water before the vessel ran out of gas off the Monterey County shore, where he surrendered to authorities. They kids were not hurt.

Maffei had pleaded no contest in April to one count of child abduction and one count of possession of a stolen boat.

His defense attorney Jeff Boyarsky said Maffei 'realizes it was inappropriate, illegal and not supported by any kind of rational thinking.'

'He wants the rest of the family and the public to know he's sorry for the anguish he caused,' Boyarsky told the San Mateo County Times.

Maffei believed his kids were in danger in part because they were around an aunt with alleged substance abuse problems, but authorities never found any evidence of abuse, Boyarsky said.

Found: Brooklyn, aged three, left, were taken from her mother's home along with her baby brother Devin, aged two, right

Escape: Maffei was found on this stolen sailboat, a white Hunter 41, he had previously shown interest in buying

Maffei is the former boyfriend of the children's mother, Jennifer Hipon. She told reporters that she was at a courthouse filing custody documents when Maffei went to her house and took the children from her elderly mother.

South San Francisco police say that after running off with the children, Maffei drove to the harbor in Alameda and left on the 40-foot sailboat. He sailed the boat out under the Golden Gate Bridge and headed down the coast, police said.

Destination? The children's mother believed Maffei may have been trying to sail towards Mexico where he talked about taking his two children on holiday

San Francisco police said Maffei had 
visited the owner of the stolen yacht with his two children weeks 
earlier ago to ask about buying it.

A fisherman spotted the sailboat off the San Mateo County coast and after a slow-speed chase, the vessel was intercepted.
