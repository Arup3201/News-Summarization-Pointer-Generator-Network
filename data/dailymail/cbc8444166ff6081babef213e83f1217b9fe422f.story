The two convicted murderers who were mistakenly released from a Florida prison with forged paperwork showed up to another prison facility three days later to register as ex-cons, it has been revealed.

Joseph Jenkins, 34, walked out of Franklin
Correctional Institution in Carrabelle, Florida, on September 27 after submitting a forged order from a judge that reduced his sentence from life in prison to time served.

Days later, Charles Walker, also 34, used the same paperwork to get his sentence 'reduced' to time served, as well. He was released on October 8.

The men were so convinced that their 
scheme had worked, they showed up at another correction facility to 
register as ex-cons that had been released into the community.

Now, both men are in the wind. The addresses they gave on their voluntary criminal registration forms were bogus.

A
spokesman said the officer performed a routine warrant check during the
registration, but since the paperwork appeared to be in order, the men 
were allowed to go on their way.

A
Florida judge revealed today that two murderers serving life sentences 
have been released accidentally from prison after forging his signature 
on his letterhead notepaper.

Chief
Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, believes
that the two inmates had outside help in forging the documents.

Judge Perry told the Orlando Sentinel today: 'I strongly believe they had some help. It is unlikely [the documents] were produced by the inmates.'

However he has few leads on who might have falsified the documents and it is unclear how they were filed. Investigations are ongoing.

Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, had his signature forged on fake court documents that led to the early release of two convicted murderers

The court orders appeared legitimate, said Judy Perry,  with the county seal, letterheads and identical formatting to real papers.

Whoever created the documents had 'elementary knowledge', according to the judge.

Walker was serving life for a second-degree murder committed in Orange County in April 1999.

He told investigators at the time that he had intended to frighten 23-year-old Cedric Slater whom he said had been intimidating him. Walker fired three shots, one of which struck Slater and killed him. 

Jenkins was also serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of a father of six in Orlando in September 1998.

Jenkins and his cousin Angelo Pearson had planned a home invasion at the home of Roscoe Pugh, 28. The father of six died from gunshot wounds. 

Pearson is also serving a life sentence at the Wakulla Correctional Institution in Crawfordville.

A desperate manhunt is now underway to find the two escapees who both have extensive criminal histories. At least one of the escaped convicts could be in Orange County because he once lived there.

The Florida Department of Corrections is investigating how authorities were duped by the fake documents.

Spokeswoman Jessica Cary told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I don't know how it happened.'

A search for both inmates on the Florida Department of Corrections website returns the message: 'There was an error retrieving the details about the selected offender.'
