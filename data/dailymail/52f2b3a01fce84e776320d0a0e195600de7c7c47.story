The Monty Python team are set to reunite in a surreal sci-fi comedy film.

Former member Terry Jones has written a script which involves a hapless teacher suddenly given God-like powers by a council of odd aliens – and he is lined up to direct it.

But although John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam and Jones himself have all agreed to voice the aliens, their colleague Eric Idle has refused to sign up.

His stance is thought to have deterred investors in the film, titled Absolutely Anything – and could rob each of the other Pythons of a £3.5 million payday.

Producers, who include Jones’s son Bill, have raised only £10 million of the £30 million needed, and are said to be desperately keen to talk Idle round.

But it seems unlikely, after Idle wrote on Twitter: ‘These Python reunion rumours are just b******s. Some greedy b****** producer in Hollywood floating an idea.’

If the film gets off the ground, it would also star Robin Williams as the voice of a talking dog – while Star Trek heartthrob Benedict Cumberbatch and former Bond girl Gemma Arterton have reportedly been approached for leading roles.

New film: A 44-page document has been aimed at potential backers for the film

A 44-page document aimed at potential backers with at least £1 million to invest suggests that Idle could still be involved.

However, he has been steadfast so far – and explained on Twitter that he has not turned down a Python reunion but a film that just happens to have the involvement of his former colleagues.

He wrote: ‘I’m not “Not in a Python film”. I’m not in a Terry Jones film. If you can’t see the difference then you should probably lie down for a bit.’

In the pitch, Jones writes: ‘It’s a funny script so I guess the idea is to make it into a funny film. It has a laugh rate comparable to Monty Python And The Holy Grail or Life Of Brian so it is my sacred duty to make it funny on film!’

It would not be the first time Idle has shunned a reunion, as he was the only ex-Python not to contribute to last year’s film A Liar’s Autobiography, about Graham Chapman – their colleague who died in 1989.

However, he earns millions from the Python legacy as creator of the hit Spamalot musical.

Idle has joked in the past that there would be a reunion just as soon as Chapman ‘comes back from the dead’.

But he has tried to reunite the group before, mooting a sequel to Holy Grail in 1998 that Cleese rejected.

Instead he wrote Spamalot, which only caused more tensions in the group after he complained about the royalties he had to pay his former colleagues.

Cleese, who has made no secret of the fact he needs cash to fund a £20 million divorce, dubbed his fellow comic ‘Yoko Idle’ in reference to Yoko Ono’s reputation for breaking up The Beatles, when he tweeted: ‘I see Yoko Idle’s been moaning (again), about the royalties he had to pay the other Pythons for Spamalot. Apparently he paid me “millions”.’

Later, he added: ‘Actual rough figures last time we checked – Yoko Idle $13m, Michael Palin $1.1m, the others just under a million each .  .  .’
