A woman has sparked uproar on social media after enthusiastically bearing her K-cup breasts on Google Street View. 

Karen Davis from Port Pirie in South Australia was captured streaking by the Google camera cars for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view.

However the 38-year-old mother, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at 'flat-tittie chicks' claiming they are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. 

Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts 

In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street.

Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. 

Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold.  

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 

'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said.  

Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 

'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public.

Ms Davis had issues with her siz-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday 

'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.'

Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. 

'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 

'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. 

However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps.   

The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny 

'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. 

Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. 

She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online.   

'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said.

Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did.  

Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies 

'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. 

She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. 

Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them.  

Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 

'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. 

While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door 

She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia.  

'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. 

Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received.

'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 

'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.'

Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.
