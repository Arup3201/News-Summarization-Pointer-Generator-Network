Over the past four years David Bez has changed job, moved house, had a son, made over 1,000 salads - and had his first book published. He is the salad man, and he's determined to sex up its image.

'It upsets me that people overlook salads; they see them as an unsexy side dish when they can be a fantastic meal in their own right,' says David.

'Salads are amazing. They can be varied and creative. They can be light or heavy, hot or cold. It's a broad spectrum that I never get bored with.'

Salad love: David Bez is determined to get the nation hooked on green stuff again

David, 40, a graphic designer, has had no cookery training and had never even considered himself to be a foodie until he moved to London from his native Milan in Italy seven years ago. With a busy job as head of design at the Discovery Channel, he depended on takeaways and ready meals at his desk for his lunches.

But then he put on nearly 2st and began to feel tired and lethargic. Meanwhile, two close friends were diagnosed with cancer and David started to worry about his own health.

'I've never thought of myself as a foodie, I just knew I liked food like any Italian,' he says. 'In Italy people don't think about food and what is healthy because it's all there anyway,' he says.

'There aren't really any ready meals and most meals have fresh vegetables. But living in England helped me make the connection between food and health. My mother died of breast cancer a few years ago and when friends my age started to get really ill it made me think about the food I was eating.'

David says that salads add a plethora of exciting combination options

He began to make his own meals for work. 'Initially I didn't call them salads, I just wanted to eat healthily. But then I realised that's what they were.'

Then he started to take salad seriously, doing a big shop on a Monday and taking over the office fridge. In his drawer was a chopping board, knife, peeler and a variety of spices and seeds, while on the window near his desk he started to grow a selection of herbs. He also wanted to be creative; no boring salads for him.

'I knew a lot of people who ate the same salads all the time - I wanted to break away from that and create something colourful and incredible.'

Not surprisingly he started to get attention from his colleagues. 'People in the office would stop and watch what I was doing. They definitely thought I was a bit eccentric, but I think they admired the way I did it every day. Some would say, "What the hell is that?" and tell me to come down to the pub with them, but others would say, "That looks amazing!" I'm a keen photographer so I started taking pictures just before I ate the salad, and that's when I decided to set myself a challenge and do a blog.'

That was four years ago, and his challenge was '365 days of salads' in which he would make a salad every lunchtime in the office. His blog attracted attention from salad lovers, and though he finished the challenge - and lost that 2st - he still makes a salad every day.

'If it looks mouthwatering you've got them. Even if it is "only" a salad.'

The blog now has more than 40,000 daily viewers and has been turned into a book, Salad Love, which is being serialised in Weekend over the next three weeks. The book features his favourite 260 salads from the blog, and the photos are the ones he took shortly before he started munching away.

'My aim is to create the perfect salad. The Japanese believe it takes eight years to master something, so maybe I'll have to do this for another four years,' he laughs. He's had a few disasters.

'Once I mixed black beans and beetroot and it was dreadful,' he says. 'And I tried adding chocolate - I won't be doing that again.' But trial and error have helped him fine-tune what he likes in a salad; not too many ingredients so that you can taste each one, plus plenty of vegetables, one or two types of protein, herbs and a dressing.

His favourite in the book is a mixture of brown rice, black beans, tomato, avocado and chilli.

'It blew my mind in a way that I didn't expect,' he laughs. He tries to avoid buying veggies out of season, and compensates for the winter cold by adding hot couscous, rice or quinoa, and warming spices like ginger and chilli.

He lives in east London with his wife Vera and three-year-old son Nico, and recently left his job at Discovery to work as a freelance designer while hoping his book will open further doors.

'A lot of people ask me on my blog when I'm going to open a restaurant and that's something I'd think about,' he says. 'Everything that's happened is amazing - I don't know what the future holds but I want to continue developing my knowledge of food and writing about it.'

While he never had a mission in mind, he likes the idea of inspiring people to eat more healthily. 'I realised that if you want to appeal to everyone, then it should be through the beauty of it,' he says. 'If it looks mouthwatering you've got them. Even if it is "only" a salad.'
