Angela Merkel briefly ditched her day job  as she hopped on to a quad bike while visiting a German rescue centre.

The Chancellor was  getting up close and personal with mountain rescue vehicles as she visited the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance in Bonn, to learn about the work of the office and of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief.

Unfortunately she did not go so far as to drive the vehicle, but she did get stuck in in the kitchen, making soup with members of humanitarian aid organisation Malteser. 

While she was amid the action, David Cameron was beginning his second holiday of the year - in Polzeath, Cornwall. He has been criticised for taking more time off as Britain becomes increasingly involved in the ongoing crisis in Iraq.

Mrs Merkel took her annual holiday in April, heading to the same Italian island she has been going to for years - D'Ischia, near Naples, with her husband Jaochim Sauer.

It is perhaps unsurprising that she was careful in the seat of the quad bike - in January she fractured a bone in her pelvis while skiing in Switzerland.
