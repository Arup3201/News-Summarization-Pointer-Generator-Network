MPs are to receive taxpayer-funded iPads in an attempt to modernise Parliament.

Politicians will be able to put the tablet computers on expenses if they give up one of their old pieces of computer kit in return.

Around 350 MPs who sit in the House of Commons on select committees will be offered the devices without having to trade.

Buying an iPad for every single MP in the Commons could cost as much as £430,000 – not including monthly subscription charges to access the internet on the move.

But the House of Commons commission, led by Speaker John Bercow, insisted the move would cut costs and save paper.

The Commons authorities changed the rules
last year to allow MPs to use iPads and BlackBerrys in the Commons 
chamber so that they can surf the web and check emails during debates.

In October, David Heath, deputy leader of the Commons, became the first minister to use an iPad at the despatch box.

Freedom of Information requests have revealed that 70 MPs have already claimed on their expenses accounts for the devices, which sell for between £400 and £660.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is in charge of allowances, originally turned down the request, but backed down on appeal.

Early last year, some 16 MPs began a  trial to find out whether using iPads could improve Parliament’s way of working.

Last month, the Commons Administration Committee concluded that the devices would reduce paperwork and even end up saving the taxpayer money.

It recommended the ‘rapid roll-out of suitable mobile tablet hardware’ to all 650 MPs.

The House of Lords is also considering similar moves to give free iPads to its members. Ten peers have taken part in a similar trial, at a cost of more than £4,900.

The Commission insisted the scheme would save money while reducing ‘expenditure on paper and reprographics and improve environmental performance’.

The body also said the move to allow MPs to exchange their laptops for an iPad would save £50,000 on the cost of replacing laptops for other staff.

It added: ‘Further work would be 
undertaken to ascertain the level of additional savings which could be 
realised by wider use of iPads for MPs.

'These measures would be kept 
under review to assess the impact on parliamentary effectiveness and 
value for money.’

But Emma Boon, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘With the public finances in such a mess, the last thing taxpayers want is to fork out for a new toy for MPs.

'It might start with those on select committees but it’s bound to be rolled out across the Commons soon.

‘It’s a perfectly good intention to want to modernise Parliament, save paper and cut costs, but an iPad is a premium product, which means it comes with a premium price tag.

‘It’s good to see an initiative to get members to swap laptops for iPads, so taxpayers don’t pay for both, but there is no reason not to look at other, cheaper alternatives.’
