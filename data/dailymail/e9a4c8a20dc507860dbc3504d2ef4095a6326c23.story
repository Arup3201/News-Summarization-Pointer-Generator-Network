In a powerful, open-letter a soldier whose life was saved by a brave colleague during the Fort Hood shooting has described the desperate attempts of his fellow brothers-in-arms to resuscitate him after he had been fatally wounded.

In the letter posted to Facebook, First Lieutenant Patrick Cook hails the ultimate sacrifice of Sgt. First Class Daniel Ferguson as he barricaded closed a door that wouldn't lock - crucially keeping shooter Spc. Ivan Lopez outside.

In one horrific passage, Cook recalls how one week on he can still 'taste the blood' of Ferguson in his mouth only to then rage and demand the 'God-given-right' for soldiers to be armed on base to prevent another massacre happening again.

The gripping and tragic account of the 20 minute siege written by Cook, is one part tribute and one part judgement of gun-laws on military bases.

Cook describes how Ferguson, a 21-year Army veteran who had served in both Gulf Wars and Afghanistan rushed to the aid of his comrades as 34-year-old Lopez began to unleash his rampage on Fort Hood on Wednesday which left three dead and 16 injured.

The 39-year-old wedged himself up against an door that wouldn't lock as Lopez tried to enter - saving his colleagues and Cook.

Outlining how he found himself 'trapped in an enclosed room with fourteen of my fellow Soldiers, one of whom was barricading the door against a madman with a .45 pistol when he was fatally shot,' Cook reveals Ferguson to be a hero.

'Through what I can only describe as a miracle, he somehow found enough strength to continue pushing against that door until the shooter gave up and went elsewhere, at which time he collapsed,' Cook wrote.

'Nearly a week later, I can still taste his blood in my mouth from when I and my comrades breathed into his lungs for 20 long minutes while we waited for a response from the authorities.

'This Soldier’s name was Sergeant First Class Daniel Ferguson, and his sacrifice loaned me the rest of my life to tell this story.'

Using the last of his strength to prevent Lopez from entering the room, Ferguson's colleagues tried in vain to save him.

Response: Ivan Lopez, who was battling mental illness, shot dead three people and wounded 16 others with a recently purchased pistol before turning the gun on himself at Fort Hood on Wednesday

However, Cook uses his letter not to simply praise his fallen comrade but to call for the repeal of regulations that disarm military personnel on military bases.

'But I write to you today not to memorialize this brave Soldier, nor to tell a war story about how we made the best of a losing situation, but to express the part of that story that some in high positions of power clearly do not want told: I knew this was going to happen,' he wrote.

'I had been saying for five years that Fort Hood was a tinderbox of another massacre waiting to happen.

'It had to happen, because our betters failed to learn the obvious lesson of five years ago. Worse yet, I know it will happen again.

'More will die, more will be wounded, more families will be torn apart, needlessly. It happened again, and will happen again, because Fort Hood is a gun free zone.'

Cook described the 'utter helplessness' he felt that night when he reached for his belt 'for something that wasn’t there.'

'As the shooter kicked at the door, I remember telling myself, ‘oh well, this is it.’ It is beneath human dignity to experience the utter helplessness I felt that day. I cannot abide the thought that anyone should ever feel that again,' he said.

Cook also said that another massacre will happen if things are not addressed and do not change.

'It happened again, and will happen again, because Fort Hood is a gun free zone,' he said.

'To those of you who hold elected office, if you hear nothing else I have told you, hear this: you have the power to stop the next massacre from happening.

'You have an opportunity to restore the sacred Right to bear arms, which has been either stripped entirely or unjustly relegated to the poor substitute of a probationary, government-issued privilege. For God’s sake, do the right thing.'

The letter was read Monday at the Texas Senate committee on Constitutional Carry, Mr. Cook said on Facebook.
