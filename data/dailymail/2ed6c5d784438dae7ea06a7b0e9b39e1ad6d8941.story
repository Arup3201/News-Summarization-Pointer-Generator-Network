Talks: Before leaving Moscow for Beijing, Kofi Annan said that the main issue now is to start a dialogue

Kofi Annan, the United Nations and Arab League envoy to Syria, said today that there is not a deadline for ending the Syrian crisis, but it can't be allowed to drag on indefinitely.

Mr Annan told reporters before leaving Moscow for Beijing that the main issue now is to start a dialogue, adding that it would be up to the Syrians themselves to decide if President Bashar Assad should step down.

He has been in Moscow since Saturday for talks on Syria with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

'It may in the end come to that, but it's not up to me, it's up to the Syrians,' said Mr Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general.

'Our effort is to help the Syrians come to the table and find the way out of all of this.'

Mr Annan added that he had discussed a possible U.N. observer mission in Syria with Damascus.

'As part of the discussions we are having with the Syrian authorities, it's not excluded that a U.N. observer force may go in to ensure that the parties honor and respect the commitments that they are going to make,' Mr Annan said.

Mission: Mr Annan spoke after talks with Mr Medvedev, who promised Moscow's full support for his mission. Mr Medvedev said the mission 'may be the last chance for Syria to avoid a protracted bloody civil war'

Turkey, once one of Syria's closest allies, closed its embassy in Damascus today, citing deteriorating security conditions and putting pressure on the increasingly isolated government of President Bashar al-Assad.            

It made the announcement as leading Syrian dissidents gathered in Turkey in an attempt to bridge divisions within the opposition ahead of Sunday's meeting of foreign governments in Istanbul.  

A Turkish official said the embassy's closure in neighbouring Syria was a diplomatic message to Assad's government, which has so far ignored Ankara's appeals.   

Last year Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan urged Assad, his one-time ally, to step down in order to end more than a year of fighting between Assad forces and opponents of his rule.           

Turkey provides sanctuary to over 17,000 Syrians fleeing the violence, shelters soldiers from the rebel Free Syrian Army and allows the opposition to meet regularly in Istanbul.         

'We hope that they would agree to cessation of hostilities very shortly, and if that happens we will have to be on the ground to monitor and ensure that all sides are respecting the agreement.'

Mr Annan spoke after talks with Medvedev, who promised Moscow's full support for his mission. Medvedev said the mission 'may be the last chance for Syria to avoid a protracted bloody civil war.'

Russia - along with China - has twice shielded Assad from U.N. sanctions over his crackdown on a yearlong uprising, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed.

But Moscow has strongly backed Mr Annan's mission and has grown increasingly impatient with the Syrian ruler, with the Russian foreign minister pointedly criticizing Assad for being too slow with reforms.

Mr Annan said today that his message to the Syrian government was that they can't resist changes and that the bloodshed 'can't be allowed to drag on idefinitely.'

'I told the parties on the ground: they can't resist the transformational winds that are blowing,' he said.

'They have to accept that reforms have to come, change has to come, and that is the only way to deal with the situation.'

He added that it would be unrealistic to set any deadlines.

'It's not practical to put out timetables and timelines when you haven't got an agreement from the parties, and this is what we are working on as speedily as we can,' he said.
