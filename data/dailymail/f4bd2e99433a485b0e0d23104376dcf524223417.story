Adam Lallana has taken out a full-page ad in Southampton's Daily Echo to bid farewell to those at St Mary's after making his £23million move to Liverpool.

The 26-year-old was officially unveiled at Liverpool's Melwood training HQ on Tuesday and leaves the Saints after joining at the age of 12.

The ad, on page 75, read: '14 unforgettable years, the memories will last a lifetime. Thank you Saints fans for your endless support, a place in my heart forever.'

The attacking midfielder, set to wear No 20 at Liverpool, is sure to be missed at Southampton but realised a personal dream by joining Brendan Rodgers on Merseyside.

'I'm so excited for the next chapter of my career, coming to a special club like Liverpool,' Lallana told Liverpool's official website.

'I'm quite humbled and I just can't wait to get started. Hopefully I can settle in quickly, and I will give it my best throughout the whole time I'm here.

'I hope I can add something to the team and hopefully we can win trophies while I'm here, because that's why I'm here - for success.'

Lallana, whose ad in the Daily Echo seals his departure from a club he spent 14 years with, admitted the move intrigued 
him last year, as 
Liverpool came within touching distance of winning the Premier League title.

Lallana played for Bournemouth until the age of 12 and a sell-on clause was negotiated when he moved to Southampton's academy.

For that, the Cherries receive 25 per cent of Lallana's £23million fee, meaning the Championship side get £5.75m from the deal.

He said: 'Watching the run-in towards the end of last season was unbelievable, not just for myself but everyone involved in football.

'It got the hairs on the back of my neck standing up just watching them, and the style of football they were playing.

'Deep down, I was thinking to myself: hopefully one day I'll be able to play in that team.

'That dream has become a reality now, so I can't wait for that to get started.'

Lallana became Liverpool's second signing of the summer, after his Southampton team-mate Rickie Lambert joined for £4m.

Rodgers has also agreed a deal in principal for Bayer Leverkusen's Emre Can.
