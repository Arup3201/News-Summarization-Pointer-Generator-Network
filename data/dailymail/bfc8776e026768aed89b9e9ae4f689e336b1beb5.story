England put together their final preparations for the Six Nations opener against Wales in Thursday's Captain's Run at the Millennium Stadium.

The traditional light training session gives teams the chance to get a feel for the turf they will do battle on a day before the main event.

Skipper Chris Robshaw led out the 23-man matchday squad including the recalled duo of Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter.

England were trounced 30-3 the last time they visited Cardiff as their hopes of a Grand Slam were dashed in emphatic style.

The roof was closed that day but England have opted to keep it open this year in an attempt to dampen the raucous Welsh crowd.

Stuart Lancaster's side gathered for a huddle and ran through some passing moves as the England coach and his assistants watched on.

An eerie silence greeted England as they ran out on Thursday - but it will be an altogether different atmosphere when they collide with Wales inside the 74,500-seater stadium on Friday night.
