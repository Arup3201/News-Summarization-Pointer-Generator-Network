However, the weight proved too much, and the pair plunged from the block of flats, falling hand in hand on to the pavement below.

Fire brigade spokesman Jian Ku said: 'Firemen always watch each other's backs, they look after each other, this tragic death shows the strength of that bond between colleagues.

'Guarding one another in life, inseparable in death.'

The tragedy happened when emergency services were called to tackle a blaze on floor 13 of a residential block.

The fire had broken out in an apartment kitchen and had spread rapidly through the property, threatening to engulf the entire building.

According to officials, the apartment's owners had been using a large amount of electrical equipment, which may have started the fire.

Jian Ku added: 'Firefighters were engaged in rescue efforts at the scene that involved seeing if people were trapped inside and putting out the blaze when an explosion caused them to be thrown from the building.

'One managed to grab a handhold and grabbed his colleague, with the result they both plunged to their deaths.

'All their colleagues and friends are mourning for them and send condolences to their families.'

Qian and Liu had joined the city's fire service in December 2012. The tragic video of their deaths was taken by a passer by, Ken Lo, on his mobile phone.

He said: 'It looked like one fell first and the other reached over to grab him.

'The falling one managed to grasp the hand of his comrade but his weight was too great. His would-be rescuer was pulled over into the void. It was a terrible thing to witness.'

A police probe into the blaze is under way.
