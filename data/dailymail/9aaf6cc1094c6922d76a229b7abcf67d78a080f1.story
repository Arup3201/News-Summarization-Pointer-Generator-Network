The parents of the 12-year-old stabbed 19 times in a violent attack by two of her classmates after a sleepover last weekend, say their little girl is a 'fighter' and recovering in strides every day.

The unidentified middle-schooler was lured into the woods on Saturday by 'friends' Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, also 12, who planned to kill her in order to gain access to the world of the mythical 'Slender Man'.

However, the girl survived the brutal stabbing and was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911.

The parents of the 12-year-old victim of the 'Slender Man' stabbing said their daughter's condition is slowly improving. The girl is pictured being transported to the hospital after being stabbed 19 times by two classmates last month

On Wednesday, her condition improved from 'critical but stable' to 'fair', a spokesman at Waukesha Memorial Hospital confirmed.

Her parents updated friends, families and supporters on a fundraising page set up to help cover their medical bills.

In the message, they wrote that their daughter has been walking around the hospital with the help of her father and resting by watching TV in a wheelchair.

They say they've been 'overwhelmed with the amount of love and support' they've received, but ask everyone to respect their daughter's privacy by not naming her in social media posts or to the press.

'Our little girl is a fighter and is making strides of improvement each and every day. We appreciate your patience, love and support as we too are stunned and saddened by this tragedy,' they wrote.

As of Thursday afternoon, the fund had raised more than $14,000 of its $250,000 goal.

Geyser and Weier have since been charged as adults on counts of first-degree intentional homicide, and police say they had been plotting the crime for month.

to police that they stabbed the classmate in hopes of joining the cult of the 'Slender Man'

Both suspects told police they tried 
to kill their friend because of their obsession with Slender Man, a 
character they discovered on a website called Creepypasta Wiki, which is
 devoted to horror stories.

Geyser's obsession with the mythical 
man was something her parents seemed to be aware of as well, as her 
father proudly shared a crayon drawing his daughter drew of Slender Man 
while they were out to dinner on night.

But
 far from being alarmed by the disturbing sketch, Morgan's father Matt 
seemed to find it amusing and posted it on his social network account.

Beneath the picture he wrote: 'Only Mogo (Morgan) draws Slenderman in crayon on a napkin when we are out to dinner'.

The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth 
that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009.

In
 an official police report Weier said Slender Man is the ‘leader’ of 
Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty.

She
 explained Geyser told her they needed slaughter their friend in order to become ‘proxies’ of Slender 
Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest.

They 
planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion.

Geyser
 was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night. 

But
 they changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a 
bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew 
there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down.

When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband.

They planned to play 
hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of 
sight, in the trees.

All three girls were students at Horning Middle School. Above, Geyser poses outside the school sign in a picture posted to her father's Instagram account

It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed 19 times.

Weier said the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

But the fighter pushed on, and crawled out of the woods to safety where she waved down passing bicyclist Greg Steinberg.

On Wednesday, audio of Steinberg's 911 call was released, in which he can be heard comforting the 12-year-old victim while paramedics rushed to the scene.

Steinberg told the dispatcher that the girl had been stabbed, but was conscious.

'Yes, she's breathing,' he told the operator. 'She says she can take shallow breaths. She's alert.'

Suspects 
Geyser and Weier were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack.

If convicted as adults, the girls face up to 65 years in prison.

Geyser's family members broke into tears several times during her first court appearance on Monday.

‘The family is very horrified at what has happened,’ attorney Donna Kuchler said.

If
 moved into juvenile court and convicted, the girls could be held at 
most until they were 25 years old, Waukesha County District Attorney 
Brad Schimel told Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

‘It's a very shocking incident. There's no two ways about it,’ he added.
