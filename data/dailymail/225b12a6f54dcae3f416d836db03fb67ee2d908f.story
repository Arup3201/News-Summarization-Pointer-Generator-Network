Match of the Day pundits Danny Murphy and Martin Keown have been hit with tax bills of up to £2.5million after investing in a suspected tax avoidance scheme.

A string of celebrities and sports stars each paid a minimum £100,000 to invest in a movie venture that promised to combine box office hits with tempting tax breaks.

Former England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, 38, has been told to pay back £2.5million while ex-Arsenal centre back Martin Keown, 48, also faces a seven-figure  bill.

HMRC has told them the cash is due by the end of the month.

Mr Keown, who writes  for Sportsmail, said today: 'I can confirm I did invest in the film-finance scheme Ingenious, which has recently resulted in me receiving a retrospective tax bill.

'I have always paid my taxes and dealt with this new bill swiftly.'

Gary Lineker, Bob Geldof, Anne Robinson, David and Victoria Beckham, as well as Andrew Lloyd Webber are among around 1,000 household names believed to have put cash in to the same scheme.

But they are believed to face having to pay the taxman a total of £1billion after HMRC decided they avoided tax.

The Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP scheme had qualified for tax breaks under rules designed by the last Labour government to stimulate the British film industry.

Hit movies such as Life of Pi, Avatar and Girl With a Pearl Earring all benefited from their investment and tax relief. 

But HMRC now argues such schemes were not legitimate investment opportunities but a means of avoiding tax - and have asked the stars to repay them. 

MailOnline understands neither Mr Murphy or Mr Keown have  settled with HMRC yet but are likely to do a deal and pay back at least some of the money tax collectors have demanded. Both are currently unavailable for comment.

But source close to Danny Murphy told The Sun: 'He will be on six figures at the Beeb but paying off £2.5million would be a struggle for anyone. The megastars on big wages are able to pay but for others it is proving a huge struggle.'

Big names: Stars like Gary Lineker and Bob Geldof are also among the 1,000 household names affected

Ingenious used cash invested to help finance some Of Britain's most successful movies under rules devised by the last Labour Government. 

Murphy and Martin Keown are listed as directors between 2005 and 2011.

Other household names who invested in the firm's ventures include the singers Geri Halliwell and Annie Lennox, television presenters Ant and Dec and Davina McCall, and England football manager Roy Hodgson, along with football stars Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. 

Those who have spoken about their investment  believe they have done nothing wrong.

Last year Lord Lloyd-Webber said he was advised that he was being 'almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films', adding: 'At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.' 

Proud: Ingenious has said HMRC's demands were 'indiscriminate and unfair' and also said their financing of films like Avatar and Life of Pi created £1billion in taxable income for the UK Treasury

Ingenious has said HMRC's demands were 'indiscriminate and unfair'. 

A company spokesman said: 'The film partnerships run by Ingenious Media have already generated over £1bn in taxable income for the UK Treasury, with more to come over the lifetime of the films they funded. They helped to bring movies including Avatar, the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, the Girl with a Pearl Earring, Vera Drake, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Hotel Rwanda to the screen and are clearly run for profit.

'Accelerated payment notices are based on retroactive legislation and are inherently unjust. As regards the Tribunal, the hearing is ongoing and ‎Ingenious remains confident of the outcome'.

James Robinson, a spokesman for Ingenious Film Partners LLP, has said that a tax tribunal case against HMRC is  expected to finish in February.

A ruling on whether it counts as tax avoidance will follow later this year.

The Labour government encouraged the setting up of movie production companies as a way of promoting the British film industry.

These businesses helped pay for box office hits all over the world like Life of Pi, Avatar or Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

But it was also feared they were being exploited for tax avoidance purposes and HMRC has since pursued investors.

The terms of the arrangement allowed the investors - believed to have put in at least £100,000 each - to claim tax relief against virtually the total sum ploughed into the film by the partnership - not just the amount that they had personally put in.

The partnerships were normally arranged under a two-for-one basis, meaning that if a celebrity put in £100,000 it would be matched by £200,000 from a film's other backers - but the celebrity could claim tax relief on the full £300,000.

The rebate had to be paid back over 15 years, but by investing the cash wisely investors could beat the taxman. The films did not have to qualify as British.

Experts believe investors could make more money out of the delayed tax payment than they were eligible to pay.

But HMRC is now pursuing members and sent them accelerated payment notices - which were brought in last summer and allows the Treasury to claw back money quickly.

They believe the investors have gained an 'unfair tax advantage' and owe the treasury an amount 'relating to the tax advantage that the use of the avoidance scheme tries to achieve', HMRC says.

The guidance says 'If the person does not pay the full amount shown in the notice by the date specified we may charge you a penalty'. 

That is initially five per cent of the total balance and  could become at least 20 per cent on top of the bill within a year.

Many schemes like Ingenious Film Partners, who have been deemed by HMRC to be producing a tax advantage for members, have asked a court to overturn this decision.

But the Treasury reserves the right to hold on to any tax paid back even if they lost because they believe 'if we were successful with our appeal, you would not then pay the amount you owe'.
