Tony Bellew knows victory over Julio Cesar Dos Santos on Saturday will bring him closer to his ultimate dream – ending Nathan Cleverly’s career.

Bellew faces the big-hitting Brazilian in his second fight at cruiserweight, with bitter rival Cleverly clashing with Alejandro Valori on the same bill also in his second bout at 200lbs.

Should the two prevail, they are set for an explosive rematch later this year.

Stepping stone: Tony Bellew (R) wants to set up a rematch to retire Nathan Cleverly (L)

Bellew said: ‘It will happen and when it does happen I am going to retire him. Whether it be this year, next year or whenever, I will retire him.

‘I need to focus on Saturday’s fight and not give him a second thought. In the back of my mind the carrot is being dangled in front of me and when this fight is over he will be on my mind, but for now it is all about Dos Santos and getting the job done.

‘When his time comes he will understand and he will know what is coming.

‘When I get in the ring with him I am not losing two stone, I am not killing myself to do the weight, and he is going to know that.

‘It doesn’t need a World title. It is personal. The fight does absolutely nothing for my ranking because he is ranked below me. I will be fighting him purely for personal reasons, because I want to get rid of him. It is personal and that is the only reason I will fight him.

‘I am all about becoming world champion 
but I will be fighting him to purely please a personal satisfaction. I 
believe I won the first fight, but I didn’t officially get the decision.
 I am pretty confident I will get it next time – I won’t need decisions,
 referees or judges. I will just need a pair of gloves and him in a 
ring, and I will do the rest of the job.’

Boy from Brazil: Tony Bellew must first defeat Julio Cesar Dos Santos (L) in his second fight at cruiserweight

Dos Santos brings an ominous looking record of 23 KOs from 26 wins to Merseyside, and Bellew insists the carrot of a clash with Cleverly has not distracted him from a tough second task at a weight he is still settling in to.

‘I am going in with a top class cruiserweight in Dos Santos who gives out good tests,’ he added. ‘I expect an extremely durable fighter, somebody who is maybe a bit stronger physically than me, but I am pretty confident he will get a shock when I hit him for the first time.

‘Everyone goes the same way, they look at me across the ring and they think tall, skinny, he isn’t going to be able to punch much. I hit them for the first time and just look at their face when I nail them clean, they have been hit with something they haven’t been hit with before. It was the exact same with [Valery] Brudov. When I hit these guys, they think twice about coming in.

‘I have nothing but respect for Valori and I am sure he will go on to give people some tough tests but he came up against the new me – a huge-punching cruiserweight.

‘I didn’t have that kind of power at light heavyweight, and if I threw more than three or four power shots in a round at I would be tiring, so I had to limit myself to how many power shots I could throw and also to what I was taking back.

‘I couldn’t take many risks at because my durability just wasn’t there, I couldn’t sustain any punishment and I was feeling every single punch. At cruiserweight I am quite happy giving and receiving punches, so there won’t be any problems there – I don’t envisage myself being vulnerable at this weight.
