A giraffe helping itself from a plate balanced on a kitchen table and a shark swimming in the French Polynesia - these are among the extraordinary images released ahead of the National Geographic travel award.

Competition organisers, who asked entrants to submit both a picture and a caption describing the story around the image, have revealed some of the stunning pictures already submitted to the competition in the hope more people will be inspired and apply.

All entries must be made by the end of the month - with the eventual winner being awarded a trip to a remote part of south-eastern Alaska, US.

Keith Bellows, National Geographic Traveler magazine editor-in-chief and National Geographic Travel senior vice president said of the competition: 'The delight I get from our photo contest is seeing legions of so-called amateurs creating enduring images that continue to demonstrate the pictorial excellence that is the lifeblood of National Geographic.'
