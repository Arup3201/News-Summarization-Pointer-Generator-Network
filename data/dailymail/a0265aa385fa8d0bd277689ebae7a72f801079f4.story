Damaging winds, hailstones and severe thunderstorms were predicted to hit Sydney's far west as well as the Hunter, Illawarra and Central Tablelands regions on Thursday evening.

The Bureau of Meteorology said a severe storm swept through Springwood, Bilpin and the Yengo National Park in the Blue Mountains on Thursday evening before heading north. 

Photos on social media show large hailstones raining on residents in the Blue Mountains, described as 'sheets of ice' by local Shannon King on Twitter.

'I have some small dents in my car but animals (are) ok,' Ms King said.

Large hail was reported at Faulconbridge on the lower Blue Mountains at about 7pm.

Faulconbridge resident Andrew Ballard said on Twitter the hail was 'twice the size of golf balls,' reports ABC.   

The Bureau previously warned the hail, severe winds and heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding.

The storms come after wild weather lashed Sydney's west and south on Wednesday evening. 

More than 20,000 homes lost power when heavy rainfall, damaging winds and lightning rolled through after 7pm.

A Bringelly family was forced to leave their home when their roof collapsed, while another piece of roof blew onto train tracks at Mount Druitt.
