A family’s missing pet dog has been found 10 years after he disappeared - and in the nick of time, as he was a day from being put down.

The Staffordshire Bull terrier called Chance belonged to then 11-year-old schoolboy Sion Cox who was heartbroken when his pet vanished.

He and his mum Julie Coombes put posters on lamp posts hoping to find the loveable black and white terrier.

After disappearing for so long, Chance is now reunited with Sion and lives with him at his student flat in Cardiff

How Chance had spent the last 10 years since vanishing from Julie and Sion¿s garden in Barry, South Wales will always be a mystery

But as time passed they gave up hope of ever seeing three-year-old Chance again and bought another dog for Sion to play with.

But a decade later Chance was found weak and hungry in a city centre underpass and taken to a dog’s home.

Because of his age and his condition he was going to be put down, but luckily a vet scanned him for a microchip and Julie’s name and address came up.

Julie, 44, from Barry, South Wales, said: 'It was like something from a children’s Disney movie.

'I had a phone call to say my dog had been found - I thought they’d made a mistake because we have two dogs and they were both in the house.

'Then they said it was a black and white Staffordshire - my heart leapt, I knew it was Chance.

Julie said it was very emotional seeing him again after 10 years is certain he recognised his long-lost owners

'We went to the dog’s home and recognised Chance straight away.

'And as soon as we said his name his ears pricked up as if he’d never forgotten us.'

How Chance had spent the last 10 years since vanishing from Julie and Sion’s garden in Barry, South Wales, in May 2004 will always be a mystery.

Julie said: 'We bought him for Sion when Chance was seven weeks old. We had him neutered, microchipped, the full works.

'Three years later Sion when to school and I let him out in the garden, I went back out to let him in and he wasn’t there.

'We knocked on doors, looked everywhere and advertised it on the internet and in local papers.

'We did hundreds of leaflets and we never heard a thing.'

The dog was found 20 miles away from home

Chance was found in a shopping centre underpass 20 miles away in Newport and taken to the city’s Coronation Kennels.

Julie said: 'It was very emotional seeing him again after 10 years - but I am certain he recognised us.

'The dog’s home told us he was in a bit of a sorry state and to prepare for the worst.

'He was due to be put down so it was a case of: 'Quick! Get him out of there!'

'There was no way we could let that happen so we took him back to where he belongs.'

Sion, now a 21-year-old criminology student at the University of Glamorgan in Cardiff, said: 'It’s crazy - I never thought he would come back, at all.

'His back legs have gone, he’s got a few things wrong with him, he’s just been really neglected.

'But he’s eating well and he loves going out for a walk.'

Chance has now moved in with Sion at his student flat in Cardiff.

He said: 'Every time I leave he cries, I can’t leave him on his own. He’s more than happy here though, he’s pretty chilled out.

'I just want to keep him going as long as possible now. If that’s six months, ten months or two years I want to give him the best life possible.'

A spokeswoman for the Coronation Kennels in Newport said: 'It’s always nice to reunite a lost dog with its owner.

'Usually they’ve been apart for a few days or maybe a week or two - 10 years is incredible.'
