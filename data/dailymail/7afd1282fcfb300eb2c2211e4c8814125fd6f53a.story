Police last night launched a criminal investigation into  the manipulation of cancer waiting lists.

It is claimed staff at Colchester General Hospital fiddled figures on waiting times for treatments.

If criminal offences are uncovered, NHS staff could face jail.

Police have launched a criminal investigation into the alleged manipulation of cancer waiting lists at 
the Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust

An inspection by the Care Quality 
Commission found staff were bullied into changing data to hide delays in
life-saving diagnosis and treatment.

The
watchdog said 22 lives may have been put at risk. Some waited at least 
four months for drugs at the hospital, now in special measures.

Alleged victims include Mackenzie Cackett, four, who died after waiting months for a diagnosis.

The
CQC asked Essex Police to do an initial examination, and the force has 
now decided to hold a full inquiry into offences of misconduct in public
office. Yesterday NHS England also announced a review involving as many
as 25,000 cancer patients at the hospital in the past three years.

 - Monitor has ordered the trust to 'put right the patient quality, safety and governance concerns highlighted by the CQC'

- The regulator will appoint an Improvement Director to ensure the trust 'turns itself around'

-
The trust will be matched with a high-performing trust which can offer 
support and expertise 'in delivering improvement to the cancer pathway'

- The trust will be required to publish and regularly update an action plan that can be viewed by the public

-
The regulator has also imposed an additional licence condition to make 
sure the trust has the 'necessary capability in place to run the trust'.

The regulator said: 'If the leadership of the trust fails to act 
appropriately, this condition allows Monitor to take further action'

It
puts pressure on the hospital’s £165,000-a-year chief executive  Gordon
Coutts, who has refused to resign despite being accused of presiding 
over a culture obsessed with government targets.

His personal assistant Mandy Tapfield quit last month after 28 years at the hospital, claiming her ‘life was made hell’.

The 56-year-old claims she could not cope with Dr Coutts’s demands.

Her
husband Paul said she reported problems to watchdog Monitor, adding: 
‘That guy made my wife’s life hell. He degraded her.’ Hospital bosses 
are accused of repeatedly ignoring waiting time allegations.

At
least six employees contacted senior managers or board members about 
the practice from December 2011, but no action was taken.

Dr
Coutts, 52, was even contacted by a patient in March 2011 after a nurse
told him she had heard records were altered. He replied that he would 
only investigate if the patient had evidence of wrongdoing.

It
has also emerged Dr Coutts holds regular meetings with outgoing NHS 
boss Sir David Nicholson. He is on a board set up by Sir David to 
develop ‘outstanding leadership in health’.

Last
night a police spokesman said: ‘Following its initial review, Essex 
Police has decided it is necessary to begin a criminal investigation 
into the alleged manipulation of cancer waiting lists at Colchester 
Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust.’ 

A
hospital spokesman said: ‘The Trust remains focused and determined to 
get to the bottom of all of the concerns and issues raised in the Care 
Quality Commission report.’
