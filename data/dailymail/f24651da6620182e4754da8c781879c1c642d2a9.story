One of the UK’s most wanted men, who left a hand grenade outside the home of Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, was arrested in Amsterdam today, nine months after he broke free from a prison van. 

Kirk Bradley was wearing flip-flops, shorts and a T-shirt when officers raided his luxury apartment in the Bijlmer region of Amsterdam, the Serious Organised Crime Agency said today.

He is expected to face an extradition hearing in the Dutch capital later today, the agency said.

An international search had been going on for months since Bradley escaped the van with Anthony Downes while en route for trial.

Downes was also arrested in Holland and is fighting extradition proceedings after both were convicted in their absence earlier this year.

Both were found guilty of firearms offences after a series of shootings and leaving a hand grenade at the home of Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish.

Ian Milne, head of European operations for the Serious Organised Crime Agency, said the capture shows there is no such place as a safe haven, adding that Bradley was shocked as officers burst through his door as he had no idea the agency was on to him.

‘Joint working with Merseyside Police and the Amsterdam police has led to the capture of these two violent and dangerous individuals,’ Mr Milne added.

‘They are now back behind bars where they belong. This shows that criminals who flee to other countries are not beyond our reach.’

Last month, both Bradley and Downes, both 26, were sentenced to a minimum of 22 years after being convicted at Woolwich Crown Court.

Bradley was convicted in his absence.

Detective Superintendent Richie Davies, of Merseyside Police, hailed the ‘excellent arrest’.

He said: ‘The capture of Bradley, and Downes before him, underlines Merseyside Police’s commitment to work with other authorities to ensure that serious criminals have no place to hide.

‘The sentence handed down to Bradley highlights the real risk that he posed to the people of Merseyside and beyond. We will act on all information provided to take dangerous criminals from our streets, which we cannot do without the assistance of the community.’

Bradley and Downes, who described themselves as blood brothers, ran a criminal network between 2009 and 2010.

Three gang members who worked for them admitted possessing firearms and causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life and were jailed in March.

Gary Wilson, 27, of Promenade in Southport, was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years; Joseph Farrell, 23, of Brandearth Hey in Stockbridge Village, Knowsley, will serve a minimum of 12 years, and Craig Riley, 25, of Boode Croft, also in Stockbridge Village, will serve a minimum of 14 years.

The gang carried out shootings and grenade attacks and operated on behalf of others in the Liverpool underworld.

Bradley’s uncle Raymond, from Woolton, was arrested in central Amsterdam for possession of cocaine with intent to supply, the Merseyside force added.

A specialist arrest team from the Amsterdam police arrested Bradley on a British-issued European arrest warrant.

Arno Julsing, chief of detectives for the Amsterdam police, said: ‘What a successful arrest.

‘The collaboration with our British colleagues has so far been fantastic. Together we have managed to apprehend many dozens of dangerous criminals in the last couple of years.

‘Our approach works and we have found that the number of fugitives hiding in Amsterdam is decreasing.

'Our message "Amsterdam is not the place to be" has apparently been heard. Those who still don’t get it will be traced, arrested and handed over to the British authorities.’
