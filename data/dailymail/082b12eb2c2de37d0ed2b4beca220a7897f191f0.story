Ashley Judd is vowing to press charges against anyone who used vulgar and threatening language to harass her on Twitter last Sunday during the Southeastern Conference basketball championship.

The 46-year-old Insurgent actress and longtime University of Kentucky fan received violent threats on social media after she posted a tweet saying that she thought the University of Arkansas was 'playing dirty' while watching the team play her alma mater.

'I am pressing charges,' she told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday.

Taking a stand: Ashley Judd told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts that she plans on pressing charges against those who harassed her on Twitter during the Southeastern Conference basketball championship

Online trolls: Ashley explained that after she tweeted that she thought the University of Arkansas was 'playing dirty' during the game, she received hateful comments that were extremely explicit and offensive

Ashley explained that if she was in a 'more calm state of mind' she would have perhaps phrased her initial tweet about Arkansas differently but noted that people should not be aggressively harassing one another on social media

She responded to the graphic and hateful comments she received that day reposting them on Twitter.

'When I express a stout opinion during #MarchMadness I am called a w****, c***, threatened with sexual violence. Not okay,' she tweeted.

She added: 'I am sorry to retweet but this is a typical example. “@Leeroy_MAX: @AshleyJudd Go s*** on Cal's two inch d*** ye B**** w****.”' 

Shameful messages: Before the premiere of her new film Insurgent, the 46-year-old also sat down with NBC's Craig Melvin to discuss the amount of gender violence directed toward her on social media

'Everyone needs to take personal responsibility for what they write and not allowing this misinterpretation and shaming culture on social media to exist,' she said on MSNBC, before insisting that she was going to file legal complaints against every Twitter user who sent her violent or abusive messages.

Ashley also spoke to NBC national correspondent Craig Melvin before last night's premiere of her upcoming movie Insurgent.

'The amount of gender violence that I experience is absolutely extraordinary,' she said. 

'And a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that's directed at me in social media.'

Outrage: Ashley took to Twitter to speak out against the violent threats that she received during and after the game

Hitting back: The star wanted to highlight the sort of abuse that she received and shine a spotlight on those who think it is acceptable to use such violent language on Twitter

Super fan: Ashley can be seen cheering on the University of Kentucky during the SEC tournament final last Sunday

'That many people?' Craig asked her. 

'That many people. That explicit. That overt,' she replied. 

Since speaking out about the abuse, Ashley has received an outpouring of support from her fans on the social media site, many of whom have praised her for having the courage to pursue action against her abusers. 

'Great interview w/ Thomas Roberts. The "c" words I choose are caring and classy!! Oh and go cats!!' one person tweeted. 

Another another added: 'As [an] Arkansas Razorback fan, I am very sorry for the pain that any Hog fan might have caused you. Simply unacceptable!!!'

Big smooch: ESPN broadcaster Dick Vitale gave the University of Kentucky fan a kiss before the game started 

Shake it off: The next day, Ashley attended the New York City premiere of her upcoming movie Insurgent

Despite having to endure such a horrific spate of abuse at the hands of the Twitter trolls, the game wasn't all bad for Ashley, who was able to watch her team claim a 78-63 win over their opposition. 

The screen star also ended up on the receiving end of a very enthusiastic pre-game kiss from ESPN announcer Dick Vitale.

Shortly before the teams took to the court, Dick was pictured leaning in to kiss Ashley smack dab on the lips while she leaned away, her face in a tortured expression. 

She later took to Twitter to insist that the less-than-romantic smooch was actually her idea: 'Only surprise in my planting one on dear @DickieV is I've adored him for 10 years. At thrilling [University of Kentucky] games I've been known to kiss strangers!'
