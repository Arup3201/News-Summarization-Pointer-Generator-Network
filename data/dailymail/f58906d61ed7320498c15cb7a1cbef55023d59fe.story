Spain found their fizz again in a 5-1 win over Macedonia that will further fuel the debate over whether they are better off without Chelsea striker Diego Costa.

Costa’s hamstring injury meant Valencia’s young forward Paco Alcacer started his first game for La Roja and the 21-year-old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes.

Cesc Fabregas played in Juanfran and his cross was turned in by the new No 9.

Booked: Ristovski, Abdurahimi. 

Spain were already leading 1-0 after Sergio Ramos dinked in a Panenka-style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after David Silva had been brought down – the Real Madrid defender repeating the trick from Spain’s success in the last European Championship.

More impressive than the quickly established two-goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing. Without the reference point of Costa upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as Silva, Pedro and Fabregas buzzed around the new centre-forward, and full-backs Jordi Alba and Juanfran got forward to provide width.

Costa is yet to score for Spain in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth Brazil and played in Spain’s disastrous World Cup campaign.

The free-flowing forward football did not prevent Macedonia briefly getting back into the game when Agim Ibraimi scored from the spot after Juanfran had brought down Aleksandar Trajkovski.

Spain soon got their third when Alcacer turned provider this time for Sergi Busquets who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot.

The second half started with Iker Casillas justifying his selection ahead of Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, keeping out Franco de Jahovic with a fine save

 And it did not take long for Spain to make it four down at the other end when Alba got around the back of the visitors’ defence and pulled the ball back for Silva to score. It was his 21st goal for Spain – of non-strikers only fellow midfielder Fernando Hierro has scored more. 

Back in the game: Ibraimi's Macedonian team-mates congratulate him after he successfully converts the spot kick conceded by Juanfran

The bosses: Vicente del Bosque was back after offering his resignation after the World Cup and came up against Macedonia boss Boshko Gjurovski on the touchline

Combative: Ramos goes in hard for this header up against Macedonia's Stefan Ristovski during an aerial clash in the first half in Valencia

Dominant: Barcelona's Pedro takes the ball away from grounded Macedonian defender Ardijan Cuculi as Spain made their opponents work

Taking control: Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke, one of the newer members of Spain's starting line-up, brings the ball forward in the middle of the park

It should have been five on the hour when again Spain got down the Macedonia right with Silva pulling the ball back to Fabregas who smashed his shot against the bar. Fabregas was now sharing false-nine responsibilities with substitute Isco who had replaced goal hero Albacar – this really was the old Spain, playing without a recognised No 9.

Pedro was the next to find himself in centre-forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by Fabregas. He finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a Silva pass.

With 10 minutes left Spain had brought on Munir El Haddadi for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days. The Barcelona striker has a Spanish mother and Moroccan father and was playing in the level below Barça’s B-team last season.

His cameo and the performances of Alcacer show that Spain have plenty left in the locker as they look to defend their Euro crown. What remains to be seen is how Chelsea’s Costa fits into Del Bosque’s brave new world.

Making sure: Sergio Busquets accepts the congratulations of Fabregas after he made it 3-1 in the closing stages of the first half in Valencia
