Jonny Evans' wife, Helen, had to leap to the defence of the Manchester United defender in a rather awkward phone-in conversation with celebrity Arsenal fan Piers Morgan.

Mrs Evans, a presenter on the club's MUTV channel, dealt with the rather unwanted and uncomfortable call on Thursday night while sat alongside former Red Devils defender David May.

As she previewed United's FA Cup sixth-round tie at home to Arsenal, Morgan shifted the conversation on to her husband's 'spitgate' (a term used by Morgan) incident with Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse last week.

Tempers threatened to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gathered following the incident 

Arsenal (h) March 9, FA Cup*;

Tottenham (h) March 15 

Liverpool (a) March 22 

Aston Villa (h) April 4

Man City (h) April 12

Chelsea (a) April 18  (*Possible replay or FA Cup semi-final could mean he is available for the Chelsea game) 

A disciplinary panel ruled that Evans and Newcastle rival  Cisse had spat at each other in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor during the St James' Park clash.

Cisse was banned for seven games (he was given an extra match as it was a second suspension of the season) by the Football Association, while Evans was handed a six-match ban - despite fiercely denying the charge.

And the 27-year-old's wife reiterated his stance when Morgan quizzed her over his innocence.

'That's definitely the case [he had no idea about the spitting incident], he didn't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage,' she told Morgan.

'People can believe what they want but that's the truth. 

'Jonny spat on the floor and it was obviously near [Papiss] Cisse so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that Cisse saw it, but what can you do.'

Evans, nee McConnell, met the defender shortly after she landed her dream job for the club's official TV channel.

There is no right of appeal so Evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three-man panel

The couple started dating shortly after in 2011 and got married two years later at Clough Presbyterian Church in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Last year they became parents for the first time following the birth of baby Lottie in May.

Her husband's ban, which starts against the Gunners on Monday, could see him miss the FA Cup semi-final in April should United overcome their north London rivals.

However, Morgan feels Louis van Gaal's cup run will end at Old Trafford before boldly predicting a comfortable win for the visitors and more disciplinary problems for the Red Devils in a tongue-in-cheek comment.

'It's my usual confident prediction 5-0 Arsenal, [Olivier] Giroud hat-trick,' he added on MUTV.

'I'm also predicting at least three members of United's team to be sent off for spitting.'

As well as quizzing Mrs Evans, Morgan boldly predicted a 5-0 win for his beloved Arsenal on Monday night

Piers Morgan: 'Have you got any comments about spitgate?'

Helen Evans: 'Now I thought you might start with that one. No comments to make everything is in the statement Piers, I don't need to anything else.'

PM: 'I was just curious whether that Helen who knows Jonny [Evans], obviously better than the rest of us, that when he says he had absolutely no idea he had even be seen spitting whether she thought that was the case?

HE: 'That's definitely the case [he had no idea about the spitting incident], he didn't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage,' she told Morgan. People can believe what they want but that's the truth.'

PM: 'I certainly believe you but what I wonder, when you see the footage back, if you were [Papiss] Cisse and you watch that video back you could see why he felt that he been deliberately spat on, right?'

HE: 'Oh yeah. Jonny spat on the floor and it was obviously near  Cisse so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that Cisse saw it, but what can you do.'

HE: 'Thanks for talking to us tonight.'

PM: 'Well you haven't asked me for my prediction yet.'

HE: 'Yes go for it.'

PM: 'It's my usual confident prediction 5-0 Arsenal, [Olivier] Giroud hat-trick. Enjoy your evening.'

HE: 'Well we're predicting 8-2!'

PM: 'I'm also predicting at least three members of United's team to be sent off for spitting.'
