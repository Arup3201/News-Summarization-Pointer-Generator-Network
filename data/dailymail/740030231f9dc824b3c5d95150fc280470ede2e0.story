When Dawn Maw’s champion dog was stolen in front of her eyes she vowed to get her back no matter what the cost.

Eight weeks later Angel, a German short-haired pointer, is still missing but her devoted owner has been true to her word.

Not only has she remortgaged her home to put up a £10,000 reward for Angel’s safe return, but she has also put her life on hold, cancelling Christmas and taking unpaid leave from work.

Dawn Maw, 42, is offering a five figure sum to anyone with information that leads her to four-year-old dog Angel. Mrs Maw says her champion dog was taken from a car park near Barnsley, South Yorkshire

Angel was bought for £700 when she was a puppy and has appeared at Crufts

She estimates that her obsession with finding the animal has cost her £12,000.

Mrs Maw, who is married with one child
and two stepchildren, is an investigator for the Department for Work 
and Pensions, and hasn’t been to work since the dognapping on December 
6. She has used up her holiday time and is having to negotiate unpaid 
time off.

Christmas in her household was 
cancelled because ‘a member of the family was missing’ and instead she 
spent the festive season spreading the word on Angel far and wide. She 
spent £3,000 putting up 15,000 posters and distributing 35,000 business 
cards around her home town.

Another £500 has gone on hiring a pet detective agency and countless hours have been spent on the computer.

She said her credit cards are all 
‘maxed out’ and she has spent hundreds of pounds on petrol and phone 
bills, dealing with inquiries and investigating sightings all over the 
country.

The stress has meant Mrs Maw has lost two stone and she has been given sleeping tablets by her doctor.

Mrs Maw has created a Facebook page and is offering the £10,000 reward - believed to be one of the largest offered - for anyone with information to come forward

The 42-year-old set up a Facebook page to promote the search and hundreds of supporters donated £3,000 for a reward to find Angel, who has won five champion titles at dog shows nationwide. When that didn’t work she decided to raise an extra £7,000 herself.

Her electrician husband Dominic,  42, initially objected to remortgaging their home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, to put up a more impressive five- figure reward. He was persuaded to change his mind.

‘He wants an easy life and it’s the only way life is going to return to normal in our house,’ declared Mrs Maw.

She has spent £3,000 distributing 15,000 posters, and 35,000 business cards, in her home town

Commenting on the sacrifices she has made to find Angel, she said: ‘She is part of my family and belongs here in the house with me. I believe a dog is for life and not a throwaway item.’

Her other dogs are Lucy (English Pointer), Rattan (German short-haired pointer) and Mouse (Weimaraner). Angel was bought for £700 as a puppy and has competed at Crufts. Aged four, she was destined to compete in many more shows, as well as being a working gun dog, when she was snatched.

Mrs Maw was on her usual early morning routine walking the dogs. She was helping one of the others   back into her car when a white Transit van stopped and a gang threw Angel into the back and  sped off. She believes she had  been watched for a while before  the theft.

‘She can’t breed, so I expect someone knew she was a champion and decided to steal her,’ she said.

‘I feel my life has ended as I did everything with her. Out of all my dogs, she was the one I took to shows all the time.

‘We didn’t celebrate Christmas  at all and you wouldn’t have known what time of year it was in my house.’

Angel has been microchipped and there are blood samples from her relatives for DNA identification.  The reward for her is believed to be the highest offered for the return of a dog in Britain.

Mrs Maw said she received some phone calls as a result of the initial offer but nothing came of them.

‘I decided to increase the fee because I am desperate to get Angel back.

‘The reward will be for her safe return or for information that leads directly to her.

‘It will be paid in cash. I am simply determined to find her.’

The deal with their bank means the mortgage has been extended by five years to 20 years.

South Yorkshire Police confirmed details of the dog theft.
