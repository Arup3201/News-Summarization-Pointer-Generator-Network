The highest EU court has overturned a decision by member states to scrap pay rises for union officials because of the absence of 'exceptional economic circumstances'.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said in a non-binding legal opinion that it will increase EU workers' wages by 1.7 per cent, despite the ongoing financial crisis.

The document, which was published yesterday, suggests that the ECJ has sided with the European Commission in its decision to annul the Council of Ministers' rejection of the pay hike.

Opinions from the court's advocate general aren't binding for its judges - however, they often give an indication of the court's final decision.

The member states rejected a pay rise for EU officials in December 2011 based on a formula that uses the average of civil servants' purchasing power in a group of reference member states and an indexation for the cost of living in Brussels.

They declared that 'exceptional economic 
circumstances' justified changing the formula previously agreed with 
staff unions for calculating the workers' annual pay rises.

However, the opinion has agreed with the Commission that, although the EU's rules do allow for the suspension of the pay formula, such economic circumstances have not been met, according to EuropeanVoice.com.

Therefore, the Council is legally obliged to stick to the original formula and propose a pay rise.

Yves Bot, an advocate general of the court in Luxembourg, said the judges of the ECJ are expected to annul the Council of Ministers' decision.

His prediction is based on three cases that have been brought before the court concerning the formula for pay increase - however, the opinion is not binding on the judges.
