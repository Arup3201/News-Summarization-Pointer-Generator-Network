The BBC wasted almost £100 million on a failed IT project because senior executives ‘did not have sufficient grip’, an inquiry has found.

The Digital Media Initiative was riddled with confusion, delays and inadequate controls, a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) said yesterday.

And even though the scheme was axed last year, parts are still operational and costing licence fee payers £3 million a year, the public spending watchdog revealed.

Damning: The BBC was accused not having a grip on the huge project which ran into trouble, costing £98million

The
 findings are the latest blow to the BBC over DMI, which was launched in
 2008 in order to digitise the Corporation’s archives so that staff 
could easily share and download material remotely.

But it quickly ran into delays, eventually costing the licence fee payer £98.4 million when it was scrapped last May.

However,
 yesterday’s NAO report revealed that until last month DMI still cost 
£5.3 million a year to run because of costly software licences and 
maintenance contracts.

When
 the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was launched in 2008, it was hailed 
by BBC chiefs as 'the single most important initiative we are working 
on'.

But before a year had 
elapsed, it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as 'Don't 
Mention It.' The BBC originally appointed IT firm Siemens to implement 
the scheme. But it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered
 and took it back in house.

By then, £26million had already been wasted but it is understood the BBC later recouped the cost from Siemens.

In
 February 2011, the National Audit Office condemned the corporation over
 its handling of the DMI after it ran 21 months behind schedule.

The
 public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated 
and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated.

The Public Accounts Committee criticised the BBC for awarding the contract to Siemens without putting it out to open tender.

The
 project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and 
audio material - for example last year's Olympics coverage - on their 
computers.

As hundreds of 
staff moved to the corporation's new headquarters in Salford, this would
 prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from
 London, reducing production costs.

But the costs of the project continued to spiral to £98.4million until it was finally halted in May.

The
 BBC said it has now reduced the amount to £3 million, but admitted it 
has not yet switched off its old system, which costs an additional 
£780,000 a year to maintain.

Bosses were also criticised for failing to ensure ‘clear accountability’ for the project.

Instead, responsibility was shared between finance head Zarin Patel, 
chief operating officer Caroline Thomson and technology boss John 
Linwood, who was sacked over the debacle last year.

The
 report said Miss Patel – who was paid £337,000 a year – did not even 
attend some meetings and sent a member of her team instead.

Next
 week, the trio will be grilled over their roles by MPs on the public 
accounts committee, alongside members of the BBC Trust and former 
director-general Mark Thompson.

Labour
 MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, last night said she was 
shocked by the ‘astronomic losses’, adding: ‘This report reads like a 
catalogue of how not to run a major programme. These failures go right 
to the top.’

Yesterday’s
 report comes after  accountant PriceWaterhouseCoopers last month found 
DMI was ‘not fit for purpose’.

NAO chief Amyas Morse said: ‘The BBC 
executive did not have sufficient grip on its DMI programme.

Nor did it commission a thorough independent assessment of the whole system to see whether it was technically sound.’

Dominic
 Coles, the BBC’s director of operations, said: ‘As we have previously 
acknowledged, the BBC got this one wrong.

'We took swift action to 
overhaul how major projects are managed after we closed DMI last year.’
