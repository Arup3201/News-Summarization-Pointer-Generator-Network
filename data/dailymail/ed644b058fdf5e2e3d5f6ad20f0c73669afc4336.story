Internet giant Yahoo has revealed that the Government threatened to fine it $250,000 a day if it refused to hand over sensitive online information as part of a major expansion of US surveillance powers.

The company claimed that the new regulations are unconstitutional and attempted unsuccessfully to overturn the plan in court. Yahoo said the rules were contrary to their clients' fourth amendment rights concerning unreasonable searches and seizures.

Some information relating to the unsuccessful court challenge emerged after a federal judge ordered that some of the details of the case could be made public.

Yahoo said in a statement that it was challenging new rules introduced by President George W Bush's administration in 2007 that required online services such as search engines to supply the government user information.

Yahoo general counsel Ron Bell said: 'Our challenge, and a later appeal in the case, did not succeed. 

Mr Bell said the company tried to 'fight every step of the way to challenge the U.S. government's surveillance efforts'.

He added: 'At one point, the US government threatened the imposition of $250,000 in fines per day if we refused to comply.'

Yahoo's court challenge related to the controversial PRISM intelligence programme gave the government access to online communications. 

Details of the controversial PRISM programme were leaked last year by former National Surveillance Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. 

PRISM granted the NSA unprecedented access to electronic communications without the need of securing a warrant from the courts.

According to the Washington Post, after Yahoo's initial defeat in 2007 the company agreed to supply the required information to the NSA in order to avoid heavy fine while they continued with their appeal.

The US government claimed that the information the on foreign targets who were using American companies to communicate.

Yahoo tried to reassure its users that it does everything it can to protect user information. 

Mr Bell said: 'We consider this an important win for transparency, and hope that these records help promote informed discussion about the relationship between privacy, due process and intelligence gathering.'

The newly released documents show that the Bush administration was taking a hard line and was annoyed that Yahoo had even been allowed to get into court with its complaint.

Yahoo took their case to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 

The company said they will release 1,500 pages of documents relating to their unsuccessful court battle with the NSA.  

The-then US Attorney General Michael Mukasey said there were no constitutional implications relating to the new measures. 

According to recently released court documents, he said: 'The government has conducted warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance for decades, and such surveillance has been upheld under the Fourth Amendment by every appellate court to decide the question.

'The government's implementation of the Protect America Act is consistent with decades of past practice and adequately protects the privacy of U.S. persons.'

Yahoo countered that the government was overreaching its authority and was acting in an unlawful manner. 

The American Civil Liberties Union said the disclosure was a concern. 

Patrick Toomey of the ACLU said: 'The secrecy that surrounds these court proceedings prevents the public from understanding our surveillance laws.

'Today's release only underscores the need for basic structural reforms to bring transparency to the NSA's surveillance activities.'
