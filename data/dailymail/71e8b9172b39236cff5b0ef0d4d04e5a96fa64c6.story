Targeted: Detectives wanted to obtain information on who told Guardian reporters murdered Milly Dowler's phone was hacked

Scotland Yard made a humiliating climbdown last night over its controversial bid to force the Guardian newspaper to disclose confidential sources.

A potentially explosive hearing at the Old Bailey was abandoned after senior officers spent a day locked in meetings with legal advisers.

Anti-corruption detectives wanted to make the newspaper reveal how it obtained sensitive information behind its reports on the News of the World phone hacking scandal.

But after obtaining advice from prosecutors, police dropped their bid and a question mark remains over whether a fresh challenge will be made.

The abrupt U-turn came four days after the Met’s actions sparked widespread outrage and as chiefs endured a torrent of criticism.

Detectives wanted to obtain a court order demanding reporters hand over documents revealing who told them that murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone had been hacked.

They claimed the Official Secrets Act,
which has special powers usually aimed at espionage, may have been 
breached in July when the story was published.

But
politicians said the move was an ‘outrageous abuse’ while Guardian 
editor Alan Rusbridger labelled the bid ‘vindictive and 
disproportionate’.

Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme this morning, he said: 'I just hope that in our effort to clean up some of the worst practices we don't completely overreact and try and clamp down on perfectly normal and applaudable reporting.

'This was a regrettable incident, but let's hope it's over.'

The attempt to obtain a court production order later this week was abandoned after police consulted experts at the Crown Prosecution Service.

They asked for more information about the investigation and extra time to consider material already gathered.

The development is particularly embarrassing for police as it appears to indicate they failed to consult prosecutors properly in the first place.

The revelations that Milly had been targeted by phone hackers provoked widespread anger and rekindled the scandal.

In
the aftermath, Met chief Sir Paul Stephenson and Assistant Commissioner
John Yates quit, the News of the World closed and a judicial inquiry 
into the scandal was opened.

A detective on the phone hacking 
investigation, codenamed Operation Weeting, is being investigated for 
breaching the Official Secrets Act and misconduct in public office.

He remains on bail and has been suspended from duty.

Guardian
reporter Amelia Hill, who wrote several articles on the scandal, has 
been interviewed under caution as part of the leak inquiry.

A Met spokesman said the force has decided not to pursue ‘at this time’ the application for a production order.

He said: ‘There was no intention to target journalists or disregard journalists’ obligations to protect their sources.

‘It is not acceptable for police officers to leak information about any investigation, let alone one as sensitive and high profile as Operation Weeting.’

The spokesman added that the inquiry into whether a police officer leaked information from the phone hacking investigation will continue.

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: ‘The CPS has asked that more information be provided to its lawyers and has said that more time will be needed fully to consider the matter.

‘As a result the scheduled court hearing will not go ahead on Friday.

‘The Met will consider what application, if any, it will make in due course, once it has received advice from the CPS.’
