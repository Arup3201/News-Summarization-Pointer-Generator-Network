A frantic husband called police after his diabetic wife phoned him from hospital because she desperately needed a sugary drink.

Bridget Callan, 62, had repeatedly pressed her emergency button in the early hours to summon a nurse.

She was concerned that her blood sugar levels were falling dangerously low and feared she would lose consciousness.

Bridget Callan (pictured here on holiday in 1990) had been admitted to Tameside hospital with a chest infection. Her husband Paul was forced to call the police because nurses repeatedly ignored her calls for help when she feared she was having a 'diabetic hypo'

When no nurse arrived she called her 
husband, Paul, at home. He immediately telephoned the ward at Tameside 
Hospital in Greater Manchester and spoke to a nurse.

But after a further 20 minutes a distraught Mrs Callan phoned him back and said a nurse still had not come to offer her a drink.

In desperation Mr Callan telephoned 
the police to ask for their help but the switchboard operator directed 
him back to the hospital.

Eventually Mrs Callan was given a 
sugary drink which was necessary to prevent her becoming hypoglycaemic, a
 diabetic condition caused by low blood sugars that can induce a coma 
and even cause death.

Paul Callan said said he was left with no choice but to dial 999 because he was worried his wife would go into a coma or die. Mrs Callan was eventually given the attention she needed but died four days later after contracting the superbug C-difficile

Tragically, the great-grandmother died
 four days later in August last year from chronic heart failure and lung
 disease, as well as contracting the superbug C.difficile in the 
hospital.

Last night her husband condemned 
Tameside Hospital for failing to provide basic life-sustaining drinks 
for a seriously ill patient.

Mr Callan, 54, said: ‘What happened  
to Bridget in Tameside was terrifying. She rang me around 4am and said 
she had low blood sugar. She needed Lucozade.

‘She said she had been pressing the buzzer for more than 20 minutes, but no one was coming.

‘She asked me to ring the landline so I called the ward and spoke to a nurse who said, “Leave it with me”.

Since the death of his wife, Paul (pictured here on her wedding day in 1986) said he has been waiting for answers

‘But 20 minutes later my wife rang 
back saying still no one had seen her. I tried to call the ward back but
 the landline was engaged and I couldn’t get hold of anyone.

‘I didn’t know what to do. I was so worried I rang the police.

‘Eventually, my wife rang back and 
said someone had been to give her a drink. The next day the matron on 
the ward said I shouldn’t have rung the police – but  what would have 
happened if Bridget hadn’t been able to call me for help? She would have
 been  in a coma.’

Tameside Hospital has been at the 
centre of dozens of complaints over standards and is one 14 hospitals 
identified as needing an in-depth inspection because of its higher than 
average death rates.

Mr Callan is one of more than 100 relatives and former patients who recently met inspectors.

He has made an official complaint to the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) about his  wife’s treatment.

He said: ‘I think the hospital management need a kick up the backside. I can’t forget how Bridget  was treated.’

Last night a spokesman for Tameside 
Hospital said: ‘We are sorry that Mr Callan was not reassured following 
conversations with the PALS team and the consultant overseeing his late 
wife’s care.

‘We are happy to look into his continuing concerns and would urge him to contact us via the complaints co-ordinator.’

The case echoes that of diabetic Kane 
Gorny who died of dehydration at a London teaching hospital after he 
phoned police from his bed because he was so thirsty.

An inquest heard police arrived at his bedside only to be sent away by nurses who said he was confused.

Mr Gorny, who had previously had a 
brain tumour, was in a side room in St George’s Hospital, Tooting, after
 lashing out at nurses when they would not give him more water.

A Westminster inquest heard he called his mother, Rita Cronin, who said: ‘He sounded really, really distressed.

‘He said, “They won’t give me anything
 to drink”. He also said, “I’ve called the police. You better get here 
quickly, they’re all standing around the bed getting their stories 
straight”.’

His mother immediately went to the hospital where she found him delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue.

She told the inquest that staff tutted
 at her and refused to listen to her concerns that her son had not been 
given vital medication.

Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner
 Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: ‘Kane Gorny died as a result of dehydration 
contributed to  by neglect.’
