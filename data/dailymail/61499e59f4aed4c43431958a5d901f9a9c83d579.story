 Motorists in Los Angeles were stunned after a Second World War-era bomber flew low over the highway as it approached Van Nuys airport in California.

The B-29 Superfortress is the same type of aircraft which bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force Japan into surrendering, 

The aircraft, which was built in 1945, did not take part in the war, and despite the B-29 seeing service in Korea, the aircraft, dubbed Fifi, was not involved in that conflict either.

Extremely low and incredibly close: The aircraft was rescued in 1971 by a group of enthusiasts who returned it to flying condition

The B-29 was the bomber which delivered the first atomic bombs to HIroshima and Nakasaki and remained in service until September 1960

The historic aircraft was discovered in 1971 and underwent a full restoration, returning it to a flying condition. 

The aircraft flew into Los Angeles as part of a publicity tour where fans have the ability to gent onboard the historic aircraft and even buy tickets for a short spin. 

 A seat in the cockpit costs $1,045 while guests pay $575 for a seat further back in the aircraft. The bombadier's seat in the nose of the aircraft is the most expensive at $1,595. 

The aircraft is owned by the Commemorative Air Force after their members found it at the US Navy's proving ground in Chine Lake, California. The plan was being used as a target for naval gunnery. 

Amazingly it was not destroyed . 

For more than 30 years the aircraft was powered by its original engines, but they required replacing in 2006. The owners commissioned a specialist company to supply and fit some custom built engines allowing the aircraft to remain in the air. 

Boeing began developing the B-29 in 1939 as a long-range heavy bomber with four engines. 

The B-29 was the first bomber to have a pressurised cabin and it was also equipped with remote control guns

The aircraft was revolutionary as it was pressurised, meaning the crew did not have to use oxygen masks while on a mission. It was also the heaviest production aircraft at the time. 

According to Boeing, the aircraft also had remote control guns. 

Most of the B-29 fleet was involved in the war against Japan, with 1,000 bomber raids targeting Tokyo. However, the Enola Gay delivered the first atomic bomb to Hiroshima, while the Bockscar bombed Nagasaki three days later. 

After the Japanese surrender, the B-29 saw service in Korea and was used for anti-submarine patrols, weather reconnaissance and rescue duty.

It was eventually retired in 1960. 

Meanwhile, the Imperial War Museum in Duxford has built a scale model of the B-29 as part of its American Air Museum. The model was constructed by local schoolchildren.
