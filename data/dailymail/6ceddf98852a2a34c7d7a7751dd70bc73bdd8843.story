Newsflash: striker scores goal and celebrates wildly. Par for the course usually, but when Saido Berahino is concerned it warrants observation.

Seven days after he failed to raise a smile despite four goals against Gateshead in the FA Cup, Berahino struck again, a winner against Hull, and exhibited the emotion that shows this game is more than just a job. 

Arms wide, he waved enthusiastically and pointed to the stands where he later revealed his sister Mirielle was situated. ‘Let’s see if that celebration makes the headlines!’ he said. Well here you go, Saido.

Clearly irritated at the reaction his ‘professional’ response to scoring four provoked, Berahino clarified his view. ‘I’m almost a target out there, everyone is trying to bring a bad name to me,’ he said. ‘It is not in the rules that you’ve got to celebrate. 

Loads of players don’t. But I’m always the one getting blamed and picked out. I just smile and keep my mouth shut.

‘I don’t understand why certain things are written about me. To all my fans out there, I’m just trying to enjoy my football, make everyone happy and maybe one day achieve my dreams.’

Tony Pulis has won six of his last nine league games as a manager.

There are the underlying issues though, which his last comment hints at. Berahino wants to play Champions League football; a realistic aim for a striker with 14 goals this season.

But no bids have come in yet — Liverpool are said to be monitoring the situation, while Tottenham have distanced themselves — and talks initially intended to improve a £12,000-a-week contract are on hold.

Berahino is due to appear before Runcorn Magistrates’ Court on January 19 on a drink-drive charge, the day of West Brom’s game at Everton.

Berahino last week had a meeting with new head coach Tony Pulis, who wants to keep him but is minded to accept offers in excess of £20million. ‘It went well,’ Berahino said. ‘Obviously there are always rumours but all I can control is what I do on the field.’

‘I’m not going to say we are not going to sell him,’ said Pulis after his first league match in charge. ‘If a stupid offer comes in I’d look stupid if I said I’m not going to sell him. But if we get another striker in and keep him that will make my day.’

Leicester’s Jamie Vardy and Troy Deeney of Watford are on West Brom’s list of targets.

Brown Ideye, the £9m club-record signing from Dinamo Kiev, started against Hull but is woefully short of the required standard. He missed a glorious chance in the first half when slipped clear by Berahino, who drilled an indirect free-kick 12 minutes from time.
