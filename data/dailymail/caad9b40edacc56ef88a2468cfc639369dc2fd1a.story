Fresh storms due to sweep across the Northeast this week are set to smash Boston's all-time record for winter snowfall, which has already surpassed 100 inches.

Including a fresh fall Sunday night, the city has been buried by 103.9 inches of snow since the season began - and needs just 3.7 more to break the record of 107.6 inches, set in 1996.

And current forecasts indicate that the historic total will be surpassed, with as much as eight inches of snow due in Massachusetts thanks to snowfalls predicted for Tuesday and Wednesday night.

Buried again: Boston, pictured above last week, has been hit by 103.9 inches of snow this winter - and this week is set to break the all-time record

Higher! Heaps of snow in the city could be due to get even bigger thanks to new winter storms headed to the Northeast

As well as Massachusetts, this week could see snow across a huge chunk of the nation, thanks to two separate systems which are both due to strike the Northeastern corridor over the next few days, according to the Weather Channel.

One will see around three inches of snow hit almost every state along the northern border, from Idaho, across the Great Lakes into New England and Maine.

Another, less intense coating could cover an area stretching northeast from the Texas panhandle to Washington.

Around Massachusetts, snowfall of 3 to 6 inches was expected by early Monday across the area.

Snow is go: A huge chunk of the country is likely to see some snowfall before the week is out - with the Northeast once again at the center of the snowfall

Round one: The system, which the Weather Channel is calling Winter Storm Thor, will first see a band of snow hit the northernmost states

Round two: Wednesday will see a different band of snow stretching from southwest to northeast - bringing more snow to parts of the Northeast

In the south of the state, and over Rhode Island, the totals are more likely to be 4 to 8 inches in southeastern. Up to 6 inches of snow was anticipated in northern Massachusetts and New York state, and on Cape Cod.

Elsewhere, heavy snow was falling in the southern Rockies and Great Basin and heavy rain was soaking parts of the Southwest. A flood watch is in effect until 8pm Monday for east-central and south-central Arizona, including metropolitan Phoenix.

Snow fell from the Ohio Valley into the Northeast for much of Sunday and freezing rain hit the Mid-Atlantic.

All over: Monday is set to see scattered snow in northern areas, while the South heats up again

More snow: To the north of the country a band of snow can be seen. Boston is due snowfall Tuesday evening

And again: A mixture of snow and rain will fall in a band from the north-east to southwest through Wednesday

Record time? Snow could still be around Boston on Thursday, according to the above forecast

Clearing up: By Friday the outlook is clearer across the nations - though parts of the Northeast could still be shivering
