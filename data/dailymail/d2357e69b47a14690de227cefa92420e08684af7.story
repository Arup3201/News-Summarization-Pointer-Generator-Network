Police in Pasadena, California, are looking into claims that someone had hacked a high school teacher's email account and used it to send his nude photos to more than 200 people, including students.

The message with the word 'Enjoy' in the subject line was sent July 10 containing four shirtless photographs depicting science teacher Richard Rosa. In two of the images, the man's privates were visible as well.

Police investigating the incident do not believe that Rosa was the one who sent the email, which ended up in the electronic mailboxes of some of his colleagues, students and other Pasadena residents.

Inappropriate content: An email containing nude photos of Pasadena teacher Richard Rosa (pictured) has been sent from his presumably hacked account to some 200 people

Sick prank: Among the recipients of the email titled 'Enjoy' were high school students and Rosa's colleagues

Cleared: Police have determined that Rosa was not the one who sent the images, among them shots of his private parts

The X-rated email sent from Mr Rosa's Pasadena Unified School District account prompted School Superintendent Jon Gundry to issue a written apology to the recipients, the station KTLA reported.

‘If you received this email, I would like to apologize for any harm this email might have caused and want to assure you that we are working with the relevant authorities to investigate the matter,’ he wrote.

Educator: Rosa, a graduate of Michigan State University, has taught science at John Muir High School in Pasadena since 2007

Richard Rosa has not been reprimanded by the school district in the aftermath of the incident.

Still, John Muir student Devin Perry has preemptively launched a 'Save Mr Rosa' petition online, which so far has drawn 460 signatures. 

‘Mr. Rosa is one of the most professional teachers I know and I would hate for a great teacher to lose a job based on a mistake that may have been an accident,’ Perry wrote. ‘He's taught me so much and I don't want a teacher who has impacted lives to be turned down because of a mistake.’

School district spokesman Adam Wolfson told Los Angeles Times that Rosa is not facing termination.

According to his online biography, Richard Rose has been teaching science at John Muir High School since 2007.

He is the science department chair and lead teacher of the high school's Business and Entrepreneurship Academy.

Rosa graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Michigan State University and earned his Masters' degree in education from Cal Poly Pomona.

Pasadena Police Commander John Perez told Pasadena Star News last week that Mr Rosa is not a suspect.

So far, no one has been arrested in connection to the suspected hacking, but police say they have a few leads.

Under California state law enacted last year, it is illegal to disseminate sexually explicit images belonging to someone else.

If convicted, Richard Rosa's mystery hacker could face up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.
