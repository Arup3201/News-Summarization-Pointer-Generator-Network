Taking up tango classes is the perfect way to rid yourself of anxiety, stress or depression, a new study shows.

Just two weeks of lessons in the South American dance led to significant improvements in mood, researchers found.

In a study published in the journal Music and Medicine, academics in Australia have shown that dancing the tango has significant health benefits for people experiencing mood disorders.

The authors wrote: ‘Participants showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Satisfaction with life and self-efficacy were significantly increased.

‘At one-month follow-up, depression, anxiety, and stress levels remained reduced. A brief  programme of tango dance was shown to be an effective strategy in alleviating mood disorders.’

The team at the University of New England in New South Wales and Australian National University in Canberra recruited 41 people with complaints of stress, anxiety and depression.

The participants were aged from 18 to 73, mainly well-educated and 80 per cent were female.

Clinical assessments were made to classify their symptoms as extremely severe, severe, moderate, mild or normal.

Twenty participants then took eight tango sessions of 90 minutes each over a two-week period, while the 21 in the control group were put on a waiting list for classes.

The assessments were conducted again at the end of the two weeks.

Most tango participants showed clinically significant improvement in at least one area, whereas those on a waiting list were stable or became worse.

Dancers also reported less insomnia and better general life satisfaction.

One month later all 41 people were asked to complete the survey again and the results showed the tango’s benefits in reducing anxiety, stress and depression still remained.

The benefits for insomnia and general life satisfaction did not, however, suggest longer courses might be needed for sustained effects in these areas.

The authors said tango requires 'a strong connection' with a partner, synchronisation and improvisation.

They said study feedback 'indicated that this activity helped the participants to focus on the present moment and mentally switch off from their feelings of stress and distress'.

Another recent study, also by Australia’s University of New England and published in the British Journal of Visual Impairment, found that dancing the tango reduced depression, boosted self-esteem and improved balance in people with age-related macular degeneration.
