Police are hoping to identify a man who walked into an elevator and shot a victim before calmly walking off.

Terrifying footage has emerged of the hooded suspect strolling through the doors and pulling his gun out on the first floor of an apartment building in Brooklyn, New York.

He then fires at one of the three men inside, hitting him the side, just seconds after they had pushed the button to close the doors and go up.

Suspect: The hooded man is seen on CCTV walking into the elevator in the apartment building in Brooklyn, New York, on December 30

Terrifying: He then pulls the weapon out and aims it at one of the men standing inside 

The 25-year-old victim then keels over clutching his wound as the unidentified man walks away and the other two men turn away in shock.  

The injured man was taken to Kings County Hospital and is in a stable condition. He is expected to survive. 

The shooting took place at 8pm on December 30 at 940 Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.

The NYPD have released the video in a bid to catch the gunman. 

He was last seen wearing wearing dark jeans while his gray hoodie was tucked under a blue coat. 

Authorities have not revealed whether the men knew each other and what the motive was behind the attack. 

As of Thursday evening, no arrests had been made.  

Target: He then edges closer to the man in the green jacket and shoots him at point-blank range

Aftermath: As the victim keels over and clutches his injury, the suspect fleas the scene. The NYPD have released the footage in a bid to catch the gunman
