Anti-Semitism is still prevalent in Germany with some 19 million adults harbouring negative sentiments towards Jews, according to a new study

Anti-Semitism is still prevalent in Germany with some 19 million adults harbouring negative sentiments towards Jews, according to a new study.

The Anti-Defamation League's Global 100 Index found that 27 per cent of German adults answered 'probably' or 'definitely' true to six or more of 11 stereotypes about Jews in the survey.

The finding places Germany - which has an adult population of around 69 million - among the countries with the highest levels of anti-Semitism in western Europe.

Austria (28%), Spain (29%), France (37%) and Greece (69%) were higher.

Meanwhile, Sweden, with 4 per cent, had the least.

In the United States, 9 per cent of adults 
were found to harbour anti-Semitic views, while the figure for the UK was 8 per cent.

The highest level of anti-Semitism in the world was found in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza at 93 per cent.

The global average came in at 26 per cent, meaning some 1.1billion adults hold anti-Semitic views around the world.

The study, which the ADL called 'the broadest survey of anti-Jewish attitudes ever conducted', found the lowest level of anti-Semitism in Laos, with just 0.2 per cent of the adult population expressing such views.

'Our findings are sobering but sadly not surprising,' said ADL National Director Abraham Foxman.

'We can now identify hotspots, as well as countries and regions of the world where hatred of Jews is virtually non-existent.'

Foxman said findings about Greece had already led to an invitation from that country's prime minister to discuss possible remedies.

'Jews are more loyal to Israel than to this country/to the countries they live in,' was the most commonly accepted stereotype with 41 per cent of respondents surveyed across 101 countries and the West Bank and Gaza saying that it was at least 'probably true'.Â

The second most accepted stereotype, held by 35 per cent of respondents, was: 'Jews have too much power in the business world.'

The survey also found that only 54 per cent of those polled had heard about the Holocaust, a figure Foxman called 'disturbingly low'.

Holocaust awareness was highest in 
Western Europe where 94 per cent of respondents said they had heard 
about it and lowest in sub-Sarahan Africa with only 24 per cent.

According to the survey, 49 per cent of Muslims hold anti-Semitic views compared with 24 per cent of Christians.

But Jeffery Liszt, who oversaw the survey for Anzalone Liszt Grove Research, said that anti-Semitic views conformed more closely to region than religion with 75 per cent Muslims in the Middle East and North Africa holding anti-Semitic views while only 18 percent of Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa expressed similar sentiments.

The Middle East and North Africa region was found to be the most anti-Semitic and the Oceania region the least, followed by the Americas.

Anti-Semitic attitudes were relatively low in English speaking countries at 13 per cent compared with 30 per cent for Spanish-speaking countries, the report found.

The survey also found that among the 74 per cent of those surveyed who said that they had never met a Jewish person, 25 per cent nonetheless harbored anti-Semitic attitudes.

The survey interviewed 53,100 adults across 102 countries with funding from New York philanthropist Leonard Stern.

The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 0.97 percentage points for results across all nations surveyed and varies for results from individual nations.

The survey also found that only 54 per cent of those polled had heard about the Holocaust. Above, supporters of Karpaty Lviv hold a Nazi flag as they attend a soccer match against Dynamo Kiev in Kiev in 2007
