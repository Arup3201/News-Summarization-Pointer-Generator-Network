Her sister Kate may have had her fair share of Royal duties of late, but Pippa Middleton proves once again that she has her own busy social life.

She was spotted leaving Maggie's club on London's swanky Fulham Road in the early hours of Friday morning.

It was an impressive 1am when the social butterfly exited the bar and eatery, before she was seen drawing money from a nearby cash machine and then hailing a black taxi.

Stylish: Pippa Middleton was spotted out and about last night, leaving Maggie's restaurant on the Fulham Road at around 1am

Pippa, 30, wore a stylish white blouse CH Carolina Herrera top and trousers, shoes by 
Jaeger and her favourite Aspinal of London Marylebone Tech handbag.

She doesn't seem to have taken boyfriend Nico Jackson with her on her night out in Chelsea.

As the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sisterÂ walked into the taxi, she looked somewhat
stoney-faced, possibly feeling tired after a hectic week of bar and restaurant hopping?

Just yesterday she was spotted having lunch with male pal Jons Bartholdson.

She wore a colourful blue and lime skirt and top by Tabitha Webb, accessorised again with the Aspinal handbag.

1980's-themed club Maggie's has been a 
hit with celebrities ever since it opened in 2010. Inspired by - and 
named in honour of - Margaret Thatcher, the neon nightspot even has a 
bottle of champagne signed by the late ex-Prime Minister herself. And a letter of authenticity to prove it. It's run by was
 opened by Charles Gilkes, a friend of Pippa, and is frequented by not 
only the royal sibling herself, but Prince Harry and Made in Chelsea stars have all been spotted there, too. Cheers!

And on Tuesday, Pippa, 30, enjoyed a day in the London sunshine with a female friend.

The two 
sat outside whilst having lunch, with Pippa wearing a  flirty 
forties-inspired polka dot playsuit which featured black cap sleeves and lapel and waistline detailing.

 Pippa had recycled the the taupe outfit from the Whistles' AW 2010 collection, 
pairing it with a sensible pair of gold flat pumps and a matching tote.
