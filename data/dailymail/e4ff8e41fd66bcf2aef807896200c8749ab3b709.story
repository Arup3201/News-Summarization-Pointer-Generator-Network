This is the moment an attorney stopped police from arresting a disabled black man on suspicion of burgling a house almost a mile away.

Jody Westby came out of her house in Foxhall Crescent, Washington to see an officer preparing to search 64-year-old Dennis Stucky, a local handy man who told officers he was disabled.

Demanding to know why he was being detained, Mrs Westby was told police received reports of a burlgary and stopped him as a possible suspect.

'We have a burglar alarm,' one of the officers said. 'He's coming with bags.'

But after intense questioning, captured on video by her housekeeper, Mrs Wetsby discovered the burglary was in another neighborhood three-quarters of a mile away and there were no grounds for suspicion.

'I'm an attorney and this is wrong!' she said. 'Now please leave our neighborhood.'

The female officer attempting to arrest Mr Stucky insisted he was 'loud and boisterous' when she stopped him.

Fighter: Westby blasted the officers' conduct as they detained the man without a description

'That's because you're accusing him,' Mrs Westby retorted. 

Finally, after complaining to a passing officer about the incident, she secured his release.

'Come on Dennis, they said you can go,' she said as she helped him up.

She then turned to the police officer to say: 'I'm reporting this.

'Just because he's black doesn't mean he's here to rob a house.

'He works for us, he's been in this neighborhood for 30 years.'

It has since emerged that the owner of the 'burgled' house had accidentally keyed in the wrong number to his garage, setting off the alert.

The two officers, who were both black, did not have a description of a potential suspect when they went on patrol at 1pm on October 1.

Mrs Westby told the paper: 'It was very interesting, in the sense of getting a picture of how black cops treat black people, and how humiliating it was for him. 

'They were treating him just like a dog.'

Washington Police told the Washington Post they believed there to be 'no misconduct' and accused Mrs Westby of making 'assumptions of her own' by accusing the officers of racism.

Questions: She discovered he was being arrested on suspicion of robbing a house almost a mile away

Warning: She said she plans to report the case, accusing the cops of being racist for picking on Stuckey

No suspect: It emerged the officers did not have a description for a suspect of the alleged burglary

The incident will now be addressed at a committee on stop-searches in the city next week.

Some reports have noted that, while the attorney's bold actions should be lauded, the officers' reactions are revealing about class.

The Washington Post Blog by columnist Clinton Yates notes that Mrs Westby, a white, educated woman, receives 'an incredible amount of leeway and deference' from the officers.

'She’s pointing her fingers and gesturing toward the car window,' he noted. 'That's the type of behavior that coming from many other people would be considered dangerous, threatening or violent in some way.'

It turned out that the 'robbery' was simply a homeowner setting off his own alarm after entering the wrong garage key code
