A man saw his life flash before his eyes as a car veered towards him with an unconscious driver behind the wheel but somehow he amazingly survived and went surfing two days later. 

It almost wasn't a very Merry Christmas for Tim McKeague, 29, when just three days earlier a female driver passed out and struck him at an uncontrollable speed on West Coast Drive in Perth.

It's hard to believe from the shocking footage that Mr McKeague lived to tell the story - let alone walk away without any injuries from the frightening accident where the woman collected a total of three parked cars.

Even more miraculously - the unconscious woman and the little girl, who was in the backseat, also survived the crash without any injuries.

The car eventually comes to a standstill after smashing into a third parked car while Mr McKeague can be seen rolling around in pain on the side of the road

Mr McKeague said he could see the driver was unconscious as the car was veering towards him.

'I just let go and let my body relax and the car just went straight through me,' he told Channel Nine News.

Immediately after the crash, Mr McKeague couldn't move his right leg and paramedics thought it was broken.

'I started feeling more and more lucky as the minutes went past and as I got more feeling,' he said.

'It just kept getting more moveable and it was amazing - by the time I got to the hospital I was moving.'

Two days later, the keen and extremely lucky surfer was back out in the water doing what he loves. 

Mark Doyle, and his son Jake, were taking a leisurely coastal drive when the vehicle in front of them unexpectedly smashed into the parked cars along the beachfront which was captured on their Dash Cam on Monday. 

Mr McKeague, 29, could not believe that he survived as he watched the footage of the Dash Cam

First thought to have broken his right leg, Mr McKeague went surfing tow days later

More witnesses arrive and a woman walks around to check on the unconscious driver who also survived with no injuries along with the little girl in the backseat

Mark can be heard merrily whistling to a song by The Doors on the radio as they are driving along just seconds before the woman hit a parked vehicle, then struck the man who was standing by the next parked car before colliding with a third which forced her to come to a complete stop.

The injured man can be seen rolling around in pain while holding his leg on the side of the road as Jake and Mark run to his aid and several other witnesses rush over to the scene.

Mark posted the footage on Facebook on New Years Day with the comment : 'Ok people, new year, let's be careful out there. You never know who is on the roads.'

The alarming video has been seen by more than 275,000 people and shared almost 3,500 times.

Mark said in this post that the female driver told him that she had blacked out at the time.

Mark and Jake were praised for rushing to the aid of the man with some social media users describing them as heroes. 

'Thankfully it was only his leg and foot.. Well done you two for assisting... Just shows, you never know....' Karen Lawson posted.
