Panicking Tube workers fled in all directions to buy sugar so they could stop quick-drying cement setting after it was mistakenly poured into an underground station control room, it emerged today.

Contractors were seen pouring bag after bag into the sludge when vital signalling equipment was submerged in a 'f*** up of major proportions', staff have said.

Cement meant for new foundations of a £700million upgrade at Victoria had leaked into a control room, and a large amount of sugar, which is a 'cement destroyer', was needed to stop it becoming solid.

Hundreds of thousands of commuters were left stranded when Victoria Line services from Brixton to Warren Street were suspended yesterday afternoon, but after working through the night it opened again this morning.

Chaos: The Victoria Line was shut  after a signal control room was flooded with cement, so worker rushed to find sugar to stop it setting

Stranded: The leak onto signalling equipment  caused the Victoria Line to close at around 2pm between Warren Street and Brixton - it only reopened this morning

Error: The cement was meant for some foundations, but spread into a control room causing panic among staff

Aside from the obvious mistake, Transport for London was further criticised after they initially put the line closure down to flooding, but they said today there had been 'confusion' about what happened.

An insider said the catastrophe left workers knee-deep in concrete desperately trying to stop expensive signalling equipment being destroyed.

'The only word for it is a f*** up of major proportions. Everyone was f-ing and blinding when they realised what had happened,' an insider told the Evening Standard.

'It was knee-deep in the signal room swamping all the relay equipment and it’s going to be very, very expensive to repair because it was all brand new.'

Sugar is used by builders to keep cement liquid because it interferes with the binding process. Cement hardens when it hydrates, but sugar molecules delay the chemical reaction.

'When they realised what had happened they went out and bought bags of sugar and threw it on,' the same source said.

'TfL were telling people the reason for the closure was flooding, because technically it was. They just didn’t say it was flooded with concrete. They didn’t want people to know what a c***-up it was'.

Anger: Passengers were initially told the closure was due to 'flooding' at Victoria Station, but TFL said this was down to 'confusion'

When water is added to cement and mixed, it will set and harden.

To slow or stop the process sugar is widely used and is known as a 'cement destroyer'.

Small amounts of sugar - around 1 to 100 parts cement - will delay the onset of it becoming hard, but much larger proportions will stop the process completely.

But it must be done quickly, otherwise there will be no stopping the process.

The calamity on the Victoria Line left tens of thousand of rush hour commuters searching for an alternative way to get home last night, with police used to control crowds.

A spokesman for Transport for London said this morning the problem has been resolved and was now operating a good service.

Nigel Holness, London Underground's operations director, said contractors had been working on the new station in an area next to the Victoria line signal control room.

'These works involved the use of water and cement which leaked into the room, damaging equipment,' he said.

Pictures were posted on the UsVsth3m website showed a thick layer of cement in the affected room.

A spokesman for the RMT union said yesterday: 'We understand that a foot of concrete burst into the control room, having been poured into an escalator void.

'We await further information but what we do know is that LU technicians are on site now, working flat out to clear up the mess and get services back on line, proving once again that it's directly-employed public sector staff who are needed to deal with this kind of emergency, making a nonsense of Boris Johnson's Tube staff cuts plans.'
