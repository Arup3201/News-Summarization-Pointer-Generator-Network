Suspended: Jacquelyn Moore was suspended over the unannounced school shooting 'drill'

A middle school principal has been suspended terrifying students and staff by staging a shooter 'drill' that involved police officers entering classrooms with guns drawn.

Jacquelyn Moore, principal of Jewett Middle Academy Magnet in Winter Haven, Florida, was removed this week pending an internal investigation.

During last week's drill school officers went from classroom to classroom, with guns drawn, pretending to look for active shooters.

The station reported that the school resource officer involved in the drill was carrying a loaded Glock .45-caliber pistol, while a patrol officer was holding an AR-15 rifle, though it was not loaded, reports WTSP 10 News in Tampa Bay.

Some of the students panicked while others hid and ducked out of the way. 

'We actually thought that someone was going to come in there and kill us,' 7th-grader Lauren Marionneauxtold Fox 13.

School district Superintendent Kathryn Leroy said that she never ordered an 'active shooter drill be performed with students present and officers having weapons in their hands.' 

She publicly apologized and promised it would never happen again.  

From now on, any time there is a lockdown drill at school there will be an announcement, and parents will be notified, the school district said.

But Winter Haven Police Department's Interim Police Chief Charlie Bird told WTSP says the element of surprise is critical to making sure police and students, teachers and staff know how to react.

'The difference between a drill and an unannounced drill is that they thought this was real and people were in fear. However during this drill, an entire classroom was found to still be conducting teaching. There were students still wandering around not where they were supposed to be. 

Students still back at a desk playing video games.'

Jacqueline Vincent is a parent of a child at the school told WFLA: 'She is a really good principal I don't think she would do anything to jeopardize the children so I am not sure why they came to that decision.'
