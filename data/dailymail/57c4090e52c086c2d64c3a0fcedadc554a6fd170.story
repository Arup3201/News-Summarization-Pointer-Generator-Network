Just a few weeks ago, Kylie Minogue dismissed one of Madonna's costumes on her current MDNA World Tour with a 'no, no, no'.

So hopefully the comments won't come back to haunt the Australian as she joined a host of A-list stars at the front row at the Queen of Pop's London gig tonight.

Kylie, who was openly admitted to being a huge fan of the Material Girl, posed with designer Stella McCartney backstage ahead of the Hyde Park concert.

Threatening behaviour: Madonna performed with a model gun during the Hyde Park leg of her MDNA tour

Different looks: The mother-of-four changed outfits several times throughout the evening

The duo were just two of a group of stars, including Madonna's ex-husband Guy Ritichie, who watched the singer's first UK gig of her MDNA World Tour.

Also spotted in the 'golden circle' in front of the stage was George Michael, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and U2 rocker Adam Clayton.

The open-air concert was the latest date of Madonna's 87-date tour, which started in Israel in May.

What an opening: Madonna kicked off the show in her tight black outfit to her new track Gang Bang

Still got it: The singer showed no sign of her 53 years in the full-on routines

The 53-year-old singer repeated her controversial performances that had been seen in other countries, including her gun-toting fight with a male dancer to the song Gang Bang.

After arriving on stage later than scheduled, her concert wasn't affected by the rain half-way through.

She shouted to the crowd: 'OK everyone, let's say a prayer. Rain rain go away!'

Skin-tight: Madonna's super-tight outfit showed off her assets

Gruesome: Madonna performed against a backdrop of blood spatter

Keeping things sexy: Madonna wore a variety of raunchy outfits and even showed off her bottom in a thong

Other guests expected included Madonna's producer friend William Orbit, who tweeted earlier on Tuesday: 'Really looking forward to seeing Madonna in Hyde Park tonight!!! I'll be where the mixing desk is. (not doing any mixing!)... just is the ideal spot for sound and view. And I'll be signing along with everybody else! Let me know if you'll be there.'

Madonna's friend Ingrid Casares was also set to attend, tweeting: 'Madonna performing in Hyde park! Best place to watch on a beautiful London day.. #nothingbetter.'

Up close and personal: Fans who had paid enough got to stand in the Golden Circle and get close to their idol

Me and my man: The singer cosied up to a male backing dancer while wearing a black lace bra

Despite arriving late on stage, Madonna managed to end the show just two minutes before the 10:30pm curfew.

No doubt she didn't want a repeat of Saturday's gig at the same venue, when Sir Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen's performance was cut short after they broke the curfew.

Concert promoter John Probyn said ahead of the concert: 'It won't happen again. We've had lengthy conversations with Madonna's people. They contacted us. We've worked out with them what time she needs to go on stage to finish on time. That's all in hand.'

Sing to me: Madonna even wore a floor length gold sequin dress as she sang with a female backing singer

Drawing a crowd: Thousands of fans splashed out for the expensive tickets for the open-air gig

Well-prepared: Some Madonna fans were wearing wellies ahead of the soggy gig

Calling it a night: Jaime Winstone was seen carrying a Madonna T-shirt as she headed home following the concert
