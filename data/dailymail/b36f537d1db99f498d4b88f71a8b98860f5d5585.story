Steven Gerrard did what any of us would do after a dismal few months at work - by jetting off and taking in the sun and beach in Ibiza.

And it looks to be doing the trick, as the Liverpool and England midfielder posed for photographs and went for a dip with his model wife Alex.

England crashed out of the World Cup in dismal fashion, leading the 34-year-old to ponder whether to continue playing internationally or retire.

Gerrard will be 36 when the next major international tournament - Euro 2016 in France - takes place.

The midfielder, though, is mainly focusing on getting ready for the new season as Liverpool prepare for another Premier League title race after falling at the final hurdle last year.

Brendan Rodgers' men will travel to Danish side Brondby, tour the United States, and host Borussia Dortmund in a friendly at Anfield on August 10.

It will be a welcome change for captain Gerrard after the Three Lions gave a less-than-impressive account of themselves in Brazil.
