A Colorado father set off on a somber 15-hour journey this week to bring home the brutalized body of his three-year-old daughter who was beaten to death while left in the care of babysitters for weeks on end. 

Stephen Cross arrived at a funeral home in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday to claim the body of little Savannah resting in a small white marble casket.

Police say the toddler was savagely and repeatedly beaten by one of her caretakers, 27-year-old Ryan Reed, while his girlfriend, 28-year-old Allison clement, looked on and did nothing to stop the abuse.

Savannah Cross died last Tuesday after 
she was left to languish in the care of strangers after her mother, a 
stripper, had not picked her up from the in-house daycare in Phoenix, 
Arizona since Thanksgiving.

Cross, who last saw Savannah at Easter, told 12News in Arizona he had no idea his daughter might have been abused or that her mother was leaving her in the care of complete strangers for weeks at a time.

The former U.S. Marine, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and was living apart from the child for fear of hurting her, said that had he known about Savannah's treatment, he would have come for her.

Whenever he called to inquire after Savannah, Cross said her mother would reassure him that she was doing fine.

The girl's suspected killer, 27-year-old Reed, told
police he repeatedly hit, kicked and grabbed Savannah at his and 
Clement's day care center near Roeser Road and 48th Street while his 
girlfriend failed to report the abuse or seek medical aid, police spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump said.

Last Monday, Reed stomped on the 
child's stomach while she was on the ground and she curled up and spent 
the rest of the night in that position, the Arizona Republic reported.

Throughout
the night, Reed heard Savannah groaning but only called authorities at 
7am on Tuesday when he found her unresponsive, police said. She died on 
the way to hospital.

Crump added that Savannah's injuries were so severe that it will take further investigations to discover what killed her.

Investigators
found the girl was covered in bruises from head to toe and covering 
both sides of her body. They were at different stages of healing, 
suggesting long-term abuse, Maricopa County Superior Courts documents noted.

She had been in the care of Reed and 
Clement since July. Her 27-year-old mother, Ashley, returned 
sporadically to visit the child and pay the couple, Crump said.

The girl's grandmother, Cathy Cross,said: 'You don't drop your kids at daycare and never come back except 
to pay them. What is that, paid abandonment? What is that?'

Family friend Frank Warneka told ABC15 he lived with Savannah and Ashley until a month ago, but knew the 
woman often did not pay her childcare bill.

'They [Reed and Clements] sent a note home to Ashley saying she owned them $1,200,' he said.

'I called them and said Ashley 
doesn't live here anymore and that they should call CPS because it isn't
their responsibility to take care of Savannah.

'I think Ashley thought she loved Savannah, but I don't think she knows how to love anything.'

The
girl's father said that on Monday, he had arranged a private viewing for 
Savannah at Green Acres Mortuary and Cemetery to give her mother and 
other relatives from Arizona a chance to say their final farewells but no 
one came to the service.

Ashley has not been charged in 
Savannah's death but police are looking to interview her about her arrangement with the daycare service, which the mother found in 
Craigslist. .

On Tuesday, the heartbroken Stephen Cross embraced workers at the funeral home as they placed his daughter's small
marble casket in his car for the long, solemn ride home.

Once back in Colorado, Cross said Savannah will be laid to rest in a family plot overlooking a peaceful valley.   

‘Taking her home to be with family, I think, is going to be one of the happiest moments she’s had in a long time,’ he said.
