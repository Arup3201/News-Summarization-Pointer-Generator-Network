A never-seen-before archive of notes and letters by civil rights icon Martin Luther King including a page from his famous ‘I Have a Dream’ speech has come to light.

The unprecedented trove of documents dating back to the start of the American civil rights movement is being sold by Dr King's former secretary Maude Ballou.

The collection boasts handwritten notes from the 1959 speech Dr King gave at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Alabama announcing he was leaving to take up the equality fight in Atlanta.

Dr King was pastor at the church in the 1950s, during which time he led the Montgomery Bus Boycotts following the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to sit at the back of a bus.

Also for sale is a 1957 Alabama department of public safety list of people and churches most at risk of attack. Dr King tops the list, while Mrs Ballou is listed 21st.

Amazingly the papers were only discovered four years ago when they were stumbled upon at a college where Mrs Ballou's archivist husband Lenny once worked.

Among the boxed up documents was a typed final page of the seminal ‘I Have a Dream’ speech.

It was posted to Mrs Ballou, Dr King's secretary from 1955 to 1960, just weeks before he was assassinated on April 4, 1968, by sniper James Earl Ray in Memphis, Tennessee.

Last month thousands of people gathered by the Lincoln Memorial in Washington to mark the 50th anniversary of the landmark speech.

The collection is expected to fetch $130,000 (£80,000) when it goes under the hammer.

Sandra Palomino, director of historical manuscripts at Heritage Auctions, said: ‘This amazing archive was only discovered a few years ago filed away in boxes at a college in North Carolina.

‘Maude Ballou's husband Lenny was a meticulous archivist and kept a huge amount of correspondence that would otherwise have been thrown away.

‘It was incredible when the boxes were found.

‘Martin Luther King memorabilia comes to auction regularly but rarely is it as significant as this collection.

‘The items in this auction are poignant and touching, and reveal so much about the early days of the civil rights movement.

‘They come from a time where the movement was garnering worldwide support but still didn't have the backing of communities closer to home.

Rare opportunity: The items will go on sale at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on October 17

‘Almost 50 years after his death Martin Luther King's influence is still recognised and revered the world over.

‘I can't think of any better way to celebrate Dr King and the other civil rights activists than by putting these items out there for everyone to see and enjoy.

‘The estimate on the collection is very conservative but I trust the market to decide the price.

‘There has been tremendous interest in this collection and it could sell for many times its estimate.’

Howard Ballou, Mrs Ballou's son, said: ‘These are treasures from my mum's years at the beginning of the civil rights movement.

‘My mother has finally decided that she wants to share these items with the public.

‘It is time for them to be appreciated by others as much as we've appreciated them.’

The archive will be auctioned as individual lots at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on October 17.
