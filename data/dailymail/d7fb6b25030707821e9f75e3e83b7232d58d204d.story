Disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner is frontrunner in New York City's mayoral race

Anthony Weiner didn't stay up for very long.

The former U.S. Congressman who wants to be New York City's next mayor had a five percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal-NBC New York-Marist poll released Tuesday. But on Wednesday afternoon, a Quinnipiac University poll showed he was trailing  the openly gay City Council Speaker Christine Quinn by 2 points.

Quinn has the support of 19 per cent of registered Democrats in New York City, compared to 17 per cent for Weiner and 16 per cent for former City Comptroller William Thompson.

The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute is calling those results 'a three-way tie' since the poll's statistical margin of error is 3.4 percentage points.

Fully 28 percent of Democrats polled said they haven't yet made up their mind about whom they'll support in the September 10 primary contest.

If Weiner should emerge on top, it would cap an improbable political comeback from the depths of disgrace just a few years ago.

The then-newlywed congressman resigned in disgrace after confessing that he tweeted indecent photos of himself to women who were not his wife. That acknowledgement followed weeks of false denials prompted by a relentless campaign from the late conservative firebrand Andrew Breitbart.

Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a 
former U.S. State Department insider who was a close adviser to former 
Secretary Hillary Clinton.

His campaign has been based on the hope that New Yorkers will give him a second chance.

Although Weiner's numbers are soft, he 
would still claim Gracie Mansion if he were the Democratic nominee, the 
Quinnipiac poll shows.

As the Democrats' standard-bearer, Weiner would collect 36 per cent of the overall Election Day votes. Ray Kelley, who will run as an independent, would get 27 per cent for second place.

City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn is in the running for New York mayor.

On the same question, Quinn would still win, but with just one more percentage point than Weiner -- 37 per cent.

Weiner is also under water on New York Democrats' favorable-versus-unfavorable views of him.

He has a 37 per cent favorability rating among all New Yorkers, according to the new Quinnipiac poll, but 43 per cent of them find him unfavorable.

In March 2009, his favorable/unfavorable numbers were 31 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively.

Even among Democrats alone, fewer than half -- 44 per cent -- like Weiner. Christine Quinn's number on that score is 52 per cent.

The only subset of Democratic voters in which half have a favorable impression of the former congressman is African-Americans, 50 per cent of whom have positive things to say about him.

That could signal Weiner's campaign to spend more time and money in parts of the city where black turnout is high.

'Former Comptroller William Thompson’s spurt – no doubt spurred in part by his endorsement last week by the United Federation of Teachers – is the big news in this new poll,' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute

'The other news is Council Speaker Christine Quinn’s slide and that’s more puzzling. A few polls ago, she was edging close to the magic 40 percent.  Now she’s down with the guys.'

Carroll also noted that Weiner, whose online Twitter dalliances and serial fibbing made him the butt of jokes, 'does almost as well among women as Quinn.'
