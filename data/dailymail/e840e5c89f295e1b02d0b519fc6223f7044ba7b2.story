It regularly lures the biggest names in showbiz to pack their designer bags and take up residency for a good number of years.

So it's no wonder that Las Vegas is now home to some of America’s most fine dining restaurants, luxury hotels and entertainment shows that have kept divas like Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Elton John occupied when they're not on stage.

Britney, 32, currently the most well-known diva to be digging the desert – recently extended her residency for a further two years until 2016, performing her show Piece Of Me at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood, and is clearly loving life on the strip.

Born To Make You Happy! Britney Spears is currently the biggest showbiz star in Las Vegas, performing her hit show Piece Of Me at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood - which has now been extended to 2016 

One of Britney’s favourite places to eat – as well as the likes of Posh and Becks and One Direction – is Gordon Ramsay’s Steak restaurant at Paris Las Vegas, just a dice roll from Planet Hollywood, where Britney is currently residing.

Gordon's gaff has a superb atmosphere and a mouth-watering menu - including his pièce de résistance, the beef wellington - which is said to have been a favourite for both Britney and the One Direction boys (but perhaps not Posh). 

Meanwhile, staying at the Planet Hollywood hotel not only has the benefit of Britney on your doorstep, but also Gordon's other restaurant BurGR (breaking the mold of the traditional burger restaurant) and an atmosphere that immediately makes you feel famous. 

Where the stars stay: Britney is currently performing at Planet Hollywood, one of the most luxurious hotels situated on the Strip 

Even the standard rooms are 450 square ft, feature a king or queen bed and a 27" flat screen - while the 'PHabulous suites' go that bit extra with six plasma television screens, as well as stripper poles in the shower.

If you need a quick image makeover (as most celebrities do) or wardrobe change before going out, there's an on-site shopping mall - Miracle Mile Shops - with everything from designer to Urban Outfitters, Gap and H&M.

Seeing Britney's show is one of the safest bets you’ll make in Vegas for great entertainment. 

Tucking in! As well as Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, Britney recently treated her Vegas dancers to a slap-up meal at the Italian restaurant Buca di Beppo on the Strip 

Strip search: Planet Hollywood is certainly a go-to destination for many famous faces who vacation in Vegas 

Getting a piece of the action: Gordon celebrated the first year anniversary of his BurGR restaurant in Planet Hollywood last year 

What the show lacks in live singing, it makes up for in a huge stage production, all of her classic pop hits, and lively interaction with the audience (including dragging one lucky fan up on stage with her every night).

The other most notable hotels that are never short of famous faces include the Aria Resort & Casino, The MGM Grand, and The Cosmopolitan. 

When it comes to unwinding from all the entertainment (and getting over the hangovers) the Palms spa is the chosen destination for celebrities to relax. 

Former Vegas diva Celine Dion (who decided to postpone all of her shows at Caesars in July to focus her energy towards husband Rene Angelil) is said to have frequented the spa, as well as Hollywood superstar Demi Moore.

It also caters for men, too, with Ben Affleck and Ryan Seacrest also enjoying treatments at the facility, including the Gentleman's Facial.

Another celebrity hot spot for dining is STK (at The Cosmopolitan), where the signature steaks have kept the A-list satisfied, as well as the incredible cocktails and high-energy vibe. 

Most recently Hollywood actor Adam Sandler and his family paid a visit to the restaurant, and also rapper Nas and Orange Is The New Black star Taryn Manning.

Hustle and bustle: The Cosmopolitan (right) is favored by many celebrities passing through Las Vegas including Adam Sandler and Hayden Panettiere

Feeling like a million dollars: The Sterling Brunch at Ballys is known for its bottomless supply of Perrier-Jouët Champagne and unlimited servings of American Sturgeon Caviar

If you're in need of a healthier option after too much indulgence, one of the trendiest new restaurants on the strip is Yusho at Monte Carlo (where the excellent Blue Man Group is currently in residency).

Another must-eat is CRUSH at the MGM Grand, which is like stepping into a West Hollywood hotspot for the rich and famous.

The cosmopolitan-style plate menu and atmosphere immediately transports you away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, with its barrel-vault ceilings and private dining rooms.

Celebrity style: Many famous faces choose to stay in The Cosmopolitan in Vegas for their gorgeous boutique-style rooms 

Starry night: Hayden Panettiere is just one of the celebs that have partied at The Cosmopolitan (seen here at the Billboard Awards party at Marquee Nightclub last year)

If you're looking for one last hurrah before you leave, Bally's Sterling Brunch is certainly a way to go out in style.

Having been around for more than 30 years, the renowned Sterling Brunch has attracted just about every celebrity visitor, and was once favored by Frank Sinatra.

Thanks the bottomless Perrier-Jouët Champagne and unlimited supply American Sturgeon Caviar it is impossible not to feel like a million dollars (even if the trip has left you cleaned out).

But spending your time like a celebrity in Sin City doesn't have to cost you a fortune either, so long as you pace yourself throughout your stay and don't spend too much time gambling.

If you are travelling from Los Angeles (as many stars do) or somewhere nearby, a fun an affordable way to get there is travelling on Lux Bus America which has taken the likes of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills to the party destination.
