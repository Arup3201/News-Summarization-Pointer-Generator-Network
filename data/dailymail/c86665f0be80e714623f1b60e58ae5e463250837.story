Children as young as eight are among dozens of youngsters who have been arrested on suspicion of rape in the past five years - prompting fears that easy access to hard-corn porn is to blame.

Police in Greater Manchester have detained a total of 215 children aged 15 or younger on rape allegations since 2009, new figures reveal.

Most of those arrested were boys, apart from three girls under the age of 15 who were also arrested for rape-related crimes in the same period.

A leading children's charity has expressed horror at the findings, suggesting easy access to hard-core pornography and the rise of 'sexting' is now shaping children's views about sexual behaviour. 

Jon Brown, head of the sex abuse unit at NSPCC, said: ‘It's deeply concerning that such a lot of children are committing sexual offences, including serious assaults and rape.

‘For very young children, such as those of primary school age, we have to explore and understand the environment in which they are growing up in that has led to them behaving in this way.

‘It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they've seen.’

The figures from Greater Manchester Police (above) show that less than 20 per cent of those arrested were charged, while 10 children escaped with just a final warning - the equivalent of a caution when prosecution is not deemed to be in the public interest

Mr Brown said that increasing exposure to hard-core, degrading and often violent pornography could be 'warping' youngsters' ideas of what is acceptable behaviour.

‘It is also feeding into “sexting” where teenagers are creating and distributing their own videos and images that are illegal and have led to prison sentences,’ he said.

Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick said special procedures were in place to deal with young alleged offenders.

But he added that all reports of rape were taken seriously by officers regardless of the age of the suspect or offender.

He said: ‘Rape is a very serious offence and therefore we thoroughly investigate every report.

‘At the heart of all investigations is protecting the welfare of the victims.’
