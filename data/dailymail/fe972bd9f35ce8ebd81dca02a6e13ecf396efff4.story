Perched on top of a hill overlooking the dense woodland of the Pennsylvania Poconos, the abandoned Buck Hill Inn has an imposing presence. 

Left desolate after changing hands several times since its construction in 1901, the five-storey building serves as an obvious backdrop for all things sinister. 

The resort, formerly the respite of Quakers, made headlines earlier this year when searched by police in the hunt for alleged cop killer Eric Frein, a survivalist accused of the murder of one state trooper and the serious injuring of another.

For almost 50 days Frein evaded capture, somehow managing to keep off the radar of sniffer dogs and thermal lighting.

'Cop killer' Eric Frein is alleged to have ambushed a Blooming Grove barracks

Eric Frein went on the run after allegedly ambushing Alex Douglass and Cpl. Bryon Douglas in August. 

He is said to have killed Cpl. Douglas in a planned sniper attack at his barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania.  

The 31-year-old survivalist evaded police capture for almost 50 days by, it was reported, hiding in the dense woodland of the Poconos and Birchwood Resort in Tannersville.

He was arrested in an abandoned hangar in September, remarkably clean shaven after more than a month on the run from police, and charged with a string of offences including the murder of Cpl. Douglas. 

Suspicious cuts and bruises on his face were, it was claimed, the result of Pennsylvania police officers' struggle to capture him in the airport hangar where he was found.  

During the nation-wide hunt for Frein police faced harsh questioning on why the man, accused of the murder and attempted murder of two police officers, had not yet been arrested.

As speculation as to his whereabouts grew, details of Frein's life emerged, painting him as a 'self-taught survivalist' with a penchant for shooting.

In his adolescence he won prizes for rifling and later he worked for the Boy Scouts of America Minsi Trails Council.

On Halloween this year, following weeks of investigation, he was arrested by U.S. Marshalls.

Since then Frein has been imprisoned at Pike County Jail in Lords Valley, Pennsylvania, where he has received no visitors.

Prosecutors have revealed they will seek the death penalty when his case is heard. 

Yesterday Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf however imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in the state, describing it as 'error prone, expensive and anything but infallible.'

Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said he would continue to seek the penalty in Frein's case, responding to the governor's claims: 'This action will not deter my efforts, nor the efforts of prosecutors across this state, to bring accused killers to justice.' 

Previously prosecutors said the suspect, whose hobbies included dressing up as a Serbian soldier to take part in war reenactments, had a longstanding grudge against law enforcement. 

He did not have a specific target in mind when he opened fire on the barracks in August, it was claimed. 

As part of an extensive police search to find him, the inn was scoured. No trace of Frein was found - he was eventually discovered in an empty airport hangar. 

Now, a photographer reveals details of the abandoned resort, home to rusting bed frames, soiled mattresses and a litter-strewn swimming pool. 

'I've written a book about abandoned resorts on the Northeast Coast in the Borscht Belt. In that research I learned of another vacation region in the Northeast, the Poconos,' said Jonathan Haeber. 

'Both regions differ - the Borscht Belt catered to a largely Jewish clientele and the Poconos started as more of a Quaker destination. I was intrigued by the differences and similarities between these two cultural enclaves. 

'I was also interested in why both eventually became abandoned and deserted in favor of other vacation destinations.' 

'When it comes to abandoned buildings, what interests me is the cultural history, remnants of the past. Every building is like opening it's own time capsule. I'm formally trained as a historian, so I analyse a lot of the contents for their meaning. 

'As a photographer, my mandate is to document these structures before they disappear entirely.' 

Mr Haeber's visit to the inn took place years before it was considered in the hunt for Frein, though, he says, he would have been 'impressed' if the man had been able to successfully hide there. 

'I heard about the story on the news, and it was intriguing. If Eric Frein was able to hide away in the structure, I would have been impressed, because it is very closely watched and almost impossible to access without being apprehended by security.' 

Staircases left to rot lead to cracked flooring and shattered glass panes in the hotel's lobby, while weeds and plants have been left to grow through the disused swimming pool's surrounding area

Mr Haeber, a formally trained historian and photographer, said he was drawn to the property as it was like opening 'a time capsule'

Mr Haeber said he was drawn to the inn as, with most abandoned buildings, he feels bound to capture their existence before they are entirely destroyed by time 

One of the better kept rooms in the inn features dark, cherry wood panelling and a wide, gaping fireplace where guests would have been entertained

Reservation sheets and an old typewriter remain in the hotel's office. The inn changed hands a number of times in the 1950s but has been left desolate in recent years

A red chair lies tossed over in the middle of one of the largest corridors in the inn, where regal archways and wood panels suggest how the inn appeared at the height of its glamour

A collection of disused televisions possibly gathered from the inn's many guest bedrooms lie gathered in one of its lobbies 

Bizarre artwork is littered across the inn, with mismatching furnishings like blue and yellow curtains also seen in some areas 

A bed frame and broken mattress lie toppled against the wall while an old-fashioned telephone and lamp stand in the middle of one of the rooms. Right, colourful fabrics once possibly used for curtains are thrown in the middle of the floor

The inn in Pennsylvania was searched as part of an extensive hunt for the alleged cop killer. Frein is due to stand trial imminently
