A wealthy North Texas socialite has been sentenced to 14 years in federal prison after pleading guilty in a rare case of a woman being caught up in trading child pornography.

Prosecutors say 43-year-old Erika Susan Perdue was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty last year to one count of transporting and shipping child pornography.

She was given an eight-year term of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $5,000 in restitution to one of the victims identified as 'Vicky.'

Guilty as sin: Dallas housewife Erika Perdue, 43, was sentenced to 14 years after admitting to sharing and swapping child pornography for 13 years

Upon her release, Perdue will have to register as a sex offender.

During her sentencing Monday, a haggard-looking Perdue sobbed and told the presiding judge that she was 'very remorseful.'

'I lost two granddaughters to this,' she said in court, according to Dallas Morning News.

A search warrant was executed in April 2012 at her $1.4million home in the Dallas enclave of University Park. 

Prosecutors say Perdue, who is married to prominent intellectual property attorney Mark Perdue and has two grandchildren, admitted to trading child pornography and getting high on meth while her husband was at work.

Mrs Perdue was indicted in May 2012. She's been in custody since June of that year after violating conditions of her release.

Records show that the the woman, who was diagnosed with a bi-polar disorder after her arrest, was ejected from a treatment program for her 'threatening behavior.' 

Cache: Perdue had amassed so large a collection of graphic videos and photos depicting children she had trouble keeping track of them

Mrs Perdue is alleged to have amassed so large a collection of graphic videos and photos depicting children she had trouble keeping track of them.

The 43-year-old, who lived with her attorney husband in one of Dallas's most expensive areas, reportedly told police she traded in the illegal images every day.

Perdue was arrested in 2012 after unwittingly trading child porn with an undercover detective, the Dallas Morning News reported.

According to court documents, the housewife admitted to the FBI that she has been distributing child porn since 1999.

In April 2012, police officers armed with search warrants raided her $1.4million, 4,000-square-foot mansion and seized her computers, where they found a large cache of X-rated videos and still photos.

Agents said the images were extremely graphic and showed children — some of them toddlers — having intercourse with adults.

Police began their investigation in January 2012 after undercover officers made contact with Perdue on file-sharing sites.

The socialite used the name 'Classybitch' and unknowingly shared images with the undercover agents.

Perdue told investigators she was on the computer swapping and collecting child porn even on the day of the raid.

'She also confessed that she used file-sharing child pornography every day,' agents wrote in court documents.

victims are local. Her 2010 Chevrolet Camaro had vanity license plates 
that read 'MY SYN'.

The 
married socialite was released on bail in May 2012, but was rearrested 
the following month after violating her release condition. She has been 
behind bars ever since, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

By all accounts, Erika Perdue had a turbulent childhood and youth.

Raised
 in a humble Garland home, her parents split when she was 7 years old. 
While Miss Perdue was still in high school, she had her first child and 
got married at age 17.

Less than three years later, Perdue's husband filed for divorce.

Perdue's second marriage, which took place when she was 22, ended in a similar fashion after she was charged with a misdemeanor for making profanity-laced harassing phone calls to her sister-in-law.

In 2009, the twice-divorced mother took another walk down the aisle, this time with Dallas-area attorney Mark Perdue.

According to her mother, Mr Perdue has remained loyal to his disgraced wife throughout the ordeal and visits her regularly at the Mansfield Federal Detention Center.
