Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall has protested his innocence in the face of child abuse charges and condemned a police decision to arrest him at his home.

The former It’s A Knockout presenter, 82, also criticised ‘leaks to the media’ which he said gave a misleading impression about the case.

Hall was arrested at his £1.5million home in leafy Wilmslow, Cheshire in a dawn raid on Wednesday morning.

He was taken to a police station where he was questioned by detectives for several hours before being charged with three counts of indecent assault on girls aged between eight and 17 between 1974 and 1984.

The BBC Radio 5 Live football reporter spent the day behind closed doors at the home he shares with his wife, Hazel, 74.

But last night his solicitor, Louise Straw, said: ‘Stuart Hall is innocent of these charges. It is a matter of concern that in the week following the publication of the Leveson Report, there appears to have been systematic leaks to the media which have given a misleading impression of what this case is about.

‘Stuart Hall was not afforded the opportunity to attend voluntarily at the police station. In due course, the decision he should be arrested will be the subject of some scrutiny.

‘Stuart Hall is innocent. There will be a trial and his defence will then be in the public domain.’

Hall and his wife, who have two grown-up children, Daniel, 50, and Francesca, 52, are popular among the local community where they carry out a lot of charity work.

The charges are that between September and December 1974 he indecently assaulted a woman who was then aged 16 or 17.

The second charge alleges he indecently assaulted a girl aged eight or nine in 1983.

And finally he faces a charge of indecent assault on a girl aged 13 between July and September 1984.

Hall was bailed to appear before magistrates in Preston next month. Police stressed the case was not part of Operation Yewtree, the investigation into sexual offences allegedly committed by Jimmy Savile and others.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
