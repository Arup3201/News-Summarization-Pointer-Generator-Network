A rare burst of Southern California rain led to mudslides early Friday in the foothills near Los Angeles that had long suffered drought.

At least one home and a vehicle were damaged as muck flowed through Glendora, an  suburb located just south of the San Gabriel mountains following downpours.

Four feet of mud were seen behind one home with some soaking into the interior, Los Angeles County fire officials told KTLA.

'It’s against the back wall of the residence and it’s seeping into the house,' fire inspector Rick Flores said.

Part of the mud was taken out by crews using shovels and wheelbarrow ahead of heavy equipment being brought in. 

'We’re telling residents to do a self assessment of their home before they leave to work or school, make sure it’s safe to get out,' Flores added. 

The Glendora Fire Department cautioned drivers to be aware of any debris left in the roads by the storm in a press release. 

Mudslides were expected to come with heavy rain near the burn area of the Colby Fire, a wildfire that lit up the hills north of Glendora earlier this year, burning across nearly 2,000 acres of land.

The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Colby area early Thursday as the storm dumped hail and heavy rain in some areas.

Around a half an inch of rain fell near Glendora, though rainfall totals in other parts of the area were fairly low.

Snow hit Big Bear Lake, a small town up in the San Bernardino Mountains. California's historically harsh drought has brought water levels to dramatic lows.
