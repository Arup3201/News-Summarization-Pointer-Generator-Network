Horrific: Anthony Judge, 35, was jailed for life after admitting kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl in Huddersfield. She was praised for remaining calm throughout the ordeal and even asked Judge to use a condom

A 15-year-old rape victim has been praised by a judge after she tried to talk her drug-crazed attacker into using protection and remained calm throughout her ordeal.

Anthony Judge, 35, was jailed for life yesterday after he admitted kidnapping the schoolgirl at gunpoint as she walked to her friend's house for a sleepover in Huddersfield - before raping her twice in a motorway lay-by.

He must serve at least six years for the 'horrific offence' before being considered for parole.

Judge James Spencer QC described the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons,  as 'remarkable' and 'brilliant' for showing such bravery.

Judge had driven from his home in Manchester to Huddersfield on the evening of June 4 when he pounced on the young girl - putting a loaded gun to her temple and demanding she get into his car.

Prosecuting at Leeds Crown Court, Kitty Taylor said: 'She was in the middle of her exams at the time and was walking home to get some things before going to her friend’s house for a sleep over.

'As she walked past the defendant’s car he leapt out with a silver revolver in his hand and put it to her temple.

'He told her to get in to the car and she did, thinking at first that it was some kind of joke. It soon became apparent that it was not.

'She tried to hide her mobile telephone in her bra but he took it from her and removed the battery.

'She thought she was going to be killed or prostituted and asked if she could send a text to her mother to say she would not be home but this request was refused.

'He asked her age and she told him she was 15. She thought that if she talked calmly to him it would be better for her.'

Despite her terror, the brave teenager managed to talk manic Judge out of killing himself as he wildly snorted cocaine from a key in the front of the vehicle.

The car then stopped in a layby, near Marsden, where Judge sexually assaulted and raped her.

He said women and cocaine had ruined his life and all women deserved to die.

Jailed: Anthony Judge was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection at Leeds Crown Court after admitting kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl

'After raping her he said that he needed to refuel the car but told the girl that he had seven bullets in the gun and would use them on her if she tried any funny business,' added Mrs Taylor.

'At the petrol station she tried to make eye contact with other members of the public and described herself as feeling scared and in shock.

'After setting off they again stopped and again he raped her. This time she asked him if he would use a condom but he refused.

'By this point she was crying and being physically sick. He said I haven’t done anything wrong to you why are you upset.

'Throughout this ordeal she has tried her very best to keep this man calm. He then dropped her off in Huddersfield and said I’m going to leave you here because I’m going to go and kill myself. For what it’s worth I’m sorry.

'She then ran to a nearby hotel where she told two women what had happened they then phoned the police.'

Judge slept rough for two nights before handing himself in at a police station in Congleton, near Manchester.

He told officers 'I believe you are looking for me' and pointed to a gun in the car.

Judge James Spencer QC said: 'You have pleaded guilty to the most horrendous crimes.

'You raped her not once but twice and did not use any protection not withstanding the fact that on the second occasion she asked for it.

'You had no regard for her whatsoever. Afterwards you left her and she had to find someone to help her all the while you were thinking of yourself.

'I have nothing but the utmost admiration for this girl. She is a remarkable, brilliant girl. One wonders what would have happened had she not been so unbelievably calm throughout the process.'

Judge pleaded guilty to two counts of rape, kidnap, sexual assault, assault by penetration and possession of a fire arm at an earlier hearing on August 31.

Along with the indeterminate sentence for public protection, Judge was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from contact with his victim and from anybody under the age of 16 for life.
