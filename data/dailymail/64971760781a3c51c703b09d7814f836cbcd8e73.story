Steve McClaren has revealed how he once gave Louis Van Gaal a bouquet of flowers ahead of a match as a tactic to win a vital three points and clinch Champions League football for FC Twente.

Van Gaal had guided AZ Alkmaar to the Eredivisie title in 2009 when he travelled to play McClaren’s side at the start of May.

Twente needed a victory to secure second place ahead of Ajax and McClaren reckoned that lavishing the famously fierce Dutchman and his team with praise might soften them up ahead of the encounter. The 'tulips trick' seemed to work as Twente won 3-0 and finished one point better off then Ajax.

Successful: Van Gaal has won titles with AZ Alkmaar in the Eredivisie and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga

‘I’ve come across him many times and remember every game,’ McClaren said of the new Manchester United manager. ‘He’s actually the only man I’ve given flowers to.

‘He was with AZ while I was with Twente, they were first and we were second and they had won the league the previous week with two or three games to go.

‘We had to win the game to finish second. We thought, he’s won the league - we'll shower him with all good wishes and try and get him in a nicer mood and his team a little more relaxed than normal.

‘So we gave a procession, congratulated them on winning the championship and in Holland you don't get bottles of champagne, you get flowers. Every time you win something, retire, they give you a bunch of flowers. So I gave Louis a bunch of flowers. We won 3-0. That got us into the Champions League.’

McClaren also gave Van Gaal credit for the modern day Bayern Munich. The Derby County boss added: ‘He's great. I came across him in Germany with Bayern Munich and the way they are playing now – he started it.

‘He’s a very good coach, very good manager, knows what he wants. He's done it at every club - Manchester United is the perfect fit for him.’
