Centre of breach: Spies created a fake Facebook account for Nato's Supreme Allied Commander, Admiral James Stavridis (above) in a bid to steal private information from his friends

Nato's most senior commander has been embroiled in a major security alert after a fake Facebook account was set up in his name by ‘Chinese spies’.

Senior British military officers and Ministry of Defence staff are understood to have accepted ‘friend requests’ from a bogus account for Nato’s Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis.

In the mistaken belief they had linked up with the American admiral on the site, they then unwittingly provided a treasure trove of personal details – including pictures, phone numbers and email addresses.

Nato will not officially say who was behind the cyber-fraud or who accepted friend requests but it is understood that evidence points to Chinese state-sponsored hackers.

Admiral Stavridis – who was in charge of operations in Libya to bring about the end of Colonel Gaddafi’s regime – now has an official Facebook page, while the bogus one has been permanently deleted from the internet.

Although spies are unlikely to have found any genuine military secrets, it is not known how much information was harvested and any personal details could be used to create profiles of targets for blackmail or espionage.

Officials at SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, confirmed the admiral had been targeted.

A spokesman said: ‘This type of compromising attempt is called “social engineering” and has nothing to do with hacking or espionage.

‘Discussions/chats/postings on Facebook are of course only about unclassified topics.’

A Nato official added: ‘There have been several fake Supreme Allied Commander pages. We are not aware that they are Chinese. Facebook has co-operated in taking them down.’

Nato officials asked the networking site to remove the fake page last year. Facebook said false accounts have very different footprints from normal users and are identified using the most sophisticated techniques.

An MoD spokesman said:  ‘We issue guidance on the risks and benefits of channels such  as Facebook.’

The fake Facebook account is the latest tactic in the use of the internet to spy on key figures, with an increasing fear that Chinese intelligence agencies are using ‘electronic warfare’ to target not just military secrets but every aspect of western life.

Information allegedly stolen by hackers includes secrets of stealth aircraft, submarine technology, the space programme and solar energy.

A Facebook spokesman said: 'We removed the profile for violating our terms within a business day of receiving a report.'
