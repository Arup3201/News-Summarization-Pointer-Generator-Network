In a moment of calm before the storm, a priest blesses the runners and riders who are about to take part in an historic race that has been held in an Italian city for hundreds of years.

The Palio medieval race has been held twice a year, every year, almost without fail since the mid-1600s.

A total of 10 riders from Siena's 17 districts, or contrade, race bareback around the shell-shaped central square in the city in a bid to win the Palio, a silk banner depicting the Madonna and child.

The only rule in the competition is that the jockeys must not grab the reins of their adversaries - whipping a rival's horse or even knocking a jockey off his steed is allowed.

Unsurprisingly, it is not uncommon for a number of the jockeys to be thrown off their horses as they navigate the treacherous turns.

Victory goes to the first horse to complete three laps of the square, even if it arrives at the finishing post without a rider.

The Palio held today is named Palio di Provenzano, in honour of the Madonna of Provenzano, who has a church in Siena.

The race is the culmination of ongoing rivalry between the contrade

The origins of the race are believed to come from the medieval period when the piazza would have been the site of a number of public games, mainly combative.

Public races were organised by the contrade from the 14th century but they generally went across the city.

When bullfighting was outlawed by the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1590, the contrade started to organise the races in Piazza del Campo.

Originally races were held on buffalos, while the first modern Palio on horseback took place in 1656.

The race however is more than simply sport - it is the culmination of ongoing rivalry between the contrade.
