A 37-year-old woman allegedly kept skeleton parts in her flat so she could have sex with them.

The Swedish woman is suspected of using 100 parts, which included six skulls and one backbone, in ‘sexual situations’ and was charged with violating the peace of the deceased, prosecutors said.

Police also allegedly found CDs titled ‘My Necrophilia’ and ‘My first experience’ as well as photos in which a woman is seen kissing and hugging the skulls, reported Swedish news agency TT.

In her flat: Police also allegedly found CDs titled 'My Necrophilia' and 'My first experience' as well as photos in which a woman is seen kissing and hugging the skulls

The woman, who comes from south-western Sweden, was charged at Gothenburg District Court today, but has denied the allegations - claiming she collected the bones out of historical interest.

The Goeteborgsposten newspaper alleged that she wrote on an 
internet forum a few years ago: ‘My morals set my limits and I'm 
prepared to take the punishment if something should happen.

'It's worth 
it. I want my man like he 
is, whether he is dead or alive. He allows me to find sexual happiness 
on the side.’

Photos from a morgue were found hidden in the woman's home, as well as a drill and body bags, reported French news agency AFP. But police have found no proof that she was a grave-digger.

'Previous comments': The woman allegedly wrote on an internet forum a few years ago: 'My morals set my limits and I'm prepared to take the punishment if something should happen. It's worth it'

The woman, who has admitted that the 
items were kept in her apartment but denies doing anything wrong, was 
arrested in September and faces up to two years in jail if found guilty.

'I want my man like he is, whether he is dead or alive. He allows me to find sexual happiness on the side'

What woman 'wrote on an internet forum'

'Some of the photos show a woman 
licking a skull,' prosecutor Kristina Ehrenborg-Staffas told The Local newspaper in Sweden. 'We claim it’s her, but she claims it's someone else and she found the 
pictures on the internet.'

She sold three skulls and a spine to a 
person in Uppsala earlier this year, prosecutors said.

An 
access code to a morgue was also said to have been found in her 
apartment by detectives.
