An American cinema chain has unveiled a new line of wines based on hit cannibal film, The Silence of the Lambs.

In the 1991 thriller serial killer Hannibal Lecter famously boasts of eating a victim's liver 'with some fava beans and a nice chianti'.

Now The Alamo Drafthouse, which last year released a Princess Bride tribute wine called The Bottle of Wits, has released The Cannibal Chianti and the Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio - a nod to the Buffalo Bill character in the movie. 

The Alamo Drafthouse has released The Cannibal Chianti and the Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio in tribute to The Silence of the Lambs, which features Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter

Alamo founder Tim League said: 'Even before we launched the “Bottle of Wits” series last year, we knew we had to reference what is in my opinion the most iconic wine moment in movie history, Hannibal Lecter’s now famous food pairing advice.'

The Italian-grown Cannibal Chianti comes from a vineyard situated between Florence and Sienna.

It is a blend of 85 per cent Sangiovese balanced with smaller contributions of Canaiolo and Malvasia del Chianti.

The producers say the nose is loaded with a dark berry fruit with bass notes of allspice and baked quince.

It is a medium-bodied wine with savory plum and tobacco leaf notes and a 'slight sandalwood finish'.

The Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio is a 2012 vintage with a mixture of fruit from California's Central Coast and inland vineyards.

Producers say it offers 'a lush bouquet of tangerine and orange blossom'. 

The palate starts with a crisp entry and a velvety mouth feel that 'bursts into flavors of tropical peach and Mexican limes with just a hint of honey, leading to a zesty, citrus-laced finish'.

Both wines cost $32 and will be available online and at select Alamo Drafthouse locations.

A limited number of packaged wine sets will be available for purchase online only.

The Cannibal Chianti set comes with a leather red dragon bag of fava beans with a recipe for their preparation by Alamo Chef Trish Eichelberger. 

The Suit Yourself Pinot Grigio set features a burlap bag containing a bottle of Buffalo Bill lotion.
