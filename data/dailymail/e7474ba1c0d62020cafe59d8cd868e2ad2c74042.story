Mark Philllips (pictured) died after his safety wire was apparently cut when he was being rescued by an RAF Sea King

A crew member on an RAF Sea King is believed to have cut a safety rope carrying an injured climber they were trying to rescue.

Mark Phillips, 51, a council worker from Spean Bridge, Lochaber, was killed when he fell during the rescue operation after being involved in an accident on Ben Nevis.

He was climbing with a friend when he fell 160ft from Raeburn's Buttress on the north face of the 4,406ft peak on Monday, suffering serious head injuries.

He survived the initial accident but 
when a team from Lossiemouth tried to winch him to safety the safety rope was 
allegedly cut before he had been secured and he fell to his death, according to the Scottish Herald.

As he was being winched to safety by the Sea King helicopter he suddenly dropped to the ground. It is not clear how Mark fell to his death but police have confirmed he died during the rescue attempt.

It is not known how far he fell but it 
is understood to have been hundreds of 
feet. It was reported that in the attempt to get Mr Phillips on board 
the aircraft, the safety rope was cut before he had been secured and 
brought on to the helicopter.

Northern Constabulary and officials from the Ministry of Defence have now 
launched an inquiry into what happened.

Officers
were alerted to the accident at 12.30pm on Monday and a team from 
Lochaber Mountain Rescue went to the scene along with the RAF 
helicopter.

The RAF helicopter 
was immediately stood down from the mission and a Royal Navy helicopter 
from HMS Gannet at Prestwick was called to complete the rescue.

Mr Phillips, an experienced climber, 
was an environmental health officer with Highland Council, based at Fort
William, where he worked for 12 years.

His wife Caroline said in a statement: 'On 25th February my beloved husband, Mark, was enjoying the superb conditions the Scottish Highlands were affording.

'He had spent the previous few days 
climbing and walking in the hills with friends. Tragically that day he 
sustained fatal injuries following an incident on Ben Nevis.

'Mark and I together with our son, 
Ruaridh, had moved to the Highlands about 12 years ago so as to live 
amongst the hills and community we had got to love.

'Mark
was a loving father and husband and will be sorely missed by us and his
many friends and work colleagues. Ruaridh and I thank them all for 
their support.

'I have 
noted certain speculation in the press surrounding Mark's death. I have 
entire confidence in the police and the process and I do not want to 
indulge such speculation.'

Police are taking statements from all those involved in the incident, including members of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team.

A climber who helped in the rescue 
effort blamed the accident on 'basic human error' and 
said there was a lot of sympathy for the winchman, who is understood to 
be a long-serving airman who has successfully rescued hundreds of people
from the mountains.

The helicopter was scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth and the MoD is now carrying out an inquiry

Local 
reports suggested there had been 'tense radio exchanges' moments before 
the accident before an order was issued for radio silence.

'Mark and I together with our son, Ruaridh, had moved to the Highlands about 12 years ago so as to live amongst the hills and community we had got to love. Mark was a loving father and husband and will be sorely missed by us and his many friends and work colleagues'

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 
'We can confirm that two military search and rescue helicopters were 
sent to assist in an operation to rescue a fallen climber on Ben Nevis, 
who sadly died.

'An investigation by Northern 
Constabulary is under way. It would be inappropriate for the MoD to 
comment further at this stage.'

Spokesmen from both the police force and the MoD declined to comment further on whether the rescue line was cut by a crewman.

Officers from Northern Constabulary have taken statements from mountain rescue team members and the Ministry of Defence has also started an internal inquiry.

The climber was roped to a friend when he first fell more than 160ft from Raeburn's Buttress on the north face of the peak on Monday afternoon but was saved by his safety rope.

It is understood his companion did not suffer any serious injuries.

A spokesman for the Northern 
Constabulary said: 'This is a live inquiry which is being investigated 
by the police. We would never reveal the details of the circumstances 
surrounding the death.

'There are no further details at this time. A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.'

Mark Phillips was the 11th person to 
die on Scotland's mountains in less than two months. Graham Paterson, 
60, of Skye, was found after falling in the Cuillins on December 29.

Tom
Chesters, 28, Chris Bell, 24, Dr Una Finnegan, 25, and Dr Rachel 
Majumdar, 29, died on January 19 when they were avalanched in Glencoe 
and Ben St Joseph died after falling 400ft from Tower Ridge on Ben Nevis
on January 26.

An avalanche
in the Cairngorms a fortnight ago killed Squadron Leader Rimon Than, 
33, Fit Lt Fran Capps, 32, and William Currie, 18. Graham Connell, 31, 
from Yorkshire, was found dead in the Cairngorms on February 18.

The leader of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team has described the initial fall on the mountain.

John Stevenson said: 'It was a bad fall. We think he was the lead climber because his mate was on the rope. He saw him fall - as did two other climbers in the area - and he abseiled down and raised the alarm by mobile phone.

'The lad who fell had massive head injuries. We sent a team of 18 and used every asset available. Accidents do happen. All it needs is one mistake and in a split second you are gone.'

Neil Gillies, director of transport environmental and community services at the council where Mr Phillips worked, said: 'Mark covered the full range of Environmental Health Activities including Food Safety. 

'He was a popular, helpful and highly valued member of our team in Lochaber and always went about his business in an efficient and professional manner.  He will be sorely missed.'

Provost of Lochaber, councillor Allan Henderson said: 'I am extremely saddened to hear about the passing of our valued colleague.  

'As Councillors, we have always found Mark to be very courteous and helpful and a very valued member of the Highland Council staff.  His death will be sadly mourned by his colleagues as well as his family.'
