The Government's eavesdropping agency GCHQ is to give a parliamentary committee full details of its links to a controversial US internet monitoring programme, it has been revealed.

The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) will receive a report on claims that it received material through the secret Prism scheme 'very shortly', according to chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind.

He said: 'The ISC is aware of the allegations surrounding data obtained by GCHQ via the US Prism programme.

'The ISC will be receiving a full report from GCHQ very shortly and will decide what further action needs to be taken as soon as it receives that information.'

MPs from the ISC will also seek reassurances from Washington that US spies are not snooping on the emails of British webs users on a trip to the US next week.

Sinister powers: Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, based in Cheltenham, Gloucs., is largely responsible for monitoring the phone calls and emails of terror suspects

The ISC is going on a week long tour of the US and will meet senior figures from US intelligence agencies.

The development comes after it was claimed yesterday that British spies had access to the Prism system.

Secret documents published yesterday 
suggest the US National Security Agency (NSA) has direct access to data 
held by internet giants including Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, 
YouTube, Skype and Apple.

The
 documents – which appear to be slides from a 41-page training presentation for 
intelligence agents – suggest the agency can access email, photographs, 
social network information, chat records and other ‘stored data’ held by
 the companies, as part of its ‘Prism’ project.

They also suggest the British 
government’s listening centre, GCHQ, has had access to the system since 
at least June 2010.

The project generated nearly 200 
intelligence reports in the 12 months to May 2012, a 137 per cent increase on the previous year.

It is unclear whether other agencies, such as MI5 
and MI6, were also involved, meaning the true extent of the snooping 
could be higher.

A GCHQ spokesman said ‘we do not 
comment on intelligence matters’, but added: ‘Our work is carried out in
 accordance with a strict legal and policy framework.’

Privacy campaigners warned that the 
revelations suggested the creation of a ‘Snooper’s Charter by the back 
door’.

They come after a proposed plan to pay internet companies to 
collate user data from UK computers was dropped only last month in the 
face of opposition from Tory backbenchers and Liberal Democrats.

Pressure: The disclosure will pile pressure on David Cameron to explain how much he knew about the intrusion as he prepares to attend the secretive Bilderberg conference today, a closed-door meeting that conspiracy theorists already believe is where leaders plot world domination

I know what you're doing this summer: The Obama administration defended the order on Thursday, calling it 'a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats'

'Reprehensible': Director of National Intelligence James Clapper branded the program 'reprehensible' and said it risks Americans' security

Last night Labour called on David 
Cameron to come clean to MPs on the extent of Britain’s role. 

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'It is important for the UK intelligence community to be able to gather information from abroad including from the United States, particularly in the vital counter-terror work they do.

'However, there also have to be legal safeguards in place, including proper protection for British citizens' privacy, proper oversight and checks and balances to make sure intelligence powers are not misused.

'And the public need confidence that their privacy is being properly respected and protected.

'That is why the Prime Minister, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, and all the intelligence agencies should provide full information to the Intelligence and Security Committee as swiftly as possible, and the ISC should have full support to pursue this and report.'

The Guardian said it obtained the slides from a whistleblowing intelligence officer worried about invasions of privacy.

According to the newspaper, the Prism programme appeared to allow GCHQ to circumvent the formal legal process required to obtain personal material, such as emails, photographs and videos, from internet companies based outside the UK.

Reports by the paper and The 
Washington Post suggested the FBI and the NSA can tap directly into the 
central servers of nine leading internet companies.

But a number of 
them, including Google, Apple, Yahoo and Facebook denied the government 
had ‘direct access’ to their servers.

Microsoft said it does not voluntarily
 participate in any government data collection and only complies ‘with 
orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers’.

Yet one slide appears to be a timeline
 of when the companies began to participate in Prism, starting with 
Microsoft in September 2007 and ending with Apple in October 2012.

According to the reports, Prism was 
established under President Bush in 2007 and has grown ‘exponentially’ 
under President Obama.

Bombshell: NSA and FBI have been extracting audio, video, photos, e-mails, documents and other data from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Skype, AOL and PalTalk

Key source: PRISM has been described by NSA officials 'as the most prolific contributor to the president's Daily Brief,' providing analysts with a wealth of 'raw material'

Classified: The particulars of the PRISM data-mining program have been outlined in a top-secret PowerPoint presentation for senior intelligence analysts, which ended up being leaked

Participants: This graph shows when each of the nine tech companies joined PRISM, with Apple being the latest addition in October 2012

Spying: The NSA has been getting millions of phone records from Verizon on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order, that was only revealed today

Plundered: The NSA and FBI have been pulling personal data directly from the mainframes of top US tech giants, including YouTube, Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Verizon for the past six years

The Director of US National 
Intelligence said that the law ensures that only ‘non-US persons outside
 the US are targeted’, raising the likelihood that Britons are among 
those captured in its net.

Emma Carr, of Big Brother Watch, said:
 ‘We already have laws which allow law enforcement officials to request 
information about British citizens using American services.

‘If these laws are being circumvented by using these NSA spying arrangements then that would be a very serious issue.’

Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said: 'These reports suggest a breach of trust on the grandest scale with the US Government, Internet Service Providers and our own UK intelligence community showing contempt for privacy, legality and democracy itself.

'Don't we still believe that spies should be accountable to the public they serve and protect?

'This is the kind of arrogance behind the attempted "snoopers' charter". Have those who failed to persuade in the Parliament chamber decided to smuggle blanket surveillance in through the back door?'

Revelations about the snooping 
programme follow separate reports about the NSA being allowed to collect
 all telephone user data from Verizon, one of the largest telephone 
firms in the US, for three months.

Set up by Harry Truman in 
1953, the NSA is the eyes and ears of America across the globe, 
intercepting 1.7 billion emails, phone calls a day’.

It
 is the the secretive body that serves the military and intelligence 
communities by collecting all forms of foreign communications to prevent
 attacks on the US.

It was 
prohibited by law from intercepting domestic communications without a 
warrant until George W. Bush issued a caveat in the wake of 9/11 under the controversial 'terrorist surveillance program'.

Nonetheless, over the years the NSA has been engulfed in a number of snooping scandals.

They
 include President Nixon's illegal wiretapping, through the NSA, of five
 members of his national security staff, two newsmen, and a staffer at 
the Department of Defense in a bid to uncover who was leaking 
information about his plans for the Vietnam War.

In
 2005 it was revealed George W Bush had authorized the NSA to eavesdrop 
on Americans calling abroad without warrants in a bid to thwart 
terrorism. He strenuously denied the allegations until he finally 
conceded he had committed an impeachable offense.

And in 2009, under President Obama, the US Department of Justice acknowledged
 the NSA had gone beyond its remit in tapping the phonelines of American
 citizens, including a Congressman, but claimed that the acts were 
unintentional and had since been rectified.

Last month, it was accused of building an £800million cyber base to keep tabs on American citizens.

The state-of-the-art data centre in the Utah desert – codenamed Bumblehive – is intended to bolster online security efforts.

But former employees say it could be used to monitor people’s private emails.

The
 NSA branded the allegations 'unfounded', adding that it remained 'unwavering' in its respect for
 U.S. laws and American citizens' civil liberties, and noted that it was
 subject to broad oversight by all three branches of government.
