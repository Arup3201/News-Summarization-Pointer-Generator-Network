For Fabio Capello it must have seemed like deja vu as Igor Akinfeev spilled the ball into his own net during Russia's World Cup opener against South Korea.

What seemed like a fairly tepid 25-yard effort from Lee Keun-Ho turned into an absolute disaster as Akinfeev let it slip through his hands to see his side go 1-0 behind.

Memories for Capello must have immediately turned to one thing - Robert Green.

VIDEO Russia and South Korea end in stalemate  

Four years ago in South Africa, England were 1-0 up in their opening World Cup game against the USA and cruising.

Then, goalkeeper Green, surprisingly selected ahead of the experienced David James, had an absolutely shocker, letting a routine 20-yard effort from Clint Demspey slip through his fingers in the 40th minute.

England drew, Rob Green was dropped and their campaign never recovered.

This time round for the Italian manager it was slightly different, the horror slip put them 1-0 behind, before Alexander Kerzakhov rescued a point with 15 minutes to go.

Capello, though, will be bemoaning his luck, and wondering how the same stuff can happen to the same guy twice.
