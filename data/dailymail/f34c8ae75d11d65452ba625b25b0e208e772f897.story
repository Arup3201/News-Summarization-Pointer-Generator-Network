A police officer who fired a Taser at a man covered in petrol who then burst into flames could face criminal charges over the death.

Andrew Pimlott, 32, was confronted by two officers in his back garden in Plymouth last year after they were called to reports of a domestic disturbance.

During the confrontation Mr Pimlott, who had doused himself in petrol, burst into flames after being hit the with the stun gun. He died five days later from his burns.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an investigation into Andrew’s death on April 18 last year and today announced that a file had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider charges.

A spokesman said: ‘Two police officers were called to an address in the Honicknowle area on 18 April 2013 following an emergency call from an occupant.

‘The caller advised that Mr Pimlott, 32, was in the garden with a can of flammable liquid.

‘Shortly after the police arrived, Mr Pimlott sustained serious burn injuries and an ambulance and fire brigade were called.

‘An officer deployed a Taser during the incident. Mr Pimlott was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and subsequently transferred to the burns unit at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

‘He died in hospital on 23 April from his injuries.’

The spokesman said Devon and Cornwall Police had referred Andrew’s death to the IPCC themselves, in line with force protocol.

He added: ‘The IPCC interviewed both officers who attended along with other witnesses. The investigation has also gathered views from expert witnesses.

‘The IPCC has now concluded its investigation and sent a file to the Crown Prosecution Service regarding the actions of the one officer who deployed the Taser.

‘It will now be for the CPS to determine whether any criminal charges are merited.’

Police guidance on the use of Tasers advises officers there is a risk of fire where a person is doused with petrol, suggesting that officers factor this in when deciding whether to use the stun gun

According to a 2008 document by the Association of Chief Police Officers on the deployment of Tasers, the Home Office Scientific Development Branch ‘demonstrated that there is a risk of flammability if someone has already been sprayed with an incapacitant containing a flammable solvent.’

The guidance says: ‘Clearly, there is also a risk of flammability where the subjects’ clothing is doused with other flammable liquids.

‘These might include, but are not limited to, lighter fuel, petrol and strong alcoholic spirits.

‘This heightened risk must be factored in when assessing the “appropriateness” and “necessity” of using a Taser.

‘It is however recognised that there are circumstances where the only alternative may be a more injurious level of force, or where activation of the Taser, irrespective of the additional risk, is absolutely necessary to protect life.’

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: ‘We have cooperated fully with the investigation and we await the decision of the CPS.’
