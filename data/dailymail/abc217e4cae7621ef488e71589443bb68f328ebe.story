The one-child policy in China can lead to an intensely close relationship between parents and offspring.

This can make it difficult for parents to cut ties when their children move hundreds of miles away to start their first term in university

So when term starts children are not only personally delivered to their new university by their proud parents, but they often stay on for a few days to make sure their offspring have a friendly face to hand as they start their new lives as students.

Parents of students at Shenyang Aerospace University in the city of Shenyang in north-eastern China sleep on the gym floor so that they can be near their offspring in the first few days of term 

Shenyang Aerospace University's gymnasium was made available to 400 parents who were also given straw mats to sleep on

Many are from poor families who cannot afford the inflated hotel prices during the start of university term, and with the struggle to pay costs associated with sending their children to further education, a room is a luxury many are prepared to do without.

As a result universities have now been increasingly turning some of the buildings over to parents who want to stay around for the first few days of their children's life.

Crowded but happy: Chinese students' parents try to sleep on straw mats to be near their children 

Water, water: University  authorities give parents a drink as they try to get some sleep on the gym fllor

These photographs were taken at the start of the current academic year on September 1 at the Shenyang Aerospace University in the city of Shenyang in Liaoning, north-eastern China, where the gymnasium was made available to 400 parents who were also given straw mats to sleep on so that they can have an extended farewell with their children.

The gesture was praised by students and other people on the Chinese social media website Weibo, although many other universities around the country are also offering the same service.
