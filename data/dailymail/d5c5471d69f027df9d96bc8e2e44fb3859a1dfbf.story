A Denver TSA agent accused of sexually assaulting a mother escorting her daughter to a flight will not be prosecuted, district attorneys announced Wednesday.

Jamelyn Steenhoek claims a Denver International Airport security agent extensively grabbed and groped her during two searches December 26 and left her feeling violated.

When she learned the agent would not be charged, the 39-year-old mom said it made her feel even worse. 'I felt sick to my stomach,' she said.

'I felt sick to my stomach': Jamelyn Steenhoek reacted to news Wednesday that prosecutors would not pursue charges against a female TSA agent she says sexually assaulted her during search

Sick and also helpless, she told CBS Denver.

'Those TSA agents were purposely abusive to me,' she said. 'And there isn’t any recourse. I still feel as if a crime was committed, and as an individual American I am powerless to do anything about it.'

Steenhoek said in an interview with the station that she was escorting her daughter to the Philadelphia-bound flight’s gate when TSA inspectors were alerted by an alarm going off at the security checkpoint.

She says the said her jeans must have been at fault for a beeping metal detector, they had studs on the back pockets. An agent then conducted an explosives swab on her hands.

‘Then they told me I tested positive for explosives,’ she recalled, saying that she told screeners she pumped gas earlier that day and it must have triggered the positive result.

'She said, "We’ll have to do a search." So I thought, "Okay," said Ms Steenhoek.

Checkpoint: The long lines at Denver International Airport as people wait to go through security. Steenhoek was accompanying her 13-year-old daughter to a flight when she was searched twice on December 26

It was the jeans: Steenhoef said studs on the back of her jeans set of an airport metal detector, which initiated the first search

They took her aside and frisked her out in the open like they do any other person singled out for a more thorough search, but Ms Steenhoek says something felt off .

‘She did a pretty invasive search,’ Ms Steenhoek recalled. ‘They are just areas of the body I’m not comfortable being touched in. On the outside of my pants she cupped my crotch. I was uncomfortable with that.

‘The part of the search that bothered most was the breast search. You could tell it shouldn’t take that much groping. To me it was as extensive as an exam from my physician — full touching and grabbing in the front. I felt uncomfortable, I felt violated.’

The agent found nothing – so they took her to a second room and did the search again.

'I don’t understand how a reasonable person would think that this behavior is acceptable,' said Steenhoek, whose daughter stood by and saw the whole thing.

Whether or not investigators believed Steenhoek, they will not pursue the matter.

A spokesperson for the Denver DA's office told CBS Denver that no charges will be filed.

'We would be unable to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt,' Lynn Kimbrough said.

Kimbrough went on to say the DA would not be able to prove the agents conducted the search with an intent to gain gratification, arousal or abuse.

It came back positive: The woman then says an explosives swab similar to this one tested positive - this is where she says the trouble began
