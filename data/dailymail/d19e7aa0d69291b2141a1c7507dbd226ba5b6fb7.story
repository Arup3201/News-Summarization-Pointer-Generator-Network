Sophie Hitchon, the ballet dancer turned hammer thrower, claimed Commonwealth bronze for England at Hampden Park.

The 23-year-old from Burnley hurled the hammer out to 68.72 metres to land her team's third athletics medal of Glasgow 2014.

Canada's Sultana Frizell took the gold in a Games record 71.97m.

Rough start: Hitchon was unhappy with her early throws but she regained her composure to win bronze

Hitchon said: 'I have mixed emotions. I am obviously really ecstatic to get a bronze medal at a major championships, but I felt like I had a lot more in me.

'Maybe I wanted to throw a little bit further today, but that is how it goes sometimes.

'Training has been going really well and I started off okay in the first round, then kind of lost it a little bit going into the middle rounds.

'My last one was a good throw, a decent distance, but just wasn't quite good enough to get a silver medal.

'It is a good stepping stone onto the competition. I've got the European Championships (in Zurich in August) and then the next few years should be good for me.'
