Leaving an expensive device on a plane usually means waving it goodbye forever. 

But one passenger was shocked when airline staff not only returned his lost iPad, but left him a few surprise happy snaps as a souvenir.

Stepan Hruda, from New York, left the device on the plane after flying with Icelandair to Keflavik in Iceland three weeks ago.

Service with a selfie: Passenger Stepan Hruda was surprised to find these humorous selfies on his returned iPad after he left it on an Icelandair flight

After contacting the airline, he was thrilled to learn that it had been located, and collected the device when he arrived to catch his outbound flight.

It was only upon his return to the States that Hruda noticed two extra photographs in the iPad image gallery.

The two cheeky 'selfies' appear to have been snapped by Icelandair cabin and ground crew. 

In the first shot, two female cabin crew members smile broadly for the shot, one clutching a cup of coffee. The second selfie sees two male ground grew wearing Hi Vis vests pulling funny faces.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Hruda revealed that he was a few days into his Icelandic hiking trip before noticing his iPad was missing. 

I don't remember taking that: The airline pranksters found the device after the flight from New York to Keflavik and ensured it was safely returned to its owner - but not before taking some happy snaps

'Great customer experience': Stepan says he's just relieved to get the iPad back and thinks the crew stunt is 'hilarious'

'I didn’t realise I lost the device until two days later, when swimming in a hot pot in the middle of nowhere in Northern Iceland,' he said.

'I was kind of in peace with it being gone, but I got faith in humanity and tweeted to Icelandair about it.

'They got me in touch with the airport police and we resolved that they got my iPad when (I was) still on the road! 

'I picked my iPad up when flying out from Keflavik on another trip to Spain, 10 days after I lost it. I didn’t find the pictures until getting back home to NYC.'

Hruda, an iOS developer, uploaded the humorous images to popular sharing site Reddit seven days ago. The post has gone viral, amassing more than 1.36 million views so far.

'I immediately realised what happened there and thought it was hilarious, so I put them on Reddit and the thread exploded,' Hruda said.

'The two guys from the picture actually got in touch with me through Reddit and Twitter, so I could even thank them in person.'

Some Reddit users pointed out that posting the images online could lead to disciplinary action against the Icelandair crew, but Hruda says that it had not occurred to him - he was just relieved to have his iPad returned.

'I find it amazing and it makes me like IcelandAir even more, so I hope no one gets in trouble for this,' he wrote on Reddit. 

Lost and found: Icelandair promptly returned the iPad after Hruda contacted them, but it is as yet unknown what they make of their employees' prank

'Just to reiterate: This was a great customer experience, I am very happy I got my iPad back and I hope no one gets silly and tries to give these nice employees s*** for it.' 

Hruda's iPad is locked with a passcode, without which potential thieves can only take photos - they cannot access the image gallery or any other content on the device.

MailOnline Travel has contacted Icelandair for comment.
