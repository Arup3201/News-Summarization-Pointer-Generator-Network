If you've ever fallen in love with a piece of clothing and had trouble tracking it down, new technology being developed by the brains behind music identifying app, Shazam, could be the answer to your prayers.

What's more, according to Shazam CEO, Andrew Fisher, the new fashion app isn't far away.

'We have the ability to identify the product in a TV show so that when somebody Shazams it, they could find out where a presenter's dress is from in one click,' Fisher told the Guardian.

'We are focused on creating a new category which we call media engagement. We make it easier for consumers to engage with a brand or a piece of content they are interested in, without having to go through search engines, then mining the results.

'That works with both TV programming and advertising: a 30-second slot can be turned into a three-minute brand engagement â€“ and more.'

The app has also been part of several high profile TV collaborations, most recently during the BRIT Awards ceremony, when users of the app were given special behind-the-scenes access and links to engage directly on Twitter and Facebook.

Fisher revealed that the brand hopes to repeat the trick on a wider scale with a new app that will replace the information button on your remote control and provide content such as cast lists, scripts and tweets from the actors.

'When you use the red [information] 
button, you take over the whole experience for everyone who is watching 
in the room,' explained Fisher.

'With Shazam, individuals can access a
 cast list, details of the soundtrack, read tweets from the actors, 
check out the script, buy onscreen product and a whole lot more on their
 individual mobile devices without disrupting anyone else's viewing.'

The current musical offering from Shazam
 is already one of the most popular apps on the planet, with 20 million 
users in the UK alone according to the company.

Shazam also revealed that the app is 
downloaded by two million new users a week, which means that the fashion
 version will have a lot to live up to when it launches.

Unfortunately for fashion fans 
desperate to get their hands on the new app, Fisher is staying 
tight-lipped on how close to completion the technology is and on when it
 might launch.
