Australia Post has launched a new service that gives local shoppers a U.S. postal address, so they can shop at websites that offer cheaper prices but only deliver within America.

The postal service has set up a warehouse in Oregon that gives Australian consumers a U.S. address to tell online retailers to ship to, before their parcels are forwarded to their Australian address.

The company initiated its ShopMate service last week in order to capitalise on the Christmas gift-buying rush.

A review of clothing items done by consumer group Choice this year found Australians are paying up to 60 percent more than U.S. consumers for exactly the same products.

'Whether it's IT products, cosmetics or clothes, it’s never been easier for Aussie consumers to compare prices between Australia and overseas stores and it's not pretty viewing,' said Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey.

Parcel Post general manager Kelly Heintz says the service will cut the annoying price difference suffered by Australian consumers.

Ms Heintz says the service also means Australians won't have to wait any longer than Americans for products that haven't yet hit local stores.

ShopMate isn't the first service of its kind offered in Australia, but it's the first that won't rely on international couriers that can sometimes be more costly.

Australia Post charges a base rate of $24.95 a parcel, with a weight rate of $5.95 per 500 grams. 

Mr Godfrey said Choice welcomed Australia Post's decision, but said the lengths consumers have to go to avoid being ripped off were 'staggering'.

'The fact that Australia Post can set up a service like this to help people avoid geo-blocking is testament to how broken online shopping is in Australia,' Mr Godfrey said.

'It's time to end digital discrimination down under and stop this farce that sees consumers parcelling up goods overseas to access affordable prices.'
