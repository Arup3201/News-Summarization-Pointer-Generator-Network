The art of foraging for your food is no longer confined to the countryside, according to one top chef. 

Caroline Davey, professional forager and chef is inspiring the nation to explore the UK's best autumn ingredients that can be easily discovered by buildings and built up spaces or picked on country walks. 

City dwellers can go sloe picking in Manchester's parks, discover Peckham's pavement crop of citrus pineapple weeds or head to Likey Hills in Birmingham where bilberries grow plentiful in plain sight.

Outside of cities, intrepid cooks across the countryside are sourcing a variety of ingredients to impress friends and family. 

From cobnuts found in Kentish hedgerows to juicy rosehips hiding along the public foot paths of the Isle of Man and more than 600 varieties of seaweed found along the shores of the UK's coastal towns, the country is brimming with wild foods.

Ms Davey said: 'There are so many ingredients that bloom in autumn and picking a few new flavours can transform a home cooked meal.

'Find your own horseradish as this will spice up any sauce you make to go with beef and look out for wood blewit mushrooms, as these will have a superior flavour to any cultivated mushrooms you can buy.' 

With more choice on offer in the wild, it's not hard to see why Brits are foraging for flavour. 

The UK is home to more than 50 varieties of edible mushrooms compared to just nine on average in the aisles of the weekly shop - but be careful to pick the right ones.

There is also double the number of berries on offer in the British countryside (18 wild varieties versus just five in supermarkets).

Not content with just swapping pre-packaged varieties of autumn favourites such as blackberries, mushrooms and greens, Brits are uncovering new delicacies to replace the greengrocer staples. 

Alexis Byron, Brand Manager of Gallo Family Vineyards, that commissioned the foraging trend study, said: 'Autumn is the perfect time to embrace seasonal dishes with an abundance of fruits and vegetables on our doorstep.

'What better way to cosy up this season than to create your own, handpicked, handmade dish.'
