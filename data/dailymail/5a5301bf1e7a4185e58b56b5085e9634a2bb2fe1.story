Rapist: Jason O’Dell was jailed two years ago after imprisoning his terrified victim for two weeks

A rapist serving a life sentence in prison managed to post an advert in a lonely hearts column, it was revealed today.

Jason O’Dell was jailed two years ago after imprisoning his terrified victim for two weeks - repeatedly raping her, beating her and leaving her with broken ribs and a broken nose.

The 45-year-old from Wymondham, Norfolk, stubbed out cigarettes on her body before forcing her to clean her own blood off the floor and dye her hair in a bid to cover up the assault.

O’Dell - who has a long history of violence against women - has now sparked further outrage by announcing he is looking for love in the small ads of a biker’s magazine.

Under the name ‘Biker Bloke’, the advert said: ‘45, Stocky build, serving life in prison, looking for penfriend, interests are live music, camping & rallies.

‘Write to Jason O’Dell, A7324AR, HMP Bure, Norwich, Norfolk, NR10 5GB.’

The Prison Service said an investigation had been ordered and the advert in ‘Back Street Heroes’ had now been removed.

But this was not before it was first spotted by a woman whose friend was killed in a horrific murder - and she alerted the magazine.

The woman said: ‘I know the people who run the magazine and told them about it. They were very concerned and won’t allow it to go in again.

‘I think it’s disgusting this man may leave prison with 100 addresses. I find it insulting to his victims that he has been allowed to do this.’

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Any prisoner wishing to participate in a pen pal scheme must seek permission from the governor of the prison before they can do so.

‘There are clear instructions on the content of any correspondence, which can also be monitored.

‘If a member of the public receives unwanted mail from a prisoner and complains, we can and will prevent any further attempts to contact that person.

‘Robust measures are taken against anyone who flouts the rules. An investigation is being conducted into this instance and the advert has been removed.’

O’Dell was convicted of three rapes, two counts of actual bodily harm and two counts of assault by beating at Norwich Crown Court.

He was also found guilty of affray and damaging the victim’s property and was ordered in March 2013 to serve a minimum of nine years in jail.

His victim told the court she had lost her job as a result of her ordeal and been forced to move away from her home.

She said: ‘I only met him in July last year. I didn’t plan to get into a relationship with him but I was helpless against his mind games.

‘From the moment I met him, I had a feeling deep down that something bad was going to happen but didn’t know what to do to stop it.

‘I’m a strong person but he completely messed my head up.’

The court heard O’Dell had 20 previous convictions for 79 offences. In 2006 he was jailed for three years for regularly beating up another ex-girlfriend.
