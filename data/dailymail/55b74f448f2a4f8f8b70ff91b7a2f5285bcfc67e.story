Laura Robson will be a notable absentee on the court at Wimbledon this year.

Twelve months ago she became the first British woman to reach the last 16 at SW19 in 15 years.

A longstanding wrist injury disappointingly denies the popular 20-year-old her place in the competition this time round, however, with Heather Watson and Johanna Konta among the British women left to fly the flag.

But the former British No 1, who will be a part of the BBC's commentary team this year, should be encouraged by one statistic, at least: the average age of a Grand Slam champion is 24.

According to new research by Virgin Active, future Grand Slam champions will hit the ball a staggering 2.4million times by the time they reach the golden age of 24; equivalent to 100,000 strokes-a-year.

The study also suggests that top players would have spent three years of their life on the courts at the same age, covering 2,496 miles and burning more than 936,000 calories - which equates to the large number of 3,505 bowls of strawberries and cream for armchair fans.

Robson is an ambassador for the new ‘Active Aces’ programme and was pictured covered in tennis balls to launch the initiative that is aimed to inspire the next generation of budding British talent.

'That a professional player has spent three years of their life on court by the time they are 24 shows how much dedication is needed to become a world-class player,' said Great Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith.

'It also shows that it’s important for children to start playing the sport young.'

Indeed, Robson will be keen to make up the numbers when she returns to full fitness soon with next year's Australian Open her likely Grand Slam comeback date.

'I don't actually know my recovery timescale,' said the British No 2, speaking last week.

'The most important thing is not to rush it.

'I kept trying to come back too soon, and that kept making it worse.'

Big time: Robson is an ambassador for Virgin Active to help get more youngsters playing tennis
