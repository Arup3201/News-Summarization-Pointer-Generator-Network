A father of two died in front of his wife and sons after he got caught in dangerous conditions while swimming off the coast of Lanzarote.

Ciarán Brown was pulled unconscious from the water by lifeguards but desperate attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful.

The 44-year-old was on holiday with his wife, Celine and sons Ciarán and Eoin, and the family had been due to return to Dublin from the Spanish island today.

Family man: Ciaran Brown, who drowned this weekend after he got into difficulty while swimming in rough waters off Lanzarote, with his son, also called Ciaran, and his wife Celine

One local said the waters off Playa Blanca, in the resort of Puerto del Carmen, were ‘like hell’ at the time of the tragedy.

It is understood that red flags were up on the beach warning bathers to stay out of the water .

Volunteer
ambulance workers tried to revive Mr Brown as his family frantically 
tried to fetch more help. Two ambulances, local police and the Civil 
Guard also came to the scene.

Paramedics
spent 40 minutes trying to resuscitate the Ballyfermot man but he was 
pronounced dead at the scene on Saturday afternoon.

A
spokesman for Emerlan, the  island’s volunteer emergency service, said:
‘The waters were extremely dangerous at the time, which is  why the red
flag was flying.

‘It is a 
terrible tragedy. Our volunteers did their best to save his life while 
waiting for the ambulance service to arrive but sadly they were unable 
to save his life.

‘My 
understanding is he was on holiday and the tragedy happened in front of 
his wife and children but we do not have any more details.’

The
emergency services in the Canary Islands said in a statement: ‘We 
received a phone call telling us a man had been pulled from the sea. The
team from Emerlan found him in cardiac arrest and tried to reanimate 
him.

‘Our paramedics took over when they arrived in two ambulances. But they had no success and pronounced him dead.’

One
local, writing on a local newspaper website, said of the conditions 
when Mr Brown got into trouble: ‘The sea was like hell... so crazy.’

Another wrote: ‘The beach was flying the red flag, I passed by there and I saw it...

‘Rest in peace and strength to the family.’

It is the second tragedy to befall the family after they lost a son, Michael ‘Brownie’ Brown, in an accident in 2009.

Last night, tributes to Ciarán Brown flooded into the family from family and friends.

On
the Facebook page of his son Ciarán Jr, one friend wrote: ‘Sorry to 
hear the news pal head up thoughts and prayers are with you and your 
family.’

Another wrote: ‘Don’t even know what to say...

‘Just want you  to know we’re all here and your dad was a gentleman, a true legend that not one of us will ever forget.’

Other friends and family wrote emotional farewells to Mr Brown who was described as a ‘gent’ and ‘one in a million’.

One
friend wrote: ‘I’ve no even words to say... other that I’m shocked to 
hear the news... He was a legend but he was mostly a gentleman. I’m 
always here as always if ya need me pal.’

Friends of the family posted pictures of the father online as news  of his death spread yesterday.

Paradise: Lanzarote, one of the seven Canary Islands, boasts a volcanic moonscape and exotic beaches

A
spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said they had not as of
yet been in touch with the family.

The tragedy comes five years after 
another Dublin man died in the same resort.

Tallaght man Keith Murphy drowned in Puerto del Carmen after travelling there with two friends for a wedding and holiday.

He had been enjoying a night with a number of friends when he got into difficulty in the pool. It was his first holiday abroad.

Resort
manager Jose Carlos Fernandes said at the time it was clear the death 
was a tragic accident. Lanzarote is known for its stark beauty.

It
boasts a striking volcanic moonscape in the centre and the south of the
island, where Mr Brown died, is home to some of the best beaches.
