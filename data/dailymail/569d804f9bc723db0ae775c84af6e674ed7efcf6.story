Public health officials are urging the public to spend short bursts in the sun from April to October to ensure they get enough Vitamin D.

NICE, the health watchdog, has issued guidance which says Vitamin D is crucial for protecting the bones, yet figures show that 1 in 6 adults are deficient.

The guidelines do not specify how long but previously experts have recommended that 13 minutes between 11am and 3pm in summer would be sufficient. 

Health watchdog NICE now advises people to go out for short bursts in the sun from April to October, to ensure they get enough Vitamin D for strong bones. One in six adults is deficient in Vitamin D, NICE warns

Professor Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive and director of health and social care at NICE, said: ‘Although exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays for too long can increase your risk of developing skin cancer, being out in the sun can be good for you too – it provides both a good source of vitamin D and the opportunity to be physically active.

‘A balance needs to be struck. This depends on a number of factors including geographical location, time of day and year, weather conditions, natural skin colour and time spent in the sun.”

‘Those likely to be at higher risk of skin cancer include people with lighter skin who may burn more easily, as well as babies and people who work outside.

‘People at higher risk of having low levels of vitamin D, include those with darker skin, pregnant women, children, older adults, and people who don’t get much sun exposure.’

Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘It’s important to enjoy the sun safely, by striking the right balance between making vitamin D while not increasing the risk of skin cancer.

‘Most people should make enough vitamin D during the UK summer through short, regular exposures to the sun, without getting sunburnt. 

'But everyone’s skin reacts differently to the sun, so there isn’t a one size fits all recommendation.’

Conversely, the watchdog is also urging the public to avoid using phrases such as ‘healthy tans’ and ‘escaping to the sun’ as they undermine the dangers of skin cancer.

Conversely, NICE is urging people to avoid using phrases such as 'healthy tans' and 'escaping to the sun' as they undermine the dangers of skin cancer. People assume they are fully protected by suncream when this isn't the case, particularly if cream isn't applied to all areas of the skin or washes off after going swimming

It has issued guidance calling for better awareness of the risks posed by spending even short periods in the sun.

Officials are particularly worried that adults and teenagers who sunbathe here or abroad assume they are fully protected by suncream.

This isn’t the case – the watchdog points out – particularly if cream isn’t applied to all areas of the skin or washes off after going in the pool or sea.

Rates of the most deadly form of skin cancer have quadrupled since the 1970s, partly due to the popularity of package holidays and sunbeds.

There are 13,300 new cases in the UK every year leading to around 2,100 deaths.

The guidance states that adverts or pictures in newspapers and magazine should avoid references to ‘healthy tans’ or ‘escaping to the sun.’
