A Russian MP is making a bid to buy 
the house where Adolf Hitler was born to destroy it - thus thwarting 
plans by the town's mayor to renovate it into luxury apartments.

Frantz Klintsevich, a lawmaker from 
the ruling United Russia party, is aiming to collect £1.8m from 
supporters to buy the house in the Austrian town of Braunau-am-Inn.

He said: ‘I would buy this property 
in the blink of an eye if I had that kind of money myself, but I do not.
 If I were to receive financial help, I would buy the house and destroy 
it demonstratively.’

Plans: Developers want to turn the former Gasthaus zum Pommer  where Hitler was born (pictured) into apartments while Russian MP Frantz Klintsevich wants to buy the house to destroy it

Die-hard Communists, who still 
remember the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the 'Great Patriotic
 War' against Hitler, are in favour of his plan. 

Vadim Solovyov, a member of the 
Communist Party's State Duma fraction, said: ‘Everything that is 
connected to fascism should be wiped off the face of the earth. 

‘No one should even know that place ever existed.

Austria's interior ministry has 
rented the house since 1972 from the owner - a woman in her 60s who 
refuses to be identified publicly - and has been careful to sublet only 
to tenants with no history of admiring Hitler.

As it was: Pictured in 1966, the building had been, variously, a girl's school and a public library, after World War II. Most recently it has been used as a centre for disabled people

'Destroy it demonstratively': Russian MP Frantz Klintsevich said he would buy this property 'in the blink of an eye' if he had the money

Town mayor Hannes Waidbacher opposes a
 Holocaust museum at the site and believes that turning over the former 
Gasthaus zum Pommer to become family homes would be one way of 
‘de-stigmatising’ Braunau.

If the plan - approved by the mayor 
and proposed by a local building consortium - was accepted it would mean
 the room where Hitler was born would become a bedroom in self-contained
 apartments with state-of-the-art kitchens and bathrooms that would go 
on the market for an estimated £400,000 each.

Such a plan, say experts, would 
require vigorous vetting of prospective buyers to ensure that a single 
flat, indeed the entire property, did not fall into the hands of 
neo-Nazis masking their real identities and purpose behind a shell 
company or individuals.

The little Austrian town separated 
from Germany by a short bridge over the River Inn, is still visited by 
hordes of far-right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the 
site where the future Fuehrer was born on April 20 1889.

Up until a year ago it was the ironic
 setting for a workshop for the mentally and physically handicapped; the
 sort of people Hitler deemed as ‘useless eaters’ and the first to die 
in the Third Reich's secret euthanasia campaign before WWII.

Past: Mayor Hannes Waidbacher supports the plan for apartments that would go on the market for an estimated £400,000 each - saying it would help 'de-stigmatise' the town

But it has been empty for a year now 
with the state picking up the bill for the lease and a debate raging 
about what to do with the two-storey listed building.

Mayor Waidbacher said: ‘Braunau has 
done much to process its history over the years. It is not necessary to 
build a Holocaust museum in the house as some have suggested. 

‘Braunau as a town is already 
stigmatised enough. Hitler spent only three years of his life here, and 
they were certainly not the most formative years of his life.

‘Why should I or others take responsibility for him? I was born 21 years after the end of the war.’

The mayor said he was open to all suggestions, saying Braunau wants an ‘affordable solution for all. I can imagine all possibilities for 
the house’.

But he is against turning it into a 'House of Peace' or a 
'House of Responsibility' as Green Party members have advocated, 
believing the town has done enough atoning over the years for its most 
infamous son.

Nationality: Hitler's birthplace is just a short distance from the German border. The Nazi leader returned to annex and occupy his homeland during the 'Anschluss' in 1938

Marker: A memorial stone (pictured) was placed outside the building in 1989 as a reminder of its history. In English the inscription reads 'For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Remind [us]'

It was in a room on the first floor 
of the three-storey, 2,000 square foot house at Salzburger Vorstadt 15 
that Hitler’s mother Klara gave birth to her infamous son.

She and her husband Alois, a stern 
local customs official, rented a suite of rooms above the pub and 
continued to live in it until 1892 when they moved to Linz.

Alois, a drunkard, often availed 
himself often of the beer on sale in the saloon downstairs before 
returning to the family home to abuse his timid wife, 24 years his 
junior.

The house is still owned by the 
family after which the pub took its name. Owner Gelinde Pommer says she 
wants to sell because she no longer wants to have the responsibility for
 it.

Nothing remains inside the building to indicate its link with Hitler, not even the bedroom where he was born.

Pay homage: The little Austrian town of Braunau is separated from Germany by a short bridge over the River Inn, is still visited by hordes of far-right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future Fuehrer was born on April 20 1889

The only Nazi-era relic is on an iron
 gate outside, the initials MB for Hitler’s party secretary Martin 
Bormann, who had them placed there when he declared the house a national
 monument after Hitler took over Austria in 1938. During the 12-year 
lifespan of the Third Reich it was a must-see place of pilgrimage for 
loyal Nazis.

Bormann bought the house with Nazi funds and made it a cultural centre which displayed Nazi-approved art.

It was given back to the Pommer 
family in 1952 and served as the town’s public library until 1965 before
 becoming, in turns, a school, a bank, a technical institute and finally
 the home and workshop for disabled people.

Those who want it turned into a site 
of remembrance for Hitler's crimes are pressing central government in 
Vienna to compulsorily purchase the property.
