These pictures show a group of rare ospreys who waste no time catching a fishy dinner before they fly south for the winter.

The two young birds were being taught to fish by their parents at a small loch in Aviemore in the Scottish Highlands.

They were captured as they took it in turns to dive into the water with their wings back before snaring a rainbow trout from under the surface with their sharp claws.

Two younger birds were being taught by their parents how to dive and swoop for their meal - and they were lucky enough to catch a rainbow trout with their sharp claws

Wildlife enthusiast Ron McCombe, 59, from Coldstream in Scotland, was lucky to capture the scenes on camera.

He said: ‘I spent three mornings in a hide near the loch and the ospreys were amazing to watch as they swooped into the water from a really high height.

‘The birds are feeding up to maintain their weight for migration. I was lucky as I had a great view of feeding time from my hide.

‘It’s not the easiest photography, when an osprey dives for a fish the whole dive lasts just a few seconds and a steady hand and even steadier nerves are required to get the images of the birds fishing.’

Ospreys are busy feeding up on fish – the only food they consume - before beginning their long migration to West Africa for the winter.

Hovering over the water in search of fish, adults are successful around one in four dives, whilst juveniles take longer to catch their prey.

Ospreys became extinct in England in 1840 and died out in Scotland in 1916.

But a pair of birds, thought to have come from Scandinavia, started breeding naturally at the RSPB reserve in Loch Garten in 1959 and today there are 200 pairs in Scotland.

The birds, also known as fish hawks, are now one of Aviemore’s biggest attractions and large numbers of tourists visit each year hoping to see them.

Since 2001 ospreys, which are nearly two feet tall and have a six feet wingspan, have also been bred at two sites in England - Rutland Water in the Midlands and in the Lake District.

The two feet tall birds look for fish by hovering over the water. Adults are successful around one in four dives, whilst juveniles take longer to catch their prey
