Selfie-loving councillor Karen Danczuk has offered herself up for a Valentine's night out - and bidding has already topped £10,000. 

The 31-year-old councillor, who is married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, has promised to go on a date with 'one lucky person' to raise money for charity.

Just minutes after she launched the online auction, bids started flooding in, with someone already promising to pay £10,300 for the privilege.

The 31-year-old councillor, who is married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, has promised to go on a date with 'one lucky person' in aid of two charities, Key 103 Cash for Kids in Manchester and the Rochdale RSPCA

Mrs Danczuk, who shot to fame after posting a series of racy selfies online, also told MailOnline that Manchester restaurant Tertutti has now agreed to host the date for her and her winner.

Her husband, who now faces spending Valentine's night on his own, has also launched his own mini campaign, asking his Twitter followers to find him a date for the same night.

She told MailOnline: 'I had had so many offers from people asking to take me out on a date for Valentine's, so I just thought I might as well make something out of it and raise money for charity. I do a lot for charity anyway. 

'There were two people who bid £10,000 so I had to tell them that one had to go higher. It then went to £10,300.

'The cut off isn't until Friday at 12pm, so it could go higher, but I'm just a bit nervous the person won't pay now. Even if they don't, the next biggest offer was £2,000 which is still amazing for those two charities.'

She added: 'Simon thinks it's great, he knows it's for charity. He's even trying to get a date of his own now!'  

The mother-of-two made the announcement to her 37,000 Twitter followers yesterday, saying she was holding an online auction for Saturday's date.

Mrs Danczuk, who shot to fame after posting as series of racy selfies online, said that Manchester restaurant Tertutti has agreed to lay out a special meal for her and her lucky winner

She tweeted: 'Just realised its Valentines Day Saturday! Hmmmm should I offer one lucky person a night out for charity?? KD.' 

It prompted a deluge of responses from fans, with Bryn Smith posting: 'Yessss you should defo do this, I can feel a Twitter meltdown coming.'

Andy Hudson tweeted: 'Sounds like a great idea, and for a good cause as well.'

While Andy Futers said: 'Meee, but can I leave the wife at home and we can send a selfie of us to her.'  

Andrew Meaden posted: 'I'm starting with £200', while another anonymous user offered £2,000. 

Mrs Danczuk later added: 'Want to take me out for Valentines & raise money for charity? Email me your secret bid. Highest bidder wins! karendanczuk@hotmail.com KD.'

The mother-of-two (left) said her husband Simon (right), the MP for Rochdale, has now launched his own campaign to find a date for Saturday night

The MP tweeted his followers asking for 'offers, suggestions or ideas' in light of his wife's charity campaign

Presumably inundated with offers from men, she then tweeted: 'My Charity Valentines Dinner doesn't just have to be male, females are just as welcome! KD.'

The mother-of-two, who has represented the Kingsway ward on Rochdale council since 2011, announced last month that she was standing down as a councillor at the next election to pursue other opportunities.

She's already hired London-based agent Ginger Comms and is understood to be interested in pursuing TV work.

Mrs Danczuk also hit the headlines last year when she started selling signed pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay.

But the £10 pictures were criticised by many buyers for being poor quality.

In August, former Conservative MP Louise Mensch described her as 'Westminster's most embarrassing wife' and claimed she was cheapening politics for constantly posting pictures of her cleavage.

She later went on to ITV's Loose Women show to defend herself against the accusations, where panelist Janet Street-Porter said she was a poor model for young girls in Rochdale.

The date is raising money for Key 103 Cash For Kids, based in Manchester, and Rochdale RSPCA.
