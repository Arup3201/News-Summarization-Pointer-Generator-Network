Inside the Maracana on Sunday July 13, a decade of planning and preparation was finally realised when Philipp Lahm lifted Germany’s fourth World Cup.

They were a tournament team, built to last the distance in Brazil under the astute guidance of their coach Joachim Low.

On Tuesday, in Roy Hodgson’s first major interview since England exited the World Cup with one point, he suggested we are on the same upward trajectory.

Here comes the killer quote, delivered by Hodgson at our national stadium, from Tuesday's interview on Sky Sports News HQ: ‘I don’t believe in the nonsense spoken about the identity of certain countries and how they play,’ claimed England’s head coach. ‘I don’t see a vast amount different between how we try and the way Germany try to play.'

To put that into context, during a friendly in England’s backyard last November, Toni Kroos had 125 touches of the ball and set up Per Mertesacker’s winning goal. Wayne Rooney, cast in the same role as Kroos that night, had just 42.

Until Hodgson, or someone else in his position for that matter, accepts that Germany are currently operating at an elite level we have no chance of catching them, let alone overtaking them.

‘Now there is a major difference between the 11 players in the German shirt and the 11 players in the England shirt,’ added Hodgson.

‘But if we are talking about how they attack and build up their attacks. Or how they keep possession and seek for openings when they have got the ball, I don’ t see a vast amount of difference in philosophy or style. And the same defensively. Random things that happen in the game make all the difference. I could give you six or seven examples from the World Cup that made winners into losers.’

England were losers, beaten by Italy in their opening group game in Manaus and swatted aside by the brilliance of Luis Suarez when they played Uruguay in Sao Paulo.

Let us not forget that this England team were out of the World Cup before 12 teams had even played their second game. They left with one point, as did Japan, Iran, Ghana and South Korea. Hodgson didn’t offer to resign after being backed by FA chairman Greg Dyke. The football’s broke, but we are not prepared to do anything to fix it.

‘I would quite happily relinquish this job when my employers don’t want me here any more and the players don’t have the respect necessary and they don’t want to continue to play for me,’ added Hodgson.

‘In that moment, if it is time for me to walk away I will do so. But this time it was made clear to me that that wasn’t the situation, that the FA wanted me to continue in the job and the feedback within the team was the same.

‘You walk away when you can’t stand the pressure, or you don’t feel you are good enough to do the job and in that situation I can safely and strongly say that I never felt that at all.

‘As a result we have to look forward to 2016 and make certain that we don’t allow it to happen again and hope we don’t have the same lack of fortune.’

England play a friendly against Norway at Wembley on September 3 before the Euro 2016 qualifier, against Switzerland in Bern, five days later. There will have to be some restructuring of the team, in part due to captain Steven Gerrard’s retirement from international duty.

‘It wasn’t easy for him to turn his back on England because he so much enjoyed playing for England and he’s done such a good job for us,’ added Hodgson. ‘I went through all the possible discussion points that you could have and I made my points of why I wanted him to stay on and he promised to give it a thought.’

Another captain, likely to be Wayne Rooney, will be chosen next month as Hodgson attempts to repair some of the damage from England’s disastrous World Cup.

‘We don’t need to compare ourselves to other European countries, let’s just stay as England,’ he said. ‘I have got a big job to choose that captain. I have half-chosen him. The person who is captain for the Norway game will be the person I will be designating to hopefully be the captain in 2016.

‘We have a lot of rebuilding to do, not only of our team but also rebuilding all the faith that people showed us.’

Prices for England’s next game against Norway at Wembley are priced at £30,£40,£50 and £60. Family enclosure tickets are priced at £20 and £10 for U16's. There is a large family enclosure for this match and over half of the tickets sold will be under£30 if demand dictates. If you can get this in I’d be grateful.
