An Illinois father is calling for his daughter's suicide case to be reopened after she was discovered last year in her ex-boyfriend's apartment with a gunshot wound to the head.

Larry Young says his then 21-year-old daughter Molly did not commit suicide and that evidence obtained through a freedom of information act request reveals enough evidence to bring up charges against her ex-boyfriend Richie Minton.

But the Jackson County State's Attorney Mike Carr disagrees, announcing Monday that he would not be filing charges against Molly's ex-boyfriend due to insufficient evidence.

Mystery: Molly Young was discovered with a gun shot wound to the head at her boyfriends home the morning of March 24, 2012. Her death was initially ruled a suicide, but was overturned by a jury of coroners this past January

Unaffected: One of the more suspicious aspects of the case was her ex-boyfriend's stoic 911 call

Molly was discovered the morning of March 24, 2012 with a gunshot wound to her head.

The most suspicious aspect of the case is her ex-boyfriend's eerily calm 911 call.

Minton was also working at the time as a police dispatcher.

His roommate initially called 911 and said: 'We have a person in my living facility, who we believe to be dead.'

He
then hands the phone over to Minton who reported: 'I woke up and she 
was covered in blood. She overdosed, she bled out through her nose.' 

Though
Minton says he was sleeping when she overdosed, the official cause of 
death was a gunshot wound to the head - something that certainly would 
have woken Minton up.

'The
911 tape tells it all,' Larry Young told WSIL-TV. 'The guy's so calm on
the 911 tape you'd think he was ordering a pizza or something.'

Mr
Young also points out that the gun was Minton's  and his daughter was shot in the left side of the head, even though she's right handed. 

Molly was excited about her new job and had plans to go shopping the weekend she was discovered dead, Mr Young said.

Illinois State Police Lt Stan Diggs spoke with the Carbondale Times about some of the other troubling details of the case.

That morning, Lt Diggs said Carbondale Police were allowing Minton 'some latitudes' before State Police arrived on the scene.

When they arrived, Minton - the son of a longtime Franklin County Sheriff's deputy - already had his attorney present.

Police did not conduct a gunshot residue test on either Minton or his roommate's hands.

While Minton's roommate spent several hours speaking to the police, Minton was 'not being real accommodating with us' and initially refused to sit for an interview with investigators, Lt Diggs said.

Pursuit of the truth: Molly's father Larry Young will continue to investigate his daughter's death after a state's attorney refused to bring up charges against her ex-boyfriend Monday

The girl's death was originally ruled a suicide by a coroner, but a review by a 
jury of six coroners in January changed that ruling to 'undetermined' 
after deliberating for less than 30 minutes.

'It disgusts me that a young woman could lose her life like that and no one seems to care,' Mr Young told ABC News. 

But he's not letting the announcement Monday get him down. He takes Mr Carr's refusal to bring up charges as a challenge to continue investigating his daughter's death to find more evidence to bring to the state's attorney.

Justice for Molly: Molly's father is campaigning heavily to have her case reviewed, and hopefully bring up charges against Minton
