As the Oscar winners continue to bask in post-awards glory, let's take a moment to remember the losers - and in particular, Best Actor nominee Michael Keaton.

While an ecstatic Eddie Redmayne bounded on stage on Sunday to collect his golden statue, Keaton was spotted surreptitiously sliding a white note card back into the breast pocket of his tux - presumably his acceptance speech. 

Keaton, 63, had been nominated for his critically-acclaimed performance in Birdman where he plays a washed-up movie star trying to revive his career by staging a Broadway play.

The dream is over: Keaton, 63, was then seen on camera slipping the card inside the breast pocket of his tux as Eddie Redmayne's name was read out as the winner

Redmayne, 33, won for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything.

The British actor beat stiff competition from Keaton along with Steve Carell in Foxcatcher, Bradley Cooper in American Sniper and Benedict Cumberbatch for his role in The Imitation Game.

However it wasn't an entirely disappointing night for Keaton as Birdman took home Best Picture

As he took the stage with the rest of the cast and crew, Keaton said: 'This has been a tremendous experience.

'These guys are as bold as bold could be, it was just a tremendous honor for me – look, it's great to be here who am I kidding, this is just great fun, thank you very much.' 

Keaton has also previously won a Golden Globe and the Critics' Choice Award for his work in ‎the Alejandro González Iñárritu film.

Birdman, which also stars Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Edward Norton, was one of the big winners of the night, also taking home the awards for Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Original Screenplay.
