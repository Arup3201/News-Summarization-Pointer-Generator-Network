Margaret Thatcher foresaw her downfall at the hands of the 'men in grey suits' as early as 1983, newly-released files reveal.

Despite having won the most decisive election victory since Labour's landslide in 1945, the Prime Minister correctly predicted that her party would eventually turn against her.

But she was premature and believed the Conservatives would not allow her to take them into the 1987 election, which she also won.

Instead, the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century was forced out and replaced by John Major in 1990 after her colleagues turned on her.

Her trusted private secretary, John Coles, composed a private memoir of his time at Number 10 which is published today by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust.

In one entry, he writes: 'I recall my surprise when she said to me, just two or three days after the Conservative victory of June 1983: 'I have not long to go.'

'For someone who had just won a majority of 140 seats this was a remarkable statement. When I queried it, she said: 'My party won't want me to lead them into the next election - and I don't blame them.'

'A graphic example of her detachment from conventional political wisdom and her sense of future political developments.'

She was forced to stand down as prime minister after her Cabinet refused to back her in a second round of leadership elections.

She said at the time that pressure from colleagues had forced her to conclude that party unity and the prospect of victory in the next general election would be better served if she stepped down.

She later described her departure from Downing Street at the hands of the 'grey men' as `treachery with a smile on its face'.

The Prime Minister had confidently celebrated the tenth anniversary of her premiership in May 1989 having earlier vowed to go 'on and on.'

But that autumn, she faced the first challenge to her leadership from back-bench MP Sir Anthony Meyer acting as a stalking horse. He won 33 votes, while another 24 MPs spoilt their ballot papers.

She was the longest serving British prime minister of the 20th century but Margaret Thatcher feared her career may be over as early as 1983.

 Her private secretary, John Coles, composed a private memoir covering his time at Number 10 between December 1981 and June 1984.

He has now allowed this to be published by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust.

In one entry, he writes: 'I recall my surprise when she said to me, just two or three days after the Conservative victory of June 1983, 'I have not long to go'.

'For someone who had just won a majority of 140 seats this was a remarkable statement.

'When I queried it, she said 'My party won't want me to lead them into the next election - and I don't blame them'.

'A graphic example of her detachment from conventional political wisdom and her sense of future political developments.'

Mrs Thatcher served as prime minister from 1979 to 1990.

The following year, with anger over the poll tax leading to riots and her party split over her refusal to allow the pound to be dragged into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, her premiership was rocked when her Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe quit and gave an electrifying resignation speech to the Commons.

It prompted her long term rival, Michael Heseltine, to stand against her in the first genuine test of her leadership.

She secured 204 votes in the first ballot on November 20, compared with 152 for Mr Heseltine.

But 16 abstentions meant it was four votes short of the necessary 15 per cent victory margin, and so a second ballet was required.

Mrs Thatcher, who had been so confident of winning that she was in France for a summit meeting, emerged from the British Embassy in Paris almost immediately to confirm that she'd contest a second ballot, insisting: `I fight on. I fight to win.'

But as she returned to London it was clear that Tory MPs were deserting the Prime Minister.

As she met her Cabinet one by one that evening, she suffered what she later called `treachery with a smile on its face'.

They persuaded her that she would almost certainly lose to Mr Heseltine if she fought on.

She quit, allowing Douglas Hurd and John Major to join the contest.

Mr Major was two votes short of the necessary 187 needed for an outright majority, but his opponents withdrew.

The following day, November 28, 1990, Mrs Thatcher left Downing Street for the last time as Prime Minister.

Standing with her husband Denis, she declared: 'we're happy to leave the UK in a very much better state than when we came here'.

The Iron Lady then wept as she was driven to Buckingham Palace to formally tender her resignation to the Queen.
