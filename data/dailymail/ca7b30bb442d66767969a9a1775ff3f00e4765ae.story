Neighbours from hell: Eugene Bird (above) and his sons Sean and Michael subjected those that lived near them to a six-year campaign of terror

Three neighbours from hell who subjected those living close by to a six-year-long campaign of terror have finally been evicted – but even now many who knew them are too scared to speak out.

Eugene Bird, 54, and his two sons Sean, 21, and Michael, 19, vandalised homes, threatened neighbours, wielded swords and knives and stoned firefighters as they tackled a nearby inferno.

The lengthy list of the family’s crimes includes stealing lead from the roofs of adjoining properties.

Now the 
three men - who moved to Ithon Grove in Kings Norton, Birmingham in 2008
 - have had their council house repossessed and received two-year 
anti-social behaviour injunctions.

Under
 the orders, the family can only enter the estate to visit relatives 
and, if they breach it, can be arrested and hauled before the courts.

Despite
 these injunctions - which mean the trio cannot enter the estate other 
than to visit relatives - most neighbours are too terrified to talk 
about the family for fear of repercussions.

One 
resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They’re always riding 
motorbikes around the grove where the kids are playing.

‘I’ve shouted at them and their dad to get them to stop, but they just laugh, and they only stop when they get bored.

‘They
 live on an alley which backs on to my garden, and they keep us up every
 night when they’ve got people round and they’re making a right racket.

‘In the last few months their behaviour had improved - but that’s only because they had been threatened with eviction.’

Anti-social: One resident said that the sons, Sean (left) and Michael (right), would often ride motorcycles near where children would play

Sinister: Sean Bird posted pictures of himself on Facebook wielding fearsome weaponry and wearing a mask

The
 problem family had been given support to help them clean up their act 
but continued to ignore warnings from Birmingham City Council’s Housing 
Team and West Midlands Police.

Another scared neighbour explained: ‘The council calling it a campaign of terror is a massive understatement.’

Officers 
from the council’s housing team worked in conjunction with the police to
 gather a damning portfolio of evidence and successfully secure the 
injunctions after local people spoke out.

The family were offered support to help them change their ways but chose to ignore the warnings.

After
 the injunctions were handed out, Rob James, from the council, said: 
‘These injunctions demonstrate strong support from the courts in 
protecting our communities from this sort of behaviour.‘Despite
 previous warnings and attempts to engage with this family the 
anti-social behaviour and criminal activity continued so we had no 
alternative but to take legal action.’

Inspector
 Vanessa Eyles, responsible for policing in the area, said: ‘This is an 
excellent example of the importance of partnership work.

Neighbours said that the Birds' behaviour had improved recently - but perhaps because the threat of eviction was hanging over them

Desperate measure: The family have had this house in Kings Norton, Birmingham, repossessed

Ban: The trio cannot enter the estate other than to visit relatives

The Bird family made life a misery for the residents of Ithon Grove

‘It highlights to the community that everyone should have the right to enjoy their neighbourhood without fear of harassment and if there is a particular family causing intimidation and disruption we will take action to ensure this is resolved.

‘This can take time and does rely on public support and people speaking out but these Injunctions send a clear message to offenders that the local community, police and the council will not stand for anti-social behaviour.’

The injunctions and eviction come during a blitz on anti-social behaviour across the area codenamed operation PACT.
