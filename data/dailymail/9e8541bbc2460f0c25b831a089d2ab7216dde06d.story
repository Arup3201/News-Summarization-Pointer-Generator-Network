Armed police were called to a schoolbus today after reports that a pupil was brandishing a gun on board.

Officers wearing flak jackets boarded the vehicle in Carmarthen, south-west Wales, after receiving a 999 call claiming that students were passing the weapon around on their way to school.

Police eventually removed a BB gun from the bus and took three teenagers into custody for questioning.
