Deet, the widely used insect repellent, is becoming less effective at repelling mosquitoes, according to new research.

A landmark study has found that while mosquitoes are initially repelled by the substance, they ignore it if they are later exposed to it again.  

The study tested the response to Deet on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are notorious for biting during the day and are capable of transmitting dengue fever and yellow fever viruses.

Previous research had demonstrated how some mosquitoes were genetically immune to the substance, but the new research has shown that even those that would usually be deterred developed a resistance.

Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine say that results underline how more research is needed to find alternatives to the chemical.

Dr James Logan, who led the research, said: 'The more we understand 
about how repellents work and how mosquitoes detect them, the better we 
can work out ways to get around the problem when they do become 
resistant to repellents.'

Deet - or N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide - is
one of the most widely used active ingredients in insect repellents. It
was developed by the US military, following its use in jungle 
warfare during World War II.

While mosquitoes were initially repelled by the substance, they ignored it when exposed again

It is also considered the most effective repellant against mosquitoes.

Until recently it was not clear how the chemical worked, but recent research suggests that insects simply do not like the smell.

The new study involved providing the mosquitoes with an arm treated with Deet.

As expected, they were initially put off by the substance, but surprisingly, several hours later not all the mosquitoes were deterred by the repellant.

To better understand why this might be happening, researchers attached electrodes to the insects' antenna.

They found that the receptors at the end of the antenna were no longer  as sensitive to the chemical, although why is not fully understood.

Dr Logan said it was vital to understand both these permanent genetic and temporary olfactory changes that were taking place adding that mosquitoes are very good at evolving 'very, very quickly'.

He stressed that the findings should not stop people from using Deet in high risk areas.

Dr Logan now plans to find out how long the effect lasts after the initial exposure to the chemical.

The team would also like to study the effect in other mosquitoes, including the species that transmit malaria.
