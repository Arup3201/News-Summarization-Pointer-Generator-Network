Dangerous jump: Anna Beninati, 17, a freshman at Colorado State University, severed her legs while trying to hop a train back to Fort Collins

The tape of the 911 call which captures the chaotic moments after a 17-year-old college student severed her legs at the knees while attempting to jump aboard a moving train was released today.

In the recording a female paramedic, who had been driving past the scene before stopping and calling for help, can be heard screaming repeatedly: 'Do not move her!'

Anna Beninati, a Colorado State University freshman majoring in music, was 'train hopping' with three males between the ages of 17 and 21 when she slipped and fell beneath the steel wheels of a freight train in Longmont, just north of Denver.

The northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe train severed one of Miss Beninati's legs mid-thigh and the other just below the knee, at around 1:35pm on Monday.

The train, which was hauling 118 empty coal cars, was travelling about 10mph, police said.

In the 911 tape, the emergency caller, who identified herself as an EMT, can be heard saying: 'Oh my God.'

She tells the dispatcher: 'I am on Third
Avenue at the railroad tracks. Somebody just tried to jump on the train
and severed her legs.'

'Do not move her! Don't move her!' she shouts at five people trying to help.

'There were four individuals trying to jump onto the train,' she says. 'One succeeded, the other fell and she severed her legs. Holy s***.'

Tragic: The 17-year-old girl slipped on the northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe train around 1:35pm

The dispatcher tells the caller not to tourniquet the girl's wounds and that an ambulance is on its way.

'Don't sit her up, you guys!' the EMT tells others. 'They are trying to sit her up.'

'Lay your head back, honey,' she tells the Miss Beninati.

A second paramedic, who works with 
the first paramedic at Longmont United Hospital, arrives to help, 
putting on surgical gloves and applying femoral pressure with a t-shirt to stem the bleeding.

'She is very, very, very pale,' the first EMT says. 'She is alert. She is talking. Now she is crying.'

The dispatcher asks: 'What part of her leg was amputated? At the ankle? At the knee?'

She replies: 'Left side is amputated right below the hip.'

Miss Beninati hears this and begins to sob uncontrollably.

'Oh, I am sorry, I am sorry,' the EMT tells her. 'I shouldn't have said that right in her ear. Dammit.'

Moving: Authorities said the 100-car train was travelling at 18mph when the incident occurred near the intersection of 3rd Avenue and Atwood Street

'The other one, right leg, it looks like (it's severed) right below the knee,' she tells the dispatcher.

The dispatcher then tries to get the 
EMT to collect the severed legs but as they are under the train and it 
is still moving they decide it is too dangerous.

Instead the EMTs are instructed to continue to add pressure to wound to stop the bleeding.

The nurse who made the 911 call was too traumatised about what happened to talk publicly, 7NEWS reported.

However, the other EMT, Kathy Poiry, 
told the station that she was just focused on keeping pressure on the 
girl's legs. She said she knew that if more blood was lost, the girl 
would die.

Miss Beninati was 
transported to Longmont United Hospital and then airlifted to Denver 
Health Medical Center, where her legs where amputated.

Her parents yesterday released a statement which thanked bystanders who went to aid their daughter at the scene.

Longmont police say Miss Beninati was
trying to hop the train to get back to Fort Collins after she and three
male friends had travelled to Denver, 30miles south.

A 21-year-old Broomfield man and a 
17-year-old Fort Collins boy successfully got on the train before the 
girl tried and fell beneath the wheels, police said yesterday.

The 17-year-old boy jumped from the train, scraping his arm.

Another friend, Charlie Hamilton, 25, of Gillette, Wyoming, helped pull Miss Beninati out from under train, police said.

Mr Hamilton and the Fort Collins boy 
were cited for trespassing, police say. The Broomfield man left the 
scene and police have not been able to locate him.

Police say they do not suspect alcohol or drug use in the accident.

Miss Beninati had recently graduated from Alta High School in Sandy, Utah.

'She was really involved in art and music,' former Alta classmate Mitch Dom told ABC4.

Mr
Dom told the station that Miss Beninati was very artistic and went by 
the nickname 'Rush' because she said she always finished projects in a 
hurry.

Online commentators were unsurprised by the attempt to hop on board a moving train.

'Allen E' said on the Denver Post forum: 'When I was an undergraduate @ CSU we would hitch hike between Fort Collins and Boulder on Friday to spend the weekend at Tulagi's.

'Cheap pitchers, good music. Free ride down, and free ride back.

'I have to think the kids were returning to Fort Collins the undergraduate way - free.

'To the young woman who suffered the loss, our prayers and thoughts are with you.

'No condemnation from me.

'I might have done the same thing if I knew the trains were headed for Boulder in those days.'

Longmont police commander Jeff Satur said the incident was a 'terrible' example of the danger of trying to hop a train.

He said: 'It's terrible.

'It really highlights the dangers of trying to hop a train. It is not safe by any means.'

A police investigation is ongoing.
