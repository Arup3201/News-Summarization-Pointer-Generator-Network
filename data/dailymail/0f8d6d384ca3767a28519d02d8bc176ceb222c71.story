Crackdown: David Cameron has pledged to turn around the lives of 120,000 problem families by 2015

David Cameron clashed with Radio 4's Today show after his membership of Oxford University's hell-raising Bullington Club was likened to last month's riots

The Prime Minister was asked if there were similarities between being a member of a 'youthful gang that engages in violent behaviour' and looters.

He said: 'I think we all do stupid things when we are young and we should learn the lessons.'

Mr Cameron attacked  the 
BBC for 'making excuses' for rioters as presenter Evan Davis repeatedly questioned him about the drunken antics of the Bullington Club.

He asked Mr Cameron: 'Did you witness stuff as a member of that club...people throwing things through windows, smashing up restaurants'?

An increasingly irritated PM said: 'No I didn't. But what we saw during the riots was very well organised in many cases looting, stealing and thieving.

'There is a danger that when you listen to the BBC that all these things turn into a great mush and make an excuse for not acting.

'Some people almost say that 
until we deal with the problem of inequality in our society, there is 
nothing you can do to deal with rioting.

‘That’s what it can slip into, Evan, if you are not careful.’

Mr Cameron believes the riots have underlined the need for tough measures to end the culture of welfare dependency, shake up schools and ensure people understand that they have responsibilities as well as rights.

In yesterday’s interview, as Mr Davis suggested the riots might be linked to bank bonuses and the MPs’ expenses scandal, the Prime Minister insisted people had not raided shops because of anger over such issues.

He said problem youngsters needed ‘tough love’, adding: ‘You need both elements of it.

‘For some of these children there 
probably was a shortage of love. But you do need, when they cross the 
line and break the law, to be very tough.’

The Prime Minister will next week stress
the importance of education in starting to end Britain’s social 
malaise, promising to improve school discipline and standards by ending 
the state monopoly on education and opening ‘free schools’ run by 
businesses, charities and parents.

Sources close to No10 were reported 
to be furious with the programme's line of questioning claiming Mr Davis
had 'overstepped the mark.'

But a BBC spokesman told the Times: 
'We sought to reflect a range of views as to the reasons behind the 
riots. We are confident we did this in an impartial and balanced 
manner.'

■ The 17-year old daughter of an NHS 
doctor and a part-time nurse was locked up for eight months yesterday 
for stealing during rioting in Peckham, South London.

The churchgoing youngster, who cannot
be named for legal reasons, stole a bottle of Lucozade, sweets, four 
T-shirts and a pair of sunglasses.

She had just completed a health and 
social care course. Her parents refused to comment.
