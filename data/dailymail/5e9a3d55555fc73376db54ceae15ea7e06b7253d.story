A quick thinking schoolboy has been hailed a hero after rescuing a little girl from a runaway car rolling toward a busy main road.

Seamus Buckley, 14, leapt into action when he saw the driverless car on a collision course with a four-year-old girl fastened in a safety seat.

Seamus managed to free the terrified girl, jump in the car and pull the handbrake on before the car reached the main road junction in Dalton, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire yesterday.

Quick thinking hero: Seamus Buckley, 14, leapt into action to save a four-year-old girl trapped in a driverless car rolling toward a busy intersection

The girl’s mother had left the car momentarily to dash into a pharmacy to collect a prescription when the drama unfolded. 

Seamus had been playing football at Dalton Youth Centre when he noticed the girl screaming and banging frantically on the car window.

The teenager from East Herringthorpe said: 'I’d been playing football with my mates. I was walking round to the front doors when I heard this screaming and saw the girl banging on the car window.

‘I tried to stop the car with my hands at first but couldn’t so I opened the door and told her to undo her seatbelt.

‘Then I carried her to the kerb, ran back and got in the car to put the handbrake on. 

‘I didn’t really think about what I was doing as it was happening. I think it’s something anyone would have done.’

Proud father Adrian Buckley, 42, said: ‘It’s just his natural reaction - that’s him. 

‘He’s easy going and doesn’t make a big deal out of things.

‘He just saw the girl screaming and banging on the windows and says he did what anyone would have done.’

Youth centre leader Shaz Maxwell said the girl’s mother never leaves her daughter alone.

She said: ‘The mum had just popped in to pick up a prescription and said she never normally leaves the child on her own.

‘We don’t know if she left the brake off or if the child managed to take it off. 

‘The mum was so upset but she did come back later and gave him a hug and say thanks again.’

Ms Maxwell had also heard the girl’s screams but Seamus was the first to reach the girl.

She said: ‘I heard the scream and went running but Seamus had got there already.

‘It was his quick thinking that saved the young girl because if the car had veered any further it’s a blind bend and it would have been hit by something coming round the corner.

‘Normally we keep the (youth centre) doors open. It’s lucky that we didn’t this time because Seamus was heading round the corner to get a drink when he noticed the car.’
