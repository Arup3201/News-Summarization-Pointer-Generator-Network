Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa denied Brazil victory with a performance that hasn't been seen by the host nation since Gordan Banks' famous save against Pele.

Ochoa pulled off a succession of physics-defying stops as Mexico held out for a 0-0 draw against the tournament favourites in Fortaleza, leaving both teams level on four points in Group A.

The Mexico No 1's most memorable stop resembled Banks' save during the group stages of the 1970 World Cup... and came against the heir to Pele's throne, Neymar.

How did he do that? Neymar can't believe his shot didn't go in as Brazil are held to a 0-0 draw with Mexico

The young Brazilian thought he had scored after directing a bullet header towards the bottom left corner only for Ochoa to prevent him with an incredible reflex save.

Ochoa followed that with a close range block against Tottenham midfielder Paulinho before denying Neymar for a second time after getting down to a low drilled effort at his near post.

The 28-year-old maintained his concentration to keep out Thiago Silva's header in the dying minutes to keep Mexico on course to qualify for the knockout stages.

Surprisingly, Ochoa is currently available as a free agent after parting ways with French side Ajaccio following their relegation from Ligue 1.

Any more performances like this at the World Cup and there is likley to be a queue of suitors from the Premier League and beyond chasing his signature.
