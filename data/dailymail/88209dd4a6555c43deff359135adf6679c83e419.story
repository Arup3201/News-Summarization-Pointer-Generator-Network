A professional dancer who had part of her leg amputated after being injured in the Boston bombings  vowed to do 'whatever it takes' to dance again in an appearance on Dancing With The Stars last night.

Adrianne Haslet, 32, is recovering from the attack in a Boston hospital and appeared in a three-minute segment on the primetime dance competition with an update on her progress.

She said: 'It's the longest I've gone without dancing for as long as I remembered.

'I was in a very dark place.'

During a montage, viewers saw Haslet taking steps down a hospital corridor with the help of a frame, doing ballet stretches on the floor of a studio, and sitting in her wheelchair in a dance hold with a male partner.

But the ballroom dancer said: 'I absolutely will dance again' and plans to accept the show's offer of a place in the competition once she is used to life with a prostethic lower limb.

'When I heard from Dancing With the Stars I was incredibly nervous, excited, happy,' she said.

'I just couldn’t believe it.'

In the segment, Haslet recalled the day of the bombing.

'It was a beautiful Boston day,' she said.

'All of a sudden the bomb went off maybe four feet from where we were standing.

'We landed on the ground and I thought I think I'm going to be okay, I'm not in any pain and then I tried to move my leg and I couldn't.

'I remember the smell and I remember the smoke thinking I was going to die.'

Her mother said: 'Adrianne came out of surgery and I had to tell her her foot was no longer there, knowing that it would be very painful for her because of dance.'

DWTS host Tom Bergeron said: 'Adrianne Haslet is the ballroom dancer whose amazingly positive outlook is a testament to the power of the human spirit.'

Mrs Haslet messaged a friend saying 'OHMUGOD!!!!!!!!! I loooove Derek!!!!!!' when she learned that DWTS favourite Derek Hough wants to dance with her.

Hough told the Boston Herald: 'It’s 
hard for anyone to really quite understand what she must be going 
through and what she’s going to go through with rehab and getting her 
balance back.'

Haslet hopes to receive her prosthetic within two months

'But if she 
has the determination and she has the passion — and it sounds like she 
does — she’s going to run that marathon and she’s going to be dancing 
again. It’s not going to slow her down.'

Adrianne 
Haslet has become the face of a host of amputees who are struggling to recover from the Boston bombings.

Beth Roche wakes up knowing she can’t feel sorry for herself, that she has to focus on rehabbing her ravaged left leg.

Haslet takes her first tentative steps towards recovery. The professional ballroom dancer is said to be a fan of DWTS and counts Derek Hough as her favourite professional performer

But despite life-changing injuries, 
both women have vowed that the Boston Marathon bombings that killed 
three people and left them among the ranks of more than 260 injured will
not define their lives.

Parts of them may be broken, but both patients at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital said in separate interviews last week that their spirits are intact and their thoughts are positive.

'I absolutely want to dance again and I also want to run the marathon next year,' said Haslet.

'I will crawl across the finish line, literally crawl, if it means I finish it.'

Roche, a 59-year-old medical office manager from Highland, Ind., who ran Chicago’s marathon last year, said she’s concentrating on more than just walking again.

'I want to do another marathon by the time I’m 65,' she said.

Roche said the first bomb at the 
marathon peeled her leg open 'like a sardine can.'

It happened right 
after she saw her daughter, Rebecca Roche, a 33-year-old Boston 
pharmacist, cross the race’s finish line.

The mother has had one surgery in which doctors implanted pins and plates in her leg, and has another surgery in her future.

The
first blast left bones poking out of her leg, and made her unable to 
run for cover.

She said a first responder tried to shield her as the 
second bomb exploded.

Roche 
ended up at Tufts Medical Center, and begged staffers before she went 
into surgery to find her family and let them know she was alive.

The blast from the second explosion knocked Haslet off her feet from about four feet away.

The
Boston woman, an Arthur Murray Dance Studio employee, thought she was 
going to die when she looked down and saw how her body had been 
mutilated.

She had one surgery to amputate her left foot, and another in which doctors amputated more of the same leg below her knee.

In the hours before terror struck 
Boylston Street, Haslet was basking in the joy of having her husband 
home again.

Two weeks earlier, the Air Force captain had returned from a
four-month deployment in Afghanistan.

On
Patriots’ Day morning, they were walking near the marathon’s finish 
line when the second explosion left them tangled in a heap on the ground
and Haslet saw something was wrong with her foot.

'I remember thinking, "That’s so gross," and being terrified that this is the moment I was going to die,' she said.

Haslet
crawled toward a restaurant door, before someone dragged her toward a 
staircase.

Her husband, although also injured, took off his belt to make
a tourniquet for her.

Then others arrived to help and soon she was in a
triage area where someone wrote a number on her forehead.

'I just prayed that I had a number that was high enough to get help,' she said.

'I just kept screaming out, "I’m a ballroom dancer! I’m a ballroom dancer! Just save my foot"'

The next day, she woke up at Boston Medical Center and saw her mother.

'I told my mom "My foot feels like it’s asleep." And she said, "Adrianne, you don’t have a foot anymore.”'

Neither
Haslet nor Roche said they had thought much about the Russian-born 
brothers, one dead, one alive, whom authorities said are responsible for
the attack.

As she recovers, Haslet said she trusts law-enforcement officials will do what’s best.

She’s hoping to get a prosthetic device in the next two months.

Roche cannot bend her left leg, as a grid of metal rods that’s meant to help her heal protrudes into it.

She
said she isn’t sure if authorities should seek the death penalty for 
the remaining bombing suspect, but says everyone should move forward 
without fear.

'If we’re afraid, the enemy wins,' she said.
