Orson Welles' original working copy of the script for Citizen Kane has sold for almost £100,000.

The unique draft was used by the film's star and director to make changes to the dialogue, shaping it into arguably the world's greatest movie.

The front page carries the heading 'Mr Welles' Working Copy' along with the original title of the 1941 film 'The American'.

The script, dated 1940, is covered in Orson Welles' scrawls as he developed arguably the best film ever

The 1941 film about a newspaper magnate, Welles' first feature, was nominated for nine Academy Awards

Half-way through the 321-page script, the movie title on top of each sheet changes to 'Citizen Kane'.

Several pages show how Welles took a pencil to numerous lines and paragraphs of the script, completely deleting great chunks of text at times.

The document was owned by the late Stanley Seeger, a wealthy collector of important items.

It has now sold at auction in London for £98,500, nearly five times the pre-sale estimate.

The narrative structure of the masterpiece is thought to be its biggest influence on modern movies

Welles, who co-wrote, directed, produced and starred in the film, tweaked the dialogue for months

David Macdonald, a director at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'This document represents a pivotal moment in the making of arguably the greatest modern move made.

'This was Orson Welles' own working script, nothing like this has been seen before.

Citizen Kane is widely regarded as the best film ever made that changed the industry forever.

Though it was a commercial failure at the box office, it remains every filmmaker's number one.

Using his large budget of $500,000, 25-year-old theatre man Orson Welles developed new ways of using complex sound, deep focus and story structure.

It was one of the first films to use such dynamic camera angles and optical illusions to tell the story.

In many scenes, the ceilings were visible, which was a first for movies as it was previously too difficult to mask the microphones and lights. Welles ordered for them to be covered in black fabric.

The non-linear storyline, unconventional ending and elusive protagonist were the main features that shocked the industry into experimentation.

'You can see regularly through the script how he removed paragraphs, scored out lines and tweaked the dialogue as she shaped the movie.

'It throws up a rather romantic vision of him going into his study and taking a pencil to it.'

Many of the alterations relate to where the script made obvious references to the US newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, who the character Charles Kane was based on.

The most noticeble change was the actual title of the movie, as 'The American' was deemed too close to Hearst, who often attached the same term to his various enterprises.

Once the script was approved, crisp copies of the final version would have been printed off and handed to the cast and crew for filming.

Welles' working script is dated April 30 to May 9, 1940 - a year before the film came out.

It has a slight yellowing to it as well as evidence of it being 'well-thumbed'.

Mr Macdonald said eclectic collector Mr Seeger had owned it for more than 20 years before it was sold at auction last week.

Sold alongside it was an art-deco cocktail shaker owned and used by gangster Al Capone during prohibition in the US.

The silver flask was a gift to Capone from 'the boys' in 1932, shortly before he was jailed for 11 years for tax evasion.

The shaker sold at the same auction for £50,000, 50 times the pre-sale estimate.
