Resplendent in a sparkling black top and tailored trousers, Monaco's Princess Charlene looked every inch the yummy mummy as she ramped up the glamour for a cocktail party last week.

Joined by husband Prince Albert, 56, the new mother was making the most of a rare night away from her two-month-old twins, Jacques and Gabriella.

The event, which was held at the Monte-Carlo Casino, was the work of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation and was intended to raise funds for its Learn to Swim programme.

Charlene, a former Olympic swimmer, is passionate about water safety and, in 2014 alone, her Foundation taught 40,000 children how to take to the sea in safety.

And it seems her concerns are a family affair, with the Princess joined for the event by her brother Gareth as well as her husband.

He was at the event with Gavin Varejes, president of South Africa Rugby Legends, which has joined forces with the Princess Charlene Foundation to bring a group of underprivileged South African children to Monaco.

The group, who will arrive next month, will take part in the Saint Devote Rugby Tournament next month.

In the summer, a group of Monégasque children will travel in the opposite direction and take part in a tournament in the country of Princess Charlene's birth.

Speaking in a statement released after the event, the Princess Charlene Foundation said the exchange was part of an ongoing programme to promote sport in schools.

'The Sport and Education programme supports the belief that physical education is an important tool that contributes to the well-being of children,' read the statement.

'Sport plays a fundamental role in a child’s developmental process. It allows young people to learn about the importance of key values and life skills such as respect, cooperation, honesty, fair play, interaction, communication, competition, determination and adherence to rules.'

Last week's cocktail party is the third time Princess Charlene has appeared in public since the birth of her twin babies in December.

Her first appearance came on the 7th January, when, with her husband, she appeared on the balcony of the Palais Princier to present the two tiny babies to their adoring public.

At the end of January, Charlene joined her husband Prince Albert for the traditional St Devote service, which marks the death of a 4th Century martyr.

During that event, she helped husband Albert to set fire to a fishing boat - a tradition that's been going strong since the reign of Prince Louis II in 1942.
