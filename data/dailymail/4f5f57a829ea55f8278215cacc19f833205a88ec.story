Cristiano Ronaldo has leapt to the defence of Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale, after the Wales star was criticised by their supporters at the weekend.

Real fans slated Bale for failing to play in Ronaldo for an open goal in their 3-0 win at home to Espanyol on Saturday night.

However, speaking at the FIFA Ballon d'Or Gala on Monday Ronaldo, who was crowned as the world's best player for a second successive year; stressed that the Bernabeu faithful know that the marauding winger is a key component in their formidable side.

‘Madrid fans are always the same. They are very intense, they show what they feel, they’re not liars,'  said Ronaldo.

'But I think things with Gaz will be normal because they know that Gaz is a very important player for us, a key player.

The incident came in the second half of the La Liga clash at the Santiago Bernabeu when the 24-year-old raced down the right flank and failed to play in Ronaldo - who was charging through the centre.

The Portuguese star reacted furiously shouting 'puta' (f***) and some supporters inside the stadium jeered Bale for having shot wide and ignoring Ronaldo.

Having had time to reflect on that moment of the match, Ronaldo added that it should be left in the past and forgotten about.

‘What’s happened on Saturday is in the past. Sometimes I commit some mistakes too, so it’s part of the business, it is part of football so I think fans will be nice to him and they should be nice to him.

‘He’s a key player, very important for Real Madrid and we’re going to need him this year again.’

Ronaldo played an integral role for Real Madrid as they won four trophies during the previous calendar year, scoring a stunning 56 goals in 51 appearances as the Spanish giants collected the Copa del Rey, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup.

His feats saw him named a clear winner among his peers for the Ballon d'Or with 37.66 per cent of total votes cast by a panel made up of captains, coaches and media members from all FIFA affiliate associations.

The star forward beat perennial rival Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to the gong. Messi took second place with 15.76 per cent of the votes, just ahead of Neuer on 15.72.

Bale had been a contender after a superb first year with Madrid but missed out.

He at least got votes from his Wales manager Chris Coleman and captain Ashley Williams, as well as England skipper Wayne Rooney.
