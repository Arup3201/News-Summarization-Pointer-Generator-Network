F&F's new collection may be sold in Tesco, but with its glossy Louis Vuitton-esque campaign and sumptuous faux furs, it looks fresh off the catwalks - and costs a fraction of the price.

This season sees the label take on a high fashion feel with luxe fabrics, lace camis and soft cashmere  creating a luxurious and elegant new collection.

There's longer hemlines for the more mature lady and 60’s-inspired mini skirts for the more daring dressers.

Swanky! F&F, which is sold at Tesco, has unveiled its slick new campaign imagery, which is reminiscent of Marc Jacob's for Louis Vuitton (Coat, £40, cardigan, £65, chemise, £25)

The brand have taken layering, which is key this season, into account with their offering of coats, sweaters, skirts and trousers in mixed fabrications.  

The collection moves from light to darkness in dramatic colour palettes of black and grey with dark berry shades and metallics.

This is reflected in the moody campaign imagery reminiscent of Marc Jacobs' recent offering for Louis Vuitton starring Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger as ladies of the night.

Luxe: Fur is offered in every size, shape and colour splashed across oversized coats and stoles (Coat, £65. trouser, £25, shirt, £14)

High fashion: The delicate floral gowns, which come with floor length hemlines, offer a more subtle take on the season's artistic mood (Coat, £40, dress, £18)

Who needs accessories? Metallics and heavily embellished clothes signal a new way to wear jewellery this season 

Layer upon layer: The brand have taken layering, which is key this season, into account with their offering of coats, camis, sharp tailored blazers and faux fur stoles (Stole, £20, cardigan, £65, jacquard skirt, £18)

Sheer black separates, which are mixed with heavier pieces, add a touch of 90’s goth, while embellishment and bejewelled fabrics add opulence to the heirloom gowns.

While head-to-toe wooly knits dominated the catwalks, F&F's new drop, which lands in-store and online on September 1, lets you experiment with the trend offering fur, in every size, shape and colour splashed across oversized coats and stoles.

It's a man's world: Androgynous suits have been given a sexy, feminine edge this season so you can wear them from the boardroom to the bar (Coat, £40, lace body, £16, suit, £30)
