Brits who are heading abroad on their summer holidays may want to think twice about taking in the sights on a motorbike.

That’s because a motorbike accident can lead to the most expensive injury claims – with the average medical bill topping £7,000 – for those who didn’t plan ahead and purchase a suitable travel insurance policy.

A cycling accident (£6,262) and tripping on stairs (£2,422) are the second and third most expensive holiday mishaps, according to a study by TravelSupermarket.

Incredibly risky: A quarter of Brits are travelling abroad without the protection of travel insurance

Released at the height of the summer travel season, the ‘holiday injury index’ calculated and compared healthcare costs for common injury claims in six popular destinations – Spain, Greece/Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Thailand and US/Canada.

Of the five most expensive injuries, falling in a bathroom ranked fourth (£2,071) and slipping by the pool was fifth (£1,547). 

Holidaymakers will want to take care if they are riding a bicycle in North America.

Uninsured Brits can face sky-high healthcare costs if they are injured in a cycling accident in the US or Canada

Falling off a bike in the US or Canada could result in painful medical bills of more than £18,000 – almost 18 times more than the same accident in Greece or Cyprus, the study found.

If you’re bitten by an animal, it's best if it doesn’t occur in Spain. Medical treatment for a bite – one of the cheapest injuries to treat – is three times more expensive in Spain than it is in Turkey.

There is some good news if you’re injured by broken glass in Thailand. That’s because you will spend 20 per cent less on medical costs than you would for the same injury in Greece or Cyprus.

Read the fine print: Analyse your travel insurance policy closely so that you know exactly what it covers

Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said a quarter of Brits take the ‘incredibly risky’ step of travelling abroad without insurance.

Many aren’t aware that when they travel within Europe the EHIC card only guarantees they will receive the same level of care as locals within the country they are visiting, Atkinson said.

The level of care could be less comprehensive than the care they would receive in the UK.

Atkinson said: ‘Without a travel insurance policy, you may end up having to pay for treatment with no possibility of recovering costs.

‘It’s really important that you pick the right travel insurance policy to suit your needs, whether you will be relaxing on a beach with a group of friends or going on a family holiday.’

He added: ‘Make sure that you don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you don’t need to get travel insurance if you are lying by a pool for a week, as you could be faced with high costs if you cut yourself on broken glass or slip in the bathroom after a day in the sun.’
