The news that Alan Pardew has quit Newcastle United to become manager at his former club Crystal Palace rocked football on Monday.

Pardew will sign a four-year contract, worth around £2m-a-season, after a compensation package was thrashed out between the two clubs.

As Pardew prepares to leave Toon, Sportsmail's Craig Hope gauged the reaction to his departure on the streets of Newcastle.

And with the likes of Tim Sherwood, Tony Pulis, Eddie Howe, Steve McClaren and Steve Bruce in the frame to replace Pardew, we ask the fans who they would like to see come in.

Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse leaves the club's training ground as the news sinks in that Pardew is to leave the club. Cisse accepted an FA charge of violent conduct for elbowing Everton defender Seamus Coleman 

Pardew ducked the post-match press conference after Newcastle's 3-2 victory against Everton on Sunday and agreed to move to Selhurst Park once the clubs reached a deal.

The 53-year-old boss has faced various campaigns calling for his resignation or dismissal by sections of Newcastle supporters throughout his turbulent reign at the club.

Owner Mike Ashley, who did not attend the victory over Everton, has been plotting his next move from his holiday retreat in Barbados.

The billionaire is wary of the upheaval when his manager quits the club and will also need to find a replacement prepared to work under his demanding ways.

Pardew, who has a property in Surrey a short distance from Palace’s Beckenham HQ, is known to be frustrated after being told at a Newcastle transfer meeting four weeks ago that there would be no money to spend in January.

Instead there is the possibility that Moussa Sissoko will leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest in the France midfielder.

Newcastle are ninth in the Barclays Premier League following the victory over Everton and Ashley is happy with the team’s progress following their poor start to the season.

Pardew, who wanted to progress and challenge for honours, expected Ashley to make funds available to strengthen the team.

Instead the Newcastle owner, who had an excellent relationship with his manager, appears content with the current squad.

Pardew, who  scored the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990, is currently at his family home in Surrey.

Reaction was mixed on the streets of Newcastle, with some fans saying Pardew was harshly treated and others saying it was the correct decision to leave 

Sportsmail asked Newcastle fans for their reaction to Pardew's departure and who should replace him

Meanwhile, Papiss Cisse has accepted a Football Association charge of violent conduct following his elbow on EVerton's Seamus Coleman on Sunday.

The striker will now await confirmation of a three-game ban. With Cisse expected to play with Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations next month, he could miss seven matches for Newcastle. 

A Newcastle statement read: 'Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has accepted a charge of violent conduct from the Football Association.

'Cisse was involved in an incident involving Everton's Seamus Coleman during the Barclays Premier League fixture at St James' Park on Sunday December 28.

'Cisse has accepted the charge and will now serve a three-match suspension, which starts with immediate effect.'

His four-year tenure at St James' Park was a turbulent one, with fan protests marking his final months
