Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes Wayne Rooney is transforming into the new Paul Scholes after the Manchester United captain impressed in midfield during his side's 3-0 win against Liverpool.

Louis van Gaal decided to deploy Rooney in a midfield three alongside Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata, while James Wilson was given the nod to start in attack alongside Robin van Persie.

And Solskjaer, who represented Manchester United for 11 years before retiring in 2007, believes Rooney is capable of filling the void left by Scholes.

Solskjaer, speaking on Sky Sports' Super Sunday after watching his former side win their sixth consecutive game, said: 'I think we found a new position for Wayne Rooney, every day he looks more and more like Paul Scholes.

'The difference today was on 20 minutes when Mata and Rooney adjusted their positions slightly with Mata in behind (Steven) Gerrard and (Joe) Allen and Rooney dropping off, getting on the ball.

'United needed someone to get on the ball and that’s what Rooney did.'

Manchester United boss Van Gaal said after the match that Rooney is likely to play in attack against Aston Villa on Saturday.

'But maybe next week Rooney is a striker again, but not a goalkeeper I think,' joked Van Gaal.
