Education Secretary Michael Gove's reforms of the A-Level system have come under fire from the Russell Group of top universities

Britain's's top universities have warned against radical Government plans to hive off AS-levels as a standalone qualification.

They said they were 'not convinced' that the move is necessary, and raised concerns that without a direct link to A-levels, new-style AS-levels may not be as beneficial.

AS-levels in their current form are valued by universities, allow students to study a broader range of subjects and can encourage bright pupils from poorer backgrounds to continue their studies, according to the Russell Group.

Under a major shake-up of A-levels, announced by Education Secretary Michael Gove last month, AS-levels are set to be separated from A-levels to become a qualification in their own right.

Teenagers taking A-levels will no longer sit exams after one year, and will instead be tested at the end of their two-year course.

Setting out his plans, Mr Gove said he had concluded that there was a 'compelling case' for a move to A-levels with final exams.

But Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group - which represents a group of 24 universities including Oxford and Cambridge - suggested they had some concerns about the proposals.

'AS-levels in their existing form are valued by universities,' she said.

'We have argued that AS-levels in their current format are important in giving students the opportunity to take an additional smaller qualification in a contrasting subject alongside their main A-level subjects.

'This adds valuable breadth and flexibility to their learning programme, and can encourage the take-up of strategically important subjects.

'We are not convinced therefore that a new standalone AS qualification is necessary and are concerned that, with no links to the A-level, it may not deliver the same benefits as the existing AS-levels.'

The Russell Group says AS-Levels in their current form allow students to study a broader range
of subjects and can encourage bright pupils from poorer backgrounds to 
continue their studies

Dr Piatt said that results from AS-levels taken by sixth-formers at the end of their first year of study are useful to universities when looking at applications, particularly for the most competitive courses.

'Without access to such information, it will be even more difficult for our institutions to identify the most talented students from amongst the very many applicants with excellent results at GCSE.

'AS-level results after one year of study can also be effective in giving talented students from poorer backgrounds the confidence to apply to a highly selective university, thus helping to widen participation.'

Dr Piatt added: 'Whilst we have welcomed the Government's review of the modular structure of the A-level, we do not believe this need be extended to the complete removal of the AS examination from the A-level.'
