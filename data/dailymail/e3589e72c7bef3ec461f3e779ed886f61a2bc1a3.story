British record signing Angel di Maria revealed he feels right at home at Manchester United as he settles into life in the Premier League. 

And the Argentinian winger added that he's confident he made the right career move swapping Real Madrid for Old Trafford.  

He told MUTV: 'Leaving a club like Real and coming to a club as big as Manchester United makes you grow as a player and helps you progress in your career.

'It was a very important moment and I'm really happy here.' 

The former Benfica player moved to Manchester United in a huge £60million deal in August.

And it hasn't taken long for him to impress, scoring two goals already - including an astonishing chip in the 5-3 defeat at Leicester. 

Di Maria sees himself staying at the club for years to come and thanked the fans for giving him such a warm reception.

He has also thrown himself into the history of the club, visiting the Manchester United Museum 

He added: 'With every day that goes by, I get much more relaxed and settled here. I've got a house and my family are happy. 

'Since the day I arrived, people have shown real warmth towards me - at every corner kick, free kick, or even during open play, every time I have the ball I feel they're right behind me.'
