Liverpool are back in Europe's elite competition after five long years without Champions League football at Anfield. Brendan Rodgers' squad must put the misery of a 1-0 home loss to Aston Villa behind them and focus on a potentially tricky Ludogorets outfit.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

This is the first competitive meeting between Liverpool and Ludogorets.

Liverpool have won six of their eight encounters with Bulgarian sides but lost the last one; a 0-1 defeat at home against CSKA Sofia in the 2005/06 Champions League qualifiers. That’s the last time a Bulgarian side won an away game against an English side in European competition.

Ludogorets have only lost two of their last eight away games in European competition (W4 D2), both 1-0 defeats (against Valencia and Steaua Bucharest).

Liverpool are taking part in the Champions League for the ninth time. Their last appearance in the competition was in 2009/10.

Liverpool have won the European Cup/Champions League on five occasions: 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005. Only Real Madrid (10) and AC Milan (7) have been more successful.

Liverpool's last Champions League game came in 2009 when Fiorentina helped dump the Reds out the group stage with a 2-1 win at Anfield. Here Martin Jorgensen celebrates equalising for the Italian side on the night

In their last group stage appearance (2009/10), Liverpool never scored more than one goal in a game (five goals in six matches).

Liverpool have only won two of their last eight Champions League games (L4 D2), both were against Hungarian side Debrecen (2009/10).

Ludogorets are one of two clubs to make their first Champions League appearance this season (since 1992/93), alongside Malmo.

The only previous Bulgarian side to take part in the Champions League were Levski Sofia in 2006/07. They lost all six of their games, scoring one goal and conceding 17.

Ludogorets beat Dudelange, Partizan Belgrade and Steaua Bucarest in the qualifiers to reach this season’s group stages.

Ludogorets won all three of their away games in last season’s Europa League group stages (against Chornomorets Odesa, Dinamo Zagreb and PSV Eindhoven).

Penalties excluded, Mario Balotelli has only scored four goals in 29 Champions League games.
