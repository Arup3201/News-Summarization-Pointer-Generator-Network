Florida homeowners may be used to spying cats wandering through their yards - but nothing prepared one resident for a feline so big he thought it was a panther.

The man, who did not want to be identified, said he was stunned when he saw the oversized cat taking a walk through his back garden in West Miramar as he sat down for breakfast.

He grabbed his camera and shared footage with NBC6 showing the beast roaming the lawn - and the nonchalant animal was clearly not too worried about being seen.

After the footage was viewed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, officials confirmed it was not a panther but a bobcat - albeit a very large one.

Mysterious: A South Florida resident captured this cat on film as it wandered through his garden. The size of the animal led him to believe it was a rare Florida Panther - but officials say it was a bobcat

Taking a stroll: The animal appeared to be in no rush as it wandered through the back yard

The homeowner recounted his shock at seeing the cat walking on his lawn.

'I told my wife, "Look at this big dog",' the homeowner said. 'Then the dog crossed over and got into the yard and she told me, "That's not a dog, that's a cat." And I realized it's a cat, but it's a big cat.'

He said he was scared at first but also said he though it was 'cool'. 

Even though it was not a panther, the man said he still has concerns about the cat. 

'I just want the whole neighborhood to be safe,' he said. 'And if it's hungry or if it's cornered, it could become a danger to everybody.

'All I want is for it to be caught and driven away. I don't want it to be hurt and I don't want it to hurt anyone either.' 

Similarities: The coloring of the cat resembles the Florida Panther (file image), but there are only 100 left

Spotted: The cat was actually a bobcat (file picture) although it appeared to be much larger

While it would not have been impossible for him to see a panther, it would be rare. The National Wildlife Federations reports that there are fewer than 100 Florida panthers in the wild.

The endangered cats live in southern Florida in swamplands like the Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve.

Still, the bobcat appeared extremely large, much bigger than the average length of 32 inches. By comparison, a Florida panther is 78 inches.

Unlike the number of panthers, the bobcat population is stable. There are thought to be more than two million across the U.S., according to the International Society for Endangered Cats.

They can be found in deep forest, swamps and suburban neighborhoods.
