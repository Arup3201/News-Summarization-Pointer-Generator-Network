New signing: But he will return to Lille on loan for the remainder of the coming season

'I am very, very happy and delighted a club as big as Liverpool showed interest in me. I'm very excited,' he told the official club website.

'I was very happy because I know that Liverpool are a big club. I was very excited and knew this could be something big for me.

'For me, it was my dream to play for a big club. I know Liverpool is a club with a great history, so for me it was perfect.

'I always watched Liverpool on the TV when I was small and if you see players like Gerrard and Sturridge, it's exciting to know that you're going to be playing with them.

'I watched practically every game of Liverpool's. They had a great season. You could see there was a great mix of experienced and young players, and a good coach. It was nice to see them play.

'I am very proud to sign for the club. I'll give everything for the club, like I did when I was small and did for Lille. I'm hoping we can achieve great things together.'

Pleased as punch: Brendan Rodgers is delighted with securing the youngster's signature

And Rodgers spoke of his delight at securing the youngster's signature. He joins Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic and Dejan Lovren on the list of new recruits.

'For me, he can be one of the most exciting talents in world football. I genuinely believe that,' he told the Liverpool website.

'You see a lot of good players, but this kid - for 19 years of age - he burst onto the scene at the World Cup, but we'd tracked him before that, we'd seen him as a young player playing in the youth internationals. He has everything to be world class.

'He's super fast, has a wonderful touch, he's a good size and is aggressive. What I like, and what I have in other players, is that humility to work hard.

'I've seen enough of him over the course of the last couple of seasons to think this is a kid who, coming into the right environment, can genuinely be world class.

'He will go back to Lille and play there for the season on loan, but by signing him, we'll have a wonderful player - not only now when he comes in next season, but also in the future.

'He can light up world football, for sure.'
