The European Tour has implemented a points system for the new season in the hope of simplifying the Race to Dubai.

There was some confusion last term when the Tour converted euros earned into points ahead of the Final Series, with each of the final four events of the season having 10million points on offer in the Race as opposed to its prize money total.

That system will remain in place for the Final Series but throughout the season one euro earned will equal one Race to Dubai point from the very first event - which takes place this week at the Nedbank Golf Challenge - until the Hong Kong Open in October.

The enhanced points system will then apply for the BMW Masters, WGC-HSBC Champions, Turkish Airlines Open and DP World Tour Championship, with the man with the most points being awarded the Harry Vardon Trophy.

The points will not be reset before the Final Series like they are for the FedEx Cup on the PGA Tour.

'Following the success of The 2014 Race to Dubai, won by Rory McIlroy for the second time in three years after a superb season, The European Tour has decided to implement a points system for the duration of the 2015 campaign,' said Chief Operating Officer of the European Tour Keith Waters.

The points system will change for next season, with one euro earned equalling one points from first event

'We believe that changing to a points system will help simplify and indeed enhance the narrative structure of The Race to Dubai, and particularly the Final Series which will again carry a combined 40 million points, with 1,666,600 points on offer to the winner of each event.

'The conversion to a points system will complement an exciting and robust schedule in 2015, which will feature a minimum of 47 tournaments, including the addition of five new events.'

McIlroy won this season's Race to Dubai despite only taking part in one of the Final Series following his four victories which included the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship.
