She may have admitted that she was close to pulling the plug 
on her lifestyle newsletter after receiving a wave of criticism back in 2011, but judging by her latest installment, Gwyneth Paltrow has certainly changed her tune.

The actress - whose endeavours have been labelled pretentious and out of touch by some critics - has unveiled a new collection of bar accessories on her Goop blog.

But forget plastic cocktail glasses and umbrella straws, Gwyneth's selection of 'unique and individual pieces' are slightly out of the price range of the average drinker.

A load of Goop? Gwyneth Paltrow, whose lifestyle website has been met by much criticism, has now unveiled a range of bar accessories starting at £616

The 40-year-old is offering sterling silver shot glasses for £616 ($950) as well as a pair of glass and sterling silver decanters for an eye-watering £2917 ($4495).

On her Goop page, she writes: 'For stocking a bar that is as useful as it is good looking, we've gone to Foundwell for unique accessories from jiggers to muddlers and more.'

Describing the £616 shot glass, she writes: 'This sterling shot cup has the phrase "Just a thimble full" engraved on it - a gentle reminder to practice a little bit of restraint.

'A great gift or a fun conversation piece for your home bar.'

Long shot: Her shot glasses at £616, and she describes them as 'a great gift or a fun conversation piece for your home bar'

The actress launched Goop back in September 2008, a personal website where she dishes 
out advice to her readers and encourages them to 'nourish the inner 
aspect'.

Each week the newsletter focuses on a subject area, split into Make, Go, Get, Do, Be, and See.

In an interview with the March 2011 issue of Harper's Bazaar UK, she admitted: 'There were a couple of times when I thought 'I'm just gonna stop doing it.

'People are so mean to me. I don't want to do it.

'But
 then I was like, "Who cares what some lame person out there says?" I 
was in Italy once, and this old man came up to me and said, "I had the 
best time in Nashville because of Goop." And that is so worth it to me.'

She has previously written about a 21-day Goop cleanse as well as given readers tips on  how to update their spring wardrobe, but her outfit recommendations add up to over £300,000.

Expensive drinking habits: Gwyneth is also selling a pair of glass and sterling silver decanters for a cool £2917

Shaken or stirred: Golf club stirrers are on offer for £321 as well as an art deco cocktail shaker for £616

More money than sense: Gwyneth Paltrow's Spring wardrobe recommendations totted up to an eye-watering figure too

Gwynnie does, however, maintain that she is completely normal just like the rest of us mere mortals.

She recently said: ‘One of my most negative 
qualities is . . . perfectionism . . . it comes from self-doubt and 
insecurity.

' I’m just a normal mother with the same struggles as any
 other... trying to do everything at once, trying to be a wife and 
maintain a relationship.’
