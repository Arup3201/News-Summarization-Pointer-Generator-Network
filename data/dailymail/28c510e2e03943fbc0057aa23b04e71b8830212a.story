Denim Llewellyn, 19, has been handed a nine-week prison sentence for obstructing a railway line after he entered the tunnel in South Wales on March 12

A cyclist who took a shortcut through a busy railway tunnel, causing trains to be suspended for 14 hours, has been handed a prison sentence.

Denim Llewellyn, 19, risked his life by entering the half-mile tunnel on the commuter line between Cardiff and Caerphilly in South Wales, at rush hour.

Passengers watched the 'reckless idiot' in disbelief as he cycled along the train tracks and ignored their warnings of the dangers involved.

The teenager, who is currently at Cardiff Prison serving a nine-month sentence for unlawful wounding, has been handed another jail sentence after admitting to obstructing the railway line.

Appearing via video link from the prison, he was given a nine-week jail term for the offence which Judge Eleri Rees told him 'put his life at risk and endangered others'.

Prosecutor Ian Colvin said the incident occurred on March 12 this year, and told Cardiff Crown Court that the alarm was raised when the cyclist disappeared into the tunnel.

Trains on the busy line were placed on caution at first before the services were suspended while police searched the track, fearing he could be trapped inside.

Mr Colvin said: 'Llewellyn was seen with a push bike on Caerphilly train station at 6.45am.

'Llewellyn entered a 950 yard long railway tunnel which caused trains to be stopped completely.

'Anyone walking through that tunnel put themselves and others in considerable danger.'

He said the train driver got out to speak to Llewellyn and told him: 'You're going to get yourself killed.'

But Llewellyn ignored this and other warnings to get off the track.

Mr Colvin said: 'Rush hour trains were delayed by 85 minutes and there had been 23 cancellations costing £6,380.'

The 19-year-old ignored warnings from rail passengers and a train driver as he entered the half-mile tunnel

British Transport Police released CCTV photos of the cyclist wheeling along the train tracks into the mile-long tunnel, which later led to him being identified and tracked to London where he was arrested.

Huw Wallace, defending, said: 'He has learned a valuable lesson. He apologises to all those passengers who had their time wasted.'

Recorder Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'You not only put your own life at risk but endangered the lives of others who had to tackle the problem.

'You were obstinate and ignored warnings. There was an arrogance in the way you acted, causing disruption and inconveniences to others,'

Llewellyn cycled off the end of Caerphilly station platform, causing 14 hours of delays on the main railway line

British Transport Police spokesman Morgan Andrews said he was shocked by the incident and the risk taken by Llewellyn.

He said: 'I am genuinely shocked to see that, despite our constant warnings some people are still willing to risk their lives by trespassing on the tracks.

'This was absolutely senseless behaviour and I cannot overstate just how dangerous it is.'

Llewellyn's nine-week sentence will run consecutive to the nine-month sentence he is currently serving, which was imposed last month.
