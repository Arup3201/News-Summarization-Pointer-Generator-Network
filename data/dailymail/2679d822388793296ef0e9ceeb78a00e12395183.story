The compact accommodation is all arranged within the octagonal ground floor section and includes a kitchen, sitting room, dining area, double bedroom, 2 single bedrooms and a shower room

'It combines great charm and character with a truly stunning location right on the River Bure, set at the very heart of The Norfolk Broads. It really is the perfect holiday home.'

The building was once known as a 'smock mill', which was used as a drainage mill, also known as a windpump, to control the level of the water on the low lying land or marshes.

The building today is very different to the original mill. It was once a dark wood structure with a slim tower, but it is now painted white, giving it a an overall Dutch appearance.
