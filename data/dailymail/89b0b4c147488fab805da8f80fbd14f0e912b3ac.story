Winter storm Walda brought blizzard 
conditions to the Mountain West on Tuesday as parts of Colorado were affected by 20 inches of snow.

Denver
International Airport canceled 300 flights and warned travelers to be ready for delays as planes were de-iced. 
About half of the cancellations were commuter flights, officials said. Many schools and public offices were also shut due to snowfall.

It was an altogether different story on the East Coast with sunshine and highs of 80F predicted throughout Tuesday.

capital has seen temperatures above 80 since October. New York City 
reported highs of 75F.

On the West Coast, winds as powerful as 70mph
in California toppled trees and caused scattered power outages on 
Monday.

Forecasters warned that blinding dust storms would likely reduce
visibility and cause dangerous driving conditions in the region again 
today.

Whitecaps flecked the Pacific Ocean 
along the California coast, where gale warnings and small craft

at points such as Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles 
County coast.

The wind 
turned small wildfires into big problems in some areas, including a 
blaze in Fillmore about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles that burned 
two homes and forced the evacuation of 84 homes.

Blowing dust forced the closure of 
state Route 14 in the high desert Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles 
due to low visibility.

Officer Michael Farrell said motorists who 
stopped on the road were hit from behind by other cars, but no major 
injuries were reported.

The power went out for more than 13,000 Southern Californians because of the winds and the weather.

The rush of air had an upside: 
California's main power grid manager, the Independent System Operator, 
reported that turbines spinning within the ISO grid produced a record of
4,196 megawatts Sunday. The previous record was 3,944 megawatts on 
March 3.

In Arizona, gusty winds produced by a 
cold front enveloped Phoenix in a dusty haze and closed 34 miles of 
Interstate 40 in the northern part of the state for several hours 
Monday.

At least four people were injured in a pileup when two 
semi-trucks jackknifed in a dust storm on I-10 in southern Arizona. The 
injuries were not life-threatening.
