A woman who married a man she met as a teenager still sees him as a young man - because she lost her sight by the time they'd been reunited.

Joanne Roberts, now 47, met David at a holiday camp in Scotland when she was five years old but love didn't blossom initially for the pair.

They later reunited at his brother's 40th - and ended up falling in love and tying the knot. However, Joanne had gone blind by then so still pictures him as the young man she met all those years ago.

Joanne Roberts, now 47, met David when they were children but they lost touch. By the time they had reunited, she had lost her sight so still remembers him as a young man

Speaking to FEMAIL about her love story, she said: 'I can’t really remember Dave until about the age of 9 or 10. Then he was a "man" of 16 and that's my last memory.

'He was always very funny and we bonded over humour. We laughed at exactly the same things, and remember: he’s almost a Scouser and I’m almost a Geordie. Whenever they get together there’s always a few sparks.'

The couple, pictured on holiday in 2010, later reunited at his brother's 40th and soon married

Love didn't initially blossom for the pair - and Joanne even attended Dave's first wedding as a guest.

Meanwhile, Joanne, from Little Sutton, Cheshire, was enjoying a career as a high-flying businesswoman, whose work in marketing took her to Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.

After returning to London, she set up a marketing agency and was enjoying life as a city dweller until she tragically lost her sight.  

Joanne went blind at 34 due to type 1 diabetes diagnosed at the age of 14. 

As well as losing her sight,  Joanne’s kidney function is half of a healthy person. She was also forced to have a pancreas transplant six years ago to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks.

Love didn't initially blossom for the pair - and Joanne even attended Dave's first wedding as a guest but they bonded over their humour 

After her diagnosis, Joanne attended Dave's brother's 40th birthday celebrations and she and Dave got on so well, it was clear that something was blossoming between the pair. 

They married in 2008 and Joanne credits Dave for helping her come to terms with losing her sight and helping her stay positive. 

'He’s helped me by challenging me to do stuff I’ve never done before,' she said.

'I ride pillion on his motorbike and go away in a motorhome. Also, he doesn’t suffer fools gladly, and won’t let me play on my disability to get out of anything. 

'Best of all, he still makes me laugh like no one else can.'

Joanne has shared her experience in her new book, Confessions of a Guide Dog,  written from the view point of her black Labrador of eight years

As well as Dave helping her come to terms with losing her sight, her guide dog Uska has become an indispensable part of her life - and even walked her down the aisle when she married Dave.

Speaking about her dog, she said: 'Yes there were many serious issues facing me when I went blind, but gradually, like the easing of grief after the death of someone you love, I realised I could cope without my eyes.

'I was lucky because I never lost my sense of humour. Then I got Uska. As well as the freedom and self-respect of independence, his character brought me laughter every day. Is it any wonder I love this dog like my own flesh and blood?'.

And now, Joanne has shared her experience in her new book, Confessions of a Guide Dog, which is written from the view point of her black Labrador of eight years, Uska.

Speaking about her new book written in honour of her dog, Joanne said: 'It's about life with my fabulous, laid-back guide dog. However, back in the beginning there were a few mishaps and occasional guiding disasters as we learnt how to work together. 

'These have gained legendary status and aim to shed a little light on the funnier side of a blind person’s life.' 

The story of their first year together is available to download from Apple or Amazon Books, with 25 per cent of her royalties going to Guide Dogs for the Blind. Joanne hopes to raise enough money to sponsor another Guide Dog and be able to name him USKA II, after her boy.
