Chloe Madely has urged her TV presenter parents Richard and Judy to cut down on their drinking and get fit.

The health-conscious 27-year-old regularly posts photographs of her toned body on her Twitter account, and is now encouraging the couple to start their own fitness regime.

She says she has shown her father, Richard Madeley, 58, how to lift a barbell, and with her encouragement he and wife Judy Finnigan, 66, now take half-hour walks every day.

'I’m taking steps to encourage my parents to become fitter,' she told Woman magazine.

'I also want them to cut down on alcohol. They don’t drink loads – but they drink enough.'

While working on their Channel 4 afternoon show in 2004, Madeley and Finnigan set up their own wine club, releasing a book on wine to tie in with the series the following year. 

Viewers were able to pre-order the wines tasted on the programme so they could sample the drinks themselves while watching the couple and their guests discuss them on screen.

In 2009, Chloe revealed her father had branded her 'an idiot' after she crashed her Peugot 206 into a parked Mini, which overturned her car. 

She was nearly twice over the legal limit after drinking 'two cocktails' on a night out in London, and was banned from driving for 20 months.

Chloe is now often seen working out and follows a low-carbohydrate diet, but admitted last week that she did need a little encouragement from her mother. 

She told her Twitter followers that she had said to Finnigan that she wanted some chocolate, only to be told: '"No! Don't give up now! You've worked so hard and you're at the halfway point!'"

Expressing her gratitude for her mum's encouragement, she tweeted: 'God I love her!'

Madeley and Finnigan were recently forced to make a formal complaint to the police after online rape threats were made against Chloe.

She was threatened on Twitter after she defended comments made by Finnigan during a debate around the future of footballer rapist Ched Evans, in which her mother said his crime was 'non-violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm'.

Chloe said: 'My mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society.

'The comments she made on the case in question were facts, so not opinions. While it may anger some that the term "non-violent rape" exists, unfortunately it does.

'Referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable.

'To believe that my mother is pro "non-violent rape" is ridiculous and I am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion.

'To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'An allegation of harassment was made to Barnet police relating to messages received via a social media site.

'A criminal investigation has commenced. There are no arrests at this stage but enquiries continue.'
