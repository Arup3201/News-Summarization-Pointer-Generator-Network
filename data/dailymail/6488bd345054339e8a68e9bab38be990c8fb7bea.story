Benefit cheat: Patrick Wildman who was filmed walking despite his claims that he needed a wheelchair

A benefits cheat who uses a wheelchair was secretly filmed walking around a city - like comedy character Andy from Little Britain.

Ex bus driver Patrick Wildman has been convicted of benefit fraud after pocketing more than £27,000 over seven and a half years.

The 47 year old told the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) that he was 'in constant pain' and could not walk without a stick or support from someone else.

But Plymouth Crown Court heard that he was working as a delivery driver and a bus driver while claiming disability benefits.

The jury was shown covert video footage of Wildman walking freely around Plymouth city centre in November 2009 (pix sent in this morning by me).

The footage was similar to the scenes in the TV comedy Little Britain where wheelchair bound Andy would get out of his chair and do stunts behind the back of his carer Lou.

After a three day trial Wildman, from Plymouth, was convicted of failing to notify a change of circumstances that would affect his benefit claim.Wildman, who sat next to the dock in his wheelchair, was today sentenced to 36 weeks in jail suspended for two years.

Defence lawyer Jason Beal said in mitigation: 'The prosecution case is not that he was faking an illness but his mobility needs were not properly declared.'

He said Wildman was now permanently in a wheelchair because his medical condition has worsened.

He said he is paying back the £27,626
and may take a considerable time if ever to pay it off - through 
deductions from his £80 a week benefits.

Judge Paul Darlow said: 'Over a 
period of some seven and a half years you continued to claim and receive
benefits to which you were not entitled because in fact your health was
not as you were portraying. You received £27,000 worth of taxpayers 
money wrongly.'

And the judge said it was debatable 
whether Wildman - who has a previous conviction for benefit fraud in 
1995 - would be able to pay back all the money.

Prosecutor Edward Bailey had told the
jury that Wildman had received disability living allowance from 1994 as
he was 'virtually unable to walk'.

He said in 2000 Wildman repeated in a claim form that he could only walk with a stick or with the support of his partner.

He claimed he was in 'constant pain' in is back and legs because of spinal disease.

Mr Bailey said in 2009 filled in 
another form saying he could only walk with a stick, often needed to 
stop and was in severe pain.

In that year he did tell officials he was a local bus driver.

But investigators found that from 2002 he had worked for a local window company loading unloading heavy uPVC windows.

The prosecutor said Wildman also worked for a firm delivering papers, often in bulk, between 2004-2006.

Mr Bailey said he failed to declare 
any health problems to his employers and did not tell the DWP about his 
work until 2009 because he was being dishonest.

He said: 'He claimed he was virtually unable to walk and yet he was able to perform these jobs.'

Wildman maintained he was in constant
pain even when he was seen walking through the city centre carrying a 
rucksack and wearing a yellow fluorescent jacket.

He claimed his now estranged wife would travel with him and help unload the windows, doors and newspapers.

Wildman claimed he had never seen the annual letter reminding him to tell the DWP of any changes in his condition.

A DWP spokesman said: 'Benefit 
thieves are costing the taxpayer £1.2 billion per year. This money is 
intended to help those most in need, not line the pockets of criminals.'

After he was sentenced, Wildman said to friends outside the court: 'That's a relief.
