Shamed footballer Marlon King has been arrested after a Porsche was involved in a three-car crash that left a man seriously injured in hospital.

The Birmingham City striker was detained on suspicion of dangerous driving after the sports car collided with two other vehicles in Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire, yesterday.

A 35-year-old man was airlifted to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham following the smash on the Lincoln-bound carriageway of the A46/A17 interchange at around 2.50pm.

The crash follows the footballer's 2009 conviction for sexual assaulting a student in a London nightclub, for which he was jailed.

Championship player King, who turned 33 yesterday, was released on police bail last night pending further inquiries into the three-car crash.

The road was closed for two and a half hours following the incident, which also involved a Volkswagen Polo and a Vauxhall Astra.

Other occupants of the cars sustained whiplash injuries in the crash.

King, whose previous clubs include 
Watford, Middlesborough and Coventry City, was sentenced to 18 months in
prison in October 2009 after being convicted of sexual assault and 
assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Conviction: King was convicted of sexual assault in October 2009

The
player was on loan to Hull from Wigan Athletic when he groped and 
punched a young student in a London nightclub in December 2008.

King had been out in Soho celebrating 
his wife becoming pregnant with the couple's third child when he groped the then 20-year-old student's bottom.

When she protested, the 6ft1in footballer punched her, knocking her to the ground and splitting her lip.

King, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison following his conviction at Southwark Crown Court, walked free in July 2010 after serving half of his sentence.

He was immediately sacked by Wigan Athletic.

At the time of his release the footballer, who was told he must remain on the Sex Offenders' Register for seven years, vowed to clear his name and insisted he had been wrongfully convicted of the sexual assault.

It was the second stint behind bars for King, who spent five months in prison in 2002 after being caught driving a stolen BMW.

He returned to the pitch in September 2010 after signing a one-year deal with Coventry City.

King agreed a three-year contract with Birmingham City in 2011.

The club has said it is aware of the crash yesterday.

A Birmingham City spokesman said: 'We are aware of a road traffic accident involving our player and the matter is now being investigated by the police.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
