Alison Glenn has Trigeminal neuralgia, a condition causing extreme facial pain

Alison Glenn was enjoying a meal with friends when she first felt the pain in the right side of her jaw.

'It was a gradual thing, and I thought it must be toothache, so I made an appointment with my dentist a few days later. He thought it was a filling that needed changing,' says Alison, 53, who lives in Cambridgeshire with her husband, Nigel, a software architect, and their three children.

'He replaced the filling and said the pain should start to settle, but it didn't.

'I went back about a week later and this time he thought the tooth might be infected, and so decided to do root canal treatment on it.'

Root canal involves opening the tooth to remove bacteria from the soft tissue inside, and then filling the root of the tooth. It is notoriously uncomfortable and can take several hours - but for Alison it made things worse.

'The pain became extreme. I was having difficulty talking or opening my mouth and painkillers didn't touch it,' she says.

The problem was, there was nothing wrong with Alison's teeth.

In fact, she had trigeminal neuralgia, a condition where the trigeminal nerve - which runs through the face and sends pain messages to the brain - becomes damaged.

Trigeminal neuralgia affects some 19,000 people in the UK and is most common in the over-50s. It causes bouts of severe facial pain, and as the condition is still not well known, these are often mistaken for dental problems with disastrous results.

Many patients endure years of unnecessary dental work - some patients have even had all their teeth removed.

It took 2½ years - and an astonishing four sessions of needless root canal treatment on different teeth - before Alison was given the correct diagnosis.

Not only is trigeminal neuralgia often slow to be picked up, it's thought to be one of the most painful conditions known to medicine. It's even been called the 'suicide disease', because patients can begin to feel suicidal, so debilitating are the symptoms.

Many sufferers describe the pain as like an electric shock, but for Alison it felt 'like a knife stabbing into my jaw'.

GP prescribed carbamazepine, an anti-convulsant that helps with nerve pain, and it got things under control

The condition causes faulty pain messages to be sent, especially when the face is touched. The lightest touch - even a hair brushing against the skin or a gust of wind - can trigger the excruciating feeling, although it can also happen spontaneously.

The neuralgia tends to strike for just a few seconds or minutes.

'I could be sitting talking to a friend and the next minute be in tears with the pain,' says Alison.Eating became difficult, too.

'After the first root canal treatment, I couldn't even put a cup to my mouth,' Alison recalls. 'At one point I was having soup through a straw. I lost about 2st in weight over a period of a few months because eating anything would set it off.' 

She saw her GP who prescribed carbamazepine, an anti-convulsant that helps with nerve pain, and that gradually got things under control.

She also learned to eat on the left side of her mouth, avoided very crunchy foods like apples, and slowly regained some weight.

But as various specialists struggled to work out what was causing the problem, Alison's ability to cope with the outside world started to shrink.

'I couldn't go out in cold weather or wind, as that would set it off; sometimes even the vibration of walking on a gravel path would do it. I couldn't go out to eat and was always worried that if I did go out I would have an attack, so I became very isolated. Even the fear of it happening was enough to set it off.'

Alison also hated the side-effects of her medication.

'It left me drowsy and wanting to sleep all the time. As soon as I had it under control I'd try to reduce the quantity, but if I didn't get it right the pain kicked in again.'

The neuralgia also placed a strain on  her family.

'They were extremely worried about me - my life had completely changed and there was nothing they could do. My daughter recently admitted it was really frightening to see me in such pain.'

Eventually, in late 2010 her dentist referred her to the University College London Eastman Dental Institute where she saw Professor Joanna Zakrzewska, a leading expert in trigeminal neuralgia.

Alison was referred for an MRI scan on her head which confirmed the trigeminal nerve was being compressed

'People had mentioned trigeminal neuralgia before but for some reason my dentist didn't believe that was what I had,' says Alison.

'After examining me,  Professor Zakrzewska knew immediately that was it. It was such a relief to talk to someone who understood totally what I was going through.'

There are two trigeminal nerves, one on each side of the face and each with branches that run around the eye, forehead, cheek, nose, jaw and mouth.

Trigeminal neuralgia seems to occur when the myelin - the material that insulates nerves - wears  away, especially at the point where the nerve  enters the brain, says Professor Zakrzewska.

'All sensation is felt in the brain and interpreted in the brain,' she explains. We think when the myelin is lost, there's some cross circuit between the nerves, so a normal sensation like touch is wrongly interpreted by the brain as pain.

'It's an extremely severe pain, and although it lasts for only a few seconds it can feel continuous because it keeps happening in quick succession.'

People with multiple sclerosis are at raised risk of trigeminal neuralgia, as this condition causes the degeneration of myelin.

However most cases occur in otherwise healthy people due to a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve, wearing away the protective surrounding layer.

It's still not clear why this should happen in some people.

The condition tends to be diagnosed over the age of 50 (although it has been seen in younger people, and even in children) and Professor Zakrzewska speculates it may be a disease associated with ageing. And some studies have linked trigeminal neuralgia with high blood pressure. 'It could be that hypertension causes greater pressure in the blood vessel next to the trigeminal nerve,' she says.

However there are still many unanswered questions surrounding the condition.

'When you operate to move the blood vessel out of the way, 70 per cent of patients will be pain free, but not all of them,' says  Professor Zakrzewska.

'Also, if you scanned the brains of the whole population, you'd see around 15 per cent of people have this blood vessel next to the nerve, but nowhere near that number have trigeminal neuralgia.'

Her team now wants to run genetic studies to see if this has a role.

Awareness
 of trigeminal neuralgia is improving, but Jillie Abbott, of the 
Trigeminal Neuralgia Association, says that misdiagnosis is still a huge
 issue.

'The stories we 
hear really are quite horrifying. Many people have teeth removed or root
 canal treatment; we have heard from people who have had all their teeth
 out, though that's unusual.'

After
 seeing Professor Zakrzewska, Alison was referred for an MRI scan on her
 head which confirmed the trigeminal nerve was being compressed.

The number of people who take time off work for dental problems each year

'I'd had an MRI two years before, but it had shown nothing, apart from ruling out a tumour or multiple sclerosis.

'This time they knew what they were looking for. The neurosurgeon said it clearly picked up the blood vessel pressing on the nerve, and so I'd be a good candidate for surgery.'

 Six months later, in the summer of 2011, she had the two-hour procedure. Surgeons made an incision just behind the ear and drilled through the skull to reach the trigeminal nerve. They then placed a pad made from Teflon fibres next to the blood vessel, to stop it pressing against the nerve, so allowing the myelin to regenerate.

Alison recovered in hospital for four days before going home.

'It was fantastic,' she says. 'It took me a long time to be confident again about things like eating and exercising, because I was so scared of setting it off again.

'But, touch wood, I've been free of pain ever since then.'

Surgery, which is normally suggested only after anticonvulsants have been tried, can be successful for many but in some people the neuralgia can return. In this instance, they may be tried on anti-convulsants again, or they may be offered ablation therapy, where heat or radiation is used to destroy part of the trigeminal nerve itself.

This carries a risk of long-term numbness in the face, but can provide relief from the pain for about four years.

Ablation therapy may also be offered to the minority of people with trigeminal neuralgia where there is no sign the nerve is being pushed against by a blood vessel.

Alison Glenn is crossing her fingers she will remain pain free.

'I consider myself lucky,' she says. 'And I appreciate things now - walking in the wind and seeing friends. But, of course, I do look back and think: “Did I really need to have all that root canal treatment?” '
