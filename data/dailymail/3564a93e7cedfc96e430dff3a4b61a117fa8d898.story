Andriy Shevchenko says new Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli can reignite himself as a fantastic player again after a frustrating spell in Italy with AC Milan.

The maverick forward struggled for form during his 19-month stint at the Italian giants, but Milan legend Shevchenko believes the 24-year-old deserves another chance to turn his career around.

He told La Gazzetta dello Sport: 'If Balotelli wasn't happy at Milan and the club were not satisfied either, it was the right decision to part ways.

Still got it: Milan legend Shevchenko says Balotelli is a fantastic player on his day

'But I saw Mario in action at the European Championship in Ukraine and Poland two years ago and he was a fantastic player. I refuse to believe that's all gone all of a sudden.

'Mario deserves another chance and Liverpool are giving him that chance. Liverpool are a great team and could have the ambition to win the Champions League.

'It's now up to Balotelli to overcome his difficulties and take his fate back in his own hands again.'

Balotelli made his Liverpool start in a convincing 3-0 win for Brendan Rodgers' side at Tottenham on Sunday, impressing during his hour on the pitch although he could and probably should have notched a couple of debut goals.
