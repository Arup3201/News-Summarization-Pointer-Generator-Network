A former New York City police 
officer, acquitted of raping a drunken 
woman after helping her get home, was today sentenced to a year in jail for official misconduct.

Kenneth Moreno, 43, the lead officer in the 'rape cop' case was labelled a corrupt liar who thought he was 'above the law' by prosecutors as he was sentenced.

'When law enforcement officers commit
a crime, they rip at that fabric that holds us together and you, sir, 
ripped a gaping hole in that fabric by committing your crimes,' said 
State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro.

Led away: Kenneth Moreno was today sentenced to a year in jail after he was convicted of misconduct

He blasted Moreno's insistence that he only had chivalrous intentions in 'counselling' and 'spooning' in bed with the semi-naked, vomiting woman.

'You're a trained police officer,' the 
judge told him. 'It's not too far a stretch to believe that you couldn't
avoid being in that bed with a naked female.'

The 29-year-old alleged victim who was sat in the front row as Moreno was sentenced appeared to sob as Moreno was led away.

She had requested to make a victim 
statement during the proceedings, but the judge had refused as she is 
now not legally a victim after Moreno and fellow officer Franklin Mata, 
29, were acquitted of rape.

A grim-looking Kenneth Moreno was led
away after the sentence was pronounced in state Supreme Court.

Moreno and Mata were fired from the police 
department within hours of their convictions for official misconduct in May.

Although acquitted of raping the 
female fashion executive, each was convicted of three counts of 
misconduct for being in the woman's apartment when they were supposed to
be on patrol.

'You were in bed with an intoxicated naked young woman - that is official misconduct,' said Mr Carro.

The judge criticised defence lawyer Joseph Tacopina's argument that Moreno was more of a 'simpleton' than a sexual predator.

'Simpleton like a fox,' Mr Carro said.

'During your testimony, you told a 
story that was incredible,' the judge added. 'Your testimony was classic
for admitting what you couldn’t deny, denying what you couldn’t admit 
and classic tailoring of your testimony to the witnesses who testified 
before you.'

Moreno said he had gone back to the 
woman's apartment three times after the first call - even placing a 
phony 911 call about a sleeping vagrant to provide a pretext for one of 
the visits - only to try to comfort her and give advice about drinking.

People in this city must be able to rely on this, that when they call 
911 for help, the police who arrive will, in fact, help,' Assistant 
District Attorney Coleen Balbert told the judge. 'He demonstrated that 
he had no regard for the law.'

Moreno's lawyer Joseph Tacopina had pressed for probation, noting that the
ex-officer's first-time conviction was for a misdemeanour and already 
has already cost him his 17-year job and his pension. Probation 
officials had said there was no need to jail Moreno, he added.

'I'm going to ask the court to have the same courage that that jury had in rendering that verdict,' Mr Tacopina said.

Some jurors said later that they had too much doubt to convict in a rape
case with an accuser who acknowledged her memories were spotty - and 
without DNA evidence implicating the officers. But the verdict spurred 
outrage from women's advocates, a few of whom demonstrated outside the 
courthouse on Monday.

Mata's sentencing was postponed until Wednesday.

Mata
and Moreno met the drunken woman in December 2008 after a taxi driver 
called for help getting her out of his cab. She told authorities she 
passed out and awoke to being raped in her bed, saying she acutely 
remembered being violated despite being unclear on significant parts of 
the night.

And she secretly recorded a conversation days later in which Moreno alternately denied they had sex but said 'yes' twice when she asked whether he'd used a condom. Moreno told jurors he was trying to mollify her.

The former officers acknowledged returning to her apartment three times without telling dispatchers or supervisors what they were doing - the genesis of their misconduct convictions. In fact, Moreno admitted he even placed a phony 911 call about a sleeping vagrant to provide a pretext for one of the visits.

The officers said she'd asked them to
come back and check on her, and Moreno said he felt impelled to give 
her advice about drinking and to comfort her. He said that she made 
advances and he ultimately ended up cuddling with the barely dressed 
woman in her bed, but that they didn't have sex. Mata said he was 
sleeping on her sofa while the others were in the bedroom.

The
woman said in a statement after the verdict that her 'world was turned 
upside-down by the actions of two police officers who were sent there to
protect but instead took advantage of their authority and broke the 
law.'

The case ignited 
protests from women's advocates, who saw it as a discouraging example of
the difficulty women face in coming forward with a sexual assault 
complaint.

KC Washington, a
member of the National Organization for Women's New York board of 
directors, stood outside the courthouse, holding a sign that said, 
'NYPD: Protect Women.' She said she had been 'horrified' by the rape 
acquittals.

'We can't keep silent,' she said. 'We're just sending a message to the people who make the policies, and the judges, that it's not OK.'

The case ultimately pitted the woman's word, with some support from the recorded conversation, against the officers' denials. At the trial, their lawyers underscored the lack of forensic evidence and the fact that the woman had sued.

I thought she made the whole thing up,' Moreno said after the verdict. In trying to help her, he said, he 'made a judgement call... and I paid for it.'
