Dannii Minogue, Kate Moss and Roger Federer may all come from different walks of the showbiz world - but they all share a little beauty secret.

The singer, model and tennis player are all fans of Sanctuary Spa's youth-boosting beauty products, and while they may have millions in the bank, the range costs less than £20 and is available at Boots.

Dannii Minogue has reportedly become such a fan of the range's £13 Ultimate Facial Cleansing Oil that she's stocked up on the entire range to help keep her wrinkles at bay.

And Kimberley Walsh kept her skin supple with the Therapist's Secret Facial Oil during her pregnancy - while Daisy Lowe credits it for giving her a model glow.

Kate and Roger, along with Keira Knightley, Cate Blanchett, Gisele Bündchen and Hugh Jackman, love treating themselves to a bespoke facial with Sanctuary Spa's celebrity facialist, Nichola Joss, who uses the range on their skin.

Nichola, who reveals Kate Moss and Jamie Hince have couples' facials, said: 'My bespoke facial massage not only feeds and nourishes the skin, it works on the muscle tissue, improving the health and vitality of the muscle and giving a plumper and a more youthful appearance.

'It gives instant results, literally toning and firming the texture of skin.

'Each facial is also designed to address any skincare issues be it deep-cleansing, correction or hydration.

'Celebrities
 love it as they all want radiant, youthful, luminous skin with lots of 
tone and firmness and that is what my facial gives them.

'They also don't have to worry about having blotchy skin afterwards as the facial isn't aggressive on the skin.

'Each of my clients receives a bespoke treatment to suit their skin at the time that they see me so the treatment changes with every appointment but the constant is always the firming, toning and destressing massage.

'Celebrities love this treatment before the red carpet as it is not aggressive on the skin.

If it's good enough for them! A-listers are fans of Sanctuary Spa's youth-boosting range

'It improves the tone and texture of the skin, revealing a healthy, radiant complexion which is what everyone wants for the red carpet, you can't fake healthy skin.

'Sanctuary Spa's Therapist's Secret Facial Oil is my essential products for facials, I get through so much of it during awards season - especially as my clients always want to take the bottle away with them afterwards!

'I intensively massage the oil in to clients skin, pushing it deep in to the skin to nourish, hydrate and plump.

'It's a real superfood for skin and it contains a blend of natural oils to rejuvenate and brighten skin to leave it plump, dewy and golden.'

Nichola is famed for her 'in the mouth' facials - massaging the face internally - which, says Nichola, has more of an impact than from the
outside.

She said she begins with a lymphatic face massage to loosen the muscles. She
 then puts on rubber gloves and administers the rest of the massage to 
the cheeks and along the gums from inside the client’s mouth.

The celebrity facialist adds that the procedure allows the muscles in the cheek and inside the jaw to be
repositioned, ‘bringing everything back to where it should be’.
