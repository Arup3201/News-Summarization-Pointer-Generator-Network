The parents of a teenager who committed suicide on July 17 have filed a claim against their city for negligence after police failed to follow up the boy's social media post stating his intention to kill himself.

Matthew Cline was a 17-year-old high school football player when he shot himself in the head at home with a gun belonging to his parents.

His parents say that on July 16, their son posted on social media site iFunny: 'My name is Matthew Cline. This will be my last post on ifunny as I will be committing suicide tonight.'

Cry for help: Matthew Cline posted his intention to commit suicide on a social networking site

They allege the police knew about the post and had the Clines' address but did not send a car to the home or telephone the Clines to make them aware of the post.

On the evening of July 16, high school student Ana Gutierrez, 17, some 300 miles away from Matthew Cline in Los Banos, saw his iFunny post and became concerned.

She did some sleuthing and managed to locate Cline's Facebook profile. To her surprise, he accepted her friend request immediately and she was able to discover that he lived in Huntington Beach and attended Liberty Christian School.

Records show Gutierrez called the Huntington Beach Police Department at 12:22am July 17.

She told an officer about Matthew Cline's iFunny posting and emailed police screenshots of the post and his Facebook account.

Officers found the correct Matthew Cline on their database as well as his address and his father Bill Cline's cell phone number.

Hidden: Matthew Cline's suicide came as a shock to his family, who didn't know anything was amiss

According to the Courthouse News, a police report states that officers attempted to call William Cline two or three times.

The Clines say they never received any calls.

Approximately 20 hours after Gutierrez called the Huntingdon Beach Police Department, Matthew Cline committed suicide.

'Bottom line is he reached out for help and somebody did everything in her power to help,' Matthew's mother Kathy Cline told the Orange County Register.

'It was a failure by the adults. That's the saddest thing. A knock on the door and Matt would be alive. We could have got him help.'

According to Courthouse News, the claim states that officers responding to Matthew Cline's suicide 'immediately recognized' him as the teenager who made the iFunny post.

Matthew Cline's parents claim that an officer questioned Cline's sister about the post while they were out of earshot.

Their world: The Clines believe their son Matthew (seen here with his mother Kathy) would still be with them today if police had followed up on his social media post

The Orange County Register reports that the Clines' neighbor Kasha Buhman said the officer 'came up to [Matthew Cline's sister] Jackie and I stayed close by, because she was by herself and her parents weren't there,' Buhman said.

'He asked, â€˜Do you know if your brother ever went on an app called iFunny?' and asked if she had the password to his phone.'

The Clines had no idea their sporty son was troubled, and say that knowing about the iFunny post would have prevented their son's death.

'We just wanted a chance,' Bill Cline told the Orange County Register.

'He was our world.'

Lieutenant Mitchell O'Brien says there is no procedure for handling social media post such as Matthew Cline's.

'We get calls all the time and we follow up on what we can follow up on, but we can't follow up all the time,' O'Brien told the Orange County Register.

'We take threats of suicide very seriously â€¦ but it really comes down to, do we have a call for service and do we have a place to go? It's a judgment call.'

The Clines allege negligence, civil rights violations and are seeking damages for severe emotional distress and loss of companionship as well as expected loss of their son's future income.

According to the Courthouse News, the claim is seeking damages of more than $10,000. Claims of this nature are usually precursors to lawsuits.

The Clines are grateful to Ana Gutierrez for doing everything in her power to help their son, but Gutierrez herself struggles with what happened to the boy she tried to save.
