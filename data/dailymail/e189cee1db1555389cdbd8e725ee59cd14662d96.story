The boyfriend of a murdered mother-to-be has said she will always be 'the love of my life' as he struggles to come to terms with her brutal death nearly three years later.

Nikitta Grender, 19, was raped and then stabbed to death two weeks before she was due to give birth to a baby daughter.

Her boyfriend Ryan Morris has now spoken of the difficulties he has faced since his life was ripped apart by his older cousin Carl Whant who killed Miss Grender before setting fire to her flat, in Newport, South Wales.

Mr Morris said he was looking forward to becoming a father and settling down with Miss Grender before her brutal death

In a documentary to be aired tonight, Mr Morris says: 'She was the love of my life, she 
always will be now until the day I die, no matter which way I go in my 
life she will always be the love of my life.'

Speaking to MailOnline ahead of the documentary's screening Mr Morris, 20, said he was still 'suffering' after his life was drastically altered by Whant.

He said: 'I was in work, I was expecting to be a dad, I had the girl that I wanted and I had a great future.'

Mr Morris, who has not worked since the murder in February 2011, said he had been looking forward to settling down with Miss Grender.

He said: 'I would have married her. I set my eyes on her and she was what I wanted.

'Obviously with her having the baby and us moving in together, I thought that was the last step in that way and then we would have brought up the child. It was all taken away.'

Carl Whant was jailed for a minimum of 35 years in February 2012 for the murder of the teenager

Mr Morris said he is now on anti-depressants and has to take medication for his stomach which developed problems after he stopped eating and drank excessively in the months following Miss Grender's death.

Whant was jailed for a minimum of 35 years in February 2012 for the murder of the teenager.

The 6ft 3in 'vain and devious' killer stabbed Miss Grender to death, killing her unborn daughter at the same time.

He then set fire to her flat before returning to a party where he had been all night.

Mr Morris wept in the public gallery after the jury returned their verdict.

He had been forced to listen as Whant lied about the night of the double killing by falsely claiming Miss Grender, who he ‘fancied’, had willingly had sex with him.

In fact, he had gone to her house at 5am – drunk and high on cocaine – in the full knowledge that Mr Morris was not there. He raped her and stabbed her in the stomach and throat.

The court heard that the neck wound killed Miss Grender and the knife to her stomach killed her unborn child, who had already been named Kelsey-May.

In six police interviews Whant refused to answer every question about the killings.

He later falsely claimed to have taken part in a consensual threesome with Miss Grender and her boyfriend at the couple’s home on the day of the murder. But Mr Morris, 18, told the court: ‘Nothing like that happened. He’s a liar. I’m not into all that, I’d never do that, especially not with my cousin.’

Before the attack, Mr Morris, who had been out drinking with Whant on the night of the killings, had considered his second-cousin to be one of his closest friends and ‘like a brother’.

Mr Morris has now told MailOnline he has never been able to grieve properly because Whant has never admitted his crime.

He said: 'It makes it ten times worse. We will never be able to grieve because of what he put us through.

'He pleaded not guilty in court, he tried dragging me down with him and it makes me ten times worse now and it will have repercussions in the future because of what he said.

'That kind of stuff has stuck. I struggle to go to the supermarket because of what he's done to me. He has ruined my life.'

'I was in work, I was expecting to be a dad, I had the girl that I wanted and I had a great future'

- Ryan Morris

Mr Morris told MailOnline that in the months leading up to the murders, he would regularly talk to his cousin about the prospect of becoming a father.

He said: 'Obviously I spoke to him, in the months leading up to it I used to talk to Carl, I was expecting to be a dad and he had all that in his mind and for him still to do what he's done is sickening.'

Mr Morris said he has stayed in touch with Miss Grender's parents, Paul Brunnock and Marcia Grender, and sometimes sees them during his weekly visits to the cemetery.

He said: 'They have gone back into work full time but they are at the other end of the phone.

'I try to go up there to the cemetery twice a week, if not then it's guaranteed once a week.'

Mr Morris described his recovery as a 'learning curve', but said he has now stopped drinking and is hoping to return to work at some point in the next year.

He said: 'Things are starting, but I still sometimes don't eat all day, I have broken sleep, so it's not easy. I just take every day as it comes.'
