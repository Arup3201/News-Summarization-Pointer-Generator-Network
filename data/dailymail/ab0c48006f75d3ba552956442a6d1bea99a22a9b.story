More than a dozen CIA spies have reportedly been caught in Iran and Lebanon and the U.S. government now fears they have been executed.

The spies were paid informants who were targeting Iran - which is feared to be producing nuclear weapons - and the Hezbollah group in Beirut.

Their discovery is a big hindrance to U.S. attempts to track Iran’s nuclear activities and discover if Hezbollah is plotting any attacks against Israel.

‘Espionage is a risky business,’ a 
U.S. official told ABC News. ‘Many risks lead to wins but some result in
 occasional setbacks.’

Former
 senior CIA officer Robert Baer worked against Hezbollah in the 1980s 
and said the group will often execute those it believes to be spies.

‘If they were genuine spies, spying against Hezbollah, I don't think we'll ever see them again,’ Mr Baer told ABC News.

Other officials pointed out Hezbollah killed more Americans than any other terrorist organisation before the 9/11 attacks.

In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut.

Spying: The discovery damages U.S. attempts to track the activities of Iran and its president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right, and Hezbollah's Sheik Hassan Nasrallah

Some officials speaking to ABC News 
credited Iran and Hezbollah with their detection of spies, but others 
blamed sloppy CIA operations.

Hezbollah and Iran are among the CIA's toughest adversaries and have been improving their ability to hunt spies by relying on patience and guile to exploit holes.

The number of CIA agents in Iran and Lebanon countries is classified - but Iran claimed in May it arrested at least 30 people allegedly linked to a CIA-run spy network.

Hezbollah - backed by Iran - has built a professional counter-intelligence operation they proudly describe as the 'spy combat unit'.

But the U.S. has had no diplomatic presence in Iran for 30 years and this makes the CIA's job of finding out what is happening on the ground all the more important.

One case came when two Hezbollah agents pretended to work for the U.S. and the group found out where CIA officers were meeting with agents.

Two former officials told ABC News the CIA used the code-word ‘Pizza’ and the location was a Beirut Pizza Hut - but a current official denied this.

Hezbollah's longtime leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah boasted in June he had rooted out at least two CIA spies who had infiltrated his group’s ranks.

The damage to the Lebanon spy network has been greater than usual and the crisis is the latest mishap involving CIA counterintelligence.

Two years ago a suicide bomber posed as an informant and killed seven CIA employees and wounded six others in Afghanistan in December 2009.

'It all depends on who these guys were and what they have to say. Hezbollah has disappeared people before. Others they have kept around'

Matthew Levitt

The U.S. State Department last year described Hezbollah as ‘the most technically capable terrorist group in the world’.

Matthew Levitt, an intelligence expert and author at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies, said Hezbollah treats spies differently.

He said: ‘It all depends on who these guys were and what they have to say. Hezbollah has disappeared people before. Others they have kept around.’
