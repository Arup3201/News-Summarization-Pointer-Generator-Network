Stock markets have soared around the world over hopes that Europe has finally found a way out of its debt crisis.

Greece passed an unpopular property tax and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to offer the struggling country 'all necessary assistance' last night.

But it is unclear whether that will be enough to satisfy investors for long.

Stocks improved following last week's turmoil as speculation grew that Greece's bailout creditors would look to impose bigger losses on the country's private bondholders, as well as recapitalise Europe's banks and expand the eurozone's rescue fund.

Japan's Nikkei index rose 0.2 per cent to 8,625.40, while the Dow Jones rose 1.3 per cent to close at 11,190.69.

Britain's FTSE initially fell this morning, but had climbed another 1.3% by lunchtime after a 4 per cent rise last night.

So far, there has been no confirmation from Europe's capitals that such a comprehensive solution is being planned.

Financial markets closely watched the meeting between Ms Merkel and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, but neither announced any new measures ahead of their private dinner at Berlin's chancellery.

'Through the euro, we are closely bound together, and the weakness of one affects us all,' Ms Merkel said at a news conference.

Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is seen as a key player in resolving the 17-nation eurozone's debt crisis, but Ms Merkel's government has repeatedly been accused over the past 18 months of being a reluctant leader of the rescue efforts.

Speaking yesterday alongside economy minister Philip Roesler, Ms Merkel reiterated her conviction that there was no quick solution and the crisis must be dealt with 'step by step'.

Greece must receive a £7billion rescue loan before mid-October to stave off bankruptcy, a collapse that would send shock waves through markets around the world.

But creditors have demanded more efforts to raise revenue.

In response, Greek MPs approved a controversial new property tax last night, passing it 154-143 in the 300-member parliament.

The levy, in addition to public-sector reforms announced earlier, is expected to make up for lagging revenues this year by providing more than €billion, or about 1 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product.

Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos said his country would get the money.

'The disbursement will be decided in time, in line with the course of our funding needs,' he said.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told members of her own party that Greece might go bust before Christmas.

Ahead of today's crucial vote in the German parliament seeking to boost the bailout fund for Athens the country's biggest newspaper claims Ms Merkel told MPs of her conservative party:  'We are trying to avoid an insolvency of Greece. I cannot, however, exclude it.'

The paper questioned whether the kiss she gave to Greek premier Giorgos Papandreou when he arrived in Berlin yesterday begging for help was in fact a farewell smacker 'for Greece in the eurozone'.

No fresh details emerged after the pair dined together late last night, no silver bullet solution was offered to world markets, financiers, taxpayers and economists who have all been begging for leadership to end the crisis which has been dragging on now for 18 months.

Bild says it has information that numerous members of Ms Merkel's coalition government believe Greece will be bankrupt before Christmas. 

But a multi-billion euro top-up to the bailout fund to stave off disaster will likely be approved by lawmakers in Berlin tomorrow.

The vote, however, could prove to be the death knell for the German government. 

At least 11 members of Ms Merkel CDU and CSU conservative parties are threatening to revolt along with MPs in the Liberal FDP party which is the junior coalition party.

It means she relies on the support of the opposition to pass the measure and leaves her weakened, exposed and vulnerable to a leadership challenge. 

If Bild is correct in reporting her comments, the electorate will not take kindly to throwing more money at Greece when there is no guarantee it will have any effect at all.

Der Spiegel magazine says the size of her own parties' revolt against her tomorrow will determine her future.

It said: 'It would trigger opposition calls for her to step down or seek an early election.

'She would likely resist both options, but her scope to take bold new steps to contain the crisis with fresh German guarantees would be seriously curtailed.'

Tomorrow the Bundestag will vote on whether to increase the powers of the EFSF – the forerunner of the permanent rescue facility, the European Stability Mechanism, due to come into force in 2013.

Greeks have been outraged by tax and 
other austerity measures, and unions have responded with strikes and 
protests. Even as Mr Venizelos spoke, protesting ministry employees and 
tax office workers chanted outside his department in Athens.

Mr
Venizelos said Greece had made great efforts to achieve its fiscal 
targets, but that a 'hyper-effort' was necessary to fully meet its 
commitments.

He said 
representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the European 
Commission and the European Central Bank would return to Athens this 
week.

The so-called troika suspended its review in early September amid talk of missed targets and budget shortfalls.

The current plan is to have Greece implement painful debt-reduction measures in exchange for rescue loans.

Greece relies on funds from last year's €110billion (£95.5 billion) package, and European leaders also have agreed on a second €109billion bailout, although some details of that remain to be worked out.

'We want a strong Greece within the eurozone, and Germany is prepared to offer all necessary assistance,' Ms Merkel said in Berlin.

Mr Papandreou, in return, pledged to implement the reforms demanded by Greece's international creditors.

He said this was a time 'of great sacrifices for the Greek people. Therefore it is of great importance to receive signals of support from our European partners'.

Before the meeting between the two leaders, Ms Merkel's government downplayed speculation of bold new moves to tackle Europe's sprawling sovereign debt crisis.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble ruled out increasing the eurozone's new €440billion (£382bn) rescue fund, calling it 'a silly idea' that could ultimately endanger the AAA ratings of the main creditor countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.

Greece's new property tax will range from four to 20 euro for every square metre in residential properties. It will be charged through electricity bills to make it easier for the state to collect, instead of going through Greece's unwieldy and inefficient tax system.

Those who refuse to pay will risk having their power cut off.

The extra charge has deeply angered Greeks, who have already been through more than a year of sharp austerity measures, including salary and pension cuts and higher taxes.

State electricity company unionists have threatened not to collect the tax. Public transport workers walked off the job for two days yesterday, and were to be joined by taxi drivers today.

Tax office and customs workers were also on strike.

Police briefly scuffled with protesters outside parliament shortly after yesterday's vote and used pepper spray to disperse one group of youths.
