Mario Balotelli’s future at Liverpool remains in grave doubt after it emerged manager Brendan Rodgers has increasing reservations about his technical ability.

Balotelli has endured a difficult start to his career at Anfield and is yet to score a goal in the Barclays Premier League club this season.

Doubts have existed about the Italy forward's attitude, hunger and desire ever since he first played in England for Manchester City three years ago and his performances for Liverpool have done nothing to persuade his critics otherwise.

But now it has emerged that Rodgers is beginning to have more fundamental issues with Balotelli after admitting privately that he has concerns about whether the striker is good enough to lead his attack.

Liverpool won 3-1 at Bournemouth without Balotelli on Wednesday in the Capital One Cup and went into last Sunday’s game at Manchester United – that they lost 3-0 – without a recognised centre forward in the team.

With young winger Raheem Sterling scoring twice at Bournemouth and finding himself in a host of scoring positions during the game at United, it would appear Balotelli is close to becoming surplus to requirements at Anfield.

The Italian did look sharper after coming on as a substitute at United last Sunday and was perhaps unlucky to find home goalkeeper David de Gea in such good form.

Nevertheless, Rodgers hopes to welcome main striker Daniel Sturridge back to fitness in the new year and also has Rickie Lambert to consider. Lambert has also had his own problems since joining Liverpool but has been used a little more by Rodgers in recent games.

Recently, Rodgers admitted that the decision to buy Balotelli towards the back end of the summer transfer window had been a gamble.

He said: 'I felt it was a risk we needed to take with Mario because, as a group, we couldn’t afford not to at that time.

'It was obviously late on and we needed to have someone in. It’s something that we can’t regret now. I made it clear at the beginning it was a calculated risk - and that is why he probably cost the money he did.'

Liverpool have previously denied suggestions that they will try to sell Balotelli in the January transfer window.
