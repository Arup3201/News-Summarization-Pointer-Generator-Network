Gary Haynes, a high school football player from Texas, was caught on video throwing a 40-yard-pass and then catching it himself. Here he is about to throw the ball

As soo nas he throws the ball, Haynes is off and running. He says he was inspired to do the feat after seeing a player on the Kansas City Chiefs do it

The football can be seen above Haynes' head as he runs to catch it. Haynes said his dream is to play for the Houston Texans

Haynes manages to catch the ball about five seconds after he threw it. His football coach didn't believe he was able to throw and catch his own pass, so Haynes replicated the feat in front of him

Haynes said he was inspired to attempt the feat after seeing a video of Kansas City Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles (pictured) doing the same thing

It has been shared more than 46,600 times on Vine.

'I can't believe it,' the high school junior told KPRC. 'My whole life changed in less than five seconds.'

He said he got the idea after watching a video of Kansas City Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles doing the same pass and throw.

Haynes has received a lot of media attention over his athletic accomplishment. The video has even been shown on NBC's 'The Today Show' and 'CBS This Morning'

Some people, including Haynes' head coach, Kirk Martin, initially didn't believe him. So Martin had Haynes do it again, which he did, as Martin recorded.

'My initial reaction was that's not real,' Martin said. 'If anyone can do it, Gary Haynes can. Because he has a great arm and he can run.'

The video has become so popular, it was even shown on NBC's 'The Today Show' and 'CBS This Morning'

'I wasn't expecting it to go viral like that,' Haynes said. 'I just expected my friends to see it and that would be all, but then people started contacting me left and right on Twitter and Instagram.'

Haynes said his dream is to play in the NFL with the Houston Texas.

'I want to get faster,' Haynes said. 'To be in the NFL, to play college football, you have to have speed and that is what I'm trying to go for.'

Haynes says his dream would be to one day play for the Houston Texans.

The University of Houston and a few other colleges have already shown interest in him.
