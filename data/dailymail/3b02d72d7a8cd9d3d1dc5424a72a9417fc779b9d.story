Labour's attacks on increasing privatisation in the NHS were undermined yesterday when a Blairite former health minister said the move is ‘sensible’.

Lord Warner said his party had expanded the use of private providers in health care – which could not survive without them now.

Insisting the independent sector was now ‘embedded’ in the NHS, he also warned that tough restrictions planned by shadow health secretary Andy Burnham may be illegal under EU competition rules.

His comments come after Mr Burnham yesterday claimed that the NHS would be sunk by ‘a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation’ under the Tories, while Labour leader Ed Miliband said the service would be gone within five years under Conservative management.

But Tory MPs accuse the party of hypocrisy, saying expenditure on NHS services provided free by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the preceding four years under Labour.

Yesterday Lord Warner, a health minister under Tony Blair between 2003 and 2007, waded into the debate – insisting Blairite reforms had stopped the scandal of repeated operation cancellations because surgeons were concentrating on emergencies.

Saying independent sector treatment centres ‘changed the dynamic’, he added: ‘I’m not a mad privatising Right-wing member of the Labour Party – it was about challenging the NHS and the way it works. I feel that public monopolies need some kind of challenge.

An extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland will be funded by a mansion tax on valuable homes in the South East of England, Labour’s Scottish leader said yesterday.

Jim Murphy said the controversial levy would send £250million a year north of the border – even though just 0.3 per cent of the revenue will be raised there.

He said it enabled him to make a ‘uniquely Labour pledge’ to increase spending on the Scottish NHS without having to increase taxes on Scots. He added: ‘As much as 95 per cent of the mansion tax will be levied in the South East of the UK but its benefit will be felt across the UK.

‘There is a choice about what we would do with that money raised outside of Scotland and how we spend it in Scotland.’

The proposed tax will target properties valued at more than £2million, despite criticism – even from inside Labour – that London and the South East will bear the brunt. Scotland will also be handed a disproportionate share of the takings under the controversial Barnett Formula.

Former Labour Cabinet minister Charles Clarke yesterday called the idea an ‘absurd proposition’, while Tory MP Dominic Raab said Labour was ‘selling out the English’.

Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: ‘Every voter in London should read Labour’s proposal for a homes tax in London to pay for the NHS in Scotland.’

‘I’m simply saying that what we did under Blair in bringing in competition was to challenge the NHS – it remains a sensible policy.’

Lord Warner insisted Labour would have to take EU rules into account before embarking on plans to restrict the freedom of NHS providers to commission services from private providers.

‘The truth of the matter is that the private sector has not chosen to make any challenge under that, but they could do – and any Health Secretary would have to deal with it.’

The former minister also insisted that wider competition also helped with the ‘peaks and troughs’ of demand, especially in winter. ‘No one has been able to iron these peaks and troughs at any time since the time of Nye Bevan,’ he added.

The NHS Confederation, which represents hospital trusts, agreed that the private sector could continue to play a role.

Deputy director of policy Elizabeth Wade said was ‘vital’ that health bosses should be free to commission independent sector providers where they believe they offer the best service and value.John Appleby, of health think-tank the King’s Fund, said Mr Burnham should focus on securing quality for patients and value for the taxpayer.

‘This slight obsession about the private sector seems to be misplaced,’ he said.

Labour has made the NHS central to its election campaign, issuing a poster claiming the health service ‘as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron’.

Mr Burnham yesterday denied that Labour was scaremongering, claiming that the character of the NHS would be ‘changed beyond recognition’ if there was more private sector involvement. ‘I believe we [Labour] let the market in too far and it’s my view that if you carry on with this experimentation with the market in the National Health Service, you will in the end destroy everything that is precious about it.’

Oover the next four months, voters will be bombarded with warnings of how the Tories ‘want to cut spending on public services to the levels of the 1930s, when there was no NHS’.

The line was peddled by Ed Miliband and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham yesterday and was also the focus of the party’s first – highly negative – campaign poster.

However, the statement is at best deeply disingenuous.

It is true that the plans unveiled in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement would cut public expenditure as a percentage of national income, or GDP, to 35 per cent by 2020.

And, as an overall share of GDP, this would be the ‘lowest level since the late-1930s’, as the Office for Budget Responsibility acknowledges.

But Labour did not include the ‘share of GDP’ caveat, which is crucial.

In real terms, the amount of money which is actually spent on the public sector, when inflation is factored in – will be reduced only to its lowest level since 2002/03.

In other words, Labour is pretending that returning to the level of spending that took place during the second term Blair-Brown Government would inflict devastation upon the Health Service.

Plainly, this is nonsense and does nothing to support Labour’s emotive claim that ‘the NHS as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron’.

Indeed, it is the health service where the cuts will have least impact. Along with international aid, the NHS budget is ring-fenced – and Mr Osborne has found an extra £2billion to further fill its coffers.

By comparison, defence, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the communities department have seen their unprotected budgets slashed.

The irony is that, when the Tories unveiled their much-ridiculed poster urging voters to stay on the ‘road to economic recovery’ last week, Labour screamed blue murder at David Cameron’s claim that the ‘deficit had been halved’ – which was itself true only as a proportion of GDP, not in cash terms.

They are now guilty of the same crime themselves.

At least the Tories were trying to deliver a positive message when they were caught out. For Mr Miliband and Mr Burnham, the sole intention was scaremongering. Regrettably, there’ll be plenty more to come.
