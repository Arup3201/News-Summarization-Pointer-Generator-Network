A body found in a car recovered from a Florida river has been confirmed as that of missing teacher Lisa Hayden-Gordon, 51

Police have confirmed that a body found inside a car recovered from a Florida river is that of a missing piano teacher.

Lisa Hayden-Gordon, 51, vanished on January 24 following a night out watching a concert with friends.  

Her body was recovered from a vehicle found submerged in the New River near Cooley's Landing Marina in Fort Lauderdale on Friday.

It was a distinctive blue 2003 Hyundai Elantra that was decorated with stickers of the sun, moon and stars on its hood.

Hayden-Gordon had gone out with a man she met online and several of her friends, and they attended a Keller Williams show at Revolution Live in Fort Lauderdale.

The group  wanted to take her home because they thought she had had too much to drink, but she went to the restroom at a bar, the Poorhouse, and never returned.

They looked for her but when they could not find her anywhere, they ended up leaving. 

A friend told CBS that people had seen Hayden  walking away from a bar with her keys in her hand the night she went missing.

'Everybody who saw her that night said that she was so happy and having just a good time,' her sister Tara Cloe previously told the Sun Sentinel. 'She's always singing, she was probably singing the whole time during the concert. And then she left.'

Missed: Hayden-Gordon was known as 'Noodle' to her friends and students. Witnesses said they saw her walking away from a concert with her car keys

Friends had made tearful pleas for information about the woman they called 'Noodles', a nickname that stuck after she became addicted to the food while in hospital recovering from a car accident as a child.

'My sister would never leave us. And she's the most loving, outgoing, friendly person,' Susan O'Leary told the Sun Sentinel earlier.

'For her not to be here, be a part of our lives, I don't even know how to tell you what kinds of emotions you could have. We don't know what to do, where else to go, where else to turn.' 

Police said they are still investigating the cause of Ms Hayden-Gordon's death, according to Local10.com.
