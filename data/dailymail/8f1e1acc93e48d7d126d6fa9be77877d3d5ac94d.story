Freezeframe Instant Lash: Scientists in Australia have invented 'instant lash extensions' which double the length of eyelashes in seconds, they claim

They are the must-have make-up accessory of WAGS and young women everywhere.

But for those who yearn for long, luscious eye-lashes, without the hassle of applying false ones, a new mascara may be about to revolutionise eye make-up for ever.

Scientists in Australia have come up with a treatment which claims to double the length of eye-lashes in seconds.

Made up of a combination of tiny 
synthetic hairs, contained in a thick gel base, users brush on 
Freezeframe Instant Lash with a mascara wand, depositing the small hairs
on to the tips of their eye-lashes.

The
more times the treatment is applied, the more hairs are deposited, 
giving the wearer natural looking lash extensions up to a third of an 
inch longer.

The gel base 
holds the tiny hairs in place, but can also help stiffen lashes, so they
can be ‘curled up’, giving the wearer a pretty ‘open-eyed’ look.      

Unlike traditional mascara, Instant Lash is applied to just the tips of lashes, not from the base.

Users are able to apply their usual coloured mascara on top.

It can be used by contact lens’ wearers and is removed like other eye products, with cleanser or soap and water.

Instant
Lash has become the number one selling lash product in Australia and 
there is already a 7,000-strong waiting list for the 10ml bottles when 
it goes on sale on the British High Street for the first time next 
month.

Skin care expert, Sonia Amoroso, who developed the £29 formula, said: ‘It is my personal passion to make the most cutting edge, scientific breakthroughs in easy to use formulations, at accessible prices.     

‘Freezeframe Instant Lash has been a huge hit with customers who say this lash treatment creates visibly instant, longer, luscious lashes in seconds.’

Tricky business: Applying false eyelashes is a tricky business. The new product, which looks like mascara, has become the number-one selling eyelash product in Australia

One customer, Sylvia Brown, 60, of Nottingham, said she started using Instant Lash because her eye-lashes were getting ‘sparser’ as she got older.

‘I’m not a fan of fake eyelashes and couldn’t bear the thought of going to a salon for extensions,’ she said.

‘ I read rave reviews about Instant Lash on the Internet and thought I’d buy some.  

'The product is amazing and leaves me looking like I have thicker, longer lashes instantly, I’d recommend it to anyone.’

Another user, Jennifer Lynn, 32, from Brighton,  added: ‘Instant Lash is my party must have, no longer do I have to wear fake lashes, I apply and instantly have longer, thicker lashes, it’s amazing.’

Instant Lash goes on sale at Boots in store and online on February 6.
