Protesters in Tehran yesterday chanted 'Death to the dictator' in a fierce stand against President Ahmadinejad.

The rare public outpouring of anger against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad followed strikes by currency traders and bazaar merchants over the financial crisis in Iran.

Today, the streets were filled with riot police as the government showed it was determined not to allow another day of violence.

It was a complete contrast to yesterday's scenes, which saw banks and public buildings vandalised amid clashes with police as protestors blamed their president for the country's economic decay.

'Shame on you, Mahmoud - leave politics!' the activists screamed, according to onlookers.

But most shops in Tehran's main bazaar were reopened today, the first day of the Iranian weekend, and no unrest was reported.

The
plunging value of the rial has prompted questions over Iran's economic 
health in the face of tightening international sanctions over 
Ahmadinejad's nuclear programme.

His detractors claim that this, allied with populist redistributive policies, has left the country in financial turmoil.

Iran's rial has lost nearly 40 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar in the past week. The rate Thursday - about 32,000 rials for the dollar - was a bit higher than the record low earlier this week.

Defence: Ahmadinejad, pictured at a press conference on Tuesday, blamed the drop in Iran's currency on 'psychological pressures' linked to Western sanctions over his nuclear programme

At a press conference on Tuesday, 
Ahmadinejad blamed the drop in Iran's currency on 'psychological 
pressures' linked to the Western sanctions.

yesterday, police
sprayed teargas at the protesters, who set rubbish bins on fire in a 
district close to foreign exchange shops and the city's main bazaar.

They threatened merchants who closed their shops and launched crackdowns on sidewalk money changers as part of the push to halt the chaos.

One of the many merchants standing beside their closed shops added: 'There is no business - whether shops are open or closed.'

A
shoe shop owner said he had lost two-thirds of his capital because of 
the falling currency and had had to let 70 workers at his factory go.

The
US has tightened banking sanctions and the EU has banned oil imports 
from Iran after concerns over its nuclear development programme.

The
Islamic regime denies that it is planning to make weapons and insists 
it continues to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes only.

Critics: Some claim the protests near Tehran's main bazaar were sparked by politicians who oppose Ahmadinejad's regime, with the presidential elections just ahead in June

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that Iran's leaders deserve responsibility for the economic problems.

'They have made their own government decisions, having nothing to do with the sanctions, that have had an impact on the economic conditions inside the country,' she said, adding that the effect of the sanctions could be quickly remedied if the Iranian government were willing to work with the international community 'in a sincere manner.'

Some
Iranians believe the strike and protests were not spontaneous but 
masterminded by conservative politicians and businessmen who oppose 
Ahmadinejad.

Inflation in 
Iran is now at least 23.5 per cent and youth unemployment has reached 
28.6 per cent - both gross underestimates, according to the country's 
economists.

The dramatic power struggle comes ahead of the presidential elections, which take place in June.
