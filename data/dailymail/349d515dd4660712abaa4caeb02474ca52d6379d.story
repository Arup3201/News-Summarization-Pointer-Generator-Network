The body of a 28-year-old man who disappeared after a night out clubbing with friends has been found. 

Patrick Lamb went missing during the early hours of December 13 after a night out in Bar Chocolate in Maidstone, Kent.  

His father Tony Lamb, 65, confirmed last night that the body pulled from the River Medway at Cuxton Marina, near Rochester, was that of his son.

Mr Lamb said police had retrieved Pat's phone and wallet and the family would be issuing a statement tomorrow. 

The heartbreaking news brings to an end the month-long search for Mr Lamb.

She wrote: 'My heart truly aches as I have to write this but last night our worlds came crashing down when we finally got our answers for Pat.

'My amazingly kind hearted, talented and selfless brother unfortunately passed away in the early hours of Saturday 13th December.

'I would never be able to put into words how hard this past month has been and for every day that I rung Patrick's phone I wish I heard his voice answer telling me he was safe.

'Patrick was truly the most amazing brother a little sister could ask for and I know he will continue to look out for me. Sleep tight Pat, love you.' 

The Pat Lamb Search Team posted on its Facebook page last night: 'It is now been confirmed that Patricks Body has been identified as the body found at Cuxton. As a Team we are heartbroken and send our condolences to the Family and Tasha...'

The family and friends of Mr Lamb, of Greenhithe, in Kent, had earlier recreated his last known movements on video.

It showed the route taken he took up until 12.20pm on December 13, after he left Bar Chocolate sometime after 11pm.

CCTV images captured a number of sightings of Mr Lamb, a broadcast engineer.

He was last seen on Fairmeadow and had booked into a hotel in St Michael's Road but did not return.

A post on a Facebook campaign set up to help find him had said it was hoped the video would jog peoples' memories.

Days before Christmas, Mr Lamb's girlfriend Natasha Morgan, 28, released an emotional minute-long video urging him to come home. 

She said: 'Pat, if you're listening, I love you so much. Please come home to me.'  

Mr Lamb's father, mother Sharon, 57, sister Zoe, 20, and his four brothers had also put up posters around Kent and launched a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #findpatlamb.
