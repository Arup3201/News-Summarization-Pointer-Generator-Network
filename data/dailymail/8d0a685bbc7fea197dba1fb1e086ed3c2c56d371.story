A Tennessee man has been arrested and charged with killing a woman, dismembering her body and devouring parts of her corpse.

Coffee County District Attorney Mickey Layne says 37-year-old Gregory Hale was apprehended at his home late Sunday on charges of premeditated first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse.

Layne says a neighbor told police he'd had a conversation with Hale and had reason to believe a homicide had been committed.

'Cannibal': Gregory Hale, 37, has been charged with murder and abuse of corpse after police say he killed a woman, chopped up her body and ate parts of the corpse

When officers arrived at the home, Layne says they found human remains on the grounds. They then questioned Hale and took him into custody.

The victim has been identified as 36-year-old Lisa Hyder, from Dekalb County. 

'We are very early in the investigation,' said Assistant District Attorney Marla Holloway. 'The officers were out late last night into the early hours of the morning gathering information.'

Layne says Hale has an attorney and is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. His next court date is June 23. 

Detectives believe the gruesome murder took place inside Hale's rural home on Pete Sain Road in Manchester on or around Friday.

According to Hale's arrest affidavit, the suspect admitted to killing Lisa Hyder and then disposing of her body by beheading the victim and chopping off her hands and feet.

Officers who responded to Hale's residence after receiving a tip found at least two plastic buckets filled with human remains.

Hale buried the victim's torso in a burn pile on his property and consumed a part of the corpse, the document stated. 

Following his arrest, Hale told police he and Hyder did not know each other until they met in Manchester and went to the man's home, Times Free Press reported. 

The two were sitting around the fire and talking when the 37-year-old allegedly attacked and killed Hyder.

Gregory Hale offered investigators no motive for the brutal slaying and subsequent cannibalism.

A friend of Hale's told the station WSMV the 37-year-old was a self-described devil worshiper who was fired from a slaughterhouse after the owner caught him performing a satanic ritual with animal parts.
