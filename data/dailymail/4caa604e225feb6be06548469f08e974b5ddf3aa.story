As the Brazil stars get themselves into shape ahead of the World Cup, Lucas Leiva has been enjoying his summer holidays... by practising his lassoing skills.

The Liverpool midfielder, who was left out of Luis Felipe Scolari's squad Brazil squad for the World Cup, posted a video of himself on Instagram riding on horseback and lassoing a cow.

Leiva, 27, was surprisingly adept at lassoing as he successfully wrapped the rope around the animal at the first attempt.
