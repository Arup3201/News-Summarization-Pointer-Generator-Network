What do you get for the prince who has everything?

Another royal title? A personalised numberplate? Or a mini-dinghy, just big enough to take a toddler on a solo voyage out to sea?

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were presented with a miniature boat for baby George during their tour of New Zealand today... and looked somewhat puzzled when it was unveiled.

Um... thanks? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked somewhat puzzled when the Sealegs mini-dinghy was unveiled

Big gift: It was a gift from marine technology firm Sealegs, after it ferried the royal couple to Westpark Marina, Auckland, New Zealand, today

Still, the couple graciously accepted the offering on their son's behalf, while he rested at home.

Wrapped in a giant red bow, it was a gift from marine technology firm Sealegs, after it ferried the royal couple to Westpark Marina, Auckland, New Zealand, today.

'It is a privilege and an honour to have the opportunity to present this bespoke mini-Sealegs for Prince George as a momento of his visit to New Zealand,' said Eric Series, Sealegs Chairman. 'We hope he has some magic and memorable moments while playing in his Sealegs both in and out of the water.'

Playing along: Baby George was not present to receive the gift, instead staying at home where he was later joined by his parents

The couple were in Auckland to visit the home of New Zealand’s America’s Cup team where they were invited to take the helm of their two yachts, and race around a series of buoys.

The Duchess, wearing a white Breton-style striped top by Me + Em, skinny navy jeans, deck shoes and a baseball cap, with her hair in a ponytail, was out for revenge after the Duke beat her in a dragon boat race the last time they competed on the water, in Canada in 2011.

Earlier the couple had laughed and joked as they boarded another luxury boat, Imagine, where they changed out of their civvies into sailing gear.

All smiles: The royal couple are in Auckland with baby George as part of a three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia

It was dress down Friday for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they arrived in Auckland for a day of engagements Friday morning.

The couple began by visiting families at the largest RNZAF base in New Zealand at Whenuapai, home to more than a thousand serving airmen and women.

The meeting was a chance for the couple to greet staff and their families and thank them for their service. Many have recently served on operations overseas.

On Saturday William will visit Pacific Aerospace, while Kate will visit Rainbow Place Children’s Hospice.

The Royal couple will fittingly open the Cambridge velodrome in Hamilton and visit Cambridge War Memorial.
