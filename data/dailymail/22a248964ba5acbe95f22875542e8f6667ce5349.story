The pair have been caught in an international backlash following the suspected suicide of Mrs Saldanha on Friday morning.

While
it is not thought the presenters broke any laws, it is expected they will 
be interviewed by police. Scotland Yard is preparing a report for Mrs 
Saldanha’s inquest and requires statements from them.

Speaking to The Sun, Nick Kaldas, 
deputy commissioner for New South Wales said: 'If you're going to 
prepare a coroner's brief you will need to look at all aspects of it.

'There's this question of what was said and done.'

The boss of the radio company at the 
centre of the royal hoax call yesterday refused to sack the DJs behind the 
stunt and painted them as victims.

The 2DayFM
presenters were both taken off air after the death of Mrs Saldanha emerged.

The 46-year-old mother of two, had been manning the hospital 
switchboard when the Australian hoaxers called and she transferred the 
call to the Duchess of Cambridge's ward.

Rhys Holleran, the chief executive of
Southern Cross Austereo, which owns the station, said the presenters 
were 'completely shattered' and had been offered counselling.

His
comments were made before King Edward VII hospital said they had sent a
letter of complaint to the company about the 'truly appalling' prank.

Lord Glenarthur, chairman of the hospital, said that he wanted to 'protest' against the prank and seek assurances that the station would never do anything similar again.

Mr Holleran told a press conference in Melbourne that the primary concern was for the family of Jacintha Saldanha, whose body was found yards from the King Edward VII Hospital.

He said: 'I spoke to both presenters early this morning and it's fair to say they are completely shattered.

'These people aren't machines, 
they're human beings. What happened is incredibly tragic and we’re 
deeply saddened and we’re incredibly affected by that.’

He added: 'I think prank calls as a 
craft in radio have been going for decades and decades and are not just 
part of one radio station or network or country.

'No-one could have reasonably foreseen what ended up being an incredibly tragic day.'

Mr Holleran declined to reveal who had dreamed up the prank call but said: ‘These things are often done collaboratively.'

A source confirmed that 2DayFM’s lawyers had listened to audio of the entire call and had given it 
clearance to go to air.

Mr Holleran said it was ‘a bit early’ to be drawing conclusions from what was really a ‘deeply tragic matter.’

He added: ‘I don’t think anyone could have reasonably foreseen that this was going to be a result.'

The grieving husband of nurse 
Mrs Saldanha has told of 
his devastation at her death.

Benedict Barboza, a 49-year-old hospital accountant, also known as Ben, posted a tribute to Mrs Saldanha on his Facebook page.

He wrote: 'I am devastated with the 
tragic loss of my beloved wife Jacintha in tragic circumstances, She 
will be laid to rest in Shirva, India.'

Mrs Saldanha found herself at the 
centre of the controversy after answering the DJs' call, when they 
obtained intimate details about Kate Middleton's condition by posing as 
the Queen and Prince Charles.

The grieving family of the 'excellent' nurse said:  'We as a 
family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved Jacintha.'
