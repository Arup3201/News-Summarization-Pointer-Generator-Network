Liam Fox: The loyal supporter of David Cameron may return to quash any dissent as tensions in the party bubble over

Liam Fox is being lined up for a Cabinet return to help crush three fledgling plots against David Cameron’s leadership.

Senior allies of the Prime Minister say he is considering making the former defence secretary chief whip to get a grip on his backbenchers as rebellion spreads even further than first thought.

The Mail can reveal that Tory whips believe they have uncovered two more plots against Mr Cameron after allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie were exposed last week for promoting him as the next Tory leader.

The second plot involves a former Army officer who has attempted to recruit supporters from among MPs who used to serve in the Armed Forces for what the leadership has branded a ‘military coup’ against the Prime Minister.

At least one minister and several Parliamentary Private Secretaries have been approached with a view to joining the conspiracy - though party managers believe most have said no.

Separately ministers ousted in Mr Cameron’s last reshuffle and those who have never been given a job have also privately discussed whether to act against him.

This third ‘plot’ has not yet reached ‘lift-off’ according to MPs in the know. But whips are monitoring this group of the ‘disgruntled and the dispossessed’.

Insiders say none of these three plots yet has the momentum to oust the PM, but concede the three groups of plotters are ‘somewhat interlocking’ and reflect ‘widespread dissatisfaction’ with Mr Cameron’s leadership.

Treasury minister Greg Clark today dismissed rumours of an imminent leadership challenge as 'a load of rubbish.

'I’ve neither been approached or asked to join anyone’s team. We’ve got a very good leader of the party,' he told BBC radio 4.

Current Chief Whip Sir George Young called in Mr Afriyie for a dressing down last Thursday after he was named as the central figure in a plot to oust Mr Cameron.

But some of Mr Cameron’s closest aides now want Dr Fox to return as chief whip in a move that would be popular with the Tory Right and give him the authority to act against the plotters.

Insiders say he has served his time after quitting over his friendship with lobbyist Adam Werritty and remained loyal.

He was a staunch supporter of Mr Cameron’s recent speech on Europe and has remained close to Chancellor George Osborne and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

Sir George was ushered into retirement last autumn but recalled after Andrew Mitchell’s resignation one month into the job.

The ‘military coup’ plotters have privately discussed their options but unlike Mr Afriyie’s supporters - dubbed the Windsor Set after his constituency - they have not identified a potential leader.

Tory chiefs believe Mr Afriyie, who has campaigned to scrap the expenses watchdog IPSA, has primarily won support from MPs who were publicly humiliated over their second homes allowance claims.

Those named in connection with one or other of the plots include Mark Field, Bill Wiggin - an Eton contemporary of Mr Cameron - Chris Heaton-Harris, Jonathan Djanogly, Dan Byles and Patrick Mercer, a former Army Colonel.

Mr Mercer denies any involvement in plots but is widely reported to have sent a letter to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee calling for a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron.

A vote would be triggered if Mr Brady receives 46 letters.

Mr Wiggin, who is an ally of Mr Afriyie, was ousted from the whips office in Mr Cameron’s reshuffle and also served as a Territorial Army platoon commander with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, is seen by party chiefs as the link man between the three groups.

He also faced embarrassment over expenses when he was forced to repay £4,000 claimed on the wrong property.

Mr Wiggin, who was a year above Mr Cameron at Eton and whose wife Milly used to date the PM, has denied seeking to oust him but has publicly voiced his admiration for Mr Afriyie’s leadership potential.

Yesterday he told a Sunday newspaper: ‘It’s got nothing to do with me.’
