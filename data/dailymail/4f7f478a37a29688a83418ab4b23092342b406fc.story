Google has released a new online tool in the UK that will mean that anyone can become a ‘citizen cartographer’.

The Google Map Maker will allow people to add detailed local knowledge to Google Maps in the UK.

It will enable people to contribute and edit map data as well as drawing and labelling local maps.

It is hoped that the product will mean that users can improve the quality of maps using their local knowledge of features such as footpaths, forests, parks, and golf courses, as these features have traditionally been less well mapped.

It will also mean that people can add relevant information that has previously not been present, such as the location of post offices, agricultural details, camping sites, barbeque areas, new bus stations, and even drinking water fountains

Google hopes that the Map Maker will enable people to quickly transform a simple map into a more detailed and accurate representation of a city’s local treasures and that it will make the maps of the UK more comprehensive and accurate than ever before.

When someone logs in to use the programme they are presented with an interface that allow them to add places, roads, rivers and railways, building outlines or natural features.

Click through options then allow extra detail about features to be added.

Once someone has added to a map the improvement has to be approved before it appears across Google Maps, Google Earth, and Google Maps for Mobile.

London¿s Bletchley Park was the first place in the UK to have contributions made by people using the programme (the image shows the map of the area before their contributions were added)

The contributions will be reviewed by fellow users, regional experts and a team of Google reviews who will look for duplications and potential spam.

Google is launching Map Maker with a workshop at London’s Bletchley Park today – this was the first place in the UK to have contributions made by people using the programme.

Google’s ‘citizen cartographer’ has been released in the UK at a time when it is known that both Apple and Nokia are investing in rival free mapping programmes.

It was first released in about 15 countries in 2008, it was then extended to much of the rest of the world but because of ‘technical obstacles’ the company has only just been able to bring the technology to the UK.
