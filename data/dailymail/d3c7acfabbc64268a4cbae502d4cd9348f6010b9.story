Tips on how to make tea or coffee and fry bacon are among the recipes in a cookbook for WWI soldiers that has been published for the first time in 100 years. 

Hundreds of thousands of young men who had never been near an oven or kettle in their lives were given the guide when they headed off to war in 1914. 

But the British Army Cook Book didn't just show how to cook simpler items, it also provided tips on how to stretch the meagre wartime rations into meals like beef curry and toad-in-the-hole for an entire platoon.  

Young soldiers were armed with the British Army Cook Book on their way to war. Recipes showed how to stretch meagre wartime rations into proper meals. Many men had never cooked before in their lives. In the left picture, a group of WW1 soldiers are given a desert cookery lesson. In the right picture, a WW1 soldier cooks his evening meal 

Each soldier was allowed 10 ounces of meat and eight ounces of vegetables a day and frontline 'chefs' were expected to provide tasty and nutritious meal with these small amounts.

Recipe suggestions in the book include  roast meat and Yorkshire puddings, Irish stew, meat pie, Turkish pilau and various soups.

There is even a section dedicated to deserts with entries like jam rolls, bread and butter pudding and treacle tarts.

The dishes might sound tempting but in reality those on the frontlines would have had to rely more on powdered foods because fresh produce often took too long to reach them.

 The cookbook was first launched in 1910, four years before war against Germany broke out 

Like an idiots' guide to cooking, the book instructed soldiers how to make coffee and tea in war zones and explains the various ways of cooking food, from roasting to frying 

The cookbook included a guide to the various vegetables sent to troops, with instructions on how to prepare them and what to serve them with.

It notes 'carrots should always be sent up to table with boiled beef' and suggests boiling onions so that they are 'deprived of much of their pungent, volatile oil'.

It was produced by the Army School of Cookery, which had been set up in Aldershot, Hants, in 1885.

Those stationed on the Front Line received an allowance of 4,193 calories daily, while those further back in the lines of communication were allocated 3,472 calories per day

The 1914 British Army Cook Book has been printed by Amberley Publishing for the first time since it was first issued 100 years ago.

It is on sale now for £9.99.

Hazel Cochrane, from Amberley, said: 'The original manuscript dates from 1910 and was published by the British War Office prior to the war, following the establishment of the Army School of Cookery in Aldershot in 1885.

'This may have been as a consequence of changing attitudes to soldiers' diets nearing the end of the nineteenth century.

'There was an increasing recognition that a well-fed solider was a long-term investment that produced better results on the battlefield.'

She continued: 'Changes to soldiers' diets included an increase in the allowance of fresh meat and bread that was allocated to soldiers at the beginning of the century

'It was an attitude reflected in the meat stew recipes and tips on producing fresh bread.

'The cookery school was represented by soldiers taken from around the country, who were trained to make the best of the uncompromising conditions of the battlefield.

Biscuit Pudding:

Ingredients for 60 men: 10lbs biscuit crumbs, 4lbs flour, 3lbs sugar, 3lbs suet, 41 tablespoons lemon or lime juice, pinch of salt

 Method: Thoroughly dry the biscuits, then crush with a rolling pin. 

Soak in cold water for about 15 minutes. 

 Remove all skin from the suet, then chop very fine. 

Add the flour, sugar, salt and lime juice to the soaked biscuits. 

Stir well together with sufficient water to make a stiff paste. 

Grease some basins and boil or bake until done. 

Time allowed for cooking depends on the size of the pudding.

 

Fried bacon:

Cut the bacon into thin slices, trim away the rusty part and cut off the rind. 

Put into a cold frying pan, that is to say, do not place the pan on the fire before the bacon is in it.

Turn it two or three times and dish it on a very hot dish, poach some eggs and slip them on to the bacon without breaking the yolk and serve quickly.

'This included how best to keep fires alight through the incessant wind and rain of war as making tea and coffee in adverse weather conditions was not an easy feat.

'There was a heavy reliance on meat and bread in the British Army and meals were not varied, with vegetables often consisting of just potatoes.

'Despite the promise of fresh meat and bread that the changes proposed, a soldier's diet may have varied depending on where they were stationed.'

Each soldier was allowed 10 ounces of meat and eight ounces of vegetables a day and frontline 'chefs' were expected to provide tasty and nutritious meal with these small amounts 

The cookbook included a guide to the various vegetables sent to troops, with instructions on how to prepare them and what to serve them with 

She continued: 'It is certainly true that a better diet was possible away from the front line, where foraging through the French countryside was possible, but those on the front line did receive the most amount of food.

'Those stationed on the Front Line received an allowance of 4,193 calories daily, while those further back in the lines of communication were allocated 3,472 calories per day.

'The recipes in the book focus on making the most of what soldiers had, something relevant to modern-day families feeling the pinch of the recent recession.

'Something can be learnt though from recipes with a heavy reliance on cheap cuts of meat and easy to grow vegetables that had to last through harsh winters.

'An interesting feature of army cooking highlighted in the book is that the meat from fat was extracted to make dripping, which was used as an aid for frying and in the absence of butter, an example of how important it was to use every aspect of the meagre supplies provided.'
