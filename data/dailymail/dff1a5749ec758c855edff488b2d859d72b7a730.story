A woman drove her car at speed over a cliff edge before plummeting 200 feet onto rocks at a National Trust beauty spot.

The motorist, in her 40s, drove her red Fiat across 20-ft of grass before plunging over the cliff.

Police were scrambled to the scene in Brook, near Freshwater, on the Isle of Wight at 6.40pm last night.

Tragic: A woman drove her mini supercar at speed over a cliff edge before plummeting 200 feet onto rocks at a National Trust beauty spot

The woman, from Dorset, died at the scene from her injuries.

 body work, painted with a white stripe, had been badly damaged by the 
impact.

All that seemed to be left intact were the alloy wheels.

Investigation: Police today confirmed the woman's death was not being treated as suspicious

Wreckage: Her body has been recovered and taken to hospital where a post-mortem examination and formal identification are due to take place

Hampshire Police today confirmed they are not treating the incident as suspicious.

A spokesman said: 'A woman, believed to be the driver, was pronounced dead at the scene.

'Her
 body has been recovered and taken to hospital where a post-mortem 
examination and formal identification are due to take place this week.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious.

'Detectives do not believe anyone else was travelling in the car. No other vehicles or people are thought to have been involved.

'Police are in the process of contacting and informing next-of-kin.

'HM Coroner has been notified.'

A helicopter flies overhead at the scene of the tragedy

On the rocks: The car, a red 500 Abarth, a souped-up version of the Fiat 500, could be seen this morning on rocks 16 feet from the cliff face

Scenic: The section of coast is well used by tourists who come for walking, fossil hunting and windsurfing

Residents today said the road was very straight but was close to the sheer chalk cliffs and there was no fence or barrier.

One local, who did not want to be named, said: 'I don’t think it had anything to do with the bad weather we had last night either because it all happened before it started raining.'

She added: 'There was a mass of police vehicles in attendance last night for around an hour.

'There was also a helicopter shining its light down on the cliffs.'

The section of coast is well used by tourists who come for walking, fossil hunting and windsurfing.

The National Trust owns a small section of land by the public beach and the nearby hamlet of Brookgreen.

Nearby picturesque Brook Bay is a semi-circular rocky beach which faces out to the English Channel.

Last night’s incident happened just a week after a 20-year-old man drove his van off 300 ft high cliffs on the east side of the Island.

The vehicle was discovered under water at the bottom of Culver Cliffs, near Sandown.
