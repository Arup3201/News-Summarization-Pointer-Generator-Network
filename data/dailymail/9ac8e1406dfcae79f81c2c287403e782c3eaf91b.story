Gates, who spoke in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum on Friday said that the U.S. still has a 'phenomenal' amount of technological innovation in our country.

Gates also said that in order to keep the talent in America the U.S. needs to fix the immigration system to create jobs around Americans regardless of their country of origin.

'It is kind of perverse to provide the education and then, even somebody who’s being offered a very high-paying job, they’ve got to go to Canada or back to India,' Gates said Friday on Fox's 'Opening Bell with Maria Barroom.'

Gates also said that in order to keep the future of technology in America the U.S. desperately needs to improve its education system.

Gates mentioned that Common Core, a set of standards for kindergarten through high school, only creates a uniform curriculum that doesn't leave room for new knowledge.

He said it also, 'doesn't constrain how teachers do things.'

He emphasized that the U.S. needs set standards, 'that are high enough that we are competitive with other countries.'

In addition to Immigration Gates spoke on healthcare in our country and how we spend so much more when compared to other countries.

He said that the healthcare issue is not partisan, rather we should work as one to study why we are not working as efficiently as we could be.

'I’m afraid that we’ve been distracted from the issue of why we spend so much more than others,' he explained.

'This should be a technocratic thing, not a partisan thing, why this system is not working as efficiently as it could.'

Bill gates and his wife Melinda released their annual letter on children's mortality rates and mobile banking as a tool for healthcare and the results are astonishing.

Gates believes that children's mortality rates will be cut in rates by 2030 and that 82.5 billion people will have access to inexpensive financial services through mobile banking.

In addition to talking about how Gates helps to change the world he spoke about the future of Microsoft (MSFT).

The software now has its newest operating system, Windows 10, and also innovation in virtual reality.
