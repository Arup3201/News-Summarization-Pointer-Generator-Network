These Koi carp are happier with a baby's bottle than a sprinkling of fish food.

At a market in Ayutthaya, Thailand, tourists flock to the water's edge to feed the fish in the bizarre fashion.

Lunch time: These hungry fish certainly aren't shy in coming forward as they flurry to the surface to be fed by tourists clutching baby bottles 

Attraction: The bizarre attraction pictured here at a floating market in Ayutthaya, Thailand, has become hugely popular with tourists to the area

As soon as the fish see the rubber teat entering the water, they flock around the bottle in a battle to be the first for lunch.

Koi carp come in a variety of vibrant colours, patterns and prices and collecting these beautiful creatures is a serious business.

Roots: Koi is an abbreviation of Nishikigoi, the Japanese term for 'brocaded carp'

Koi is an abbreviation of Nishikigoi, the Japanese term for 'brocaded carp'.

The record price paid by a UK collector is £100,000 for 'Jessica Rose', which won the All-Japan Koi Show in 2006.

More realistically, beginners can pay £5 for a tiddler, £20 for a 6in example and £2,000 for a three-footer that may be decades old.

When looking after a Koi Carp, costs can mount rapidly: a clay conditioner for the koi's scales works out at £80 for two weeks' supply and 10 days' food for 20 carp is about £100.

Healthy fish can grow up to 4ft over decades and investors tend to go for examples with a broad, blunt-nosed head and a thick well-muscled tail. The skin should be even-textured.

There are 13 basic varieties with the Kohaku the most popular.

These are white with red 'beni' (spotted) patterns.

The most collectible have deep, uniform shading. However, find one with a Japanese 'sun' on its forehead and you might have a fish worth tens of thousands of pounds.
