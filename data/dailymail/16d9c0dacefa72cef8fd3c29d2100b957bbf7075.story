A teenager who lost her legs and an arm to meningitis has defied the odds to return to horse riding.

Triple amputee Ellie Bishop, 13, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, developed life threatening meningitis aged five and was rushed to hospital, where doctors warned her parents she was just 30  minutes from death.

Medics battled to save her life but were forced to amputate both of her legs above the knee, one of her arms and part of her remaining hand to save her life.

Ellie Bishop, 13, had to have her legs, an arm and part of her remaining hand amputated when she developed meningitis at just five years old

Ellie has adapted to life without the same mobility as others and has kept up all of the hobbies she had before meningitis.She is now hoping to become a Paralympic dressage rider.

Ellie's mother Karen Dunnaway, 31, said: ‘Ellie has been through such a lot and has really been very determined to carry on a normal life.

‘Horses are her passion and she used to ride before she became ill and was adamant she would get back in the saddle one day.’

Just 12 months after her illness, Ellie had a saddle custom made for her and she began to ride horses again.

Ms Dunnaway said: ‘All me and her father Paul have wanted is for Ellie to make a good recovery. She was so close to death so we were relieved when she was stable.

‘The last thing I was thinking about was her getting back on a horse. But we have never stopped her doing anything and her attitude is amazing.’

Ellie was diagnosed with meningitis and septicaemia after she developed sickness, a high temperature and a blotchy red rash. Her father rushed her to hospital where she would found to be seriously ill

Ellie was diagnosed with meningitis in 2006 after developing sickness and a high temperature. Her parents took her to see her GP, who thought she had a viral infection.

However, within hours Ellie started to develop a blotchy rash on her arms and legs and her father rushed her to Sandwell Hospital, in the West Midlands.

Doctors diagnosed Ellie with meningitis and she was transferred to University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

Ms Dunnaway said: ‘At the time I didn't have a proper understanding of meningitis, but she had doctors all around her and we knew it was serious.’

When she had recovered from her illness, Ellie returned to horse riding using a specially adapted saddle. She now rides her horse, Mollie, three times a week and dreams of become a Paralympic dressage rider

Over the next ten days the youngster battled for her life, and her diagnosis was confirmed as meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia.

Ms Dunnaway said: ‘At the time I told Ellie, "the doctors are going to have to take your legs or you are going to leave Mummy and go to heaven".

‘She asked me to show her her legs, as they were covered up and said she didn't like them anyway. She was so grown up and brave.’

She added: ‘One day when I came into the ward she was with a play therapist who was helping her paint.

Ellie (pictured before her illness) also enjoys cooking and swimming now and her mother says she believes Ellie can do anything she puts her mind to

Ms Dunnaway said: 'Horses rely a lot upon being guided by legs and as Ellie doesn't have any she has to use other parts of her body language. It is important for Ellie to bond with her horse, but also for the horse to bond with Ellie'

‘She was holding the paintbrush in her mouth. It was the happiest I'd seen her for a long time and I was so glad.’

Ellie now makes time to ride her horse, Mollie, at least three times a week and also enjoys swimming and cooking.

Ms Dunnaway said: ‘Horses rely a lot upon being guided by legs and as Ellie doesn't have any she has to use other parts of her body language. It is important for Ellie to bond with her horse, but also for the horse to bond with Ellie.’

She added: ‘Often Ellie will wake up before me in the morning and surprise me with homemade pancakes.

Ellie's mother, Ms Dunnaway (pictured with Ellie) said: 'I never discourage her from doing anything - I firmly believe she can do whatever she wants to'

‘She loves cooking and has taught herself how to do it. If she drops something then she drops it- it isn't an issue.

‘I never discourage her from doing anything- I firmly believe she can do whatever she wants to.’

Chris Head, of Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘Ellie and her family know better than anyone how quickly meningitis and septicaemia can strike.

‘Despite suffering from life-changing after-effects, which is sadly the case with many of our members, Ellie is still able to enjoy life to the full and doesn't let her amputations hold her back.

‘Vaccines have almost eliminated many types of meningitis and septicaemia, but they still present a very real threat so make sure you know the symptoms, trust your instincts and seek medical help.’

Early warning signs of bacterial meningitis - the more serious form - include pain in the muscles, joints or limbs, unusually cold hand and feet, shivering and pale or blotchy skin.

The next symptoms to develop are often a severe headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and feeling generally unwell.

As the condition develops the patient may suffer drowsiness, confusion, fits, a fear of bright lights, a stiff neck, fast breathing and a blotchy red rash that does not fade when a glass is pressed against it.

In babies and young children the symptoms include being floppy and unresponsive, becoming irritable and not wanting to be held, unusual crying, vomiting, pale and blotchy skin, loss of appetite, a staring expression and being very sleepy.
