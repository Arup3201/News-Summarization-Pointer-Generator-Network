Barbara Bush has given her verdict on George H.W. Bush's newly-shaved head, saying it makes him look 'beautiful - and younger'.

The 89-year-old former president took the razor to his head on Wednesday in a show of support for the two-year-old son of one of his secret servicemen, who is battling leukemia.

'I was shocked and surprised and thrilled,' his wife told their granddaughter, Jenna Bush Hager, on the Today show on Friday. 'I think he looks beautiful, and he looks younger.'

Bush himself explained that the haircut came after more than 20 secret servicemen shaved their heads for little Patrick. He called it 'the right thing to do'.

Support: Former President George H. W. Bush poses with two-year-old Patrick, for whom he shaved his head in a show of support. The boy, the son of a secret serviceman, is battling leukemia

'A lot of the agents saved their 
heads, why not me?' he asked. 'It was the right thing to do. All of the 
agents of the agents had done it and I wanted to show solidarity with 
them.'

The boy's father, Jon, is among their ranks.

'They're like family with us,' Bush said of the team. 'It was fun. He's a cute little guy.'

An
image taken in Walker's Point, Kennebunkport, Maine on Wednesday shows Bush's arms around Patrick, who was diagnosed several months ago. Both are 
showing off their bald heads and matching collared polo shirts.

Bush
said that he did not think the little boy had any idea that he was in 
the arms of a former president - and that he probably wouldn't have 
cared much anyway.

But his 
wife said that Patrick's parents were
very aware of the kindness Bush was showing their child.

Touching: His granddaughter Jenna, who interviewed him for the show, places a kiss on his newly bald head

Proud: Jenna speaks with her grandparents, who said the little boy had no idea who Bush was 

'His wife started crying, she was really touched,' Barbara said. 

In a statement, parents Jon and Alexandra, said: 'We
are humbled and honored by the support and generosity that President 
and Mrs Bush and our secret service have shown towards our son.'

Jenna added that it was a 
particularly personal matter for her grandparents, who lost their 
daughter when she was just four to leukemia more than 60 years ago. Robin, their second child after George W. 
Bush, died in October 1953.

President Bush remembered that his daughter would say, 'I love you more than tongue can tell'.

Happy to help: Former President Bush grins as he undergoes his transformation on Wednesday

New look: He said that shaving his head along with his secret servicemen was 'the right thing to do'

Matching: Jenna shared this picture on Twitter of her father and Patrick wearing similar outfits

'He always answered, "I love you more",' Barbara added.

The family is not releasing Patrick's last name to protect their privacy. 

As the boy undergoes chemotherapy, Bush's Protective Division has launched a website at www.patrickspals.org to assist with Patrick's medical bills as he undergoes chemotherapy.

According to the website, Patrick was diagnosed with leukemia several months ago.

'While his prognosis is very positive, there will be many years of treatment ahead,' the website says. 'We cannot thank both President AND Mrs. Bush enough for their generosity and concern!'

The event involves a 50-mile motorcycle ride through the Maine countryside followed by a lunch and silent auction to raise funds for Patrick's treatments.

Bush's decision to shave his head won wide praise on Twitter.

Former President Bill Clinton tweeted, '41, you look great. Love what you're doing.'

President Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, tweeted, 'Noted [with] great admiration.'
