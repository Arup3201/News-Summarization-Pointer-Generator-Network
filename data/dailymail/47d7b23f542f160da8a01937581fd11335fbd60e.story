Victoria avoids all eye contact. Her gaze alternates between boring into the ground and scouring the horizon out the window. Her right foot taps nervously on the wooden floor.

She is one of the 55 female trafficking victims helped each year at the crisis intervention centre run by the International Organisation for Migration and the Ministry of Labour in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau.

Her story is shocking. 'A childhood friend told me she worked in a boutique in Dubai and could help me get a similar job,' she explains. 'She put me in touch with a guy who arranged my trip to Odessa [in Ukraine] and onward from Kiev to Dubai.

'In Dubai I was met by a Russian speaking woman, Oxana, who took me to a flat with six other girls from Eastern Europe.

'Oxana told me I’d been sold and took my passport away. I refused to see clients and as a result, was denied food. My cries and pleas were met with blows and kicks.'

Appalling though it is, Victoria is by no means alone. She's just one of an estimated 800,000 women and children tricked and trafficked into a life of beatings, rape and torture every year.

In Moldova, the country that she - and I - once called home, human trafficking is a huge problem, with an estimated 25,000 Moldovans trafficked abroad in 2008 according to Moldova’s national Bureau of Statistics.

Men are taken to work on building sites and farms, while women like Victoria are mostly sold into the sex trade in Turkey, Russia, Cyprus, the UAE, and elsewhere.

Tragic: Victoria is just one of an estimated 800,000 women sold into sex slavery abroad each year

Hell: Many of those taken abroad suffer extreme violence and are beaten and raped by their 'owners'

Speaking out: Stela Brinzeanu's new novel Bessarabian Nights focuses on trafficking

Victims can be as young as 
12-years-old, with the International Organisation for Migration 
estimating that 10 per cent of the Moldovans taken are children.

I met Victoria while researching my 
novel, Bessarabian Nights, which follows two friends as they attempt to 
save a third from the trafficking gangs still common in Eastern Europe.

Shockingly, many of the women I spoke to had been sold into prostitution by people they knew and told me that many of recruiters were women.

Some of the girls didn't even think of themselves as victims: Having previously been abused 
by family members, they considered violence to be normal.

One
 girl who certainly thought that way was Irina, a girl brutalised and left 
pregnant by her violent father before being trafficked to Turkey.

‘There is nothing extraordinary or 
unusual about my story. Or I don’t think so,' she told me. 'Like many other families in
 Moldova, ours was very poor – so poor we fed our dog dried corn.

'After my mother died of breast cancer and father went to prison for raping me, I was left alone and pregnant.

'My godmother offered to help with the abortion and arranged for me to go 
to Turkey. "The conditions are much better there and they’ll look after 
you," she told me. 

'At the airport in Istanbul I was met by two men who 
drove me to a property where there were three other girls, Moldovan and 
Ukrainian, and told me I was to serve their clients.

'I told them I was 
pregnant but the men raped me in the next room that same day.'

Frightening: Most of the women and children trafficked endure months if not years of torture before rescue

For rural girls like Irina, high
 unemployment, widespread domestic violence and rife alcoholism further 
exacerbate the problem and make them more vulnerable to human 
trafficking than their city dwelling counterparts.

Over half the victims I met were from the 
Moldovan countryside, where a patriarchal mentality and religious 
traditions still uphold discrimination against women.

The recruiters exploit the fact that 
these people are less knowledgeable about the process and risks of 
moving abroad for work, and as in Irina's case, tell them they'll be well treated when, in fact, the reality is quite different.

Although many do eventually escape their captors, the impact of being forced into slavery can have severe emotional consequences as Victoria makes plain.

'Locked up and under constant security, I saw no way out,' she continues. 'Weak from starvation and abuse, I agreed to seeing clients.

'There was no choice but work the streets and nightclubs every day, sometimes serving up to a dozen men or even more.

Risk: Those who live in rural areas are more at risk because of economic problems and poverty

Stela's new novel, Bessarabian Nights, is out now and available from Amazon

'My captors took all the money on the
 pretext I owed them for flights and accommodation. The security guy who
 drove me everywhere raped me every time I refused his advances, which 
was almost daily.

'My bruises and cuts were habitually covered with cheap make-up. After a few weeks I managed to use the phone of one of my clients and called a friend I knew in Dubai.

'She
 helped me run away and report my circumstances to a charity 
organisation there. I was promptly returned to Moldova.'

Others, such as Irina, find ways to adapt - even if that means overcoming repeatedly being raped when dealing with the aftermath of an abortion.

'I
 cried and pleaded them to spare me the ordeal [of being prostituted] but was told they had 
paid good money for me, which I had to return,' continues Irina.

'I was driven to various 
hotels and houses to see men for two weeks before I had the abortion. 
Days after, I was taken to see clients again.

'It
 was dreadful at the beginning and I was frightened. But the living 
conditions there were a lot better than at home and they gave us plenty 
of food too.

'I worked in Turkey for a year before we were arrested 
following a police raid and sent back to Moldova and Ukraine, 
penniless.'

Although for Irina and Victoria the nightmare is, for now at least, over, while poverty and unemployment in Moldova remain rampant, the problem is likely to continue.

Warning girls of 
the risks abroad is not enough. Viable alternatives such as skills 
training, employment opportunities and investment in human potential, 
needs to be more widely available.

Otherwise, regardless of the 
potential risks, men, women and children will continue to be trafficked out of Moldova. Ignorance, as much as 
desperation, is what sends them abroad.
