UEFA Under 17 European ChampionshipsWednesday - Ta'Qali Stadium, Attard, Malta

Kick-off 6pm (UK time)Live on British Eurosport

If England's Young Lions need any inspiration ahead of Wednesday night's UEFA Under 17 European Championship final with Holland, they only need to cast their minds back four years.

For a certain Ross Barkley - then 16 - stood in their shoes back in 2010, running the midfield as England beat Spain 2-1 to lift the trophy.

Now, the Everton man is heading to next month’s World Cup in Brazil as the country’s latest great hope and living proof that dreams can quickly be realised for talented young players.

John Peacock’s side will line up 
against the Dutch at the Ta’Qali Stadium in Malta hoping to guide 
England to a second win in this competition and take another step up the
 ladder.

The captain Ryan Ledson, coming through the ranks at Everton, is particularly keen to follow in Barkley’s footsteps.

‘Ross
 has gone from this level to the World Cup squad so quickly and he’s 
someone we all look up to,’ he said. ‘He’s an inspiration to everyone in
 the team.’

It is a 
sentiment echoed by coach Peacock, also in charge back in 2010 when the 
team featured the likes of Connor Wickham, Saido Berahino and Josh 
McEachran.

‘You hope someday that these players will go on to bigger and better things,’ he said.

‘The
 World Cup is just around the corner and we have experiences of players 
 that have come through our system and are now ready to play a part in 
Brazil. I think that’s what it’s all about.’

Peacock
 has one injury concern for the final in Newcastle United striker Adam 
Armstrong, who is rated 50-50 after hobbling out of the 2-0 semi-final 
win over Portugal with an ankle problem.

His
 team have already suffered defeat by Holland at this tournament – 2-0 
in a dead rubber final group game after they had already qualified for 
the last four.

Wins over 
Malta and Turkey had by that point set up a semi-final with Portugal, 
where second-half goals from Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke and Fulham 
midfielder Patrick Roberts sealed their progress.

Having
 already encountered Holland once, Peacock knows what to expect. 'I 
think there are two very good teams in the final, and two attacking 
teams. I would expect that it will be a real good game of football,’ he 
said.

'Holland have done 
well over the last few years, especially this age group, and they are 
doing exceptionally well in their development work.'

But
 he added an optimistic note: 'Back in England it is the same, and 
reaching this final will give everybody a lift. That’s the biggest plus 
point. Reaching this stage is a massive achievement for these players 
and will be a massive experience.'

Ledson expects a tough assignment too. He said: 'Holland are a good attacking side but it's a challenge and it's a great game for the lads to be involved in. We'll give it our best shot.'

GOALKEEPERS

Freddie Woodman (Newcastle United) - 17-year-old stopper who has established himself as No 1 at this age group during qualifying and has maintained that status at this tournament. Freddie is the son of former Northampton Town and Brentford player Andy Woodman, now goalkeeping coach at St James’ Park.

Sam Howes (West Ham United) - 16-year-old keeper who has already progressed to West Ham’s Under 21 side, making three appearances this season. Made his first England Under-17 appearances against Belgium at St George’s Park back in January.

DEFENDERS

Jonjoe Kenny (Everton) - Everton Academy product who can play right across the back four. The 16-year-old has demonstrated that impressive versatility in his 12 outings for Everton’s Under 21 side this season and that good form has continued in Malta. Even got himself on the teamsheet in the 4-1 win over Turkey.

Taylor Moore (Lens) - A rare 
example of an England international who plies their trade abroad, 
Walthamstow-born Moore moved to France with his parents aged seven and 
is a member of the Lens Under 19 team. Made his debut in the Algarve 
Tournament back in February and can also play in a midfield role. Delivered an excellent ball from the half-way line to set Dominic Solanke free to open the scoring against Portugal in the semi-final.

Mandela Egbo (Crystal Palace) - Right-back who has stepped up from the England Under-16s to the Under 17s this season and featured in qualifiers against Gibraltar and Albania.

Dael Fry (Middlesbrough) - Tall centre-half who names Jonathan Woodgate as his inspiration. Played out of his natural position at left-back during the qualifying win over the Czech Republic back in March, having made his Under 17 debut against Belgium two months earlier.

Joe Gomez (Charlton Athletic) - Tall, 16-year-old centre-half who played in five out of the six European Championship qualifiers, during which England conceded just the one goal. Has a good chance of making Charlton's first team next season and has furthered his case here.

Tafari Moore (Arsenal) - Dreadlocked right-back who plays regularly for Arsenal’s Under 21 team and was a member of their Under 18 squad that made the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup this season. Played every minute of the Elite Round of qualifiers.

MIDFIELDERS

Lewis Cook (Leeds United) - Tough tackling 17-year-old who will help protect the defence. Has been a regular in John Peacock’s squads for some time and part of the England youth set-up for three years now.

Ryan Ledson (Everton) - The England captain features in all the qualifiers and is skilled in both the defensive and offensive aspects of his central midfield position. Was involved in 17 matches for Everton’s Under 21 team this season and was named on the bench as an unused substitute by Roberto Martinez for the recent Premier League matches against Southampton and Manchester City.

Callum Cooke (Middlesbrough) - 17-year-old attacking midfielder who isn’t afraid to run at opposition defenders and carry the attack. Has been involved in John Peacock’s squad for some time and scored both goals in the 2-2 draw with Portugal during the Algarve Tournament.

Josh Sims (Southampton) - Left-sided winger who is the latest to emerge from Southampton’s prestigious Academy and he has made his Under 21 debut at club level this season. Burst on to the international scene with a goal and an assist in the 2-0 win over Holland at the Algarve Tournament.

Demetri Mitchell (Manchester United) - Skilful winger who can also play up front and a member of Man United’s Under-18 side. His explosive pace has caused problems for defenders on the international stage since he scored a spectacular solo goal against Northern Ireland in the Victory Shield in 2012.

Joshua Onomah (Tottenham Hotspur) -
 Playmaker who will hope to supply England’s forwards during the 
European Championships after providing important assists in the 
qualifiers against Albania and Italy. He featured for Tottenham’s 
Under-21 team and was an unused substitute in the UEFA Europa League tie
 against Dnipro back in February.

FORWARDS

Patrick Roberts (Fulham) - Probably the best known of the England squad after making Premier League appearances for Fulham against Man City and Everton this season. Roberts was also the stand-out performer in Fulham’s run to a first ever FA Youth Cup final, scoring in the second leg as they lost 7-6 on aggregate to Chelsea. His excellent season has continued into this tournament and after two goals against Malta in the group stage, he made the semi-final against Portugal safe with a superb individual goal late on.

Adam Armstrong (Newcastle United)
 - 17-year-old centre forward who has enjoyed a breakthrough season, 
with Alan Pardew naming him in the Newcastle squad for nine Premier 
League matches. A regular scorer in Newcastle’s Under-21 team too and 
also scored an important goal in the final qualifier against Italy. Scored against Malta and Turkey in the group phase to continue this form but hobbled out of the semi-final with an ankle injury.

Isaiah Brown (Chelsea)
 - Another member of Chelsea’s victorious FA Youth Cup squad, Brown is 
particularly effective in tandem with Solanke and hotly tipped for a 
bright future. He has also featured in Chelsea’s Under-21 side and also 
in the UEFA Youth League. Scored the winner in the Elite Round qualifier
 against Albania.

Dominic Solanke (Chelsea) - The hero of Chelsea’s Youth Cup success, with two decisive goals in the second leg, Solanke also scored two vital goals in England’s qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Italy. This was in addition to his three goals in the preliminary qualifying round. Scored with a deft chip to open England's scoring in the semi-final with Portugal.
