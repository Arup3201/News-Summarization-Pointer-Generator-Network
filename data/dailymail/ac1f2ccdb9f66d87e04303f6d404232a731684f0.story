Real Madrid are 90 minutes from being crowned the best team on the planet after beating Mexican side Cruz Azul 4-0 to reach Saturday's World Club Cup final.

With their 21st straight win they won Tuesday's semi-final in Marrakech to set-up a potential showdown with the Copa Libertadores winners San Lorenzo who first need to beat Auckland City in Wednesday's second semi-final.

Madrid started like a team that had won their last 20 games and could have been ahead inside three minutes when full back Dani Carvajal tore down the right and crossed to Karim Benzema. The Frenchman headed the ball down to Cristiano Ronaldo inside the six-yard box but his shot was saved at point-blank range by Jesus Corona in the Cruz Azul goal.
