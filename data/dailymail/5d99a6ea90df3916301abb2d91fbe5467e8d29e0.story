Garth Crooks has taken aim at 'indiscreet' Harry Redknapp's claims that certain England players during his time at Tottenham tried to find ways of skipping international duty.

Writing on his Kick It Out blog, former Spurs favourite Crooks said players who can't handle the pressure of playing for England deserved Redknapp's 'protection and discretion'.

Instead Redknapp treated these 'deep psychological fears' like 'cocktail-party gossip.'

Hitting out: Garth Crooks has written that Harry Redknapp was 'indiscreet' in his remarks about England players who shirked international duty when at Tottenham

Claims: Harry Redknapp said in an interview there were certain England players at Tottenham who tried to shirk international duty

The Queens Park Rangers manager criticised the commitment of young English players to the national team in an interview with BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme last week.

He highlighted experiences of managing England players while in charge of Tottenham, claiming there were 'two or three' who did not want to go away with the national team.

Redknapp recalled: 'They would come to me 10 days before the game and say, 'Gaffer, get me out of that game, I don't want to play in that game'. That was how it was. I'd say, 'you're playing for your country, you should want to play'.

'(They would say) 'Nah, my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks, I don't want to play' and that is the truth, so it makes you wonder.'

Shirked responsibility: Redknapp said that when Tottenham manager, two or three England players would look for excuses to get out of international games

When challenged, Redknapp, who was strongly linked with the England job following the departure of Fabio Capello, refused to identify the players in question.

And now Crooks has condemned Redknapp's remarks, saying the players in question did not deserve such 'vilification.'

He wrote: 'The revelations made by Harry Redknapp last week, apart from being outrageously indiscreet, touched on this very point.

'Coping with pressure has always been a fundamental part of playing at the highest level.

Pressure point: Crooks argues that England players wanting to pull out of fixtures is a sign they have a psychological problem

'However, if certain England players go to their club manager asking them to be pulled out of an international fixture because they can’t cope with the pressure, then they deserve his protection and  discretion, not vilification.

'By a player announcing he’s not big enough for the occasion in the same way a player might refuse to take a penalty in a shoot-out, it should not to be used in order to sell a few more newspapers or as a baseball bat to take revenge on a player who may have let you down in some capacity in the past.

'These revelations are deep psychological fears and for a manager to treat them like cocktail-party gossip is appalling.'
