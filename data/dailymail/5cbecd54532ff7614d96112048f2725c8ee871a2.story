Cost-cutting: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said there was a need to 'achieve savings as quickly as possible'

New powers to seize and sell off the cars of convicted criminals to help cover their legal aid bills will be introduced as part of plans to cut the cost of the scheme.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the Government will also speed up moves towards lawyers competing on price for legal aid work on criminal cases.

Mr Grayling, who told MPs the urgency was due to the need to 'achieve savings as quickly as possible', said the first contracts could go live in autumn 2014 - a year earlier than previously announced.

Lawyers warned the move - designed to help reduce the £2billion legal aid bill for England and Wales - would not protect the 'safeguards and qualities which we must expect from our justice system'.

Mr Grayling also confirmed that new powers to seize and sell convicted criminals' cars to help meet the cost of legal aid in their cases would come into force in July this year.

In a written statement he said the move would 'help ensure that defendants contribute towards the cost of their otherwise taxpayer-funded defence'.

Ministry of Justice figures show some £75million in legal aid has been ordered to be repaid since 2010, but so far only £16million has been received, a report in the Telegraph said.

Mr Grayling said: 'We have already made clear our intention to introduce price competition in the criminal legal aid market, as the best way to ensure long-term sustainability and value for money.'

Under the new timetable the consultation will be published next month, with tendering opening in competition areas in autumn and the first contracts going live a year later.

The Bar Council said competition by price was a 'blunt instrument' which could damage standards.

'Blunt instrument': Lawyers warned the introduction of price competition would not protect the 'qualities and safeguards we must expect from our justice system'

Maura McGowan QC, chairman of the Bar, said: 'Just as the Government faces pressure, we must also recognise the enormous pressure which publicly funded legal practitioners, particularly at the junior end of the profession, are under and how vital it is to the future of the justice system that they are able to pursue a viable career as specialist advocates and in the public interest.

'One of the proposals is a model based on price competition, which is a blunt instrument.

'It assures none of the safeguards and qualities which we must expect from our justice system. It cannot be one which properly underpins the effective operation of the rule of law.

'We will study the consultation document very carefully when it is published. There is no reference to advocacy services in what we have seen today.'We will make the case in the strongest terms that the Ministry of Justice needs to recognise the importance of maintaining the Bar, especially the junior Bar.

'Decisions on allocation of work must be made on quality and not on money alone. We have made these points, in person, to the Lord Chancellor and will make them again in our formal response.

'We recognise that today's announcement does not outline the many other options for reform, but we will engage constructively with the Ministry of Justice to investigate all other avenues, before the consultation is published.'

On Monday Britain's most senior judge warned that cuts to legal aid could lead to 'people taking the law into their own hands'.

Lord Neuberger said he was concerned 
that cuts to free legal advice and free courtroom lawyers would 'start 
to undermine the rule of law because people will feel like the 
Government isn't giving them access to justice in all sorts of cases'.

Criticising the judge’s remarks, Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘If the system of justice over which his lordship presides was not so inaccessible to my constituents, justice would be even-handed in the first place.'

Mr Carswell said it was because the 'self-serving legal elite' had made justice so expensive that lawyers had to be subsidised by the state.

Criminologist Dr David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘It is inappropriate for the president of the Supreme Court to make such political comments.
