This boy wouldn't have been allowed to have fun with a sparkler thanks to health and safety officers

Over-zealous ’elf and safety officers extinguished the fun for hundreds of families attending public firework displays at the weekend by banning sparklers.

Families said they were ‘disgusted’ by the rules, which needlessly upset children and patronised parents.

The Round Table group, which organised 70 firework parties this year in public parks and stadiums, has also spoken out against the rules, which it says it is bound to comply with.

At one of the displays on Saturday night in Moseley, Birmingham, a large sign stated ‘Strictly no sparklers’ on site.

Around 3,000 people attended, paying £5 for adults and £2 for children to enter. But anybody who attempted to light sparklers were told to extinguish them immediately.

Gordon Avery, from Sheldon, Birmingham, who was there with grandsons Kieran, 13, and Elliot, 11, said: ‘There are so many kids here, if they are being supervised by their parents then I don’t see why it is a problem.

‘I’ve gone to fireworks shows for decades. It’s health and safety gone mad.’

Similar rules were in place at other Round Table displays across the country.

At its fireworks party on Saturday night at Ascot Racecourse, stewards also warned members of the public not to light sparklers.

The event website advised: ‘For your own safety, we do not allow you to bring alcohol or your own fireworks to the event. This includes sparklers: They are too dangerous where there are crowds and excited children.’

Cait Allen, chief executive of Round Table, agreed that banning sparklers was ‘health and safety gone mad’, but added: ‘It’s just the venues’ insurance companies. We have to comply.’

A major new campaign has been launched ahead of Bonfire Night to highlight the stress fireworks can cause to cats, dogs and wildlife.As research revealed that 49 per cent of owners say their pet is afraid of the noises of firework season, Ceva Animal Health UK is calling for veterinary practices and the public to back a major new online petition.The e-petition appeals for the Government to enforce all fireworks manufacturers to carry information about pet and wildlife safety both online and on packaging and is available at: http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/36648.Ceva, whose pheromone products Feliway and Adaptil are proven to help pets in stressful situations, has joined with TV vet Marc Abraham to highlight the extent to which pets are affected by loud noises at this time of year.Signs of stress in dogs include trembling, shaking, hiding behind furniture, barking excessively and trying to run away.  If the problem isn’t confronted at the outset it could result in long-term, serious noise phobias developing.Vet Marc Abraham says: 'Pet safety, health and happiness are serious issues arising on and around every Bonfire Night. During the year I treat a number of animals suffering from stress-related health problems - many of these originating from loud noises such as fireworks or an unsettled environment. 'All pet owners have a responsibility to prepare their dog or cat well ahead of Bonfire Night - employing preventative measures such as creating safe dens, adjusting normal walking routines to avoid the dark, and providing pheromone appeasing products such as Adaptil and Feliway.'If you own a pet, or live next door to someone with a cat or a dog, please make sure everyone's educated in animal welfare and safety when it comes to Bonfire Night.'Sarah Endersby at Ceva Animal Health UK, said: 'This will be the second year running we have called upon the fireworks industry to recognise its responsibilities when it comes to protecting pets and wildlife during what is the most stressful season for them. For example, many dogs find fireworks distressing and may go on to develop noise phobia.'Many owners will seek advice from pet specialists such as vets, vet nurses, pharmacists and pet shop staff. However, by producing warnings on the packaging, fireworks manufacturers can also help advise and guide pet owners to minimise the stress caused to pets.'
