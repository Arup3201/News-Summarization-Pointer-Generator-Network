For Rob Kardashian keeping up with his famous sisters isn't easy.

The self-titled 'fat boy' has long been overshadowed by his ambitious older siblings, who have been known to call him the 'jobless loser' of the family.

But the  26-year-old seemed bent on turning his image around as he dragged big sister Khloe Kardashian to pick up a box of his new line of designer socks in Los Angeles, on Thursday.

The two siblings wore athletic trainers for the business outing as Khloe followed closely behind her younger brother- who was carrying a cardboard box apparently full of samples for his sock line called Arthur 
George.

While Rob has been desperately trying to drop 40lbs, ever since his weight gain after breaking up 
with British singer Rita Ora, Khloe is a different story.

The 28-year-old recently lost a whopping 30lbs and has clearly been enjoying all the attention her newly slender figure has been garnering lately.

The youngest of the Kardashian sisters showed off her toned and curvaceous form in pedal pusher leggings and a form fitting black shirt.

Topping her getup was a zip up velour jumper as she wore her brunette locks loose over her shoulders.

Rob, on the other hand, opted for more loose-fitting attire as he donned gym socks, ostensibly featuring one of his palm frond designs, and baggy exercise trunks.

Completing the young entrepreneur's sporty garb was an L.A. Dodgers baseball cap and a loose black T-shirt.

Rob, who topped the scales at 240 
pounds, has been having trouble dropping his excess weight as  he told People Magazine in March: 'I'm trying to lose 40 [by the fourth of July]. It's a little journey.'

The former Dancing with the Stars 
contestant reportedly exercises in the morning with his trainer and then
usually joins his friends on hikes, including his former dance partner 
Cheryl Burke.

Meanwhile, Rob has been cleared of all charges after being accused of attacking a female photographer in March.

The only son of Kris Jenner was due to face trial for misdemeanor battery and petty theft after allegedly attacking photographer Kassandra Perez (also known as Andra Vaik) and stealing her equipment in an altercation in Los Angeles which was sparked by her taking a shirtless picture of him as he worked out at the gym.

However, according to E! News, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Edward Moreton granted a  motion to dismiss the case after Rob's attorney, Robert Shapiro, presented a signed declaration from the photographer that she did not want him prosecuted.

Rob - who has been struggling with 
his weight ever since breaking up with singer Rita Ora last December - 
previously insisted the paparazzo was trespassing on private property in
order to get a shot of him.

He says he was justified in snatching
the memory card out of the camera, with eyewitnesses backing up his 
claim that the photographer was lying in wait in her car in the garage at his
West Hollywood gym.

Rob is now believed to have reached a civil agreement with the paparazzo.
