Standoff: Goerge Pickering, pictured, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse

A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled 'I'll kill all of y'all'.

Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston.

Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night.

Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a $30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said.

Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her.

He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in.

At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering's sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police.

Response: Police and a SWAT team arrived at the hospital. Pickering reportedly had one gun taken from him, but said he had a second

Pickering then allegedly said, 'You don't think that's the only weapon I have?', prompting fears of a second gun and causing the lengthy showdown with police.

But when he gave himself up, police found that he was not in fact armed. Early reports stated that Pickering had taken two hostages, but law enforcement later said there were no captives.

A spokesman for the Tomball police department said Picerking fell ill during the standoff and was treated in the hospital overnight - and was still there Sunday afternoon. He does not yet have an attorney.
