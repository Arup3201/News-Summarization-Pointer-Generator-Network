Fulham are to bring Alan Curbishley back as director of football – nine months after sacking him from the same role.

Curbishley was dismissed as technical director when Felix Magath took over as manager last February – but is back in favour now he has gone.

Kit Symons, Magath’s replacement, wanted Curbishley to return, but the decision was taken out of his hands by Fulham’s appointments committee.

They interviewed several candidates but have now decided that the best man for the job was the man they had at the club in the first place – and Curbishley will now be restored to his old role, having lasted little more than two months previously.

Despite owner Shahid Khan gathering a five-man appointment committee of academy boss Huw Jennings, Nike director David Daly, Niall Quinn and former Fulham players Danny Murphy and Brian McBride, Symons was promoted to boss in late October having overseen five wins from his first nine games.

Fulham now sit in 17th with 19 points from 18 games in the Championship.
