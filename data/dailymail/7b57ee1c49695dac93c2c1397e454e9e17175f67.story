The man convicted of murdering an Atlanta Braves relief pitcher in 1995 has been released from prison ten years early, leaving the baseball player’s widow furious.

Dave Shotkoski was shot dead by Neal Evans in a botched armed robbery attempt in 1995; now his wife Felicia is incensed with the justice system for failing her.

‘I feel cheated, but so should the people on the streets with him today,’ she said, adding that the U.S. justice system seems to ‘favour the criminal’s rights over the victim’s.’

Furious: Widow Felicia Shotkoski, seen in 1995, says she feels 'cheated' that her husband's killer Neal Evans, right, was released from prison ten years early after being convicted of second-degree murder; he is pictured in court in 1997

Wrong place, wrong time: Dave Shotkoski, a relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, was murdered in March 1995 during a botched armed robbery

Ms Shotkoski told FoxNews.com that she found out about Evans’ release after receiving an automated message from the Florida Department of Corrections.

Priors: Neal Evans had been released early from prison five times since 1990

His first murder trial – which carried the death penalty – resulted in a hung jury, allowing Evans to make a plea deal in the following trial which left him with a 27-year sentence.

Evans, now 47, was convicted in 1997 for the murder of Mr Shotkoski in March of 1995. He was imprisoned at South Bay Correctional Facility in Florida.

According to Ms Shotkoski, several key witnesses did not testify in the second trial.

‘They put a convicted murderer on the streets, knowingly put a convicted murderer on the streets,’ Ms Shotkoski said.

She said the prison officials told her Evans earned 20 days of ‘gain time’ for every month of good behaviour, thus scrapping ten years off his sentence.

He is now living with his girlfriend in Riviera Beach.

However, he has a night-time curfew and must frequently report to his probation officer. Conditions of his probation include no drug use and no fraternizing with known felons.

Prison records show that Neal was serving his seventh prison sentence – his lengthy criminal record includes kidnapping, armed robbery, and burglary. 

According to wptv.com, this is Evans’ fifth early release from prison since 1990.

After his death: The Braves won the World Series in October 1995 against the Cleveland Indians

‘The laws have to change,’ Ms Shotkoski told FoxNews.com. ‘The government should not be letting convicted murderers back on the street.’

Mr Shotkoski, who was 30 at the time, was walking on a service road on the evening of March 24.

He was three blocks away from the hotel where the Braves were staying for spring training, and was shot several times on his after-dinner stroll during a botched armed robbery attempt.

His widow now lives in Chicago with their now-17-year-old daughter Alexis. 

She said she and Alexis have to live with the after-effects of the crime forever, while Evans can go on living his life.

‘Our justice system doesn’t make sense,’ Ms Shotkoski told wptv.com. 

‘They’re supposed to protect people’s rights and safety, yet it seems to save the criminals’ rights over the victims.’
