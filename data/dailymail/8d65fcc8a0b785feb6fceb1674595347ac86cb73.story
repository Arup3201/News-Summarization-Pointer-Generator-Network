Olympic champion Laura Trott extended her lead in the women's omnium to remain on course for Great Britain's fourth gold of the Track World Cup in London.

Trott won two of Saturday's three disciplines to hold a narrow overnight lead over Kirsten Wild, after the Dutchwoman finished runner-up in two events and won the other ahead of the Briton.

But Wild's 16th-placed finish in the fourth of six disciplines - the 500metres time-trial - saw Trott enhance her hold on gold medal position with two disciplines remaining on the third and final day of competition at the Lee Valley VeloPark.

Trott was third in 35.918 seconds behind Belgium's Jolien d'Hoore (35.595secs), who now occupies second place overall.

The Briton has 154 points, D'Hoore 132 and Wild and Australia's Isabella King have 126.

Phil Hindes exited the men's sprint competition in the first round.

Hindes, a specialist starter in the three-man, three-lap team sprint, was Britain's sole representative but could qualify only in 16th place, clocking 10.146secs for his flying 200m.

He met Fabian Puerta of Colombia, the ninth-fastest qualifier, in the first round but was beaten by half a bike length.
