Super League champions St Helens are poised to announce their new head coach.

Saints have acted quickly to appoint a successor to Nathan Brown, who stepped down after his club's 14-6 Grand Final triumph over Wigan last weekend, with an announcement set to be made at a press conference at Langtree Park on Monday morning.

The former St George and Huddersfield boss was released 12 months early from his three-year contract in order to take his young family back to Australia.

Another Australian, Daniel Anderson, has been linked with the vacancy following his successful stint at St Helens from 2005-08 but the speed with which the club have put themselves in a position to unveil their new man suggests a domestic appointment, with former hooker Keiron Cunningham the bookmakers' favourite.

Jamahl Lolesi, a former New Zealand international centre who followed Brown from Huddersfield to St Helens two years ago, could also be a contender.

Cunningham and Lolesi were assistants to Brown for the last two years while Cunningham coached the team alongside then general manager Mike Rush for most of the 2012 season following the departure of Royce Simmons.

The appointment of Cunningham would go down particularly well with supporters, who in 2010 voted overwhelmingly to immortalise him with a bronze, life-size statue, which was erected in the town centre and moved to Langtree Park when St Helens moved into their new stadium three years ago.

Cunningham, who turns 38 next week, made 419 appearances for his home-town club from 1993 to 2010.

He would become St Helens' first British head coach since Ellery Hanley held the reins from 1998 to 2000, since when Australians Ian Millward, Anderson, Mick Potter and Simmons held the post.
