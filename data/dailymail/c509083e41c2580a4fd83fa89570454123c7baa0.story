The newly-crowned Miss USA is facing claims she cheated her way to the top by faking a residency in Nevada, just to get ahead of the competition in her native state of California.

Former Disneyland princess Nia Sanchez, 24, won the competition on Sunday but sources say she doesn't even live in Nevada, the state she represented in the pagaent.

Sanchez isn't even a week into her reign and she's already juggling issues. In addition to the residency claims, Sanchez is still receiving flack for saying in the competition that women should learn self-defense in response to the rise of sexual assault on university campuses.

But the most serious claims surround her short-history in Nevada, where she was crowned the state's champion in January.

'She never actually moved to Nevada, but continued to work at Disney and live in California, setting up some minimum paper trail to appear like she was in Nevada and allow her to compete,' a 'well-placed' source told Fox News. 'Shanna Moakler is the Nevada director, and she personally coached Nia on what she needed to do to qualify in Nevada and skirt around the need to be actually from there.'

Moakler won the Miss USA competition in 1995 and went on to become the director of the Nevada pagent in 2011. However, Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claim she received special treatment.

She says she competed in the pagent by the books, living in Nevada for more than 18 months before signing up which is longer than the required six-month residency rule.

'[Las Vegas] is my home,' Sanchez said. 'I have a house there with a friend.'

'I actually had an agent that was working with me in Nevada a lot so I figured why not work in that state, and then I looked into the pageant program because I had done pageants before,' she explained.

'So I figured why not look into the one in Nevada? I really liked the way that it was run, the director that ran it, it seemed like a really healthy, well-run state program. So I decided to go there since I was living there anyway.'

According to her Miss USA application, Sanchez currently works for AC Model Agency which has branches in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles but her profile with the company lists her as living in California.

She defenends the profile, saying that's where all the lucrative modeling jobs are at but that most of her work is done in Las Vegas.

Before that, she worked at Disneyland as a princess and competed in the Miss California competition in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Another source said California pagaent queens often cross the state line to compete in Nevada becamase 'it was easier there'.

In California, pagaent girls went up against 100-200 other women whereas there were only 33 in the pool for Nevada's competition.

Sanchez says it's just not true that the competition is eaiser in Nevada.

'At least this year in Nevada, we had such strong compeititon. All the girls were not only beautiful, they were smart, college-educated well-rounded women…. I think it was a really tough competition.'

However there are other pagaent insiders who think it's wrong to move to compete in a different state, even if the girls do it according to competition rules.

'Most women are really proud to represent their home state, and it starts to become unfair to the hometown contestants competing when this happens,' said Angie Meyer, a former PR representative for the Miss California pageant. 'If you can’t win at home, you have no business competing elsewhere.'

Sanchez is also receiving criticism for comments she made during the competition in response to a question asking what should be done to combat a rise in sexual assault against women on college campuses.

Sanchez drew from her personal experience as a black belt in Taekwondo to answer the question, saying women could learn to protect thmselves.

But some found that answer controversial, saying it implies that only women are responsible for preventing sexual violence.

Sanchez responded to the backlash in an interview with HuffPo Live, saying she stands by her answer.

'We have 30 seconds to answer a question. I feel like all you can do up on that stage on national television is answer the best you personally know how, so I answered with something that I know.

'I always believe in women empowerment and women's encouragement and for me, in my life, that's self defense," she explained. "Maybe for somebody else it's a Taser or something else, but that's the way I could relate to it personally.'
