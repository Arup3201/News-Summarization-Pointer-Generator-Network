Devious: Shop worker Farrakh Nizzar told an elderly couple their winning £1million lottery ticket was worthless before trying to claim the prize for himself

A shop worker nicknamed 'Lucky' who tried to trick an elderly couple out of their winning £1million lottery ticket has been jailed for 30 months.

Farrakh Nizzar, 30, told Maureen Holt her EuroMillions ticket was worthless before asking if she wanted the ticket back.

Mrs Holt, 78, and her husband Fred, 80, who knew Nizzar by his nickname told him to bin the ticket.

But unbeknown to them, when Nizzar had scanned the ticket at his cousin’s Best One shop in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he worked, a message had flashed up advising the holder to contact Camelot.

Nizzar,
who was due to be deported to Pakistan before the incident, lied to the
Holts and kept the ticket for himself. He later called the lottery 
company himself in an attempt to keep the prize.

But the firm became suspicious when he was unable to answer questions about the winning ticket.

Camelot
checked CCTV and traced the rightful owners of the ticket using Mr 
Holt’s Tesco Clubcard to unite the couple with their £1million prize.

Nizzar pleaded guilty last month to one charge of fraud by false representation committed on May 31 this year.

He bowed his head and made no reaction as he was jailed at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester.

Passing sentence, Recorder Philip 
Cattan told the defendant: 'This goes to the heart of public confidence 
in the National Lottery.

'The courts must demonstrate to you and to others that this type of fraud will be met by significant custody.'

Back to its rightful owner: Nizzar had told Maureen Holt, 77, and her husband Fred, 80, that her EuroMillions ticket was worthless when she popped into her local corner shop to check if she had won a prize

Duncan
Wilcock, prosecuting, told the court that on June 21 this year, Mrs 
Holt and her husband, a retired Royal Navy engineer, had bought the 
EuroMillions ticket from a Tesco Extra in Oldham.

The couple then went to Spain to celebrate Mr Holt's 80th birthday. On their return  Mrs Holt went to Best One to check the ticket.

After being told it was worthless, Mrs Holt had purchased more tickets for the next draw, left the shop and 'thought no more about it,' Mr Wilcock sai, adding that Mrs Holt had thought Nizzar 'a really nice man, nice in all ways'.

Lies: But in fact when Nizzar had scanned the winning ticket at his cousin's Best One shop in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he worked, a message had flashed up advising the holder to contact Camelot

Checks: Camelot became suspicious about Nizzar's claims and checked Mr Holt's Tesco Clubcard
records to see that he had in fact bought the ticket at his local branch of Tesco extra in Oldham

When Camelot became suspicious and confronted Nizzar with the CCTV evidence he had 'looked at the floor for some time' but had claimed it was his ticket and blamed his 'bad 
memory,' Mr Wilcock told the court.

He was arrested by police on July 29 and pleaded guilty at 
Oldham Magistrates' Court last month.

Speaking from their home in Oldham, 
Mr and Mrs Holt, who have suffered sleepless nights because of the 
ordeal, said they were glad justice had been done.

In a statement the new millionaires said: 'We are glad that justice has been done and that this matter is now behind us. 

Finally celebrating: The new millionaires said they had suffered sleepless nights over the ordeal but were now looking forward to enjoying their lottery win

'We can now look forward to enjoying our lottery win and spending some time with our family and friends. We understand the defendant has written a letter to us and we look forward to reading this.'

Carolyn Smith, mitigating, said Nizzar came to the UK in 2007 on a student visa and completed a postgraduate diploma in business studies.

But when his student visa ran out, he was refused leave to remain in the UK and exhausted all his rights to appeal.

Waiting for an apology: The court heard that Nizzar had written the Holts a letter, which the couple said they were looking forward to reading

As an 'over-stayer' he had no rights to work or claim benefits and was faced with 'irresistible temptation' to claim the winning ticket himself.

He has since written a letter of apology to Mr and Mrs Holt, the court was told.

Miss Smith added: 'This offence was the very definition of opportunistic. When the machine indicated the ticket holder should contact Camelot he would have realised that was a winning ticket for a significant amount.

'Clearly this was a split second decision to keep it and tell Mrs Holt she had not won.'

A spokesperson from Camelot said: 'We 
have stringent operations in place to prevent and detect fraud and to 
monitor suspicious activity. Indeed,
the robustness of our investigation and the strength of evidence we 
provided in the case of Farrakh Nizzar resulted in him pleading guilty 
to the charge he faced.

The lottery terminal at the Best One shop has been removed and the shop is no longer licensed to sell tickets.
