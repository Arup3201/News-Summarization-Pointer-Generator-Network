The Tsarnaev brothers reportedly learned how to build a pressure-cooker bomb from a jihadi magazine, but apparently that guide didn't include a step instructing them to throw out evidence of their purchases.

On Wednesday, the jury deciding accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's fate were shown pictures of  inside his family's Honda Civic as well as his older brother Tamerlan's wallet, which contained receipts for bomb-making ingredients.

Tamerlan was killed in a dramatic shootout with police, but his brother escaped for several hours before being caught hiding in a dry-docked boat.

Tsarnaev, 21, faces the possibility of the death penalty for his role in the 2013 deadly bombings. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon.

On Wednesday, the jury deciding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death penalty trial were shown pictures taken from inside his family's Honda Civic. They were also shown images of older brother Tamerlan's wallet (above)

Tsarnaev's lawyers showed the jury a photo of receipts Tamerlan had from a gun and ammunition store and for two backpacks and a soldering gun purchased in the days and weeks before the marathon bombings, apparently in an attempt to show that Tamerlan had a larger role in the bombings than Dzhokhar did. Also in the wallet was a MoneyGram receipt reflecting a $900 transfer to Russia by Tamerlan.

But the prosecution made a case for Dzhokhar's equal participation on Wednesday, as they tried to connect him to the death of MIT police officer Sean Collier. 

The two brothers shot dead the campus police officer on April 18, after investigators released pictures of them as the primary suspects in the bombing.  

Two bloodied gloves were found near the gas pedal of the Honda Civic, and matched the DNA of slain MIT police officer Sean Collier 

Fingerprints experts also revealed that Dzhokhar's prints had showed up throughout the Civic. It's still unclear whether he was driving the car that night

Forensics experts testified that Dzhokhar's fingerprints were found throughout the Honda.

Jennifer Montgomery, a DNA analyst with the state police crime lab, testified Wednesday that blood was on a pair of gloves found near the gas pedal and driver's seat.

The blood on the glove matched MIT police officer Sean Collier, but the defense pointed out on cross-examination that all of the blood tested on Dzhokhars's sweatshirt was his own.

An MIT graduate student who was riding his bike by the scene of the shooting identified Dzhokhar as the man he saw leaning into Collier's police cruiser the night he was killed. Collier was shot six times, including three times in the head at close range.

While it wasn't determined in court on Wednesday which brother was wearing the glove, the chance that Dzhokhar was the shooter could damage the defense's claim that he was just following his older brother.

Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings but said his older brother was the mastermind in hopes of convincing the jury to give him a lower life-in-prison sentence as opposed to the death penalty.

On cross-examination, the defense pointed out that none of the blood tested on Dzhokhar's sweatshirt matched Officer Collier

After Collier's killing, the Tsarnaevs had a wild shootout with police in Watertown. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following the gunfight and being run over by his brother as he fled. Dzhokhar was found hours later, wounded and bloodied, hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown.

During earlier testimony Wednesday, jurors were shown two pipe bombs hurled at police during the shootout. Neither of those bombs exploded, but a third pipe bomb did. 

A pressure-cooker bomb similar to the bombs used in the marathon attacks caused a powerful explosion that shook houses on the street and sent debris raining down on police. 

Trooper Robert McCarthy also showed the jury a Tupperware container filled with explosive powder and fuses found in a car stolen by the Tsarnaevs just before the firefight with police. 

Testimony is scheduled to resume Thursday

Dzhokhar was a student at the university when the bombings happened. His brother briefly attended Bunker Hill Community College
