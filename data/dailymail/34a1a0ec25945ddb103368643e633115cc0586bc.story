It wasn't Lionel Messi, Neymar or even Kaka that stole the show in Beijing's first Superclasico de las Americas but Atletico Mineiro's Diego Tardelli.

Goals either side of half-time from the 29-year-old, who was fairly absent for much of the game, made it three wins from three for Brazil without conceding.

Much of the match build-up was centred on Beijing's pollution but thanks to a breezy Saturday afternoon it had all but cleared up in time for kick-off with levels dropping from 'Hazardous' to 'Moderate'.

Saturday's meeting was a friendly but that's hardly the appropriate word for this rivalry. Since 1914 there have been 95 meetings between the two nations with results almost even, Argentina on 36 victories, Brazil with 35 and 24 matches finishing in a draw.

Argentina had won all but one game in the last 10 - that being their World Cup final loss to Germany - while Brazil's poor campaign saw them come under intense scrutiny following a 7-1 loss to the Germans.

The tables had turned somewhat for Brazil with back-to-back 1-0 wins over Colombia and Ecuador but the jury was still out.

Argentinian fans had plenty to be happy about in the opening 10 minutes with Manchester City man Sergio Agüero getting in on goal after just 15 seconds and Messi introducing himself with a couple of darting runs much to the delight of the Chinese fans.

Argentina continued to knock on the door with Di Maria and Agüero again creating but their finishing let them down. 

Totally against the run of play though, Mineiro forward Diego Tardelli capitalised on some bad defending from Demichelis and Zabaleta to smash a volley home across Romero and give Brazil the lead on 28 minutes.

Tardelli had been a doubt before the game with an eye injury but his finish opened his international account in style.

Diego Tardelli was a peripheral figure for much of the game but popped up with both goals. See his pitch map in our brilliant Match Zone

Tardelli didn't see much of the ball but when he did he made it count and grabbed two goals from inside the area

Neymar followed up by destroying the Argentina defence, the Barcelona star getting past Mascherano and leaving him in his wake before easing past Demichelis but he couldn't finish the chance.

With Argentina suddenly on the back foot, Danilo was outpaced by Manchester United's Di Maria who was brought down in the box just five minutes before the break.

The stage was set for Messi but the talismanic playmaker missed the opportunity to level matters as he hit a poor penalty which Jefferson palmed away.

Brazil, clearly buoyed by their half-time lead, started much brighter. Chelsea full-back Filipe Luis hit a great chance over the bar before Neymar caused problems for Argentina. 

Oscar also went close before Diego Tardelli got in on the act again with his second on 64 minutes - the corner came in and from the flick-on Tardelli nodded the ball home to double Brazil's advantage.

Argentina continued to try and find a way back into the game but Brazil looked as if they might have scored more.

Kaka was introduced in the latter stages to a massive reaction from the Chinese fans, with one getting so excited he followed his hero onto the pitch only to be swiftly removed.
