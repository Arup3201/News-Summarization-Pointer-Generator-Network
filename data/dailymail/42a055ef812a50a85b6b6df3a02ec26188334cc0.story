Wilfried Bony has been truly outstanding for Swansea City and Manchester City will know they are getting a top-quality player.

His £30million move to the Etihad looks like it will be completed soon.

City are getting a brilliant striker to add to their already top-notch resources. Here, Martin Keown assesses Bony's strengths...

Manchester City look set to sign Wilfried Bony after opening talks with Swansea City over a £30million deal

The perfect blend of power and pace

When Bony is on the move, defenders simply bounce off him. He is so powerful and direct that he just swats opponents aside. He embarrasses defenders because they can’t lay a glove on him.

But there is great touch and skill to go with that immense strength.

He is good on the ball and his ability to launch off his left or right foot is similar to Sergio Aguero. He explodes past players in the same way.

Bony is so good at shifting his bodyweight and that makes it hard for defenders to read him and deal with him - once he’s past you, there is no catching him.

He also likes to stay central and as high up the pitch as he can so that when he runs off the shoulder of a defender, he can minimise the number of touches he needs before he can get a shot in.

And when he does get a shot away, he has fantastic composure in front of goal.

A man who loves to use his head

At six foot, Bony is no slouch, but he loves competing in the air. For somebody who’s so good on the ball, that is quite unusual.

He really enjoys getting on the end of crosses and has said in the past he only needs one from his team-mates to score. He hasn’t scored a header so far this season but he might fare better at City.

Swansea’s crossing accuracy in 2014-15 is the second worst in the league, whereas City's is the fourth best.

If they can feed Bony regularly then he is bound to keep scoring.

He’s quite similar to Radamel Falcao when it comes to heading - neither are huge but they beat opponents to the ball out of sheer desire. He wants to be first to it every time and uses his power well to make sure he is.

Not just a selfish striker

Bony's primary function is to score goals, but he is excellent at bringing others into the game.

If he comes deep his first thought is to see which of his team-mates is in the most dangerous position and he will try to find them.

He’s got quick, nimble feet, so he is able to pull off great bits of skill and he has a good awareness of how play is developing around him.

He plays with real imagination and moving to City to play with the likes of Aguero and David Silva will only improve that.

Experience tells

Bony is 26 but City are getting a player at the peak of his powers. It is a dream move so credit to him for working hard for years in the Czech Republic and Holland to progress.

That time has served him well but Swansea also deserve credit for giving him a chance to shine where others ignored him.

The competition at City will be tough, but he has already seen what it’s like not to play in every game - he was rotated by Garry Monk over Christmas almost as preparation to see how Swansea would cope without him.
