When Tina Ramsdell heard the story of British parents Brett and Naghmeh King being arrested in Spain, all she felt was empathy.

The Kings sparked an international manhunt when they took their five-year-old son Ashya, who has brain cancer, out of a UK hospital and fled to Spain without the consent of doctors.

Their decision drew global criticism but for Ms Ramsdell, 42, it just reminded her of her own story.

In 2005 Ms Ramsdell, from Gympie on Queenland's Sunshine Coast, sparked a five-day manhunt across Queensland and New South Wales when she went on the run with her six-year-old daughter Brandy who had terminal leukaemia.

Tina Ramsdell became a wanted fugitive after running away with her terminally ill daughter, Brandy, nine years ago

Brandy was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia two weeks before her sixth birthday in 2004 and underwent six months of chemotherapy while living in hospital

Brandy was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia two weeks before her sixth birthday in 2004 and underwent six months of chemotherapy while living in hospital.

The cancer went into remission but less than two months later Brandy started showing signs that she was sick again.

Ms Ramsdell has come to the defence of Brett and Naghmeh King who were arrested after they took their five-year-old son Ashya (pictured), who has brain cancer, out of a UK hospital and fled to Spain without the consent of doctors

'Her hair started growing back but then she just got sick again you could tell - they get tremors and they can't warm up,' Ms Ramsdell told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Ramsdell went to see a GP who said he thought Brandy's leukaemia had come back. He told her he was calling the hospital and that she had to go there straight away.

But Ms Ramsdell knew that because of the type of cancer Brandy had, and because it had come back a second time so quickly, she only had about a 2 percent chance of surviving.

Ms Ramsdell didn't want Brandy's last months spent in a hospital ward hooked up to machines.

'The treatment's horrible, having to live there was horrible,' Ms Ramsdell said.

'I didn't want to go back to the hospital with that [survival rate] - the chemo didn't work and I didn't want to make her go through it again.'

She spoke to the Brisbane hospital on the phone and told doctors they were on their way.

'I just sort of lied and said "I'm packing now, it takes us two hours to get there",' she said.

'We did a runner like this other family.'

At first she took Brandy to a friend's house nearby but she soon realised that whoever she stayed with would be dragged into the situation so they only stayed one night.

Ms Ramsdell then went to her uncle's house in Brisbane and stayed a night, after which he drove her to her cousin's house south of the NSW border.

She stayed there a night before going back to her uncle's house in Brisbane.

After a couple of days Ms Ramsdell turned on the TV and saw her and Brandy's faces on the news and that's when she realised the scale of the police manhunt.

'I just had a gut feeling they were going to be there by 9am the next morning and they were,' she said.

Brandy died at home on August 29 2005, a month after she was discharged from hospital for the second time

'The house was surrounded by police cars, helicopters and media were blocking off the street.

'It was full on.'

Ms Ramsdell wasn't arrested but she and Brandy were taken straight to hospital and she was kept guarded by police.

'I wasn't handcuffed and I was allowed to stay with Brandy,' she said.

Child welfare officers were also involved and Brandy was made a ward of the state for 48 hours.

'I was so angry. l let them know they could have one overnight stay and one blood test and then we were leaving,' Ms Ramsdell.

'That was when I realised I was allowed to [refuse chemo], and that I shouldn't have gone on that big police chase.'

Brett and Naghmeh King were arrested in Spain but have since been released

When Brandy was allowed to leave hospital Ms Ramsdell took her home, and she spent the next few weeks on a bed in the lounge room where she was 'comfortable and warm'.

Brandy died on August 29 2005, a month after she was discharged.

Forensic police came to the house to interrogate Ms Ramsdell and they confirmed there was no foul play.

'You just answer their questions as best you can. The two detectives were really good, really respectful,' she said.

While she wishes she had never run away with Brandy, the experience has turned Ms Ramsdell off hospitals.

She also has a four-year-old daughter Pearl Possum who suffers from Edwards syndrome – a disease related to Down syndrome.

Pearl receives physiotherapy treatment and sees a paediatrician but Ms Ramsdell is reluctant for her to undergo any surgery in case it kills her.

Ms Ramsdell knows many people judged her for her decision to take Brandy away from hospital, but she says people should think before judging the King family.

'They obviously haven't been there,' she said.

'It's OK in your armchair saying that but everyone should visit a kids' cancer ward.

'See it firsthand, see what the parents and kids have to go through.

'[The Kings] are the same as me they just want the best for him.'
