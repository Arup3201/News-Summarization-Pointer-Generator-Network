A runaway emu caused traffic issues in Israel when it escaped from its farm and decided to go for a dash on the highway.

The emu was spotted running through traffic in the central Israeli town of Herzliya near Tel Aviv, Â on Sunday.

Passer-by Iliya Zelser filmed the bird's run, describing the  experience as if he was in a cartoon.

Mr Zelser, 27, says he expected to hear the 'beep beep' of the cartoon Road Runner.

'I said to myself in a second, a coyote will appear from behind,' Mr Zelser added.

'This was a really absurd situation.'

Dorit Basman, the spokeswoman for the town of Herzliya, says authorities caught the emu Sunday and safely returned it to its owner.
