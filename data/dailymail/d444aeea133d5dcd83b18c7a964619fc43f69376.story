Time for ban number 45: John Moir, 47, was convicted of driving whilst disqualified, but escaped jail

One of Britain's worst drivers, whose carelessness behind the wheel almost killed a man, has walked free from court after breaking a driving ban for the 44th time.

John Moir, 47, was caught behind the wheel by officers despite his string of previous convictions and bans.

But the serial criminal, whose recklessness on the roads left one of his victims in a coma, was given only a suspended sentence for his latest offence.

Moir, also a convicted thief, has previously said that nothing will stop him driving while disqualified, enraging safety-campaigners and his victim, who was given life-changing injuries and can no longer work.

Simon Jacobs, 46, was run down by Moir in 2010 as he walked home from playing snooker. As Moir sped away, Mr Jacobs was left in the road with a fractured skull and eye sockets and a broken nose. An ear was torn from his head.

Doctors told Mr Jacobs's family that he might die of his wounds, and the former electrician can no longer drive and will never work again.

In the wake of his accident he warned that the law needed to be tougher for serial offenders like Moir - whom he warned will eventually kill somebody.

Mr Jacobs said: 'I was lucky, but next time things could be very different. He has left me with a life sentence - I will never get over my injuries.

'When he ran into me he got 18 months, but only served half. It is an absolute insult. The justice system needs to listen up, they are playing a waiting game - eventually I believe he will kill someone.'

Victim: Simon Jacobs, who was run down in 2010, has warned that Moir will kill somebody unless he is jailed

For his latest transgression, Moir was given a 16-week suspended prison sentence at Ipswich Magistrates' Court. He was also ordered to do 240 hours of unpaid work, and he was banned from driving for a 45th time, this time until October 2016.

Moir has no racked up more than 220 offences in total, including resisting arrest and 77 counts of theft.

Defence lawyers in his latest hearing claimed Moir was 'remorseful' for his crimes, to which he pleaded guilty. But he has previously described his constant flouring of driving bans as 'a game of cat and mouse' with police and has claimed 'going to prison won't stop me'.

Magistrates heard how Moir was caught by plain-clothes officers when they tailed Moirâ€™s Vauxhall Astra in March.

He repeatedly locked his brakes and almost lost control on 
bends as he drove towards Cratfield in Suffolk. The court also heard he hit 50mph in a 30mph zone.

 Hullock, defending, said his then girlfriend had been driving, but got 
upset after getting lost, at which point Moir decided she could not 
continue driving and took over himself.

He
 jumped into the passenger seat when stopped by the pursuing cops in a 
desperate bid to escape justice but was immediately arrested.

Miss Hullock said he was 'remorseful' and realised that what he did was 'unacceptable'.

He was also warned that if he drives again he will probably be jailed.

Road safety campaigners have said harsher laws are needed to crack down on repeat offenders like Moir.

A spokesman for the charity Brake said: 'Drivers who flout bans are making a mockery of the justice system.

'We need the government to get tough with serial offenders by giving judges the power to hand out higher sentences for those who are repeatedly caught driving while disqualified.'
