Property rent in one Californian city shot up by a staggering 20.6per cent last year, reflecting a trend across the country.

According to the real estate data firm Zillow, the average monthly fee for a rental home in tech-centric Oakland is now $2,369.

Overall, analysts found that U.S. rental prices were  3.3 per cent higher in December compared to the previous year.

Lakewood in Colorado is another city where residents have felt the hike, with monthly rentals jumping 15per cent to an average of $1,770.

Experts say that because fewer Americans can afford to buy a home, demand for apartments and rental houses has pushed up prices.

The share of Americans who own their homes has slipped to 64.4 percent from a peak of 69.2 percent in 2004.

This is attributed to the housing market crash that triggered the Great Recession in late 2007

'We do not have the affordable rental housing resources to meet the demand,' said Barry Zigas, director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America, at an industry conference this week.

Rental prices have risen 52per cent since 2000, while incomes for renters have only increased 25 percent, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow. 

The higher costs make it difficult for renters to save for a down payment, which then causes them to rent for a longer period of time and delay any potential home purchases.

'You don’t have to be a housing economist to see that there is a problem there,' Humphries said.

Additional construction has yet to significantly limit price growth nationwide. 

Builders broke ground on 376,000 apartment complexes last year, a 10.2per cent increase from 2013, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. 

By contrast, single-family house construction rose just 1.4per cent last year.

Rents jumped 15.4per cent in the San Francisco area to a median monthly cost of $3,031, an increased mirrored by San Jose where prices were up 14.5per cent to $3,187 a month. 

Rents climbed 10.5per cent in Denver to $1,817 a month. Kansas City also notched a substantial 8.5per cent gain to $1,204 a month.

Still, tenants are catching a break elsewhere. 

In Chicago, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, rents rose by less than 2.2per cent. Rents in Minnesota’s Twin Cities area ticked up a mere 0.1per cent this past year to $1,501.
