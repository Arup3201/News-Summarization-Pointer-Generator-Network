Social services and mental health workers made 'serious and cumulative failings' that contributed to the deaths of two children who were killed by their mentally-ill mother, a coroner ruled today.

Paranoid schizophrenic Vivian Gamor killed ten-year-old Antoine Gamor-Ogunkoya and his sister Kenniece, three, when the children were allowed to stay with her unsupervised overnight in January 2007.

She was allowed to have the children without supervision on three separate visits and on the third bludgeoned 
Antoine to death with a hammer and suffocated Kenniece with cling film 
at her flat in Pembury Close, Hackney, east London.

Assistant Deputy Coroner for Inner London North Selena Lynch said today their mother probably would not have been given unsupervised access if the risks to the children had been 'properly recognised and managed'.

The inquest heard social services told the children's father Gabriel 'Jimi' Ogunkoya there was nothing he could do to stop Gamor seeing them.

This was despite her having been sectioned under the Mental Health Act in the past for threatening a relative with a knife and believing her children had been swapped at birth.

She also had not had contact with the pair for several months before she asked to see them.

Loving father Mr Ogunkoya told the inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court last month he was told he could not stop contact between the children and Gamor, who had parental responsibility.

He said he had told social worker 
Catherine Edwards that his former partner had requested overnight 
contact with the children after one brief supervised day visit and was not comfortable with increased access.

He said: 'Catherine Edwards told me that
there is nothing to stop her from seeing the children as I don't have 
parental responsibility. I didn't have a leg to stand on.'

He said he was getting advice 
from lawyers about seeking parental responsibility at the time but 
allowed two overnight visits which seemed to have gone well.

However, Gamor killed the children on the third.

The court heard that the couple's 
relationship deteriorated around 2002 and two years later she started 
denying the two children were hers.

By January 2006, Mr Ogunkoya was in contact with social services and Gamor had stopped seeing the children.

Gamor, a paranoid schizophrenic, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after threatening a relative with a knife in 2006, when a referral was made to Hackney Social Services.

But
after her condition apparently improved, she was allowed unsupervised 
access to her children, who were in the care of Mr Ogunkoya.

Mrs Lynch said their father was not told there was any risk to his children.

She said: 'The children wanted
to see their mother, and the father was led to believe that he could 
not prevent the mother from having contact.

'He
was not made aware that there was any risk to the children. In the 
absence of any word from social services, the parents made their own 
arrangements for contact.

'When
mental health and social services learned that further contact had 
taken place without their supervision, they acquiesced in the 
arrangement, and social services decided to close the file and take no 
further part in safeguarding the children.'

After the short period of supervised contact, there was a total failure to carry out any risk assessment, the coroner said.

An inquiry was launched when Gamor was detained indefinitely after admitting two counts of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in August 2007.

The coroner said that Mr Ogunkoya was a loving father and was not to blame for what happened to his children.

'I hope he is able to make a good life for himself notwithstanding the terrible and enduring grief he must suffer,' she added.

In her narrative conclusions, she said the mother had delusions about her children, believing they had been swapped for her children who were stillborn.

'She was prescribed medication but had probably stopped taking it for some days prior to the killings,' the coroner said.

Mrs Lynch said 'insufficient thought' had been given to the possibility that Gamor's condition was not fully controlled or that she may relapse.

She said: 'There were serious and cumulative failures by social service and mental health workers to collaborate and liaise with each other, to fully share or request information from the other, and to inform and support the father.

'Mental health services focused on the mother's condition and failed to assess the risk she might pose to the children.

'Social workers failed to carry out important tasks in a timely fashion or at all, partly because they had too much to do and were not adequately supported.

'Their managers failed to supervise or manage them in spite of obvious performance issues, poor working relationships, and staff absences and shortages.'

The coroner said that because of various changes which have been made since, she would not be making any report to the authorities.

Alan Wood, director of children's services at Hackney Council, said the deaths were a 'terrible tragedy'.

He said: 'Our heartfelt condolences go out to Mr Ogunkoya and his family.

'As the coroner has identified, the social work service for children in Hackney has been transformed over the last six years. We can never be complacent about our work to keep children safe and our social workers have studied carefully the issues in this tragic case.

'In close partnership with colleagues in other services, we continue our vigilance to ensure we are together doing all that we possibly can to keep children safe.'

Dr Robert Dolan, chief executive, East London NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We offer our deepest and most sincere condolences to the children's father, grandparents and other family members.

'We have worked very closely with our partners in the local authority, community services and the police to strengthen and improve our care and management of the whole family when the person with a mental illness is also a parent.'

He said training is now mandatory to all staff that emphasise the importance of assessing needs to all children whose parent has a mental illness, even if they are not living together.

He added: 'Following this incident, the National Patient Safety Agency issued guidance to all NHS trusts which has been embedded in our training.

'The Trust acknowledges that people with mental health problems should not be denied a relationship with their children. We recognise that they may pose a risk of emotional or physical harm to their children and this risk needs to be assessed and managed appropriately.

'Since 2007, we have reviewed and improved practice in all our community mental health teams across the Trust and will continue to prioritise the needs of the whole family, including children.'
