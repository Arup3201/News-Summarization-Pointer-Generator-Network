The BBC and BT Sport were quite the bosom buddies over the weekend.

Not only did they begin to share the load in covering the BDO World Darts Championship from Lakeside. They also teamed up to deliver a wealth of live FA Cup third-round action. From Salford to Stratford, it was cuddles all around.

Sunday was the big day for their coverage, delivering three games in a row. This was teed off on Saturday evening, at peak time no less, on BBC1 as the Pointless set was turfed over to delivered an FA Cup celebrity special. Now I'm not sure if host Alexander Armstrong was necessarily engrossed by the idea? Strikes me as more of a rugger man?

But his 'pointless friend' Richard Osman certainly was. Wearing a Motty-style sheepskin and Fulham scarf, he was revelling in the opportunity to mix it with the likes of Trevor Sinclair, Jermaine Jenas and Mark Chapman. Although he saved his best for Robbie Savage, who he gave as good a kicking as the former Welsh midfielder had ever dished out on the field of play.

But Robbie was clearly up for the challenge.

And when he identified Alfred Hitchcock as a famous West Ham fan, the blonde bombshell jumped around the set like he'd just scored the winner at Wembley.

Gary Lineker, however, may not have been so chuffed. Even though he did get to read out a question from the Match of The Day set, he was surely just a little miffed when the likes of Dumbo, Spock and Van Gogh were answers in the category 'famous ears', but he wasn't?

If Gary was disappointed, he wasn't letting it show when we next saw him at the Emirates to oversee the rematch of last year's Cup final between Arsenal and Hull City. Now earlier in the day, Jake Humphrey was boots on the ground, not afraid to get a little touchline on his loafers for BT's coverage of Manchester United's trip to Yeovil. This tactile approach is very much the house style, and it certainly helped underline the nature of Goliath's trip to David's back yard.

The Emirates, though, is no Huish Park and Gary was warmly ensconced in a studio up in the stands with his guests Alan Shearer and Jimmy Bullard. Now I'm sure Gary and Al wouldn't have minded a bit of fresh air. But I don't think Jimmy would have been quite so keen. He came dressed as if he had just walked out of Stringfellows...in about 1989!

With his long hair gelled back, and sporting a black tuxedo jacket with a black silk shirt unbuttoned to reveal a silver necklace, I think it is safe to say that Jimmy has decided to make up for all that lost time he'd spent wearing a sweaty vest and shorts in the jungle. Like some kind of old football pros version of Zoolander, it would appear Robbie might have himself a rival on the pundit catwalk.

Come Monday night, and I must confess to being somewhat surprised to see the Match of the Day team, once again, doing their thing from inside a studio at the ground. The 1988 Cup final rematch felt like the dream tie of the round. And the old Kingsmeadow stadium looked the ideal setting for Gary to go and get some grass on his Guccis? But perhaps it has just been decided by the powers-that-be that pitchside is just a bit too BT and ITV?

Instead, it was down to Mark Chapman to get in amongst it. Accompanied by the panto-style cheers, boos, oohs and aahs of a group of watching Wimbledon fans, Chappers was in the club bar to bring us the fourth round. And some may say that's the first time those words have ever appeared alongside each other!

This was an intimate, down-to-earth, grass roots reminder of what is meant by the magic of the Cup. As indeed was a superb game of knockout football under the lights. In which a certain Steven Gerrard was the fundamental difference.

A fact that wasn't wasted on Alan Shearer who chose the occasion to basically lay into Liverpool with as much venom as Osman had on Savage, on Saturday night. 'His head has not been turned by the lure of the MLS', snarled Shearer before the game. 'If they wanted him badly enough, they'd have kept him'. He then went on to hijack the post match analysis from a rather startled-looking Dave Beasant, to once again point out that the club had let their long-serving captain down.

Anyone else get the feeling that Shearer reckons Liverpool's decision-making about Gerrard's future was pointless?
