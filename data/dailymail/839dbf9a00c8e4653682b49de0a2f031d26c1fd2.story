A brain-damaged father who was left to lay in urine-soaked sheets and covered in faeces in a NHS hospital in an 'appalling' case of neglect that was secretly filmed by his family.

Grant Clarke's wife Binny used a camera hidden in an iPod connector to record what happened while she was not there after he said he was being mistreated by carers.

The 43-year-old was left permanently paralysed down the left hand side of his body after suffering a massive brain haemorrhage.

Binny was devastated to discover the 'appalling' treatment he was receiving when she played back the film.

It showed him being left for hours lying in his own urine and his bell being ripped from his hand so he was left unable to call for help.

It also revealed a nurse cleaning his feeding tube with a pen while he helplessly watched and staff giving him drinks - despite being strictly instructed to keep Grant on a nil by mouth diet.

Mr Clarke, the director of an IT company, suffered a severe brain haemorrhage in May last year when he collapsed at work.

He was treated at two major hospitals before being sent to West Kent Neuro-rehabilitation Unit at Sevenoaks Hospital in Kent.

But it was there that he allegedly suffered the neglect, and his family became deeply worried about him. 

His partner Binny, 42, said: 'He became depressed and his mood got lower and lower. He became a completely different person and was in an absolute mess.

'We would visit him and he would smell mouldy and of urine because they were not cleaning him.

'He was left in his own urine and faeces, it was very distressing.

She claimed staff failed several times to help him visit the toilet and eventually she decided to secretly film him after she discovered him sobbing about his alleged treatment.

Mrs Clarke, a mother-of-three, installed a secret camera and filmed his treatment over ten days - and was appalled at the results.

She said: 'You can see a nurse cleaning his feeding tube by digging around with a pen, you see a nurse give him water when he's strictly on a nil-by-mouth diet.

Mr Grant was only switched to another unit after his family showed the film to police and he was moved under a court order

'They leave him in his own urine, no one brushes his teeth. It was so upsetting to watch.

'He didn't have a shower there for six weeks when he was there, there was no social interaction for him.'

Grant spent four months at the hospital and Mrs Clark said she raised her concerns a number of times during his stay - but claims no one responded to her and acted on her requests.

His mother Maureen, 71, said: 'You never picture this happening to anyone you know - especially my own strapping son.'

Mrs Clarke, a former nurse from Eltham, south-east London, said: 'When we visited, he would be up to his armpits in urine.

'He would write on his lightwriter: "I’m dying here."'

She said: 'I felt sick when I saw him being given water because he’s ‘nil by mouth.’ He could have choked.

'His call bell was taken away three times for between ten and 16 minutes.'

She added: 'It turns out only one member of staff had specific training on brain injuries.'

Mr
 Grant, a father-of-three from West Kingsdown, Kent, was only switched 
to another unit after his family showed the film to police and he was 
moved under a court order.

Mr Grant's family has now made 26 complaints to Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, which manages the unit. Twenty-two have been upheld.

A spokesman for Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said: 'We remain appalled at what happened.

'When the patient’s family made a complaint in November last year, we immediately suspended three members of staff pending detailed investigations, notified all relevant authorities, met with the family and watched their footage.

'We subsequently created a robust action plan to address all concerns and the trust has met with the patient’s family on several occasions.

'Of the three members of staff suspended, one was subject to disciplinary action and has already left the trust.

'One went through disciplinary action and is now working under supervision, and one is still subject to ongoing proceedings.

'This September the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found the unit to be fully compliant with their standards with very positive feedback from the current patients on the unit.'

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Kent Police was contacted in November 2012 by a woman concerned about the level of care offered to a 43 year-old patient in West Kent Neuro-rehabilitation Unit at Sevenoaks Hospital.

'Kent Police carried out an investigation which was concluded in March 2013. 

'We are satisfied that no criminal offences had taken place.
