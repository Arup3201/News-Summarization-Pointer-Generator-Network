A 10-year-old boy from Pennsylvania has been charged as an adult in the beating death of a 90-year-old woman who was in the care of his grandfather. 

Prosecutors in Wayne County said the boy, Tristen Kurilla, was visiting his grandfather, Anthony Virbitsky, in Tyler Hill Saturday, when county emergency responders got a call reporting the death of an elderly woman who has been in his care, Helen Novak.

District Attorney Janine Edwards said in a statement that Kurilla's mother, Martha Virbitsky, brought him in to the state police barracks at Honesdale the same afternoon and reported that her son had told her that he had gone into the woman's room and she yelled at him.

'Pint-size killer': Tristen Kurilla, 10, pictured left and right with his mother, has been charged as an adult in the death of 90-year-old Helen Novak, whom he allegedly hooked by the neck with her cane 

Crime scene: Helen Novak was killed inside her caretaker's home in Damascus Township, Pennsylvania

Tristen told his mother 'he got mad, lost his temper and grabbed a cane and put it around Novak's throat,' police said. 

Advised of his rights and interviewed by a trooper, he said he 'pulled Novak down on the bed and held the cane on her throat and then punched her numerous times,' authorities said.

State police said the 10-year-old told them that he went to his grandfather and told him that the woman was 'bleeding from her mouth' but denied he had harmed her, but later told him that he had punched the woman and put a cane around her neck.

Police said an autopsy performed Monday at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Honesdale indicated blunt force trauma to the victim's neck, and the death was ruled a homicide. 

Dr. Gary Ross also said the boy's account to police 'was consistent with the injuries he observed.'

Tristen was charged as an adult with criminal homicide and aggravated assault, with the prosecutor's office noting that the crime of homicide 'is specifically excluded from the juvenile act' and therefore 'a juvenile who commits the crime of homicide is charged as an adult.'

Tristen Kurilla was visiting his grandfather at his home in the 340 block of Sky Lake Road in Damascus Township when at around 10am Saturday he entered the room of Helen Novak to ask her a question, police stated.

According to the child, the elderly woman yelled at him and ordered him to leave, reported The Times-Tribune.

The 10-year-old became upset at the woman's reaction, grabbed a wooden cane, came up behind her and hooked it around her neck, using the staff to pull her backwards unto the bed, police said.

Anthony Virbitsky, 69, Tristen’s grandfather who has been looking after Ms Novak, went into her room at around 10.30am and found her breathing heavy and looking terrified.

About 30 minutes later, the caretaker checked up on her again and found the 90-year-old unresponsive.

When interviewed by police Saturday, Tristen Kurilla reportedly told a trooper: 'I killed that lady.'

Confession: The boy allegedly told police he 'killed that lady,' even though he was only 'trying to hurt her'

The 10-year-old boy reportedly described how he pushed the cane into Novak's throat for several seconds and then punched her five times in the throat and the stomach.

‘I was only trying to hurt her,’ Kurilla allegedly told detectives.

According to court documents cited by WFMZ, the boy's mother, Martha Virbitsky, told police she ‘has had a lot of trouble with Tristen and that he has had some mental difficulties.’

Kurilla is being held without bail pending an October 22 preliminary hearing.
