Donald Sterling is currently preparing to duke it out with the NBA to keep his Los Angeles Clippers team, but he may also soon face another legal issue - this time from the IRS.

That's because Sterling's mother and grandmother have been paying property taxes on two LA residences since 2001, even though both have been dead for decades.

A new report in  USA Today suggests 80-year-old Sterling and his sister Marilyn Pizante, 73, have kept their childhood home and a property across the street in their mother and grandmother's names and have avoided a reassessment that would increase their property taxes by several thousand dollars.

A new report by USA Today finds that two property's in Donald Sterling's old neighborhood - including his childhood home - are in the name of his mother and grandmother, women who have been dead for decades

Sterling's mother Sora Tokowitz gained ownership of the two properties in her divorce from Sterling's father Louis Tokowitz in 1959, and went on to live in one of the properties for 30 years as landlady.

It's unclear how, but at some point Sterling's paternal grandmother Sarah Chasa Tokovitz became the legal owner of the childhood home, though no tenants recognize her name.

Sterling's mother died sometime in the 80s while his grandmother died in 1966 in Chicago.

According to California law, both women's deaths should have been reported to the LA County Assessor's Office within 150 days, so that the properties could be reassessed for market value and mostly likely, a tax increase instated.

Sterling's mother Sora Tokowitz is still the registered owner on this multi-tenant building located just across the street. However, she died sometime in the 1980s

But neither death seems to have been reported since both properties are still in the deceased women's names.

In 2013, $603.66 was paid in property taxes on Sterling's childhood home while $1,545.11 was paid on the property across the street in his mother's name.

Neither property has been reassessed since 1978 and would be worth today a combined $13,000 in property taxes. Since 2001, LA County has received 49 money orders in either women's names, paying these property taxes.

Sterling is worth an estimated $1.9billion according to Forbes and owns hundreds of properties in the Los Angeles area, from low-income apartments to the lux Sterling Plaza in Beverly Hills.

He made headlines last month when the NBA banned him from the league for life and hit him with a $2.5 million fine for making racist comments in recordings reportedly released by then-girlfriend V. Stiviano. They are also trying to force him to sell the team.

But most tenants at the facility remember dealing with Sterling's mother and sister as their landladies over the years.

Sterling's mother Sora was so beloved by her tenants that they let her eat their food.

That changed with Sora's death in the '80s, when Marilyn Pizante showed up claiming the two properties were hers now.

The Navarette family, who lived at one of the properties for 30 years, was evicted in 2005 and went to court with Pizante.

While most tenants remember either Sora or her daughter Pizante as their landlady, Donald Sterling himself was caught on the properties a few times.

Danny Vallejo, Maria Vallejo's son, remembers a day in May 2012 when Donald and a woman he now recognizes as girlfriend V. Stiviano were taking pictures of the newly-painted properties.

At one point, Sterling tried to open the gate into the backyard but Stiviano stopped him.

'No, no, honey, you can't go in there. You need a permit,' Stiviano said. 

'She just hugged him and kissed him... I could hear everything,' Danny recalls.

Shortly after Sterling's visit, a for-sale sign popped up on the front lawn of own of the properties but was soon inexplicably removed.
