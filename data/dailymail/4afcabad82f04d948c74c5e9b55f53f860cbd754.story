A generous businessman, who has anonymously paid for more than 50 funerals, now hopes he can offer what he calls the 'final, ultimate respect' to a grieving family who lost a mother and her two young sons in a freak accident. 

The man, from Montgomery County, Maryland, has reached out to the family of Marie Gemmell who was killed  along with her three-year-old Cole and one-month-old Devin on December 8 when a jet crashed into their Gaithersburg home.

Three men on board the business jet also died when it crashed into the neighborhood near an airport.

A fundraising campaign on GoFundMe has raised close to $500,000 for widower, Ken Gemmell, and his school-aged daughter, Arabelle.

Mr Gemmell and his daughter weren't home when the private jet crashed last month, sending a wing catapulting into the house and erupting into flames.

The anonymous businessman recently told Fox that he 'hopes and prays' that they will take him up on his offer and put the other money aside for his daughter's future and college education. 

The generous donor has also stepped in to ease the financial burden for other families in tragic circumstances. 

He paid for the funeral of Michelle Dorr, a six-year-old who was murdered in 1986 in Maryland and whose remains were finally found in 2000.  

Michelle's father told Fox that the Good Samaritan had come to him and offered to pay for his daughter's funeral 'at his most vulnerable time and when he most needed it'. 

Another recipient of the businessman's generosity was Jeni Stepanek. 

He paid for the funeral of her son Mattie, a renowned poet and peace activist, who counted Jimmy Carter and Oprah Winfrey as friends 

The businessman (pictured left) has refused to reveal his identity. He has paid for more than 50 funerals including that of JeniStepanek's (pictured) son Mattie. Ms Stepanek called the man 'an angel on earth'

Mattie died, aged 13, in 2004 from complications related to his rare form of muscular dystrophy.

Ms Stepanek also lost her three other children, Katie, Stevie and Jamie to the disease and battles the condition herself which has left her in a wheelchair and permanently attached to a ventilator. 

Thousands attended Mattie's funeral which was attended by both former President Carter and Oprah.  

She described the man who paid for Mattie's funeral as an 'angel on earth'. 

But according to the businessman, he is just giving back to his community for his own good fortune. 

He told Fox: 'I think it is very important not to forget where you came from. I came from absolute poverty and God has blessed me.'
