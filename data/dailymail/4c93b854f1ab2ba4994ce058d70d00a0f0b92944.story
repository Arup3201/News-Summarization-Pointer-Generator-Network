Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis has confirmed his interest in Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini.

Although, the club's valuation of the player and his wages have proved to be a stumbling block for the Serie A side so far.

'Fellaini is one of the names of our midfield, but he's not the only one,' he told Radio Kiss Kiss.

Major signing: Former United boss David Moyes paid £27.5m for the then Everton midfielder Fellaini

'His hairstyle could be perfect for the Neapolitan style. I like his "lion-hair", I have introduced Inler like a lion, Fellaini could compensate his lack of hair.'

'They would make a nice pair,' said the Napoli president, who bizarrely made Inler wear a lion's mask at his unveiling in 2011.

'Fellaini has long hair, and the Swiss (Inler) is shaven.

'Together they have a hairstyle that looks like a lion's mane and three years ago I presented Inler with the mask of a lion!'

Fellaini is yet to meet new boss Louis van Gaal as he was given an extended break due to his exploits at the World Cup with Belgium. 

However Van Gaal has reportedly already made his mind up on the former Everton man and is willing to cash in on Fellaini.
