Creepy: Massachusetts funeral home director Joseph O'Donnell allegedly stashed several bodies and remains in two area storage units

The bodies of 12 people along with the cremated remains of 40 deceased and one dog have been discovered in storage units allegedly connected to a rogue funeral director.

The gruesome discoveries emerged on Thursday after authorities spent months investigating Massachusetts  funeral home director Joseph O’Donnell.

The bodies were kept at a storage unit in Weymouth while individually packaged remains were found at a location in Somerville. 

The Suffolk District Attorney's office is now talking with families to try to identify the remains, The Boston Herald reported.

O'Donnell, 55, was arrested in April for allegedly scamming an elderly couple out of $12,000 in burial expenses then keeping the money when he went out of business.

O'Donnell had also been under investigation by state authorities who suspected he'd been operating from his home unlicensed for six years.

Police 
investigating charges against O'Donnell, who remains jailed on larceny 
charges, discovered on Wednesday the human remains in a 
Somerville storage facility reportedly connected to 
O'Donnell, reported WCVB.

On Thursday, police investigating another storage unit in Weymouth found the bodies of several adult humans.

'While
 executing this search warrant, detectives observed what appeared to be 
human remains. They suspended their search and notified the Norfolk DA’s
 office and Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,' Suffolk County 
District Attorney said in a statement.

Investigators on Thursday removed at least 12 bodies from a storage unit in Weymouth, Massachusetts allegedly connected to rogue funeral director Joseph O'Donnell

Footage
 from the investigation on Thursday showed authorities removing from the 
facility at least three caskets.

O’Donnell
 is due back in court on Friday, reported the Boston Globe. He has been held on $10,000 bail after pleading not guilty in April to stealing the elderly couple's funeral expenses. He is now likely to face further charges.

'Our
 top priority right now is determining the identity of the remains we’ve
 discovered,' DA Daniel Conley said Thursday.

'We’ve seized records and 
documents that could help us locate those people’s families, but this 
will be a time- and labor-intensive task.'

Prosecutors
 said no foul play is suspected in the deaths and they are working with 
state medical examiner to identify the remains.
