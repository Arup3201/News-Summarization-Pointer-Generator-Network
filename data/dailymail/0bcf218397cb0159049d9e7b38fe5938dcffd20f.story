Last week a video of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain mimicking Daniel Sturridge’s notorious goal celebration surfaced on the FA’s World Cup website.

Soon enough, when the tournament gets under way in Brazil, Sturridge will be hoping to show the world how it really should be done.

‘In a World Cup, if I was to score a goal... if I can score one goal I would be happy because I have come a long way,’ he admitted.

There is a maturity about Sturridge, a growing sense of belonging at the highest level of the game after an outstanding season with Liverpool. After their final fixture, when his attention turned to the World Cup, Sturridge was flicking through the record books when he came across the name of an England great.

‘I looked at Gary Lineker’s stats and he scored 10 goals in the World Cup. I thought, “Wow, that’s a huge task for anyone to get anywhere near that”.’

Lineker’s name conjures images of his goals at the Mexico World Cup, when he wore a plaster cast on his left wrist as England progressed to the quarter-final. Four years later Lineker scored four at Italia 90 before the heartbreak of defeat against West Germany in the semi-final.

‘When I look at that, 10 goals in two World Cups that he played in, that is incredible. If I can score even one goal I’d be happy because I have come a long way.’

It has all fallen into place for the Liverpool striker, a key part of Roy Hodgson’s World Cup plans as they prepare for their opening game with Italy on June 14. He hopes to hit the bullseye.

‘Somebody can say, “I’m going to win this game of darts”, but when they play they might not win,’ he added. ‘It’s easy to say when you’re going to do it, but more difficult to do it. I’m thankful to God for allowing me to have a decent season. The World Cup is a different level of football to the Premier League.

‘You have to understand it’s everyone’s dream to play in a World Cup as a kid. I’m just excited about it.’

He has every right to be optimistic. This season, with the backing of his Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, he scored 21 times in the Barclays Premier League.

It has forced Hodgson’s hand, right at the front of the queue for a place in  England’s forward line. He is flourishing at every level.

‘I’ve just been given the opportunity and that’s what I’ve asked for in the past,’ he added. ‘I don’t think the manager needs to give me a confidence booster and say, “You are my main man, you are the best”.

‘Everyone wants to play. Even if you’re 15 and in the youth team you believe you’re good enough to play in the first team.’

He has taken the long way round to international football, finally establishing himself as a regular international under Hodgson.

There was frustration at Manchester City and Chelsea before he finally found a manager who truly believed in his goalscoring instincts. Rodgers cherishes him.

‘It’s down to the clubs which players 
they want to give a chance to and the philosophies they choose,’ he 
added. ‘I can’t speak for Chelsea or City and say they are wrong. When 
you’ve money to spend it’s very easy to buy someone worth £50m rather 
than say, “I’ll play this 20-year-old English player”.

‘You can only roll the dice and see how they perform. I’m thankful for everything that happened at those previous clubs. City put me on the map in terms of giving me a chance to play in the first-team environment and Chelsea also helped me to improve mentally and as a footballer. I won trophies there. Sometimes people change clubs. I would never regret anything.’

Everything has happened so quickly since the end of the season that Sturridge hasn’t had time to dwell on the title race. He has ‘boxed it off’, in his words, putting it to one side until he gets a chance to reflect on it after the World Cup.

‘You’ve got to move on. It wasn’t a 
great feeling, but we set ourselves the target of getting into the 
Champions League, so everybody’s content. But sometimes you get so 
close, feel like you’ve almost won it and then don’t achieve that, it’s 
disappointing.

‘It’s about moving forward, performing at the World Cup and enjoying it. There’s no favourite at the World Cup — people didn’t expect Liverpool to qualify for the Champions League.’

Even though they were eventually beaten to the Premier League title by City, Sturridge’s partnership with Luis Suarez flourished. The Uruguayan, who still hopes to face England in Sao Paulo on June 19 despite a knee injury, scored 31 times in the league.

There are those who believe Sturridge 
is very much the junior partner in that Liverpool forward line, but he 
has had a remarkable season.

‘If Luis is world class, Luis is world class,’ added Sturridge. ‘That’s everyone’s opinion and that’s how they feel. Everyone is entitled to their opinion.

‘For me I am just working every day on the training field the same way that Luis works. We work to reach the optimum level our bodies can reach. At the end of the day I am happy performing the way I am performing. I am working harder to improve even more and that’s the most important thing for me.

‘Everyone has their own opinions on what footballers they like. I like Ronaldo, some people like Messi. It is down to individual preferences.’
