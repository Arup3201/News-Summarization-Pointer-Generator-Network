An hilarious YouTube video purporting to be a reference to support a job application for DreamWorks Pictures features 'CJ' in a convincing appeal for employment - even Steven Spielberg is apparently on his side.

The video begins with a written explanation: 'In 2011, CJ applied for a job at DreamWorks. He sent in this video.' CJ wants to be a post-production production assistant at DreamWorks, and he believes he's got the chops for the job.

But don't take his word for it - Steven Spielberg has a few things to say on his behalf.

Living the dream: Christopher Woodring showed off his production skills by cleverly editing an old interview to make it look like he and Steven Spielberg had an intimate tete-a-tete regarding Woodring's job prospects

In a cleverly spliced old interview with Spielberg, CJ, who identifies himself as Christopher Woodring, extracts some high praise from the director, screenwriter, producer - and co-founder of DreamWorks movie studios.

'Why, hello there Steven Spielberg,' he says, glancing meaningfully at the camera.

'You look great, by the way... You haven't aged a day since 1993,' in reference to the interview footage, which appears to be an old BBC Face to Face interview from around the time of the release of Spielberg's acclaimed Schindler's List in 1993.

CJ asks Spielberg if he could endorse him for a job at DreamWorks, to which Spielberg responds, 'I can. And I can without shame.'

Aged well: It's unclear if Spielberg has seen the video, which uses an old BBC interview from 1993, but according to the video's conclusion, Woodring has been banned from working at DreamWorks

In response to CJ's question about his best qualities, Spielberg decides it's CJ's 'wondrous eyes', and the 'energy of Helen Hayes when she was in her 70s', referring to the American actress dubbed the First Lady of American Theater.

'That's a strange example,' say CJ. 'But yes, I have infectious energy, I'm kind of always working hard,' he concedes.

When it comes to thinking of CJ's worst, Spielberg appears stumped. 'Take your time,' CJ encourages him gently. He can't come up with anything, so they move onto their friendship.

Job seeker: CJ has not been successful in his bid for a job at Dreamworks so far, but the company has remained silent on whether or not Spielberg cried

'We went out together, we went to each
other's houses together, we complain together- ' begins Spielberg. 
'Mostly about George,' interjects CJ, referring to Spielberg's rival 
George Lukas.

'Of course,' grins Spielberg.

The
final part of the interview moves to a more emotional plane, as 
Spielberg discusses his fear that CJ won't come and work at Dreamworks. 
'Steven, if I don't come and work for you, will you cry?' asks CJ.

'Yes,' replies Spielberg softly, appearing to hold back deep emotion.

To uplifting music, CJ appears with a glass of wine raised to the camera and text across the screen exhorts Dreamworks:

'Hire Christopher Woodring as Post Production Assistant. Steven Spielberg will cry if you don't.'

Incredibly, even after the amazing reference of Steven Spielberg and those wondrous eyes, it appears CJ has not been hired by Dreamworks.

Perhaps he should put some feelers out to George Lukas.
