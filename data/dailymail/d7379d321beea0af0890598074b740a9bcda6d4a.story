Misconduct: Dr Ruth Coppard, pictured arriving at an earlier hearing, tried to block a father's bid for custody of his daughter by falsely stating he had autism

A child psychologist who has featured as an expert on BBC’s Woman’s Hour tried to stop a father winning custody of his teenage daughter by falsely claiming he was autistic, a disciplinary panel was told yesterday.

Dr Ruth Coppard told officers involved in family court proceedings that Ian Watson had Asperger’s syndrome, despite having no evidence to back the claim.

As well as Radio 4, Coppard has appeared on the Richard and Judy show and featured in other media.

She was found guilty of misconduct by the Health Professions Council in London yesterday after six out of seven allegations against her were found proved.

The panel also ruled that her fitness to practice was impaired.

The allegations included informing a family court officer that Mr Watson had Asperger’s syndrome – a form of autism – ‘without providing any evidence to substantiate your conclusion’.

Coppard, an NHS psychologist who is based in Barnsley, had also diagnosed the teenage girl as having the same autistic spectrum disorder.

She made damaging comments about them both in a report commissioned by Mr Watson’s ex-wife in November 2008 and a second report for the family GP four months later.

Coppard admitted she ‘crossed the line’ by helping Mr Watson’s former wife and taking her side in the custody dispute.

She told the hearing: ‘I may have been seduced by the mother’s request, but I really believed it was important for people to understand the extent of her difficulties.’

Mr Watson said he had attended treatment sessions with his ex-wife and daughter but had never himself been assessed for any condition.

He claimed Coppard’s report misused confidential information, which left his daughter feeling ‘cross and emotional’. ‘I don’t believe at any time in her life she’s going to have the confidence to talk about her feelings with anyone like that again,’ he said.

‘I went there in good faith and revealed my thoughts and feelings. What I said was added to a long list of failings that were mentioned in court as evidence to why I wasn’t fit to have custody of my two children.’

Coppard made the claims about Mr Watson two years after treating his 14-year-old daughter for an eating disorder.

She even contacted the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service to make sure they took her opinions into consideration.

She admitted breaching patient confidentiality, but insisted she believed it was in the teenager’s best interests.

She conceded: ‘There are a number of things I should have done differently.’

Panel chairman Jacki Pearce said Coppard ‘conducted herself in a manner that fell short of a registered psychologist’.

She was given an 18-month condition of practice order, which means she will work under supervision and undergo training.
