Barefoot and sitting cross-legged on the floor, Samantha Cameron is listening to mothers telling stories about their children.

But in this mothers’ group, the tales are of grief, fear and terrible loss. They are some of the most shocking stories she has ever heard.

On her first solo foreign trip, the Prime Minister’s wife and mother of three travelled to Lebanon to meet families torn apart by the crisis in Syria.

Tragic stories: Samantha Cameron talks to a girl who saw her uncle being killed in the street in Syria and helped to bring his body indoors, and her aunt, who was travelling in a car out of Syria when a sniper shot at her car and killed her baby son

After visiting refugees, the woman who
 rarely makes public pronouncements warned that innocent childhoods were
 ‘being smashed to pieces’ in the conflict.

Mrs Cameron said:  ‘As a mother, it is
 horrifying to hear the harrowing stories from the children I met today.
 No child should ever experience what they have.

‘With every day that passes, more children and parents are being killed, more innocent childhoods are being smashed to pieces.’

Mrs Cameron, who has been an 
ambassador for Save the Children since 2011, visited a camp in the Bekaa
 Valley on Tuesday and spoke to women and children caught up in the 
violence.

Visibly emotional after speaking to a 
mother whose young son was killed by a sniper in front of her other six 
children, she said: ‘It’s so shocking. It’s difficult to take in.

‘Her three-year-old son was shot by a 
sniper at a checkpoint – a sniper aiming at a car full of seven 
children. I mean, it’s just … you just can’t imagine why that could 
happen.’

The grieving mother had told Mrs 
Cameron: ‘I was driving with my children, trying to escape Syria, when 
the shooting started. How can anyone shoot at a car with seven children 
in it?

'They shot my baby and he died. His 
brothers and sisters saw this happen.’  At a health clinic at the camp, 
Mrs Cameron held the hand of a little disabled boy. Because of constant 
shelling and sniper fire, his mother struggles to find healthcare for 
him.'

An estimated three million people have
 fled their homes in Syria. One million have made it to neighbouring 
countries but two million are trapped in the warzone.

Save The Children chief executive 
Justin Forsyth, who accompanied Mrs Cameron, said: ‘Samantha Cameron’s 
support helps draw attention to the plight of children caught up in this
 terrifying conflict. Without more help , and quickly, we risk losing a 
generation of Syria’s children.’

The Prince of Wales has made a significant donation to the British Red Cross Syria Crisis appeal, the organisation said today.

Charles has recently returned from a trip to the Middle East where he visited a refugee camp in Jordan which was home to hundreds of Syrians who have fled the fighting in their homeland.

The donation from the prince, who is president of the British Red Cross, will be split between the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the Jordanian Red Crescent.

Charles has also made a donation to the DEC Syria appeal to boost aid for the refugees.

A Clarence House spokeswoman said: 'Earlier this month, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall learned first-hand about the plight of Syrian refugees when they visited the King Abdullah Park refugee camp in Jordan.

'During their visit they heard directly from some of the refugees about the terrible situation in their country, and they were especially moved when told of the traumatic experiences so many children had been through before and during their flight from the conflict in Syria.'
