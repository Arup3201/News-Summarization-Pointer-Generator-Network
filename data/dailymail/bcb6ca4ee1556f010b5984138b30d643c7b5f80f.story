Astronomers are to use the distorting effects of gravity in a distant galaxy cluster as a magnifying glass to peer closer at distant galaxies than has ever been possible before.

This image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows Abell 2744, a distant region of space known as Pandora's Cluster, which is so massive that its gravity distorts space time around it.

The distortion creates a range of odd optical effects; but interestingly it also magnifies the light from even more far away objects hidden behind Abell 2744, allowing astronomers to see them in better detail.

Pandora's Cluster: The space time distortion around Abell 2744, a massive galaxy cluster created by the collision of four previously separate clusters, is helping astronomers to peer deeper into the distant cosmos

Abell 2744 is the product of the violent and simultaneous collision of four galaxy clusters over 350million years

It was first spotted by Hubble in 2011, when observations of its weird and wonderful properties promped the nickname Pandora's Cluster.

This latest long-exposure image of the cluster shows a mix of hazy elliptical galaxies and colourful spirals clumped together in the centre, Nasa explained in a statement.

The effects of the powerful gravitational field can be seen in the blue arcs and distorted images scattered across the frame, that seem to be bleeding into the surrounding space.

The arcs, Nasa says, are in fact the distorted images of galaxies even further in the distance.

Abell
 2744 is the first of six targets for an observing programme known as 
Frontier Fields, a three-year operation to probe the deepest views of 
the Universe yet seen in visible light.

It's continuing mission: Abell 2744 is the first of six targets Hubble will look at for a three-year observing programme known as Frontier Fields

In order to do this, the Hubble will exploit so-called gravitational lensing effects around its targets to peer beyond them into the unknown depths of the cosmos.

A Nasa spokesman explained: 'Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon caused by an object's influence on the space-time around it.

'Massive
 objects like galaxy clusters warp and distort this space-time. This 
causes light from more distant objects hidden behind this makeshift lens
 to be deflected and bent, leading to a bizarre array of optical effects
 — for example, it caused a cosmic space invader to appear around 
cluster Abell 68 by creating mirror images of one galaxy, as well as 
smearing galaxies out into arcs, and creating multiple images of 
individual objects.

'As well
 as creating these weird shapes, lensing also magnifies the images so 
that astronomers can see more detail. This means that distant objects 
that otherwise would be too distant and faint to be seen become visible —
 something that Frontier Fields aims to exploit over the coming years.'

The
 programme is already beginning to bear fruit. In a paper submitted to 
The Astrophysical Journal last November a group os astronomers told how 
they had detected a large number of possible galaxies through the 
gravitational lens of Abell 2744.

They found that five of these galaxy candidates are part of distant systems that appeared to have been imaged multiple times due to the cluster's gravitational effects.

Nasa's spokesman added: 'These deep surveys using massive galaxy clusters like Abell 2744 show that looking through cosmic lenses can be an effective and useful way to study the distant Universe.'

The gravity around Abell 2744 is so strong it distorts space time

This allows astronomers to use it like a magnifying glass to see beyond
