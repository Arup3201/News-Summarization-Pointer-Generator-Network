It's certainly one way to beat the predicted chaos of the capital's public transport during the summer's Games.

And at least if you do get stuck, there are the dramatic views of London's skyline - not to mention a glimpse of the Olympic stadium - to enjoy.

The cable car across the River Thames was officially launched by Boris Johnson today with just under a month to go to the Olympics.

The London Mayor was the first passenger on the £44million Emirates Air Line which offers 360-degree views of the city.

Up to 2,500 passengers an hour will be carried in each direction over the river between Greenwich Peninsula, to the south, and the Royal Docks, to the north.

Ahead of the public opening, Mr Johnson rode one of the cable cars, which will whisk passengers almost 300ft above the water.

The Mayor said: 'Get on this cable car immediately. It’s 
beautiful, worth every penny and a stunning piece of engineering.'

He added that the new system would 
provide a much-needed connection across the Thames and become 'a 
must-see destination in its own right'.

Base station: The new cable car costs adults £3.20 for a single journey on Oyster Cards, and £1.60 for children

The system is sponsored by Dubai-based airline Emirates, which has contributed £36 million to the project in a 10-year deal.

A single fare will cost £3.20 for those using Oyster cards and £1.60 for children, while adults paying by cash will have to 
fork out £4.30.

There will also be special 'frequent flyer' deals for 
regular users.

It cuts journey times to around five minutes between the O2 arena and the ExCel exhibition centre - both of which are Olympic venues.

The O2 will host events including the 
gymnastics and basketball finals, while the ExCel centre features seven 
Olympic events and six Paralympic sports.

Each car provides 360-degree views 
taking in the City, Canary Wharf, historic Greenwich, the Thames Barrier
 and the Olympic Park.

Although it has been completed in time for the Olympics, it will also help cut commute times and stay in place after the games.

The two locations of the Emirates Airline has already been added to Transport for London maps.

North of the River Thames the Emirates Royal Dock is accessible via a short walk from Royal Victoria station on the DLR, while south of the river the Emirates Greenwich Peninsula is close to North Greenwich tube station on the Jubilee line.

Cabin crew from Emirates, which has contributed £36 million to the project, attend the launch

Cities already operating cable car systems include Barcelona, Cologne, Hong Kong, Lisbon, New York and Singapore.

By the time the facility opened to the public at noon, queues of customers had built up in the warm sunshine.

First in line to take a trip was 
Greenwich resident Matt Jarvis, who had been waiting for several hours. 
'It looks amazing,' said Mr Jarvis, a writer.

Former company director Maurice 
Bennett, 79, from Hampstead, north west London, said: 'I think it's 
brilliant and it's the shape of transport to come.'

Sean Murphy, from Tottenham, north 
London, had arrived at 6.55am believing he would get a ride at 7am, only
 to find he faced a five-hour wait.

'The wait has been worth it,' said Mr Murphy, who is retired.

By the time the first fare-paying 
passengers climbed aboard the cars, they were able to enjoy almost 
perfect conditions, with the showery rain of early morning long gone and
 replaced with clear, blue skies and soaring temperatures.
