Popular messaging app Snapchat today announced that it has partnered with 11 of America's top media brands, including DailyMail.com, in order to launch a new in-app news feature that will allow users to access a collection of the day's top stories and videos with just one swipe.

The app's new 'Discover' feature, which launches today, features 12 unique news channels, one for each media partner, plus a dedicated Snapchat channel which will include original content from the app's creators.

All of the media brands will handpick up to 15 different news stories and videos to feature on their own channels every day.

'Every day DailyMail.com will offer Snapchat users 10-15 of its best news stories,' Publisher and Editor in Chief Martin Clarke said of the company's channel.

‘Stories are either full length articles or the best video stories of the day. It will encompass a collection of breaking news, showbiz, lifestyle and all of the stories that DailyMail.com is famous for.’

Jon Steinberg, CEO of Daily Mail North America, added: ‘DailyMail.com on Snapchat is news and entertainment in our style and substance but also custom to this new media channel. 

'I think the notion of channels and "snaps" as news makes Discover something truly different from what anyone's seen on a social platform to date.’

Evan Spiegel, CEO and co-founder of Snapchat said: ‘We are huge fans of the DailyMail.com and we are grateful for the opportunity to partner with their outstanding team.’ 

Other media partners who will have their own channel on the app include ESPN, Comedy Central, the Food Network, CNN, Cosmopolitan, Yahoo! News, People, National Geographic, Vice and Warner Music Group.

Each media outlet will have complete editorial control over its channel, offering users a hand-curated and easy-to-digest collection of the stories which it feels are the most important.

All of the stories included in the Discover section of the app will be headlined with a 'top Snap' ten-second teaser which users can access simply by holding their finger down on the headline of the story that they wish to view. 

After the ten second teaser has come to an end, they can choose whether to scroll up and continue reading the story, or move on to something new. 

When all of the stories on a channel have been read, the color of its logo will change. The original color will return when the channel has been updated with a new edition the following day.

The new Discover service will be available to all users of the app, simply by downloading an update. 

Users will be able to access the new feature alongside the app's 'Stories' page, which shows when your friends have updated their profile and added any new public content. 

Since its launch in 2011, Snapchat, which now boasts more than 100 million worldwide users, has become one of the world's most popular social media platforms and is estimated to be worth close to $10 billion. 

The app was originally launched as a messaging service for those wishing to share slightly risque content, allowing users to send pictures - and, later on, videos - which would vanish from the recipient's phone within a matter of seconds.
