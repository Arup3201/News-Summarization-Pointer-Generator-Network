A convicted burglar who grew up being raped and beaten by her father and had three children by him is asking a judge to give her a lighter sentence on account of her horrific childhood.

Tatiana Thibes' father, Lindolfo Thibes, first raped her when she was a child and as she grew older the sexual assault was accompanied by beatings and torture. He took her out of school in the sixth grade and set up surveillance cameras around their Los Angeles-area house to keep her prisoner.

When he was arrested years later for stabbing her in the chest, the disturbing details of her ordeal finally came to light and he was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 for the pain he inflicted on her.

Four years later, the 33-year-old is waiting to hear whether she too will go to prison for her part in a string of burglaries in Tujanga or whether a judge will allow her to see out her sentence in a rehabilitation center.

Thibes appeared to be handling her life well, living with a boyfriend with whom she had her fourth baby and caring for her children, ensuring they got to school and did their homework.

But after she was forced to talk about her abuse around the time of her father's 2009 trial, things seemed to unravel.

She quit the therapy she was undergoing because discussing what happened made her feel worse.

'Not talking about it was the only way to protect my sanity,' she told the Los Angeles Times. 'I didn't want to face my worst fears, and that was getting counseling and confronting my abuse.'

A year and a half after her father's arrest she crashed while drunk driving on a freeway, and two of her passengers suffered minor injuries. She was put on probation. During the trial, she split with her boyfriend and started dating Adam Ortiz, a gang member with multiple run ins with the law.

He was sent to prison on gun charges and three months after he got out, in June, 2010, he began burlarizing houses - with Thibes' help.

Her job was to knock on doors to determine if anyone was home.

If no one answered, she returned to her car and Ortiz, 25, and two other gang members broke in and robbed the house.

A neighbor tipped off police, and the three were chased down then arrested.

The men were convicted of the crime last year, each being sentenced to at least 12 years' jail. She was also found guilty but claims she took part because she was frightened of Ortiz, the father of her youngest child.

She was jailed and her five children - aged from 2-16 - were taken from her. Thibes' attorney, Ron Seabold, is arguing that she should be sent to serve her sentence at a rehabilitation center where mothers can live with their children.

'We want to give her a chance, but she's in her early 30s....' Deputy District Attorney Richard Gallegly said. 'When will she stand up and take responsibility?'

One problem, however, is a state law that says someone who commits a serious crime, such as burglary, while on probation for another felony must be sentenced to prison.

Thibes had one more week on felony probation for her 2006 drunk driving offense when she was arrested for the burglaries, according to court records.

She currently works in the booking area of the women's jail in Lynwood. It's not clear when she'll be sentenced.

She said she wants to get her high school diploma and one day write a book, perhaps also become a therapist to help other women who have suffered similar trauma.

As for her dad, she said: 'I want him to die miserably in jail.' Referring to Arial Castro's recent suicide, she added: 'I don't want him to die and end his life that quick.'
