The niece of a man allegedly suffocated when his stepson gave him an 'atomic wedgie' has spoken out to quash the claims, saying instead he died of blunt force trauma that preceded the underwear yank and that the suspect spread the nasty rumor to embarrass his victim.

After news of the curious killing made headlines across the country, Jessica Kay St. Clair Hackney took to Facebook to insists Brad Davis bludgeoned Denver St. Clair in the head and then administered the 'atomic wedgie' when he was unconscious.

'I'm sure if he were conscious enough to undo the so-called wedgie, he would have been able to get it undone, but he was struck in the head with a weapon no one can find,' she wrote.

'...My uncle was killed by blunt force trauma. He may have been suffocated after being struck, but I'm almost sure that's not the case.'

Arrested: Brad Davis, right, has been accused of suffocating his stepfather by giving him an 'atomic wedgie' on December 21 but the victim's niece Jessica Kay St. Clair Hackney, left, says this isn't true

An autopsy found he was killed by blunt force trauma and/or asphyxiation.

Davis told authorities that he had given the 58-year-old man an 'atomic wedgie,' but Hackney wrote the 33-year-old was simply 'being a smart A$$.'

She added that it was a calculated plan to hurt the dead man's reputation.

'It's like he hurt the family again by trying to disgrace my uncle,' Hackney wrote.

She said she hoped that despite the fact the bizarre story has 'made headline news all over the U.S., hopefully everyone will figure out they arenâ€™t being given the whole story.'

The family are also angry because authorities never told them about the wedgie attack until after it was all over the news.

The 'sad thing is the family wasn't even warned about that part!' she wrote. 'We only knew he was beat.'

Victim: Denver Lee St. Clair, 58, was found dead in his Oklahoma home on December 21 with his underpants pulled over his head

Davis, a former Marine, is currently in custody for the alleged murder.

Police found Denver St. 
Clair dead in his McLoud, Oklahoma home with the waistband of his 
underpants pulled over his head on December 21.

Davis
 allegedly told police he pulled out the schoolyard bullying move after 
his stepfather 'jumped him' during a night of drinking.

'I'd
 never seen this before, but when we first looked at our victim seeing 
the waistband of his underwear was around his neck,' Pottawatomie County
 Sheriff Mike Booth told NewsOK.

Fight: Davis allegedly told police he pulled out the schoolyard bullying move after his stepfather, pictured, 'jumped him' during a night of drinking

Davis told detectives the altercation began when St. Clair badmouthed his ex-wife Tressia St. Clair - Davis' mother. 

The men began to fight before St. Clair allegedly tried to punch Davis.

Father and son brawled before Davis allegedly pulled the elastic band of his victim's underwear over his head from behind.

Davis said he acted in 'self-defense'. However the man's death has been ruled a homicide.

Police believe Davis altered the crime scene to make it look like the men had had a fight before he called 911.

'We
 continued our investigation and uncovered evidence that led us to 
believe that this was more than just a fight,' Sheriff Mike Booth said.

Breitbart TV reported Mr St. Clair was under a permanent 
protective order filed in 2008 by his wife Tressia St. Clair.

The woman claimed she found her husband embracing, in a 'sexual way', a drinking buddy and that he later grabbed her by the neck and threw her through a bathroom door, NewsOK reports.

Pottawatomie County court records show his wife filed for a 
divorce against him in 2010 but the divorce was dismissed. Denver St. 
Clair then filed for a divorce against her last year.

A Facebook page was set up after St. Clair's death last year to remember the motorcyle-lover. His funeral was held on December 28.

'He was one of a kind a man, he will be missed dearly,' his daughter Carol St. Clair wrote.

'Uncle Denver would be proud of all motorcycles riding in his honor. Thank you to each and everyone who rode in his honor and helped with memorial service,' his niece Tonya Renee Lester Dawson wrote.
