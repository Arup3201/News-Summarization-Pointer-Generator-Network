A U.S. soldier today won a major victory in a bitter transatlantic tug-of-love battle with his Scottish ex-wife over custody of their six-year-old daughter.

Sergeant Jeffrey Chafin claims Eris Hales Chafin should be living with him in Alabama and not with her mother Lynne Hales 4,000 miles away in Lanarkshire.

Today, America’s highest court, the U.S. Supreme Court, sided with Mr Chafin in unanimously dismissing a lower court’s ruling that the child should be allowed to stay in Scotland with her mother.

Following the 9-0 decision, Chief 
Justice John Roberts wrote for the court: ‘This dispute is very much 
alive,’ adding that the Chafins ‘continue to vigorously contest the 
question of where their daughter will be raised’.

However, the senior U.S. judge noted 
that separate custody hearings are already under way in Scotland and 
warned that a Scottish court may simply ignore the U.S. Supreme Court 
judgment.

The increasingly acrimonious fight is 
believed to be the first case involving a Scottish individual’s rights 
to have reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which only rules on family 
matters when they are of national significance.

Sgt Chafin, a bomb disposal expert, has questioned his ex-wife’s parenting.

Miss Hales, however, says that Eris is
better off with her and that Sgt Chafin has ‘left her with nothing’ 
because of her huge legal bills.

Firing back: Miss Hales says that Eris is better off with her

An earlier hearing in a lower court in
Alabama had awarded Miss Hales custody of Eris after agreeing that, 
under a 1980 Hague Convention signed by the U.S. and Britain, 
Lanarkshire had been Eris’s ‘habitual residence’ for most of her life, 
so she should go back there.

A subsequent appeal by Sgt Chafin was 
thrown out after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal ruled the issue was 
moot because the girl by then was already in Scotland and beyond its 
control.

However, when Sgt Chafin took his case
to the Supreme Court it ruled unanimously that the appeals court was 
wrong not to have considered the merits of his claim.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg noted the legal confusion arose because the U.S. Congress
did not indicate how custody appeals should be handled under the Hague 
Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Adoption.

The near two-year delay in Eris’s case ‘is hardly consistent with the convention’s objectives,’ Justice Ginsburg wrote.

Lawyers for both parties were unavailable for comment following the decision.

Previously, Sgt Chafin said his daughter was being shielded from the row so as not to upset her.

He said: ‘It’s not for her to know at 
this age. When she’s older she will know, but right now I would just 
rather she play with her dolls instead of being concerned about big 
court battles.’

Miss Hales, 35, met Sgt Chafin, 42, on
an online dating site while he was stationed in Germany in 2006 and 
they were married the following year at Culcreuch Castle Hotel near 
Fintry, Stirlingshire.

They moved temporarily to Alabama, but
she returned to live in Scotland for a large part of the time while he 
was on tours of duty in Afghanistan.

Things began to sour between them two
years ago and, while in the U.S., she was arrested on Christmas Eve, 
2010, for allegedly threatening him with a knife, though she denies 
this.

That month, Miss Hales was also arrested for alleged public drunkenness for apparently getting into a fight with a taxi driver.

No charges were brought, but while she
was in custody police realised she was in the U.S. on a 90-day tourist 
visa and she was deported.

Miss Hales, an administrator, won 
‘humanitarian parole’ from the immigration service and was allowed back 
in to attend a hearing in an Alabama court in which she was awarded 
custody of Eris.

Sgt Chafin has claimed he was only 
given 20 minutes to say goodbye to Eris in the court’s car park before 
Miss Hales took her back to Scotland.

He said: ‘It was horrible. She didn’t know what was going on. She was looking to me for answers and I couldn’t give them to her.

‘Eris is my everything. That’s why I’m fighting so hard to get her back into a safe place.’

Miss Hales said she had been ‘praying’ for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in her favour.
