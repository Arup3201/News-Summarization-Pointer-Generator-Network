A man arrested by counter terrorism officers was last night charged with trying to obtain the deadly poison ricin.

Mohammed Ammer Ali, 31, who was held following a series of raids in and around Liverpool last week, will appear in court this morning accused of attempting to obtain a chemical weapon.

The chemical in question was ricin, a poison 6,000 times more deadly than cyanide which has recently been used by extremists in the U.S. enclosed in letters sent to politicians including Barack Obama.

However police have stressed that officers have currently uncovered no plan or threat of an imminent attack either in Britain or abroad.

Ali, of Prescot Road, Liverpool, was arrested during raids on five properties last week following an investigation by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and Merseyside Police during which a number of items were seized.

He was initially held on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

However he was last night charged with attempting to have a chemical weapon in his possession between January 10 and February 12, contrary to the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and the Chemical Weapons Act 1996.

He is due to attend Westminster magistrates’ court today.

One of the properties raided last Wednesday was the Salt and Pepper restaurant on Prescot Road, Liverpool.

A witness described seeing 15 police officers, wearing gas masks and white boots, enter a property before seeing a woman and two children taken out and put into a van, with a man was placed in a separate van.

Witnesses described police cutting through the glass of the front door with an electric saw or angle grinder.

Dahir Hassan, who owns a nearby newsagent’s, described the scenes as ‘chaotic’.

‘Our shop opens at 6am and we heard a huge noise at around 7.30am,’ he said.

‘The police were shouting and they smashed down the shutters. The front door was completely ruined and the shutters were in pieces. It was very dramatic.’

Other properties raided included a large Victorian villa-style house in Rainhill, St. Helens understood to be a former nursery currently occupied by a software firm.

Neighbours said a number of police cars arrived early in the morning and began conducting searches.

In 2003 a British policeman was murdered in a raid on an Al Qaeda terrorist accused of running a terror plot allegedly involving the ricin.

Last year an actress who sent ricin-laced letters to President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was jailed for 18 years 

Special Branch officer Stephen Oake, 40, was stabbed by Kamel Bourgass during a police raid on a flat in Crumpsall, Manchester, with four other officers also injured.

Algerian Bourgass is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives as well as a life sentence for murder.

Last year an actress who sent ricin-laced letters to President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was jailed for 18 years.

Shannon Richardson, 36, from Texas, who has played small roles in The Vampire Diaries and The Walking Dead, according to IMDB, obtained ingredients online before posting the letters – all of which were intercepted – and blaming her estranged husband.

Experts say traces of ricin have been found caves used by militants in Afghanistan.

It is produced from the beans of the castor oil plant, and just 70 micrograms or two millionths of an ounce, roughly equivalent to the weight of a single grain of salt, can be enough to kill an adult.
