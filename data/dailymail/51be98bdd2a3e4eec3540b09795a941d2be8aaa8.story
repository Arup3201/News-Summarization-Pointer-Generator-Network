Southampton left-back Luke Shaw will complete a £31.5million transfer to Manchester United in the next 24 hours after being told he will be first-choice left-back.

It is understood that he has been 
assured that he will start and 
33-year-old Patrice Evra, who will remain with United, is expected to 
have a reduced role at Old Trafford.

Sportsmail revealed last night that the England international met United officials at the club's training ground, where he was given a personal tour ahead of a medical on Friday morning.

It is part of the understanding If all goes as expected, Shaw could be presented as a Manchester United player on Friday afternoon.

He stayed overnight in a Manchester hotel
 and will pay a visit to Old Trafford today to be shown around the 
club's iconic stadium and for promotional photographs.

He will then head
 away on holiday before returning to meet his new team-mates for 
pre-season.

Sportsmail understands that his holidays plans have been 
scheduled to ensure that he is back in time for United’s pre-season of 
the United States in July.

Shaw is understood to have informed Southampton of his desire to leave the club at the end of May and a wage package in excess of £100,000 has been agreed in principle between United and the player for some time.

Green light: Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead to bring in Luke Shaw

Former Old Trafford boss David Moyes did some of the groundwork in persuading Shaw to make the move, as United overcame interest from Chelsea to secure their man with a salary that blew the London club out of the water.

It is understood that Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead. The Dutchman has been in regular contact with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and he is understood to be delighted with the progress the club have made in the transfer market.

United cooled their interest in recent weeks to ensure that Shaw was fully focused on his involvement at the World Cup but as Sportsmail revealed on Monday morning, Ed Woodward intended to accelerate the pursuit once England returned from Brazil on Wednesday afternoon.

Shaw disembarked at Luton airport to see his family before heading up to the North-West to become Louis van Gaal's second Manchester United signing, after Ander Herrera completed his transfer to the club on Thursday afternoon.

Sportsmail also understands that assistant
 manager Ryan Giggs has returned from St. Georges Park to welcome Shaw, 
where he was undergoing his practical assessment for the Pro License 
coaching course on Thursday afternoon.

In the absence of Van Gaal and Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton greeted Herrera at Carrington.

The fee for Shaw is somewhat higher than United may have initially hoped for, with Southampton's resistance increasing following Shaw's involvement in the World Cup and the arrival of Dutch manager Ronald Koeman, who has sanctioned the sale.

United were initially confident of securing a £27.5 million swoop but Southampton have managed to push the overall fee beyond the £30 million mark.

Shaw becomes the most expensive teenager in world football and he is the second most expensive signing in Manchester United's history, behind January recruit Juan Mata, who arrived for a £37 million fee from Chelsea.

Shaw and Herrera are yet to be allocated squad numbers by Manchester United and it is believed that the club are waiting to offload a few players before allowing the two new signings to choose.
