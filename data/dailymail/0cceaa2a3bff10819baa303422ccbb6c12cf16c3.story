The Kansas City Chiefs (1-2) will be looking to build on last Sunday’s victory in Miami as they welcome the New England Patriots (2-1) to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday.

The Patriots find themselves with a winning record after the first three weeks of the season despite a couple of subpar performances.

Despite a miserable performance against the Tennessee titans on the opening weekend, the Chiefs have responded in their last two games. They almost beat the formidable Broncos in week two in Denver and eased past the Dolphins last Sunday with a 34-15 victory. Quarterback Alex Smith’s statistics have been deceiving during the last two games. Smith has moved the chains with relative ease despite the obvious frailties along the Chiefs offensive line.

Tom Brady will be hoping to find his top form soon after struggling for the New England Patriots

Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce gets away from Robert Lester during the game against Carolina Panthers

Standout running back Jamaal Charles remains questionable for the game. Knile Davis has filled in admirably in Charles’s absence, rushing for 211 yards and three touchdowns from 52 carries.

Wideouts Dwayne Bowe and Donny Avery have both struggled to establish themselves against opposing defenses. Outside of Bowe and Avery, second year tight end Travis Kelce has caught the eye and will become a household name by the time the season is over. Expect the Chiefs to implement a game plan for Kelce, with short intermediate routes in an attempt to shy away from challenging cornerback Darrelle Revis.

The Patriots have struggled on offense throughout the first three weeks of the season. Quarterback Tom Brady was guilty of a number of overthrows on deep routes in the opener against Miami as his offensive line crumbled around him. The three-time Super Bowl winner has improved in the last two weeks, but looks far from his usual potent self.

Julian Edelman has continued where he left off in 2013 having already reeled in 22 of his 27 targets for a total of 260 yards and one touchdown. Tight end Rob Gronkowski has yet to peak following his comeback from injury. Despite a limited role, Gronk continues to be a mismatch for defenses with two touchdowns and 116 yards receiving.

Stevan Ridley runs past Minnesota Vikings' free safety Harrison Smith earlier this month

The Patriots continue to run the ball by committee via Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen. The duo have amassed 272 yards and two touchdowns so far this season.

But the Patriots defense is not to be under estimated either as it finds itself ranked first overall against the pass and 10th overall against the run. The Chiefs, meanwhile, are ranked 22nd against the run and 10th against the pass.
