A man who allegedly raped a teenage girl after picking her up in his car and refusing to let her out despite her pleas for him to 'stop being a creep' was out on bail for drugs charges.

Police say the 15-year-old girl was walking along Darlinghurst Road in Sydney's Potts Point with a male friend on the night of December 8 when Saad Ahmed Khan, 39, drove up to the pair and offered them a lift about 11pm.

The pair, who had earlier been at the Wayside Chapel, accepted the lift.

When the girl's friend, who knew Khan, got out of the car to buy a Coke at a nearby convenience store, police allege he drove off with the 15-year-old girl trapped in the back seat.

He drove the girl around Sydney for around an hour, and allegedly repeatedly asked the 15-year-old if she wanted to 'hook up' or 'have sex', the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

When she said: 'Stop being a creep and take me back to the 7/11 now,' court documents state that Khan replied: 'You make me feel like a piece of s*** and you make me feel like a scumbag.'

Police facts allege the girl became too scared to talk and started shaking.

Khan then allegedly pulled into a dark street, stripped naked and forced her to perform oral sex on him.

The Marsfield man then allegedly pulled off her skirt and underwear and forced her to lie down in his car, then forced her to have sexual intercourse.

Eventually, police say, Khan drove the girl back to Kings Cross and dropped her off.

'Thank you, that's all I wanted,' he allegedly said while driving her back to Potts Point.

When he was pulled over by police for driving an unregistered car, police took the 15-year-old to the police station in relation to another matter.

Police said the teenager started crying and said she was sexually assaulted.

She went back to her home on the NSW Central Coast and was interviewed by police two days later. 

He did not appear at Burwood Local Court or apply for bail when his matter was mentioned on Thursday

Khan voluntarily attended Ryde Police Station on Wednesday where he was charged with detaining a person with intent to obtain advantage and two counts of aggravated sexual assault.

He did not appear at Burwood Local Court or apply for bail when his matter was mentioned on Thursday.

He is due to attend Central Local Court later this month.

At the time of the alleged offence Khan was out on bail for charges relating to the possession and supply of prohibited drugs.

He was arrested on September 15 last year, and granted police bail which was continued by the court.

Under his bail conditions he was not allowed to go within 1km of Kings Cross Railway Station or commit further offences whilst on bail.
