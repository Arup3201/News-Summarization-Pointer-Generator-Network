His chances of surviving another another elimination after last week's emotional meltdown were initially slim - but Astro may have learned how to beat the system.

Upon learning that there would be not one but two eliminations this week, the 15-year-old rapper kicked off his high-powered performance with an apology on tonight's X Factor.

The pint-sized prodigy threw a wobbly when he landed in the bottom two alongside fan favourite Stacy Francis last week - and hasn't been shy about complaining the competition is 'rigged'.

Redemption song: Astro apologises twice for the temper tantrum he threw on last week's show

Will he survive? The 15-year-old rapper performed his own song tonight on X-Factor

But to survive his massive temper tantrum, Astro nee Brian Bradley, knew he'd have to eat some humble pie tonight.

Given
that each contestant was meant to dedicate tonight's song to someone 
who has influenced or made a difference in their lives, Astro's move was
completely strategic.

He thanked the supporters who stuck with him in the aftermath of last week's drama before shouting an apology from the darkness.

Taking
to the stage, Astro opened his performance, rapping: 'No tantrums this 
week. I'm 15... 15 is the new 25. What you want me to do? I'm sorry, I'm
from Brooklyn.'

Back on track: Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell praise Astro for apologising and getting his focus back

Proud: Nicole and Astro's mentor LA Reid were equally positive in their commentary, with Reid telling the teen he had humbled himself this week

He then launched into a furious rap of Tonight's The Night, an original song in the style of Jay-Z's 30 Something.

He apologised again for real after his high-energy performance, earning kudos from the judges for doing the right thing.

'Last week I had a moment. It got over my head a little bit. I could have handled myself better,' he said, adding to his fans: 'I will never let you down again.'

Nicole Scherzinger, 33, told him he was a champion and advised him to always remain grateful.

Paula Abdul, 49, has previously spoken out about his bad behaviour, calling his rant a 'character mistake'. Tonight she graciously stated that he is well on his way to being 'prolific'.

Last group standing: Lakoda Rayne sang sweetly to Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me

His own mentor, 55-year-old L.A. Reid, complimented him for doing the right thing, the necessary thing, to last another week.

Shockingly, he even had some unexpected support in notoriously cantankerous judge Simon Cowell, 52.

Simon told the young rapper that, not only did he admire his gumption, but that the music industry needs someone to shake it up and some 'unpredictability'.

So how did the others fare? Paula Abdul's final group, Lakoda Rayne, did surprisingly well given that they typically wind up in the bottom two.

Mini superstar: 13-year-old Rachel Crow dedicated Yolanda Adams' I Believe to her foster parents

The ladies - Paige Elizabeth, 18, 
Hayley Orrantia, 17, Cari Fletcher, 17, and Dani Knights, 22 - honoured 
two dads, a boyfriend and a grandmother, respectively.

They performed Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me to high praise from all judges.

Paula, of course, couldn't resist gushing how proud she was of their collective achievements.

Perhaps Cowell was in a cheerful mood, or has gotten into the Thanksgiving spirit, because he, too, touted the group.

Simon said it was their best performance to date and he genuinely hopes that Lakoda Rayne doesn't go home tomorrow night.

Young Rachel Crow dedicated her performance of Yolanda Adams' I Believe to the foster family who adopted her at a young age and saved her from living in a crack house.

A song for his mama: Marcus Canty sings Boyz II Men's A Song For Mama right to his own mother

A touching moment: Marcus and his mother hug it out after his performance

All four judges agreed that the 
13-year-old spitfire's performance was fabulous, but she drew raves in 
particular from both Paula and Nicole.

The
former Pussycat Doll said that Crow made 'a believer' out of everyone 
in America, calling her an 'inspiration' and a 'bright light.'

Paula, of course, topped this, saying that the Shirley Temple-esque singer is 'a living angel on Earth.'

Maryland native Marcus Canty dedicated Boyz II Men's A Song For Mama to his mother, naturally.

He played the crowd by crouching down mid-performance to sing directly to his mother and hugging her at its end.

A joyful performance: Melanie Amaro breaks down after singing R. Kelly's The World's Greatest

Touched: Judge Nicole Scherzinger got emotional during Amaro's performance

Again, all the judges were in agreement that he was wonderful. His own mentor, Reid, gave him particularly high praise by saying he was as great a singer as he's ever worked with.

Melanie Amaro gave thanks like she was winning an Oscar, dedicating her performance of R. Kelly's The World's Greatest to God.

She breaks down in tears at the end of the song and thanks her mentor, Simon, for keeping her in the competition.

The new Eminem: Chris Rene rapped a version of The Beatles Let It Be

Although her sobs cause Nicole to cry, Paula offers some unusual criticism by saying the typically quiet and reserved 19-year-old's choice of a backing choir wasn't necessary.

Simon furiously tells Paula to shut up before urging the crowd to make sure Melanie isn't sent packing tomorrow night.

Chris Rene dedicates his quirky rap performance of The Beatles' Let It Be as well as one of his own tunes to his rehab counsellor, Tim Fry.

Angel: LeRoy Bell dedicated Sarah McLachlan's Angel to his mother, who passed away two years ago

The 28-year-old's only criticism was from Simon, who said that he didn't like the way Rene adapted The Beatles, but that he enjoyed the original song.

Like Marcus, 60-year-old LeRoy Bell thanked his mother, Janice, who passed away two years ago.

After singing Sarah McLachlan's Angel, he drew mostly raves from the judges, though L.A. Reid said it wasn't his very best performance.

BFF: Drew dedicated Demi Lovato's Skyscraper to her best friend, Shelby

How did I do: Seen here after the performance with host Steve Jones. Her performance sparked a war of words between Cowell and Reid

Paula thought it was his 'most beautiful' performance yet, while Simon respectfully agreed to disagree with Reid's critique and that Bell 'made his mark' this week.

Like a typical teenager, 14-year-old Drew Ryniewicz dedicated Demi Lovato's Skyscraper to her best friend, Shelby, because it's 'their song.'

While Nicole and Paula agreed that the song was lovely, L.A. was critical in saying that the song was too old for her.

Lullaby: Josh Krajcik sang Chantal Kreviazuk's Wild Horses for his daughter, Rowan

Emotional: Josh's daughter watched on from the audience. He dedicated his performance to her

He finally managed to draw Simon's ire, who turned on the music producer and said he was sick to death of his 'pointless, stupid criticism.'

Last but not least was a performance from Josh Krajcik, who dedicated Chantal Kreviazuk's rendition of The Rolling Stones' Wild Horses to his daughter, Rowan, while playing the piano.

The 30-year-old finally had his moment on the show, finally causing the judges to agree, play nicely and embody the spirit of Thanksgiving.

Feisty: As usual, the judges were candid with the contestants - and each other during the nine contestants' performances

As the entire crowd leaped to their feet in applause, Simon finally gave kudos to Nicole - a big moment given the two have been at odds since the season began.

Krajcik may have succeeded in bringing the two together, as, through her tears, Nicole even thanked Simon.

She told Josh that, through the competition, his music can change the world. While that remains to be seen, his song certainly did create a minor miracle.
