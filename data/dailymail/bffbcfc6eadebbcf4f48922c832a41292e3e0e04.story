Peter Francis lived a double life for years, infiltrating radical anti-racist groups on behalf of his Special Branch employers.

The officer, who claims one of his tasks was to ‘dig dirt’ on the key witness in the Stephen Lawrence case – Duwayne Brooks – says he immersed himself in his work, seducing female members of the groups he joined and even participating in violence.

The son of a German mother and a New Zealander father brought up in Norfolk, his parents divorced at the age of 12 and Mr Francis said his childhood left him with ‘a lot of suppressed rage’ and aggression, useful qualities for posing as a left-wing activist.

Peter Francis lived a double life as he spent years infiltrating radical anti-racists groups

Francis originally wanted to join MI5 but joined Special Branch after four years in uniform

Initially wanting to join MI5, he was told by a teacher he was not ‘posh’ enough – an Oxbridge background was deemed essential. But the career adviser said he might have more success joining Special Branch.

To this end, he enrolled with the Met and graduated top of his class from Hendon police college in 1986.

Following four years in uniform, he joined Special Branch. His undercover unit was known by colleagues as the ‘hairies’ because they grew long hair and beards to resemble the agitators they targeted.

They adopted false identities – acquired by stealing the identities of real people who would have been about the same age but died as children – and were given a flat, vehicles and ‘cover’ jobs to help them blend in.

At short notice, Mr Francis was told he would have to pose as a Trotskyite and infiltrate one of the anti-racist groups which had grown in popularity following Stephen Lawrence’s murder.

Strangely for someone who was supposed to be keeping a low profile, he was given a big leaving party before his deployment – knowing he would not see his police friends for at least five years.

Mr Francis claims his superiors 
ordered him to monitor Stephen’s family and even smear the campaign. He 
told the Guardian their aim was to calm the growing movement around 
Lawrence’s death and ‘stop it in its tracks’.

One of his first objectives was to gain the trust of a key anti-fascist leader at London’s Kingsway College.

Posing as a dyslexic mature student – he enrolled at the college and quickly made himself known by punching a man who made a racist remark to a dinner lady in the canteen.

The leaders of the group were impressed by his zeal and enlisted him to join marches against the BNP.

He set out to prove himself to the group, even attacking the police during a weekend demonstration so nobody would suspect he was working as an undercover officer.

They were so convinced that they allowed him to take an active part in the violent demonstration against a BNP bookshop in Welling, south-east London just weeks after Stephen Lawrence’s murder.

Mr Francis was on one of the 550 coaches of demonstrators who travelled to the march, and said he turned up prepared to participate in ‘the biggest ruck since the poll tax riots’.

Officers decided to pounce when Stephen’s friend Duwayne Brooks, who witnessed the teenager’s fatal stabbing, said he had attended the Welling demonstration. Police started to trawl through footage of the disorder and charged Brooks with criminal damage five months later.

The intelligence was their first major breakthrough as they tried to undermine the Stephen Lawrence case because it showed Duwayne was a ‘violent activist’, Mr Francis told Channel 4’s Dispatches.

A judge later threw out the case over an abuse of legal process.

The trust he managed to gain in Welling allowed him to become the Hackney and Islington branch secretary of Youth Against Racism in Europe – a leading left-wing organisation that acted as a front for some of its more militant members.

Francis retired in 2001 and later received an out-of-court settlement from the Met

His rise was partly due to his willingness to take on time-consuming, boring administrative roles.

But his involvement was so extensive that he had to be careful he did not end up running the group he was sent to bring down.

Mr Francis lived in his cover flat six days a week and rarely saw his wife and two young sons. He immersed himself completely within the group – even sleeping with two members.

‘You can’t be in that world full time for five years and never have a girlfriend or boyfriend,’ he added. ‘People would start to ask questions.’

While sex with activists was considered acceptable, there was an unofficial rule that you must ‘never fall in love’ while undercover.

He eventually returned to normal duties in 1997 and was awarded a special commendation for his outstanding performance in a ‘prolonged sensitive operation’. Mr Francis was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

He retired in 2001 and later brought legal action against the Met, receiving an out-of-court settlement.
