If you've ever worried about breaking your mobile by dropping it - worry no more.

Finnish retailer Verkkokauppa.com decided to take the flagship phone made by compatriot company Nokia and put it through the ultimate drop test: by taking it up to the edge of space and then letting it fall.

The team took the Nokia Lumia 920 - the Finnish phonemaker's flagship handset - up to the roof of its store in Jätkäsaari, in the Finnish capital of Helsinki, attached it to a weather balloon, and let it go.

Using the phone's own camera, the ascent - to 30kms, or nearly 100,00ft - above the earth's surface - was recorded for posterity.

Amazingly, the phone - which was held in a special container - survived nearly half an hour in the sub-zero temperatures of the edge of space and its return to earth.

In a twist, the Finnish retailer later revealed that a second phone had been dropped - and that there's a reward of 1,000euros (£810) for the finder.

But you'll need to wrap up warm - and perhaps take diving gear - as the phone was last reported in the Finnish lakes region of South Karelia. Its GPS co-ordinates suggest that it might be under water.

This isn't the first time items have been sent up into the stratosphere.

Back in February, games company EA launched copies of its blockbuster game Mass Effect 3: Space Edition into the stratosphere.

The launch of two balloons containing copies of the game as well as branded hoodies and water bottles took place near the pretty town of Saffron Walden in Essex.

The balloons and their payloads returned to earth shortly afterwards.

The recovery team from EA faced hostile alien conditions when it tried to collect the goodies.

'Ground crew being attacked by cows', the team tweeted.

But the good news was: 'Cows did not eat copies'.

However, the most spectacular space drop this year was of course that of daredevil Felix Baumgartner, who had the whole world holding its breath in October when he jumped to earth from a breathtaking height of 39km.

The Austrian daredevil went up to the edge of space in a balloon, and then, as casually as if he were stepping off a platform, jumped.

His fall back to earth took just 
four minutes and 19 seconds.In the process, he set the record for the 
highest manned balloon flight.

Action
man Baumgartner also set the record for the fastest speed of free fall 
at 1,342 kilometres per hour (834 mph) and became the first human to 
break the sound barrier outside of a vehicle.
