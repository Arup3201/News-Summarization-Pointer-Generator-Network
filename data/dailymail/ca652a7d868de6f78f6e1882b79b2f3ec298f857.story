A male S&M prostitute called the German Master is set to give evidence in the honeymoon murder case against Shrien Dewani, it emerged today.

Munich-born Leopold Leisser will be called to support the prosecution case that millionaire Mr   Dewani is secretly gay and wanted to get out of his marriage to Anni.

Leisser, who is based in Birmingham,  reportedly told police that he met Dewani for sex sessions after the relationship with his bride-to-be had begun.

The 40-year-old, who describes himself as 'Europe's leading S&M (sadomasochism) Escort', claimed Dewani told him that he was engaged.

Today, Dewani appeared in a South African 
court where a judge ordered that he will remain at Valkenberg 
Hospital in Cape Town to receive further treatment for his mental 
health.

Dressed in a dark suit and tie, he was brought up into the dock in front of his parents and other relatives.

Dewani's
 lawyer, Francois van Zyl said: 'I am informed that he has been fully 
co-operative and that his condition has improved. We have been told by 
treating psychiatrists not to consult with him for longer than 30 
minutes at a time.'

Judge President John Hlophe postponed the matter until June 20. Dewani will remain in custody until then, at a secure mental facility.

Dewani fought a long legal battle against extradition to South Africa to face a conspiracy to murder charge. He lost and was extradited last month, flying to South Africa by private jet for his first court appearance in  the country.

Claims: Prosecutors claim Dewani hired a hitman to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied

Dewani, a care home owner, has always denied ordering the killing of Anni. He has always denied being gay and says he can prove he was elsewhere on the dates Leisser said they met.

Anni's father Vinod Hindocha, 64, has previously spoken of misgivings about the relationship even before the couple had their lavish £200,000 wedding in a Mumbai hotel.

Anni's father told police that she wanted to end the engagement and walked out on her husband-to-be.

Mr Hindocha said that Anni became convinced that Dewani would change and told her father: 'Papa, he's like a Hitler - but don't worry - I will get married.'

It also emerged that over a period of four months before the murder, 28-year-old Anni sent a sequence of messages to her cousin Sneha in Britain and they show the young bride had deep-seated reservations about Dewani.

In one despairing message five weeks before the wedding, Anni told Sneha: 'I don't want to marry him... I'm going to be unhappy for the rest of my life... one cannot even hug him... we have nothing  in common.'

Shrien Dewani, from Bristol, had fought his removal from the UK to face proceedings over wife Anni's death

In another text, Anni wrote: 'Want to cry myself to death.' Yet another read: 'Crying every day.' A month before the wedding she texted: 'Hate him.'

And three days before her death, she messaged Sneha: 'I don't feel happy at all.' Sneha has told police that Anni called off the engagement and marriage at least three times, only for Shrien to change her mind each time.

When the texts are taken alongside statements from other witnesses, the police files depict a marriage that was doomed before it began.

Xolile Mngeni, who prosecutors claim was the hitman, was convicted of premeditated murder over the shooting, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence.
