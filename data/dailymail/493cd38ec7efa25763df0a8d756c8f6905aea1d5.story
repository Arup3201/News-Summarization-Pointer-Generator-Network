Pippa Middleton stepped out in South Kensington yesterday looked every inch the elegant It Girl.

Kate's younger sister was seen leaving offices in the upmarket London borough, dressed in an elegant mint green dress by Logue London and carrying two large statement handbags.

The 29-year-old has recently been on holiday with her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson. She has denied that he has proposed after rumours circulated this week of a secret engagement.

Chic: Pippa carried two high end designer bags and wore Jemima Vine pumps on her feet

Pippa carried an £80 large tote from Paul's Boutique, while her slouchy grey bag was the £580 Romina from Aruna Seth.

She wore Givenchy sunglasses and a number of rings on both hands, including one on the little finger - the signet ring bearing her family crest - and the middle finger of her left hand.

On her right hand she wore an attractive gold ring set with multiple stones.

Pippa, who now has a column in both Waitrose magazine as well as a monthly feature in U.S. Vanity Fair, who list her as a contributing editor, has seen her career go from strength to strength of late.
