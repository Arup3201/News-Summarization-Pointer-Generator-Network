A British witch doctor who became one of the most prolific conwomen in history may have pocketed a staggering £5m during her 12-year scam, it emerged today.

Juliette D’Souza, 59, was jailed for 10 years at London’s Blackfriars Crown Court last Friday after she persuaded vulnerable 'patients' to hand over their 
life savings - insisting the money would be hung from a sacred tree in the
 Amazon as a sacrifice.

Initially she was believed to have made around £1million from the con, which she used to pay for first class flights, antique furniture and a £3,000 Hermes handbag.

But a senior police officer in charge of the investigation said the victims involved in the court case were 'just a fraction' of the elaborate scheme.

Detective Constable Fiona Graham, from 
the Metropolitan Police, said: 'That’s £1m from a handful of people, but
 she’s been doing it for decades. I can easily believe it’s more than 
£5m.'

D’Souza, of Hampstead, was jailed for 23 counts of fraud and deception spanning from 1998 to 2010.

The self-proclaimed healer told potential victims she had 
helped cure John Cleese’s daughter of cancer, boasted of knowing 
Princess Diana and claimed she could introduce a young 
singer to Simon Cowell.

Advertising her services
 in Tatler magazine, she charged just £35 for a consultation but then 
demanded huge sums to be used as the 'sacrifices' in Suriname, South America.

There she claimed two other shamans would perform 
rituals around the money before it was sent back with all the victims' problems resolved - but the money was never returned.

Police fear the bogus shaman healer may 
have used links to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead and a Camden 
Council care home to target dozens more vulnerable victims.

The hospital has confirmed that a staff member, who still works at the hospital, faced disciplinary action after directing a patient to D’Souza in July 2012.

It allegedly led to a seriously ill Hampstead man being told he would 'die on the operating table' by D’Souza if he did not hand over more than £10,000.

Ms Graham added: 'If a nurse at the Royal Free recommended D’Souza to one victim, knowing what I know, they must have genuinely believed in her.

'There could be a whole other group of victims.'

D’Souza has also been investigated for two other high value fraud schemes.

One involved allegedly cheating Filipino immigrants seeking UK visas which may have earned her another £1m.

She has also been connected to a police probe linked to the Branch Hill care home, where her parents lived.

Ms Graham, of the Met Police, admitted police were wrong to dismiss the case in 2007, when many of D’Souza’s victims first visited Holborn Police Station.

The senior officer, who along with Detective Constable Linda Kernot was highly praised by the trial judge, said: 'It was the wrong decision - and the judge confirmed it was the wrong decision.

'However, I can understand why that decision was made.'

Ms Graham said there was a lot of evidence of more victims, including one who allegedly gave D’Souza £600,000, but did not want to take part in the court case.

'I believe she’s been defrauding people for decades,' she said. 'I believe it’s a natural thing for her to do and that she won’t even be able to stop herself in prison.

'There are many more victims out there and we’re actively encouraging any further victims to come forward.'

Judge Ian Karsten, QC, branded D’Souza the worst confidence trickster he 'had ever heard of'.

He said she not only 'ruined' victims financially, she 'dominated' them and 'wrought havoc' on their lives.

As he 
jailed her, he said: 'It is the worst case of confidence fraud that I have ever 
had to deal with or indeed that I have ever heard of.

'The
 most serious aspect of this case is that you wrecked the lives of a 
number of your victims and you have done it out of pure greed.'

Following
 a five-week trial the jury took only an hour to convict the serial 
conwoman of all 23 charges of fraud and obtaining property by deception.

Judge
 Karsten said D’Souza had ripped off her victims by making strange 
claims of cash 'sacrifices' hanging from a sacred tree in the Amazon 
jungle in Suriname.

She 
funded a luxury lifestyle by extracting huge sums from desperate people,
 some with terminal illnesses or cancer-stricken relatives.

Her victims were so much under her 
spell during the 12-year scam that one woman, who cannot be named, had 
an abortion because D’Souza told her to.

And another, Ruth Fillingham, even sold her home after being told that it was 'spooked'.

Judge Karsten also condemned D’Souza for trying to pin the fraud on her osteopath friend Keith Bender.

And,
 by failing to plead guilty, she forced her terrified victims to give 
evidence to the court and 'relive the extremely unpleasant experiences' 
while lacking the courage to go into the witness box herself.

The
 judge said there were undoubtedly further victims, including one 'who 
is no longer alive' - a reference to the aborted child.

'You were able to exercise considerable influence, indeed a spell over these victims,' said Judge Karsten.

'They
 did exactly what you required them to do. They were terrified, in many 
cases, of the consequences of disobeying your instructions.

'They
 lost all their autonomy and they became entirely dependent on you. You 
saw to it that they were cut off from their own friends and family.

'You managed to dominate these individuals and make them bow to your will.'

D’Souza’s
 web was finally untangled in 2007 as she made a series of mistakes 
which aroused her victims’ suspicions.

She claimed to have attended St 
Hilliard’s College, Oxford, which does not exist and got the name of 
Princess Diana’s sister wrong.

Far from having a university education, she was a former 
cleaner, receptionist and temp.

The
 woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to 
Hampstead police station in north London, but said officers ‘laughed in 
my face’.

This left her 
so angry she forced her way into D’Souza’s home with the help of Mr 
Bender, who was paying the rent on that property, and three others.

Inside they found bags of shopping, an abandoned monkey and a voodoo treasure trove – which included 
drawings of an ‘evil eye’, burned photos and a brand new barrister’s 
wig.

D’Souza would give her 'customers' 
detailed instructions about how the money was to be paid - always in 
cash and in a brown envelope.

Part of her system was to demand a full-length photograph from each victim.

Pet: Mr Bender had been visiting one flat to feed D'Souza's pet monkey, Joey, but did not dare enter the remaining flats for fear they were cursed. The monkey was later adopted by the TV comic Stephen Fry

One
 victim - who was told to pay £18,000 or her partner would die - said: 
'I was absolutely terrified. I was living in fear and doing what I was 
told.'

Another was 82-year-old former opera singer Sylvia Eaves, who was duped out of more than £350,000 by D’Souza between 1998 and 2010.

The widow, whom the judge described as a 'delightful lady', handed over the money for various reasons including help with a stomach problem and to 'save' her ill sister.

'I’m relieved that she won’t be doing it to anybody else,' Mrs Eaves said at her sentencing. 'I feel terribly sad that somebody who is so clever would resort to that, especially as she was a friend of mine. I feel terribly let down that she could behave like that.

'She relieved me of a lot of money but I’m still here. I was gullible, I suppose, but my sister was very ill at the time.'

A mother of a ten-year-old boy with 
Down’s Syndrome who was also conned out of £42,000 when D’Souza claimed 
she could cure his behavioural problems.

Other victims included retired solicitor Richard Collier-Wright, who paid £7,000 to cure his terminal leukaemia, while former photographer Jocelyn Bain-Hogg, who handed D’Souza thousands to improve the health of his mother who was having heart surgery.

A couple, who cannot be named, gave tens of thousands to the fraudster after she claimed she could help with their child’s disability and behavioural problems.

Another victim, Geoffrey Wheeler, handed over around £160,000 to 'protect' him from being made redundant but was left in financial ruin.

Her barrister, Stephen Fidler, told the court D’Souza’s elderly mother had been unwell for a considerable time and she visits her every day.

But the judge told her: 'I find no mitigating factors in your case at all.'
