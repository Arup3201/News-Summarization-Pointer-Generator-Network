Dennis Wise's son Henry has signed a one-year deal to play for Arsenal. 

Henry Wise, aged 15, will train at Arsenal’s Hale End academy after leaving Queens Park Rangers to play for the north London club.

The midfielder joins all three Beckham sons, Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz, plus Frank Lampard’s nephew at the Arsenal training centre.

Despite Dennis Wise’s reputation as a no-nonsense midfielder, his son Henry plays in a more advanced, creative role in the middle of the pitch.

Wise captained Chelsea at the start of the glory years and his son aims to follow in his famous father’s footsteps as he begins his career with Arsene Wenger’s side. 

Henry Wise joined QPR as a youngster but was wanted by a number of other clubs in the Barclays Premier League after emerging as a genuine talent in the game.

Although Wise still has links with his former club Chelsea, the junior member of the family wanted to join Arsenal’s Hale End academy.

Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere is one of a number of players to progress through the youth-team ranks to become a regular first-team player.

Although Wise has only just officially completed his move to Arsenal, he is expected to be a regular member of the club’s youth team for the rest of the season.
