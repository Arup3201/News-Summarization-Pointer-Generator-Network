England manager Roy Hodgson has been forced to make a bizarre apology after making a joke about a monkey while referring to a mixed-race player during a half-time team talk.

The coach's gaffe is believed to have upset a player in the dressing room during England's 2-0 win over Poland at Wembley on Tuesday night which secured the team's place in the next World Cup.

Hodgson made the joke, which refers to the early days of Nasa space missions, as he was telling defender Chris Smalling that he should pass the ball to midfielder Andros Townsend - both players are mixed-race.

Several prominent footballers have come forward to defend the manager, but anti-racism campaigners have demanded that the FA launch an investigation to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

Good man: Hodgson is being tarnished by over-zealous reactions from activists

Star: The remark came as Hodgson urged players to pass to up-and-coming star Andros Townsend

He told players: 'Nasa decides to send a shuttle into space with two monkeys and an astronaut on board.

'After
months of training, they put all three in the shuttle and prepare for 
launch. Mission control announces: "This is mission control to Monkey 
One. Do your stuff." The first monkey begins frantically typing and the 
shuttle takes off.

'Two
hours later, mission control centre announces: "This is mission control
to Monkey Two. Do your stuff." The second monkey starts typing like mad
and the shuttle separates from its empty fuel tanks.

'After another two hours mission control announces: "This is mission control to astronaut..."

'The astronaut interrupts, shouting: 'I know, I know - feed the monkeys and don't touch anything!"'

The FA confirmed that Hodgson did
make the remarks, but said they were disappointed that it has been interpreted by 
some as a racial slur or innuendo.

Hodgson said last night: ‘I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time.

‘There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate.

‘I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday.

‘He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.’

The
coach is said to be furious, and 
insists the joke refers only to a fictional event and cannot be 
interpreted as having any racial connotations, despite the historic use 
of 'monkey' as a racist term for black people.

Nasa decides to send a shuttle into space with two monkeys and an astronaut on board.

After months of training, they put all three in the shuttle and prepare for launch. Mission control announces: 'This is mission control to Monkey One. Do your stuff.'

The first monkey begins frantically typing and the shuttle takes off.

Two hours later, mission control centre announces: 'This is mission control to Monkey Two. Do your stuff.'

The second monkey starts typing like mad and the shuttle separates from its empty fuel tanks.

After another two hours mission control announces: 'This is mission control to astronaut...'

The astronaut interrupts, shouting: 'I know, I know - feed the monkeys and don't touch anything!'

Townsend, a promising 22-year-old 
winger for Tottenham Hotspur, told the FA he was not offended by the 
joke when officials spoke to him about the incident.

He tweeted today: 'I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even newsworthy!'

His father Troy works for the anti-racism campaign Kick It Out, and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son. 

A spokesman for Kick It Out said that 
the organisation 'recognises and shares the concerns of the parties who 
felt mindful to bring the comments into the public domain.'

He
added: 'The matter has been raised by the Chair directly with the FA, 
who acknowledges the apology made by Roy Hodgson and now seeks an 
investigation to ascertain the full facts and ensure a similar situation
does not arise again.'

Controversy: The joke was made to Manchester United's right-back Chris Smalling

'All
the FA has to do is examine the facts and make a statement. If they do 
not then there will be recriminations from other players.'

Piara Powar, executive director of 
European anti-discrimination group FARE, said: 'Hodgson used a very 
silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better.'

Hodgson is understood to be distraught
by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading England to next year's World Cup finals in Brazil on Tuesday.

The 66-year-old manager is known for his lengthy team talks, but the decision to tell a joke at half-time is unusual.

Some football fans expressed outrage at the alleged racial jibe - Adekunle Dimeji tweeted: 'Roy Hodgson should be sacked.'

However,
others stood up for him and insisted he meant no harm by the remark, 
such as Bryn Jones who wrote: 'If you think Roy Hodgson's "feed the 
monkey" remark was racist, then you didn't get the joke.'

Former footballer Stan Collymore, who
played for Liverpool and Aston Villa as well as appearing three times 
for England, took to Twitter to defend the manager, claiming that the 
supposed scandal detracts from anti-racism efforts.

'Demeans
every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH who said NOTHING
WRONG,' he wrote. 'Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're 
not.'

Legendary striker 
John Barnes, who was often subjected to racial abuse during his playing 
career, said: ‘How can anybody be offended by that? It’s not racist.'

England's Wayne Rooney added: 'Seen the story on Roy this morning. He [sic] done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.'

Ridiculous: That Roy Hodgson is being smeared as a racist by politically correct thought police is ludicrous

The row has taken the gloss off 
England’s qualification, which was praised by David Cameron in Parliament yesterday, and came as it was revealed that Hodgson is in 
line for a huge bonus after leading England to Brazil.

If he is successful next summer, the 
cash reward he will receive could reach £1million.

Hodgson 
accepted a basic package worth £3million a year when he left West Bromwich Albion to take over the England team after the previous manager Fabio Capello resigned ahead of last year's Euro 2012 tournament.

He has previously spoken out against racism in football, saying that racial prejudice is 'abhorrent'.
