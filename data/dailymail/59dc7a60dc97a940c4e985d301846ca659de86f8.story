An Ohio state trooper is being heralded as a hero after he saved a driver from being crushed to smithereens by an oncoming truck.

Unbelievable dashcam footage of the near miss on February 20 was released by the Ohio State Highway Patrol on Friday.

Trooper Stephen Zientek pulled over to help stranded driver, Mike Celusta, with a broken battery, reported ABC.

'Look out!' shouted trooper Zientek as he and Celusta were miraculously able to jump a rail to safety as the truck slid on the sides of both cars.

The trooper's car hit Celusta's and sharp debris flew through the air.

Zientek feels blessed to be alive after he rolled down a hill from the guard rail and a car part landed inches from his head.

'Days after that, all I think about is that I still cannot believe there still was not more serious injuries…that everybody walked away' Zientek said.

'It was just Hollywood-type script and now that I can see it, it makes it even more surreal,' Celusta told WTVG.

'As soon as he says, "Look out!" I just went,' Celusta said.

'I couldn't see what was happening, so I just jumped over the rail,' he added.

The truck driver was cited, reports WVTG.
