Overstretched hospitals had to close their A&E departments to ambulances hundreds of times last year as the crisis in the NHS deepens.

Ambulances were turned away and sent to other hospitals no fewer than 357 times in 2012/13 - up almost a quarter on the previous year.

The alarming figures, uncovered by Labour, show that on average over the past year, one casualty department had to close its doors every single day.

Concerns: Extra delays can increase the risk that patients inside could deteriorate before medical help is received

Extra delays can increase the risk that patients inside could deteriorate before medical help is received.

The most recent example was on Bank Holiday Monday, when the Royal Liverpool Hospital had to divert patients to Fazakerley Hospital and Whiston Hospital for periods during both the morning and afternoon.

Even when it reopened, ambulances had to queue and patients faced long delays.

The figures come amid growing concerns over emergency and out-of-hours care.

Last week the Daily Mail revealed that 50 beds a week have closed in NHS hospitals since the election - piling extra pressure on A&E departments.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week blamed GPs for the overcrowding in England’s casualty wards - saying it was too hard to get an appointment to see them, meaning many have no choice but to turn up at A&E.

In addition, more than nine in 10 GPs opted out of responsibility for their patients out of hours in 2004 despite taking advantage of a huge pay rise as part of a botched contract.

Replacement out of hours services proved inadequate in many areas - meaning patients have to go to casualty.

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, demanded a moratorium on the closure of casualty units across the country in light of the latest alarming figures.

‘A&Es across the country are in crisis and the pressure shows no sign of abating,’ he said.

‘Today we have yet more evidence that the situation has deteriorated significantly on this Government’s watch, with ambulance diverts up by a quarter in the last year.

‘This is a crisis of their own making. Instead of casting round for others to blame, David Cameron and Jeremy Hunt need to accept responsibility and develop an urgent plan to relieve the pressure.’

Labour obtained the figures on A&E ‘diverts’ from the House of Commons Library. These diverts are where a department has to temporarily close because they lack the physical space or staff capacity to deal with any additional patients.

In 2011/12 there were 287 such occasions when hospitals reached capacity and were unable to cope with new ambulances. A year later this had risen by 24 per cent to 357.

Over recent weeks, hospitals in London have been forced to turn ambulances away.

They include Queens, Newham and King George’s hospitals in east London, Whipps Cross and Northwick Park hospitals in north London, and the Princess Royal and Lewisham hospitals in south London.

The diversions occurred either when the ambulance was on the journey to hospital or in some cases after they have arrived. This wastes time for patients with emergency conditions before they can receive emergency care.

Now Liverpool has been added to the list.

John Heyworth, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, the body which represents A&E doctors, said: ‘The emergency department is the point in the system where the pressures of ever increasing demand and finite hospital capacity collide.

‘This leads to crowding in emergency departments and ambulance diversions. This is frustrating for our patients and difficult for clinicians to provide the prompt high quality care our patients expect and deserve.

Concerns: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham, pictured, called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to suspend all ongoing A&E closure proposals

‘Urgent action is both required and overdue to provide an emergency care system responsive to our patients’ needs.’

Labour is today holding an ‘emergency A&E summit’ to hear directly from staff about the pressures they face on a day-to-day basis.

Mr Burnham called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to suspend all ongoing A&E closure proposals pending a personal review of the latest evdience.

‘The facts on the ground are changing fast and call into question the wisdom and safety of closing so many A&Es across England,’ he said.

‘If convincing evidence can be produced to show lives can be saved by closing A&Es, Labour will not oppose them.

'But, as the pressure builds, the case is changing and the Health Secretary must err on the side of caution. The onus is on him to produce convincing evidence or drop these plans.’

He added: ‘Labour will present practical proposals to the Health Secretary which could help staff at the front line.

‘David Cameron and his Health Secretary have been caught out looking for scapegoats rather than finding solutions. They must cut the spin and get a grip without delay.’

When a divert is put in place, ambulances are told to take people elsewhere, although life-threatening cases are still accepted at the original hospital.

Official Department of Health guidance say they should only happen in exceptional circumstances.

‘Diversion of patients as a result of lack of physical or staff capacity to deal with attendances or admissions should be an action of last resort,’ it says.

Last night a government spokesman said: ‘The NHS is currently meeting the 4hr A&E waiting time target.

‘However, we know that over the past few years A&E has been put under increasing pressure because of rising demand.

'That is why this government is looking at how we address the long term problems facing A&E, something the Labour Party failed to do while they were in office.'
