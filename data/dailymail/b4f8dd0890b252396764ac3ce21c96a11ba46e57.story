YouTube has powered to a phenomenal one billion users every single month thanks to hits by Psy and Justin Bieber - and the perennially funny Charlie bit my finger.

Gangnam Style by Psy is the video 
sharing site's most popular clip ever, with nearly 1.5billion views in 
total as the billion-user milestone was announced last night at an event in Santa Monica, California.

That makes the South Korean rapper's breakthrough hit nearly twice as popular as the second place clip, the music video for Justin Bieber and Ludacris's hit track Baby.

Mass appeal: South Korean rapper Psy in his music video for the track Gangnam Style, which is far and away the most popular video on YouTube, the video-sharing website which has hit the one billion users a month mark

Oooh, baby baby: Gangnam Style has been viewed nearly 1.5billion times on YouTube

The only clip in the top ten not promoting a recording industry artist was the perennially amusing Charlie Bit My Finger - again !, which was the sixth most watched of all time with nearly 520million views.

No one artist had more than one video in the top ten and, other than the apparently universally appealing Gangnam Style, the only non-English language video was Brazilian folk singer Michel Teló's Ai Se Eu Te Pego!.

YouTube announced it had reached the billion users a month milestone at a swish event last night aimed at advertisers and featuring performances from some of the website's biggest stars.

Runner up: Baby, Canadian teen popper Justin Bieber's collaboration with southern U.S. rapper Ludacris, was the second most watched YouTube video of all time as the announcement was made

It crossed the threshold five months after online social network Facebook said it had reached that figure for the first time.

The vast audience - up from 800million a month in October 2011 - has given YouTube's owner Google another lucrative channel for selling online ads beyond its dominant internet search engine.

Google snapped up YouTube for $1.76billion (£1.16billion) in 2006 when the video site had an estimated 50million users worldwide.

YouTube has since late 2011 refocused
its site to prioritise watching along distinct channels of its 
creators. Such channels were seen as better allowing advertisers to 
focus on certain genres of content like beauty or music.

The
company in 2012 ploughed $100million (£659million) into funding 96 
channels to help them accelerate that growth, in many cases partnering 
with big-name Hollywood producers and directors.

Later, YouTube vowed to spend another $200million (£132million) marketing the channels to boost viewers.

But
last night's event focused largely on stars who made it big through 
YouTube before the new channel-funding strategy, such as Michelle Phan, a
video author who has been giving viewers make-up tips via the site 
since 2006.

Record-breaking: YouTube says more than one billion people are now visiting its online video site each month

Growth: Google (CEO Larry Page is pictured) bought YouTube for $1.76billion (£1.16billion)
in 2006 when the video site had an estimated 50million users worldwide 

YouTube 
vice-president Robert Kyncl, who is the company's global head of content
partnernships, admitted after the event that the channel funding 
strategy had not worked as well as hoped.

Asked whether the channel funding investment had paid off, Mr Kyncl said: 'Every year we reserve the right to get smarter.'

While
YouTube was committed to continuing to invest in content, he said, more
of such investment in the future would go to those channels that had 
already proven they can be successful at building an audience on their 
own.

'What we're looking for is the acceleration of those who are figuring out how to retail their content,' he said.
