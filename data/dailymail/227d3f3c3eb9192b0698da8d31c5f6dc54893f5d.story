Steven Gerrard's sending-off against Manchester United on Sunday was the eighth red card of his career, with seven coming for Liverpool and one for England. 

The Liverpool captain's dismissal, which came just 38 seconds after he came on from the bench at Anfield, was part of a disappointing afternoon for The Reds that saw them lose momentum in the race for a top-four finish in the Premier League. 

 Here are Gerrard's eight red cards...
