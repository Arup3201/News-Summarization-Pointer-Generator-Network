Chelsea are considering stumping up the staggering £60million Juventus want for Paul Pogba.

Manchester United, who had Pogba as a scholar, want to re-sign him – but not at that price.

However, Chelsea see the 21-year-old France international as a good investment, not least because his Premier League academy status, just like Cesc Fabregas, helps the club conform to UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules.

Target: Pogba's impressive performances for France and Juventus have caught Chelsea's attention

Expensive: Juventus are asking for £60m for the talented young midfielder but Chelsea are willing to pay

Pogba has been impressive during France’s run to the last 16 of the World Cup in Brazil where they take on Nigeria in Brasilia on Monday.

The midfielder left Old Trafford for Turin under a cloud two years ago, firing a parting shot at Sir Alex Ferguson.

Speaking to The Times last year, he said: ‘It was all down to Ferguson. I didn’t want to sign a contract as Ferguson didn’t play me, even though there were no midfielders there.

'He obviously thought I didn’t deserve the contract I asked for and didn’t put me in the team even though he had no midfield players, it was his choice.’

Pogba scored five goals in his first campaign with the Italian giants and followed that up with nine last season as Juventus won the Serie A title.

Value: Chelsea consider Pogba to be a strong investment because he trained in England with Manchester United

He would add further depth to an already extensive Chelsea midfield after Fabregas’ arrival from Barcelona for £30m earlier this month.

The Spain international fell out with coach Vicente del Bosque in Brazil as the world champions were embarassingly eliminated at the group stage.

Fabregas joins the likes of Oscar, Eden Hazard, Willian, Ramires and Nemanja Matic in the Stamford Bridge engine room.
