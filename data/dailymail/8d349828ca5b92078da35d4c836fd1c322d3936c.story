Louis van Gaal might have given his players a thumbs up at the end of another frenetic encounter, but it remains as much about crisis management as football management for the Dutchman at Manchester United.

He did his best to deny that at Old Trafford yesterday, daring to suggest Wayne Rooney received a red card for nothing more than ‘a professional foul’ and refusing to respond to the idea that it might have been a mistake to make him captain.

It was neither a good question, nor a good analysis of Rooney’s challenge on Stewart Downing, the Dutchman said. Even if Downing was deep in his own half, and 70 yards from United’s goal, when Rooney decided to plant his right foot in the West Ham midfielder’s thigh.

‘Crazy’ was how many saw it, but not Van Gaal. No, like Rooney, he somehow saw danger in Downing’s run. He was taken down because he needed to be, United’s manager essentially argued, with Rooney’s only mistake being the over-zealous nature of the tackle.

More seasoned Rooney watchers will have a different view of the sixth red card of his career.

We have seen this before; a senseless, seemingly unprovoked moment of madness that normally succeeds only in leaving a manager wondering if this hugely gifted footballer can be trusted. But even by Rooney’s standards this was extraordinary; enough surely to alarm a watching Roy Hodgson however blasé Van Gaal might have claimed to be about it.

In the end, in the isolated context of this game, it mattered not. The advantage United secured with first-half goals from Rooney and Robin van Persie was enough to see off a spirited West Ham side.

But Van Gaal must now prepare for three games, one at home against Everton and another against league leaders Chelsea at Old Trafford, without his captain at a time when leadership on the pitch is almost as important as the guidance he continues to provide off it. It was already proving another uncomfortable spectacle for Van Gaal as his side swung almost as violently between rapidly executed attacks and anxiety attacks at the opposite end of the field.

But attacks of a purely physical nature are the last thing he needs, when Rooney is so central a figure in a team still struggling to overcome the imbalance created by a brilliant forward line and an inexperienced defence.

In fairness to those charged with the task of defending United’s goal yesterday, they actually did rather well in the end. They were aided by the poor quality of West Ham’s finishing, but it was an improvement on last Sunday’s debacle at Leicester.

Patrick McNair, a 19-year-old from Northern Ireland, impressed on his debut in a back four boasting another debutant in Luke Shaw as well as a centre-half — Marcos Rojo — making only his third appearance for the club. If anything, McNair looked more assured than the more experienced Argentinian and was responsible for a marvellous headed clearance late in the second half.

Going forward, of course, United remain excellent, with Rooney outstanding at times in this game. It actually made his clash with Downing all the more bizarre. He should have been celebrating the 10th anniversary of his United debut with a fine performance as well as a goal that lifts him to third in the all-time list for the Premier League. United started, much as they did at Leicester last week, with what amounted to a commanding attacking display that simply proved too much for their opponents.

They were ahead after only five minutes, Rooney meeting a bouncing cross from Rafael with a marvellous first-time strike that curled beyond the reach of keeper Adrian.

No sooner had United’s captain settled the nerves at Old Trafford, however, than a defensive error very nearly led to an equaliser for the visitors. A poorly directed backpass from an otherwise impressive Daley Blind suddenly invited Enner Valencia to strike, but the West Ham forward blasted over.

It was a combination of defensive errors that then enabled Van Persie to double United’s lead in the 22nd minute. A poor clearance from Adrian was compounded when Alex Song lost possession to Ander Herrera. He passed to Radamel Falcao, who in turn found Van Persie with a superb pass. Even then, though, Winston Reid was too hesitant in challenging Van Persie and the Dutchman beat Adrian with a delightful right-foot strike.

Angel di Maria really should have made it 3-0 but sent an effort wide and the mistake was made to feel all the more costly when Diafra Sakho seized on the mess United made of defending a Downing corner in the 37th minute.

David de Gea was most at fault for flapping ineffectively at the ball under pressure from Morgan Amalfitano, and after Valencia saw his initial header bounce off the crossbar Sakho was there to pounce with a more accurate effort. De Gea made amends when he denied Sakho after the break, and in the end credit should be given to a makeshift defence that just about protected that one-goal margin.

But Van Gaal will also know Sam Allardyce’s side were not as impressive as they had been against Liverpool the previous week. West Ham’s manager was also bitterly disappointed with his side’s failure to take advantage of Rooney’s red card.

Afterwards Allardyce also blamed the match officials for ruling that Kevin Nolan was offside when he converted Carl Jenkinson’s cross from close range with little more than a minute remaining. It was certainly a close call from the officials which, on another day, could have gone in the visitors’ favour.

To be fair to Allardyce, his argument was nothing like as bizarre as his opposite number’s.
