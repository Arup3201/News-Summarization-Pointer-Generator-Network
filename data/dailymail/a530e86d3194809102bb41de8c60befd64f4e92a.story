The Duchess of Cornwall rewarded a day spent visiting community food projects in east London with a trip to Mayfair's illustrious fish restaurant Scott's.

Camilla was having lunch with family and friends of the food writer - including Elton John and Ronnie Wood - to celebrate her son Tom Parker-Bowles' 38th birthday.

Earlier the duchess had visited Bethnal Green and Peckham with her husband Prince Charles to pack Christmas food hampers and learn about food banks.

It may not be quite Fortnum and Mason, but Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were happy to roll up their sleeves and pack Christmas hampers today.

And they had residents of the east London estate they were visiting in stitches as 
they cracked jokes and chatted freely on a pre-Christmas tour of the 
area.

The royal pair appeared full of festive cheer as they visited the Hollybush Estate in Bethnal Green, where derelict patches of the site have been transformed into thriving vegetable and fruit allotments as part of a community project.

Posing for a photo with one resident, Charles warned: 'It will ruin your reputation!'

Later
 he had locals in giggles as he joked about everything from the 
difficulties of getting 'couch potatoes' to volunteer to his slow speed 
at packing Christmas hampers.

As they packed bags of produce in
 - appropriately - the Hollybush Estate community centre, which will be 
distributed to the elderly and needy, Charles looked astonished at his 
wife's prodigious output.

'Have you really done all these, 
darling?' he asked. Brandishing a couple in her hand, Camilla joked: 
'Here's one I made earlier.'

The future king giggled uncontrollably as he fumbled with some gold ribbon. 'Hee hee, I am really hopeless at this,' he said.

'Leave it to the expert,' his wife retorted.

Margaret Cox, the chair of the local 
Tenants and Residents Association who came up with the idea of the 
allotments, led Charles on the tour and praised his quick wit.

She 
said: 'We just laughed about everything to be perfectly honest. Wicked 
sense of humour. Absolutely wonderful sense of humour.'

She said the Prince had made a couple of jokes as they walked the estate, but decided to keep them to herself.

The
 couple began their day at 'Rocky Gardens', a former playground that was
 badly vandalised and turned into a community vegetable garden.

Among
 those waiting to meet them was Mary Deppe, who has live on the estate 
for 37 years, and had the Duchess in hysterics as she nervously muddled 
up her welcome speech.

'You are such a nice lady,' she told the royal.

The
 good mood was shared by the residents of the 1,900-people estate, some 
of whom peered over balconies to take photos and waved at the Prince and
 Duchess.

As they walked through the estate 
Charles and Camilla chatted with locals over the garden fence including 
Kenneth Summerston, 49,Â  and his mother Margaret Donnell, 71.

Mr Summerson, a 49-year-old greengrocer who has lived on
 the estate for four decades, held out a parking permit before their 
arrival and joked: 'Will he need one of these?'

When Mr Summerson 
eventually met Charles he told him that they shared the same birthday. 
'Nice to meet a fellow Scorpion,' Charles replied, according to Mr 
Summerson.

The Prince and Duchess were shown parts of the estate 
which used to be focal points for anti-social behaviour, but which now 
feature allotments where residents currently grow carrots, onions and 
cabbages.

One of the areas they saw, Rocky Gardens, was opened in 
April 2009 and is part of the Capital Growth scheme which provides free 
plots to residents to grow their own produce.

Back
 at the community centre Charles told local residents at how impressed 
he was by what they had achieved as he packed bags with home grown 
carrots and kale.

The pair met those 
involved in running the allotments and helped pack the produce in 
Christmas hampers for the elderly and disabled. They also donated some 
Duchy Originals biscuits for the packs.

Secretary
 of the tenants and residents association, Sarah Beydoun, told him that 
the estate had been plagued by drug dealing, prostitution, anti social 
behaviour and graffiti until they had started transforming run down 
space into pretty gardens four years ago.

'People come out and talk to each 
other now, crime is down and even the drug dealers keep an eye on things
 as their families play on the gardens, it has really transformed 
everyone's lives,' she said.

As the couple left they waved and wished everyone a Happy Christmas.

'I
 can't wait to spend the time with my five grandchildren,' the Duchess 
told Mail Online. 'It will be absolute chaos but lovely.'

Camilla
 will be attending the royal family's traditional Christmas celebrations
 at Sandringham in Norfolk but normally leaves on Boxing Day to be with 
her own family in Wiltshire.

The Prince and Duchess ended 
the visit by greeting a crowd of excited residents, before heading off 
to a Christmas celebration being held by volunteers in Peckham, south 
London.

In Peckham, the Prince and Duchess 
were entertained by a steel band as they met residents and volunteers at
 a festive event at the Everlasting Arms Ministry, where earlier a new 
charity food bank had been launched.

During
 the visit the royals were sung Do You Hear What I Hear? by 
schoolchildren from Camelot Primary School, and listened to a poem about
 aspirations for young people.

Hundreds
 of locals turned up to the lively event, according to community 
organiser Nicholas Okwulu, who accompanied the royals through their 
visit and described the event as a great success.

Mr
 Okwulu said: 'It went really, really well. People enjoyed themselves...
 [The royals] more or less spoke to everyone. People just loved it.'
