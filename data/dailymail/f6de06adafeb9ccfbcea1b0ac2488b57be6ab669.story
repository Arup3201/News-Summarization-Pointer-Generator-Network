US Army Green Berets have made a bleak  assessment of Afghan National Army soldiers after a doomed mission this year when many of the soldiers refused to show up and those who did refused to fight and hid behind rocks.

The Afghan forces reportedly could not operate at night and were so unprepared that the Americans had to take the lead. Then, when the mission was only half finished, the Afghan soldiers quit, retreated to the trees and refused to push on.

The Special Forces soldiers, among the most elite and best-trained in the US military, filed those reports in a declassified Pentagon briefing about the June friendly fire bombinh that left five Americans and one Afghan soldier dead.

Unprepared: A report by Green Beret officers paints a bleak picture of Afghan National Army preparedness as American forces prepare to pull out

Green Berets: Special Forces soldiers are some of the most highly trained commandos in the US military with specialized skills for working with local soldiers like the Afghan National Army

A captain from Fifth Special Forces Group based out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, reported the dramatic shortcomings of Afghan soldiers as he defended the actions of his own troops, the Washington Times reports.  

His assessment is sharply different from the picture of the Afghan National Army projected by the Pentagon as the US military. 

Notably, Special Forces soldiers are specifically trained and educated on how to instruct and work with foreign soldiers in their own country. It is the primary mission of the Green Berets, which they have been performing around the world since the 1950s.

On Sunday, the American-led coalition formally ended combat operations in the volatile Helmand Province and US Marines and British troops handed over their bases there to Afghan commanders. 

All but 12,500 coalition troops will pull out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014, leaving the ANA to protect the fragile nation from a resurgent Taliban. 

According to the Times, the mission on June 5 began badly when far fewer Afghan troops showed up than had been requested by the Green Berets.

'They do not always show up with the forces promised. This was not ideal,' the American officer wrote.

Too few Afghan soldiers show up, and those who do show up are often reluctant to fight, the Green Berets claimed in a new report

The mission was to clear a valley of Taliban fighters so that local residents could vote in the Afghan election. The insurgents had vowed to attack polling places and voters in an attempt to scare Afghans away. 

When the troops were flown into the valley, the captain writes, 'the (Green Berets) took point due to the ANA’s inability to move during periods of darkness.'

As the forces began clearing the valley, the Green Berets noted that most of the soldiers refused to move out in the open and instead hid in the 'green zone' - a swath of protected trees. 

Midway through the mission, the Green Berets report, the Afghan soldiers just gave up.  

'The (Green Berets) recommended to the (Afghan commander) to move positions and continue clearing further down the valley. The (commander) claimed to have cleared the entire valley but our positions identified that they had cleared only half of the valley. According to the (commander) that was as much clearance as they were going to conduct.'

Then, after an American bomber killed five Americans and an Afghan in a friendly fire accident, the Green Berets told the remaining Afghan soldiers to form a perimeter so that the rescue and recovery operation could begin. 

'They instead huddled behind a rock,' a Green Beret wrote. 

Defense Department investigators largely blamed the Special Forces soldiers for the errant bombing in the report, which was released last month. They said that the elite soldiers had 'poor situational awareness'  when they called in the air strike. The bomber crew was blamed for failing to correctly identify the target.
