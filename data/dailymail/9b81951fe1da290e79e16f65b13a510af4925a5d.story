Researchers believe companies could save millions of pounds by analysing the emails of suspected employers

The most common words used by rogue traders and fraudsters when emailing about their plans at work have been revealed by investigators working with the FBI.

'Cover up', 'write off', 'illegal', and 'failed investment' were used most often by employees carrying out rogue trading and fraud.

Ernst & Young's Fraud Investigation and Dispute Services Practice collaborated with the FBI  using specialist software to identify more than 3,000 terms.

Researchers say the analysis of emails written by employees under suspicion could save companies millions of pounds by flagging  concerns before money is lost through fraud.

Fraud investigators said that suspicious terms such as 'nobody will find out', 'grey area' and 'they owe it to me' were also among the most used phrases.

'Special fees' and 'friendly payments' were regularly used in bribery cases and phrases such as 'do not volunteer information' revealed concern at getting caught out.

Rashmi Joshi, director of the company's Fraud Investigation and Disputes Services, said the research and new technology can help businesses identify rogue trader behaviour earlier.

Cover up

Write off

Illegal

Failed investment

Nobody will find out

Grey area

They owe it to me

Do not volunteer information

Off the books

Backdate

No inspection

Special fees

Friendly payments

She said regulators or investigators normally only seize upon telling email traffic when 'the damage has been done'.

She told ComputerWeekly.com: 'Firms are increasingly seeking to proactively search for 
specific trends and red flags – initially anonymously –but with the 
potential for investigation where a consistent pattern of potential 
fraud is flagged.'

Shee told the website that analysis of language and statistics can help 'identify rogue trader behaviour' in a cost effective way, as well other fraud, abuse and employee misconduct.

Also in the research, investigators found that employees often disclose their reservations about the plans with phrases such as 'want no part of this' and 'don't leave a trail'.

They also try to rationalise their behaviour in emails by saying 'not hurting anyone', 'won't miss it', 'fix it later' and 'told me to'.

The specialist software used by investigators also scanned for phrases that showed the writer did not want to leave a trail, such as 'call my mobile' or 'come by my office'.

It was also used to track and highlight changes in tone and language.

Among the top phrases used by rogue employees in email were 'cover up', 'write off' and 'illegal', 'failed investment' and 'nobody will find out'
