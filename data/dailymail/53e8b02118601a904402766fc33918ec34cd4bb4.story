At first glance, it is very much like any other beaded necklace, complete with a simple row of gems.

But on closer inspection, this rare Amber necklace is revealed as nature's very own time caspule, with each chunky bead home to an ancient bug.

The simple chain, made out 40 million year old gems, has a collection of mosquitoes, ants, and spiders encased inside.
