A footballing body today admitted it was embarrassed over the 'gross error of judgement' that saw comedian Reginald D Hunter repeatedly using racist slurs during his act at an awards dinner.

Hunter, a black stand-up from Georgia in the U.S., used the word 'n*****' a number of times during his 30-minute performance at the Grosvenor Hotel in central London yesterday.

Professional Footballers' Association chairman Clarke Carlisle said: 'I thought that we made a really gross error of judgement in who we selected for our entertainment last night. I was embarrassed.’

He added that he ‘apologised 
unreservedly’, saying: ‘All that has gone on in football over the past 
few years, with everything that we purport to stand for, his set was 
inappropriate, it really was.

Carlisle said: 'My experience of him 
is on the satirical shows where he is probably milder than he is down 
the comedy club. But last night it wasn’t a comedy club.

‘It is the showpiece of the year where
you have got the whole spectrum of races and cultures and the whole 
spectrum of the footballing family.’

It came after a year when the PFA has 
been at the centre of race storms involving John Terry, Ashley Cole, 
Anton Ferdinand, Rio Ferdinand and Luis Suarez.

Amazingly, the comedian opened his act with a joke about Suarez, one of six players named on the official PFA shortlist. He used the word around 10 times in just the first minute of his act.

The Liverpool striker was banned for 
eight games when he racially abused Patrice Evra and was an invited 
guest at the annual dinner.

Former England caption John Terry also received a ban 
for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, although he was cleared of racism in a criminal trial.

Ferdinand's brother, Manchester United defender Rio, was among the guests at the lavish ceremony.

Anti-racism campaigner Paul Elliott, who 
had to step down from his role at the FA in February following reports 
that he racially abused footballer Richard Rufus, was also in the room 
at the time of Hunter’s speech.

Reginald D Hunter, 44, is a U.S. comedian from Albany, Georgia, who has been living in Britain for almost two decades.

The former theatre student’s 
website says he ‘makes people uncomfortable, shaking their suppositions 
and airing plenty of his own dirty laundry’.

It adds that his ‘early life 
experiences as a boy growing up in the Deep South influence his work and
sharply contrast with his life as an American black man in England’.

He released his first DVD two years ago and played a sold-out tour across the UK in 2011.

He won the Writers’ Guild Award for
Comedy in 2006 for his show Pride and Prejudice… and N*****, and did a 
tour named Trophy N****.

But his website states: ‘Many venues wouldn’t post the name of the show and the London Underground banned the promo posters’.

He has appeared on Live at the 
Apollo on BBC 1, 8 Out of 10 Cats on Channel 4 and the BBC Radio 4 
comedy show The Unbelievable Truth.

The PFA was last night forced to defend 
its decision to book the 44-year-old comedian, who is known to regularly use the 
offensive term during his shows.

FA chairman David Bernstein was one 
of the dignitaries who squirmed his way through Hunter’s extraordinary 
act. The comedian also admitted that his act had not gone down well with
guests.

PFA chiefs have made huge strides in recent years with anti-racism initiatives. Chief
executive Gordon Taylor has defended the decision to book Hunter 
despite the comedian regularly using the offensive term during his acts.

When asked whether it was a mistake to
allow Hunter to perform PFA chief executive Taylor replied: 'No, no, 
don't be silly. Are you serious?

'I
think there were a few raised eyebrows over the comedian, but that is 
the sort of thing you can’t control. It was unfortunate. He is a 
professional comedian.

'It’s a difficult subject in football and
with him not being fully aware of how emotive it has been in football, 
that was probably a difficulty for him.'

But Carlisle was furious with the act yesterday and had promised to speak out about the extraordinary booking.

Carlisle
admitted he didn't know who booked the act, but vowed to find out how 
the black American comedian was at the event televised by Sky Sports.

Popular: Hunter appeared on the BBC's current affairs show Have I Got News For You on Friday night

Hunter is a popular comedian who is known for his jokes on racism and has 
regularly appeared on stand-up shows and the BBC's current affairs 
programme Have I Got News For You.

Tottenham winger Gareth Bale, 23, was crowned player of the year at the awards.

He became just the 
third player in history to win that gong and the Young 
Player of the Year award on the same evening.

The Welshman beat Robin van Persie, Luis Suarez, Juan Mata, Michael 
Carrick and Eden Hazard to win the highly-coveted senior award, which he
also clinched two seasons ago.
