This is the amazing moment where a baby bear runs from the woods onto the green of a golf course and begins performing circus tricks. 

Two other baby bears remain on the edge of the green as their more adventurous sibling makes his way to the flag. 

The bear quickly reaches out to the flag and rears up onto his hind legs.  

The adventurous baby bear approaches the flag marking the pin with a certain degree of trepidation 

The bear grasps the pole with his paw as two of his more nervous siblings watch from the edge of the green

After about one minute, he starts pulling down the flag and begins dancing around in a circle. Then he changes to a forward and back motion. 

The bear was spotted by Andi Dzilums as he played with friends at the Fairmont Hot Springs' golf course in British Columbia, Canada.

Mr Dzilums said: 'It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing to see this amazing baby bear playing like all kids do!' 

At one stage the bear pulls the pole down towards the ground and attempts to chew on the red flag. 

He then releases the flag which springs up at some considerable speed. 

Soon the bear starts climbing on the pole before beginning his unusual dance routine and swinging around

The bear then decides it wants to play with the flag and pulls down on the flag bending it over 

Standing on his hind legs, the bear begins to swing around on the pole before trying to bite the red flag 

Having lost interest in the flag, the bear then spots one of the player's golf balls which was lying a tricky 12-foot putt from the hole. 

The bear bounds over to the bright yellow ball and takes it into its mouth before retreating to the edge of the green. 

The video, which was posted on YouTube, has been viewed almost 625,000 times.  

Eventually the bear gets bored playing with the pole and instead decides to investigate the yellow golf ball 

Unfortunately for the golfers, the bear picks up the ball and trudges over to the edge of the green
