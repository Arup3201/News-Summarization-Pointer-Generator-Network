Historic: Mrs Justice Eleanor King has sanctioned the first sterilisation of a man in this country because it is 'in his best interests'

A disabled man will have to be sterilised because it would damage his life to have any more children, a judge ruled yesterday. 

Mrs Justice Eleanor King said the man, who has a mental age of between six and nine years, was deeply distressed when his girlfriend became pregnant four years ago.

The child is now being looked after by his grandmother.

However the judge decided sterilisation ‘was in his best interests’ as he could not be relied on to use condoms or other birth control methods to prevent another pregnancy.

The 36-year-old, who can only be referred to as DE, is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend – who also has learning difficulties. 

While he is dependent on his parents, the court heard that he had got to the stage where he could catch a bus, go swimming, or go and buy a coffee by himself.

The judge made it clear that DE’s relationship with his girlfriend, which was disrupted by her pregnancy, should be supported and the couple ‘should be permitted to resume their sexual relationship’.

But she said that having another child would threaten his hard-earned independence. 

And she insisted that the vasectomy would let him have ‘as normal a life as possible as soon as possible’.

‘DE is unequivocal in expressing his wish not to have any more children,’ she said.

The application to Mrs Justice Eleanor King, sitting in the Court of Protection, was made by DE's local NHS Trust with support from his parents, his GP and the local authority involved in his care

Claiming the ruling would be in his 
best interests, she added: ‘DE’s hard-earned achievements, whether they 
are learning to swim by imitation as he can’t process spoken 
instruction, or getting a bus on his own, must be treasured.’

The
 application to sanction a vasectomy had been made by the man’s NHS 
trust, supported by his parents, GP and the local authority that 
organised his care.

The ruling in the Court of Protection is the first that has seen a judge order a man to be sterilised.

The
 decision is the latest in a series of controversial judgements made by 
the court, which has been criticised for making secret rulings about 
people who are unable to manage their own affairs.
