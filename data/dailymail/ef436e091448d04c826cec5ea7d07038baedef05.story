The Conservatives are to repeat a pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, despite utterly failing to meet it during the last five years.

Home Secretary Theresa May insisted the target was 'important', even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year - three times what David Cameron promised.

The net migration target is now set to be included in the Tory manifesto for May's general election, after Mrs May and Mr Cameron rejected repeated warnings that it was a mistake. 

A total of 298,000 more people arrived in Britain than left in the year to September, as the numbers arriving from the rest of the EU hit a record high.

Before the last election Mr Cameron pledged to cut the figure below 100,000, a promise he repeated in 2011: 'No ifs. No buts.'

A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. 

Senior Tories including William Hague last week tried to claim the failure to meet the target was a 'problem of success' because workers from struggling European economies were flocking to booming Britain.

But calls have grown for the Tories to ditch the pledge, because the government is unable to control the numbers arriving from the EU. 

Senior figures, including Chancellor George Osborne, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea. 

Former home secretary Ken Clarke said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet, while Baroness Warsi, an ex-Tory party chairwoman, said it was 'unrealistic'.

Now Mrs May has signalled that she intends to include a pledge on net migration in the Conservative manifesto. 

'I think we will keep the target,' she told The Times. 'It is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system but also about making sure that those people who shouldn't live here actually leave.'

She added: 'You will have to wait for the manifesto to see the exact words. The idea of the net migration target will still be there.'

Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier

Net migration from the EU hit 162,000 in the year ending September 2014, up from 130,000 in the previous year

'We would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.' David Cameron, Jan 2010

'Levels of immigration can return to where they were in the 1980s and 90s. Net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year. No ifs. No buts. That's a promise we made to the British people.' David Cameron, April 2011

'When we made that comment ... we were very clear that was what we wanted to do. It remains the objective towards which the Prime Minister and others are working.' Theresa May, Nov 10

'It is, of course, unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament.' Theresa May, Nov 23

She also sought to put pressure on other Cabinet ministers, with a warning that the impact of immigration is felt across Whitehall. 

Mrs May said: 'Obviously the Home Office is responsible for UK visas and immigration, the Border Force and immigration enforcement but actually immigration is an issue that touches across government departments and has a whole number of different aspects.

'It affects issues around jobs, questions of illegal working, access to housing, education, the NHS.

'It touches all government departments and I think that's the thing that's important.'

Downing Street blames the increase on the number of people moving from within the EU, which the government cannot control.

Ministers have argued that immigration from outside the EU has been falling as a result of tighter border restrictions. 

However, non-EU net migration is at its highest level since the end of December 2011.

Mrs May revealed she faced a battle with officials to get them to accept that immigration could cause problems.

'There was a problem with the orthodoxy in Whitehall when we came into government in 2010,' she said.

'It was the idea that immigration by definition was good - in that automatically if you've got more people, GDP goes up.

'Of course, GDP per head doesn't necessarily go up - so they didn't look beyond that point.'  

Prime Minister David Cameron promised before the election to cut net immigration in the tens of thousands

Former home secretary Ken Clarke said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet, while Baroness Warsi, an ex-Tory party chairwoman, said it was 'unrealistic'

Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron's 'ambition' to reduce net migration below 100,000 remained.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'You won't be surprised to know that he takes a different view from Ken on this one. It won't be the first time that he and Ken haven't had exactly the same views.'

The spokesman said the Prime Minister's views on the need to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 had not changed since a speech in November, when he said that it remained an 'ambition', even if it was not possible to achieve it during this Parliament. 

When the latest figures were released last week, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said the Tories must now 'quite rightly suffer the embarrassment' of breaking the promise. 

Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future think tank, said: 'If the Prime Minister remains in denial about the broken target, he is setting himself up for five more years of failure. It is already clear there is next to no chance of meeting the same target in the next Parliament either.

'It's absurd to think that anyone would believe this broken promise if it's made again.

'There is a simple political moral to this tale: careless promises cost trust.'
