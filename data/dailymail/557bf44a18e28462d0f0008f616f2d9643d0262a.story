A taxi driver who picked up three murder suspects less than ten minutes after a 16-year-old was stabbed to death in central London could hold information key to the killing, detectives say.

Police want to speak to the motorist who picked up the trio of youths in Hudson Place, Victoria, at 6.59pm on Sunday January 27.

Nine minutes earlier, 16-year old Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir was chased and stabbed to death by a gang in nearby Lupus Street, Pimlico.

Lead: Scotland Yard want to speak to the driver of this silver cab, who picked up three people nine minutes after the murder of teenager Hani Abou El Kheir in Pimlico, central London

Death: Hani Abou El Kheir, was stabbed shortly before 7pm on Sunday January 27 and despite the efforts of emergency workers and doctors he died in a south London hospital

The cab was a silver London taxi, which turned left onto Wilton Place after picking up the men.

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Attewell of the Homicide and SeriousCrime Command [HSCC], appealed for the cabbie to come forward.

He said: 'Just over a week on from the murder of HaniHicham Abou El Kheir the investigation team is working tirelessly to identify not only those we believe to be responsible for Haniâ€™s deathbut any potential witnesses who will be able to assist us with our investigation.

'We are exploring numerous lines of enquires, with this latest development being one of them. I am appealing to the driver of the silver taxi seen in Hudson Place at 18:59 on that Sunday to comeforward.

Horrific: The 16-year-old died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico, one of London's most affluent neighbourhoods, a week last Sunday evening

Grieving: Family members including Hani's mother Pauline Hickey, pictured with her hood up, lay flowers next to the scene where he was stabbed

'Are you that taxi driver? Where did you drop the passengers off and did they discuss anything of significance whilst in the taxi?

Hunt: Police believe the taxi driver being searched for could have vital information related to the death of Hani Abou El Kheir

'I am also seeking the assistance of the wider taxi community. With a taxi rank close by there would have been other drivers who may have witnessed the suspects getting into the silver taxi.

'Did you see one of your colleagues pick up three people around this time or do you recognise the taxi?

'Despite it being a Sunday evening the area around Victoria Station was fairly busy and a number of people would have seen the three people getting into the taxi before it made its way towards Wilton Road. If you saw anything please do come forward and help us with our enquiries.'

The taxi is possibly a T2 or T4 model with colour coded bumpers and black trim around the door and bumper.

Nine people have been arrested in connection with the murder. One man, arrested on suspicion of murder last week, has been bailed until March.

Four other men were arrested on Saturday on suspicion of murder. A man and three women have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

The scene of the murder has become a shrine to Hani's short life.

A note from the victim's mother, Pauline Hickey, was left with flowers where he died.

It read: 'My baby. My heart is broken. I love you so much, the pain is unbearable. Your loving mother.'

Another tribute attached to a nearby bus stop was a copy of a touching note written by Hani to his mother, alongside a picture of him as a child.

It said: 'Thank you for being the best mum. Love to mummy, thank you for everything. Love from Hani.'

The tribute was signed by relatives including the teenager's grandparents, and cousins in Ireland.

The inquest, officially opened and adjourned by Coroner Jean Harkin officially, will resume at a later date once the police investigation has concluded.

Any witnesses or anyone with any information should contact the incident room on 0208 345 3715 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
