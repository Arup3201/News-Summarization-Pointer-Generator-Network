 In the final nail-biting minute of the show he was asked the following historical question: 'The Burke and Wills expedition left Melbourne in which year?' 

The trivia buff correctly answered '1860' but said it left like a 'lifetime' before the big green tick rolled around, signalling a triumphant end to an extremely nerve-racking month.

As his wife of 19 years, Jenny, joined him on stage for his winning moment on Friday afternoon, Mr Skarbek, from Hawthorn, Victoria, said although it would 'take a while to sink in', all he felt was overwhelming relief.

‘It’s incredible! I think at this stage it’s more relief than anything seeing as it's been such a long process,‘ Mr Skarbek said.

He admitted it's been a 'hard slog' but he relished the challenge and knew he wanted to take it all the way.

'It's about more than the money now. It's about proving to myself that I can do it,' he said.

 Being the curious man he is Mr Skarbek said if he walked away with the smaller jackpots of $500,000 or $750,000, he would never have stopped wondering if he could have made it to the million.

‘I know I could have lived with taking the risk. If you’re prepared and back yourself, you can live with loosing.'

He was adamant that not knowing that would have eaten him alive.

Mr Skarbek was quick to recognise he wasn't alone on his million dollar journey, crediting his wife for supporting and coaching him through the month long adventure.  

'She would stay up asking me questions until 2 in the morning, until it felt like our eyes bled,’ he said. 

Becoming the longest standing contestant on the show Mr Skarbek spent 23 episodes on Million Dollar Minute in what he calls his 'million dollar month’

'She would stay up asking me questions until 2 in the morning, until it felt like our eyes bled,’ he said. 

The humble winner said it was hard for him to believe he'd achieved 'permanent financial security and become the biggest winner in Australian quiz show history.

'It will change our lives but we are pretty down to earth and I know it wont change us.’ 

Mr Skarbek hit financial trouble after being diagnosed with mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma which required an expensive twice-weekly blood transfusion. 

Mr Skarbek, who spent years dragging his wife Jenny to pub trivia nights, got into debt when he had to pay sky-high medical bills to treat his cancer 

His six-month treatment cost $50,000, putting further strain on the couple who said they were trapped in the renting cycle.

'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow-out on medical bills with my six-month cancer treatment. Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said.  

Things started to turn around when Mr Skarbek was given a clean bill of health and was told he had got on to the the show in the same week.

'Sometimes you get in a rut. You know things will improve eventually but it's hard to see how. Then I got the great medical news and found out I was going to make the show,' he said.

'A whole series of things just started coming my way.'

With a 'life-changing' amount of money now sitting in his bank account Mr Skarbek said, after years of renting, he can't wait to become a home owner. 

'When we were younger and had the chance to buy a house we could never find the perfect property. Then the market went berserk and although we were saving like crazy, we were shut out.’

‘This will be the house that trivia built,’ he joked. 

After buying a home Mr Skarbek says he'll use some of the prize money to take his wife around the world

Having a good understanding what it's like to struggle financially Mr Skarbek said his wife was adamant they share their good fortune by making a generous donation to the Smith Family.

'Jenny was thinking about how tough some people do it and what a magical thing it would be to win that money and help someone else that's in need,' he said. 

Not only will they satisfy their own wanderlust with a trip around the word, Mr Skarbek said his mother hasn’t been back to her native Poland in 15 years and said he cant wait to send the 78-year-old home in style, on a business class flight.

Mr Skarbek says his 78-year-old mother Sophie has always supported him and now it's his turn to repay the favour by sending her back to her native Poland for a holiday after 15 years

Mr Skarbek, pictured as a child with family members, said travelling the world was the 'greatest gift' he was given 

A young Mr Skarbek was nicknamed 'The Professor'

Surprisingly, Mr Skarbek said he wasn't a particularly good student at school, instead saying he inherited his thirst for knowledge from his father.

'Ever since I was a little kid a lot of my family used to nickname me 'The Professor'. I was always reading,' he said. 

He spent his younger years travelling the world with his family which he said was the 'greatest gift' he was ever given.

Mr Skarbek said he has been an avid trivia player at his local pub for as long as he can remember and was elated to find his years of training could be put to good use.

'This is the only chance I've had to actually do something with my trivia skills,' he said.

After spending 15 years in the energy industry Mr Skarbek said he can't wait to leave his job and spend some time relaxing with his family. 

‘I have moments where I know it’s happened and I have moments where sometimes it feels like a dream.’ 

Mr Skarbek is the first Million Dollar Minute contestant to win the million dollar jackpot with his jackpot including $16,000 in ‘safe money’ he accumulated during the games.
