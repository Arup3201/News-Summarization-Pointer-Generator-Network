The Everton squad were put through their paces at the club's Finch Farm training ground on Tuesday ahead of the Toffees' Premier League curtain raiser against Leicester on Saturday.

Roberto Martinez's men kick off the campaign against the newly-promoted Foxes at the King Power Stadium as they bid to improve on last term's fifth-placed finish.

Blues boss Martinez hopes new £28million signing Romelu Lukaku will be fit enough for the season opener while their are also fitness concerns over right-sided pair Kevin Mirallas and Seamus Coleman.

All three players have trained with the first-team squad and Martinez is hopeful the trio can prove their fitness in time for this weekend's clash.

Speaking to the Everton website, Martinez said on Tuesday: 'All three are going to train normally with the team today, so we need to assess how they are and how they go through the week before any decisions are made on Saturday.

'It's really good to see Rom and Kevin reaching a really good level of fitness so quickly, but we don't know yet if they're going to be ready for the weekend.

'Seamus is training with the team and had the 'all okay' from a scan yesterday, so that's very good news as well.'

The camp in the Blue half of Merseyside appeared to be in good spirits as players were snapped sharing a joke during a passing session while goalkeepers Tim Howard and Joel Robles were hard at work.

Meanwhile, Everton have agreed a deal to sign Chelsea midfielder Christian Atsu on a season-long loan deal, according to manager Roberto Martinez.

Sportsmail revealed on Friday that the Toffees had arranged for the Ghana international to spend the 2014/15 campaign at Goodison Park, something Martinez has now confirmed.

The details of the loan agreement have been sorted between the two clubs, with a work permit the only thing preventing Atsu from becoming Everton's fifth signing of the summer.
