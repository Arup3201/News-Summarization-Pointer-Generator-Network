Killed: Shaaliver Douse, 14, was killed by police early Sunday. Officers say he pointed a gun at them

The gun found on the body of a 14-year-old boy shot dead by NYPD cops earlier this month was originally purchased at a Kentucky gun show the same year the slain teen was born.

Federal investigators, hoping to learn how the 9mm Astra semi-automatic pistol got into the hands of young Shaaliver Douse, have tracked the gun back to Brian Quigley, of Crestview, Kentucky.

Quigley bought the gun from T&J Sporting Goods in 1997 - the very same year that Shaaliver was born in the Bronx, New York.

Quigley told the New York Daily News he gave the Spanish-made pistol to his roommate as partial payment for rent he owed.

'That gun was a piece of s***,' he said.

When told that the gun had made it all the way to New York and was used by a teenager, Quigley was shocked.

'That’s crazy. I can’t believe that gun made it all the way out there,' he said.

Quigley said he 'thought' his roommate handled the transfer paperwork on the pistol - though federal investigators found that the last recorded transaction for the gun was in 1997 when Quigley purchased it legally.

Quigley's former roommate reportedly told investigators that the gun was stolen, though he never filed a theft report on the weapon.

Quigley, however, said the roommate sister was involved with people in gangs in New York and Florida. Scroll down for video

The NYPD says a rookie white police office shot and killed Shaaliver August 4 after the teenager raised the pistol and fired when two officers commanded him to stop and drop the weapon.

Police released a gory picture of the black gun covered in the boy's blood.

The New York City Police Commissioner, Ray Kelly, concedes that the teen may be the youngest person ever killed by the NYPD.

Despite the tragic young age of Shaaliver, Kelly was quick to defend the 26-year-old officer, who just graduated from the police academy last month.

Kelly said the teen had fired multiple rounds and was chasing someone through the streets of the Bronx about 3am Sunday.

When two officers confronted him, he refused to drop the pistol and pointed it at them, the Commissioner said at a press conference Sunday evening.

The officer fired a single round from his 9mm service pistol, striking Shaaliver in the jaw and killing him.

Police sources told the New York Times that they believe Shaaliver was pursuing a gang rival.

Detectives believe the incident was also
related to the shooting of a 15-year-old boy on May 24, only a mile and a half from where he was shot on Sunday.

In that incident Shaaliver was arrested and charged with attempted murder. The Bronx District Attorney didn't prosecute after the victim couldn't identify Shaaliver, according to the Daily News.

Farrar said of the victim: 'This person can't keep their story straight.'

Shaaliver was also due a court appearance later in August from a weapons possession arrest in October.

Douse threw a loaded revolver to the ground on October 10, as reported to the Daily News.

The
NYPD released a picture of an Astra 9mm semiautomatic pistol covered in
the boy's blood after his shooting on Sunday- in an effort to prove 
that he was armed at the time he was killed.

The department also produced surveillance video that purportedly shows Shaaliver in a white t-shirt running toward a man standing in 
front of a bodega and opening fire.

A second video 
shows Shaaliver chasing the target around the corner. It was there that 
the teen was confronted by police.

When Kelly was asked whether the Bronx teen was the youngest person ever killed by a New York police officer, he hesitated.

'I don't recall any other at this juncture. There may have been, I just don't recall,' he said, according to the New York Post.

Despite this show of evidence, his family has denied that the 14-year-old boy was involved in gangs and said the NYPD is trying to whitewash the killing.

'They're making it all up. There was no gun. It’s all a cover-up. It’s what the police do. They kill us and cover it up,' the boy's aunt Quwana Barcene told the Post.

'It’s not fair. It was my sister’s only child. You shouldn’t have to bury your child. My beautiful nephew got shot in the head. A mother of one now has to bury her only child.'

NYPD top brass are standing by the officer in the shooting - but are treading carefully.

'Regardless of the circumstances, this is a crushing blow to any parent,' Kelly said.

Ms Barcene likened the shooting to 
the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida - a case that sparked 
outrage across the country.

'Him,
Trayvon Martin, it’s never going to end.' she said. 'A child. Fourteen 
years old. Fourteen years old. Gone. Shot in the head. By police.'

Many
in the black community remain highly skeptical of the NYPD over the 
shooting death in march of 16-year-old Kimani Gray in Brooklyn. Police 
said the teen also had a gun, though the shooting drew marches across 
the borough in protest of the killing.

Sunday
was not Shaaliver's first run-in with police. In May, he was arrested 
and charged with attempted murder after he shot and wounded a 
15-year-old boy in the neighborhood. Police say they used surveillance 
video from that that incident to identify Shaaliver among a group of 
teens running from the scene.

However, those charges were later 
deferred and Shaaliver was released back onto the streets when the 
15-year-old victim couldn't testify against his shooter. Police believe that shooting was gang-related, as well.

The fatal shooting occurred in the Bronx at the volatile corner of Courtlandt Avenue & 151st Street

Police
said the altercation Sunday started when Shaaliver, who lives in a 
nearby housing project with his mother, opened fire on a man standing 
outside a bodega in the crime-ridden Melrose section of the Bronx.

The target fled, running down the street, with Shaaliver chasing after him.

Two
officers, age 26 and 27, who had jointed the NYPD in January and 
graduated from the academy last month, were in the area as part of an 
Operation Impact deployment of police in the neighborhood.

The
uniformed officers identified themselves as police and ordered 
Shaaliver to drop his weapon when they confronted him, authorities said.

Instead of dropping the weapon, police say, he raised it and pointed at the officers.

One
of the officers opened fire shot him in the left side of the jaw, 
police said. The teenager was pronounced dead at the scene.

'(The officers) literally were half a block away from where the (first) shots were being 
fired,' a police source told The New York Daily News. 'They ran 
to the corner and there it was.'

The man Shaaliver was firing at is still at large.
