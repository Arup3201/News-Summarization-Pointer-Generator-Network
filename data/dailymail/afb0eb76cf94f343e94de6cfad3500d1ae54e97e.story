The man, who was caught on camera charging at an enormous stingray on the Gold Coast, has baffled marine biologists and diving experts by declaring that the shadow was a fake.

Contacting the Gold Coast Bulletin via email, the man claimed that his daughter was flying a stingray shaped kite while he took a swim near Sea World in Queensland.

After noticing the realistic shadow, he said the duo shared a laugh and decided to send the footage to a few friends as part of a practical joke.

Stingray or the shadow of a kite? The man who was seen leaping at a stingray on the Gold Coast has claimed the figure was just a shadow from his daughters kite

The man was seen diving at the 'stingray' said the footage was part of a practical joke that they forwarded to friends

The footage showed him diving aggressively at the alleged kite, which swam away from his charges.

Soon afterwards, the figure appears to charge at the man who looks to be diving away in fright.

The next thing he knew, his mates had uploaded the footage onto Youtube where it went viral before being picked up by Nine News.

Clearly somewhat concerned about the amount of negative attention the video sparked from animal cruelty activists, the man decided to attempt to set the record straight.

He also provided the publication with the entire footage from the 'hoax' which shows him casually walking over the figure, which can be viewed on their website.

'No kites were harmed in the making of the video,' he told the Bulletin, opting to remain anonymous and refusing to be interviewed for a story.

As the 'stingray' accelerates toward the man, he dives away from the creature and seems to get away unharmed

He also stressed that he had a great respect for the 'majestic' sea creatures and would never intentionally harm them.

Despite the supposed hoax, Gavin Ball, 27, a Southport local who works at a café near where the animal encounter took place said that stingrays are common in the area.

'If you're out on the pier you see them every day,' he told MailOnline.

The most common stingrays are a smaller variety – 45 to 50 cm – but he says the larger estuary rays are still around, but that someone would have to be an 'idiot' to deliberately provoke them.

Stingrays are very common at Broadwater on the Gold Coast, and are generally not territorial or aggressive
