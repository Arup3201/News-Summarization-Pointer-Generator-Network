Two children have been left traumatised after their poodle's neck was torn open after being attacked 'like a rag doll' by another dog in front of them.

Frodo might have to be put down because the wounds to his throat are so severe his heartbroken family are struggling to pay the 
vet’s bills.

Dawn Stevens, from Dalton in Cumbria, said her children, Amber, 11 and Dylan, nine, were walking the pet about 6.30pm when the attack happened.

Mrs
 Stevens, 38, said because the four-year-old dog had his fur clipped that day, his 
collar was looser than normal and he slipped out of it. The attack, on May 30, happened not far from their home where Frodo continued after running off.

She
 said: 'He started running for home and on the way passed a woman with 
her greyhound and the dog, who was on a lead started attacking Frodo.

'It
 was really vicious and he was thrown around like a rag doll. A neighbor
 ran out to help and picked Frodo up and brought him in and the
 children were terrified.'

By then the woman and her greyhound had left the scene.

Mrs
 Stevens, who runs a balloon shop, said despite being on antibiotics the 
wound on Frodo’s neck is failing to drain meaning further expensive 
treatment.

She said: 'The 
next option would be to have drains put in his neck and for him to be 
put to sleep while they do it to get the infection out.

'The cost would 
run into thousands and we just can’t afford that.

'He
 is an amazing family dog and is brilliant with the children and they 
love him. They have been left devastated and really upset by what 
happened.

'Frodo just hasn’t been the same and the trauma has really affected him.

'He has hardly moved and he is struggling to eat. It’s really scary. If it had been a smaller dog it would have been killed by the attack.'

Police said they were aware of the incident.
