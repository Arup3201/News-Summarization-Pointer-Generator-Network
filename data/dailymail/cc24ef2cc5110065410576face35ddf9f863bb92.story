Roberto Martinez insisted Everton had to take collective responsibility for their Europa League embarrassment as he defended his team selection.

Everton endured a night of humiliation against Dynamo Kiev and tumbled out after a 5-2 defeat (6-4 on aggregate) in the Olympic Stadium. Their performance was stained by defensive mistakes, with Antolin Alcaraz particularly culpable. This was a night comparable to how Everton folded against Dinamo Bucharest (2005) and Benfica (2009) when they also conceded five times.

It made Martinez's decision not to start John Stones puzzling but the Everton manager maintained there was only a slight difference between the two teams and it was Kiev's superior finishing that meant they reached the quarter-finals. 

'We did make some defensive mistakes but also there was some incredible finishing and sometimes you have to highlight the quality of that,' said Martinez.

'It is only natural and normal from the outside to look back, and I do not regret playing Alcaraz - the defence has been strong in the last two games.

'We conceded only one goal from a corner in the first leg and kept a clean sheet against Newcastle on Sunday, although we did not adapt too well to the pitch. 

'But it is a case of the whole team not defending well enough. I do not think it is down to the personnel, but as a team. Dynamo built a lot of momentum with their crowd rather than us being to blame.'

Everton got back into the tie when Romelu Lukaku equalised Andrei Yarmolenko's opener but they fell asunder afterwards and Phil Jagielka's late header provided no solace. Martinez, though, was pleased that Everton kept searching for goal.

'I am looking at the effort and the way we gave up,' said Martinez. 'We tried everything to stay in the tie but the way it unfolded was down to one team taking most of their chances 

'Sometimes the margins are so small and part of the experience in this competition is learning how to play the second leg.

'Both teams created a lot of chances and the difference was one team taking them. After the away goal I thought we would be tighter but it looked like they had a lot of belief and always looked a threat and like they could score a goal. The type of game it was there were opportunities for both teams.'
