Good news for people who think they are Facebook fanatics. Unless you’re checking the social media site at least 14 times a day, you’re actually BELOW the national average.

The results from a survey may confirm suspicions about how much smartphones have become an integral part of our lives.

It seems that 79 per cent of smartphone users check for their devices within 15 minutes of waking up.

A majority - 62 per cent - don't even wait 15 minutes, and grab their phones immediately. (Among 18-24 year olds, the numbers rise to 89 per cent and 74 per cent.)

The research by IDC was sponsored by Facebook, which is the third most popular app on smartphones, after email and the browser.

Around 70 per cent of smartphone users are frequent Facebook visitors, with more than half of them checking it every day.

Peak Facebook time is during the evening, just before bed. On average, we visit the Facebook app or the site 13.8 times during the day, for two minutes and 22 seconds each time. The total daily average mobile time on the site via our smartphones is half an hour.

That's roughly a fifth of all the time we spend communicating; it's only slightly less time than we spend texting. On weekends, we check Facebook more than we text.

Almost half of Facebook users check on updates while out and about. The gym is one of the most popular places, with 48 per cent accessing the site. Some 46 per cent of us check it when we're shopping or running errands.

And a surprisingly high number of us checking while preparing a meal – nearly half of all respondents - at 47 per cent.

Movie etiquette has certainly changed since the advent of smartphones as 50 per cent of users say they have checked Facebook while at the movies.

It seems that many people are using the social media site for useful purposes – around half browse news feeds, while the rest of the time is divided fairly evenly between Facebook messaging and posting updates.

Half of Facebook users play games via the service on their phone a few times a day.

Pinterest has practically caught up with Twitter, according to Pew Research, with 15 per cent and 16 per cent of adult US Internet users on each network, respectively.

Pinterest, which launched in 2009, has experienced explosive growth, especially with a white, female and affluent user base.

Women are five times more likely to use Pinterest (5 per cent vs. 25 per cent) and almost twice as likely to be white and college-educated.

It’s become a magnet for hip urbanites searching for the hottest wedding gowns and apartment decor.

Twitter, however, gets a lot more attention, with Middle Eastern activists using it to publicise the latest political news, without state censorship.

In the United States 67 pe rcent of online adults say they use Facebook, 15 per cent of online adults say they use Pinterest, 13 per cent of online adults say they use Instagram, 6 percent of online adults say they use Tumblr, and 16 percent of online adults say they use.
