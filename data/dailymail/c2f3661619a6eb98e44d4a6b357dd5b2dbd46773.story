It's Christmas time - and that song is back.

The Band Aid one I mean, originally (and brilliantly) released to bring relief to the terrible Ethiopian famine of 1984. They've changed the lyrics this time, mainly to focus on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but also to spare a few blushes.

In the original, Geldof's stars sang of 'no snow in Africa… where no rain nor rivers flow'. That didn't quite key with the geography of the continent, still less so Ethiopia, where the Blue Nile originates, half the country gets more rain than London, and higher mountains are snow-capped all year round.

Green and pleasant land: The Simien Mountains present a different side to Ethiopia than many expect

Ironically perhaps, one enduring legacy of the Band Aid song is that, even 30 years on, Ethiopia feels like a distinctly odd place for a holiday. You think of it as a country in need of aid rather than visitors. I'm not sure I would have gone there myself if I hadn't been a supporter of the charity Camara, which takes in unwanted computers and gives them a second life in East Africa.

Camara has set up computer rooms in more than 200 Ethiopian schools.

Come and see how it works, said the charity's UK chairman John Brown, and then we'll go for a trek in the Simien mountains.

A few weeks later I was on a minibus being shuttled to Camara's HQ in Addis Ababa, a city of three million that feels like a small town. A visit to Camara in Addis is something I'd recommend to anyone going to Ethiopia, partly because the work it does is so good. Its HQ also happens to be next to the St George brewery, where waiters in bright blue jackets heft around trays of frothing Ethiopian lager. It is a fun place to start your travels. 

Hidden treasures: Ethiopia is home to the staggering rock-cut church of Bet Giyorgis, at Lalibela

If you're on a short trip, you'll want to move on pretty soon to the countryside.

At the crack of dawn on day two, we were on a plane to Gondar, one of Ethiopia's medieval capitals. The town is most famous for its compound of royal palaces, outside one of which stands a lion cage where Haile Selassie kept the last living emblems of his imperial rule.

But its modern life proved just as compelling. Ethiopia, as is swiftly evident, is a strange place. And the oddness begins with its staple food, injera. This is a kind of bread, disarmingly flannel-­like in texture, which is laid out as a tablecloth before mounds of hot curried beef and vegetables are piled on top. You tear off bits of injera to mop them up.

Even odder, though, was the nightlife.

We stumbled upon a strip of basement bars, and ventured into one rather jolly venue where locals danced in traditional fashion with rapid-fire jerks of their shoulders, before slithering to the floor.

Travelling by minibus from Gondar towards the Simien mountains is one of the great journeys in Africa. A few miles out of town you are in a countryside that seems utterly of another era, one where people still harvest and thresh by hand.

Into the heart of the matter: The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela are among the country's greatest wonders

And then you start climbing into the highlands, where mountain vistas open up for hundreds of miles across the rift valley. It is literally breathtaking as you climb to an altitude of about 11,500ft and the air visibly chills.

A trek in the Simiens is an Ethiopian highlight. Its core is a national park, sparsely populated except by troupes of sandwich-stealing monkeys.

We walked along the edge of a ridge, gasping in the thin air and at the endless ripple of peaks and valleys visible all the way to the Tigray - the area where the worst of the famine took place in the 1980s.

Above us wheeled vultures, kites and eagles, and in the morning, after a night spent in a sub-zero camp, we emerged to frosty meadows and a mountaintop white with hailstones.

A helping hand: Geaeteleawlmesai (right) has been a beneficiary of Camara's recycled computers programme

I thought it would be hard to beat the Simien experience but Lalibela, our next stop, did so. This isolated town, perched amid craggy mountains, is one of the more obscure wonders of the world. It was transformed in the 12th Century into a subterranean 'New Jerusalem' as its rulers set tens of thousands of builders to work, cutting chapels and churches into the rock. It sounds straightforward enough until you realise that they are cut vertically down into the stone, each one a perfect basilica.

You wander around this extraordinary complex to be greeted by monks and priests dressed in white robes and guarding their innermost sanctums, in which are housed replicas of the Ark of the Covenant.

It was at Lalibela, too, that I had my most memorable charity experience while visiting the local secondary school. We were greeted by a girl called Geaeteleawlmesai (par for the course in Ethiopian names).

'Welcome,' she said. 'My favourite subject is physics. One day I want to be prime minister of Ethiopia. We have very few books and not many teachers but now, thanks to Camara, we have computers. I want to thank you, but can you please send more?'

A final note: another of the oddities of Ethiopia is its calendar. The country follows the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar (Britain changed to the latter in 1752), so Christmas Day will this year be celebrated in Ethiopia on January 7, 2015.

Food for thought: Mark tried several Ethiopian delicacies, including wat and injera

And that's not the end of the matter.

The current year in Ethiopia, which began on our September 11, is 2007.

So if you fancy reliving Christmas 2007, there's still time to make plans… 

Mark Ellingham travelled with Wild Frontiers (www.wildfrontierstravel.com, 020 7736 3968), which offers small-group and personalised tours of Ethiopia.

Camara (www.camara.org, 020 8265 7681) welcomes visitors to its centres in East Africa and, by arrangement, to the schools it equips. If the company you work for has spare computers, Camara would love to send them to Geaeteleawlmesai.

Ethiopia: Bradt Travel Guide (Bradt, £17.99) is a terrific guidebook, worth its weight in birr (the local currency).
