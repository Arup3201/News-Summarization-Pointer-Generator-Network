The body of a 62-year-old missing woman has been found decapitated, dismembered and buried in a shallow grave at her co-workers house.

Kathy Goble disappeared two years and a day before her body was found in the garden of Charles Eugene March in Charleston, West Virginia.

Police said March, a 60-year-old grandfather, admitted to strangling his colleague and he has been arrested for her murder, WSAZ-TV reported.

Victim: The dismembered remains of Kathy Goble, 62, have been found buried in the garden of a co-worker two years and a day after she went missing

His son found the remains in a plastic bag while carrying out yard work and was not sure whether they were animal or human so called 911.

West Virginia State Police arrived on the scene and one trooper realised that March and Goble had both worked at Kelley's Men Shop.

"When our detectives picked him up, he was cooperative, came down to 
talk to us but initially was not cooperative as far as what happened," Sheriff Mike Rutherford told the Charleston Daily Mail.

'When our detectives indicated that we possibly had 
found the body, he indicated to us what had happened. He indicated that he strangled her and dismembered her body the next day.'

'Confession': Charles Eugene March, 60, told police he had strangled Goble and then dismembered her body

Sick: He killed her and wrapped her in a blanket in the bath tub before dismembering her the next day

The complaint says that after March strangled Goble, he wrapped
her body in a blanket and placed her in a bathtub. He 
dismembered her body the next day and then buried the body in his back 
yard.

Goble had worked at the clothes shop in Charleston for 10 years, while March had been an employee for 30. Police arrested him at the store.

Kathy was last seen on 24 April, 2010 and was filmed shopping on store surveillance cameras after leaving work. Her purchases were found at her boyfriend's home along with her phone and keys.

Her boyfriend Fred Ferrell was out of town when Goble went missing. Her family reported her missing two days later when she failed to turn up for work.

Her locked car, a 2004 Honda Pilot, was found abandoned two days after she was last seen, 
along Interstate 64 near the U.S. 35 interchange.

Questions: Police continue their investigation of the area beside the home of Charles Eugene March after remains were found there by his son

No motive for the crime has yet been 
given. Colleagues said they did not appear to have a different 
relationship to the rest of the workers.

'We're still in shock,' Kelley's owner Kenny Waldeck told the Charleston Daily Mail.

'It's just unbelievable that somebody
that's been with us for two years since she disappeared could just 
commit such a heinous crime and not show any kind of remorse, or change 
in demeanor or anything that would indicate that he was remotely 
involved.'

He added that 
they spoke about Goble every day at the shop and March, who is divorced,
never did anything to indicate where she could be.

Walker went on: 'He would sit in on conversations where we would all just be like, "What could have happened to her?"'

Workplace: Goble had worked at Kelley's Men's Shop in Charleston, West Virginia for a decade, while March had been an employee for 30 years

The shop owner added that March had called in sick on Tuesday, the second anniversary of Goble's death.

One neighbour, named only as Dana, added: 'We never would have thought he'd do anything like that.'

Still wearing his suit, March was 
charged with her murder and was arraigned in Kanawha County Magistrate 
Court on Wednesday afternoon.

The judge did not set any bond. March said he did not want an attorney as he had already confessed, according to police.
