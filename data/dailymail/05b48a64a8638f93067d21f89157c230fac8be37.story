This 217mph Lamborghini Aventador was going nowhere in a hurry after it was involved in a three-car smash on one of London's most expensive streets

The £300,000 top-end vehicle has been filmed being driven aggressively in the past with flames firing out of its uprated exhaust.

But it was turned into a depressing wreck yesterday afternoon after suffering serious frontal damage with bits of its bodywork strewn all over the road.

A parked BMW and a Mazda 5 - worth a fraction of the price of the supercar - were also involved in the accident on Sloane Street in Knightsbridge.

It is thought the Lamborghini was involved in a collision with the Mazda, with the supercar then hitting the stationary BMW.

Dozens of curious bystanders surrounded the Lamborghini to take pictures and film the badly-damaged matte black car.

The BMW involved is owned by art consultant Lila Afshar, who returned from a Mother’s Day lunch with her two daughters to see the crash wreckage.

She told the London Evening Standard: ‘We showed up about three hours after the incident and there was a letter on the windshield.

‘The Lamborghini was being towed away and the owner came up and explained what had happened. He was really apologetic about it.’

Recovery effort: The Metropolitan Police closed the road in Central London in both directions for almost an hour following the crash

Impressive model: The Lamborghini Aventador is powered by a 6.5-litre V12 engine which develops a staggering 700bhp

Crushed: It will normally accelerate from 0-62mph in just 2.9 seconds and go all the way to 217mph - more than three times the speed limit on motorways

Location: The crash happened outside the home of Lalit Kumar Modi, the founder of the Indian Premier League, who tweeted about the accident

Paul Wallace, from motoring enthusiasts’ website the Supercar Scene, said he saw the smashed-up car shortly after the accident.

‘I got a call to say someone had reported the Lamborghini crash on Sloane Street. This car is known in London but I had never seen it before.

'From YouTube videos he enjoys to drive it fast and rev the engine to create exhaust flames.

‘It's a very nice example of the Aventador so I wonder whether we'll see it on the road again.

‘The owner seemed young and was with a group of friends after the crash who all seemed relaxed bearing in mind the wreckage on the road.

‘I have never seen a Lamborghini in such a bad way, and couldn't really believe my eyes or ears when I heard about this crash.’

Upmarket area: Dozens of people stopped to take photographs of the wreckage, outside high-end shops on Sloane Street in Central London

Potentially hefty repair bill: The driver was breathalysed and his car was loaded onto the back of a lorry to be driven away
