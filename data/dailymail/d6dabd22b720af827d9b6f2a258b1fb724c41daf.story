Rejuvenated Chancellor George Osborne is secretly plotting to run for the Tory leadership when David Cameron steps down, senior Conservatives claimed last night.

And Mr Osborne’s allies are reportedly making plans to head off a challenge from the man he sees as his main rival, Boris Johnson.

The Mail on Sunday has been told that hostilities have broken out between the two camps, the so-called ‘Friends of George’ (FOGs) and the ‘Friends of Boris’ (FOBs).

Going head to head: George Osborne is secretly plotting to run for the Tory Leadership and Boris Johnson is seen as his biggest rival

Mr Osborne’s FOGs have accused Mr Johnson’s FOBs of making fresh attempts to find a Tory MP willing to give up his or her Parliamentary seat so that Mr Johnson could make an instant Commons comeback if the PM resigned.

And the FOBs have accused the FOGs of lining up Education Secretary Michael Gove as Mr Osborne’s ‘running mate’ and having him undermine Mr Johnson by claiming the London mayor is ‘not serious enough’ to run the country.

Sources close to the Chancellor say his ambitions have been revived by the economic recovery. And he may soon receive another boost with speculation that the influential Asian Voice newspaper will name him Politician Of The Year.

Though there is no indication that Mr 
Osborne would directly challenge Mr Cameron, friends say he is ready to 
stand as the ‘heir to Dave’ in either of two scenarios:

Silver-tongued Michael Gove is one of the few willing to take on Mr Johnson in verbal jousts

If Mr Cameron loses next year’s Election and is forced to resign as the Tories go into opposition.

Or, if Mr Cameron wins and, as many expect, stands down after holding a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU in 2017.

When Mr Osborne – at 42, five years younger than Mr Cameron – performed confidently in the Commons last week, the benches behind him were packed with a growing army of Conservative backbenchers keen to join the FOGs.

Silver-tongued Mr Gove is their uncrowned leader, seen as the ideal partner and one of the few willing to take on Mr Johnson in verbal jousts.

His being the adopted son of a Scots fishmonger makes him a foil both to baronet’s son Mr Osborne and to Mr Johnson, who, like Mr Cameron, was a member of Oxford University’s notorious and privileged Bullingdon Club.

Other members of the FOGs include Deputy Chief Whip Greg Hands, Business Minister Matthew Hancock and Tory MPs Harriett Baldwin and Nadhim Zahawi.

Another FOG said: ‘George will never betray Cameron, but if the economy goes on improving he is the ideal continuity candidate. Boris and Theresa May are the two who could stop him, and Boris is the big danger.

'We know Boris is looking for a seat.’

Mr Johnson is believed to have ruled out returning to the Commons before next year’s Election. He has discussed the possibility of Richmond MP Zac Goldsmith quitting his seat so he can take it over in a by-election.

But last night, another prominent FOB said: ‘Osborne effectively controls the Whips Office, which decides when a by-election takes place. His people will try to use that to stop Boris getting back into the House quickly so Osborne can stitch up the leadership.

‘But a Tory leadership contest without Boris will be worse than Hamlet without the prince.’
