A musician whose mother was diagnosed with a severe case of Alzheimer's has released a heartbreaking video of himself singing one of his own songs to her, in the hopes of helping her to remember. 

Joe Fraley, a songwriter who lives in Alhambra, California, commented alongside the video, which has now received more than one million views on YouTube, saying that it helps to raise awareness of the illness - and that it inspires people to cherish their own parents, while they can. 

'This is a video of me playing a song to my Mom who has Alzheimer's,' he explained. 'This was before she moved into assisted living, when she lived at home with me and my Dad.

'I am so confused': At the start of the video, Joe's mother can be seen getting quite upset, but as soon as he starts singing, she begins to smile and laugh

'I am a little embarrassed for posting something so personal. I wasn't expecting all the attention it's been getting, but the fact that it has touched so many people makes makes it worth while. 

'My Dad and three siblings are proud as well. Thank you everyone so much for such kind words. 

'I hope this video promotes awareness of this horrible disease... and encourages people to give their parents a big hug.'

Joe explained to Daily Mail Online that he finally decided to post the video, after much deliberation, when his mother's disease worsened - to the point where she was sadly no longer able to recognize him, or his music.

'I recorded the video cause I was working on a song of mine,' he said. 'I was trying it out faster than I normally play it and wanted my mom's reaction. 

'I posted it online when I recorded [it] a few months ago it but didn't share it until the other day because I was upset that my mom no longer seems to recognize me or respond to my music anymore.' 

In a post on Reddit, Joe added that he initially felt guilty about releasing the video to the public, because it showed his beloved mother 'at her worst' and he felt, to a certain extent, as though he was exploiting her illness.

'Part of me felt like it would be exploiting my Mom and letting strangers see her at her worst,' he wrote. 

Raising awareness: Although he admits to having reservations about posting the clip, Joe hopes that it will help to encourage more people to learn about the effects of Alzheimer's

Hug it out: The musician also encouraged his viewers to show their own parents as much love as possible

'I don't know myself': Joe's mother has advanced Alzheimer's and struggles to remember anything about herself or her family

'She was a college professor and after she was let go from her job she was very self-conscious of people thinking she was stupid. 

'But I'm glad I posted it. People have said such nice things and it promotes awareness of such a horrible disease.'

At the start of the video, Joe's mother appears to look quite distressed, asking her son where they are, where she lives and explaining that she doesn't know who she is. 

'I feel like I don't know myself,' she says. 

But as soon as her son starts playing, a smile spreads across her face, and - remarkably - she begins mouthing the words along with him, while dancing to the catchy melody. 

'You have a nice face and a pretty smile and you're a nice person,' she says at the end of the video, to which her son replies: 'Thank you mom, you too. I love you.'
