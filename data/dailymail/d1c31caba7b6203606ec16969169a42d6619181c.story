Many people blame large cafe chains for the death of individual coffee houses and making local neighborhoods more anonymous where people dash in for their caffeine kick without socialising.

However, three anthropologists have challenged this popular conception by claiming three Starbucks cafes in Boston, Massachusetts provide better community spirit than independent rivals.

A study from the West Virginia University found Starbucks provided a more welcoming environment based on its decor, amenities like Wi-Fi and friendly baristas.

Bigger is better? Three anthropologists have challenged the popular conception that chain coffee houses are anonymous and do not add value to a local community. They claim that three Starbucks cafes in Boston, Massachusetts, provided better community spirit than independent rivals

The anthropologists looked at six coffee houses in Boston - three of which were independent - to explore how effectively Starbucks can provide a community-focused environment associated with traditional coffee shops where the staff know everybody's name, The Boston Globe reported.

They conducted their observations in the six coffee houses in line with sociologist Ray Oldenburg's description of ideal urban, social spaces.

To do this, they took into account: the arrangement of seating, activities taking place in the space, amenities on offer like Wi-Fi and power points, the atmosphere (measured by decor, music and volume of people talking) and how welcoming the staff were.

The trio were shocked to discover that based on this criteria, Starbucks outperformed its independent rivals to provide the most welcoming atmosphere overall.

Researchers said the baristas in Starbucks were friendlier to new customers than those working in independent cafes (one of which is pictured) as well as providing better amenities such as free and unlimited internet access.

Among the finds were that the 'Central 
Square' branch of the coffee chain in the city centre had the most vibrant sense of 
community as the majority of the baristas knew their customers by name 
and could anticipate their orders.

The anthropologists also noted that Starbucks staff were more friendly to new customers than those working at the independent cafes they visited.

The study said: 'The Starbucks baristas would help customers by explaining the many 
options available and even offering suggestions. In contrast, the 
baristas at the independently-owned coffee houses were more aloof and 
would just wait or sometimes stare at a customer, offering minimal 
assistance.'

The third place is a term used in the concept of community building to refer to social surroundings separate from the two usual social environments of home and the workplace.

In his influential book The Great Good Place, Ray Oldenburg argues third places are important for civil society, democracy, civic engagement, and establishing feelings of a sense of place.

He said the 'first place' is the home, 'second place' is at work and third places are 'anchors' of community life that encourage social interaction.

Third spaces should be free or inexpensive, probably contain food or drink, are highly accessible and involve regular customers, he said.

They should also be welcoming, comfortable and should contain old friends as well as the potential to meet new ones.

While the chain scored points for its 
friendliness, it also outperformed the independent coffee houses 
visited by providing free Wi-Fi access, whereas two of the independent 
shops charged for internet access or set a cap on their customers 'daily
use.

The researchers said the study demonstrates the approach used by corporate coffee chains of being welcoming to everyone - even if it is in danger as being seen as bland - which contrasts with independent shops' approaches that tend to highlight their quirks to create distinctive identities.

Ray Oldenburg developed the concept of 'third places' as environments that offer a sense of community, but since coming up with the idea in 1989 the traditional coffee shop has changed.

'Due to the rise of portable electronic devices and telecommuting, an increasing
number of people now use coffee houses less for socialising and more as
a hub for reading, working, and productivity,' the study said.

It found that people use public coffee shops as a 'private zone' to work, and while corporate coffee houses are often criticised for their lack of character, they 'better meet customers' new third place needs by providing a wider variety of amenities and free services that are in high demand'.
