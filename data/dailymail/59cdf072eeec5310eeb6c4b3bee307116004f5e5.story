The real Wolf of Wall Street has admitted he lost his soul 'as much as a person can and still be walking around' in the midst of his wheeling and dealing and debauched life of 90's excess.

Jordan Belfort, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the Oscar-nominated film, described in a Monday night interview the moment he learned he was selling a scam, cheating innocent people out of millions of dollars of savings.

'It was about a month in when I realized. That was the first moment where I allowed greed to get the better of me,' he told Piers Morgan Live.

Soulless: The real Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, pictured Monday night, has admitted he lost his soul 'as much as a person can and still be walking around' in the midst of his wheeling and dealing and debauched life of 90's excess

Belfort, 51, who is now a motivational speaker, applauded the movie, and said he spent more than 100 hours with DiCaprio, helping him prepare for the role of his life.

He praised the actor for making the film what he calls a cautionary tale rather than glorifying the excessive behavior, as many critics have claimed the film does.

'Originally when Leo saw this project, he wanted to get it on screen – and he said this publicly – because it represented the mistakes that I made, and the attitude I had at the time, represents a lot of what went really wrong ultimately, many years later with Wall Street,' he told Piers.

'It was important to him, and I think
 that - what impressed Leo, I think about my new life so much, is he saw
 me make this really radical turn, and I think that moved him. And I was
 really proud and shocked that he did that.'

According to Belfort, he and his associates at the time didn't lose their souls all at once - the decline happened bit by bit.

'What happens when you get to this section of Wall Street is it's very easy to rationalize everything you do one action at a time and then it goes further and further,' he said.

The man who spent 22 months in prison for securities fraud and money laundering insisted to Piers that 95 per cent of what he did was legal but he added 'the 5 per cent was incredibly destructive and it poisoned everything.'

Those moments were hard to watch in Scorsese's three hour epic, he confessed.

'It was shocking ... I saw the movie with my fiancee the first time, and we were speechless afterwards,' he said.

'I
 had come to terms with my old life. I wrote this book, and that was 
like a cathartic experience for me. But to see it on film like that, 
with someone that did such a good job, I literally, I felt myself 
sweating at certain points, when some of the cocaine was being snorted. I
 got almost sympathetic reactions to it.'

Belfort
 then saw the movie again with his 18-year-old son and his ex-wife, who 
he is shown punching in the stomach in the movie - something he claims 
didn't happen in real life.

Certain larger-than-life things that did take place, however, include a scene where a woman shaves her head for $10,000, which she used to pay for breast implants, and another where stock brokers are throwing a dwarf at a dart board in the office. Belfort's pal really did eat a live goldfish and there was a 'sex-free zone' in the promiscuous workplace.

'It started with the elevator, someone christened the elevator early on,' he explained. 'There were all these young guys and girls, 18-23, and everyone's making a lot of money. These things do happen.'

The most outrageous thing he ever witnessed happened at his bachelor party, Belfort told Piers, but didn't elaborate.

'I can't say it on TV. It was an act 
of sexual depravity that made even me speechless,' he said. 'It happened
 in front of a crowd of 100 people, there were 50 prostitutes there and 
they said it was the most depraved thing they ever saw. It was 
absolutely disgusting.'

Belfort told Piers his lowest moment though was when his family fell apart.

'My marriage unwound and the thought of losing my children was the bottom,' he said.

Thankfully, his kids were young enough when he quit his addictions that they only know him as the man he is today, he said.

'I was an amazing father and I was proud of that. I got sober when my daughter was 3 and my son was 1,' he said. He added that his parents never judged him and always showed him unconditional support despite his criminal behavior.

When Piers noted that if Belfort had stayed legitimate, the hardworking salesman would have been worth a fortune today, he responded: 'That's the shame of it all. The biggest mistake I made was not delaying my gratification, I would have been worth $10-20 billion now.'

Belfort reportedly owed some $110 
million to the victims of his scam. But he said he's paid back around 
$12 million of his debt and is giving 100 per cent of cash made from the
 book sales and the movie to the compensation fund.

'I think it'll be many, many millions of dollars and I'm really happy about that,' he told Piers.

Caution: He praised DiCaprio, pictured in the movie, for making the film what he calls a cautionary tale rather than glorifying the excessive behavior, as many critics have claimed the film does

According to CNN, the film based upon his life has already grossed more than $91 million since opening a month ago.

During the hour-long interview, the host listed some of the people impacted by the behavior that landed Belfort in prison - Peter Springfield, an architect in Mystic, Connecticut, who lost half of his life savings, Dr. Alfred Vitt, a retired dentist, who lost $250,000 and Bob Shearin, who reportedly lost $130,000.

But Belfort said he hadn't met with any of his victims.

'I have not ... no one has sought me out,' he said.

'What I'm doing here, by turning over 100 percent of the profits, is probably the most genuine thing I can do. Honestly I feel terrible about what happened. You asked if I had shame: back then, yes. Now, no. I'm not going to live my life in shame. I think that's a toxic emotion.

'I live with remorse, and that means I go out and do things actively to make up for the wrongs that I committed in the past.'

But the former Wolf said he was open to meeting some of the people he swindled in a bid to make amends.
