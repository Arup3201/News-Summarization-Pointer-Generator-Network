Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson may have been at a more advanced stage of the deadly disease when she flew between Dallas and Cleveland than was previously thought, it today emerged.

The 29-year-old was diagnosed with the virus on Wednesday after helping to treat Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital before he died on October 8.

She had flown out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 alongside 132 other passengers on October 10 to plan her upcoming wedding. She had then returned on October 13.

Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has discovered that Miss Vinson may have had a worse case of Ebola during the two flights than was previously imagined.

Barry Biffle, president of Denver-based Frontier Airlines, emailed employees on Friday to inform them of the CDC's findings. He said the center had assured him crew members are at low risk of exposure.

Following Miss Vinson's diagnosis, the airline put the pilots and flight attendants on leave for 21 days, which is considered the longest it would take someone exposed to Ebola to become sick.

Mr Biffle added that passengers on both of the nurses' flights have been notified of the latest development. They have been told to monitor themselves for signs of Ebola for the next 21 days.

Symptoms include a high fever, vomiting, a headache, joint and muscle aches, a sore throat and general weakness. However, Mr Biffle stressed the risk to passengers was minimal.

On Wednesday evening, Miss Vinson, who reportedly exhibited no signs or symptoms of the illness while travelling on flight 1143, was transferred to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia.

The hospital has so far successfully treated two U.S. patients without the disease spreading further, CBS reported. Miss Vinson is currently described as in a 'stable' condition.

Sixteen people in Akron and Cleveland, Ohio, who had contact with Ms Vinson last weekend, have since put themselves in voluntary quarantine and are being monitored by health officials there.

Miss Vinson is the second nurse to have been struck down with Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan following the diagnosis of 26-year-old Nina Pham.

Yesterday, Miss Pham's condition was said to have worsened from 'good' to 'fair'. Doctors did not describe further details of her condition due to confidentiality but said she still had Ebola symptoms. 

In addition to notifying passengers of the latest findings regarding Miss Vinson's illness, Frontier Airlines has issued a notice to more than 800 people who flew on plane N220FR, an Airbus A320.

The plane made five flights loaded with passengers before the CDC notified Frontier that Miss Vinson, who had travelled on the aircraft, may have been contagious. 

The Airbus made flights to Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and back to Cleveland. It has since been removed from service, reported WKYC-TV.

The passengers on the other flight are not thought to be at risk for the disease, but Frontier is notifying them anyway. Those flights are:

After landing in Cleveland, unaware she had was infected with Ebola, Miss Vinson remained in her home for  three days, except for one trip to Attractions bridal store with  friends.

The store's owners have since voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk, according to Newsnet5. Meanwhile, officials are pressing Miss Vinson further on her movements.

Before her return flight on Monday, Miss Vinson noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane.

When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was under the 100.4 threshold. CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden has admitted that was the wrong call.

Miss Vinson was airlifted from Dallas, Texas, to Emory University Hospital  on Wednesday evening on a specialized plane with quarantine unit, along with medical staff in hazmat suits. 

The U.S.'s 'patient zero': Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, from Liberia, passed away from Ebola on October 8

Damage control: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is currently monitoring more than 75 health care workers who came into contact with Mr Duncan during his stay. On Wednesday, the hospital announced it would be offering free rooms to these staff members, who may not want to risk infecting their family members

Mr Duncan, 42, from Liberia, was the first Ebola victim in the U.S. He passed away on October 8. 

According to the latest figures, the Ebola death toll has now struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. 

Most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, all in West Africa.
