West Brom midfielder Liam O’Neil is joining Scunthorpe United on an initial one-month loan.

Scunthorpe have an injury to Isaiah Osbourne who tweaked his hamstring in the FA Cup tie at Forest Green and assistant manager Ned Kelly confirmed on Tuesday that he expected the midfielder to be out for 'quite a while'.

The 21-year-old O’Neil made three substitute appearances in the Premier League last year and has already started both of the Midlands club’s games in the Capital One so far this season.

He joins a Scunthorpe side struggling in the lower echelons of League One.

Mark Robins' side sit 21st, but will be hoping a 2-1 away win against play-off chasing Peterborough last time out can help kick-start their season.

O'Neil could make his debut for the Irons against Crawley on November 22.
