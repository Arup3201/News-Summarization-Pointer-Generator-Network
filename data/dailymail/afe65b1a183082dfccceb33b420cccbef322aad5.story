Scotland is in danger of sleepwalking into a split from Britain  unless the pro-UK campaign shows more ‘hunger’, a Cabinet minister has warned.

Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish Secretary, cautioned that the Yes campaign was gaining momentum and could win the 18 September referendum.

His warning came after a weekend when the No camp was thrown into self-inflicted turmoil on the key issue of whether an independent Scotland could keep the Pound.

More hunger: Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem Scottish Secretary, warned that pro-UK campaigners could lose because they are less passionate than the nationalists

Polls
 have also narrowed in recent days, with the nationalists whittling the 
pro-union Better Together campaign’s lead down to just five points.

Mr
 Carmichael, a Lib Dem, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics that the Yes 
campaign ‘have got an unprecedented war chest to pour into this 
campaign’.

He said: ‘We’ve got to realise what is coming and as a 
consequence we’ve got to get our arguments in place and our campaign as 
sharp as theirs.’

The 
Better Together campaign suffered a blow after an unnamed senior 
minister was quoted in the  Press as saying that an independent Scotland
 could be allowed to keep the Pound if it agreed not to remove the 
Trident nuclear deterrent from its base in Faslane.

There was speculation that the minister was Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary.

Much
 of the No campaign’s argument for why Scotland should stay in the UK 
has been built around it not being allowed to keep Sterling if it opts 
to go it alone.

Scottish 
First Minister Alex Salmond seized on the admission, saying: ‘All this 
bluff and bluster about not sharing Sterling is a campaign tactic, a 
negotiating position, something to scare the natives up in Scotland.’

He
 ruled out any deal that would let the UK keep nuclear weapons in 
Scotland in exchange for a currency union.

Mr Carmichael said that well-funded independence campaign could spend its way to victory, and had an advantage because its supporters are 'defined' by the issue.

More support: Mr Carmichael said more figures from the Labour party should rally around Better Together leader Alistair Darling (left), who are the official opposition to the nationalists, led by Alex Salmond (right)

Speaking to the Obserever. he said: 'We're never going to match them for the
 spend, but in terms of the hunger I think we have to match them for 
just how badly we want this.'

He said that though he was not 'expecting to lose', a victory for the nationalists was 'not impossible'.

'For
 nationalists this is the issue that defines them, whereas for a Labour 
supporter, a Liberal or a Conservative, this can be an issue you care 
about but is not one that defines you.

'So that is where we need to work harder at motivating our people in a way that their people come ready motivated.

'You
 have in Alistair Darling a first-rate campaign head, but I would want 
to hear and would expect to hear a wider range of Labour voices coming 
into the debate as it gets closer to polling day.'

A Government minister has allegedly said Scotland could keep the pound after all in exchange for housing the UK's nuclear arsenal.

The unnamed minister, quoted by the Guardian, said 'of course' there would be a deal struck over the pound if Scotland votes for independence, hinting that it could be used as a bargaining chip in a deal to continue housing nuclear submarines in the Firth of Clyde.

He said: 'There would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a Yes vote with many moving pieces. The UK wants to keep Trident nuclear weapons at Faslane and the Scottish Government wants a currency union - you can see the outlines of a deal.'

However, both the SNP and the Westminster Government has denied such a deal could take place.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said negotiations on the pound would not include the Trident nuclear deterrent, to which he said the SNP was 'unambiguously opposed'.

He said: 'Our opposition to nuclear weapons is not a campaign tactic or a negotiating position.

'Of course there will be negotiations around the currency zone but they won't concern nuclear weapons, they will be about debt levels.'

Chancellor George Osborne and Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander also denied that a deal over the pound was possible.

In a joint statement they said: 'The Scottish Government are proposing to divorce the rest of the UK but want to keep the joint bank account and credit card.

'The UK would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country and its banks. Parliament wouldn't pass it, and the people wouldn't accept it. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.'
