Greater Manchester Police are hunting this man is searching for this man in connection with the attack on the pregnant woman on January 17

Police are hunting a criminal who broke the leg of a pregnant woman during a 'terrifying' attempted robbery.

The attacker pounced on the 27-year-old victim as she left a newsagent in the Moston area of Manchester at 12.40pm on January 17. 

The man threw the victim to the ground, breaking her leg, while attempting to steal her handbag during the daylight assault. 

Detectives from Greater Manchester Police investigating the case have said it was 'pure luck' that the unborn baby was not harmed. 

The man shook the terrified woman violently as she lay on the ground and shouted in her face in a foreign language that she could not identify. 

The attacker unsuccessfully tried to steal the woman's car before fleeing the scene which is just over two miles north of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. 

The woman screamed, told the attacker that she was pregnant and even opened her handbag to show the man that she did not have any valuables, cash or a mobile phone in her bag.

The criminal dragged the woman on the ground by the strap of the handbag before fleeing empty-handed. 

The woman was taken to hospital where she was assessed by medics. Fortunately, the baby was not harmed although the woman was extremely shaken. 

She told officers: 'The whole incident seemed to last a long time but in reality would only have been about five minutes. He was very close to me when he was grabbing and shaking me and standing right in front of me.

'When it was happening I was very concerned about the safety of my unborn baby and for myself. It was quite terrifying when he was grabbing and shaking me. I didn't know what he was going to do or what he wanted as I couldn't understand him.

'I feel in shock and very anxious about it. It is going to change my behaviour and going about Moston when I'm by myself or with my children. It's even more worrying that it happened during daylight hours.'

The man pounced on his victim outside this shop in the Moston area of Manchester on January 17

The attack happened on Hodge Street in the Moston area of Greater Manchester at 12.40pm on January 17

The woman was interviewed by specialist officers from Greater Manchester Police who constructed an artist's impression of the man. 

He is described as a black male who is 5ft 10 tall, stocky and with a round face.

He was a distinctive scar on the left side of his face and was clean shaven. He was wearing a black zip-up hooded top with white strings and light blue jeans.  

Detective Constable Saj Sardar said: 'The victim impact statement this woman has written describes just how harrowing her ordeal was.

Her only thought was to protect her unborn baby and she was naturally terrified something would happen to injure her and her unborn child.

'Thankfully, though this is purely by luck, it does not appear the unborn baby has been harmed but that does not detract from just how frightened this young woman was.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
