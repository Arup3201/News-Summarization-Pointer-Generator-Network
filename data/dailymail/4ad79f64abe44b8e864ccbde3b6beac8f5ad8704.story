Ex-SNL star turned Christian crusader Victoria Jackson is running for a county commission seat in Tennessee and has opened up about her past and why she loves her adopted state in a revealing new interview.

'Nashville has two of my favorite things: Jesus and show business,' she said as she revealed that the Holy Bible she found sitting in her dentist's office has her thrilled she moved to the state.

Whether personally or as a commissioner, saving souls is on Jackson's to-do list, something she admits once drew the ire of her SNL cast mate Al Franken.

Crusader: SNL actress turned Christian crusading Tea Partier (pictured here protesting taxes in 2010 with a ukelele) is running for local office in Tennessee and recently gave a revealing interview as part of her campaign

The Tennessean sat with Jackson at her Thompson's Station home for an interview printed Tuesday.

And a look into her recent activities suggests another pet project could be ridding her new home of Muslims who might disagree.

'Civilization Jihad Hits Home (my back yard, literally),' the 54-year-old former actress wrote on her website after a Muslim man named Daoud Abudiab moved into her neighborhood.

After Abudiab, who is director of the Islamic Center of Columbia, shot back at the comedienne, she posted a list of terror attacks committed by Muslims in the name of their religion.

'He's afraid of me!?' she balked.

One of Jackson's pet projects is battling against plans to put a mosque in nearby Murfreesboro.

She's also pitted herself against a local school district after she believed it taught from a sex ed textbook called It's Perfectly Normal that she found too explicit.

The district has denied using the book in 'fourth grade classrooms' as Jackson had publicized on her blog.

Hell bound: Jackson revealed in an interview out this week that her former cast mate turned U.S. Senator Al Franken once quit speaking to her when she told him he and the rest of the SNL cast were going to hell

Though she's only brought her ditzy blonde brand of high-pitched moral outrage to Tennessee in recent years, she's a life-long devout Christian who even tried proselytizing to her SNL peers during her time there in the late 1980s and early 90s.

After current U.S. Senator and former late night funny man Al Franken told her the cast didn't buy her ditzy act, she shot back:

'I told him maybe I am overcompensating because everybody here is going to hell and Iâ€™m supposed to tell them about Jesus.'

She said he turned white and quit speaking to her.

She also recalled a female cast member who angrily returned a Bible on tape, one of the ones she'd decided to leave at the dressing room doors of each of her co-stars.

'I already have one,' the unnamed actress yelled.

Jackson promises she won't be a traditional candidate and will rely on 'word of mouth' rather than actively fundraising, and possibly buying campaign stickers and shirts with her own money.

Though once known for her parts in popular skits like 'Toonces the Driving Cat' and appearances on Weekend Update, in more recent years Jackson has been in the public eye as an outspoken Tea Party activist and conservative Christian.

In 2011 she sparked controversy when she blasted television show Glee for airing a same-sex kiss between two male actors, calling the program 'sickening' and 'a mockery of Christians.'

Fair? Though Franklin and Jackson were on SNL together for years, Jackson says the funny man turned politico stopped speaking to her because of her proselytizing

'I think the key to saving America is normal everyday citizens getting involved because we the people are supposed to be in control, not the government,' Jackson said. 'I had a political awakening in 2007. I'm tired of complaining. I want to do something.'

Jackson admits she didn't vote in any election until she was 37.

Jackson moved to Tennessee last year with husband Paul Wessel, a retired helicopter pilot with 35 years experience with the Miami Police Department.

Despite her newness to both Tennessee and the political sphere in general, the self-described Tea Party conservative believes things will go smoothly once she's won office.

'I think I will fit in quite easily with (the current county commission),' she said.
