Andrew Faulds, 40, from Greenford, west London, was jailed for 15 years after police found video footage of the horrific act, as well as hundreds of indecent images of children on his phone and laptop

A youth football coach and children's worker who filmed himself raping a 13-year-old girl with severe learning difficulties has been jailed for 15 years.

Andrew Faulds, from Greenford, west London, was sentenced at Harrow Crown Court after police investigators found video footage of the horrific act, as well as hundreds of indecent images of children, on his mobile phone and laptop.

The 40-year-old, who previously worked as a learning mentor for the Ealing tuition service in Southall, as a youth worker at Brentford FC Community Sports Trust and for Ealing Council's play service, pleaded guilty to a number of sex offences during today's court appearance.

He was caught after the video of a child being raped was seized during an arrest in Canada.

Detectives established that the video had been recorded on March 26, 2011, on a mobile phone on an estate in Southall, west London.

The case was handed over to the Metropolitan Police and officers identified the victim in the video as a girl with severe learning difficulties.

Further inquiries then led to the identification of Faulds, who was arrested on suspicion of rape at his home on March 7. 

Police were able to match the living room where the act occurred in the video to Faulds' previous address.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of oral rape two weeks later but further investigations revealed he owned hundreds of indecent images of children, including one that showed him masturbating in the same room as a young girl.

He was charged with further offences of possessing and distributing indecent images and sexual activity in the presence of a child under 13.

He admitted all of the offences in court today.  

Detectives now believe Faulds may have committed even more offences and are urging anyone with information to come forward.

Met Police detective constable Emma Macdonald said: 'Faulds has proven himself to be a predatory paedophile who took advantage in the most despicable way of a young girl with learning difficulties.

'He has an unnatural interest in children that he fuelled by accessing hundreds of indecent images and interacting with other paedophiles online.

'This case demonstrates the world-wide commitment to tackling child abuse and paedophilia and I am pleased this process has led to Faulds' conviction. He has been sentenced to a substantial jail term, thankfully putting him out of reach of other children.

'We believe these offences were not his first and would appeal for any other victims to approach us in confidence.'
