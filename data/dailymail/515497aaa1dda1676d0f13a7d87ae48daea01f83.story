The pub that helped inspire hit TV show Peaky Blinders could be sold for under £200,000 as it goes under the hammer next week.

The Garrison in Birmingham is where Hollywood star Cillian Murphy and his criminal gang gather in a private side room to plan their nefarious criminal schemes in the BBC show.

The watering hole - which could also have hosted the real Peaky Blinders gang - has been closed for two years.

The gang earned its chilling nickname through the practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their flat caps, so that they could blind rival gangsters by headbutting them.

Despite being put up for sale last year, the Victorian drinking den failed to sell and it is hoped the historic pub will be resurrected by a bidder at the auction.

For the guide price of £160,000 - £175,000 plus VAT a buyer could get their hands on the three-storey building near Birmingham City Football Club, which includes a six-bedroom living quarters.

The show’s creator Steven Knight said his grandfather used to drink at The Garrison and that he took Cillian Murphy on a day long research trip there before filming began so he could perfect his Brummie accent.

New lease of life? Despite being put up for sale last year, the Victorian drinking den in Birmingham failed to sell and it is hoped the historic pub will be resurrected by a bidder at the auction on Thursday 22

Although there is no direct evidence linking the gang to the pub,  stories of them frequenting the site have been handed down by Midlanders throughout the decades.

Speaking to the Birmingham Mail last year, Neil Hayes, security guard at the run-down site, said there were real concerns the building and its place in Birmingham’s history will be lost forever.

'Birmingham folk are such passionate people, but here they have a piece of their own history rotting into the earth,' he said.

'In its day, this was always the "go to" pub.'

The Garrison goes up for auction by Cottons at Villa Park on Thursday May 22 at 11am.

Harry Fowler, Ernest Bayles, Stephen McHickie and Thomas Gilbert, pictured, were members of the notorious 'Peaky Blinders' gang which terrorised Birmingham around the turn of the 20th century.

The gang earned its chilling nickname through the practice of sewing razor blades into the peaks of their flat caps, so that they could blind rival gangsters by headbutting them.

They ruled the industrialised areas of Bordesley and Small Heath from the 1880s through to the early 1900s, when the city was one of the world's most important manufacturing hubs.

To coincide with the release of the series, West Midlands Police dug up the original charge sheets for some of the gang members, which are now more than 100 years old.

The fading sheets show that, despite the reputation of the gang for terrible crimes, these men and boys had been hauled up on relatively trivial offences.

Fowler and Bayles, aged just 19 in the photographs, were charged with 'bike theft' after stealing the unattended item and attempting to sell it on.

Stephen McHickie, 25 when pictured, was charged with breaking into a drapers shop which was just 11 doors from his own home.

Thomas Gilbert, much older than the others at 38, was arrested for the crime of 'false pretences'.

All four gangsters are shown wearing the traditional Peak Blinders outfit, of donkey jackets, silk scarfs, bell-bottom trousers, steel-capped boots and a distinctive flat cap.

Court reports from the time refer to the gang members as 'foul mouthed young men who stalk the streets in drunken groups, insulting and mugging passers-by'.

West Midlands Police Museum worker David Cross, 69, explained the method behind the gangsters' signature weapon.

He said: 'It was quite a strange weapon they used to rob people, although makes sense when you think about it.

'When they would hit someone on the nose with their cap, it would bring tears to their victim's eyes and cause temporary blindness - that's when they'd thump you and rob you.

'It is a very quick manoeuvre - that is how they worked. They would target anybody who looked vulnerable, the gentleman on his way to work who didn't look strong or fit, ladies, teenage girls, anyone - they would take anything they could convert into money.'

But theft and muggings was by no means the only illegal activity of the Peaky Blinders, who built a criminal empire on illegal betting, protection rackets and Birmingham's black market.

The were known to fight with rival gangs, and at times would even turn on the police.
