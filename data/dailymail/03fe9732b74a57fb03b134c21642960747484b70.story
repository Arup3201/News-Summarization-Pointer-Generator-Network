Lucky catch: Armando Castillo, Joe Ludlow and Travis Savala post with the three opah fish they caught in a single day last week. Opah, also known as Moonfish, are a rare catch  and three at once is even more of a surprise since they don't often travel in packs

Opah, also known as Moonfish, are a rare catch for recreational fisherman since they don't travel in schools and therefore aren't commercially fished either.

Instead, most are caught accidentally by fisherman looking for other fish, such as tuna.

That's what the group was looking for last week when they came across the three opah in one day.

Opah also aren't known to stray often into southern California waters, preferring warmer waters in tropical and sub-tropical seas.

However, opah catches have been on the rise in the last few years according to a 2012 article by U-T San Diego.

'It’s the fish of a lifetime,' Snodgrass
 said. 'It’s like winning the lottery. Nobody is expecting one of these.
 They are just doing something different to try to get a bite and they 
hook an opah.'

National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration researcher Owyn Snodgrass said more opah are getting caught by federal marine research trawls in the area.

At the time of the article, Snodgrass had tags on four opah in the region, to observe their swimming and diving patterns. One of those ventured all the way back to more common waters in Hawaii.
