 'Fifty Shades of Grey', the titillating three-part series by E.L. James, now has a wine paring to go with it for readers who are thirsty for more.

E.L. James launched two romantically themed flavors : Red Satin and White Silk. The bottles each come with a little tagline that reads, 'You. Are. Mine.' Now they can be yours when you purchase them on her website.

According to the release, White Silk, a blend of Gewürztraminer and Sauvignon Blanc, has flavors like lychee, honey, tempered by flavors of crisp grapefruit, mineral and lush pear with a faint hint of butterscotch.

Red Satin is a blend of Petite Sirah and
Syrah that has been aged in a combination of new and seasoned French 
oak barrels. The tasting notes include black cherry, cocoa powder, 
caramel, vanilla, leather and clove spice.

According to E.L. James, 'Wine plays an important role in Fifty Shades of Grey, adding to the sensuality that pervades a number of scenes. I’ve always had a penchant for good wine, so combining two of my passions to blend Red Satin and White Silk was a natural extension of the series. I hope my readers curl-up with a glass as they enjoy the romance between Anastasia and Christian.'

Wine plays such an important part in the book, that E.L. James made a complete wine list and dinner menu that goes with different sections of the book.

The three sections of the wine list are cleverly named Fifty Shades of Grey for white wine, Fifty Shades Darker for red wine, and Fifty Shades Free for hard liquor and cocktails.

If you love the book, and you love the wine, you may want to see the film version coming out August 1, 2014. The film directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson stars Daktota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Charlie Hunnam as Christian Grey.

The film is not yet rated but may be NC-17 for the explicit sexual content that made the book so famous worldwide.
