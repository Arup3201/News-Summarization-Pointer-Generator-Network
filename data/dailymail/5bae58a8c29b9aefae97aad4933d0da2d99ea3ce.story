Read Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel on how Mark Clattenburg failed to follow his own lead on holding in the box

Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg will miss next weekend’s round of fixtures for breaking protocol so he could watch an Ed Sheeran concert.

Clattenburg travelled in his own car to officiate the West Bromwich vs Crystal Palace match in order to get back to Newcastle in time to see the award-winning singer-songwriter perform at the Metro Radio Arena last Saturday.

Premier League regulations require the referee and his assistants to travel together to and from games for integrity and security purposes.

Clattenburg also talked to Palace manager Neil Warnock while in his car, even though the Premier League code allows officials to speak to managers after a game only when all the assistants are present or with the permission of referees’ body Professional Game Match Officials Limited. 

The PGMOL do not want a situation between manager and referee which might escalate to being one version of a conversation against the other.

It is understood serial referee baiter Warnock had wanted to discuss with Clattenburg two incidents during the 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns, Wilfried Zaha being denied a penalty and a challenge by Craig Dawson on Julian Speroni that led to a goal and the injured keeper being substituted. 

After the game Warnock said: ‘It’s just like an assault. How come one of the four officials doesn’t see that? Dawson goes for about five yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face.

'I have not seen something like that since Bert Trautmann,' added Warnock, referring to how Manchester City's keeper famously suffered a broken neck in a challenge with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy in the 1956 FA Cup final. 

The Premier League called it ‘an internal matter’ that Clattenburg had not being given a match before expected Champions League duties next week.

Clattenburg has previously been cleared of allegedly making inappropriate comments to Jon Mikel Obi in 2012

Clattenburg has had a controversial career as an elite referee, including serving an eight-month suspension after an investigation into his personal life and business debts. 

Chelsea also made a formal complaint to the FA about his alleged use of inappropriate language towards John  Mikel Obi but the referee was cleared and the player disciplined.

Nine years ago, he infamously ruled out a Pedro Mendes effort from near the halfway line at Old Trafford, even though replays showed the ball clearly crossed the line. 

Clattenburg will take charge of Wednesday's Capital One Cup clash between Tottenham and Brighton and is due to officiate in the Champions League next week.

ADAM LALLANA ROW (January 2014)

Clattenburg was cleared by the FA after Southampton complained about comments he made to midfielder Adam Lallana - which were first revealed in Sportsmail.  

JOHN MIKEL OBI RACE ROW (October 2012)  

Clattenburg was accused of using 'inappropriate language' towards Chelsea midfielder John Mikel Obi during their 3-2 defeat by Manchester United. Clattenburg was eventually cleared after investigations from the FA and Metropolitan Police. Mikel was fined £60,000 and given a three-match ban for threatening Clattenburg after the match.

CRAIG BELLAMY ROW (Decemeber 2009)

Clattenburg sent Bellamy off for two yellow cards in a match between Manchester City and Bolton, having earlier asked the City bench: 'How do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?'

SACKED OVER BUSINESS DEALINGS (August 2008)

He was sacked by the PGMO board after allegations he owed £60,000 following a failed business deal. In February 2009, after an appeal, he was reinstated as a Select Group Referee but suspended for eight months from August 6 - the date of his original ban - for 'issues relating to his private business affairs'.

PEDRO MENDES 'GOAL' (January 2005)

Clattenburg and his assistants failed to award a Pedro Mendes goal for Tottenham at Old Trafford, despite the ball clearly going over the line before Manchester United keeper Roy Carroll fumbled it clear.
