Republican candidates appear poised to ride a wave of Obama-fatigued discontent to victory on Nov. 4. New poll numbers show voters preferring unnamed GOP candidates by seven percentage points over their Democratic opponents.

That lead, from a CBS News poll released Wednesday night, grows to eight points when undecided voters tell pollsters which way they're 'leaning.' 

Most stunning is the split on terrorism issues, with Republicans outpolling Democrats by 20 percentage points on the question of who handles it better.  

U.S. 'likely voters' also prefer Republicans by a 10 per cent margin on foreign affairs, seven points on the economy and 2 on immigration. 

SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE POLL NUMBERS 

FIRED UP: Cory Gardner, the Republican challenger in a Colorado US Senate race, has led Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in 6 of the last 7 published polls and holds an edge of nearly 4 percentage points on average

TOO MUCH BUBBA? Kentucky's Democratic Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan Grimes (left), has trailed Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in 27 of the last 32 published polls, despite help from Bill Clinton

HOLDING ON: Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (right) leads in most polls against former Sen. Scott Brown (left), but the GQ-model-looking Republican is gaining

The numbers are doubly sobering for Democrats in the light of history: In 1994, a year when Republicans picked up 54 House seats and took over for the first time since 1952, Democrats held on to a 5-point advantage in ABC News polling right up to Election Day.

The Republican tea party wave of 2010, a more recent point of comparison, came on the heels of a four-point GOP polling advantage.

The new CBS poll indicates an even more dramatic sweep could come Tuesday.

Other polls, from news organizations like CNN, The Washington Post, Fox News and the Associated Press, paint an overall picture that looks much the same. In the last seven published generic-ballot polls, Democratic congressional candidates haven't led by more than a single point. Republicans average three points ahead.

Election dynamics are about more than a broad national mood, however. Statewide contests can come down to local differences in campaign tactics and volunteer strength, and even in technology. 

Democratic strategist Dan Gerstein told Fox News this week that 'negative energy toward the president' will contribute significantly to the result, but 'intense hand-to-hand combat' will also make a difference.

'It could be that one side has a really kickass mobilization field director, which could have nothing to do with the fierce ideological struggle between the parties in Washington,' Gerstein said.

The GOP needs to gain just six seats in the U.S. Senate in order to control both chambers of Congress, effectively neutering the president during his final two years in the White House.

In the fall of 2013, Democrats held 10- to 12-point advantages in most so-called 'generic' ballot polls. But that lead has evaporated after a year of stunning setbacks for Obama and his party.

JANUARY RUNOFF? Democrat Michelle Nunn (right) and Republican David Perdue (left) will have to face a do-over three days AFTER the new Senate convenes, unless one of them can win 50 per cent of the vote on Nov. 4

Republican congressional candidates hold a sizable lead over Democrats, according to a range of polls averaged by Real Clear Politics; their positions were reversed a year ago

The flubbed rollout of the Obamacare website set the pace for a dismal year that included a Contempt of Congress finding against Attorney General Eric Holder – the first such vote in U.S. history – and renewed questions about the administration's handling of the 2012 Benghazi terror attack.

The rise of ISIS, the self-declared Islamist State of Iraq and al-Sham, has brought Americans a new round of Middle Eastern angst, as Obama steadfastly refuses to enter another desert war with ground troops. Republicans have harped on him for pulling U.S. forces out of Iraq at the end of 2011, which they claim left a power vacuum that gave the terror army room to grow.

The U.S. economy lies stagnant, with shrinking GDP-growth numbers announced Thursday at the White House. China's economic engine is now projected to overtake America's, and the proportion of U.S. working-age adults who have jobs – the so-called 'labor participation rate' – is just 62.7 per cent.

That's the lowest since 1978, when Jimmy Carter-era economics began pushing Americans to the point of embracing a Republican solution in the person of Ronald Reagan.

Ebola isn't helping matters. A variety of polls show the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's performance inspiring levels of confidence among Americans that rank somewhere between middling and nonexistent.

WILD CARD: Greg Orman, a political independent running against Kansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, says that if he wins he will caucus with whichever party wins the majority

RAZOR(BACK) THIN: Joni Ernst (right), the Republican former pig farmer running for Senate in Iowa, holds just a 2-point margin in her race against Democrat Bruce Braley

And fears about coming changes to America's immigration system – policy shifts that Obama has pledged to execute by fiat – are creating a sense of urgency among conservatives. They hold a sizable 'enthusiasm gap' over Democrats, with between 7 and 13 per cent more of them saying they are fired up about voting, according to a range of polls.

That puts Republicans in a position to not just win legislative seats on Tuesday, but to steamroll the field – growing their majority in the House of Representatives, winning gubernatorial fights and holding as many as 53 or 54 Senate seats when the dust settles.

The GOP holds 45 seats now, and at least three Democratic incumbents – in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia – seem headed for sure defeat.

Another seven races are considered in play and ripe for the picking, and Republican candidates have gained momentum in six of them during the past two weeks, polls show.

Democratic incumbents in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, New Hampshire and North Carolina look vulnerable to varying degrees. Offsetting those risks, however, Republicans could lose seats they hold in Kansas and Georgia.

If  a 50-50 split should result, Democrats would retain the majority since Vice President Joe Biden – as 'president' of the Senate – could cast tiebreaking votes.

Adding to the drama, Georgia and Louisiana both have runoff provisions in their laws, forcing a second election between the top two Senate candidates if no one wins 50 per cent of the vote on Nov. 4.

A Louisiana runoff between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy would come on December 6. A Georgia do-over, pitting Democrat Michelle Nunn against Republican David Perdue for a rare open seat, wouldn't happen until January 6.

That's three days after the next Senate is sworn in.

Republicans hope the drama has long subsided by then, making runoffs a matter of icing, not cake.
