David Price was delighted to be taken the distance for the first time in four years on Saturday night.

The British heavyweight won his third successive fight since losing twice to Tony Thompson last year.

Price comfortably outpointed Yaroslav Zavorotnyi over 10 rounds in Germany.

Hard hitting: Price was a comfortable winner on the night but was pleased to be taken all the way

Upper cut: The British boxer landed some heavy blows but was unable to knock out his Ukrainian opponent

Strong defence: Zavorotnyi proved a tough opponent for Price but he eventually triumphed

‘I was pleased with my performance,’ he said. ‘It was great to get ten rounds in the bank.

'I’ve been a pro for five years but this was the first time I’ve gone ten rounds, so it was a good learning experience for me.

Power hitting: this was the first time that Price had been taken the distance in his five year career

Victory: Price's win was his third in a row since losing to Tony Thompson twice last year

‘Zavorotnyi was an awkward opponent. He kept his hands up, chin down and made himself difficult to hit. I may not have got the knockout but I stayed focused and did what I had to do to get the win.’
