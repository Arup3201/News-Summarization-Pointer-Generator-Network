Spinal injury victims left paralysed have been offered new hope of walking again thanks to a breakthrough in stem cell science.

U.S. scientists have regrown spinal cord neurons from a patient’s own cells for the first time.

Implanting the cells in rats, they found that the neurons caused the animals’ nervous systems to rewire the spinal cord and brain.

Spinal injury victims left paralysed (illustrated with a stock image) have been offered new hope of one day walking again, after U.S. scientists re-grew spinal cord neurons from a patient's own cells for the first time

Scientists took skin cells from an 86-year old man.

They ‘wound the clock back’ so that the cells became stem cells again and were able to transform into any cell in the body.

These stem cells were turned into neurons.They were injected into the spinal cords of paralysed

rats.

In three months the neurons had made connections into the rats’ brains and along the length of their spinal cords.

The new nerves extended into their limbs too.

While this marks a scientific breakthrough, the rats were unable to walk again.

The cells used to grow the neurons were taken from a healthy 86-year old man. They were converted into stem cell and then neurons.

Researchers grafted the neurons into rats with spinal cord injuries that were two weeks old.

They quickly formed tens of thousands of connections into the animal’s brain and along the spinal cord, according to the study published in Neuron.

The connections extended out into the limbs of the injured rats’ limbs and bodies – ‘virtually the entire length of the animals’ central nervous system’.

Mark Tuszynski, professor of neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego said that three months later the cells grafted ‘across long distances in the rats' spinal cords, even extending to the brain’ by ‘traversing wound tissues to penetrate and connect’.

Lead scientist Dr Paul Lu of the university, said the human neurons ‘extended through the white matter of the injury sites, frequently penetrating adjacent grey matter to form synapses with rat neurons.’

‘These findings indicate that intrinsic neuronal mechanisms readily overcome the barriers created by a spinal cord injury to extend many axons [nerve fibres] over very long distances, and that these capabilities persist even in neurons reprogrammed from very aged human cells.’

While the animals did not walk again, the experts still said they had made a breakthrough.

And they believe that the build-up of scar tissue where the cells were implanted, could have prevented the rats from moving.

Professor Tuszynski said: ‘Me and the team are now attempting to identify the most promising neural stem cell type for repairing spinal cord injuries.

‘We are trying to do as much as we possibly can to identify the best way of translating neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury to patients.’

For years the experts have been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury does not have to result in permanent dysfunction and paralysis.

Scientists are so keen to use a patient’s own cells because they are more likely to be accepted by a person’s own body preventing them from having to stake strong immunosuppressant drugs for life.

For years the expert has been trying to find a way to prove that a spinal cord injury results in permanent dysfunction and paralysis. Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons (illustrated) are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off

Currently, there is no way to treat spinal injuries once connections between the neurons are lost, resulting in connections between the brain and the body being cut off.

Professor Tuszynski said : ‘Earlier work has shown that grafted stem cells reprogrammed to become neurons can, in fact, form new, functional circuits across an injury site, with the treated animals experiencing some restored ability to move affected limbs.’

However, he warned that further tests to find out how best to graft stem cells and cure paralysis could take ‘months to years’.

He also said that experts should be cautious when conducting a human trial in the future.

‘The enormous outgrowth of axons [verve fibres] to many regions of the spinal cord and even deeply into the brain raises questions of possible harmful side effects if axons are mistargeted.

‘We need to learn if the new connections formed by axons are stable over time, and if implanted human neural stem cells are maturing on a human time frame – months to years – or more rapidly.’
