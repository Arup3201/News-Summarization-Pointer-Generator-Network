One-eyed killer: Cregan, 29, today admitted the murders of father and son David and Mark Short

One-eyed police killer Dale Cregan today admitted murdering a father and son in a gun and grenade attack.

Cregan, 29, had 'bizarrely' pleaded not guilty to killing David and Mark Short despite apparently confessing to the attacks numerous times.

But today he changed his plea at Preston Crown Court a t the last minute after the prosecution had delivered their closing speech to the jury.

Cregan also admitted causing an explosion with a hand-grenade at an address in Droylsden but denies attempting to murder the householder.

He has previously admitted murdering Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, but had continued to deny killing the father and son, aged 46 and 23.

He lured the unarmed policewomen with a bogus 999 call before using a Glock handgun and a military grenade to murder them in Hattersley, Greater Manchester on September 18 last year.

Today his barrister, Simon Csoka QC, began the day by asking six of the seven remaining counts to be put to his client.

Cregan then stood up and calmly pleaded guilty to the murders of David and Mark Short.

In his closing speech, Mr Csoka said that Cregan now accepted he had killed four people.

'Members of the jury, your task is now so much more simple,' he said.

'You knew within a few days of this trial starting that Dale Cregan had killed those two policewomen.

'You now know for sure that he has murdered four people and that he has attempted to murder others inside the Cotton Tree pub.

'Ordinarily in a closing speech the defence barrister will tell you how important your task is, how it makes so much difference, how the liberty of the defendant hangs in the balance.

'All of those words mean nothing now, absolutely nothing.

'You may think after what has just happened, in a calm and almost clerical way...you may think "what does it matter now?", "what difference does it make?", "why does Dale Cregan care?".

Murder victims: Father and son David and Mark Short who Cregan today admitted killing

Murdered: Policewomen Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes who were lured to an address in Hattersley by Cregan and killed while unarmed

Victim: Nicola Hughes who was killed by Dale Cregan while responding to a 999 call

'He is going to be sentenced for four
murders and three attempted murders. He is not going anywhere. He is 
going to die in prison.'

Mr Csoka also told the jury that Cregan said he was not guilty of the remaining attempted murder charge.

He added: 'We are dealing with someone who when he sets out to kill, he kills.

'When he set out to kill Mark Short, he killed him.

'When he set out to kill David Short, he killed him.

'When he set out to kill the police officers, he did.

'There was never any danger of him failing to carry out those murderous objectives.

'It is completely different with Luke Road.

'As hard as it may seem, as absurd as it may seem, the only reasonable verdict on the evidence is that you cannot be sure he attempted to murder anyone at Luke Road. So therefore your verdict should be not guilty.'

Prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC had earlier said 
that Cregan used the same gun and the same type of grenade to murder
David Short as he had used in the killings of the police officers.

'Essentially it was the same way,' he
explained. 'The surprise ambush, the hail of gunfire and the gratuitous
throwing of his calling card (the grenade).'

CCTV
footage of him attempting to fire a Glock handgun and throwing a 
grenade at the home of another intended victim shortly after the killing
of Mr Short was 'the most obvious evidence against him', he said.

He
said it had been 'an odd murder trial' in that the main defendant - who
chose not to give evidence to the jury - had not challenged through his
barrister any of the evidence in which several witnesses said Cregan 
had told them he killed the Shorts.

Mr Clarke reminded the jury that he told a psychiatrist and psychologist in prison before the trial that he had killed David and Mark Short - and had even made the same confession to his mother.

Murder scene: Police outside the Cotton Tree Inn, Droylsden, Manchester, where Mark Short was shot dead by Dale Cregan

He 'talked openly' with some of his co-accused while in custody at Strangeways in Manchester about taking the life of David Short, he said.

'The fact that he has murdered David Short is the worst kept secret in Strangeways,' said Mr Clarke.

Cregan also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of John Collins, Ryan Pridding and Michael Belcher, who were all in the Cotton Tree on May 25 last year.

He also admitted causing an explosion at a property in Luke Road, Droylsden, on August 10, shortly after the murder of David Short.

The jury foreman was then invited by trial judge Mr Justice Holroyde to formally return guilty verdicts on those counts.

The judge then told the jurors that the defendant remained on trial for the single allegation remaining against him - that he attempted to murder Sharon Hark at her home in Luke Road.

The Cotton Tree shooting was said to have been ordered by Leon Atkinson, 35, from Ashton-under-Lyne, and that Cregan recruited Luke Livesey, 27, from Hattersley, Damian Gorman, 37, from Glossop, Ryan Hadfield, 28, from Droylsden, and Matthew James, 33, from Clayton, for the task.

They all deny the murder of Mark Short and the attempted murders of Mr Collins, Mr Pridding and Mr Belcher.

Anthony Wilkinson, 33, from Beswick, pleaded guilty during the trial to murdering David Short. He denies one count of the attempted murder of Sharon Hark in Droylsden on the same day and causing an explosion with a hand-grenade.

Francis Dixon, 37, from Stalybridge, and Jermaine Ward, 24, deny the above charges relating to David Short and Sharon Hark.

Mohammed Ali, 23, from Chadderton, denies assisting an offender.
