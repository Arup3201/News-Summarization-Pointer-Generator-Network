A £13,000 coffee maker, a £10,400 pinball machine and a £6,500 set of stones from Papua New Guinea are just three of the high-value items Christie's is putting up for sale in time for Christmas.  

But this year the London auction house will break with tradition and sell the 42 lots at a fixed price - offering shoppers the chance to bypass bidding and walk away with their big-ticket gifts immediately.

The new approach to buying, called 'Buy or Bid', is a first in Christie's 250-year history and will offer customers a service similar to the 'Buy It Now' option offered by online auction giant eBay.

Pricey playtime: This vintage 1962 pinball machine can be bought outright for £10,400 at Christie's, London

Most expensive: This coffee maker, left, will cost £13,000 and this large Moroccan Ammonite from the cretaceous period (right) is available to buy at Christie's for £2,080 from 14 November to 3 December

Unusual gift: This group of Papua New Guinea chloromelanite ceremonial stone adze blades or obligation stones can be bought outright, online or in their South Kensington showroom, for £6,500

Shoppers will be able to take a look at the selection of the out-of-the-ordinary gifts, both online and in their showroom in South Kensington, London, between 14 November and 3 December. 

And while each item, hand-picked by experts at the auction house, is priced at more than its auction estimate - shoppers willing to pay the premium will be able to buy without the competition and unpredictability of auction.

Any lots that are not bought outright in the three-week period will then go into the 'Interiors' auction on 9 December - where they will be on offer for their auction estimates.  

Nic McElhatton, Chairman of Christie's South Kensington, said: 'For the first time at Christie's, buyers can secure a handpicked item for a fixed price – they don't have to bid; they can walk in and walk out of Christie's with their purchase, or buy on our website.' 

New approach: With 'Buy or Bid' shoppers will be able to immediately walk away with this pair of fossilised giant deer or 'Irish elk' antlers
circa 10,500-5,700 B.C. for £10,400, rather than wait for auction

Fine jewellery: An 18th Century white gold and diamond ring, left, is on offer for £3,900 and this Bulgari quartz watch (left) can be bought for £5,200

Exotic earrings: This pair of Tamil Nadu gold earrings, from South India, 19th century, will cost £3,250

He added that 'Buy or Bid' should appeal to those new to auction and Christie's regulars. 

Among the more unusual items up for sale are a striking pair of fossilised giant deer or 'Irish elk' antlers, which date back to roughly 10,500 and 5,700 B.C.

Time for something special: A Swiss gilt-brass Atmos clock will be available to buy for £1,040

Foodies might be drawn to a pair of novelty silver salt shakers from the Victorian era which a Christie's specialist promises 'would be the perfect addition to anyone’s dinner table'. 

Formed as pillar post boxes, which were first introduced in Britain in 1855, they are enamelled with plaques listing collection times and the tops are pierced with flowers. 

The specialist added that the shakers, which are housed in a velvet-lined case, 'would make a universally entertaining gift.’

The most expensive lot up for sale is a £13,000 coffee machine which 'epitomises 1930s style and would look wonderful in a contemporary kitchen,' according to another Christie's specialist.

It is followed by a 1962 pinball machine - on sale for £10,400 - which offers 'unbeatable' entertainment.

Mr McElhatton said that his top pick is the taxidermy dog - a German spitz from the late Victorian era that is mounted in a glass case. 

The dog, which has a gold ribbon died around its neck, is on sale for £1,950. 

Mr McElhatton said: 'Recently taxidermy has been enjoying a renaissance in interior design and contemporary art and I think this piece is really cool – I’m even planning to have my own dog Alfie the black Labrador mounted on wheels with a push bar for my grandchildren when his time comes!’
