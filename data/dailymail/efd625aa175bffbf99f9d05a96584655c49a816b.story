The parents of Kayla Mueller, the American aid worker who was killed in ISIS captivity, are speaking out for the first time about her death.

Marsha and Carl Mueller sat down with Today's Savannah Guthrie to pay tribute to their 26-year-old daughter in an interview screening on Monday.

Kayla's brother, Eric Mueller, will also address their loss and his hopes that people will be provoked into researching and understanding the plight of Syrian refugees.

Speaking out: Carl and Marsha Mueller and their son Eric have spoken to Today's savannah Guthrie about losing Kayla, 26, the U.S. aid worker who was killed earlier this month while in captivity in Syria, held by ISIS

It comes after a candlelit vigil in the plaza of a central Arizona courthouse on Tuesday, when hundreds gathered to hear Eric Mueller offer a heart wrenching tribute to his sister, who died last month.

The 26-year-old aid worker's death was confirmed on February 10 by her family and U.S. officials following her capture by the jihadis in Syria in August 2013.

Before the crowd, her brother offered a poignant message to his sister when he told her: 'You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world.' 

Mr Mueller encouraged those in attendance to live as his best friend and sister had, by reaching out to others who were suffering.

Friends said 26-year-old Kayla Mueller (pictured left and right) was tireless in her efforts to improve others' lives and said she represented the best of humanity

In the first public comments he has made since her death, he said: 'Only now will you be able to see how much you truly did for this world by looking down on it. You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world,' USA Today reported.

He went on to implore the crowd to help those who are struggling - a belief his sister had dedicated her life to.

'If you see someone struggling, see somebody upset, go give them a hug. It will make the community stronger. That's all it's going to do.'

His father, Carl Mueller, stood up immediately after his son finished speaking and hugged him tightly at the bottom of the stage.

Friends, family and strangers wore pink ribbons on their shirts as they listened to speakers reflect on her life and work.

Strangers and friends dropped off cards and wrote messages for a scrapbook, calling her an angel and saying she represented the best of humanity.

Miss Mueller's friends set up tables to accept canned goods and money for the needy, saying that was what she would have wanted.

'She was a saint,' said Rebecca Dunn, who attended high school with her. 'I'm hoping someone can take on her legacy. There was nothing she couldn't do.'

Churches and community groups in her hometown of Prescott, the former territorial capital of Arizona, organized the candlelight memorial.

As it opened, a live band sang 'He Who Began A Good Work in You,' a song that Miss Mueller's mother, Marsha, used to sing to her as a child.

Her family sat in the front row, clasping hands and wiping tears from their eyes. In the crowd, people raised their hands, closed their eyes and sang along.

Pastor Ron Merrell said he was hopeful the community that gathered would give hope and love to Miss Mueller's family, and bring light into darkness - 'something that Kayla Mueller was good at.'

From Prescott, she helped raise awareness of HIV and AIDS, and she volunteered for the overnight shift at a women's shelter.

She protested genocide in Darfur while she attended Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. She also traveled to the Palestinian territories, Israel, India and France.

ISIS claimed she died in a Jordanian airstrike, but the Pentagon has rejected that, saying it doesn't know how she was killed.

Kathleen Day, a campus minister at the university, recalled the time when Miss Mueller taught anger-management skills to women in the county jail. She said Miss Mueller was learning and teaching about how to experience God in the midst of prison well before she was held captive for 18 months in Syria.
