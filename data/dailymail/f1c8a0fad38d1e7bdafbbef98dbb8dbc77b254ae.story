It has survived the strife of two world wars, including a bombing attack from a German Zeppelin, and the attention of rioting Luddites in the early 19th century.

Yet this grand horse chestnut tree is now facing perhaps the toughest test in its 200-year history - at the hands of property developers.

Taylor Wimpey wants to chop it down and build 74 homes on the site in Helmshore, Lancashire, where the 52-feet tall tree, has stood for two centuries, but residents are determined to save it.

As these old photographs show, the tree has been a constant feature of the village, not to mention a popular spot for youngsters to collect conkers in days gone by.

Residents were so incensed when they learned that the tree was to go that they have previously physically blocked workmen from cutting it down.

They have also contacted the local authority and set up a Facebook group calling for the tree to be saved.

More than 1,000 people have joined this online group and villagers are demanding that developers work with them to protect the important village landmark.

Ann Hodgkiss, 49, an administration officer said: 'This is the only horse chestnut tree there in that vicinity.

'People say it’s only a tree, but it’s been there for up to 200 years. It’s part of the village, you don’t just go chopping this trees down.

'When this is in bloom it’s fantastic, it’s absolutely gorgeous. It’s almost a piece of outstanding natural beauty.

'All the kids collect conkers there, somebody built a tree house there as a kid. It’s part of Helmshore Village.'

She continued: 'It’s been there for years. Staff would come out and have their lunch on the benches and the kids would go and sit by the river and have picnics.

'What can we do? We just feel that it doesn’t matter what we do it will happen regardless so we’ll just keep banging on and rattling on and hopefully one person will say yes we can save this.'

Developer Taylor Wimpey was originally refused planning permission by Rossendale Borough Council to chop down the tree after objections by locals.

But they successfully appealed to the Planning Inspectorate in March and were given the go ahead to build houses and apartments on the site with parking.

The land is currently being prepared by another company who have already begun felling trees.

But after realising that their beloved horse chestnut was one of the trees earmarked to be felled, locals spurred into action.

Garage workers spotted workmen about to chop down the tree last week and stepped in to prevent them, as it was subject to a Tree Preservation Order, although this has been superceded by the planning application.

Locals have since banded together to organise petitions and gather support on a social networking site to lobby the developers to reconsider.

Ann, who has lived in the area for 30 years, said: 'This development is horrific and it’s caused an outcry in Helmshore.

'Once they said that about the site we thought it’s progress, fair enough, we’ll move on, but when they said about the tree we were like hang on a minute.

'For years people have tried to stop the old buildings being knocked down and this is just the final straw now.

'The site is going ahead, we can’t stop it, the main thing is this poor tree now.

'It’s a fabulous one, it’s massive.

'I think the canopy spreads over 8m.

'They said it’s diseased but it’s never done any harm.

'They have said a branch fell off but it was struck by lightning and it took the environmental agency a long time to remove it from the river.

'They’ve said if it’s diseased they will cut it down and replace the tree with another in a different location which makes me feel that they don’t want it in that location.

'We think the least they could do is keep the tree where it is, and, if it’s diseased, treat it.

'To me, nobody has looked at whether they can treat this disease or not and whether we can try and save it.

'It’s just coming into full bloom now and if it’s that diseased why is it still living?

'We understand if it’s diseased and going to die, fair enough, but I think it’s not a good idea to chop it down.'

Battleground: Ann Hodgkiss and residents of Helmshore, Lancashire, are united in their opposition to the horse chestnut tree being felled

The tree survived the 'power-loom' riots of 1826 when hand loom workers angry at the introduction of new machinery in the village smashed up 108 looms in three days of rioting at a mill next to the tree.

The village then narrowly escaped disaster in September 1916 when a German military Zeppelin flew over on a bombing mission along the railway and bombs devastated the neighbouring villages.

Local Tory MP Jake Berry said: 'This historic tree should remain a part of the history of our village and should remain in situ.

'I will do all I can to ensure that the wishes of local residents are taken into account as part of this development and that we continue to enjoy this tree for many years to come.'

A spokesman for Taylor Wimpey said: 'An independent tree survey was carried out, and consequently some trees, which were diseased with numerous splits and open wounds were consequently found unsafe and have been felled.

'This particular tree was deemed unsafe, however, in light of public concerns Taylor Wimpey has suggested to the local authority that there is a further independent survey on this particular tree.

'Until the report is completed no decision will be made on whether the tree should be felled or not.

'Taylor Wimpey is keen to stress that they take public concerns very seriously, hence the further report on this tree.

'The local authority is happy with Taylor Wimpey’s approach on this matter.'

A council spokesman said: 'The tree survey identified that the mature horse chestnut was in very poor condition with evidence of decay deep inside the base of the tree on the eastern side, and other evidence of decay throughout major limbs in the lower canopy including splits in lower limbs and numerous open wounds.

'The council recognizes the passion and importance that local residents feel about the tree and we have contacted the developer to see if anything can be done.

'However, this decision in relation to the erection of the houses and the tree, was not made by Rossendale Borough Council.

'We understand the developer is talking to local residents about the future of the tree.'
