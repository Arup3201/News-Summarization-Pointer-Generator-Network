Thug rice, Wu-Tangy dressing and Blood money sausage.

These are only some of the items on a planned 'hip hop tribute' menu at a Washington DC restaurant that have left a bad taste in the mouths of prospective patrons.

Graffiato, an Italian-inspired restaurant run by celebrity chef Mike Isabella, is hosting a special $65-a-plate dinner February 2 dedicated to the West Coast/East Coast hip hop rivalry of the '90s.

Earlier this week, the popular eatery shared on its website the menu for the upcoming event honoring legendary rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls.

'In bad taste': This hip hop -themed menu created for an upcoming dinner at the Washington DC restaurant Graffiato has sparked a backlash on social media, prompting the owner to rethink the dishes

Themed dinner party: Graffiato is hosting a $65-a-plate dinner in February honoring the West Coast/East Coast hip hop rivalry of the 90s

The five-course prix fixe meal crafted by Mr Isabella and his team included such dishes as blood money sausage; Lil Kimchee; thug rice dyed black using cuddle fish ink; cali-cali cobb salad with 'Wu-tangy dressing ' and cheddar, and milk chocolate chip blunts for dessert, according to Washington City Paper.

As soon as the menu became public, it was universally derided on social media for being offensive, insensitive and downright racist, according to some critics. 

The ferocious backlash eventually prompted the DC restaurant situated in the capital’s Chinatown neighborhood to scrap the tribute menu and go back to the drawing board.

In a statement to the media, Mike Isabella's spokesperson stated that the menu for the hip hip-themed dinner was a 'work in progress.'

In an email to Daily Mail Friday, Mr Isabella explained in his own words that the idea to host a dinner paying homage to the legends of hip hop was inspired by his and his staff's musical tastes.

'I grew up listening to hip hop and many of my chefs and cooks love this kind of music too,' Mr Isabella wrote. 

The chef and restaurateur pointed out that to this day he enjoys listening to songs by Tupac and Biggie Smalls - two of his favorite artists. 

Addressing the negative response to his menu choices, Mr Isabella said that 'some of it has been taken out of context.'

One of the items on the now-scrapped menu for the event paid tribute to the Wu-Tang clan 

The listing for the event on Graffiato’s website reads: 'Join us on February 2 at 8pm, for our first food and art pairing dinner: a culinary tribute to Tupac, Biggie and the East Coast/West Coast hip hop rivalries of the ’90s.

‘The evening’s dishes are directly inspired by some of the biggest hits of these two godfathers of hip hop, and will be accompanied by a DJ playing those tracks, along with others from the era.

Opened in 2011, Graffiato specializes in seasonal pizzas and small plates inspired by Chef Isabella’s Italian-American heritage.

Isabella is the chef-owner of Graffiato DC, Graffiato Richmond, Kapnos and G in Washington. He appeared on Season Six of the popular TV cooking competition Top Chef and was the runner-up on Top Chef All-Stars.
