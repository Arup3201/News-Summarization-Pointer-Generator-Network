A gay executive has won a six-figure insurance payout after his boyfriend was cleared of torching his home in the throes of a childish 'hissy fit'.

Tony Howe admitted his tendency to what his lover, Jonathan Smyth, affectionately called 'Tony Bear Tantrums', and described one episode in which he had lain on the floor of a Marks & Spencer branch because he couldn’t get his own way about a bacon sandwich.

However, Judge John Randall QC today exonerated Mr Howe, ruling that the fire that gutted the couple’s then home in Brighton, was probably caused by a cigarette end carelessly discarded or dislodged by a housemate.

Cleared: Jonathan Smyth (left) has won a six-figure payout after his boyfriend Tony Howe, 41, (right) was cleared of deliberately setting his house
on fire in the throes of a childish 'hissy fit'

Mr Smyth returned home from work on 
the evening of Tuesday, January 22, 2008, to find his house alight and 
firefighters battling to put the blaze out. The fire, which started in a
basement bedroom, caused huge damage and killed three pet cats.

An
information security manager with Direct Line, Mr Smyth, in his 
forties, shared the four-storey house with 41-year-old Mr Howe and two 
others and made a claim for £200,000 against his policy with St Andrews 
Insurance Plc.

But the 
company refused to pay up, asserting that Mr Howe had 'set the fire' 
when ‘intoxicated' and having what Mr Smyth described in court as 'a 
Tony Bear tantrum'.

Today, 
Judge Randall ordered St Andrews to honour the policy after ruling that 
it was 'more likely than not' that the blaze was sparked by a 
smouldering cigarette, carelessly discarded or accidentally dislodged by
the couple’s house mate, Rebecca Alexander.

Damage: The fire started in a basement bedroom of Mr Smyth's former home in Brighton and made it uninhabitable. Three pet cats were also killed in the blaze

In
contrast to the fiercely house-proud Mr Howe, who did the cleaning 
whilst his boyfriend was at work, the judge said Miss Alexander, 35, was
a 'messy person' who smoked in her bedroom and annoyed him with her 
untidy habits.

Admitting she
didn’t tidy her room 'out of sheer laziness', Miss Alexander, from 
Birmingham, discarded flammable material - including used make-up 
removal tissues - around her bedroom and the state of her room was 'a 
serious fire hazard', the judge said.

Mr
Howe had given his evidence calmly and consistently, whereas Miss 
Alexander was 'to put it at its kindest an overly defensive witness' who
had given 'at least slanted information' to the police after the fire, 
leading to Mr Howe’s arrest.

The
judge said the most plausible explanation was that the 'naturally 
careless' children’s home care worker had discarded or dislodged a 
burning cigarette whilst in a tired, anxious and agitated mood following
a 'shouting match' with Mr Howe.

Cause: Judge Randall ruled that the blaze was 'more likely than not' sparked by a smouldering cigarette, carelessly discarded or accidentally dislodged by the couple's house mate, Rebecca Alexander

Housemate: The judge said Rebecca Alexander, 35, was a 'messy person' who smoked in her bedroom and annoyed Mr Howe with her untidy habits

The
court earlier heard the housemates had a 'history' of rows 'about 
tidiness' in the house. Mr Smyth, now of Stirling, Scotland, had 
received a text from Miss Alexander while on his way home from work, 
saying that Mr Howe had gone into a 'big fat Tony Tantrum' and that the 
pair had fallen out.

The 
fire was discovered and the house evacuated whilst Miss Alexander, at 
the foot of whose bed the heart of the blaze was found, was out. She 
subsequently made 'accusations of arson' against Mr Howe. He was 
arrested, but later released without charge after a police officer 
described his account as 'very credible'.

Mr
Smyth, in the witness box, admitted his boyfriend was 'rather prone to 
having hissy fits' but denied that he would have done anything to damage
the house or harm any of its occupants

'Tony
had tantrums yes, hissy fits,' he said. 'I called them Tony Bear 
tantrums - it was like watching a five-year-old stamping and shouting,' 
he added.

'The tantrums 
varied. Sometimes it was just a moan, a complaint. On much rarer 
occasions it was a full stomp the feet and shout. Generally it was a 
hissy fit, not a full-on shouting match, a complaint, a bit of attention
seeking,' he went on.

'What I call a Tony Bear tantrum covered a wide spectrum from the full blown row to a little "look at me" attention seeking.'

Defending
his boyfriend from the accusation that he would have set the house on 
fire in a 'rage', Mr Smyth said: 'Tony is soft - he wouldn’t lift a 
finger - it’s not in his nature.'

Mr
Howe admitted that the descriptions of 'Tony Tantrums' were accurate. 
'I do have other types of Tony Tantrum. I have lain on the floor in 
Marks & Spencer completely sober and made everybody laugh because I 
couldn’t get my own way about a bacon sandwich,' he said.

Mr
Howe admitted that he had been drinking in pubs on the night of the 
blaze to celebrate his birthday and was 'merry' before returning home 
and rowing with Miss Alexander about the state of the kitchen.

He
said that he yelled swearwords at Miss Alexander as she left the house 
and that the row had been 'on the bad end of the Tony Bear tantrum 
spectrum.'

Judge Randall’s 
ruling that Mr Howe did not set the property on fire means 
St Andrew’s must honour Mr Smyth’s insurance policy and pay out for the 
damage caused by the accidental blaze.
