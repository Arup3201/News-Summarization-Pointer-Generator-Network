Pushing home a shopping trolley overflowing with nuts, this squirrel looks as though he is storing up for a long winter.

The inquisitive rodent is then spotted sipping a can of Red Bull through a straw, playing a slot machine and stopping to play football in what appeared to be a busy day.

Photographer Guido Wacker from Gossau, Switzerland, encouraged a group of wild squirrels to explore some props by covering them in nuts.

Pushing home a shopping trolley overflowing with nuts, this squirrel looks as though he is storing up for a long winter

The inquisitive rodent is then spotted sipping a can of Red Bull through a straw for an energy boost

After they used the nut-covered object three times he removed the snack and waited for them to approach, so he could take the perfect shot.

He even captured them operating power tools and a Nikon long-lens camera.

'Squirrels fascinate me as they are very curious.,' he said.

'It all started with boredom - I was with a friend and we started playing with a squirrel and a can of Red Bull.

'To make these funny images I put a lot of nuts on the object then once the squirrel has been on it three times, I take the nuts off.

'People's reactions to the photographs are always very positive - all the photos look very funny.'
