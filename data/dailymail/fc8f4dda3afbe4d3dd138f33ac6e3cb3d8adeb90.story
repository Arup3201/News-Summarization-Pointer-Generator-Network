The Kardashian family tend to make headlines on a regular basis as Kim's relationship with Kanye West and Kendall's modelling career are never too far from the news agenda.

Until now, they have not had much relevance to the sporting world but that has all changed as Lewis and Clark Middle School have decided to name one of their trick plays after the Kardashians.

The Missouri-based Middle School used a trick shot called 'The Ugly Kardashian' to trick their opposition's defense in a recent game against Thomas Jefferson Middle School.

'The Ugly Kardashian' sees Lewis and Clark's attack pretend to stop and point to the far corner of the field before running straight through their opponents defense to score a touchdown.

Lewis and Clark's head coach Shawn Griggs, who appears to shout 'execute' in order for his players to carry out the trick shot, told Max Preps: 'When I said it the first time in the huddle they wouldn’t stop laughing.

'I threatened to change the name of it because they would laugh every time I said it.

'Football is supposed to be fun. So the name stayed.'
