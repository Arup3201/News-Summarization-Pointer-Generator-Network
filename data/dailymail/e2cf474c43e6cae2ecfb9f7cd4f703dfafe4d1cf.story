A Colorado man has been sentenced  to 80 years in prison for kidnapping and murdering a Montana teacher just moments after she had left her home in 2012.

Lester Van Waters Jr., 50, was found guilty of killing Sherry Arnold, 43, in Sidney, Montana, and burying her body 50 miles away in North Dakota while high on crack cocaine. 

His accomplice Michael Keith Spell, 24, pleaded guilty to deliberate homicide in October. 

Lester Van Waters Jr. 50, one of two suspects charged with the aggravated kidnapping of 43-year-old teacher Sherry Arnold from Sidney, Montana, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison

Waters will not be eligible for parole for at least 20 years under the terms of the sentence after pleading guilty last year to deliberate homicide by accountability.

Authorities said Waters and Spell killed the Sidney High School math teacher during an attempted abduction just blocks from her house on January 7, 2012.

The court heard that Arnold struggled as she was dragged to a vehicle and ultimately lost consciousness. 

Her body was found more than two months later buried in a rural area of North Dakota.

Spell and Waters had traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and previous testimony from the men.

They had told friends and family they were searching for work in the Bakken oil fields along the Montana-North Dakota border, where an oil boom has boosted agricultural communities but brought a spike in crime.

The 43-year-old was out jogging just blocks away from her home when Waters and his accomplice Michael Keith Spell tried to abduct her while high on crack cocaine 

During their journey from Colorado, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack 'brought the devil out in him' and began talking about kidnapping and killing a female, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors.

Authorities said Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated after Spell tried to grab her. Spell said during a change-of-plea hearing in October that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold.

Waters made a deal with prosecutors that called for him to testify against Spell if the case went to trial. 

In exchange, Waters was spared the death penalty and prosecutors recommended he receive 100 years prison with 20 years suspended.

His accomplice Michael Keith Spell, 24, pleaded guilty to deliberate homicide in October. He told the court Arnold struggled as they tried to drag her to a car and she ultimately lost consciousness 

Prosecutors called two people to testify during Monday's hearing: FBI agent Craig Overby and state probation officer Wally Peter. Private investigator Richard Wood testified on behalf of the defense.

Waters had a lengthy criminal background in Florida, where he lived until after his most recent release from prison in August 2010.

Beginning in the late 1980s, he had several stints in jail in Florida's Indian River County and served three state prison sentences between 2002 and 2010.

Spell has pleaded guilty to deliberate homicide. His sentencing has not been scheduled.
