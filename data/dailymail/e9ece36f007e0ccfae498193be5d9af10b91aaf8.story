A Muslim man from Melbourne who fled to the Middle East to join the fight with Islamic State has threatened a terrorist attack in Australia and to 'bring the war home' to the west.

It comes after chilling photographs emerged on social media of Suhan Rahman who was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar.

Elomar grabbed global headlines and gained notoriety after he tweeted pictures of himself smiling as he held up decapitated heads of Syrian soldiers in Syria and threatened the country with a terrorist attack.

Rahman's family has made a desperate plea after the 23-year-old's father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities in a bid to bring their son back home, The Daily Telegraph reports.

Mr Rahman has been told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they are monitoring his son's every movement overseas.

His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to join the death cult in Syria.

'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph.

'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.'

His previous posts painted a keen young reveller at Melbourne nightclubs who enjoyed partying with his mates, rap music and fast cars but in recent months, he has taken an eerie turn.
