A terminally ill young mother has made a ‘bucket list’ of activities she wants to do she dies.

Ailsa Malcolm-Hutton, 30, has been told she has between two and five years to live, after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease earlier this month.

The progressive, incurable disease attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord.

Ailsa Malcolm-Hutton, 30, was diagnosed with MND earlier this month. She has drawn up a 'bucket list' of things she wants to do with her daughter, Isabella, six, before she dies

MND is a terminal illness that  kills the motor neurones - the nerve cells that send messages to the muscles so the body can move.

There are 5,000 people living with motor neurone disease in the UK at any one time, but it’s unusual for it to strike in under-40s; most people diagnosed are between 50 and 70.

The patient eventually becomes entirely paralysed - unable to move, talk, swallow or breathe, but still able to see, hear and feel.

In most cases there is no obvious cause - around ten per cent of cases are genetic.

Life expectancy is usually six months to five years and the only licensed treatment is the drug riluzole, which can slow the progression of the disease, but only for up to six months.

More than £300 million is spent annually on cancer research in the UK, the average annual spending on MND research is £2 million.

It slowly affects the ability of the sufferer to walk, talk, eat, drink and breathe.

The former barmaid lives with her six-year-old daughter, Isabella, and her mother, Annette, in Manchester, and said she is determined to make every day count.

Her ‘bucket list’ includes a trip to Disney World in Florida with her daughter, playing a hand of poker in Las Vegas, and taking a helicopter trip across the Grand Canyon.

Ms Malcolm-Hutton said: ‘I’m being strong, I haven’t really broken down yet mainly because people are doing such wonderful things for me - it’s keeping me going.

‘I’m still in my party years - it’s really rare for a 30-year-old woman to have this disease - but I’m determined that I’m not going to stop going out or become a recluse.

‘Isabella is only six, and can’t grasp the severity of it. When I told her I might need a wheelchair, she was very upset at first but then said she’d get me a red wheelchair, because I love Manchester United. 

‘If I’m strong for her now, hopefully 
she’ll remember me as a strong person. I want to be an inspiration to 
her, and for us to do fun things together - that’s why I’ve made the 
bucket list.’

Ms Malcolm-Hutton (pictured with her daughter, Isabella, and her mother, Annette) was diagnosed after she noticed that she was struggling to grip objects as she picked them up

Ms Malcolm-Hutton's 'bucket list' includes taking her daughter to Disney World, going on a girly holiday to Croatia, appearing on television, and playing poker in Las Vegas

(Not all to be done with Isabella!)

A trip to Disney World, Florida

To visit Miami, Jamaica, Canada and the Scottish Highlands

To be the only woman on a lads holiday to Ibiza

To go on a girly trip to Croatia

To play poker in Las Vegas

To take a helicopter ride around the Grand Canyon

To appear on TV

To marry Robin Van Persie (but I’d settle for a kiss!)

Ms Malcolm-Hutton first noticed symptoms
of the condition in May 2012 – she found that she was struggling to 
grip glasses and lift objects.

She went to her GP, who immediately referred her to neurological specialists at Salford Royal Hospital.

She said: ‘The night before I was really nervous - I’d done some research and thought it might be MND, so I was fretting about that. Otherwise, I thought it would probably be only something little.

‘When they told me it was motor neurone disease, my face just dropped. I read about the disease and the life expectancy.

‘I can’t remember anything about the day after that, apart from pleading with the doctor to check if really it was MND.’
