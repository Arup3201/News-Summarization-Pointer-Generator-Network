'I have had my last Guinness and Sam Adams. Heineken was always slop': Catholic League president Bill Donohue (pictured) called for a boycott of the companies that supported LGBT groups by pulling out of Monday's St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York

The president of the Catholic League has called for a boycott of the beer companies that pulled out of Monday's St. Patrick's Day Parade and blames LGBT 'bullies.'

Bill Donohue posted to his organization's website Tuesday and called for all his followers to immediately stop drinking Heineken, Sam Adams and Guinness.

Though some will be more difficult than others.

'I have had my last Guinness and Sam Adams. Heineken was always slop, so there is no sacrifice there,' writes Donohue. 'I urge Catholics, and all those who believe in tolerance, diversity, and the First Amendment, to join with me in boycotting these brews.'

Donohue says the companies are 'discriminating' Irish Catholics everywhere by declining to sponsor the parade, which has for decades refused to allow gay groups to march under banners that designate them as such.

'None of these companies believe in diversity. No gay person has ever been barred from marching in any St. Patrickâ€™s Day parade, anymore than the parade bans pro-life Catholics or vegetarian Catholics,' he wrote.

The hard-line religious leader even tried to characterize the issue as a constitutional one.

'The bullies also have nothing but contempt for the constitutional rights of Irish Catholics,' he writes. 'I urge Catholics, and all those who believe in tolerance, diversity, and the First Amendment, to join with me in boycotting these brews.'

Guinness dropped out of the New York 
City St Patrick's Day parade to support gay rights, just a day before 
the 250-year-old event was set to take place.

Constitutional? The hard-line group's leader characterized the corporate move as a violation of over 'the constitutional rights of Irish Catholics'

Came as a shock? Guinness announced it would be pulling its sponsorship of the 250-year-old parade just a day before it was held

The Irish beer company decided to pull sponsorship from the parade after the owners of legendary New York gay bar The Stonewall Inn threatened to stop serving the draught.

A Guinness spokesperson said the company was hoping the organizers would reverse their exclusionary policy in time for the Monday parade, but since the rules weren't changed the company decided to withdraw participation.

'Guinness has a strong history of 
supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all...We 
will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future 
parades have an inclusionary policy' the statement read.

Following the statement, The Stonewall Inn said it would continue to serve Guinness.

Guinness
 was the third beer company to drop sponsorship of an American St 
Patrick's Day Parade this year in support of gay rights.

About one million spectators streamed into New York on Monday for its St. Patrick's Day Parade, which was even boycotted by Mayor Bill de Blasio

Days before, both Sam Adams and Heineken pulled out of the parade citing the exclusionary policies and Mayor Bill DeBlasio broke with decades of tradition when he announced he'd support the LGBT community by enjoying the Irish celebration elsewhere.

Currently Ford is the last major American company to continue its sponsorship of the parade.

In a statement issued to CNBC last week, the motor company said it sponsors a 'wide range of events' across teh country and that no one event 'reflects Ford's views on every issue.'

New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade is one of the U.S.'s oldest Irish traditions. It marched for the first time more than 250 years ago, on March 17, 1762 - 14 years before the Declaration of Independence.
