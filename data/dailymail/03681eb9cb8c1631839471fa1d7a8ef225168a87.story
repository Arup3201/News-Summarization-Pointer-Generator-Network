'Still in charge': Documents declassified for a terror trial seem to show Osama bin Laden was a key Al-Qaeda decision-maker - even in hiding

Osama bin Laden was in still in charge of al-Qaeda and making crucial decisions for the terror network right up until the US assassinated him, according to court documents.

Bin Laden, who was killed by a Navy SEALs raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, was being asked to approve operational decisions until his death, files taken from his compound say.

The revelations came when the files were made public as part of a terror trial in Brooklyn, New York, where Abid Naseer, 28, is accused of plotting to launch an attack on the New York subway system.

Included among the pages of documents, acquired and published by the New York Post, is an exchange in which an al-Qaeda commander asks permission to relocate a terrorist cell to Iran.

Bin Laden's correspondent wrote: 'Sheikh Yunis is ready to move and travel. The destination, in principle, is Iran, and he has with him six to eight brothers that he chose.

'I told him we are waiting for final complete confirmation from you to move, and agree on this destination.

'His plan is: stay around three months in Iran to train the brothers there then start moving them and distributing them in the world for their missions and specialties. He explained those to you in his report and plan.'

The Post said that the purpose of the Iranian move was to plan terror attacks on Europe. 

Different documents also ask for advice on how best to wage their 'jihad war' against the Pakistani government.

Raid: The papers addressed to bin Laden were recovered by U.S. authorities from the compound

Elsewhere in the cache of documents, an Al-Qaeda advisor details how the terror group had warned authorities in the country to stop opposing their actions - or face the prospect of attacks in major cities.

In the letters, bin Laden is also given disturbing updates on terrorist movements around the world - including in Britain, Germany, Turkey and Denmark.

On trial: The documents were declassified in the hope of locking up Naseer Abid

The declassified papers were presented at the trial for Naseer, who is accused of plotting to attack a shopping mall in Manchester, England in 2009, as well as scheming to bomb the New York subway.

He never faced charges in the UK and the evidence against him has only emerged six years after his arrest.

Naseer is alleged to have been at the helm of a British Al-Qaeda terror cell that was part of a broader conspiracy 'to repeat the devastation of 9/11'.

Prosecutors called it one of the most serious terror plots since the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.

As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it is alleged.

Naseer, a former student in the UK studying English and computer science, denies the charges.

He is being tried in the United States because of the alleged subway plot.
