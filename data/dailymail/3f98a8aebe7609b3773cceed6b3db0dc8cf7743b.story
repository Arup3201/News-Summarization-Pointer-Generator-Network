These are the pictures that estate agents hope will entice a - suitably wealthy - buyer who perhaps wants to get away from it all.

For those tempted by the the isolated home, which stands on 
its own island off the Scottish coast, will need deep pockets, as 'King's Island' has gone on sale for a 
cool £3million.

The 260-acre island sits just 350 yards from the coast of west 
Scotland, and has its own helicopter pad next to the remote 
four-bedrooms house which has pride of place on the isolated isle.

This boat jetty looking out on to Loch Craignish is one of very few man-made parts of the isle

Ample space: The four bedroom property on the island has extensive garden and driveway space due to its unique location

Although requiring access by boat or helicopter, the 260-acre island is a haven for many forms of wildlife

As well as the four-bedroom house, the island off Loch Craignish comes 
with a boat house, observatory for gazing at the Northern Lights, and 
its own helicopter facility.

While King's Island may be the ideal hideaway for a James Bond villain, 
its abundance of wildlife makes it a perfect purchase for a nature 
lover.

It is frequently visited by a population of deer that swim over from the
 mainland and the sheltered waters also attract dolphins, otters, sea 
eagles and ospreys.

There is an endless supply of salmon and lobsters that the new owner can exclusively fish for.

The island is currently owned by top City trader Christian Siva-Jothy, a
 former partner in Goldman Sachs, who has modernised the main house.

Room with a view: The owner of the island can look forward to seeing salmon, lobster and other forms of wildife in and around its shores

Spacious: The island also comes with its own boathouse and observatory

He closed down the $200million 
business he began after leaving Goldman Sachs and made a stunning 
confession about his ability to play the market.

Mr Siva-Jothy wrote to investors in his firm SemperMacro: 'In this business, you are only as good as your last few trades.

'Mine have not been very good.  
Whether I have lost my edge or simply need a break after 23 years, I am 
not sure. I certainly hope it’s the latter.'

It is thought his financial misfortune has forced him to sell up.

Previous owners have included Sir Reginald Johnston, a retired tutor to 
Puyi, the last Chinese emperor, in the 1930s and then a retired Indian 
army officer.

Ran Morgan, from the estate agents, said: 'The island is stunningly 
beautiful and surrounded by the most extraordinary land and seascapes.

Isolated: King's Island sits 350 yards from the mainland of west Scotland

Remote: The four bedroom house on the island provides spectacular views, but little neighbourly contact

'It is so peaceful and tranquil yet it only takes 10 minutes to travel 
by boat to reach the mainland or 25 minutes to fly by helicopter to 
Glasgow.

'The coastal village of Ardfern is the nearest settlement and has a large marina, supermarket and a thriving school.

'The wildlife is also quite incredible and while the salmon farm just a 
few yards off the island is privately owned there is nothing to stop you
 from dropping a rod and line into the water.

'The loch is sheltered and is also a wonderful place for water sports like kayaking and diving.

'This is a fantastic opportunity for someone to live a bit of a Robinson Crusoe-type existence and be at one with nature.'
