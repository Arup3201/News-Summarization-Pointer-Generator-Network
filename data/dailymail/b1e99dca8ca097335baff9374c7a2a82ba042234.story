An Indiana woman has been accused of shooting her ex-husband ten times before hiding his body in a large metal box outside her trailer.

Raymond Green's body was found padlocked inside a tool box on land belonging to his ex-wife Danielle Marie Green on May 28.

The 42-year-old had told police they could search everything on her farm except the box, which was covered in flies and smelled of decay.

At first Green, a piano teacher with a MA in music education, told police that she hadn't seen her ex-husband since he got into a fight with her dog on May 26.

But when the 62-year-old's body was discovered in the tool box, she allegedly claimed to have shot him in self-defense.

Results from an autopsy showed that he was shot once in the temple, four times in the back of the head and five times in the body on May 26.

The couple had divorced in January but were still sharing a home at the time of Mr Green's death.

They had moved to Indiana from Florida two years ago to care for Green's parents who had cancer. Her parents died last year.

Green, who has been charged with murder, allegedly told police she killed her ex-husband with a .38 gun that was in his bedroom because he had threatened to kill her.

County prosecutor Aaron Negangard told WCPO: 'He's standing there - doesn't have the gun - but he's standing there and says, "I'm going to kill you. You need to die".

'She pushes him, shoots him five times, goes into a room on the opposite side of the trailer, unloads, reloads ... she shoots him five more times.'

Police were alerted to a possible problem at the couple's farm after the victim's family filed a missing person's report.

When detectives arrived at the couple's home to check on Green's ex-husband, she claimed she hadn't seen him since May 26, when he had a fight with her dog.

Police later discovered she had called his boss on May 27 to claim he had died in an accident over the weekend.

Later that day, she called the boss back and claimed her dog had killed Mr Green.

When detectives searched the couple's property, Green told them they couldn't search the padlocked tool box.

She told Detective Peter Tressler it belonged to her husband and 'she did not want to be responsible for the ramifications of what may be in the box', according to Cincinnati.com.

As well as finding the victim's body in the box, police discovered items that had possibly been used to clean up the trailer after the shooting.

Court documents, seen by Eagle Country Online, showed that in March Green searched the internet for 'headshot from .38 at close range', 'if you shoot someone with a .38 caliber handgun in the head is it lights out or possibly survive' and 'what happens when you get shot in the head'.

Green, who is being held without bond, has pleaded not guilty to murder. Her attorney said he would be raising battered spouse syndrome as a defense.
