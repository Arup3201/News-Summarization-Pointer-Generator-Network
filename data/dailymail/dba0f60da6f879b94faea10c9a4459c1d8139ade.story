The boyfriend of Catherine Wells-Burr appeared in court today accused of conspiracy to murder her.

Rafal Piotr Nowak, 31, faced magistrates in Bristol a day after his former partner, Anna Julia Lagwinowicz, 32, was at the same court to face the same charge.

Nowak is charged with conspiring together with Lagwinowicz and others to murder his girlfriend, which is said to have been committed between May 1 and September 13.

Jeffrey Bannister, defending, did not make an application for bail.

daughter was an 'amazing, special person' who was excited about starting
a new life with her boyfriend.

Catherine; she was full of character, she was caring, loving, and had a 
bubbly personality,' they said in a statement last week.

Meanwhile, police were asking 
motorists travelling along the A358 this morning to cast their minds 
back a week to when Miss Wells-Burr’s body was found.

Drivers with any information were being asked to report it to officers who were at the location between 5am and 7am.

September 12.

Avon and Somerset Police have appealed for witnesses, describing the death as 'tragic and brutal'.

Detective
Inspector Simon Crisp, who is leading the inquiry said: 'I am still 
extremely keen to speak to a number of people who have not yet come 
forward.

you think your information may be, please let us decide.

'It
is also important that we speak with anyone who may have been in the 
area between 3am and 6am on Wednesday, using the roads between Chard and

'Did you see a red

Wells-Burr’s family have released her graduation photo and paid tribute
to a ‘special person’ who had been excited about her future with Nowak.

In a
statement, her mother Jayne, father Phil, sister Leanne and Mr Nowak 
said: ‘We have lost our beautiful Catherine; she was full of character, 
she was caring, loving, and had a bubbly personality.

‘She had a wonderful sense of humour, and was an amazing, special person.

‘Catherine had achieved so much in her short life and had worked so hard to gain her bachelor of honours in business management, gaining a first class degree from Bath Spa University.

‘She was so happy starting her life with Rafal and excited about their future together.

‘We would like to express thanks for all the messages of sympathy and support. We have found some comfort in all the kind and thoughtful words that have been said about Catherine and in knowing how well she was loved.

‘We have found this hard to understand why someone would have done this to her.

‘There are no words to express how we feel about what has happened to her early on Wednesday morning. We desperately need to know why. She will be sadly missed.’

Grieving friends placed bouquets of flowers at the spot where her burning car was discovered.

One heartfelt message read: 'RIP Beautiful. Catherine (Caf), it is hard to believe that you have cruelly been taken from everyone at such a young age.

'You were always such a happy-go-lucky kind of girl, so how can someone be so cold-hearted towards you?

'We may not have spoken out of school but I'm glad to say that I had the privilege to meet such a kind caring intelligent young woman.

'Your life was only really about to start, with so many things to look forwards to.

'You will always be missed. It's nice to see everyone thought so highly of you. Keep smiling, we will find who done this to you sweetie. Rest in peace Caf.

'All my love to you and your family, Becky Wood.

'We didn't lose a life, we gained an angel.'

Another tribute left at the sad scene read: 'Caf, rest in peace lovely lady. We will always remember you and your smile. You have been taken too soon from us all.

'Thinking of you, your family and your friends at this sad time. Heaven has gained an angel. Sleep well, we will never forget.

'Lots of love Gem Shaw and family and Chris Fox.'

A third message left on flowers said: 'Dear Caf, you were taken away far too young and in such a horrible way.

Intelligent: Ms Wells-Burr, who lived in Chard, Somerset with her family, studied business management at Bath Spa University and passed with first-class honours

'You were always a beautiful caring loving girl.

'I will never forget the laughs we had together, mainly in the pub, and mostly I will never ever forget you.

'You'll always be in my thoughts. Sleep tight angel. Sending you and your family all my love, RIP, Lucy Knight.'

Another sad friend simply wrote: 'Caf, this isn't fair. Words fail me. Sleep well. Xxx'
