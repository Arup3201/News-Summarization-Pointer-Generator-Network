At first blush, it sounds like an unlikely union. But it appears Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has found a new friend in actress Liz Hurley after the pair bonded over his pet kitten.

The former rebel fighter and Miss Hurley met after she arrived in Chechnya to begin filming a thriller with French actor Gerard Depardieu.

The pair can be seen chatting and apparently bonding over a cute fluffy white kitten in a series of images posted on the Chechen leader's Instagram account.

Kadyrov and Hurley were introduced by her co-star Depardieu who became friends with the Muslim Chechen leader at his birthday celebrations two years ago.

Hurley, who has previously starred in comedy films Austin Powers and Bedazzled, and Depardieu were both in town to start filming Turquoise, a new movie about a French art thief and his Russian former flame.

Depardieu, who has become a Russian citizen,  took the opportunity  to catch up with his old friend while filming in the Chechen capital which has been rebuilt under Kadyrov after it was left in ruins less than a decade ago.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was split into the Republic of Ingushetia and the Chechen Republic.

Following the First Chechen War with Russia, Chechnya gained de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.

Russian federal control was restored during the Second Chechen War. Kadyrov is now Head of the Chechen Republic.

The actor then introduced pro-Russian Kadyrove to his co-star. And judging from the photos posted online, Kadyrov and Hurley hit it off straight away.

The images were made public as Hurley and Depardieu held a press conference in the capital.

During
the meeting, Depardieu claimed the ethnic Chechen brothers accused of 
the Boston marathon bombing had been raised American and that residents 
of the volatile Russian region of Chechnya were not to blame.

The actor, who accepted Russian citizenship after quitting France to avoid a planned 75 per cent tax on millionaires, was echoing earlier comments from his friend Ramzan Kadyrov.

'I was in the United States when the terrorist act was carried out in Boston. I agree with Ramzan Kadyrov who said that the Tsarnaev brothers have a Chechen last name but their upbringing is American,' Depardieu said at a news conference. You (Chechens) don't carry any responsibility.'

Kadyrov, who has been criticised for his strongarm rule, says tough policies are required in Chechnya to control Islamist violence in the North Caucasus where insurgents wage almost daily violence to create an Islamic state.

He has denied that Chechnya had any links to the Tsarnaev brothers, accused of blasts that killed three people and injured 264 others at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

U.S. investigators are looking into links between Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a gun battle with police, and extremists who wage violence in the mountainous Russian region near Sochi, where Russia plans to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics.
