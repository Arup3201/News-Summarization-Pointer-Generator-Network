Sopranos actor Lillo Brancato took to Twitter to announce his release New Year's Eve after serving four years of a ten year sentence for his part in a burglary that resulted in the death of a NYPD officer - to the fury of the dead man's family.

Brancato who appeared in early episodes of the critically acclaimed HBO series will be released from the Hudson Correctional Facility and was sentenced in 2009 after the botched home invasion which led to the death of off-duty cop Daniel Enchautegui.

The New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Assocation also said on Monday that they were outraged by this decision and reiterated their belief that Brancato was responsible for Enchautegui's murder - despite him being found guilty only of attempted burglary.

Yolanda Rosa, the sister of Enchautegui said that she was notified only on Tuesday that Brancato would be released on Wednesday - after being granted parole earlier in the month.

'I’m still upset that he was not convicted of the murder, and that he did not serve enough time,' Yolanda Rosa said to the New York Post.

'I don’t know how I will feel tomorrow when he is free, walking on the streets, while my brother will not.'

Authorities told Rosa that Brancato had been a model prisoner behind bars, a suggestion she scoffed at.

'Well, he wasn't a model citizen before — we’ll see if he’s a model citizen after he gets out,' she added.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, Rosa expressed her disbelief that the once-promising young actor would be released so soon.

'He didn’t serve enough time. He was equally as responsible as the other guy,' Rosa said.

'Not a day goes by that I don’t think about my brother.'

Announcement: Lillo Brancato took to Twitter from prison to announce that he was being released from jail on December 31

Grief: Police Officer Daniel Enchautegui's father Pedro Enchautegui (3rd L) is consoled by a police officer as others prepare to carry his casket out of St. John's Chrysostom Church after his funeral mass in New York December 14, 2005

In their case, prosecutors said that in December 2005, Brancato and Steven Armento broke into the Bronx apartment of a friend looking to steal prescription drugs after a night of drinking at a strip club.

Officer Enchautegui heard the commotion next door from his apartment and went to investigate.

Armento shot the 28-year-old officer with the .357 Magnum he was carrying in the heart and the dying officer fired back shooting both men.

As a result of the death of an officer, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder - but was only convicted of burglary in 2008 and was sentenced to serve 10 years and five-years probation in 2009.

Armento was sentenced to life in prison without parole after being found guilty of first-degree murder.

In a statement Monday, PBA President Patrick J. Lynch said he believed Brancato was guilty in the officer’s death.

'It is our firm belief that Lillo Brancato is guilty of the murder of police officer Daniel Enchautequi even though he was only convicted of attempted burglary.

'Even while incarcerated, this lowlife thug showed his true colors when he beat up a fellow inmate who wouldn’t get off a pay phone quickly enough,' Lynch said in the statement.

Promising: Lillo Brancato with Robert De Niro as they film Bronx Tale in 1993

Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association trustee Joe Anthony said he was outraged by the decision by the parole board.

'I sat in the courtroom everyday with the family while that smug punk smiled and laughed at them,' he said.

'I hope someone taught him respect in prison.'

Brancato, who was allowed to maintain a Twitter account while serving his sentence posted a message of thanks online to all his supporters.

'With that being said, this will be my last tweet from prison. Thank you for your love and support. I love you all!' he tweeted to his 3,364 followers.

Brancato rose to fame in the 1993 movie A Bronx Tale, playing a young kid from the neighborhood who is torn between two worlds and two men: a local mobster played by Chazz Palminteri and his straight-and-narrow bus-driver father, played by Robert De Niro.

Other roles followed, most notably a stint on the second season of The Sopranos. His character carried out a series of low-level crimes for the New Jersey mob before being gunned down by Tony Soprano and his sidekick as he tearfully begged for his life.

HBO hit : Lillo Brancato appears in the seminal mob drama The Sopranos in the early years of the 2000s

Brancato, now 36, and Armento, 51 , were drinking together at a strip club in December 2005 before deciding to break into the basement apartment in a hunt for Valium, prosecutors said during the 2008 trial.

Brancato testified during the trial there was a never a break-in.

He claimed that he had known the owner, a Vietnam veteran, for several years. He also said he had permission to go inside and take painkillers and other pills whenever he felt like it, and didn't know the man had died earlier that year.

The pills were part of a drug problem that he said began when he was 'introduced to marijuana' on the set of A Bronx Tale. He later became hooked on crack and heroin, he said.

He told the jury that while suffering from judgment-impairing heroin withdrawals on the night of the shooting, he accidentally broke the kitchen window of the apartment in a desperate attempt to wake up his old pill-supplier.

'I was becoming dope sick,' Brancato testified. 'Mentally, I was a mess.'

Brancato tried to deflect suggestions by the prosecution that his testimony — at times punctuated by vignettes about his drug-crazed downfall — was another acting job.
