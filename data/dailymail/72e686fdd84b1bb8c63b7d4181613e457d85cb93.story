Downing Street only searched for messages mentioning the BSkyB takeover when officials handed over a cache of texts between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks to the Leveson Inquiry, it has emerged.

The disclosure raises the prospect that dozens of personal texts between the Prime Minister and the former News International chief executive have been kept back from the probe into Press standards.

MPs are now demanding that Mr Cameron publish all his texts with Mrs Brooks.

Busy texter: Dozens of personal texts between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks may have been undisclosed to the Leveson Inquiry

A No 10 source told the Mail the Prime Minister had made clear in his Leveson evidence statement that officials ‘only searched for texts related to the BSkyB deal’.

This refers to the doomed attempt by Rupert Murdoch’s News International to take over a majority holding in the satellite TV company, which has been a major focus of the Leveson Inquiry. The source said officials had ‘never searched for texts in general’.

Labour MP Chris Bryant, who has been submitting repeated questions to Mr Cameron over the extent of his contact with Mrs Brooks, said yesterday: ‘The Prime Minister is putting up a public image of being transparent but I think voters would want to see the full extent of his messages.

'Before Leveson finishes his report, the Prime Minister should publish all texts, emails and other correspondence between himself and News International’.

The renewed call follows the leak of two embarrassing messages between the premier and the former newspaper boss in the Mail on Sunday. In one, Mrs Brooks texted Mr Cameron, then leader of the Opposition, after his 2009 conference speech, saying: ‘Brilliant speech. I cried twice. Will love “working together”.’

Mr Cameron continued to stay in touch with Mrs Brooks, who is married to his former school friend Charlie Brooks, even  after she stepped down last  year in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

Mr Bryant has also revealed  that 130 to 150 texts and emails held by No 10 have never been sent to the Leveson Inquiry.

He claimed he had spoken to a mole in No 10 about the messages and accused the PM of seeking to conceal them because they are ‘salacious and far more embarrassing’.

Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks met 22 times in a six-year period.
