The mother of a soldier who committed suicide has bravely decided to allow footage of his lifeless body at a public inquiry into the military's handling of her son's death.

Corporal Stuart Langridge's body was found hanging from a chin-up bar in his barracks after the Afghanistan veteran was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder.

His mother claims the 28-year-old, who was found hanged in at Canadian Forces Base Edmonton, was not properly treated for his condition, having already attempted suicide five times in one year.

It has now emerged that after hanging himself on March 15 2008, Cpl Langridge's body was left in place for four hours by investigators while they documented and searched everything in the room.

Graphic, disturbing images of Cpl Langridge's body were never released to news media, but have since been played at the public inquiry into his death.

The inquiry is set to investigate not only the Defence Department's handling of Cpl Langridge's case, but also how it copes with soldiers suffering from mental illness and post-traumatic stress.

Cpl Langridge had previously said he would rather die than return to his unit, having served in tours of Bosnia and Afghanistan.

He attempted suicide six times in 2008 before his eventual death, had been treated in hospital and resorted to alcohol and cocaine.

His mother, Sheila Fynes, said decisions made by military medical staff during the last weeks of his life were 'thoughtless, humiliating and destabilizing.'

Describing the decision to allow footage of his death at the inquiry, she told the Globe and Mail: 'There are times when I think I’ve shared the most personal thing about Stuart’s life and I hope... I hope it wasn’t for nothing.'

The distressing footage zooms in on Cpl Langridge's head and face. Federal lawyers representing the Defence Department said that if the video were to be shown, it would have to be shown completely.

Claims: Shaun Fynes and wife Sheila listen to testimony at the public inquiry in Ottawa earlier this year, where they say decisions made by military medical staff during the last weeks of his life were 'thoughtless, humiliating and destabilizing.'

Mrs Fynes added: 'At first, we said: "No, we don’t want anybody ever to see that".

'But then [after] discussions with our lawyer [and] between ourselves, we decided there would be no better way for the chair to understand our allegation of the total disrespect shown to Stuart in his death, than for him to see it.'

'Was it the right decision? It keeps me awake at night.'

After Cpl Langridge's death, further blunders by the Defence Department added to the grief his family were going through.

The military took a year and two months to deliver Langridge's suicide note to his devastated parents.

Cpl Langridge's family have accused members of the National Investigative Service of conducting a biased investigation intent on absolving high-ranking members of the Canadian Forces of blame.
