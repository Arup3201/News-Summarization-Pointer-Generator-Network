Doctor Nazim Mahmood, 34, fell to his death from a penthouse in West Hampstead, London

A Harley Street doctor killed himself by jumping from his penthouse flat after his Muslim mother told him to cure himself of being gay when he told her he was engaged to a man, an inquest heard.

Nazim Mahmood, 34, was seen standing alone on the balcony of his £700,000 apartment in West Hampstead, London, before falling four storeys in front of shocked passers-by.

An inquest heard Dr Mahmood had hid his sexuality from his Muslim family in fear that they would refuse to accept it on religious and cultural grounds, it has been reported.

But he decided to tell his mother he was gay and in a 13-year relationship with with his fiancé Matthew Ogston  in July, according to the Evening Standard.

He had returned to the family home in Birmingham to celebrate Eid but days later Dr Mahmood, who ran Face Clinic London which provides wrinkle treatments like Botox, was found dead.

Long-term partner, Mr Ogston, told the inquest yesterday: 'She had suggested to him he needed to see a psychiatrist to see if he could be cured. Together I think they agreed they would get through it.'

He wept in court as he described Dr Mahmood as his 'soulmate' and said his fiancé had given no indication that he had intentions of killing himself.

'He always wanted to help other people, always put other people first and wanted to care for people. He was quite simply the most amazing man I'll ever meet in my whole life,' he added.

The court heard Dr Mahmood, who had never suffered from depression or any other mental illness, had taken drugs mephedrone and ketamine shortly before his death. 

Coroner Mary Hassell, hearing the case at St Pancras Coroners' Court, ruled that Dr Mahmood took his own life.

She said: 'It seems incredible that a young man with so much going for him could have taken his own life. But what I've heard is that he had one great sadness which was the difficulty his family had in accepting his sexuality.'

Dr Mahmood graduated from the University of Birmingham medical school in 2003 and moved to London a year later.

Dr Mahmood was one of the doctors behind Face Clinics, a chain offering treatments in three locations across London.

The clinics, which employed five specialists, offer treatments including Botox, skin fillers, exfoliation, sweat treatments and semi-permanent makeup.

Prices for Botox treatments begin at £200, with cheaper procedures from £75 and offers for going with friends.

Earlier this week the chain posted a message online enticing customers to mimic the look of model Cara Delevigne by indulging in a semi-permanent eyebrow treatment.

Customers writing on the site named Dr Mahmood as part of the 'friendly and inviting' clinic who 'put me at ease' before a Botox treatment.

He worked in a number of teaching hospitals in different specialities including, accident and emergency, HIV medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics, before completing his specialist training as a GP.

In 2009 he founded Face Clinic London with a colleague, Dr Anita Kapoor, and was due to unveil another new clinic just yards from his home after success with his Soho and Harley Street clinics.

Dr Mahmood fell naked from the building at about 5.35pm on July 30 this year, in front of shocked passers-by, including children.

A passing doctor attempted to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

After the fall, Dr Mahmood was left covered in just a blanket - in front of the mansion block and a busy Barclays Bank - for more than three hours.

Police said at the time there were no police tents available to 'shield the body' and apologised for any distress caused.

Mr Ogston has since set up the Naz and Matt Foundation, which provides free support to LGBT individuals and their friends and family going through a difficult time because of their sexuality or gender identity.
