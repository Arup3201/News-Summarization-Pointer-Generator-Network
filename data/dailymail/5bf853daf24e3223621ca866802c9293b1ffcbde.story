A 15-year-old girl who made a heartbreaking video about the abuse she suffered at the hands of bullies died last week.

Toni Connell died in hospital after emergency services were called to her home in South Ockendon, Essex, last Wednesday.

It came just weeks after the year 11 student was told she would not be allowed to sit the higher paper in her upcoming GCSE maths exam and would therefore be unable to achieve and A or B grade.

The circumstances of Toni's death are not yet known but it is not being treated as suspicious by police.

Speaking yesterday, her mother, Amanda Connell, 46, said she believed academic pressure had led to her daughter's death.

The mother-of three also said the schoolgirl had been the victim of cyber-bullying and had received death threats on Facebook.

She said: 'We found out during a parents evening a few weeks ago that Toni would not be allowed to do A and B questions in her maths exam.

'We had been discussing [the exam] just hours before she died. The school puts a lot of pressure on the children - they have to take some responsibility and make changes.

'She was going in at 7.30 in the morning and coming home at 4pm exhausted as she was trying to fit in extra study sessions.

'Once Year 11 hit the pressure increased even more and I think it just became unbearable for her. 

Heartbreaking: Two of the notes featured in the five-minute video Toni uploaded to the internet last March

In one note she said she was '14, but so small' and in another said 'Loads of stuff gets spread about me'

Toni Connell wrote 'loads of people hate me' on one heartbeaking note and held up another message saying 'been bullied since year 7'

Bullied: The handwritten notes showed names that Toni had been called, including 'ugly'

Desperate plea: Messages included the words 'I don't know what to do' and 'suicidal 5 times'

'We are hurting right now but if Toni's death can prevent another child needlessly dying then she will at least have achieved something.'

In March last year, Toni uploaded a heartbreaking video to  in which she shared how she had 'one true friend' and that 'loads of people hate' her.

On handwritten notes, she wrote: 'The next three names I have been called... ugly, lesbian tramp.'

She also shared: 'to be popular you have to be a s**g long hair pretty, have boobs'.

One card read: 'Suicidal 5 times.' The next: 'Don't do suicide. Don't let them win'.

Asked about an anti-bullying video online posted by Toni, Mrs Connell added: 'I am very angry with the school as they knew she was being bullied but never did anything about it. 

'I know children must have picked on her about her brace as she had been excited about getting it but once she went to school she was immediately begging us to have it taken off.

'I didn't even know about the video though.' 

Paying tribute to her daughter, she said: 'Toni was bubbly and talkative. She loved animals - we had 13 rabbits but her pride and joy was her hamster, Tibbles.

Remembered: Candles,  flowers and what appears to be a signed school shirt have been left in tribute

'She was always singing and dancing. Her ambition was to be an actress on Hollyoaks and she had an audition for a drama college that she was looking forward to attending.' 

Paramedics and the air ambulance were called to Toni's home last Wednesday but were unable to revive her. She later died at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex. 

A police statement said: 'Specially-trained officers have been providing support to Toni's family. Her death is not being treated as suspicious.' A date has not yet been set for the inquest. 

Commenting on Toni's death, a school spokesman said: 'It is with great sadness that we are coming to terms with the death of Toni. 

'The whole school community is deeply affected by this tragedy.' 

Barbara King, the academy's executive principal said: 'The Ockendon Academy has been working closely with Thurrock Council’s Children’s Services as well as Community Adolescent Mental Health Services to support our young people and staff in the school following the tragic death of Year 11 student Toni Connell.

'We are aware that this tragic news can lead to speculation in the press and on social media regarding the circumstances around Toni’s death and have advised parents that police are working to establish the circumstances surrounding the tragedy and how it would be inappropriate for the school to comment further while those investigations continue.

'Parents are also being advised if they have any concerns regarding their children they should contact the school directly so we can ensure they get access to support in school and so we can offer further one-to-one advice.'

Ockendon Academy chair of governors, Rev Brian Duckworth, said in an online statement: 'It is with great sadness that we have to inform you that we have learned today of the death of a young person, Toni Connell a year 11 student at our school.

'We know that your children may be deeply affected by this sad news and we have offered support to all students in the school and there will be additional counselling available.

'If you have concerns about your child please let the school know so we can make support available for them next week.

'If your child needs to talk to someone over the weekend please be aware that the Childline telephone service is available on 0800 1111.

'Clearly we would like to express our thoughts and deepest sympathy to her family at this time.' 

Councillor John Kent, leader of Thurrock Council and portfolio holder for education, said: 'I am pleased the council has been able to support the academy in its time of trouble and I would call on the local community to do the same.'
