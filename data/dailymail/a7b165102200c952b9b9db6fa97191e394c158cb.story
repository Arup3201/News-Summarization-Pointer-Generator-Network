It's the day she's been dreaming of for so, so long.

Finally, a judge was able to undo the mistake that was Kim Kardashian's 72 day marriage to Kris Humphries after 536 days of bitter negotiations.

This means the 32-year-old will be able to give birth to her first child in July without still being married to Humphries, and therefore should be an extra special time for both her and the baby's father, beau Kanye West.

So sad: Kim Kardashian should've been celebrating on Friday when she was finally rid of Kris Humphries, but her beau Kanye West has been in Paris since February

But on Friday, as a sad looking Kim dealt with the court date alone, as Kanye, 35, was nowhere to be seen.

He's in Paris, and he has been since 
fashion week, and while the two have flown back and forth to see one 
another, it's baffling many people that they're spending so much time 
apart.

Especially when you'd expect a 
superstar with a private jet to want to be at his partner's side for 
such a big event in their lives.

A spokesperson for Kim has yet to return Mail Online's request for comment.

Kim cut a lonely figure in court and barely raised a smile when a judge granted her divorce.

'I think this is a reasonable way to resolve this case,' said Superior Court Judge Hank Goldberg, who did not disclose terms of the settlement.

Humphries sent his lawyer but did not appear in court.

Together but apart: Kim has been based in Los Angeles throughout her pregnancy while her boyfriend Kanye West has mostly been in Paris since February

'Ms. Kardashian, is this your signature?' the judge asked her as he perused a three-page settlement agreement.

'Yes,' she replied. She continued to 
answer yes when asked if she had discussed the matter with her lawyer 
and understood that there would be no trial.

'During your marriage did irreconcilable differences occur?' the judge asked, 'no' she replied.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Kris told TMZ: Kris and his family are excited to move forward and are grateful for all the support they have received in this process."

The rep then sets the priorities straight:  "His commitment to the Brooklyn Nets and the team's incredible fans is his number one priority and he is excited to head into the playoffs tomorrow with this situation behind him.'

Swellagant: Kim looked lovely in a black shirt dress with pleated skirt as she arrived for her date with destiny

Sombre: Kim was classy enough to wear black and not look too pleased about the whole debacle

Where the magic happened: Kim learned at Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday that she's officially free of Humphries

But a sombre-looking Kim acquitted 
herself well by refusing to revel in getting the verdict she wanted, and
looked stunning in a beautiful, suitably black fitted dress.

It's been a dirty fight, with each camp going back and forth with tales of betrayal and deceit.

A
source even claimed that Kris was the one who persuaded his estranged 
wife to take the honeymoon trip to the Amalfi Coast in Italy.

‘Kris was the one to push for the 
honeymoon. Kim didn’t want to go on the honeymoon because they were 
scheduled to move to New York City to begin filming Kourtney & Kim 
Take New York,’ a source told Radar Online.

‘Kim finally relented. Kris was 
absolutely dumbfounded when a photographer appeared out of nowhere and 
started taking pics of them by the pool,’ the source said. ‘Kim happily 
posed, and Kris realised her camp had arranged it.’

Respectful: You could've expected Kim to do a little jig but she behaved with impressive decorum

Stylish: The court date mustered a delightful outfit from Kim

At her divorce deposition Kim 
confessed that she was against going on the holiday, which Kris is 
allegedly using as part of his case against the 32-year-old reality 
star, claiming their marriage was fraud.

On Wednesday Kim, who is pregnant with her first child, was seen looking somber as she arrived at a Los Angeles studio alone.

Her
boyfriend Kanye West meanwhile has been based in Paris since Fashion 
Week in February, with Kim regularly flying over to visit him.

It's over! Kim is finally free of Kris after 536 days of dispute over their marriage

Over before it began: Kim and Kris called time on their marriage after 72 days but the divorce has taken much, much longer to sort

Oh Kim! Wearing a sexy camisole over jeans is probably one of Kim's worst maternity moments

Another dubious ensemble: Kim stepped out for lunch at LA Scala in Beverly Hills on Thursday
