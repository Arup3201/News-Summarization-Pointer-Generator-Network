Chris Powell has been appointed manager of Championship side Huddersfield Town and replaces Mark Robins who lost his job after the first match of the season.

Former Charlton boss and England international Powell takes the reins with the club in 21st place in the league after five games.

The move also makes Powell the only black manager in the Football League.

Done deal: Former Charlton boss Chris Powell has been appointed the new Huddersfield Town manager

Powell said on his return to management: 'I'm honoured to be the man chosen to lead Huddersfield forward.

'It was right to bring it to this point - an international break where players can recharge and the chosen applicant would have enough time with the team leading up to the next Championship game.

'There's a good squad here already with lots of experience, potential and some good young players.

'The loan window opens soon so hopefully there will be a chance to move a few players - some hopefully coming in and maybe some who need to go and play some football and get some experience.

'I'm sure we'll have a really competitive squad, then come January if we're able to enquire about players and bring players in permanently then we'll do that.' 

Huddersfield Town Chairman Dean Hoyle told the Terriers’ website:’We’re delighted to be able to welcome Chris to Huddersfield Town as the new Manager.

‘We’ve taken our time over this appointment, as we wanted to give ourselves time to put in the groundwork and ensure we get the right man for the job. We believe we have in Chris.

‘As I said when the process began, I felt it was important that we found a Manager who had ‘done it’ and Chris certainly fits that bill. He has ‘done it’ by guiding Charlton to promotion to the Championship and then finishing ninth in the 2012/13 Championship season – all achieved on a limited budget by getting the best out of his players.

Tough task: Powell takes the reins with the club in 21st place in league after five games

‘Chris also has an excellent pedigree of developing young players, with the likes of Carl Jenkinson, Diego Poyet, Callum Harriott and Jordan Cousins emerging in Charlton’s First Team under his guidance. That is an important factor in our vision for the Club.

‘As a player, a Coach and a Manager, Chris knows what it takes to succeed at Championship level. Alongside his experience with Charlton, he was also promoted out of this division three times during his playing career and has become accustomed to winning.

‘We’ve met Chris to discuss the job in two long meetings and both times he has impressed us with his enthusiasm, passion and knowledge of Huddersfield Town and the Championship. 

Gone: Mark Robins left the Terriers after an opening day defeat against Bournemouth 

'He is personally highly motivated and we feel he will get the best from the players. His record demands respect and we think he is the ideal man to take this Club forward.

‘Make no mistake – throughout the football industry, Chris is held in extremely high regard. This is an excellent fit with the Club and how we operate.’
