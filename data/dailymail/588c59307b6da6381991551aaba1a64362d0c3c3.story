A personal assistant whose boss told her he wanted 'to trade her in for a younger model' has won a claim for unfair dismissal at a tribunal.

Dawn Bailey, 52, said she felt she had to leave her £75,000 a year job at defence giant Lockheed Martin last February after she developed the chronic illness sarcoidosis and depression around the time she turned 50.

She was PA to chief executive Stephen Ball but told the tribunal he repeatedly poked fun at her age and said her illness was 'disruptive'.

Dawn Bailey, right, won her unfair dismissal case but the tribunal found comments made by Stephen Ball, left, about 'a younger model' were made in jest

When she confided in him that she had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis, a disease which causes swelling of the joints and a shortness of breath, he told her: 'You being ill is disruptive to me and others in the office'.

Despite working for the company for 19 years she resigned last February because it was 'impossible' for her to stay, she said.

The Central London Employment Tribunal ruled that Miss Bailey, of Winfarthing, Norfolk, had been wrongfully dismissed from her job and subjected to unfavourable treatment because she suffered from depression.

They said that the multi-billion pound company should have appreciated that 'more attention' needed to be given to supporting Miss Bailey after she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in November 2011.

The tribunal said the comment about 'a younger model' was made as a joke and rejected a claim for age discrimination but ruled she had been treated unfavourably because of her disability.

The tribunal had heard that Miss Bailey had an 'unblemished' career at the military giant, but her relations with her boss Mr Ball began to sour towards the end of 2010 after she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, a chronic illness she had watched her father died from 25 years earlier.

Over the following year Miss Bailey took several weeks off work sick, and the tribunal found that in her absence her job was slimmed down and sidelined.

The 52 year-old also told the tribunal that around this time Mr Ball repeatedly told her 'I need to trade you in for a younger model' and 'It is time for a younger, new team'.

In December 2011 she was suspended on 'management directed leave' pending an evaluation of her health by an occupational health expert, and escorted from the company’s offices.

Three months later she resigned having 'concluded that all confidence and trust had been destroyed by the company'.

Finding that Miss Bailey 'was marginalised' after her return to work, the tribunal said: 'First, such treatment did occur, in the sense that, as we have found, the claimant did not receive proactive support from HR reintegrating and her withdrawn behaviour was met with a degree of cold-shouldering, rather than proactive and sympathetic support.'

They did not find that her boss' comments constituted age discrimination because it was said in jest.

The ruling said Mr Ball had 'intended the remark to be humorous and friendly'.

Miss Bailey’s solicitor Paul McAleavey said her case highlighted the discrimination faced by many middle aged women in UK workplaces.

He said: 'We are really pleased with the ruling. Only three per cent of discrimination claims that reach a tribunal are successful so to have arrived at that upper percentile is great. It is a weight of Miss Bailey’s mind.

'This was a woman in her fifties taking on a multi national arms manufacturer and winning on the majority of her claims.'

Mr McAleavey said his client had sent out a job application for every working day she has been out of work but has not been invited for one interview.

He said: 'She believes it is because of he age. Companies don’t want to hire people in their fifties.'

Branding as 'puzzling' the tribunal’s dismissal of comments made by Mr Ball that he wanted to trade Miss Bailey in for a younger model as 'humorous', Mr McAleavey said they would consider appealing that part of the ruling.

He said: 'It is very strange. On the face of it it would give any business the right to say, for example, "I want to get rid of you because you are Irish and get someone more reliable in" and then say "I am not racist, it was only a joke". It does lead to that slightly uncomfortable proposition.'

Miss Bailey declined to comment on the ruling.

A remedy hearing will beheld at Central London Employment Tribunal next month when a panel will decide how much compensation Miss Bailey will be awarded.
