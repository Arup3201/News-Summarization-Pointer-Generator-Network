A New York businessman claims that Jill Kelley was so eager to close a billion-dollar business deal that the Florida socialite stood up her own husband on their anniversary.

Kelley reportedly met Adam Victor at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Shortly after they were introduced by mutual friend Don Phillips, the two began to talk business.

Victor is the president and CEO of TransGas Development Systems, a New York-based firm dedicated to the pursuit of clean energy.

Connections: Emails reveal that Jill Kelley, pictured leaving her Florida home last week, bailed on anniversary plans with her husband with the goal of sealing an energy deal

Kelley claimed that in her capacity as honorary consul for South Korea, she could help Victor set up a coal plant there.

Emails between Kelley and Victor exclusively obtained by ABC News revealed how Kelley doggedly pursued the deal.

At one point, Kelley emailed Victor: 'Adam, I'm on my flight. It was wonderful to meet with you. I was quite impressed learning about the project to say the least.

'I'm emailing around some contacts, calling in favors, and totally anxious to take this to the next step. It has HUGE potential. It just needs a catalyst like me. :-)'

While wheeling and dealing with Victor, Phillips claimed to ABC that Kelley wasn't interested in moving forward, telling him: 'As a result of my personal investigations and business intelligence this is just not going anywhere, Don, and you just don't want to associate with [Victor].'

But Kelley soon emailed one of Victor's employee, saying she was blowing off her husband Scott on their anniversary so that she could speak more about the South Korea deal.

The email shown to the network read: '[M]y husband is in agreement with me canceling our 13th Anniversary dinner plans. Please call me.'

But the deal apparently collapsed 
when Kelley informed Victor of the commission she was hoping to take in 
for helping to complete the deal - a whopping 2 per cent, or $80million.

Victor's
next email informed Kelley: 'The suggested fee you have asked for is so
out of market, I have no way of working out any acceptable deal with 
you. You should not contact anyone on our behalf.'

Victor
said he was told by Kelley that Petraeus had set her up as an honorary 
consul to South Korea, a claim refuted by the general's longtime 
spokesman, retired Army Col Steve Boylan.

Phillips, Kelley's friend, also told ABC that she has never sought any benefits from 
her friendship with the disgraced general.

Socialite: Kelley kisses General Petraeus at an awards ceremony for him at her home last year

Kelley is the woman who blew the lid off the Petraeus affair and ensuing scandal after she received threatening emails from the generals mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell.

It was revealed on Tuesday that the Florida socialite took multiple flights aboard military aircraft on the taxpayers' dime.

She even reportedly flew to 
Washington, DC, with General John Allen - the military commander she is 
said to have exchanged tens of thousands of emails with while he was in 
Afghanistan.

It is not 
known why Kelley, 37, flew to the U.S. capital with Allen but it has 
emerged that in recent months she has had three visits to the White 
House.

The mother of three from Tampa has so far refused to comment publicly on her role in the scandal that ended the career of CIA director Petraeus and put the distinguished career of Allen in jeopardy.

The commander of the coalition forces in Afghanistan is under investigation for 'flirty' emails said to number as many as 30,000 that he exchanged with Kelley.

An investigation by 10 News Tampa has revealed that Kelley, whose complaint over threatening emails revealed David Petraeus' affair, has enjoyed several trips on military planes.

The news stations said they have made several requests to defense officials to see how many times Kelley has flown from the MacDill Air Force base where she acted as an unpaid social liaison officer.

Pentagon officials told News 10 they have not been able to track down the exact number of flights. But they did confirm she flew on a KC-135 jet in May 2010.

The KC-135 jets are primarily used to refuel other aircraft in mid-air.

'It's an educational opportunity for people to just see what hard working military members are doing each day,' Lt. Col. Jack Miller told the TV station.

Officials said about 150 people each year take an orientation flight at MacDill, with the flights leaving and then returning to Tampa.

'I've seen anything from community leaders to Cub Scouts to sports teams.

'But by in large, it's generally folks throughout the community that just have an interest in the instillation. Sometimes it's just a matter of requesting to do it.'

Kelley, who is mired in debt and facing foreclosure on her $1.3million home overlooking Tampa Bay, sparked the investigation into Petraeus after she went to the FBI after receiving threatening emails from Paula Broadwell, the general's biographer.

Unstoppable: Jill Kelley, pictured with General Petraeus and his wife Holly at her home last year, visited the White House three times in three months as the guest of an aide, it has emerged

'Courtesy': Kelley and her sister were invited to dine at the White House on two occasions by a mid-level aide

The latest example of how she rubbed 
shoulders with the military's top brass comes after it emerged she has 
visited the White House three times in the past three months.

The shrewd socialite and
her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, were invited to two 'courtesy' meals 
in the Executive Mansion mess hall as a guest of a White House aide.

She
met the mid-level aide through her work with MacDill Air Force Base 
near Tampa, where she also rubbed shoulders with the military bosses 
including General Petraeus.

On one further occasion, she received a White House tour with her family, the official added.

It confirms that Kelley was telling the truth in an email she wrote to a reporter at the Tampa Bay Times on September 28, in which she boasted of visiting the White House.

'Btw I was made the [honorary] Ambassador to US Central Command's Coalition!' she wrote. 'In addition to that, I was just recently appointed to be the Honorary Consulate General to South Korea! I'm in DC today - just left from breakfast at the White House.... I really hope to see you soon!'

Kelley's shrewd social-climbing 
tactics also came to light this week when she was pictured with Marco 
Rubio and her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, when he was running for the Senate.

The photograph was tweeted by Republican Angelette Aviles who said that it was taken at a March 2010 fundraiser, where tickets were $1,000.

But the twins didn't pay - instead, they
appeared to have taken the photo and left, Aviles told the Tampa Bay Times, and never contributed to the Rubio campaign.

Yet over the past week, Kelley's connections have given her more exposure than she was perhaps intending.

After Petraeus dramatically resigned from the top of the CIA last Friday, it emerged that Kelley had played a key role in exposing his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.

Affair: Kelley tipped off the FBI about threatening emails she received from Paula Broadwell, right, and during their investigation they uncovered her affair with David Petraeus

In May, Kelley alerted the FBI that 
she had been receiving threatening, anonymous emails warning her to 
'back off' Petraeus, whom Kelley and her husband are good friends with.

The
FBI was forced to launch an in-depth investigation as some messages 
contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts, and they 
feared there could have been a security breach.

The catty emails were traced back to Broadwell and, in the process of the investigation, agents also uncovered messages revealing the affair between the biographer and Petraeus.

The scandal later dragged in another general, the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen, after the FBI investigated Kelley's emails from Broadwell.

During the probe, they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email correspondence between Allen and Kelley, which officials said were 'flirtatious' and likened them to 'phone sex'.

Both Allen and Kelley deny any wrongdoing. But Kelley has been told has been that she is no longer welcome at the military headquarters near her Florida home.
