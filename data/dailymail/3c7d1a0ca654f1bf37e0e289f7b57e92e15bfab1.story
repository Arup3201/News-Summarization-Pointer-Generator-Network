It has the reputation of being one of the best hangover cures around and is also one of the simplest cocktails to make. 

Now one American bar has taken things to a new level and paired their Bloody Mary with another staple of the morning after - 4lb of fried food.

But Sobelman's Pub and Grill in Milwaukee Wisconsin, US, has topped their jug - dubbed the  Chicken Fried Bloody Beast - with a whole fried bird.

A happy customer at Sobelman's Pub and Grill in Milwaukee Wisconsin, US, holds up the $50 Chicken Fried Bloody Beast: a jug of Bloody Mary topped off with a whole fried chicken

The super-size drink also comes embellished with cheese, sausage, pickles, olives, onion, mushrooms, asparagus, spring onions, shrimp, lemon, Brussels sprouts, tomato, celery and two Baconadoes

The crazy cocktail is served in a jug that is the size of four regular sized Bloody Marys. 

The drink, which is usually embellished with a celery stick, comes instead with a four-pound chicken. 

It is also garnished with  cheese, sausage, pickles, olives, onion, mushrooms, asparagus, spring onions, shrimp, lemon, Brussels sprouts, tomato, celery and two Baconadoes (skewers of bacon-wrapped jalapeno cheeseballs). 

The $50 (£33) Chicken Fried Bloody Beast is meant to be shared by four people.

A portion of the sales will go to help hunger charities.

'Ten per cent of its sales go to Milwaukee's Hunger Task Force, an organisation fighting hunger and serving those less fortunate in our community,' a bar spokesman said.

The item has been on the menu since 2014.

And this isn't the first time the restaurant has been in the news for its crazy cocktail concoctions.  

In the ongoing quest for world's best burger, owner Dave Sobelman decided that a bacon cheeseburger perched on a Bloody Mary could be it.

The Fully-Loaded, Cheeseburger-Bloody Mary was dreamed up by Mr Sobelman in 2012.  

The drink/burger creation is garnished with a prawn, Polish sausage, cheese, pickled asparagus and sticks of celery and costs $9 (£6).

Mr Sobelman, who started the business with wife Melanie in 1999, previously told MailOnline that he originally came up with combination to get people talking on the pub's Facebook page.

Mr Sobelman said: 'We are known for our Bloody Marys and so I decided to put a slider on the side.'

After more than a decade at the helm, he is an expert in the burger trade and tweaked the Bloody Mary combination to perfect it.

He added: 'I've stopped putting the bacon on it; it was causing the burger to slide down the cocktail stick. 

'The best way is to put a slice of cheese on each side of the burger which sticks everything together.' 

It is not the only bar to experiment with food-filled cocktails though. 

Vancouver bar the Score on Davie sells a Caesar - the Canadian take on a Bloody Mary - that not only features a whole roast chicken, but also a burger, pulled pork Sriracha-glazed slider, onion rings, chicken wings, a pulled pork mac and cheese hotdog and even a brownie.

Their effort is a monstrous 5,000 calories, costs $60 (£40)  and takes 20 minutes to put together. 

in 2012, bar owner Dave Sobelman also created the Fully-Loaded, Cheeseburger-Bloody Mary 

The bar is run by Mr Sobelman, and his wife Melanie. It has been a firm fixture in Wisconsin since 1999
