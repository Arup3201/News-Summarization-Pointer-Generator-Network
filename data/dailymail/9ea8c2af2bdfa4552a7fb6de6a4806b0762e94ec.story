The parents of a schoolgirl who died when she was knocked over in her school playground have called for a nationwide ban on the game of British bulldogs.

Freya James, aged eight, was hurt when a pupil hurled into her playing the rough, tag-based game in her playground.

She fell onto an ornamental feature made from a railway sleeper.

Tragedy: Freya James, eight, died after allegedly bumping into another child in the playground at Trafalgar School in Twickenham, Middlesex

Despite her serious stomach injury, staff at her primary school then made her walk up to six metres to a first aid room, it is claimed.

Freya, who had a ruptured liver, was rushed to hospital after the lunchtime incident in February.

She died two hours later without her family having the chance to say goodbye.

Yesterday her parents Nick and Anekke James, from Twickenham, Middlesex, blamed the fast-moving playground game for her death.

Mr James, 42, said : ‘I hope our daughter’s death will lead to a more widespread ban.’

The businessman, who runs a cabinet making firm, described their daughter as ‘an Angel loved by everybody’ in the days after her death.

Yesterday he said: ‘When you go through the sequence of events, you’ve got a boy running at high speed in a crowded playground and you’ve got a wooden sleeper serving no purpose.

‘Freya was also made to walk five or six metres to a first aid room - despite holding her abdomen when teachers found her on the ground.

‘We need to know if that caused more serious damage. There are a lot of questions that need answering.’

The family claim that staff at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham never apologised nor accepted responsibility.

In a statement in February, the family said: ‘She was a bundle of energy from the time she woke up to the time she went to bed. She was so strong and determined in everything she did and always tried to help those that struggled.

‘Our princess has gone but we know her spirit and her memories will always be with us. Our lives have been absolutely shattered.

‘Our hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly and we are left with scars that will never heal.’

Dean Rogers, chairman of governors at the school, said: ‘This has been a horrendously difficult period for the staff as well as the children at the school. But we still couldn’t possibly comprehend what it has been like for Nick and Anekke.

‘We understand they feel angry and need answers and the inquest will hopefully give them those.

‘Ahead of the hearing, it would be inappropriate to comment further.’

Headmaster Neil Meehan said after the accident: ‘Our thoughts are with the parents and family of the pupil during this very sad time and we are working with educational psychologists to support pupils and staff at the school as necessary.’

Other primary schools have already banned children from playing rough playground games.

In March this year Queensbridge Primary School in Hackney, east London, came under criticism from parents for banning children from playing tag, because the game was ‘too rough’.

Lionel Hives, a father with children at the school, said at the time:‘All the evidence suggests exercise in the playground is an important part of children’s ability to focus on schoolwork for the rest of the day. We should be encouraging exercise, not curtailing it.’

Headteacher Sarah Bailey insisted the ban was needed because children ‘played it too roughly’.

In 2009 Wood End primary school in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, were banned from playing football in the playground.

The school told them: ‘Unfortunately, several pupils have been hit in the face by a football.

‘Therefore, due to health and safety reasons, football will no longer be allowed on the infant playground at break and lunch times due to restricted space.’
