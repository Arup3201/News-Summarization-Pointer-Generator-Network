A-six-year old boy said 'I have done something bad' after he accidentally started a fire with a lighter that killed two teenage sweethearts and a three-year-old.

Rosie Benellick, 17, her boyfriend Andrew Gunn, 18, and her little brother Harvey, all died after the fire in Honiton, Devon, on April 4 last year.

An inquest into their deaths was today told the fire had been started by a young boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, who had alerted Rosie and Harvey's mother, Mizelley Bennellick, 32, to the blaze.

Toddler: Three-year-old Harvey Bennellick also died in the fire at his home in Honiton, Devon

Mrs Bennellick said in a statement read to the hearing at Exeter's County Hall that the child had gone into the room where she and husband Sean were sleeping, and told her: 'I have done something bad'.

'I said "what have you done?",' she said. 'He said "there is a fire".'

Mrs Bennellick and three children fled the four bedroomed council house, while Mr Bennellick tried to rescue the two teenagers and toddler who were still in their upstairs bedroom.

He was beaten back by the intense heat as emergency crews arrived at the house and pulled them from the flames.

Mrs Bennellick, who was outside, said: 'I was screaming, panicking, I was screaming Rosie’s name. They were still in the property.'

Home: Rosie's father Sean had tried to free the teenagers and Harvey from the four-bedroom house

Tributes: Flowers left in memory of Rosie, Andrew and Harvey at the house after the blaze

She told neighbour Carol Ings that her 'babies' were still in the house, and relayed to Detective Constable Clare Ware, who was sent to the scene, what had happened.

'Child D came downstairs and said he had done a really naughty thing,' Mrs Bennellick said in the statement. 

'He said I was playing with a lighter and started a fire. It all felt like a bad dream.

'It is a devastating tragedy for our family, almost impossible to recover from our loses in the fire.'

Rosie, hotel worker Andrew, and Harvey were all airlifted to hospital but the couple died in Exeter the day after the fire, and Harvey the following day at a Bristol hospital.

All three died from ‘inhalation asphyxia’, the inquest was told, and suffered brain injuries from breathing in carbon monoxide and cyanide fumes. Their organs were donated for transplant.

Devon coroner, Dr Elizabeth Earland, said it was a ‘tragic case’ and she imposed a reporting restriction on the three children who survived the blaze - a seven year old girl and boys aged six and five.

The inquest at Exeter’s County Hall heard that Mr Bennellick and teenagers Rosie and Andrew all smoked roll up cigarettes and used disposable lighters.

Mrs Bennellick, who had been due to attend the inquest but had instead been admitted to hospital, said in her statement that the family had strict rules about smoking which included smoking outside or in the kitchen and ‘not to leave lighters lying around’.

The inquest that a year earlier Child D had been caught setting fire to some paper in a garden.

The family said they had three smoke alarms fitted in the house, managed by East Devon Council, but a week before the blaze they all became faulty.

Mr Bennellick, 36, said in his statement Andy and Rosie kept their tobacco and lighters in their bedroom but he had warned them to be careful about younger children picking them up.

He said Rosie had taken the faulty smoke alarms to pieces and left them in a kitchen drawer because they were ‘going off for no reason’ and waking up the younger children at night.

Couple: Rosie and Andrew were both airlifted to hospital in Exeter, but died the following day

He said he had heard Child D say 'I have done something bad', before he ran out, and his wife told him something was happening upstairs. 

'I tried to go forwards, it was so, so hot and realised there was a fire upstairs,' he said. 'The heat was unbearable.'

He said that all the upstairs bedroom windows were shut and he was unable to break them.

'I thought they are burning to death,' he said. 'It was impossible to get through. I could not see anything upstairs, I could not even see the door to the bedroom.'

Mr Bennellick said he had been scared to ask his wife later told him that Child D seemed to have started the fire in a bedroom, but said he was ‘scared to ask him direct questions’ in case the child thought he was angry with him.

Neighbour Carol Ings said she took the three surviving children into her house said Child D was a ‘scared little boy’ who looked like a ‘rabbit in headlights’. 

The inquest was played video recordings of police interviews with a seven-year-old girl and the six-year-old boy following the fire.

The girl said the first time she became aware of the blaze was when the boy told Mr and Mrs Bennellick what was going on.

'He said "someone has been messing with fire and there's fire upstairs",' the girl told police.

'(The boy) was the first one to know about the fire and he got really hot in his cheeks.'

During his interview with police, the boy said he had been playing on a PlayStation in a bedroom when it became hot.

'There was a lighter on the side where the PlayStation was,' he said. 'The PlayStation knocked it off.

'Then the telly fell off and switched it on. Then it started setting a sheet on fire and a bed on fire.'

When asked if the boy knew how to operate the lighter, which he described as orange, he replied: 'There's a little switch on the back of it.

Sean Bennellick, 36, said Andy and Rosie kept their tobacco and lighters in their bedroom but he had warned them to be careful about younger children picking them up

'The telly fell on the switch and then set the bed on fire.'

The boy said he had to jump over fire to escape and went to alert others in the house but 'forgot' to alert Harvey,  Rosie and Andy. 

Paramedic Duncan Pearce said Child D was unhurt and said he made a 'random comment' of 'is little Harvey going to die?'

Mr Pearce said of Mrs Bennellick: 'She was so calm, it was difficult to believe she was the mum.'

He added that her husband  was 'emotional and crying'.

Fire group manager Christopher Blackburn said the smoke alarms had been taken down saying Mr Bennellick had said a week before they had started sounding for no reason and Rosie had taken them apart and removed the batteries.

He said the fire started in a first floor back bedroom.

He said: 'It is my conclusion two fires were started (in a) bedroom using a cigarette lighter. The person who lit those fires left the room and shut the door behind them.'

He said if the smoke and heat detectors had been working it would have been 'exceptionally likely all the occupants would have been alerted at a very early stage' and would have had 'adequate time to escape'.

The fire chief said a fire was started under a folding bed in the bedroom and also in a chest of drawers where two books were found to have been burned, possibly at a different time. One of the books was a Horrid Henry book, he said.

The Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland concluded that Rosie, Andrew and Harvey died after a fire which was accidental but contributed to by 'neglect'.

She said: 'I consider there is insufficient evidence to say that the fire which killed the three was started deliberately.

'I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the fire was caused by an accidental ignition of material by the fold up bed in bedroom A in the early hours of April 5, 2013.

'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the smoke detectors fitted at the property had been intentionally disabled as an unintentional but foreseeable consequence.'

'All three died as a consequence of these circumstances.' 

She said that the tragedy should serve as a warning to people who have smoking materials in their homes where there are young children, but did not consider that the criteria for gross negligence had been met.

She recorded a conclusion of accidental death contributed to by neglect for Rosie, Harvey and Mr Gunn.

'I am prevented from naming individuals, I am also prevented from attributing liability,' she went on.

'Nevertheless, there remains serious concerns that the careless use of smoking materials presents significant dangers within the home.

'Those tasked with looking after young children should be aware of what can happen and take steps to prevent fires from breaking out,' she said.

Dr Earland offered her condolences to the Bennellick family, who did not attend the inquest, and Mr Gunn's parents, who did.

'We hope that in time they might come to terms with the dreadful tragedy,' she said.
