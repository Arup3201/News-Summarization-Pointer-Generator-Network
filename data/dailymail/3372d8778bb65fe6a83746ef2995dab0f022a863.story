Police are refusing to release the audio tape of a 13-minute, 911 call made by a woman who wasÂ  shot dead, allegedly by her husband, while she was still on the phone.

Authorities are investigating whether Denver officers responded quickly enough to the call made by Kristen Kirk, 44, on Monday night at her home just a mile from the police station.

A homicide detective who listened to the 911 call said he could hear her scream and then gunfire, according to court documents. Officers arrived just after the shooting and found Mrs Kirk, a mother of three sons, dead of a gunshot wound to the head.

However, four exchanges between police and dispatchers were released, according to the Denver Post.

Police dispatch alerted two officers about the incident at the Kirk family home at 9.32pm on Monday.

After ten minutes, officers were still en route to the home and reading the dispatcher's notes from Mrs Kirk's conversation on his laptop.

Following Mrs Kirk's screams and a gunshot, the line went silent. The dispatcher then says: 'Code 10' - the alert to a possible shooting.

One of the officers asks the dispatcher to get Mrs Kirk back on the phone to which the dispatcher responds: 'Technically, she's still on the line.'

At 9.47pm, an officer radios from the home to say that they have arrived and three minutes later calls for an ambulance saying there is a victim with gunshot wounds.

He adds: 'We're going to need homicide.'

On Wednesday, a judge ordered her husband, Richard 
Kirk, 47, held without bond after his first court appearance. Kirk wore a grey jail uniform and showed no emotion.

He faces first-degree murder charges and was being represented by a public defender, who declined to comment.

Police
 officials said their internal investigation will focus on the time it 
took for officers to respond to the home and whether dispatchers 
properly prioritized the woman's call, which is characterized in court 
paperwork as a 'domestic disturbance'.

Denver
 police have struggled with slowing response times in recent months as 
the department's ranks have shrunk due to retirements, departures and 
budget cuts.

Kristine
 Kirk told dispatchers that her husband was 'talking about the end of 
the world, and he wanted her to shoot him,' the documents say. She said 
he was hallucinating and scaring the couple's three young boys.

She
 told a call-taker there was a gun in the house but it was in a safe. 
Dispatchers asked her a series of questions about her husband's medical 
history and possible drug use.

Authorities investigate the homicide at the family's Denver home but refused to release Mrs Kirk's 911 call

As the call continued, she said her husband retrieved the weapon and she began to scream, according to the documents. Police said she was shot about 12 to 13 minutes into the call.

Officials have refused to release the 911 call or dispatch records, citing the open investigation.

'Any time a person dies while communicating with Denver's emergency services we examine the circumstances to ensure that the incident was handled properly and we look for areas to improve upon,' Sonny Jackson, a department spokesman, said in a statement.

He also said detectives are investigating whether Richard Kirk used marijuana before the shooting 'based on evidence we found at the scene'.

His father, also Richard Kirk, said the family is shocked, as the couple had shown no signs of marital distress. He visited the family in January and was unaware of any drug use by his son.

'It was a great family,' he said. 'He seemed very happy.'

Kirk said police had not given him any information about how the 911 call was handled.
