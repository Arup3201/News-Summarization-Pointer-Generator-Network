Maria Miller had four au pairs but claimed not one of them could be traced to back up her story.

So close were the au pairs to the Miller family, they would often travel ahead to ‘make sure the house was ready for the children’.

Yet when the expenses watchdog asked for witnesses to the family’s routine, Mrs Miller insisted none of the four girls could be contacted.

She told the standards commissioner: ‘We had four au pairs, all of whom were young girls from abroad (effectively on a gap year, learning or improving their English) and all of whom returned to their homes after their time with us came to an end.

This relates to a period up to seven and a half years ago; they were not family friends and I do not remain in touch with any of them.’

It is unclear what efforts, if any, Mrs Miller made in trying to track down these important witnesses to her case.

But it is understood the names of the four girls were held back from the commissioner who could have made independent inquiries as to their whereabouts.

Mrs Miller had been asked to provide the names and addresses of any witnesses who could back up her claims about the time she spent in each of her homes.

The minister replied that it would be ‘a concern to me if anyone observed my family’s daily movements’, adding: ‘You will be aware of the security issues MPs face.’ In a 2013 exchange of letters, Mrs Miller insisted: ‘I don’t think anyone outside of my family can provide the sort of evidence that you are looking for.’

But when asked if the au pairs might be able to assist, the minister suggested it would be impossible to contact them.

Yet on the basis of her own evidence, the au pairs would appear to have been very much a part of family life in the Miller household.

She said that when she travelled to her constituency at weekends, the au pair would ‘often travel down on Thursday to make sure the house was ready for the children’.

Mrs Miller claimed she spent ‘most’ of her nights at her Basingstoke home, which was ‘the centre of family life’.

But yesterday a neighbour of one of the properties she rented in Basingstoke until around 2008 said: ‘She was only here occasionally - she lived in London and would come here for a meeting every now and again.

It’s hard to tell for certain how often she was there as we don’t keep an eye on our neighbours and we are very spaced out around here. But I’m sure she was only here occasionally.’

A nearby farmer added: ‘She moved in when she was first elected. I met her once - she came up one Easter with her children while I was lambing. She was off-duty though, so we didn’t talk about her job.

But apart from that, she didn’t appear to be there much - though she may have come in nine at night and left at four in the morning.’

Meanwhile in London, a neighbour of her taxpayer-funded ‘second home’ in Wimbledon said: ‘I saw Mrs Miller coming in and out of there frequently, I think it was her main residence but I couldn’t say for sure.

'I’d see her on weekends and sometimes doing the garden. I know her parents lived there, and you’d often see her kids too.’ 

The commissioner ruled that Mrs Miller’s London home should have been designated the ‘main home’ rather than the Basingstoke one.

This was because she had welcomed her parents and brothers to live there, London was where her City lawyer husband worked, and where each of her children in turn went to school.

Mrs Miller and her husband Iain bought the double-fronted Victorian house in Wimbledon for £234,000 in 1996.

But she increased their mortgage several times until it was £575,000 - well over twice the amount they paid for it.

Because it was her ‘second home’, she was able to make taxpayers help fund her mortgage interest payments.In February of this year, she sold the house for £1.47million, banking a profit of £1,236,000.

She used the proceeds to purchase a £1.2million converted barn in Hampshire.
