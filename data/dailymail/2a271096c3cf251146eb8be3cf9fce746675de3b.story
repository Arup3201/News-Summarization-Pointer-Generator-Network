Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic claims he has no issues with manager Manuel Pellegrini as he prepares to join Schalke on loan.

The German club have announced the signing of the Serbia centre-back - subject to a medical - on a temporary deal that could lead to a permanent move.

Nastasic, 21, has fallen out of favour at City under Pellegrini and has not featured since the Community Shield clash against Arsenal on August 10.

That represents a considerable slump in fortunes for Nastasic, having been one of City's players of the season under Roberto Mancini two years ago, but he insists his relationship with Pellegrini was fine.

'No, everything was all right,' said Nastasic, when asked on Sky Sports News HQ about whether there were problems with Pellegrini.

'I think that is the best option for me and I hope everything will be all right.

'It was hard for me. In six months I didn't play one game. I wanted to go because for my career it is best at the moment to play a lot of games.'

Nastasic joined City from Fiorentina in 2012 and became a regular in his first season at the Etihad Stadium.

Calf and knee injuries robbed him of game time last season and he then fell behind Martin Demichelis in the pecking order.

The summer signing of Eliaquim Mangala then limited his opportunities further and Pellegrini has since appeared to view Dedryck Boyata as a better prospect.

He is now set to join Schalke until the end of the season with the Bundesliga club - who, like City, are still in this season's Champions League - revealing they also have a 'purchase option' on the player.

Before joining City, now 21-year-old Nastasic played in Serie A for Fiorentina in Italy between 2011 and 2012

Nastasic said: 'I had a couple of options but, with my agent also, I decided with the club, and Man City, that it was the best option, Schalke.

'At the moment it is a loan and at the end of the season we will see what will happen.'

The move will see Nastasic link up with Schalke's former Chelsea manager Roberto di Matteo.

Nastasic said: 'I already spoke with him and he told me about the club, about the team and I hope we have a good relationship there.'
