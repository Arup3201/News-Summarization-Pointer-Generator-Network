Never-before seen pictures of Fidel Castro have emerged showing a softer side to the 'People's Revolutionary' as he relaxes on fishing trips and embraces women wearing flower garlands.

The Cuban leader is also seen standing alongside Marxist icon Che Guevara as they welcomed Indonesian dictator Suharto off a plane in the late 1950s in the rare photographs.

They were bought for just $20 (£12) at a flea market in Havana more than 20 years ago from Castro's personal photographer, Alberto Korda, who is remembered for his iconic  image of 'Che'.

Never-before seen pictures of Fidel Castro have emerged showing a softer side to the 'People's Revolutionary' as embraces beautiful women while wearing flower garlands

Advertising veteran Ron Telpner, 64, from Toronto kept the rare collection of negatives in his desk drawer until realising the pictures would be worth at least £30,000.

'I bought the negatives from a grey-haired man in flea market on my first trip to Cuba in 1993, but I had no idea what I was buying because the images were so small. 

'He told me he used to be Castro's personal photographer, but I didn't believe him at first,' said Mr Telpner.

'He had a wonderful spirit and I think he was just trying to make some US dollars. They sat in my desk drawer for more than 20 years until one day I was reading the Mail and I saw that other very similar pictures from the same photographer were being sold for $50,000.

'I couldn't believe it, so I had the pictures put on a disc and I went to Sotheby's and a few other auction houses, one of whom said they would sell for $50,000 as well.'

The 30 black and white pictures were mostly taken of the Marxist-Socialist leader between 1957 and 1959 at the height of the Cuban revolution.

He led Cuba for 48 years before falling gravely ill in July 2006 and handing over power to his brother Raúl, who formally became president in January 2008.

Castro is seen on a fishing trip with Guevara shortly after his communist regime overthrew the military dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959 and came to power.

He is seen lying on the floor wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar as he fixes a fishing rod.

The Cuban leader is also seen drinking a glass of coca cola at the opening of the Havana bottling factory in the late 1950s in one of the images.

Wearing full military uniform, Castro is also seen meeting Indonesian dictator Suharto after his plane landed in Cuba.

He is seen standing next to Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, a politician who served as the President of Cuba from 1959 until 1976.

A couple of places away, Guevara can also be seen wearing a beret as he welcomes the group from Indonesia off the plane.

Mr Telpner, who runs advertising agency The Brainstorm Group, made a series of trips to Cuba between 1993 and 1998.

He said the pictures showing how Castro was a 'romantic hero' and a real raconteur when he first came to power.

Castro currently lives in a quiet suburb of western Havana called Jaimanitas, with police permanently blocking the street to his house, which is codenamed Punto Cero (or 'Point Zero') by Cuban intelligence.

His private life is officially a state secret in Cuba and most ordinary Cubans wouldn't even know he has a second wife and five grown-up children.

Despite claims by former staff that he once lived a flashy life of multiple mansions and yachts, his home now is a modest affair - a modern 1950s two-storey, four-bedroom house which he shares with his second wife, Dalia Soto del Valle and their five children.

There has been a deafening silence from Castro since Barack Obama momentously announced the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba earlier this week.

Wearing flower garlands around his neck, the leader met with several women at a party in the late 1950s
