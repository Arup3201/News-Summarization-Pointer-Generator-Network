Roy Keane has revealed his dismay at hearing Abba’s hit record Dancing Queen played in the Sunderland dressing room just before the players headed out for a match. 

Keane makes the claim in his new autobiography, The Second Half, saying he feared it showed he lacked leaders in his team.

And he also explains why he was so disappointed to hear the Swedish quartet’s 1976 hit being played before a match.

Roy Keane was shocked when none of his players objected to Abba (right) as a pre-match music choice

‘It might seem strange but you find out about characters when you look to see who’s in charge of the music,' he said. 

‘A young lad might want to put on the latest sound; an older player might say, “I’m the senior player” and put himself in charge.

‘But I noticed none of the players (at Sunderland) were in charge of the music and this was a concern for me. A member of staff was in charge.

‘I was looking at him thinking, “I hope someone nails him here.” The last song before the players went on to the pitch was Dancing Queen by Abba. 

Keane worried about a lack of leaders in his Sunderland team after the Abba incident 

‘What really worried me was that none of the players – not one – said, ‘Get that s*** off.’

‘They were going out to play a match, men versus men, testosterone levels were high. You’ve got to hit people at pace. F****’ Dancing Queen.

‘It worried me. I didn’t have as many leaders as I thought.’
