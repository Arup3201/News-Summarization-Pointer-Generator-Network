A female babysitter has been jailed for 16 years for helping a known paedophile rape a three-year-old boy in her care.

Claire Semmens, 28, handed the child over to Aaron Hughes, who filmed the attacks on his mobile phone so he could watch them again on his computer.

Hughes, 32, was caught when police checked his computer because they believed he had breached a court order by downloading child pornography.

A court heard officers discovered 
Hughes had filmed himself raping a child on two occasions at Semmens’s 
home while she was babysitting children.

Both attacks were on the same three-year-old boy, who had been drugged to sedate him.

Hughes has now been jailed for life for the horrific attacks.

Prosecutor
 Laurence Jones said: ‘The rapes were carried out at separate times – 
but both were on the same boy and they happened in Semmens’s bedroom.

‘Semmens
 not only supplied the boy but provided a room which enabled Hughes to 
commit the act and film it in a relatively safe haven.’

He
 continued: ‘By her own admission Semmens knew Hughes was a child sex 
offender who was banned from having any contact with children. But she 
was trying to satisfy Hughes’s perversions for young male children.’

Semmens provided a babysitting service at her home but was handing one child over to child rapist Hughes

The court heard Semmens was attracted to Hughes’s gay lover Hamish Morgan and the three had become close friends.

Hughes
 had a previous conviction for raping a six-year-old boy and Semmens 
hoped that by providing children to Hughes it would clear the way for 
her to have a relationship with Mr Morgan.

Mr Jones said: ‘Aaron Hughes had to be kept happy so she would supply him with a young boy.

‘She had the opportunity to do this because she was a babysitter, regularly looking after boys aged between three and six.’

The
 court heard Hughes and Mr Morgan had moved into a flat in Roath, 
Cardiff, next door to where Semmens provided a babysitting service.

But it wasn’t until police raided Hughes’s home that they discovered he was preying on one of the boys in her care.

He told police he sedated the child before raping him.

Mr Jones said: ‘In the video clip you can see the little boy’s eyes are closed.’

The
 court heard police also found naked images of two other boys that 
Semmens was entrusted with, while child pornography was also found on 
her laptop.

Hughes and Semmens disappeared when they realised the images found on their computers would send them to jail.

The
 pair pawned their jewellery and took a train to Gatwick Airport – 
fleeing in such a hurry Semmens’ pet hamsters were left to die of 
starvation. When they were arrested Hughes told  officers he suffered 
from a multiple personality disorder and he was not responsible for 
raping the boy in January 2013.

Yesterday Semmens and Hughes showed no expression in the dock at Cardiff Crown Court.

Describing
 the crimes as ‘genuinely horrendous offences’, Judge Philip Richards 
said: ‘It almost defies belief that any human being would do such a 
thing to such an innocent young child.

‘You
 Semmens made that child available not once but twice to your paedophile
 friend and  permitted him to carry out his vile activities with that 
young child in your bedroom.

‘You knew full well he was a child abuser and the level of breach of trust is probably worse than Hughes.

‘Each of you are going to spend a long time in prison before you see the light of day.’

Semmens,
 of Roath, Cardiff, admitted two charges of causing or inciting a child 
to engage in sexual activity and possessing indecent images.

Hughes,
 also from Roath,  Cardiff, admitted two charges of rape, possessing 
indecent images and breaching the terms of his sex offenders prevention 
order.

He was jailed for life and told he would not be considered for parole until he has served 12 years in prison.

Both were barred from ever working with children and must sign the sex offenders register for life.
