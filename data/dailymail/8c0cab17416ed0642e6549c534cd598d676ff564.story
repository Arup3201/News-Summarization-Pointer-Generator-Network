This is the moment a raging passenger launched a foul-mouthed tirade at a bus driver because he refused to leave a stop early.

The woman, dressed in a black jacket, was filmed by a fellow passenger on the lower deck of the National Express West Midlands bus in Perry Barr, Birmingham.

A shocking video shows how when the driver delayed leaving the stop the woman shouted at him before unleashing the torrent of angry words.

She screamed: ‘Don’t argue with me. I’m not scared of you f*****. Don’t speak to me. You’re supposed to be a man and I don’t expect you to be scared.

‘You argumentative b******, you’re meant to be a bus driver. You’re meant to be a bus driver. Drive the f***** bus before you crash it, b******. You’re not meant to be arguing with the customers.’

The driver tries to calm the woman, by saying: ‘Yeah, yeah, you’re right,’ but this enrages the woman and she escalates her rant, threatening to get him sacked.

She fumes: ‘If your boss found out you’d get the f****** sack. I know you f****** would. Shut your mouth, I can shout as much as I want. Yeah.’

The man filming then gets up and leaves the bus, pausing to sympathise with the beleaguered driver. He says: ‘Just don’t say nothing bruv [sic], just leave it bruv.’

The driver then shows the man his timetable and says: ‘I’ve got to go by the times on there.'  He then adds: ‘What’s wrong with her? She had a bad day or something?’

After the video was posted to YouTube shocked commenters blasted the unnamed woman. Fliss Powell wrote: ‘I find it disgusting that anyone, let alone a woman, can act like this.

‘We all get frustrated at things in this day and age - but she was acting appallingly. I think the bus driver however should of said his piece then ignored her... stupid woman.’

Andrew Eves added: ‘In the good old days the passenger would have been escorted off the bus.

‘How do I know? My father was a bus driver for over 40 years with BCT [Birmingham City Transport]. No-one has to put up with such utter c*** - neither the driver nor other passengers.’

A National Express West Midlands spokesman said: ‘The customer in question was upset because the bus had stopped at a timing point as the service was running early and spoke to the driver in a clearly unacceptable way.

‘We give our drivers conflict resolution training so they are well equipped to deal with these situations. Our driver handled himself well in this situation and showed a great deal of professionalism.’
