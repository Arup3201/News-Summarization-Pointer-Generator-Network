An Aston Martin sports car used by Prince Charles for 14 years is set to fetch up to £70,000 at auction.

The 1994 Virage Volante 6.3-litre convertible is going under the hammer at auctioneers Bonhams on May 19.

Described by Fast Lane magazine as the 'most aristocratic of convertibles', the soft-top has attracted a pre-sale estimate of between £50,000 and £70,000.

Luxury: The 6.3-litre soft-top, used by the Prince of Wales for 14 years, will be going under the hammer at Bonhams in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on May 19

The model debuted at the 1990 Birmingham Motor Show as a two-seater, but the four-seater was unveiled a year later at the Geneva Motor Show.

This one was owned from new by Aston Martin Lagonda before being used by Prince Charles until 2007/08.

Since then, it has been on display at Aston Martin’s Headquarters at Gaydon, Warwickshire.

Renowned for his love of Aston Martins, Prince Charles is best known for owning an Aston Martin DB6 MKII, given to him by the Queen for his 21st birthday.

Green machine: The DB6 MKII was converted four years ago to run on bio-ethanol fuel distilled from surplus British wine

It received worldwide attention last year when it was used by Prince William and his new wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, to drive out of Buckingham Palace after the Royal Wedding.

The arrival of the Aston Martin Virage Volante at Aston Martin’s Headquarters four years ago coincided with the company’s project to convert Prince Charles’ DB6 MKII to run on bio-ethanol fuel distilled from surplus British wine.

The heir to the British throne is such an avid collector of Aston Martins that several 'Prince of Wales' editions have been unveiled through the years.
