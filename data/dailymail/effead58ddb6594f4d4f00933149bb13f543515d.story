Adam Lallana knows it is 'all-or-nothing' time for England and is confident of kick-starting their World Cup campaign against Uruguay.

Roy Hodgson's side earned many plaudits for the manner in which they excited and enthralled against Italy, yet Saturday's match ended in a frustrating 2-1 loss.

Defeat to the four-time champions is no disgrace but leaves England needing a positive result against Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday.

Let's go! Adam Lallana is confident of kick-starting England's World Cup campaign with a win against Uruguay

Looking forward: Roy Hodgson knows England realistically need something from the game in order to progress

Oscar Tabarez's side are in the same boat after suffering an embarrassing 3-1 loss to Costa Rica, meaning defeat would all-but end either sides' hopes of making it out of Group D.

'It's massive for us,' England midfielder Lallana said. 'We have to go all-out, but we know we need the win and we're confident.

'There were signs the other night that we're close and the lads know that it's all-or-nothing really.

'We've got great confidence in the camp and I'm certainly confident that we're going to get the win.

'We knew from the start that we'd be in a tough group and the Uruguayans are a tough team, but we're a strong team and we've got a great group of players.

'With just a few tweaks we can get this result.'

Those adaptations were worked on during a closed training session at England's Rio de Janeiro training base on Tuesday.

That's better! Wayne Rooney is expected to play in a more central role against Uruguay on Thursday

It appears those changes will see Wayne Rooney return to his favoured number 10 role against Uruguay, with Danny Welbeck playing on the left and Raheem Sterling wide right.

'Roy's had a day with the whole squad, working on a few things that he wanted to get across to the group, but as I said there were positive signs,' Lallana, likely to start from the bench again, said.

'We know we need to improve on the result, definitely, and on the performance if we can.

'If our performance is up there like it was the other night - and if we maybe work defensively on a couple of issues - then we're certainly confident of getting the three points.'

Watching brief: Lallana is expected to start the game on the bench and come on as it progresses

In-form Daniel Sturridge completes England's exciting attacking quintet and, with more exciting talent waiting in the wings, Lallana believes they will soon defeat a top side.

'People have been talking about our creative play but I think it's maybe about that final pass, final cross or final finish,' the Southampton captain added.

'You can see that it's there but it's just about getting it over the line. One of these days we're going to put three or four past a top team.

'I see it in training, I see it in games, we just need that rub of the green and extra bit of confidence and then I think we will get that result.'
