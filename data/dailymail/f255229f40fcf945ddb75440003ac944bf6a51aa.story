It seems that 2014 was a very, very good year to be Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav.

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Friday, it was revealed that Zaslav was compensated an unbelievable $156.1million last year.  

This amount, thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week, shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and his running of networks like OWN, makes him one of the highest paid television executives.

Discovery has also done well thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week

Variety reports that a large portion of that money comes from stocks, with Zaslav receiving $144million in awards for his six-year contract.

1.Sumner Redstone (CBS, Viacom) - $93.4m

2.Les Moonves (CBS) - $66.9m 

3.Philippe Dauman (Viacom) - $37.2m 

4.Bob Iger (Disney) - $34.3m 

5.David Zaslav (Discovery) - $33.3m 

6.Jeffrey Bewkes (Time Warner) - $32.5m

7.Brian Roberts (Comcast) - $31.4m 

8.Stephen Burke (NBC) - $31.1m

9.Chris Albrecht (Starz) - $30.5m 

10.Thomas Dooley (Viacom) - $29.1m 

It is a remarkable boost from the $33million he received in 2013, with $22.5million of that also coming from stock awards.

The amount seems to be deserved as well, as under Zaslav's guidance, the company's market cap has grown from $5billion in 2007 to $20billion today.

As for his base salary, that was $3million, where it will stay for the length of his contract, and he can no receive a cash bonus greater than $6.6million until the last two years of his new contract, when that amount goes to $9million.

This amount is far, far greater than the two television executives who made the most last year, Sumer Redstone and Les Moonves.

Redstone, who heads up CBS and Viacomn, took home $93.4million, while Moonves, the CEO of CBS, took home $66.9million.

'This contract rewards Mr. Zaslav for the value he has created and the continued strategic direction he provides and requires sustained performance over time for that award to have value,' the filing states.

'At the end of his contract, Mr. Zaslav will own a substantial amount of equity of Discovery, which reinforces his alignment with our shareholders and encourages long-term ownership of our stock.' 

This amount is far, far greater than the $93million CBS chairman Sumner Redstone (left) made in 2013 and the $67m Les Moonves (right) made

Zaslav is also likely to become the biggest shareholder at Discovery under this new contract is he buys the shares of television mogul John Malone who also holds a sizable stake in the company.

He will have right of first refusal to purchase Malone's stocks should he sell. 

The contract will expire in 2019.
