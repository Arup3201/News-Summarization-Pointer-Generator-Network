Miranda Lambert had a scare last night when her private jet was forced to make an emergency landing at an airport in West Virginia. 

The country star was in the middle of a hectic week and was flying from New York to Nashville when the plane lost pressure and was forced to divert to the town of Clarksburg.

Ms. Lambert took to Instagram to tell her her fans what had happened.

Platinum! Miranda Lambert and her team playing around with some of the firefighters hazmat suits after her plane made an emergency landing at an airport in West Virginia. The cause remains unknown

'Our plane had an emergency landing in Clarksburg WV. But don't worry, we found platinum fire suits,' she wrote. Platinum being the name of her latest album which came out yesterday.

Killing time while the problem with the plane was sorted, Lambert and her crew hung out with airport firefighters while trying on their shiny hazmat suits.

The Westwind twin jet departed Teterboro, NJ, just outside New York City on Tuesday afternoon with a plan to land at Nashville International Airport.

She spent about three hours on the ground before the group resumed their journey southward towards Music City.

Star appeal: The country singer had given an interview at Good Morning America in New York City earlier in the day

'The plane that they were on lost cabin pressure,' according to Scott Poling, a lineman at the airport who spoke to Metro News. 'We don’t know why. They landed here safely with no problems and hung out for about two hours. A Learjet was  sent up here from Nashville to pick them back up.'

'She’s super down-to-earth, doesn’t act like a celebrity, a country girl,' Mr Poling said.

'They put on our fire suits inside here to promote their new album ‘Platinum,’ which I have pictures of. She autographed a couple of CDs for me and my buddies here. It was pretty cool.'

'She was really happy. She thanked us several times,' said Mr Poling.

'Her staff thanked us several times for what we did for them here and they sat back, had a good time, relaxed and waited until the jet arrived and said it was  beautiful here in West Virginia.'

Pioneer: Miranda Lambert is on the cover of this months' Rolling Stone Magazine - its first country issue

At least 30 people showed up to the airport to try and catch a glimpse of the star after posting on Instagram.

Ms. Lambert had just appeared on Good Morning America to promote her new album and the fact she is on the front cover of Rolling Stone magazine with rocker Eric Church.

Things will only get busier for Ms. Lambert now that she's back in Nashville.

She's in the midst of launching her fifth album and started the week with a series of appearances in New York.

She'll be performing at the CMT Music Awards later today with Carrie Underwood, teaming up with Shelton on Friday at the CMA Music Festival and then traveling Saturday to Dallas to help George Strait with his final concert.
