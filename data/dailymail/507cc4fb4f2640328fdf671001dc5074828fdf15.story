Most of us hope to see out our twilight years in a little luxury.

And that's exactly what Twiglet the Shetland pony is doing after his owner decided to give him free run of the flowerbeds and luscious lawns of Forde Abbey, near Chard in Somerset.

The 46-year-old animal - who is thought to be the oldest Shetland pony in Britain - was feared to be on his last legs before his owner Alice Kennard decided to let him to stretch his legs in the grounds of the historic former monastery.

Veteran: Twiglet (pictured here in the grounds of Forde Abbey, Somerset, with owner Alice Kennard's seven-year-old daughter Marcia) could be the oldest Shetland pony in Britain

Loved: The pony (pictured here being ridden by Marcia and led by four-year-old Amelie, right) was born in 1966 - the year England won the football World Cup. He has been used to teach dozens of children to ride since then

Loved: Twiglet has become a popular figure with visitors to Forde Abbey, in Somerset (pictured here again with Amelie, left, and Marcia, right)

Twiglet, who was born in 1966 - the year England won the football World Cup - has rallied after being given the run of 
the estate.

The 46-year-old - who is way past the average life expectancy for his breed - was literally wasting away as age took its toll and was losing weight so fast owner Mrs
Kennard feared he would not live to see another autumn.

But the pony has flourished since Ms Kennard decided to allow him to feast on the lush grass and choice border 
flowers in the Abbey's grounds and gardens.

Thriving: The pony (again pictured here with Amelie, front, and Marcia, riding him) has flourished since his owners allowed him to roam free in the Abbey's grounds

Since making a recovery and putting back on the lost pounds he has become a firm favourite with visitors to the 12th Century monastery which was once lived in by monks.

Mrs Kennard, whose family have owned the estate for the last 70 years, said: 'We pride ourselves on our gardens and normally they would be sacrosanct but we had to do something for Twiglet.

'We felt a few hoof prints on the grass or a few nibbled plants would be worth it for his sake,' she said.

'He’s been such a big part of our lives since we took him in when his former owner died.'

Mrs Kennard said all of her children have learned to ride on Twiglet who she said is 'gorgeous, like a big dog really.'

'At first, we had some well meaning visitors who kept reporting there was an escaped pony in the gardens,' she said.

'We reassured them he had deliberately been turned out and why.

'Now, we’ve attached a little notice to a tree stump explaining who he is, how old he is and why he is there.'

Mrs Kennard said Twiglet had proved very popular and that people have come back to visit the Abbey and check on his progress.

'I
knew he wouldn’t be able to escape or at least not get far if he did 
because he had severe laminitis a few years ago and it’s agonising for 
him to put his feet onto the hard drive or road,' she said.

'Grass is just the thing.'

New life: Twiglet, pictured here being fed by Amelie, was losing weight before being allowed to stretch his legs in the Abbey's grounds

Affection: The Kennards say that sacrificing the odd flowerbed for Twiglet's happiness has been well worth it (Marcia Kennard is pictured hugging Twiglet in front of the Abbey)

Mrs Kennard said the family do not fence Twiglet in, allowing him instead to wander 
at will.

'Sometimes there is the odd pile of something for us to clear up,' she said,
' but it’s a small price to pay and we put it on the flower beds.

'The roses looked particularly good this year.'

Dressing up: Twiglet is dressed for battle at a fancy dress competition. He is seen here being ridden by Sam Kennard, 10, and with Sam's father Julian Kennard (right)
