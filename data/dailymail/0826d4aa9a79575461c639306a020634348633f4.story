An expedition to bring back the remaining gold from a steamship that sank in 1857 off South Carolina in one of the nation's worst maritime disasters has recovered almost 1,000 ounces of gold - the first gold recovered from the wreck in almost a quarter century.

The S.S. Central America was bringing gold back from the California when it sank in a hurricane claiming 425 lives. In addition, thousands of pounds of gold went to the bottom aboard the 280-foot, side-wheel steamship.

About $50 million was recovered during expeditions to the wreck in the late 1980s and early 1990s before legal disputes shut down the operation.

Odyssey Marine Exploration of Tampa, Florida, announced Monday that almost 1,000 ounces of the gold was recovered during a reconnaissance dive last month.

Odyssey announced on Monday, May 5, 2014, that the bars are among nearly 1,000 ounces of gold that has been initially recovered from the wreck of the ship that sank during a hurricane in 1857. An earlier expedition a quarter-century ago recovered gold bars and coins worth about $50 million at that time

Worth a fortune: These gold bars were salvaged during Odyssey's first reconnaissance dive to the SS Central America shipwreck site, which lies 2,200 meters deep and 160 miles off the coast of South Carolina

The newly recovered gold includes five gold bars and two $20 Double Eagle gold coins. One of the coins was minted in San Francisco the year that the Central America sank. The gold bars weigh between 106 and 344 ounces.

'While we weren't planning to recover gold so quickly, it did confirm that the site has not been disturbed since it was last visited in 1991 and there is gold remaining,' said Mark Gordon, Odyssey's president and chief operating officer.

An expedition that left North Charleston in April is expected to be on the site about 160 miles off the coast until late summer.

Gordon said that in recent weeks the crew of 41 aboard the Odyssey Explorer has been conducting an extensive survey of the site and the recovery of more gold will begin once that is completed.

It is not clear how much gold might remain. The ship was carrying gold bars shipped by banks and commercial interests. Passengers were thought to be carrying a lot of gold of their own in the form of coins — perhaps an amount equaling the commercial shipment.

The initial expeditions 25 years ago were halted because of legal disputes.

One of 
them involved investors from Ohio who staked out the money for shipwreck
 enthusiast Tommy Thompson, an Ohio native, who led the 1988 expedition 
that recovered the initial cache of gold.

The
 investors claimed they had fronted Thompson almost $13 million but 
never saw any return. Thompson has been a fugitive for almost two years 
after failing to show up for a court hearing.

A deal approved by an Ohio judge in March cleared the way for the new expedition.

The
 receiver for Thompson's companies will get more than half of anything 
that is recovered, to be disbursed in part to the investors who backed 
the initial expedition.

The
 work to recover the gold follows a long court battle over treasure 
salvaged from the shipwreck in the late 1980s by a pioneering young 
engineer whose efforts were detailed in the 1998 bestselling book, Ship 
of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea.

The
 85-metre-long sidewheel steamship carried as much as 19 tonnes of gold 
ingots, freshly minted gold coins and raw gold from the California 
mines, as well as the personal wealth and belongings of its 477 
passengers, most of whom were lost when the ship sank in September 1857.

The ship's gold was initially valued at $760,000 US in 1857 but is worth millions of dollars today, according to Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc, a Florida-based company which won the contract to revisit the shipwreck.

'There's no doubt in our minds that there's going to be an economic return,' Mark Gordon, the company's president and chief operating officer, said on Monday.

Gold recovered from the ship by a team led by Ohio engineer Tommy Thompson, which discovered the Central America using sonar and robotic technology he developed, became the focus of an extended legal fight over rights to the treasure and return for investors. Thompson has been a fugitive since 2012 when he failed to appear in court.

Last year, a court in Ohio appointed a receiver who will distribute some of the profits from further exploration to the former investors. In March, the receiver awarded Odyssey the contract to revisit the shipwreck, which lies over 257 kilometres offshore and about 2.2 kilometers below the surface.

'We know that the wreck was only partially excavated, only about five per cent of the site,' Gordon said.

The
 company's research vessel, Odyssey Explorer, sailed from Charleston, 
South Carolina, last week with 41 crew members for a project he 
estimated will cost between $5 and $10 million.

The
 Central America steamship ran between Panama and New York, carrying 
prospectors and their fortunes made in the California Gold Rush. On its 
last trip, it held tons of commercial gold valued at about $93,000 in 
1857 and passenger gold valued at up to $1.2 million, court experts 
estimated.

Historians
 say the ship's sinking triggered a New York banking panic that was part
 of a larger U.S. financial crisis known as the Panic of 1857.

U.S. $20 Double Eagle gold coins fetch $5,000 apiece on average from collectors, he said.

The market price for pure gold bullion Monday was around $1,309 per troy ounce.

Bob Evans, of Recovery Limited Partnership, the court-appointed receiver that hired Odyssey, told Bloomberg there may be up to $86 million of gold still lying on the ship.

Researchers will remain on site for up to five months, rotating crew around the clock and making occasional port calls on Charleston, South Carolina, Gordon said. The company expects to report in about 60 days what the wreck might yield.
