This is the moment a builder was crushed under 15 tonnes of rubble as he demolished a garage.

Father-of-two Jake Weir, 33, of Spalding, Lincolnshire, was knocking down the building to make way for an extension when the garage roof suddenly collapsed and the supporting wall fell on top of him.

The shocking accident was filmed by the homeowner as Mr Weir was buried under tonnes of bricks. He was dug out of the wreckage and taken to hospital with his left leg hanging from a strand of skin.

The former paratrooper underwent a six-hour operation after the horror accident last June, which saw surgeons drill metal pins into the ligaments and tendons in his shredded limb.

Mr Weir was taken to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre after the accident, where doctors told him he would probably need his leg amputated - but one year on, he is amazingly now back at work.

He said: ‘I remember the wall exploding and hitting me in the face. I was still conscious and I looked up and thought I've got to get out of here. Honestly, I thought I was gone, I thought that was it.

‘I thought I was going to die, but when I saw the dust settle on the bricks and realised I was still alive my adrenaline kicked in and I started to drag myself out of the mess.

‘I pulled myself from the rubble and 
looked down to see my legs in knots. I couldn't feel any pain though - 
it was a strange sensation, I was just numb. My leg was hanging off 
basically.

'Honestly, I thought I was gone, I thought that was it. I thought I was going to die'

Jake Weir

‘It was 
certainly a wake-up call which makes you put your life in perspective. I
don't watch the video any more.

'Psychologically I've had to deal with 
what happened to me and it's taken some time. I used to get flashbacks, but I'm thankful I can now see the funny side. I'm just so thankful I'm alive.’

Mr Weir lives with his his wife, Amanda-Jane Weir, 40, a NHS manager, and their son Morgan, seven.

He added: ‘It's a job which I'd done before, and when you are demolishing things often people want to take pictures or videos of the moment. That's how my accident came to be caught on video.’

Professor Chris Moran, who has been a consultant at the Queen's Medical Centre for 20 years, said Mr Weir's injuries were like to those often seen by high-speed motorbike crashes.

'In the immediate aftermath of the accident medics told him his chances of retaining his injured leg were slim'

Professor Chris Moran

He added: ‘When I first saw him, his type of injury was as severe as it could be, without having to be amputated. I've never known someone recover as quickly from such an injury as Jake.

‘He has worked very hard at his recovery and deserves a lot of credit for that.

‘His injuries were too severe for hospitals in Lincolnshire to handle, and in the immediate aftermath of the accident medics told him his chances of retaining his injured leg were slim.’
