A former child star has filed a lawsuit against Vogue over the music used on a behind-the-scenes video for its Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover shoot.

Ohio-based Ricky Spicer, 56, who was the 12-year-old lead singer of Seventies soul group The Ponderosa Twins Plus One, claims that the glossy magazine used West's Bound 2 track that contains unauthorized samples of his voice.

His Manhattan civil suit, obtained by the New York Post, says: 'Mr Spicer’s voice is used substantially 
throughout the video, comprising approximately 44 per cent of the 
lyrics.'

The suit, which is seeking unspecified compensation, claims that Vogue 'knowingly used the voice audio recording of Mr Spicer without his authorization or consent.'

Spicer has already filed a lawsuit against West, Roc-A-Fella Records, Island Def-Jam Music, Rhino Entertainment and Universal Music Group over the Bound 2 track.

The suit, filed at the Manhattan Supreme Court in December last year, claims that West 'stole' a sample of his voice from his Seventies track, Bound.

It said: 'Mr Spicer’s voice is sampled exactly
 as he recorded it and his voice … is heard several times.'

Spicer claims that he never granted West or anyone associated with him permission to use his voice.

He added that he was stunned when he heard himself on Bound 2, the
 second single from West's Yeezus album that debuted at the top of the 
Billboard 200 chart in June 2013.

Vogue's behind-the-scenes video shows Kardashian and West on set with their baby daughter North, posing for top photographer Annie Leibovitz.

It accompanied one of the title's most controversial covers, which saw Kardashian and West posing together ahead of their wedding later this year.

The decision to put them on the cover 
sparked a backlash from readers, with some critics claiming that they 
feld 'betrayed' by the magazine.

But Anna Wintour, the magazine's editor-in-chief, defended her choice and also put an end to rumors that West had been 'begging' her to put Kardashian on the cover of Vogue.

She wrote in her Editor's Letter: 'You may have read that Kanye begged me 
to put his fiancée on Vogue’s cover. He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better 
reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true.'

What's more, it seems her choice is proving to be a wise one as the issue is flying off newsstands.

According to the New York Post, the controversial April issue is set to 
sell around 400,000 copies. Comparatively, Beyonce's cover sold more 
than 355,000 copies and Michelle Obama's cover sold nearly 300,000.

A spokesperson for Vogue did not immediately reply to MailOnline's request for comment.
