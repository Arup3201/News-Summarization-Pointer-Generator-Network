Charlie Sheen has penned a bizarre ode to his 'hero' Brian Williams, offering him his support - and a place to stay.

The beleaguered newscaster has been suspended from NBC for six months without pay after falsely claiming that he was in a helicopter that was shot at during the Iraq War in 2003.

In a lengthy poem shared to Twitter on Wednesday night, Sheen, who was booted off CBS' Two and a Half Men for his own controversial behavior in 2011, thanked Williams for his '24 years of inimitable professionalism'.

'Dear Mr. Williams,' he wrote. 'Sorry to bother you during this most surreal, unjust and mercurial moment in your awesome life.

'First off, THANK YOU, for 24 years of inimitable professionalism and top shelf brilliance, as a stone cold passion driven and (PERFECTLY) fact based journalist.'

He also thanked him for his 'NOBLE sacrifices that made our longest nights shorter'.

'You good sir, are a hero in my Entire Library,' he wrote

In the poem, Sheen added that Williams was 'clearly the victim of a transparent and vile witch hunt' carried out by 'cowards' who were intent on trashing 'the genius they relied on for almost 3 decades!'

He concluded by offering Williams refuge - 'if you need it!' - before signing off 'the MaSheen'.

It is unknown if Williams has taken up Sheen on his offer.  

Williams, 55, was removed from the Nightly News after soldiers accused him of falsely claiming in a news report two weeks ago that he had been aboard a Chinook that was forced to land in Iraq.

In fact, he had been on another aircraft more than half an hour behind the one that was forced to land. It emerged that his story about the incident had changed over the past decade.

Lester Holt, who has stepped into Williams' role on the Nightly News, directly addressed the controversy in Wednesday night's broadcast.

'We will work every night to be worthy of your trust,' he assured the audience.

In a statement, NBC's chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News.

'His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.

'I know Brian loves his country, NBC News, and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone’s trust.'

His removal for the next six months means he has effectively been fined $5 million. He has not commented publicly about the punishment.
