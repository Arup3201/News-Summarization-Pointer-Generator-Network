A heartbroken woman is believed to have hanged herself after her parents died just days apart, her family have revealed. 

Cassie Richardson, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, had struggled for four years following the death of her parents Tony and Janice in April, 2010.

The young mother - who has a 17-year-old daughter Sophie - was said to have been found hanged at the seafront on December 28, in Thornton Cleveleys, and her funeral is due to take place today.

Ms Richardson, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, suffered with depression for four years following the death of her parents Tony and Janice (pictured) in April, 2010

Ms Richardson's mother was diagnosed with cancer in March, 2010, and just one week later she passed away from pneumonia. Then, just one day after her mother's funeral, her father suffered a massive internal bleed

Now her family have urged those suffering with depression to seek help. 

Her brother John, 40, said: 'I urge anybody struggling with the loss of a loved one to reach out and ask for help.

'Whether it is a family member, a friend or an organization or bereavement service - please don't suffer in silence.

'My little sister decided enough was enough and left us behind to be reunited with our parents, aged only 34, and the loss of Cassie left a huge void in our lives.

'But my hope is that somebody reading this will think twice before harming themselves and in turn those around the that love them dearly.'

Her family said that the 34-year-old had struggled to come to terms with losing both of her parents in close succession.

Then, just one day after her mother's funeral, her father suffered a massive internal bleed and was found dead on the floor of his bedroom.

Mr Richardson said: 'When mum passed away just one week after she had been diagnosed with cancer, it left us all in a state of shock.

'And making all the necessary arrangements and informing relatives left us with no time for grief - we hoped that after the funeral would slow and we could take time as a family to come to terms with our loss.

'But just 11 days after our mum's passing and one day after her funeral our dad passed away suddenly and unexpectedly at home from what i now believe to be a broken heart.

'The pain we suffered as a family is unimaginable and the years after were an immense struggle for all of us - especially my dear little sister Cassie, the baby of the family.

'The grief she suffered had finally broken her heart beyond repair.'

Ms Richardson left behind daughter Sophie, 17, long-term partner Tommy, brother John and three sisters - Samantha, Becky and Jane.
