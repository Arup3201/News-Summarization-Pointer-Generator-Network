Villagers have complained after a Christmas tree made from scaffolding and tinsel was constructed on their green.

Residents branded the tree an 'eyesore' after it was erected next to the main road in the Cambridgeshire village of Haddenham.

The tree has been put together using metal scaffolding poles, with tinsel twisted around the structure to form star-shaped branches.

Matthew Hannigan, 52, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw the Christmas tree, it's a real eyesore right in the centre of the village.

'I don't understand why other villages have real Christmas trees with lights and yet our tree is constructed out of metal and tinsel, it's really disappointing.

'It's on the main road through the village so everyone who drives through will see it and wonder why it's not real.'

But resident Miranda Pratt, who helped to construct the tree, said it was meant to be 'conceptual' and 'exciting.'

She said: 'It was put up for our Festival of Light event to celebrate the start of Christmas which we had in our village at the weekend and was attended by more than 1,000 people.

'We wanted to create a Christmas tree which was conceptual and exciting and I think it's wonderful.

'It has 24 stars to represent the days of advent and it is part of our Living Advent Calendar which will see different events around the village to raise money for charity.

'There is a traditional Christmas tree with lights opposite in the church.'
