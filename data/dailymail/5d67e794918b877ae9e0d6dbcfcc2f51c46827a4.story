Pimp: Sorient Sigba made a total of £239,756 from 'Freddy's', but will pay back just £13,017.09

A seconday school teacher who ran an upmarket City of London brothel that raked in £1million a year has been ordered to repay a tiny fraction of his profits.

Father-of-four Sorient Sigba, 54, worked at the Geoffrey Chaucer School in Elephant and Castle during the day while he was operating  'Freddy's' from a three-bedroomed mews house in the City - raking in a personal profit of £239,756.

Despite charging 'tricks' up to £5,000 for a night, he was told to pay back just £13,017.09 following a proceeds of crime hearing at Southwark Crown Court.

Sigba, also known as Freddy, ran the den with Simon Earl, 58 and brothel manager Vera Fosuhene, 47 - known to her clients as Angelina.

Earl
 made £565,131.33 from sex workers at Freddy's and was ordered to hand 
back £103,592 or serve two more years on top of his two-year sentence.

Wine
 broker Michael Wallen, 50, who helped launder the dirty money, must pay
 £83,241.20 from the £391,019.07 he made or serve 20 months on top of 
his jail term of two years and five months.

Customers were chauffeur driven to the
 sex den from outside City strip clubs to romp with girls who encouraged
 them to take as much cocaine as possible to 'make the sex better'.

Cash-paying
 customers were charged £300 an hour, £390 if they preferred to use a 
credit card on arrival and £60 for a wrap of cocaine.

Freddy's
 was opened at the leasehold property in 2006 and in just nine months 
before the ring was smashed by police, its turnover was a staggering 
£946,776.

In a text message 
to Sigba one customer wrote: 'I'm in the mood for a total f*** fest. 
Having two girls who f*** like rabbits to get me in the mood would be 
good.'

An investigation by 
the Metropolitan Police's Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command
 led to undercover officers making three visits to the brothel before 
swooping in October 2010.

Police known only as 'John' and 'Alex' visited the haunt after being 
approached by mini-cab drivers outside the City Burlesque club, in 
Farringdon.

Hidden: 35 John's Mews. London, which housed the upmarket bordello 'Freddy's', frequented by City bankers

During the first
 visit in July 2011 the door to the brothel was opened by Fosuhene and 
inside were five scantily clad girls aged between 20 and 25.

During
 a second visit in October 2011 a Jaguar, later found to be registered 
to Sigba, was parked outside the property and Sigba opened the door to 
the brothel.

Inside the driver who brought the officer told Fosuhene he was 'looking for a real good party.'

When
 officers arrested Sigba at his office in Hatton Garden they found a 
hire purchase agreement for a Jaguar seen outside the mews house.

If he defaults, Sigba will serve another eight months on top of his three year jail sentence.

Fosuhene had narrowly avoided jail after admitting managing a brothel and two counts of supplying cocaine.

She has not been ordered to repay anything as she was only being paid £50 a day, picking girls for the clients.

Fined: Both Vera Fosuhene (left) and Michael Wallen (right) admitted to the charges against them

A judge sentenced her to nine months in prison suspended for two years, and ordered her to complete a six month drug rehabilitation and supervision order to tackle her cocaine addiction.

Sigba, of Barnehurst, Kent, was convicted of conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and conspiracy to transfer criminal property

Earl, of Chislehurst, Kent, pleaded guilty to both charges.

Wallen, of Hackney, east London, admitted conspiracy to transfer criminal property.

Foshuene, of Croydon, Surrey, pleaded guilty to managing a brothel used for prostitution and two counts of supplying cocaine.

Sigba has 28 days to pay or face an additional eight months imprisonment.

Both Wallen and Earl have six months to pay up.
