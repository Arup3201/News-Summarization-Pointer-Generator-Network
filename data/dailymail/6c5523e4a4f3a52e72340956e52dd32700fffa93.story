Residents in a Boston suburb were stunned recently when they opened their sewer bills to find that they owe astronomical amounts - some as high as $55,000 - that will take them decades to pay off.

Initially many people assumed that there had been a clerical error, but now they have been forced to come to terms with the grim reality that under the terms of their property contracts they are liable.

The problem impacts about three dozen homeowners and just as many businesses who are part of a development on Route 20 in Wayland known as Town Center. 

Wayland resident Mary Farley has been hit with a $55,000 sewer bill because they have to pay to use a $5.5 million waste water treatment facility

Residents in the Boston suburb of Wayland were stunned recently when they opened their sewer bills to find that they owe astronomical amounts that will take them decades to pay off

Part of the complex of stores and modern condominiums is a $5.5 million waste water treatment facility.

It was built on an ‘enterprise zone’ which means that only those people hooked up to it must pay all the associated costs.

‘When you add up all the fees, we are looking at close to $55,000,’ Wayland resident Mary Farley told WBZ4.

Another resident, Abhilash Barot, has been told he owes $23,000.

The vast majority of homeowners in Wayland have individual septic systems and therefore only 75 uses have to pay the costs of the expensive new sewer system

All the people impacted claim that nether the developer nor the town ever explained that they would be subject to such huge bills.

The developer claims that if owner's read the legal documents they signed when they purchased their homes it would explain that they are liable.

Most residents say that if the 'hidden costs' had been explained they simply would never have bought the properties.

The vast majority of homeowners in Wayland have individual septic systems and therefore don't use the expensive new sewer system. As a result the entire cost for the facility falls to about 75 users.

One of those business owners hit with the huge costs is Jonathan Buchman, who believes that all residents in the town should share the cost because they use many of the amenities hooked up to the expensive system.

Wayland resident Abhilash Barot owes $23,000 and says he wouldn't have bought his property if the hidden costs had been explained to him

Most of the impacted residents say they wouldn¿t have bought their homes if they'd known about the huge bills they would be hit with

‘Their building, their police station, their fire station is on the system. The main town hall with all the offices is on the system,’ he said.

Town leaders are looking for a solution according to Wayland's interim Town Administrator.

'Hopefully we will take some action that will provide some relief. I don’t know in what form, but some relief to those rate payers,' said Robert Mercier.

The impacted residents have until July to pay their huge bills.
