The FA have announced that it had fined Aston Villa £30,000 for failing to control their players in the wake of Gabriel Agbonlahor's dismissal against Manchester United.

A number of Villa players remonstrated with referee Lee Mason after the Villa forward was deemed the guilty party in what appeared to be a fair challenge for the ball between him and United's ex-Villa winger Ashley Young.

The FA said Villa had also been warned as to their future conduct. 

Gabriel Agbonlahor was shown a red card against Manchester United but his ban has since been overturned 

Ashley Young lies on the turf, but later told keeper Brad Guzan he expected the foul to be awarded Villa's way

Agbonlahor was sent off for using ‘excessive force’ in this challenge with Young in Aston Villa's 1-1 draw 

Agbonlahor had recently seen the red card rescinded by the FA after an appeal by Paul Lambert's side. 

The Villa forward was sent off for using ‘excessive force’ in a challenge with Ashley Young but the United player later told Brad Guzan he expected the foul to be awarded Villa’s way.

Lambert expressed his pleasure at the outcome, given Agbonlahor’s importance to the team and the absences of Ashley Westwood, Nathan Baker, Philippe Senderos and Kieran Richardson.

'It is great for us,’ Lambert said. 'I said at the time I didn't think it was a red card and everyone's assumption was the same. Ex-referees have come out and said it wasn't.

'So your own common sense told you it wasn't a red card. Gabby is playing really well at the minute so we hoped it would be rescinded.

'We are still without a few - Westy, Nathan, Senderos and Richardson - so we didn't want another one out. Not one of your big players.’
