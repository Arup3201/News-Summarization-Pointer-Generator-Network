A former member of President Obama's Cabinet has revealed that he now expects to make $4million in his role as an executive at CitiGroup.

Peter Orzag left his post as the Office of Management and Budget director in July 2010 and got a major salary boost when he joined the bank in 2011.

Now his ex-wife is fighting for a renegotiated child support package and the court documents showed how dramatically his pay has increased since joining the private sector.

Current wife: Peter Orszag, seen here with then-fiancee Bianna Golodryga at a White House State dinner in May 2010, is fighting with his first wife (not pictured) over child support payments for his two oldest children

Last year, he reportedly made $3.1milllion but he apparently expects to make $4million this year.

Mr Orzag was married to Cameron Kennedy, whose maiden name Hamill but has since adopted her mother's name, until 2006 and the couple had two children together.

At the time, they agreed that he would fund a $400,000 trust that would cover school tuition for their children and other unidentified major expenses.

It is not clear if they had a separate alimony agreement but Ms Hamill has not been reliant on him for money as The Washington Post reports that she is a consultant for McKinsey and makes $350,000 on her own.

The children's fund has been depleted over the past eight years between tuition at Georgetown Day School which ranges from $32,100 for pre-kindergarten to $36,890 for seniors in high school.

Together: Orszag's children from his first marriage- Josh (left) and Leila (right)- live and go to school in DC while he and Golodryga and their son Jake (center) live in New York while he works for Citigroup and she for ABC

Tuition: Orszag has offered to pay Georgetown Day School tuition- which ranges from $32,100 for pre-kindergarten to $36,890 for seniors in high school- for this two children from his first marriage but his ex wants a monthly stipend

Orszag, who was President Obama's youngest Cabinet member and is now 45, has offered to replenish the fund and pay the tuition bills directly so that they would not drain the fund.

Ms Kennedy has a different plan, however, and wants him to pay $22,000-per-month. That plan would amount to him paying $264,000-per-year as opposed to one lump fee for the trust.

Split: Questions linger about when exactly Orszag and Claire Milonas (pictured in 2005) broke up, and whether or not he knew she was pregnant with their daughter Tatiana at the time

His lawyers have nixed her proposal, slamming it as 'backdoor alimony cloaked as child support'.

Orszag
 fought the court to try to have the 
financial battle sealed but the D.C. court ruled that it would be ‘both 
inappropriate and untenable’ to keep Orszag’s earnings private.

The salary increase will also mark a blow for Democrats as Orszag was one in a string of Obama administration heads who left for more lucrative jobs on Wall Street. 

This has been the biggest child support battle yet for the economist but it is not the first time that his personal life has played out on a public stage.

After he and Ms Kennedy split in 2006, he was momentarily one of Washington's most eligible bachelors.

The 6 foot 2 inch Massachusetts native had something of a cult following with fans who launched a website called Orszagasm.com.

His
 public profile became more about his personal life than public policy 
in 2010 when he got engaged to ABC Weekend anchor Bianna Colodryga weeks
 after his ex-girlfriend gave birth to his child.

Orszag
 split from his shipping magnate heiress girlfriend Claire Milonas in 
the spring of 2009 when she was three months pregnant.

In
 November of that year, Ms Milonas gave birth to their daughter Tatiana 
Zoe, and less than six weeks later, Ms Golodryga announced on air that 
she was engaged to Orszag.

According to The New York Times, friends of Ms Milonas began talking to the press, alleging that he had promised to marry her after she became pregnant but then left her after meeting Ms Golodryga.

In the joint statement that Orszag and
 Milonas issued in January to deal with the gathering storm, they allude
 to the fact that they split months before the birth but never said 
exactly when.

Official: Golodryga, pictured with Orszag at the White House Correspondents Dinner in May 2010, announced their engagement on air and showed her ring which friends of Milonas took as an insult

Newest addition: Orszag and Golodryga live in New York (pictured during a visit to the Intrepid) with their son Jake though he also has a residence in D.C.

'We were in a
 committed relationship until the spring of 2009. In November, Claire 
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Although we are no longer together,
 we are both thrilled she is happy and healthy,' the statement read. 

Some reports allege that Orszag and Ms Golodryga first met at the White House Correspondents Dinner which was held in May 2009.

His lovelife was clearly a poorly kept secret at the time, as President Obama even made a joke at his expense the following year, saying that a new reality show would be launched called 'Jon & Kate Plus Peter Orszag'.

Orszag and Ms Goloryga have since added to his brood when their son Jake Spencer Orszag was born in April 2012.
