A family of millionaire travellers who were jailed for forcing vulnerable men to work as slave labourers have been ordered to repay more than £2million.

The Gloucestershire-based Connors family benefited from more than £5million as a result of their crimes after tricking homeless men and drug addicts into living with them on the promise of work, money and accommodation.

William Connors, 54, wife Mary, 50, their sons, John, 31, and James, 22, and son-in-law Miles Connors, 25, were jailed in December 2012 after being convicted of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour.

However, a judge has now ordered them to pay a total of £2million within six months or face an extended prison sentence of up to six years.

William Connors, 54, (left) and his 50-year-old wife Mary (right) were both jailed in December 2012 for forcing vulnerable and homeless men to work as slave labourers at their caravan park in Staverton, Gloucestershire

The couple's son's (from left to right) John, 29, and James, 20, and their son-in-law Miles, 24, were also jailed

Judge Michael Longman issued the court order today following a five-day proceeds of crime hearing at Bristol Crown Court.

William Connors was told to pay back £1.5million or face six years' jail and his wife has to pay £140,000 or face 20 months' imprisonment.

Their children, John and James, owe the courts £305,000 and £135,000 and, if they fail to pay, face prison sentences of 38 months and nine months respectively.

Miles was told to pay £17,000 or face nine months' jail.

£500,000 seized by the police three years ago will be forfeited immediately while the Connors' victims will receive nearly £150,000 in compensation.

Gloucestershire Police said it was the largest confiscation order in its history. 

The Gloucestershire-based family were caught after a major undercover surveillance operation which saw police film more than 8,000 hours of footage, including this clip of Connors assaulting one of his slave workers

The Connors forced the men to work and live in squalid conditions while they enjoyed a luxury lifestyle including lengthy holidays abroad, cruises (above), a fleet of expensive cars and a number of investments in property

Police began investigating the family in 2008 after the remains of a former worker were found near a caravan site.

Undercover surveillance revealed workers were living in cramped, filthy conditions, while the Connors lived the high life in plush accommodation and jetted off on luxury holidays.

As well as holidays, they drove around in top-of-the-range cars, including a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a Rolls-Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick-up, a Ford Ranger and a Mercedes van, and had built up a mounting property portfolio potentially now worth millions of pounds.

Several houses - including one with a hot tub and accompanying flat screen television - were registered in the names of other relatives.

The family bought two caravan parks in Gloucestershire for £545,000 more than a decade ago and had £576,000 in bank accounts seized by the police. 

The Connors' enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in Staverton, Gloucestershire, in Enderby Leicestershire and in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in March 2011 following a lengthy surveillance operation.

More than 8,000 hours of footage captured the men carrying out humiliating tasks including emptying buckets the family used as toilets, as well being subjected to brutal beatings.

Despite all of the family being jailed in 2012, William Connors (left) is the only one to remain behind bars as the others, including wife  Mary (right)  have all since been released. However, they face jail again if they don't repay

The Connors, who lived at this large property in Willowdean, Gloucestershire, enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with the money they amassed from their crimes. The rich travellers invested in property, holidays and expensive cars

Police found hundreds of pounds dumped in a toilet when they raided one of the family's properties in 2011

The victims - believed to be 37 in total - were paid as little as £5 per day and those who received state hand-outs had the money confiscated by the family.

The family initially denied any wrongdoing but were each convicted, by a unanimous jury, of conspiracy to require a person to carry out forced or compulsory labour.

Between them they were given 18 years behind bars, though four out of the five family members have already been released.

In December 2012, William was jailed for six –and-a-half years while his wife Mary, also known as Brida, received a sentence of two years and three months.

John was jailed for four years and James got three years' detention in a young offender institution. Son-in-law Miles received a three-year prison sentence.

Apart from William, who remains in prison, the other members of the family have been released.

Christopher Quinlan, prosecuting, said that the family gained in the region of £5million from their crimes.

The family will be forced to sell a number of properties, as well as land, and caravan parks, cars, caravans and jewellery to pay the costs.

Judge Longman warned the family that if the money was not paid back within the allocated time they would be handed further prison sentences ranging from nine months to six years.

At least five slaves were found working for the family at Green Acres caravan park in Bedfordshire. They will now be forced to sell a number of properties, as well as land, to pay the costs owed to the court and victims

Detective Inspector David Sellwood said that it was a relief to have the case wrapped up after four years and ten months of hard work.

Speaking outside court, he said: 'There were times when we thought we might get nothing so today's result is phenomenal.

'Getting a conviction was one thing but making them pay back was another.

'Now, 18 months after we started looking into the money situation, they have been ordered to pay back £2.25 million.

'They have already signed over around half a million pounds in bank accounts, so that is money that can be recovered quite quickly.

'This is not going to be something that stops. They owe £5 million, so if we see them driving around in flashy cars or purchasing luxury homes we will go after them.

'I am really happy with the amount they have been ordered to pay back today though - it sends out a message to criminals that we will get proceeds of crime back.

'This really will have a damning effect on the Connors family.'
