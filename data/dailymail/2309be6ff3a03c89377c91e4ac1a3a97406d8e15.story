A Connecticut swim coach is charged with enticing a minor and risk of injury to a minor after the mother of a 13-year-old girl caught him sending sexual text messages to her daughter.

Police say texts from Alan Marcel, 28, to one of his swimmers were 'explicitly sexual,' according to the Hartford Courant. 

Marcel is the head coach of the Park City Wolfpack, a swim team at the Wheeler Recreational Center in Bridgeport.

The young girl was a member of the swim team and Marcel was arrested at the center Wednesday on $20,000 bail. He appeared in court Thursday where he bail was reduced to $10,000, the Courant reports.

The girl's mother found multiple text messages between the coach and her daughter on her daughter's phone. She reported her findings to the swim team's board of directors, according to NBC Connecticut.

The young girl told police that she and Marcel had been texting for almost two weeks, and police say that Marcel asked the girl what specific sexual activities she would be interested in having, according to ConnecticutPostings. 

Police say one of the texts from Marcel read: 'Is it bad I wanna to about (sic) that stuff with U.'

The youth swim club told WFSB that it has cut all ties with Marcel. In a statement, the team's board of directors said they are 'deeply disturbed' by the incident and they are extending their full cooperation in the investigation.

Applaud: A local student praised the action of the girl's mother saying she protected the young girl from a potentially dangerous situation

In an interview with WFSB, a local student applauded the girl's mother. 

'Good job on mom for that one,' Olivia Stewart, a University of Bridgeport student, told WFSB. 'Even checking the phone, [she] saved her daughter from a potentially dangerous situation.'

The recreation center is operated by the University of Bridgeport, but school officials say Marcel is not affiliated with the university, the Courant reports.

Marcel's next court date is Dec. 11.
