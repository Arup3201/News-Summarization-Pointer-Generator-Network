Everton midfielder Ross Barkley doesn't have any kind of buy-out clause in his contract, manager Roberto Martinez has revealed.

Barkley signed a new four-year deal with the Toffees at the end of July. But despite pledging his future to Everton a matter of months ago the 20-year-old continues to be linked with a switch to either Manchester City or Chelsea next summer.

However, should either club attempt to lure the England international away from Goodison Park, they will have to meet Everton's valuation after Martinez quashed rumours Barkley had a price on his head.

'No, there are no buy-out clauses in any of the contracts,' said the Spaniard. 'The only one was with Marouane (Fellaini) and that wasn't triggered, so it didn't matter.

'All the speculation and talk is positive. Because you don't get any of that when your players are not playing well or they haven't got potential.'

The last time a young English player of such precocious talent was at Goodison Park he was sold with his best years well ahead of him. But Martinez claims the financial parameters are now different from a decade ago when Wayne Rooney left for Manchester United.

'Football and finances always go hand in hand,' explained Martinez, ahead of his side's clash with Burnley on Sunday.

'Now at Everton, every decision is going to be a football decision.'

Martinez accepted, however, that every player ultimately does have their price.

'If you are going to lose a player for three times over the market value I am sure that the football club would be in a better state,' he said.
