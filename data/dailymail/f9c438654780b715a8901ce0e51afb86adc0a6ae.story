Lukas Podolski has been to stop 'blaming others' for his lack of playing time at Arsenal by Germany's 1990 World Cup-winning captain Lothar Matthaus.

Podolski has failed to start a Premier League game so far for the Gunners this season - featuring just seven times off the bench for Arsene Wenger's side.

The 29-year-old has been recently been linked with a move to Italian giants Inter Milan as a result of his unsettledness, but Matthaus is adamant Podolski should accept his position on the bench and honour the remaining 18 months of his contract at the Emirates.

'What Podolski seeks is not important,' he told the Hamburger Morgenpost.

'What matters is what Arsenal want. There he has a contract to fulfill.

'In Bayern, he fled. The only club where he was a regular player was at Koln. You cannot always blame others if things go wrong. There are just others that are better.'

Podolski's last league appearance for Arsenal was as a second half substitute in their 4-1  win at home to Newcastle United on December 13.

The Germany international was an unused replacement for the Gunners festive clashes against QPR and West Ham, but is expected to be included in their match day squad for their trip to Southampton on New Year's Day.
