Manchester City fear striker Sergio Aguero could be out for longer than was first thought.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini had hoped to have the Argentine back within four weeks but scans have revealed that Aguero, who injured his knee in Saturday’s 1-0 win against Everton, has a twisted medial ligament that is expected to take longer to recover from.

If Sergio Aguero is out for the same length of time as David Silva, he will miss the following fixtures:  

December 10 Roma (A) Champions League

December 13 Leicester City (A)

December 20 Crystal Palace (H)

December 26 West Bromwich (A)

December 28 Burnley (H)

January 1 Sunderland (H)

January 3/4 Sheffield Wednesday (H) FA Cup Third Round

January 10 Everton (A)

January 18 Arsenal (H)

The injury is similar to the one David Silva suffered on October 29 and the Spaniard has not played since. 

Now, the responsibility for leading City’s attack in their crucial Champions League clash at Roma on Wednesday night will fall to Edin Dzeko.

The 28-year-old has only two Premier League goals this season and none in Europe. After their home win against Bayern Munich last month City still have the chance to qualify for the last 16.  

Meanwhile, City have been left exasperated after FIFA concluded that there was insufficient evidence to open disciplinary proceedings against Croatian side HNK Rijeka over an alleged incident of racial abuse towards young midfielder Seko Fofana during pre-season. 

The club’s Elite Development Side, managed by Patrick Vieira, were playing in Novigrad in July when Fofana, 19, was sent off by the referee for kicking out at an opponent.

City later said that they believed Fofana was racially abused moments before he lashed out.

Once alerted to Fofana’s complaint, Vieira went on to the pitch and, after holding discussions with the referee and City officials, the decision was taken for his players to leave the field.

The news reverberated around Europe but Sportsmail can reveal that FIFA will take no action against the Croatian team. A FIFA spokesman confirmed that there was not enough evidence to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings.

He added: ‘The chairman of the FIFA disciplinary committee, based on the information at his disposal, was pleased to observe Davor Suker (president of the Croatian Football Federation) and Patrick Vieira engage positively to work through the issue.’

The relevant parties were notified on Friday when, ironically, FIFA emphasised their zero-tolerance stance against any form of discrimination.
