Comedian Ralphie May was escorted by police out of his concert venue on Thursday night after he allegedly indulged in too many marijuana-infused edibles and 'lost the plot' on stage.

The 42-year-old entertainer was reportedly so high by the start of his performance at the Avalon Theater in Grand Junction, Colorado, that he struggled to make it onto the stage.

When he finally managed to reach the mic, he apparently 'couldn't string a sentence together', had trouble finishing jokes and constantly forgot his place in his highly-anticipated set.

His 'below-par' performance sparked anger among audience members, with some screaming at him to start telling jokes. Soon, a group had gathered in the theater's lobby, demanding refunds.
