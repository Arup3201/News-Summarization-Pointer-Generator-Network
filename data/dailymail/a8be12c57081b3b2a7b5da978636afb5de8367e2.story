A 67-year-old woman in Clairemont, California, found herself going for an unexpected swim when she drove her SUV into a backyard pool.

At around 2:40 p.m. Janet Walter drove her black 2010 Subaru sports utility vehicle through her garage and two fences, before driving the vehicle into her neighbor's pool.

The driver was able to get herself out of the car without help, and only had minor injuries which were later treated on the scene. After the crash, Walter refused to talk to the media. Family members told ABC 10 News that the driver's only injury was a cut on her finger.

The driver's neighbor, Lynn Lynn, heard the crash and ran to the scene along with other neighbors.

'We all ran over there and got into the backyard behind and I kept yelling for her and I could hear her,' Lynn told Fox 5 San Diego. 'I didn't realize that she had kept going into the pool.'

Lynn told reporters that the driver may have accidentally stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake.

'I heard her tell the officer that she stepped on the brake, but it kept going,' Lynn told CBS 8.

The driver's son-in-law says that it was the woman's recent knee replacement that affected her ability to control the vehicle.

Responding fire fighters were surprised she wasn't hurt.

'She seemed, for the circumstances, she seemed pretty together,' San Diego Fire Department Captain Sean Murphy told 10 News. 'She just seemed understandably shook up.'

About two hours later, a San Diego towing company was able to pull the vehicle out of the pool.

Rafael Quezaea, who was tasked with towing the vehicle out, said it was a difficult task.

'We don't really see this type of work everyday, but we have to figure it out,' Quezaea told Fox 5.

Quezaea said they did their best to minimize damage to the pool.

'You just have to play with the cables,' Quezaea said. 'Play with the cables and the cables are going to move the car around that's what it is. We just work as we go.'

The pool did incur some damage, but is covered by insurance.

The only victims of the crash seemed to be a submerged cellphone and a water-damaged Sudoku book.
