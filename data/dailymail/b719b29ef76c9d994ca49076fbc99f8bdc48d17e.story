A Californian man said to be desperately in love with his former army veteran roomate has been convicted over her death.

Kwang Choi 'KC' Joy, 55, was yesterday found guilty of second-degree murder of California State Fullerton student, Maribel Ramos.

The 36-year-old's body was found badly decomposed near Modjeska Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains last year, two weeks after her family had reported her missing.

Ms Ramos had served in Iraq before she returned to Santa Ana to study at California State Fullerton

Exactly how Ms Ramos, who served in Iraq before returning to Santa Ana to go to college, died remains a mystery.

Prosecutors said Joy, who had surgery to make his eyes look younger, bought Ms Ramos a ticket for a cruise, but panicked after she told him to move out of their apartment when he couldn't pay the rent.

Orange County Deputy District Attorney Scott Simmons told the jury last week: 'Maribel was his life, and the opportunity for him to be with the love of his life was coming to an end,' NBC Los Angeles reported.

Ms Ramos was last seen on CCTV, dropping off her rent on May 2, 2013.

Earlier that day she had argued with Joy over rent, a fight that led to her death, prosecutors said.

The jury also heard that less than two weeks before her death she had called emergency services saying she was 'afraid' following an argument with Joy.

Joy attended vigils for Ms Ramos and spoke of his affection for her before his arrest

The court was shown evidence that Ramos had gone to a public library and researched how long it takes for a human body to decay, and the location where Ms Ramos' body was found.

Joy, who had attended vigils for Ms Ramos, spoke to several media outlets about the woman he described as his 'best friend' before his arrest.

He is due to be sentenced on September 12 and faces 15 years to life in prison.
