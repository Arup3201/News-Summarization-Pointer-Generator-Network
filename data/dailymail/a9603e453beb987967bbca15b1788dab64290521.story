Loyal: Michelle Perra became a qualified life coach to help sex addicts - after supporting her own husband get over his addiction to porn and prostitutes. The couple pose together happily last year

After discovering her husband was addicted to porn and prostitutes, Michelle Perra had every right to end the marriage.

She was devastated after husband Craig confessed to cheating on her with a stripper and eight call girls.

But instead of leaving the love of her life, she decided to support him get over his addiction - and became a qualified life coach to help other sex addicts.

The mother-of-two says it not only made their marriage stronger - it inspired her to help other women in her position.

Now she and former lawyer Craig, 42, are both qualified sex and porn addiction coaches and counsel addicts through their company Feed The Right Wolf.

Mrs Perra, from Sacramento, California, said: 'Some people don't understand why I took Craig back but they don't see the side of him that I do.

'He is an amazing husband and father but when his addiction took hold he became someone else.

'I had vowed to stick by him when I married him and that's what I did.

'After everything we've been through I'm still sure that he's the man I'm meant to be with for the rest of my life.'

Mr Perra, who was molested as a child, was secretly logging on to porn websites at home several times a day and visiting strip clubs after work just months after marrying Michele in 1998.

But his addiction escalated and by 2011 he was paying for sex up to four times a week, spending thousands of dollars on prostitutes, strip clubs and porn.

And, at its worse, he would disappear from the family home he shared with his wife and their two children for cheap one-night stands.

Mr Perra said: 'It was a dark ugly time. I was hurting the ones I love, Michelle and the kids. I had no love for myself and none to give.

'The turning point came when I realised I was ruining my life and hurting Michelle. It hit me that this was completely unacceptable and I had to stop.'

After a bender which lasted two months, Mr Perra finally broke down and confessed everything.

Mrs Perra said: 'I spent hours crying at night, wondering why I wasn't good enough for my husband.

'It was devastating but I saw Craig was broken man and I wanted to help him for the kids' sakes.

'I helped him to find a therapist and very slowly we built up our trust again.

Dedicated: Mother-of-two Michelle says the couple's marriage has been made stronger by their ordeal and inspired her to help other women in her position. This picture shows the couple on holiday before the birth of their children in 2001

'It was an incredibly slow process but we got back to where we had been before.'

Today, after 15 years of marriage, the couple are happier than they've ever been.

And they're now counseling men, women and couples from all over the world.

Mrs Perra said: 'There are lots of people who are suffering in silence and both Craig and I wanted to use what we'd been through to help them.

'Not only are we helping others but it's also brought us closer together.

'Incredibly, we are now the happiest and strongest we have ever been.'

Mr Perra added: 'I worried Michele wouldn't stick by me but I knew that I was going to do everything possible to heal myself and earn back her trust and love.

'We had to reconnect and it was like we were starting from scratch but now I have a love I never knew existed.'
