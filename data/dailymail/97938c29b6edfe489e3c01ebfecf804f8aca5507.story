Pilot: Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, 48, was preparing for a flight to New York this morning when he was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol

A pilot for American Airlines subsidiary American Eagle has been arrested as he prepared to fly some 53 passengers from Minneapolis to New York City while drunk.

Police were tipped off by witnesses who said Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, 48, smelled like booze, as he was conducting preflight checks in the cockpit of a Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft.

Officers boarded the plane at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport just before 6:30 a.m today and made the pilot, from Raleigh, North Carolina, take a breathalyzer test, which he failed.

He was then arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol and taken into custody.

'There was a witness who smelled what they thought was alcohol on the pilot's breath and notified police,' airport spokesman Patrick Hogan said.

Passengers had not yet boarded the flight to La Guardia, New York City, he said.

American Airlines has suspended Kristiansen pending an investigation into his boozing, according to spokesman Matt Miller.He added that the carrier was cooperating with authorities.

Flight 4590 was delayed about two-and-a-half hours while a replacement pilot was arranged. The aircraft finally took off at 8.50am and arrived in New York at 12:11p.m.

Kristiansen was taken to Fairview Southdale Hospital to have a blood sample taken for testing, before he was returned to the custody of airport police.

Hogan said he didn't know exactly what blood-alcohol reading the pilot blew. But he said 
the alcohol limit for flying is lower than for driving a car.

'In Minnesota, the legal limit for pilots is 0.04, much stricter than someone traveling on a road in the state,' he said.

American Airlines said in a statement: 'American Eagle has a well-established substance 
abuse policy that is designed to put the safety of our customers and 
employees first. We are cooperating with authorities and conducting a 
full internal investigation. The pilot will be withheld from service 
pending the outcome of the investigation.'

Along with the 0.04 percent limit, Federal Aviation Administration regulations also prohibit any pilot from flying within eight hours of drinking alcohol, what the agency calls 'bottle to throttle,' according to the Star Tribune.

'A hangover effect ... may be just as dangerous as the intoxication itself,' the FAA claims. 'Consider the effects of a hangover. Eight hours from 'bottle to throttle' does not mean you are in the best physical condition to fly or that your blood-alcohol concentration is below the legal limits.'

Between 10 and 13 commercial pilots a year have been found with a 'confirmed breath alcohol concentration" of 0.04 per cent or higher since 2008. In 2002, 22 pilots were found to be over the limit.
