Tony Pulis is considering building his team around Saido Berahino and insisted everybody at West Bromwich Albion wants him to stay beyond this transfer window.

Berahino raised eyebrows by not celebrating any of his four goals against Gateshead in the FA Cup, furthering speculation he wanted a move away from the Hawthorns.

He was charged this week with drink-driving and is due to appear before North Cheshire magistrates in Runcorn on 19 January. 

West Brom manager Tony Pulis has insisted striker Saido Berahino is a 'pleasure to work with'

Pulis took charge of West Brom last weekend and says the club are keen to keep Berahino 

But Pulis said the striker had been the last to leave every training session, staying late with assistants David Kemp and Paul Jewell, and work was being done to ensure he could play without off-field distractions. 

‘We’ve had no offers for Saido, he is scoring goals and is a pleasure to work with,’ said Pulis. 

‘We have to make sure he has a clear mind on the pitch. I’ve had a chat with him and he’s been smashing. We’d like to keep him.’

Asked if he could construct his side with Berahino as the focal point, Pulis said: ‘Oh yes. He’s a goalscorer. He’s got technical ability and wonderful balance. He’s gifted.’

Pulis added: ‘Everyone is available in some form. Would I want to sell him? Not at all. He’s been first-class.’

However, Pulis is hoping to bolster his forward line with a bid for Watford striker Troy Deeney — a move which might suggest Berahino is close to leaving the club.
