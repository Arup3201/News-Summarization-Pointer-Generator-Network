Retired military officials could be barred from meeting ministers and officials after a group were caught boasting they could use old Whitehall contacts to secure deals for arms companies.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the ‘top brass for hire’ scandal was ‘deeply damaging to the individuals and their reputations’.

‘There are many reasons why it is sensible for the MoD to maintain contact with retired officers,’ Mr Hammond said.

Allegations: Former military chiefs including ex-head of the Army Lord Dannatt (left) and Admiral Sir Trevor Soar (right, with Prince Andrew) are reported to have boasted about lobbying top officials to secure contracts for private firms in breach of Whitehall rules

‘But if they are abusing that access 
for commercial purposes then we will have to tighten it up or maybe even
shut it down. That is something we will now look at.’

He insisted: ‘There is no way retired officers influence the way military equipment is procured.’

Six ex-senior officers were secretly 
filmed discussing how to influence ministers and ex-colleagues, claiming
they could help set up multi-million-pound deals for firms wanting to 
sell equipment to British Forces.

The revelations have shone fresh light on the revolving door between the Ministry of Defence and private weapons companies.

The former commanders spoke to 
undercover reporters posing as representatives of a South Korean firm 
eager to sell unmanned drones.

One – Admiral Sir Trevor Soar – was 
still within the two-year period when personnel leaving office are 
barred from working in the private sector.

The ban ensures retired 
military officers do not exploit ‘privileged access or sensitive 
information’.

Those caught on camera were Royal 
British Legion president Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely; former MoD
procurement chief Lt Gen Richard Applegate; Sir Trevor, until this year
commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy; ex-Army chief General Lord 
Dannatt; Lord Stirrup, the ex-head of the Armed Forces; and General Sir 
Mike Jackson, another former head of the Army. All denied any 
wrong-doing.

Embarrassing: Sir John Kiszley, left, was caught on camera boasting of his influence, but Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, right, insisted the retired personnel wielded 'no influence' over procurement

Lord Dannatt, who retired three years 
ago, met undercover reporters in his grace-and-favour apartment in the 
Tower of London.

The 61-year-old was offered what he called a 
‘reasonable’ £100,000 fee for two days’ work a month.

He claimed he 
would target senior mandarin Jon Thompson, his old school friend, over a
£400million deal to manage the MoD’s sprawling estate.

Sir John, who advises defence firm 
Babcock International, boasted about lobbying for a £4.3million deal to 
take over MoD properties during the ‘purdah’ period – under which firms 
are barred from lobbying.

He bragged he could raise issues with the Prime Minister and other high-ranking figures at Remembrance Day events.

The Legion has launched an investigation and Sir John faces losing his post. He has denied speaking about Babcock.

Sir Trevor told undercover reporters 
he had ‘to be slightly careful of lobbying ministers’ but would 
‘basically ignore [the rules]’.

He said yesterday his private jobs had 
been officially approved and he was motivated by bringing 
‘battle-winning equipment to the Navy’.

Lt Gen Applegate also bragged of flouting the lobbying ban. He denies breaking any rules.

Mr Hammond warned arms firms over 
their behaviour. He said: ‘If we were to make clear to companies the 
kind of lobbying being talked about here will damage rather than benefit
them, that will be quite effective.’

Lord Stirrup, who retired as the head 
of the UK military two years ago with a £2.9million pension pot, said he
would encourage his military contacts to tell the MoD about the drones.

The former airman said yesterday he told the undercover reporters lobbying was not an effective way to win business.

He added it would be ‘strange’ for a military man not to be interested in technology which could save British soldiers’ lives.

The MoD said it was investigating whether any rules had been broken.
