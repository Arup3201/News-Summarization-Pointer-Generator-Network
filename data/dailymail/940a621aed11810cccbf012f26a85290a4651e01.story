The most senior officer of the Titanic to survive the ship's sinking downplayed the cause of the disaster as a 'small low-lying iceberg' in an insurance claim form which has come up for sale.  

In the unique document, second officer Charles Lightoller wrote that the ship made a 'slight jar' before starting to go down.  

He also tried to excuse the behaviour of staff who failed to spot the iceberg, denying that they were guilty of 'negligence' or being insufficiently vigilant.  

Lightoller's insurance claim is believed to have been an attempt to minimise the responsibility of the ship's owner, White Star Line, in order to secure the full payout of $5million (£3million).

The historic document detailing his account of the disaster is being sold at auction by Henry Aldridge and Sons of Devizes, Wiltshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £12,000.  

The RMS Titanic sank on the night of April 14, 1912, after it struck an iceberg which was 50-100ft high and 200-400ft wide, with more than 1,500 people dying in the catastrophe - partly thanks to the lack of sufficient lifeboats.  

The ship was insured by 77 different insurance companies, for a total of $5million, meaning that Lightoller had to fill out a loss sheet as soon as he arrived in New York City.  

Together with third officer Herbert Pitman, fourth officer Joseph Boxall and fifth officer Harold Lowe, he gave an account of the accident.  

In the testimony made to Robinson Leech, the notary public for New York, on April 19, Lightoller explained that 'all went well' until 11.45pm on April 14 when the ship struck an iceberg.

Form: The front page of the insurance claim signed by Lightoller and three other officers

He stated: 'The captain was on and off the bridge throughout the watch. A sharp lookout was kept from the crow's nest.  

'The ship was on course South 86 degrees West true when the lookouts reported ice dead ahead.  

'The first officer immediately starboarded the helm reversed the engines full speed and closed all watertight doors.  

'The ship swung to port but struck a 'growler' or small low-lying iceberg with the bluff of her starboard bow, making a comparatively slight jar with a grinding sound.'  

He went to explain that 'all hands were called on deck' and the lifeboats were filled with women and children.  

Signed: The four officers were the most senior staff of the ship to survive the deadly disaster

Historic: The sinking of the Titanic was one of the worst maritime disasters in history

Claims for the Titanic totalled £16million - the equivalent of £1.7billion in today's money.

The life insurance policy payout to the wife of John Thayer, a prominent businessman from Philadelphia, who drowned in the disaster, was the largest of its time at £31,000. 

Strangely, his wife died on the same day as when the ship went down - 32 years later on April 15, 1944. 

William Carter, who survived, claimed £3,100 for his Renault car that sank with the ship.

This became the first ever claim for a vehicle damaged in a collision with an iceberg.

White Star Line paid out around £2.5million to Titanic claimants - £2.2million to British claimants and £400,000 to Americans. 

However, people in the US originally filed claims totalling £10million - so only a fraction of this was eventually paid out.

He added: 'At 2.20am, April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank, going down bow first in very nearly the same position as when struck.  

'The master, chief, first and sixth officers were lost and also all the engineers and the pursers and their staff as well as the chief and second stewards.'  

Part of the small print signed by the four officers states: 'Any loss, damage or injury which has arisen in any way or manner is solely owing to the accidents and difficulties herein set forth and declared and not to any negligence, want of skill, vigilance or exertion on the part of the deponents or any of the officers or men of the said vessel.' 

White Star was able to receive a payment of $4.25million - the full value of $5million, minus a deductible of $750,000. 

One of the main insurance companies that covered the Titanic was Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company of New York, which folded three years ago after failing to recover from claims related to the September 11 terror attacks.  

Lightoller's insurance claim was one of a haul of historic documents contained in the firm's archives, and was bought by an anonymous dealer who is now selling it in Devizes on April 26.  

Andrew Aldridge, of Henry Aldridge and Sons, said: 'If you have a car accident we have to fill out an insurance claim form and this form follows the same principle.  

'This is the account from the four surviving officers, but intriguingly they appear to underplay the severity of the collision and the size of the iceberg as if to minimise the encounter.  

'This could be to try and downplay the negligence potentially - the smaller the iceberg the harder it is to see.  

'There is nothing else like this document out there and is another reason why there is this endless fascination with the Titanic story and new information about it emerge so many years later.'
