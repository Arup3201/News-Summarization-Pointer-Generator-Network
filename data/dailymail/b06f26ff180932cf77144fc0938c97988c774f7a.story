She's done a remarkable job of overseeing her family’s rise up the social ladder – but these pictures might give Carole Middleton something to be a little anxious about.

For they show that her son James, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger brother, is still in a relationship with TV presenter Donna Air – ‘a single mother from Newcastle’, as some commentators snobbishly sniped.

The pair were inseparable for much of last year, but when they spent Christmas apart it triggered reports that their relationship had hit the rocks. However, Donna and James – who are just coming up  to their first anniversary – have laughed off rumours of a split.

They enjoyed a relaxed rendezvous on Friday at James’s West London office – and these exclusive photographs show them venturing out separately to take James’s dog Ella – the sister of Kate’s cocker spaniel Lupo – for a walk.

They slipped out of the base of James’s baking company Nice Cakes, which is above a sushi  restaurant in South Kensington,  moments apart, before joining up for their first public outing together since early November.

They met at a dinner party in February last year and became a fixture at showbiz bashes, but at the tail end of last year, Donna, 34, attended several without her 26-year-old toyboy, first prompting reports of a split.

The couple also spent the festive period apart. James decamped to the £4.5 million family manor house in Bucklebury, Berkshire, for Christmas with mum Carole, a former air hostess, dad Michael and sister Pippa and – later – Kate, William and six-month-old Prince George.

Meanwhile Donna returned to Newcastle to spend Christmas with her family before heading to Goa and Kerala in India for some  New Year sunshine with Freya, her ten-year-old daughter with her  ex-partner – the 53-year-old casino-owning multi-millionaire environmentalist Damian Aspinall.

A source close to James told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘People were saying they’ve split because they haven’t been photographed for a while but they are still together and everything’s good.’

And a friend of Donna’s – who is soon to launch her own jewellery range – added, ‘They will have been together for a year soon. They are as happy as ever and have laughed at reports their relationship is over.’ As well at being regulars at various London members’ clubs last year, the pair were also spotted out clubbing with James’ sister Pippa and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Last September, Donna told The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine: ‘James is wonderful .  .  . And yes, there is also the bonus that he  brings something I have always searched for and will always need in my life... cake.’

Meanwhile, another picture of James has just been made public – as a photograph of him as a teenage at Marlborough College has been posted on Facebook by his old school pal James Simison. 

Rumours: The couple were pictured together publicly in September (left) and November (right), but spent Christmas apart triggering rumours of a split. A friend of Donna's, however, said they laughed off the notion
