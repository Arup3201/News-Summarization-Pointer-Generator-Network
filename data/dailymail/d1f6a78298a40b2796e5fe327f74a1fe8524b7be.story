Families are wasting up to £80 a year by leaving televisions and games consoles on standby, experts have warned.

Households across the country could make savings of a total £1.7billion a year by turning off all their appliances when they are not in use, according to the Energy Saving Trust.

Three quarters of homes with a spare television keep it permanently switched on standby, according to an Ipsos MORI poll of more than 2,000 people found.

Experts believe that many people do not realise that leaving an appliance plugged in will consume high quantities of energy.

Some 55 per cent of homes have one or more game consoles and nearly two-fifths of those with consoles leave them on or on standby when they are not in use, the poll found.

Just leaving a single games console on standby can run up a bill of up to £30 a year in electricity.

Three quarters of those polled said they were worried about energy bills.

But only half of households which had received an unexpectedly high bill said they had taken action but switching off their unused appliances, the research revealed.

Philip Sellwood, chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust, said: ‘We are a nation on standby.

‘Whatever your age, gender or the size of your household: our research has found millions of us are unintentionally wasting electricity when we leave our gadgets on standby. It's an easy mistake to make yet it costs us a fortune.’

He added: ‘Televisions and games consoles are now among the primary sources of our everyday entertainment, yet when left on permanent standby they are costing £45-£80 a year.

‘I'm not suggesting we get rid. I'm urging people to take back control of their appliances and switch off when we aren't using them.’

Appliances could also be wasting people's money if they are old, with a fifth of people owning a fridge or freezer that is at least 15 years old.

Old appliances are more likely to be inefficient and to have developed faults that the owners might not be aware of, such as a faulty thermostat on a freezer which could mean it is costing £45 more a year to run than it should, the experts said.

Turning off lights when they are not needed can save £7 a year, while replacing all the remaining old-fashioned light bulbs with energy efficient ones and halogen lights with LEDs could save around £45 a year on bills.
