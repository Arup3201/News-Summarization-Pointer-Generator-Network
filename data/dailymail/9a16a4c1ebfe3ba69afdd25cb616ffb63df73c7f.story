At White Hart Lane last Wednesday, Burnley manager Sean Dyche turned to the fourth official and asked him: ‘What’s the ******* point of having that (the earpiece) if you don’t ******* tell him.’ It was over something innocuous, debating whether Tottenham Hotspur should have been awarded a corner in the moments leading up to Mauricio Pochettino’s team scoring their third in this FA Cup replay.

Managers at the very highest level of the game have had enough of this lottery, frustrated by the match officials’ seemingly random decisions.

Sadly the modern training methods used by clubs in the Premier League means that the game is drifting further and further away from the referees.

The official that night at White Hart Lane was Craig Pawson. At 35 he is something of a spring chicken compared with Chris Foy (52), Phil Dowd (51), Mike Dean (46) or Martin Atkinson (43), but what chance do they really have of keeping up with 20 Premier League outfield players for 90 minutes? The answer is none.

Last weekend’s round of fixtures in the Barclays Premier League brought another fresh round of debatable decisions, all of which could be solved with the assistance of some video technology.

Even Arsene Wenger admitted that Arsenal had been fortunate to earn a penalty at the Etihad on Sunday when Nacho Monreal collided with Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany.

At Turf Moor, Phil Dowd failed to spot Burnley’s Scott Arfield throwing Crystal Palace defender Joel Ward off the ball (and off the pitch) for Burnley’s second goal.

Jose Fonte appeared to handle at St James’ Park during Southampton’s impressive victory over Newcastle United.

On Monday evening at Goodison Park, Everton could easily have been awarded a another penalty when West Bromwich Albion defender Claudio Yacob appeared to throw Stephen Naismith into the goal during the 0-0 draw with Tony Pulis’ team.

The reality is that we are asking a group of guys, most of them in their mid-thirties upwards, to make the correct calls when they are on the move.

At least in tennis and cricket, both fast moving sports, the officials are stationary when they make a decision, and they usually have the benefit of video technology for further assistance. The Premier League is operating in an era when the game’s speed merchants can run sub-11-second 100 metres and there isn’t a top referee in world football who can keep up with the sprint kings.

It is little wonder then that referees, who cannot recover aerobically in anywhere near the same time as a 20-something player in peak physical condition. They cannot keep up.

The test for international UEFA referees has changed in recent years from a 12-minute continuous test around a running track in which the official had to run 2,700 metres.

Since then it has moved on, split into two sections designed to test speed and endurance.

The first tests speed, with referees given a running start to complete six 40m sprints in less than six seconds, each with a 90-second recovery. A Premier League player would not even break sweat.

A test for stamina is the second part of the elite referees’ test, with 10 laps of the 400m track (10 x 150m in sub-30secs) with a recovery in between. That’s meat and drink to a Premier League player.

In the past, various studies have indicated that fatigue plays a part in the ability to make cognitive decisions.

Premier League referees, tiring in the second half of the game, are most likely to make errors as the clock ticks down.

Despite the inconsistencies, change seems a long way off because it will need six of the eight members of the International Football Association Board to vote in favour of technology.

Four of the board members are from FIFA and the other four are picked from each home nation. Change is rarely swift.

It took an age for the goalline decision system to be approved, but it is rarely called upon. The bigger decisions take place in other areas of the field.

On Sunday, after Arsenal’s ultra-impressive victory over the defending champions at the Etihad, Wenger admitted he was in favour of video assistance for offsides and fouls.

Referees’ chief Mike Riley and the recently-retired Howard Webb have visited Holland recently, where the a trial system is in place for the fourth official to use video technology.

Premier League footballers, like Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, can run super-fast speeds for long periods

Top-level officials cannot be expected to keep up with Premier League players for 90 minutes alone

Alexis Sanchez and other stars are ultra-fit and can keep running at high speeds for extended periods

Fatigue causes cognitive decision-making to become more difficult, so referees need extra help

If Wenger’s ideas are to be taken on board, then the ability to use instant replays to determine fouls and, by extension, simulation can only help the game in this area.

Most people would welcome that, particularly in an age when overseas players are being encouraged to protect themselves by refining their falling technique to a) prevent injury and b) to win free-kicks.

This is a modern scourge, one of the biggest issues confronting the game at this moment.

With the technology in place, it would lead to a far greater understanding of the game.
