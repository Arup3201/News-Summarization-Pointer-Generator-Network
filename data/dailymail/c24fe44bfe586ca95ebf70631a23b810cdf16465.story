As a Burberry model, Vogue cover girl and socialite Jourdan Dunn is seemingly living the supermodel dream.

But her enviable lifestyle and stellar success is bittersweet because Jourdan, 24, is also a mother who's regularly forced to leave her son behind when she jets around the world for work.  

The Victoria's Secret model has a five-year-old named Riley and has revealed she was envious of her mother spending so much time with him when she first began working internationally.

Jourdan Dunn, pictured arriving for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in December 2014, is only 24 but she already has a lucrative career that most women could only dream about

Speaking in the February issue of British Vogue magazine, which she covers, Jourdan said: 'They are so close I was kind of jealous of their relationship in the beginning. But it works for me. 

'You can find the balance of being a working mother, but I couldn't do it without my mum. She is the one who allowed me to go and do my thing.'

The catwalk star also claims other models couldn't relate to her at first because they didn't understand her commitments as a mother.

Jourdan added: 'I love that one day I am doing this and then I go home to my reality: getting Riley ready for school, doing his reading with him, taking him to the park.

'For some in this industry their life is their work. The other girls didn't understand in the beginning why I didn't want to go out all the time.'

Jourdan, who was scouted in her local Primark at the tender age of 15, fell pregnant aged 18 and after giving birth to her son Riley, his father was arrested for possession of cocaine.

The catwalk star also claims other models couldn't relate to her at first because they didn't understand her commitments as a mother. She and Cara Delevingne are, however, fiercely close 

Jourdan was in a predicament, left alone to balance her increasingly successful working life with her flailing personal life.

And things didn't get any easier for the mother from Ealing after Riley was diagnosed with sickle-cell anaemia, an inherited, noncontagious blood disorder.

The disorder leaves sufferers with a shorter life expectancy and periods of sickle-cell crisis that last a few days and require serious medication and hospitalisation.

Although Jourdan doesn't have the disease herself, she and the father of her son are among the 250,000 people in England estimated to carry the genetic mutation that causes it.

Jourdan Dunn posted her first Vogue cover to her Instagram account and revealed her joy at becoming the first solo black model to grace the cover of British Vogue for more than 12 years

Speaking to the Sunday Times Style magazine at the time, the model said: 'I found out I carried it when I was pregnant, which was a huge shock. 

'The first time Riley had a crisis, I was working in New York and due to travel to Puerto Rico. Mum was amazing and reassured me he was in the best hands and that I should keep working.'

Riley has to take penicillin and folic acid daily and Jourdan worries that more awareness should be raised about the disease.

She said: 'It's something people don't really know about, due to the fact it's genetic, so it doesn't have the high profile of HIV or malaria,

'Riley looks just like a normal boy, but I can't get away from the fact he has a serious disease.'

Jourdan intends to use her status as a famous model to help garner more support for the Sickle Cell Society, which she strongly supports. 

Taking it in her stride, Jourdan has powered through life and juggled her thriving modelling career with the demands of being a single parent.

The modelling world has been extremely accommodating of Jourdan's decision to be a mother first and a model second, with Jean-Paul Gaultier even making her a special pregnancy catwalk outfit for a show. 

Last week, Jourdan was revealed as the first solo black model to grace the cover of British Vogue for more than 12 years.

The 24-year-old Londoner shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on Instagram to her 954,000 followers after speculation on Twitter today.

She wrote: 'I'm so Happy to finally say I'M ON THE COVER OF BRITISH VOGUE!!!' 

She added: 'Thank you Patrick Demarchelier and Kate Phelan for making this happen and also thank you all for the Love and Support it means everything to me #2015YearOfTheDunn.' 

Although this is her first solo Vogue cover, Jourdan did previously front the magazine in 2008 along with Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Eden Clark.

This also marks a change for the fashion bible as it is the first time they have featured a solo black model on the cover since Naomi Campbell appeared in 2002.  

Jourdan has enjoyed a highly successful career so far and has been the face of Burberry beauty along with Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell

This is the latest in a string of good news for the model. At the beginning of last month she took a highly successful turn on the Victoria's Secret runway as the show hit London for the first time.

Then in mid-December it was revealed that Jourdan and Naomi Campbell were the faces of Burberry's Spring / Summer 2015 campaign.

She said of the shoot: 'This campaign is even more special for me because I was shot with Naomi Campbell for the first time - someone who I admire and respect within the fashion industry.'

She is also a firm favourite on the fashion party circuit counting Cara Delevigne, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May Jagger amongst her close friends. 

Last year, Forbes announced that she was the 10th highest paid model, making an estimated £2.65m ($4m) last year and beating world-renowned beauty Cara, who earned £2.3m ($3.5m).
