The plug has been pulled on the world's second most watched clock after Big Ben.

The countdown clock at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida was dismantled after being in operation for over 45 years.

Millions of people worldwide would watch the clock tick off the minutes and seconds to blast off at the launch site.

It was first used for the Apollo 12 launch in 1969 and continued for six other moon launches and all 135 space shuttle launches.

The clock had 336 light bulbs and has now been replaced with a digital version in time for the launch of the Orion rocket next week from the space centre at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

NASA chiefs said the old clock was the second most watched clock after Big Ben in London.

Measurements: Workmen measure parts of the clock before loading it onto a vehicle to be driven away

Second: The part of the clock which used to tell the seconds is put on a truck before it is driven away

Hour: The part of the clock that used to tell the hour is tied up and put on a truck after it was dismantled
