Confectionery giant Walls is stepping back in time to recreate a forgotten favourite, Funny Feet.

The strawberry flavoured ice-cream will be relaunched after online voters chose it as the brand they would most like see back on British shelves.

The popular foot-shaped treat was axed from production in the 1990s, but is set to make its come back this week.

Bringing back a classic: Funny Feet will make their way back onto supermarket shelves tomorrow after 6,500 online voters chose it as their favourite forgotten treat

An old favourite: Original packaging shows how Funny Feet was bought and sold in the 1980s. Its production was halted by more modern treats such as Magnum

Its relaunch is the result of the Facebook campaign, Bring back a brand, created by The Grocer magazine.

After a long search, confectionery producer Unilever tracked down the original Funny Feet model to ensure the popular ice-lolly was made exactly as fans remembered it. 

Assorted toffees, Toffo, will also make a come back after the Bring back a brand Facebook campaign was launched by The Grocer magazine

Toffee flavoured chocolate bars Trio are also set to make a comeback. Online voters were given the opportunity to vote for new packaging designs too, but many suggested sticking to the original look

Noel Clarke, who works for the company told the Sunday Mirror: 'There wasn't a conscious decision to get
rid of Funny Feet. It was just pushed out by innovation.

'The 1990s saw 
the launch of the Magnum, for example.' 

If the relaunch goes well, Walls will consider bringing back its chocolate variation too.

Funny Feet trumped brands such as Banjo, Turkey Twizzler and Fuse bars among others to win one of the three top spots.

The competition gave voters the chance to nominate their favourite sweets for reproduction.

With a winning score of 6,500, Funny Feet will make their way back onto shop shelves this week.

Other winners were assorted toffee sweets, Toffo, and toffee flavoured chocolate bar, Trio. 

Funny Feet is available to buy in supermarkets from September 2 onwards.
