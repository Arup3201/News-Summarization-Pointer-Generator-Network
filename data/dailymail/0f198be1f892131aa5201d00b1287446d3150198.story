CIA manuals offering tips to help spies maintain their cover while using false documents as they crossed international borders have been released by Wikleaks.  

The two documents, dating from 2011 and 2012, are marked classified and 'NOFORN,' which means they were not meant to be shared with allied intelligence agencies, WikiLeaks said.

The documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders.

Some are obvious -  don't buy a one-way ticket with cash the day before flying, although others are less so - don't look scruffy while traveling on a diplomatic passport.

The manual states: 'Mental preparation almost certainly helps travelers pass secondary scrutiny.'

The guide states that travelers who attract attention and appear suspicious qualify sentence meanings with 'words like “typically,” “normally,” “often,” “maybe,” or “almost” or phrases like “to be honest,” “the truth is,” or “swear to God.'

There is a section devoted to baggage and lists reasons for detection including: 

• Baggage or contents inconsistent with the passenger's appearance, profession, or ticket class 

• An unexplained lack of baggage probably would raise suspicions.

• Multiple new items, such as alarm clocks or notebooks, in baggage.

• Carelessly packed baggage when passenger is purportedly an experienced business traveler.

• Unopened and unmarked maps, guidebooks, or other literature. 

• Maps of unrelated cities in baggage for a purported tourist traveler.

• Camera quality not matching the traveler's profile or camera memory card insufficient for a lengthy tourist trip.

The guide lists countries which look for certain types of travelers - for example it states Japanese customs officials pay attention to single, Western travelers  'because they may be drug couriers.'

Similarly it states that in Tel Aviv, officials are on the look-out for 'military-aged males traveling alone with backpacks... regardless of their nationality or skin color.

In one incident during transit of a European airport in the early morning, security officials selected a CIA officer for secondary screening,' one of the documents reads.

'Although the officials gave no reason, overly casual dress inconsistent with being a diplomatic-passport holder may have prompted the referral.'

The CIA agent involved went on to have his bag swabbed for explosives and it tested positive. 

Despite extensive questioning, he stuck to his cover story that he had been involved in counterterrorism training in the United States, and eventually was allowed to continue his journey.

'Consistent, well-rehearsed, and plausible cover is important for avoiding secondary selection and critical for surviving it,' the CIA wrote.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration'

In a statement, WikiLeaks said this example 'begs the question: if the training that supposedly explained the explosives was only a cover story, what was a CIA officer really doing passing through (a European Union) airport with traces of explosives on him, and why was he allowed to continue?'

One of the CIA documents, called 'Schengen Overview,' reveals that the CIA is very concerned about EU nations introducing biometric security measures for people traveling on US passports and that new systems pose an increased 'identity threat' - in other words, making it harder for agents to travel on false documents.

The document focuses on the EU's Schengen area, a chunk of Europe in which travelers between 22 EU countries are no longer required to show passports.

The CIA expressed concerns that a new EU security system will potentially make life harder for CIA agents.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration. 

These manuals show that under the Obama administration the CIA is still intent on infiltrating European Union borders and conducting clandestine operations in EU member states.' 

Sunday's release is the second in a series of CIA releases from WikiLeaks.
