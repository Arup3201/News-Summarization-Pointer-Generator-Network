Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski insists he wants to carry on playing in the Barclays Premier League despite being linked to Italian giants Roma.

Poland international Fabianski joined Swansea from Arsenal on a free transfer last summer and has proved a fine acquisition in keeping 11 clean sheets to help the Welsh club into the top half of the league.

Fabianski's fine form has apparently alerted Roma, who currently lie second in Serie A behind Juventus, but he says he is not bothered about transfer speculation surrounding him in the Italian media.

'My brother mentioned that this information (about interest from Roma) appeared in newspapers, but to be honest, I feel very good in the Premier League,' Fabianski told Polish paper Przeglad Sportowy.

'I know the language and culture. I think that the Premier League, despite the failure of English teams in European competitions this season, is still the most attractive place to play.

'That's why I'd rather not move anywhere.'

Fabianski insists he is happy in the Premier League and does not want to move abroad this summer

Fabianski has played in the Premier League since leaving Legia Warsaw in 2007.

He made 78 appearances in seven seasons at Arsenal and won an FA Cup winner's medal there last May when the Gunners beat Hull 3-2 in the Wembley final.

The 29-year-old's form has also been noted by his country as he returned to the Poland team for their 1-1 draw away to the Republic of Ireland in Euro 2016 qualifying on Sunday.
