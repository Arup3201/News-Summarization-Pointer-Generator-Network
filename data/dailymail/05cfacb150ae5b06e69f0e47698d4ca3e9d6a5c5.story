A former top model is among several women who have refused to answer questions about their dealings with Jeffrey Epstein under oath, including whether Prince Andrew was involved with under-age girls.

Adriana Ross, who moved to Florida from her native Poland in 2002, was hired to work at billionaire Epstein’s Florida mansion and helped to organise his diary.

She was interviewed on video in March 2010 by a lawyer for alleged abuse victims as part of civil proceedings against the paedophile financier. But she repeatedly invoked the US constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which protects people against incriminating themselves.

Miss Ross was asked: ‘Has Prince Andrew ever been involved with under-age minor females to your knowledge?’ She replied: ‘I refuse to answer.’

The former model gave the same response when asked if she had ever met Prince Andrew or flown on Epstein’s plane with the royal. Miss Ross did not answer any other questions about her involvement with Epstein.

She was one of four women who worked for the billionaire who were named as ‘potential co-conspirators’ in a plea bargain agreement in which they and Epstein were given immunity from future federal prosecution in the US.

Two of the others – Epstein’s personal assistant Sarah Kellen and his Yugoslav model girlfriend Nadia Marcinkova – also refused to answer questions. Miss Kellen has been accused in US legal documents of bringing Epstein a succession of under-age girls for sex.

During the civil proceedings, she was asked by a lawyer: ‘Would you agree with me that Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein used to share under-aged girls for sexual relations?’

She replied: ‘On the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege.’

Miss Marcinkova was asked: ‘Have you ever been made to perform sexually on Prince Andrew?’ She answered simply: ‘Fifth.’ Other women said to have been present when Epstein abused under-age girls have not commented on the latest claims about Andrew.

Actress Emmy Tayler (pictured), who was said to be close to Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, has also refused to comment

They include Johanna Sjoberg, one of the financier’s young personal masseuses, who has previously claimed that she allowed the prince to put his hand on her breast for a photograph in 2001.

British-born aspiring actress Emmy Tayler, 40, who was said to be close to Epstein’s ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, has refused to comment on her relationship with the billionaire. This weekend there was no answer at an address linked to her in Oxford.

A close acquaintance of Andrew last night said his predilection for the high life lies at the root of many of his public travails, and those of his former wife, Sarah Ferguson.

‘The fact is that both Andrew and Sarah love to live a millionaire lifestyle, without having the actually millions to fund it,’ the family friend told the Mail. ‘They are, therefore, drawn to people that can.’

The Duke of York and his ever-present duchess have nurtured a group of eye-wateringly rich friends and acquaintances who can bankroll their love of swanky foreign resorts and private jets.

In 2011, Andrew was the guest of Saudi billionaire Mohammed Abdul Laif Jameel on a super yacht moored off Corsica, while in 2010, he was seen on another yacht said to be chartered by a ‘millionaire friend’ – this time in Sardinia.
