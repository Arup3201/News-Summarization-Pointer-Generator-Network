Millions of dollars earmarked for those struggling to get back on their feet after Hurricane Sandy has been held back from those in need because of banks' red tape.

More than $200million of insurance money is being held back at some of America's biggest financial institutions, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office on Monday.

Letters have reportedly been sent to  Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase by state officials telling them to speed up the release of funding.

Ravaged: Insurance claims adjusters pick their way through the burnt out homes of Breezy Point, New York. Many victims of the disaster have not yet received much-needed funding, NY Governor Cuomo revealed today

According to CNN, thousands of homeowners are waiting on checks amounting to around $208million.

Governor
Cuomo released a statement which said: 'Families need to be 
able to return to their homes and the state economy, which took a hit 
from Superstorm Sandy, needs the boost from spending on repairs.

'After
insurance companies have sent homeowners checks to pay for repairs, the
money should not be sitting with the bank because of red tape.'

One reason for the hold up appears to be that banks often have to 
endorse a check that comes from insurance companies, according to Cuomo.

The banks involved have not immediately commented.

Hurricane Sandy caused at least 53 deaths in New York City and wreaked an estimated $42billion in damage.

Around 100,000 homes suffered storm damage with more than 2,000 being declared uninhabitable.

Across the U.S., Sandy is blamed for more than 130 deaths and tens of billions of dollars in property damage.

Last month, President Obama signed a $50.5billion emergency measure for Sandy victims. The money is urgently needed to start rebuilding homes, businesses, public transportation facilities and other infrastructure damaged by the October 29 storm, one of the worst to strike the Northeast.
