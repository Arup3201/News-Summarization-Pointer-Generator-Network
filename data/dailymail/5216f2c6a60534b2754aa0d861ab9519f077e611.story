Portnoy had no comment on whether or not Jordan is a billionaire.

A six-time NBA champion with Chicago Bulls, Jordan earned fame and fortune on the basketball court, as well as through endorsements and movies.

The 51-year-old became the majority owner of the Hornets (formerly the Bobcats) in 2010 when he bought out Bob Johnson's share of the team.
