Pre-season
 training is all about building up strength for the gruelling campaign 
ahead, and Arsenal have wasted no time in getting ship-shape.

Gunners
 stars including Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Santi 
Cazorla were all pumping the iron in strenous excercises at the Gunners'
 London Colney base.

Arsene
 Wenger was on hand to put his side through their paces as the likes of 
Aaron Ramsey, Tomas Rosicky and Kieran Gibbs got ready for the new 
season.

Arsenal
 kicked off their pre-season schedule with a 2-0 win at Boreham Wood on 
Sunday before Saturday sees them start their USA tour with a match 
against Gunners legend Thierry Henry's New York Red Bulls.

Ahead of their tour, Wenger said he can't wait to play in a country where the World Cup was so widely embraced.

'It is the first time since I [started to] go to World Cups that I've been stopped by so many American people,' he told Arsenal's official club website.

'I can 
tell you something I'm completely convinced of - before people didn't 
know who you were, but now every American guy I met knows Arsenal, knows
 England and knows the Premier League.

'The enthusiasm about soccer in the States is new but big. I expect us to have a good crowd there.

'I hope that we can help to develop the interest in the game and that we can play a good match there to make people enjoy it.

'It is the perfect time to go. I always wanted to go with Arsenal to the United States, so I'm personally very happy to do it.'
