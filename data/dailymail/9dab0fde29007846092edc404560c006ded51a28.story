The British nurse fighting for her life after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone could remain in a critical condition for 'some time', her family said today.

Pauline Cafferkey was diagnosed with the deadly virus following her return to Glasgow from Sierra Leone.

The 39-year-old had been a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town. 

She is currently being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Today, her relatives said in a statement: 'We would like to thank all our friends, family and the members of the public who have contacted us with support following Pauline's diagnosis with Ebola. 

'We have been very touched by the kind words.

Pauline Cafferkey, Britain's latest Ebola victim, remains in a critical condition at London's Royal Free Hospital where she is being treated by doctor Michael Jacobs - and may do for some time, her family said today

'Pauline continues to be in a critical condition at the Royal Free Hospital. We want to thank all the staff caring for her for their kindness, support and compassion.

'Pauline's condition could remain the same for some time and we would again ask for her and our privacy to be respected.'

Ms Cafferkey was diagnosed with Ebola following her return to Glasgow from Sierra Leone where she had been a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town. 

The 39-year-old is currently being treated in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

The nurse was admitted to an isolation facility at the Brownlee unit in Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, at 8am on December 29. 

After a blood sample tested positive for Ebola, she was transferred by military plane to the Royal Free Hospital the following day. Her condition deteriorated in the new year and remains critical.

At the Royal Free, where fellow nurse William Pooley recovered from Ebola this year, she is in a cocooned bed in an isolation ward where medics treat her wearing protective suits. 

However one expert believes Ms Cafferkey has just a 50/50 chance of survival.

Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist from the University of Reading, said the experimental drug ZMapp used to treat nurse William Pooley at the same hospital would only be available sometime this month.

It is therefore down to Pauline Cafferkey's 'genetics' as to whether she would pull through, he said.

But with the experimental drug ZMapp used to treat nurse William Pooley (pictured) at the same hospital unavailable, it is now down to her 'genetics' as to whether she would pull through, one expert said

Praising her efforts in fighting the deadly disease, he said: 'She's a hero. Nurses in particular are at the highest risk because they've got to deal with bodily fluids which are full of the virus.

'They're brave, they're great and I'm glad they are helping sufferers in Africa.'

He added: 'At this point it's about a 50/50 chance that she makes it.

'People in the West have a better survival rate than in West Africa - it's something like 1 in 4 who died in comparison to about half or even three quarters in African hospitals.

'There's very little medical science can do to change the outcome. We don't have any sure fire answers to Ebola.

'Some people will be resistant, other's won't. A lot of it depends on genetics.'

He added: 'A large part of Ebola is essentially your own immune system beating you up. The longer that goes on, eventually you get blood leaking out and then it's over.

'Prolonging it longer is a good thing so the body can build up antibodies but reducing the severity of the virus is the key thing.

'You can kind of tell at this point what is going to be the outcome.

Ms Cafferkey left Sierra Leone  on her long journey back to Glasgow via Casablanca and Heathrow

'The clinical team will have a pretty good idea by this point. They'll be able to tell by seeing the virus levels in her system.

'ZMapp is a combination of three antibodies, little sticky things that are in people's blood.

'They ran out of this. They were supposed to be ready around the beginning of January - they must be close to being ready.

'I haven't heard anything about it recently. We don't know what the drug they are using to treat her is.'

Speaking of the international response to the outbreak he said: 'Ebola has dropped out of the press but is killing about 50 people a day across the globe.

'It's not as serious as it was but it has killed off a lot of people.'

Save the Children has launched an investigation into how she was infected but admits it may never establish the exact circumstances.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Ms Cafferkey 'continues to receive the best possible care'.

The decision by Heathrow officials to wave Miss Cafferkey through even though she said she felt ill sparked the search for 203 people who may have had contact with her on two flights

With more health workers due to return to the UK from Sierra Leone in the next two weeks, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged: 'We will keep all of the procedures under review. 

'It is important that we learn lessons from the case of Pauline Cafferkey and that we learn lessons from any other case that might arise.

'I hope there are no other cases identified in Scotland or the UK but it is likely we will see other cases, a small number of additional cases, and we need to keep learning from the experience of dealing with them.' 

Yesterday a person with a 'history of travel to West Africa' tested negative for Ebola after being placed in isolation at a Welsh hospital.

The person, who has recently returned from an area of West Africa affected by the virus, was admitted to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff after developing a fever.

A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: 'Public Health Wales can confirm that an individual tested for Ebola earlier today at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital does not have the disease.

'There may be other explanations for their symptoms for which tests are already under way. 

Earlier this week, a Briton who was feared to have the deadly virus tested negative for Ebola at Swindon hospital.

The negative case follows two suspected patients last week - in Cornwall and Aberdeen - who were also confirmed not to have the virus. 

The first safety trial of an experimental preventative Ebola vaccine also began this week at a British university.

The Oxford Vaccine Group, part of the University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, aims to have vaccinated 72 healthy adults by the end of this month.

Developers of the drug, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, have now accelerated it due to the continued spread of Ebola in West Africa. 

Ebola has so far killed 8,153 people and infected 20,656 in the past year, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures.
