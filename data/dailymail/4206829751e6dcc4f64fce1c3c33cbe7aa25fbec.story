The Slender Man stabbing victim is back at school, doing well and enjoying life despite her horrific ordeal barely one year ago.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online family spokesman, Steve Lyons, has shared details of Payton Leutner’s remarkable recovery and revealed how her parents have sat through every minute of the preliminary court hearing currently under way to determine whether or not their daughter’s assailants will face trial as adults.

He said: ‘Payton’s mother and father have been attending court. They’re doing so because they felt they need to to move forward.

‘As difficult as it is to hear these horrific acts, they’ve worked so closely with the District Attorney that there’s very little they weren’t aware of. To hear it and see it at the proceedings is horrific but it’s helping them with the healing process.’

Smiling again: Payton Leutner is working hard at school and enjoyed celebrating her 13th birthday despite being stabbed repeatedly by the girls she thought were her best friends

He continued, ‘Payton is doing very well at school. She’s working hard and enjoying her studies. Physically her wounds have healed and she’s strong. Emotionally it’s going to be a lifelong process and they’re taking it one day at a time.’

It is almost a year since Payton Leutner, then 12, was lured into woods near her home in Waukesha, Wisconsin in late May and brutally stabbed 19 times by friends hoping to win the approval of sinister fictional character, the Slender Man.

Just one day earlier Payton had excitedly gone to a sleep-over with Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12 at the time of the attack, unaware of what police have described as the five month plan concocted by her best friends intent on murdering her. The slumber party was to celebrate Geyser’s twelfth birthday.

Stabbed in the chest, abdomen and arms, doctors later stated that the knife allegedly wielded by Morgan Geyser passed less than a millimetre from a major artery, leaving Payton ‘the width of a human hair’ away from death.

She was found by a cyclist having crawled to the edge of the wood in which her friends had left her to bleed to death.

Checklist: This hand written note from Morgan Geyser's sketchbook shows a list of 'supplies necessary' before she and Anissa Weier stabbed their friend, Payton Leutner, in the woods last year. Noticeable is the reminder to bring a 'kitchen knife', a 'map of forest' and 'the will to live'

This week her parents Stacie and Joe Leutner have relived something of that horror in court each day as a judge decides whether Geyser and Weier will face murder in the first degree as adults – a charge which carries a possible penalty of 60 years in jail.

According to Mr Lyons, speaking for the couple, ‘They have faith that justice will prevail. They have worked so closely with the DA but they haven’t commented on whether they believe the girls should be tried as adults.’

Yesterday they heard how Geyser – a girl whom they had welcomed into their home as their daughter’s best friend – filled sketchbooks with grotesque and violent cartoons.

Page after page of the books, seen by the court, revealed images including a young cat-like girl armed with a scythe standing over a dead girl with a speech bubble that says, ‘I love killing people.’ Elsewhere the 12-year-old wrote of her admiration of the Slender Man, whom she allegedly sincerely believed to live in a mythical Mansion in the woods.

As well as the disturbing sketches the court saw Geyser’s mutilated Barbie doll and a list of ‘supplies necessary’ for the crime which included a map of the forest and ‘weapons (kitchen knife).’ Payton was stabbed with a five inch blade.

They also heard psychologist Deborah Collins who has interviewed Geyser several times, give testimony that the girl appeared to genuinely believe in the existence of the macabre Slender Man. She allegedly believed that he would kill her family if she did not kill Payton.

Eerie and prescient sketches: This is one of Morgan Geyser's sketches. The 12-year-old is one of two girls accused of stabbing her friend Payton Leutner and leaving her in the woods in May 2014. In this frightening picture a girl who appears to be a cat-like and armed with a scythe stands over a dead girl while saying 'I love killing people'

According to Ms Collins, ‘[Her belief] hasn’t wavered and it’s been unyielding to a rational perspective.’

Questioned by Geyser’s attorney, Antony Cotton, who is forwarding the argument that she is not mentally competent to stand trial as an adult, Ms Collins also told the court that Geyser claimed to use Vulcan mind control to fight depression and that Harry Potter villain Lord Voldermort visited her.

Mr and Mrs Leutner have not, Mr Lyons disclosed, spoken with Payton about the court proceedings. He said: ‘I don’t think they discuss it with her. If there’s anything she wants to discuss they will talk about it but their focus is on their little girl.

‘They are an amazing mid-Western family with mid-Western values. They feel that if they let what Payton’s assailants did to her dictate their future it will eat them up.

‘Their focus is purely on getting Payton better emotionally.’

As she was: Payton pictured before she came within a 'hair's breadth' of death when she was stabbed by the two girls who had invited her for a sleepover, in pictures posted by her family to mark her 13th birthday

And according to Mr Lyons, though that is a long and difficult road, Payton’s recovery – both physical and mental – is nothing short of remarkable.

On Friday the girl who came a whisper from death celebrated her thirteenth birthday.

Mr Lyons said, ‘She loves animals and so she went to her favourite animal shelter and hung out there. She’s a huge cat lover so she had a wonderful, fun day.

‘She really is an amazing young lady.’

Immediately after her attack Payton’s family established Hearts for Healing, a fund with a target of $250,000 to foot her medical bills. They also asked people to send hearts in purple fabric (her favourite color) with the aim of covering the walls of her bedroom with the symbols of support.

They have been, Mr Lyons said, overwhelmed with gratitude at the outpouring of generosity with which their appeal was met.

He said ‘The one thing they have shared with me again and again is their gratitude for all the people around the world that have been so gracious and loving with their prayers and their gifts for this amazing little girl.’

The judge is expected to reach his verdict by early March.

Unnerving: The Slender Man with one of his 'chosen victims' as depicted in a popular online meme 

The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009.

The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit.

The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. 

It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia.

It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport.

It is understood to have originated in a Photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009.

It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'.

The character has developed its own life online, with two feature-length films funded in part by Kickstarter appearing in 2012.

The meme that appears most is that of a tall malevolent figure, who silently stalks down his prey.
