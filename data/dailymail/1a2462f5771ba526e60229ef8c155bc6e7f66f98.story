A British dog breed which was rarer than the giant panda has been saved from extinction following a concerted effort by breeders.

There were only 52 Sussex spaniels registered with the Kennel Club in 2011, compared with 50,000 labradors. And there are believed to be up to 2,000 giant pandas living in the wild and more than 250 in captivity.

Numbers of the dogs - first bred in Hastings in the 1800s for hunting - have been fragile since, dropping to only seven after the Second World War.

But now the Sussex spaniel has increased by 29 per cent  to 74 registrations  to meet demand for the compact dogs.

They are expected to hit three figures this year, after a group of breeders clubbed together to save the spaniels.

It is hoped last year's births will help the population into a sustainable future as they become old enough to be used for breeding.

Sheila Appleby, secretary of the Sussex Spaniel Association, said: 'It is a small breed so most of us know each other and we all love and care about our dogs.

'In 2011, a group of people who knew the breed just all together decided to have a litter in 2012.

'There were eight litters in the first quarter of 2012, six in the second and two in the third. It is not that many litters compared to other breeds, but it is progress.

'The population of Sussex spaniels has been struggling since the Second World War, for some reason - we're not sure why.

'They don't seem to be very popular and they are not easy dogs to breed. People tend to go for cocker spaniels or English springers instead.

'We are doing more and more to spread the word about them and it seems to be working.

There were quite a few people waiting for puppies so the demand was there.'

The Sussex spaniel is believed to have been founded by Augustus Elliott Fuller in the 1800s in Rosehill, Sussex.

 The breed was identified by the Kennel Club in 2004 as a vulnerable British breed.

The Sussex Spaniel Association was formed in 1924 for the 'protection of the Sussex Spaniel'.

The association has 220 members.

The Sussex spaniel is a happy healthy dog.

He makes a good gun dog, a show dog, or a pet and is very adaptable.

It is a guarding breed and the dogs are quite possessive of their owners.

They
 are fine with people and children but they need plenty of 
socialisation, puppy classes, obedience classes, time and patience.

They live happily with other dogs, though they are usually top dog!

He bred the dogs to work on his large estate until the 1850s, when he died.

Other breeders took up Sussex spaniels and the population remained healthy but small until the Second World War, when many stopped their breeding programme due to rationing.

Only seven Sussex spaniels are known to have survived the war, living with animal-lover Joy Freer, who devoted her life to keeping the breed going.

The population has remained fragile ever since, with Sussex Spaniel Association members attempting to maintain the breed.

Mrs Appleby, who is based in Emery Down, Hampshire, added: 'I don't know why they are not popular because they are lovely dogs.

'They are happy and healthy and are very adaptable.

"They're lovely dogs but can be a bit bossy. I often get that look which says "This is my sofa".

'I would certainly recommend them as a loyal and loving pet.'

She said the rich golden-coloured dogs, which cost around £800 each, have a unique look, being smaller, lower and more compact than some other spaniels.

'They especially enjoy being around people.' A slightly different version of the breed is popular in America.

Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club secretary, said: 'Everybody is talking about the post-Olympic baby boom but perhaps the celebration of our British heritage in 2012 has helped lead to a revival of some of our native breeds.

'Fashion and profile have the most influential impact on dog choice and we are pleased to see there is still a place in people’s hearts and homes for our British vulnerable breeds.

'Many are still at risk but there has been significant improvement in some breeds.

'It is great to see responsible breeders rallying together to support the breed they love. Kennel Club registrations for the Sussex Spaniel have increased by 29 per cent since 2011 largely thanks to these dedicated breeders, who are helping the Kennel Club to raise awareness about the breed amongst people who might not previously have heard of its existence.

'We would thoroughly recommend anyone thinking about buying a pedigree dog to consider the Sussex Spaniel, a wonderfully charming breed, and would suggest visiting the Discover Dogs area of this year’s Crufts, in Birmingham from the 7th to the 10th of March, to meet the breed and to chat to current owners about the many fantastic qualities these dogs possess.

'People need to make sure that any dog that they choose is a good fit for their lifestyle but we hope that by highlighting these lesser known breeds people will do their research thoroughly before they buy to see if these dogs might be for them.'

Other breeds that have significantly increased in popularity include the English toy terrier (black and tan) which has seen a 25 per cent increase to 126 puppy registrations and the Irish water spaniel which has gone up by 32 per cent to 148 registrations.

The English setter has come off the Kennel Club’s list of native dog breeds that could be at risk of extinction after registrations increased by 25 per cent in 2012.

However, the significant decline of the smooth fox terrier by 46 per cent to 94 registrations and of the Clumber spaniel by 56 per cent to 151 puppy registrations, means that the overall number of dogs within the 35 breeds on the Vulnerable and At Watch lists has increased by 1 per cent.
