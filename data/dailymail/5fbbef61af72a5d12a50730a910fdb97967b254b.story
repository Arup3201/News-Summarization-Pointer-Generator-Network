A teenager accused of murdering a mentally disabled man for his coat and mobile phone was identified from CCTV footage and taken to police by his own mother, a court has heard.

Dean Mayley, 24, who was vulnerable due to a brain disorder, was targeted for his North Face jacket as he walked home in Greenford, west London, on February 7, the Old Bailey heard.

Images of the alleged attack were released to the media, and the 17-year-old, who cannot be named, handed himself in.

When asked why he had come to the police station, the 17-year-old replied ‘I don’t know’.

But his mother told officers: ‘I have come here to get him eliminated from this investigation. I know it’s my son.’

The court heard Mr Mayley suffered from microcephaly, a developmental condition that meant he had a mental age of around nine years, and was naturally trusting and vulnerable.

It is claimed the teenager was one of three youths who approached Mr Mayley and tried to rob him of his jacket at knifepoint.

Following his arrest, the 17-year-old gave a prepared statement admitting the CCTV image showed  him at a nearby KFC but denying he was involved in the robbery or the murder.

He told officers: ‘I went to get some food and was hanging out with my friends. I didn’t see anyone with a knife and was not aware of any knife on them. I am shocked and distraught I have been arrested for this offence.’

The 17-year-old was later charged with murder alongside alleged getaway driver Michael Mensah, 18, Ryan Beresford, 19, and another 17 year-old who is said to have inflicted the fatal stab wound to Mr Mayley’s chest.

Jurors heard Mensah has previous convictions for carrying knives.

On 21 September 2013 he was arrested with a 12cm blade in his trainer and a samurai sword in the boot of his Fiat Punto.

Four months later on 12 January 2014 a locknife was found underneath the driving seat of the Punto when he was stopped by police.

The 17 year-old who is accused of stabbing Mr Mayley during the attempted robbery made no comment in police interview, the court heard.

But when police searched his prison cell on 23 May 2014 they found a handwritten letter from Mensah on his desk.

In it Mensah told the 17 year-old to claim he was on ecstasy at the time of the killing and could not control himself.

The letter continued: ‘Stop acting like a f***ing kid and come correct big man ting. Someones died and if you don’t f***ing get serious and work with man to buss this your loosing your life to jail.

‘And your gonna cry like a b***h, your smiling now but you’ll cry like a b***h so fix up and come in my class so we can chat and get shit right before we go Court.’

Mensah also warned the teenager: ‘Never in your life say out loud I told you to rob anyone on a Big Man Ting, on my life never say it out loud, its not a joke.’

He added: ‘I can’t get joint enterprise because there was never an enterprise to join. I wasn’t involved in the robbery so I’m not liable.

'You did the robbery but you wasn’t in control, your mental state wasn’t correct so doing it wasn’t your fault so its manslaughter.’

CCTV footage of Beresford and the two 17 year-old boys stalking Mr Mayley as he walked home has been shown to jurors.

Mr Mayley was given first aid at the scene by police and paramedics before being taken to hospital but was pronounced dead at 7.02pm.

Mensah, of Hanwell, Beresford, of Acton, and one of the 17-year-olds, of west London, all deny murder and attempted robbery. 

The second 17-year-old, of West London, denies murder but has admitted the attempted robbery of Dean Mayley. 

Mensah also denies robbery of a 15 year-old boy on 28 January. 

The prosecution have now closed their case and the trial continues.
