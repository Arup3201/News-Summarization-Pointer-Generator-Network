Apple fans who rushed out to buy a new machine have been hit with another hidden expense - many 'Smart Covers' don't work with the new iPad.

The Â£35 covers, a much-hyped feature of Apple's machine, use magnets to turn iPads on and off automatically when opened or closed.

But Apple has changed the way the sensor works in the new machine - and many covers no longer work.

The magnetic 'Smart Covers' are oen of the most recognisable features of the new iPad - but Apple has changed the sensor so that older covers will not work

People who own older Smart Covers have been worst hit.

The problem affects third-party covers made by companies other than Apple.

Apple's forums have been mobbed by furious iPad users, some demanding a free replacement.

'What is the option? Keep buying cases til you get one that works? Wow! Apple has done it again,' said one user.

Smart Covers are one of the distinctive features of Apple's tablet, making it easier to use and more portable than rivals.

When the iPhone 4 had reception problems due to the placement of its aerial - known as 'Antennagate' - the technology giant issued free cases to users.

Manufacturers of third party cases such as Maroo are reportedly already issuing free replacements.

Others are rushing to redesign their cases - having not been warned by Apple that the sensor would be changing.

Another satisfied customer? A shopper walks out of London's Apple Store with new iPads this week - but fans have discovered the machines won't work with older Smart Covers

Apple was unavailable for comment.
