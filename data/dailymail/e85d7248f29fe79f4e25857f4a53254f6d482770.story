Since leaving the cobbles and drama of Coronation Street behind, Michelle Keegan has seen her star rise.

Not only is she filming for an exciting new drama but she's also preparing to marry the man of her dreams. Oh, and she' managed to squeeze in designing an extensive new clothing range for Lipsy, too. 

The actress-turned-designer is back with her festive collection and it's full of faux furs, cosy knits and stylish coats. 

As always, the star, who regularly tops best body polls, has modelled the range herself. 

It's here! Michelle Keegan shared behind the scenes images of her Lipsy shoot yesterday but now we can see each and every item in all its glory (playsuit, £65) 

Speaking to MailOnline about her new range, which has just landed online, Michelle said: 'There's nothing better than getting dressed up in full on Hollywood glam style. 

'I love winter - Christmas is my favourite time of year so I couldn’t wait to get back into the design room to create some classic winter pieces.

Speaking about the inspiration behind her range, she cited a certain fashionista as her muse.

'I love Victoria Beckham's style, she is effortlessly chic and looks amazing whenever she steps out.'

Michelle, who loves high street stores Zara, Mango and Topshop - because you can get 'value for your money' - also shares style tips with fiance, Mark Wright.

'He's good with his fashion choices and always looks stylish but he will ask for my opinion sometimes,' she said.

The brunette fashionista added: 'This range is my dream come true and I hope to design for many years to come.'  

Famous fan: Ariana Grande, who has a similar style to Michelle, was seen in Paris wearing a jacket from her collection this week 

Aside from designing her new range, Michelle has been busy shooting upcoming drama Ordinary Lies on various occasions in Cheshire over the last few days.

In the BBC series, Michelle reportedly plays car showroom receptionist, Tracy, who smuggles drugs through the airport for her boyfriend.

In August, a source close to the actress told MailOnline that she was thrilled to have landed a role in the six-part BBC drama.

'She's been looking for the perfect acting role for quite some time, and this one is a dream come true for her,' said the source.

'She's very excited and can't wait to start shooting towards the end of the year.'
