The Block newlyweds Karstan and Max Smith completed a 1200 kilometre mega-walk from Prahan Melbourne to Dixon Park in Newcastle, in a bid to raise money for the Starlight Foundation.

The pair arrived at Newcastle Lifesavers club on Saturday to be met by a crowd of friends, local nippers and the local Lord Mayor.

Karstan told Daily Mail Australia that reaching the finish line felt 'amazing.'

'There was a big crowd to meet us and we got a big rush of energy at the finish line. 

‘I think it’s just starting to hit us now though-we’re absolutely exhausted!’

The epic journey began on Friday November the 7th, from The Block Glasshouse base in southeast Melbourne, and took in major cities, rural towns and picturesque coastlines.

‘The highlight was definitely the scenery. We saw some magnificent sites along the way, particularly the south coast, which was just stunning,’ said Maxine.

‘There were certainly some rough patches, like when I got ill’, she recalls.

‘We were walking about 40km one day and I was so sick. But we considered with how sick the Starlight kids are, we knew we had to keep pushing on.’

The couple said they chose to support the charity because they have a close relationship with people within the company.

Karstan and Max walked a remarkable 50-plus kilometres on some days, though they did not train for the journey.

‘There was no time after the show. Reality television performers have a short-lived profile, so we wanted to use it for something positive as soon as possible. We figured we would pick up the fitness as we go.’

IGA supermarkets and thong maker Havaianas sponsored the couple in their epic trek.

‘We had backpacks filled with fresh fruit and muesli bars as well as well as 33 of pairs of thongs. We couldn’t have finished without them!’ Max said.

Although the couple have raised around $20,000 so far, they are not giving up on reaching their $120,000 fundraising goal.

‘We’ve made around 20,000 so far, but we’re definitely not giving up there and we plan to reach the goal in coming times.’
