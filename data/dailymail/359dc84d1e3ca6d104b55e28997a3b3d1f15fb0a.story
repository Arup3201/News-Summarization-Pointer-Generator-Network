Arsenal MUST win the Champions League this season, or their star man will surely want out.

Who knows what is going on in Alexis Sanchez’s mind but just put yourself in his boots for a second: what do you think is going on in his head when he takes a look at the Premier League table? 

During his little injury break I suspect he will be wondering whether he should be playing at a bigger club, a club capable of a genuine title challenge.

The Chile international has shined for the Gunners so far this term, but the club are still outside the top four

He’s had the season of his life so far – he’s been shining virtually every week for Arsenal. Yet when he looks at the table he sees that his team is not even in the top four.

How will Sanchez feel, having played so well, worked so hard, shown world-class quality, to see that those efforts have only managed to take Arsenal to fifth in the table?

In the same way nobody really knows what was going on in Diego Costa’s mind last Tuesday when he was putting his stamp on that Capital One Cup tie, I can’t be sure what is going on in Sanchez’s head.

But I’m guessing he will be feeling exasperated and frustrated, asking himself what he has to do to get this side challenging for the title.

Will Sanchez be happy staying on the Arsene Wenger train where the destination is Mediocrity Central?

Don’t get me wrong - I’m certain Arsenal will finish in the top four. And they’re still in the Champions League where a kind draw could take them all the way to a final where anything can happen over 90 or 120 minutes.

But if Arsenal don’t win the Champions League where will that leave Sanchez? Will he be happy staying on the Arsene Wenger train – destination Mediocrity Central, calling at Low Expectations Junction and Fourth Place Trophyville? He’s bigger than that of course.

He’s enjoying his football at Arsenal, some might argue. Just like he’d enjoy his football at a club that wins big trophies.

Others will wonder how I can write this stuff after the Gunners have just won 5-0. It was against Aston Villa – it’s standard behaviour for Arsenal to batter weak teams more often than not.

From the sidelines or sat in his living room Sanchez would have heard the ‘Oles’ of the Arsenal fans when their team was strolling to victory on Sunday. He might think it’s brilliant from the fans; or he might realise he’s at a club where standards and expectations are so low those fans are satisfied with a bit of keep ball when a terrible team comes to the Emirates.

Quite what he made of the last 20 minutes of the game turning into a testimonial with everyone desperately passing to young Chuba Akpom hoping for him to score a goal is anyone’s guess. It’s all very sweet and nice from Arsenal to look after a young player, but a bigger win was easily achievable, and would have landed the Gunners in the top four. That would have been a huge statement.

The elite challenge themselves – they don’t settle for fourth-best, it’s not in their mentality. That’s why Thierry Henry left in the end.

Sanchez has an opportunity to do something this season not even Henry did for Arsenal – lead the Gunners’ charge to Champions League success.

If they don’t achieve that glory, are all Arsenal fans confident their star man will want to stay?

And if Arsenal do achieve European glory this season, will all 11 players get statues outside the Emirates? I do hope so.

Surely Alexis Sanchez will want out if Arsenal do not triumph in Europe?

He has been the club's star man, but Gunners are not even in the top four

Arsenal should have beaten Aston Villa by a bigger margin... but players were happy to turn the Premier League clash into a testimonial

Sanchez would have heard the 'Oles' from the Arsenal faithful at the end... are expectations so low, they're happy with keep-ball against a poor side?
