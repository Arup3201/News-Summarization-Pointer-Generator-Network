Vogue has unveiled the original casting Polaroids of three Victoria's Secret models, taken when they first tried to appear within the pages of the popular fashion magazine. 

In honor of this year's Victoria's Secret fashion show, which took place in London on December 2 and will be broadcast tonight on CBS, the magazine dug into its archives to reveal images of models Doutzen Kroes, Behati Prinsloo and Sigrid Agren, all of whom appeared on this year's catwalk.

Taken between 2003 and 2007 and showcased on Vogue.com, the three Polaroids show each of the girls looking incredibly fresh-faced, wearing minimal make-up while modeling a plain black top or t-shirt.

Supermodel in the making: Dutch model Doutzen Kroes, now 29, revealed that her agent said the appointment at Vogue would 'make or break' her career

The images clearly contrast to the three models seen strutting down the runway at this year's Victoria's Secret show, showcasing the brand's most extravagant and ornate underwear styles, while wearing an impressive array of angel wings, feather boas and sky-high heels.

Speaking to Vogue.com about her first casting with the magazine at the age of 18, Dutch model Doutzen, now 29, recalled how nervous she was during the first meeting. 

'It was hot and humid and I was sweating like crazy!' she said of the image, which was taken on August 28, 2003. 'I remember being thankful that the sweat stains weren’t visible. 

'... I remember my agent being very clear that I needed to be on time and that this appointment was either going to make or break me. I kept thinking, “Great! No pressure!”'

Fresh-faced and carefree: Behati Prinsloo attended her first casting for Vogue at the very start of her career when she was just 16 years old

Ruling the runway: Now 25, the model has walked for the likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada

It seems she had nothing to be nervous about however. 

In the 11 years since the Polaroid was taken, the mother-of-two has gone on to appear in the last eight Victoria's Secret fashion shows and in May 2007 even appeared on the cover of American Vogue, on which she was hailed by the publication as one of the 'World’s Next Top Models'.

Fellow Angel Behati Prinsloo has had a similarly illustrious career which has seen her model for the likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada, as well as appearing on the cover of Vogue. 

But when the 25-year-old, who  married  Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine earlier this year, first entered the hallowed halls of Vogue's headquarters in New York for her casting, she admits she was more than a little nervous about the experience. 

'It was awesome - I just remember my agent making a big deal about it. I was kind of fresh, not knowing a lot about fashion,' the Namibian-born model said of her Polaroid, which she believes was taken 'about ten years ago' when she was around the age of 16.

'But with Vogue being such a big part of that world, when I found out I was going to the casting, I was obviously very nervous.'

The baby of the bunch: Sigrid Agren, who made her debut in the Victoria's Secret fashion show last year, moved from Martinique to New York in 2007 when she was 16

She's an angel: The 23-year-old, pictured at this year's Victoria's Secret show, put her career on hold in order to finish her education, before returning to work as a full-time model in late 2007

The youngest Angel to feature in Vogue.com's Polaroid line-up is French-Swedish model Sigrid Agren, who attended her first casting with the publication in December 2007 at the age of 16. 

'Being from Martinique, [moving to New York] was a big thing; it’s like going from a small city to the biggest one,' Sigrid, now 23, said of her casting. 

'Then you’re told you have to go to a meeting for Vogue! I was very shy when I just started, I was just happy to be there and it was kind of unreal and surreal.'

The fresh-faced model, who put her modeling career on hold in order to finish her schooling, which she did in 2007, shortly before her Vogue Polaroid was taken, made her debut as a Victoria's Secret Angel last year and has also walked for a number of high-end brands such as Calvin Klein, Yves Saint Laurent, Karl Lagerfeld and Louis Vuitton.
