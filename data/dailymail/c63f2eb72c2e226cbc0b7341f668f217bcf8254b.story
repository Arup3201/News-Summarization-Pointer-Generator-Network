This is one Christmas surprise you wouldn't expect.

This video shows the hilarious moment passers-by are tricked into helping a woman, who is trying to load a large box into her car.

As passers-by come to her aid on a Los Angeles street, they are shocked as a cheeky elf springs out of the top.

A frightened man covers his face after he was surprised by an elf, who popped out of a large boxÂ 

Passers-by were tricked into the situation after a young woman asked for help lifting the box into her car

The prank was constructed by Break.com, a website that allows people to upload and share their viral videos.

Men, women, teenagers and children are all duped by the trick, and some recoiled in horror or shout obscenities.

At one point a man with a rucksack springs back in shock, raises his hands in the air and utters a few expletives before moving back in for a hug.

In another scene, a surprised man staggers back before moving towards the elf and saying playfully 'you would get knocked out.'

That is perhaps one surprise with the sketch, that no one lashed out after being shaken to the core.

A blond girl nearly leaps out of her baggy jumper after flying upwards, and a long-haired chap is likewise almost taken off his feet, before exclaiming his delight after being told it's all on camera.
