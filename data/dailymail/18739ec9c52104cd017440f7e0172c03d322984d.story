When Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead were convicted of in 2013 of lighting the fire that destroyed their home and resulted in the death of their six innocent children, the entire country was baying for the couple's blood.

But no one wishes that Mick Philpott was dead more  than Mairead's father, and grandfather of the dead children, Jimmy Duffy, who has spoken in a TV interview to be shown on Sunday night.

Speaking in an episode of The Crimes That Shook Britain, Jimmy says that he'd 'like to kill the man for what he’s done to them children and what he’s done to my daughter.'

 Jimmy puts what his daughter did down to her husband's abusive and controlling behaviour

Jimmy puts what his daughter did down to her husband's abusive and controlling behaviour.

'I blame him for the way she was and the way she is now and what she’s done. All his doing. 

'If it was up to me I’d strangle the man tomorrow if I was given half a chance.'

The episode, which details the crime, also includes reflections from neighbours Darren and Jamie Butler, who were present the night of the fire.

Mairead was sentenced to 17 years imprisonment for manslaughter for her part in lighting the fire at her children's home, and attempting to blame the arson on husband Mick's ex-lover Lisa Willis.

The jailed couple were married in 2003, but Jimmy says that he had misgivings about Mick from the beginning

The pair married in 2003, and in the episode Jimmy recalls that from the beginning he had misgivings about his son-in-law.

'[At their wedding] he seemed to be mingling around everywhere in among the women, stuff like that there and half the time she was sitting there on her own, and he was nowhere near her. 

I said to him ‘You’re supposed to be with your wife today. You’re going round all these women’. And he did quite annoy me but I was in two minds of saying I’m going to whack him one, but I decided not to ruin the day kind of thing, so I just kind of bit my tongue and left it at that.'

In the aftermath of the fire in May 2012, Mick and Mairead appeared on TV to talk about the incident, but even then something didn't seem right to Jimmy.

'To me it was a show because I couldn’t see a tear. I never heard a mention of the children or ‘Find out who done this to my children.’ 

'I thought to myself, ‘What’s wrong with the man?’ Six children are dead; somebody set the house on fire. No mention of the children; no sign of a tear.

'I don’t think there was a tear coming out of Mairead’s eye either. But she just sat there with her head down, clinging on to him.'

Mairead and Mick speak to the media in Derby, 2012, following the fire that killed six of their children

Once their crime was discovered, Mick, Mairead and co-conspirator Paul Mosley underwent an eight week trial, at the end of which they were all found guilty and sentenced, Mick to life imprisonment and Mairead and Mosley to 17 years each.

However, Jimmy believes that sentencing should have been harsher, saying that some of the spectators in court believed the couple should have received an individual sentence for each of the six children who died. 

Despite saying he 'can't forgive' Mairead for her actions, Jimmy says that she's 'still my daughter, I still love her' and worries that he might somehow be responsible for what happened.

'Some nights I sit back and think what did I do wrong that she turned out the way she did? You know, I blame myself sometimes.'
