An incompetent crew of thieves left an ATM in ruins after attempting to prise it from the side of a petrol station with a stolen digger.

ThreeÂ crooks took the agricultural vehicle from a building site and drove it to a nearby garage forecourt before ramming the digger's forks into the wall surrounding the cashpoint.

They managed to puncture the masonry around the machine but as they tried to yank the ATM free it buckled and broke - with the machine's cash box remaining intact.

Mangled: The cashpoint was left in ruins after the failed heist at a petrol station in Co Armagh, Northern Ireland

The bungling thieves were unable to rupture the box and were forced to abandon their raid with the digger still embedded in the wall - having secured no cash.

Despite being dangerously close to petrol pumps they torched the digger before jumping in a white van and speeding away.

The failed heist took place at 3:30am yesterday in Co Armagh, Northern Ireland.

Philip Woods, who runs the petrol station, said: 'It was scary. We are a petrol forecourt and we are pumping fuel 24 hours.

'If the wind had blown in the wrong direction and there had been somebody on the site, who knows what might have happened. It could have been an awful lot worse.'

Abandoned: The digger was left at the scene with its forks embedded in the building. The thieves attempted to torch the vehicle before escaping

Scene: The attempted raid took place at 3.30am yesterday and police are appealing for witnesses

Local MP David Simpson added: 'I am particularly thankful to the member of the public who raised the alarm.

'The thieves set fire to the digger in the vicinity of fuel pumps, which clearly could have led to a scene of devastation.'

Police are appealing for witnesses.
