Lord Birt has warned a Scottish broadcaster may not be able to afford all of the BBC's shows

Scottish viewers could lose access to many BBC programmes if they decide to leave the UK in next month’s referendum, its former director general warned yesterday.

Refuting First Minister Alex Salmond, who has promised Scots they would keep programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who, John Birt said a Scottish broadcaster would not be able to afford all of the BBC’s shows.

Lord Birt, who ran the corporation from 1992 to 2000, also warned that the BBC would also suffer under independence, losing a quarter of its funding.

Writing in the Guardian, he became the latest high profile figure to come out in favour of the No campaign ahead of the vote on September 18.

He said some of Salmond’s claims were ‘make believe’, adding: ‘One reason for Britain’s exceptional creative and intellectual vitality is our genius for founding institutions that channel and foster our national talent. None of these bodies is more effective than the BBC.’

Lord Birt said a new Scottish publicly funded broadcaster, the SBS, would have just ten per cent of the BBC’s current budget and would have to ‘tailor its programmes and services to its modest means.’

He said: ‘Like other broadcasters, I expect the SBS will want to acquire programmes from the BBC, not least those loved by Scottish audiences. The BBC is, thankfully, independent of government so whatever is asserted wishfully in the [Yes campaign’s] white paper, the BBC will have no alternative but to act in the interests of its licence payers and to seek the best possible commercial terms for the sale of its programmes in Scotland, not least because of the financial impoverishment it will just have suffered.

‘And, of course, there may be commercial broadcasters in a new Scotland willing to pay more for the BBC’s most successful programmes than an impecunious SBS…one way or another, after independence, Scottish viewers would have to pay to receive BBC services.

‘Those who will vote for independence identify and expect many gains. But many of the advantages that the most creative and inspiring talents in Scotland have enjoyed for 300 years – of making a massive impact on a big stage to global acclaim – will be lost.’

Lord Birt said that the BBC would immediately lose ten per cent of its income if Scotland became independent.

But he said the amount it spends on TV and radio would decrease by another 15 per cent because a greater share of the licence fee would be needed to pay for other services such as the World Service.

He warned: ‘In the space of just a few years, if Scotland became independent the BBC as we know it would effectively lose a quarter of its funding. Fundamental changes to BBC services would be unavoidable.’

In February, the former Culture Secretary Maria Miller warned Scotland would lose automatic access to the BBC if it became independent.

In November, the Scottish Government published a White Paper that promised a new ‘Scot-tish Broadcasting Service’, using the BBC’s assets in Scotland, would continue to air BBC programmes.

It said viewers would benefit from similar deals to those in force in the Republic of Ireland, where many BBC shows are screened on local channels.

The White Paper said: ‘This will ensure that the people of Scotland will still have access to all current programming, including EastEnders, Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing, and to chan-nels like CBeebies.’

Mr Salmond said a Scottish public service broadcaster would be ‘based on the existing staff and assets of BBC Scotland’.
