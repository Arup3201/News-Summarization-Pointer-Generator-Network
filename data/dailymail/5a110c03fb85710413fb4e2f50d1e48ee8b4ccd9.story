Brussels has infuriated ministers with a provocative series of proposals to boost economic growth in Britain – including higher taxes, new levies on expensive homes, and more free childcare.

The European Commission acknowledged the UK economy had roared back to life over the past year, but warned of ‘imbalances’ that required action from the Treasury.

But Tories highlighted the 'irony' of the advice at a time when the British economy is storming ahead of the rest of Europe, and urged George Osborne to treat it as 'spam in his inbox'. 

Provocative series of proposals: The European Commission acknowledged the UK economy had roared back to life over the past year, but warned of 'imbalances' that required action from the Treasury

In an assessment of the state of the main EU economies, the Commission identified ‘risks in the housing sector’ as a problem for the UK and backed calls from other international organisations for the state’s Help to Buy scheme to be reined in.

The intervention – after voters used 
recent European Parliament elections to reject EU meddling – met with a 
scathing response in Westminster.

One Government source, pointing out UK growth had outstripped European rivals, said: ‘How do you spell irony?’

Dominic Raab, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, said: 'Having helped bankrupt the Eurozone and delivered the biggest anti-EU election results in history, the Chancellor can be forgiven for treating the Commission's advice as spam when it arrives in his inbox.'

Most controversially, the EC floated 
the idea of new property and land levies to hit more expensive homes, 
suggesting council tax is out of date because it is based on 1991 house 
prices.

On the public finances, the Commission
 said the UK had ‘missed its headline deficit targets’ and called for a 
‘growth-friendly approach’ which prioritised spending on infrastructure 
projects.

'The way forward': Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (pictured) said member states 'must now play their part in seeing these reforms through, even if we know that sometimes they are politically unpopular'

Suggesting taxes should go up across 
the board, the EC said: ‘To assist with fiscal consolidation, 
consideration should be given to raising revenues through broadening the
 tax base.’

Angela Merkel has slapped down David Cameron’s efforts to block the election of a Euro fanatic to lead the EU.

The German Chancellor (right) indicated she could force through the appointment of  federalist Jean-Claude Juncker.

Her comments appear to scupper Mr Cameron’s bid to secure an alternative candidate to be President of the European Commission.

Mr Juncker is a former prime minister of Luxembourg and long-standing enthusiast for a ‘United States of Europe’.

Yesterday the PM insisted it would be wrong to appoint someone ‘no one has ever heard of’.

But Mrs Merkel said: ‘I am working to ensure Jean-Claude Juncker gets the necessary majority in the Council.

‘I am also working to ensure that this decision, even if it is controversial – is made in the European spirit.’

Over the weekend it emerged Mr Cameron warned Mrs Merkel that her choice could lead to Britain’s early departure from the EU.

Childcare costs, the Commission 
warned, remain among the highest in the EU and should be addressed as 
they pose problems for second earners and single parents.

 It also said the ‘predictability’ of the planning system needed to be increased to encourage development.

The ‘non-binding’ recommendations will
 be discussed at a Brussels summit later this month. Member states agree
 collectively on what each government needs to do to consolidate and 
build on signs of economic recovery.

Commission President Jose Manuel 
Barroso said: ‘With these recommendations, the Commission is pointing 
the way forward. We believe that member states must now play their part 
in seeing these reforms through, even if we know that sometimes they are
 politically unpopular.’

But Eurosceptic Conservative MP 
Douglas Carswell said: ‘I’m afraid what this intervention demonstrates 
is that it does not matter who you vote for, the European Commission and
 high tax and spend policies win every time.’

Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 
committee of backbench Tories, said: ‘The EU economy and the eurozone 
are in a desperate battle against high unemployment and a weakened 
currency, so it’s bizarre that this unelected, unaccountable Commission 
thinks it appropriate to lecture the UK government.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable, who 
has also suggested the threshold for Help to Buy purchases should be 
reduced from £600,000, will today meet housebuilders to discuss the 
state of the property market.

And a Bill to introduce ‘tax-free childcare’ will be included in tomorrow’s Queen’s Speech. The Coalition will confirm a commitment to help 1.9million families.
