Crime Stoppers have released images of Australia's most wanted men as part of their 2014 Operation Roam. 

The not-for-profit organization has compiled a list of 18 of the most dangerous fugitives in the country, with rewards of up to $1 million for people who aid in their capture.

The nationwide police crackdown has proved immensely successful, with 3 of the men listed as wanted in the 2013 list arrested within 48 hours of Operation Roam's launch. 

All nine men were eventually arrested, with authorities emboldened to continue the initiative this year.

'The smallest piece of information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, can be the missing piece of a puzzle to solving a crime or locating a wanted person,' said Deputy Chairman of Crime Stoppers, Peter Price. 

Since the launch of this year's list, one fugitive has already been arrested. Crime Stoppers are urging people to visit their website to see if they recognise any of the men on the list. 

 If members of the public have any information regarding the criminals, they are asked to report it immediately.

'Operation Roam aims to tap into the wealth of information in our community to locate some of the country’s most wanted people,' NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Barrie said. 

The 18 men are wanted on crimes including  sexual assault, attempted murder, drug trafficking and robbery.

One such fugitive is South Australian man Stuart Pearce, who is wanted for questioning regarding the murder of his wife and three children in 1991. 

The chief executive officer of Crime Stoppers Victoria, Sam Hunter, has warned that the Parafield Gardens man may now be 'anywhere in the country', noting that the mobile nature of modern society enables criminals to move more fluidly through the nation.

'They may now be living in your neighbourhood,' Ms. Hunter said.

'They could be your neighbour or mechanic and have assumed another identity,'

'They might catch the train in the morning,'

Ms. Hunter reiterated the importance of reporting even small amounts of information.

'Any information that could be passed on to Crime Stoppers to help pass that again on to Victoria or South Australian police would be most valuable,' Ms. Hunter said.

Often pieces of information thought unimportant prove valuable, and members of the public can remain anonymous when reporting if they so desire.

'We just need to know what you know,' Ms Hunter said. 

'Every small piece of information helps police to build up an intelligence picture,'

'Even if people think it may not be worth the call we urge you to give us a call. we'll pass that on to police and they can be the judge of how useful that information may be.' 

Police recommend that members of the public should not approach any suspected wanted persons, but call Triple Zero immediately.
