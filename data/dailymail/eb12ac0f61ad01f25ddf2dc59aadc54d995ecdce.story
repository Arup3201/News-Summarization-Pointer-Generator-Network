In the latest edition of our series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, we talk to radio presenter Gaby Roslin about memories of Zimbabwe and her attitude to skinny-dipping. 

First holiday without your parents?

In summer 1980, I turned 16 and went to Israel to live on a kibbutz for five weeks. We walked in the Negev Desert and stayed on the university campus in Jerusalem - amazing and life-changing.

How do you get the holiday buzz? 

I love flying. It reminds me of my childhood when we flew to visit my grandparents in Zimbabwe.

Place you most want to visit? 

I want to go back to Zimbabwe, as it holds so many memories. I love the beautiful vast expanse of sky, the African sunset and smell.

Most romantic travel destination? 

Probably where my husband [publisher David Osman] asked me to marry him - in Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean, in 2012. He got down on one knee and proposed under the stars.

Ever skinny-dipped on holiday?

No. I'm far too self-conscious and I've never done that in my life. I'm quite shy, so absolutely no way am I ever going to skinny dip.

Your travel philosophy?

My mother was a linguist and always told me, 'Learn good morning, good evening, please, thank you and excuse me' in the local language and don't presume that everybody speaks English.

Her attitude was, eat local food, speak the language and immerse yourself.

With money no object, where would you go?

Africa. We'd go as a family to Victoria Falls and on safari.

If you emigrated, where would it be to?

I wouldn't. I love London far too much and both David and I are born-and-bred Londoners. However, if I could afford it, I'd buy a holiday home in Sardinia.

Tip for a holiday read?

I've just finished The Unlikely Pilgrimage Of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce. It's about an elderly man who gets up off his sofa and walks and walks and walks through the UK. It's beautifully written.

Gaby's radio show is on BBC London every Sunday from 3pm on 94.9 FM.
