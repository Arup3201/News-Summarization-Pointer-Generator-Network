NHS boss Karl Perryman, 52, was warned he faces jail after being found guilty of stalking female colleague Joanne O'Neill

A senior NHS manager who bombarded a female colleague with poison pen letters after she rejected his advances is facing jail.

Karl Perryman was head of complaints and legal services at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, when he sent the 'dark and spiteful' notes to junior colleague Joanne O'Neill.

Posing as a Christian woman, he also wrote to her partner, mother, the hospital and human resources manager accusing her of sleeping her way to the top.   

Perryman recruited Miss O'Neill as his 'prodigy,' but turned on her when she began a relationship with the hospital's deputy director of ICT Michael Brown, who she has since married.

The letters had a devastating effect on 39-year-old Miss O'Neill who left her family and friends as she moved more than 200 miles away to escape Perryman.

He was caught when officers found part of one of the letters on his computer.

Married Perryman was found guilty at King's Lynn Crown Court of one count of stalking and one count of intimidating a witness - Ms O'Neill's mother Margaret Titmarsh.

Miss O'Neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital, King's Lynn Crown Court was told.

But Perryman  called her afterwards to say he was 'so impressed with her as a candidate that he would do his damnedest to get her a job'.

A couple of months later she began working in his department and he promised to 'take her under his wing'. 

He described her as his 'prodigy' and she soon began covering his job when he was on leave.

The two shared friendly 'banter' but the relationship soured when he allegedly purchased a necklace for her from jewellers Ernest Jones and she refused the gift.

The first anonymous letter arrived at the hospital in December 2012 and said Mr Brown had been 'bragging' about having sex with Miss O'Neill and another female member of staff.

It claimed: 'Both of these women are allowed to dress like hookers in short skirts and dresses… they are dressing like tarts. This is a hospital, not a knocking shop.'

One said: 'She has had many promotions she does not deserve even though she has been described as next to useless by senior clinicians… one manager even said she is sleeping her way to the top.'

A few days later Miss O'Neill received a letter which accused her of 'plotting and scheming' for her own advantage.

It warned: 'You will reap what you sow… we will listen to your corridor conversations, when you're in the bathroom, so we can get firm evidence for your partner with what you've done.'

Miss O'Neill, who is now married to Mr Brown, told the jury Perryman, who was her line manager, said he would 'destroy' her if she told anyone about his bullying. 

She said: 'He made me feel like he got me the job, I had to be loyal and I owed him.

'He said there were women who didn't like the way I looked, his wife wouldn't like me because I was just his type, petite and blonde.

The court heard police traced the letters to Perryman and found drafts on his computer.

After his arrest he allegedly approached Mrs Titmarsh and threatened 'You don't know what's coming to you' while making a 'thumb across the throat' gesture.

After the guilty verdicts, Judge Nicholas Coleman adjourned sentencing until April 17, but warned Perryman to expect to be jailed.

He told him: 'I'm quite sure that you will continue to deny the allegations but I am satisfied the jury are entirely right in their decisions.'

He added that the only question relating to Perryman's sentence is how long he will be jailed for.

Perryman, of King's Lynn, Cambs., stood emotionless in the dock as the verdict was read to him.

He was released on bail with a tag and ordered to obey a night time curfew.

The Queen Elizabeth Hospital refused to confirm Perryman's employment status.

Director of Human Resources Gerry Dryden said: 'The Trust acknowledges the verdict of the court in respect of its employee Karl Perryman.

'The Trust will now carefully consider the verdict and take such steps as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.

'It would be inappropriate for the Trust to comment further on this case at this time.'
