A pitbull terrier that had been mauled by another dog and left to die in an alley in the bitter Chicago winter in sub-zero temperatures has undergone facial reconstruction surgery.

Named Flapjack by staff at Felines and Canines, the one-year-old pup was discovered emaciated and shivering near a dumpster with his bottom lip hanging from his jaw from an apparent bite-wound from another dog.

Flapjack was rescued by an Animal Care and Control Officer and brought to the local pound, where vets removed a portion of the infected, decaying tissue from his jaw.

Badly injured: Flapjack was left to die in the cold with a terrible injury to his face caused by another dog

His injuries were extreme and he required extensive reconstructive surgery. The puncture wounds to his face pierced the bone, severed an artery and removed the muscle from the bone.

'There's still this very barbaric level of animal abuse and neglect that's going on, and there's a total disregard for any respect for life,' Felines and Canines director Kelly Thompson told DNAInfo.

'We're talking historically cold temperatures, and it's not stopping people from taking these animals and tossing them outside.'

Handsome boy: His carers say Flapjack knew how good he looked after surgery and pranced around, showing off

Good-natured: Even with his painful condition Flapjack was friendly, curious and affectionate

It's possible Flapjack was used as bait for fighting dogs or was being trained to fight himself before he was abandoned.

'Somebody used him for something,' shelter executive director Abby Smith told DNAInfo. 'Those are bite marks... I just can't believe it.'

Flapjack underwent surgery last week and it went 'unbelievably well.' Staff at Felines and Canines shelter posted on Facebook that Flapjacks's jaw is in good shape.Vets wired his lower lip to his jaw temporarily and once he's healed and his stitches and wire have been removed, they expect he will have a perfectly normal mouth.

After surgery: Vets were able to salvage enough of Flapjack's lip and jowl to ensure his mouth will look almost completely normal when he heals

'We had tears in our eyes when we saw him this morning - he is SO happy and knows how good he looks. His whole body was wiggling his tail was wagging so hard and all he wanted to do was give us the biggest, happiest kisses!' reads the post.

Flapjack's surgery was paid for with a GoFundMe fundraising page.

His carers expect Flapjack will be recovered enough within a week to be ready for adoption.

The incredibly well-adjusted pup is extremely friendly to both people and other dogs and is looking for a loving family.
