A Boeing 747 which was transported in separate pieces along a motorway on Valentine's Day may have been on its way to a special forces training base where it will be used by elite soldiers to practise rescuing hostages from planes captured by terrorists.

The large jet caused travel chaos earlier this month when it was driven by police escort from Cotswold Airport in Kemble, Gloucestershire, down the A419 dual carriageway between Cirencester and Swindon.

At first the jumbo jet was believed to be on the way to a university studio for interior design students.

But now it has emerged that it may have been travelling to a hidden underground bunker in Herefordshire to  be used for training by the Who Dares Wins regiment.

A Boeing 747 seen being driven on the A419 between Cirencester and Swindon may have been on its way to a £10million hidden bunker for SAS training, where it may be used by soldiers to simulate hostage situations

People living nearby claim to have seen the plane arriving and Helen Keighley, director of quality and business at the Nottingham academy which was the jet's original believed destination, said it had not arrived there.  

Last April it emerged that the bunker, beneath the Herefordshire base of the SAS, was to be used by the elite force for training.

According to reports the £10million base is  large enough to contain jumbo jets so that soldiers can use them to practise how to deal with incidents where terrorists capture planes and hold dozens of hostages for ransom.

The appearance of the plane has led to speculation that the bunker may be near completion, as the UK steps up surveillance and anti-terror patrols in the wake of recent attacks in Paris.

Last week the plane was believed to be on the way to Nottingham but never arrived.

Instead, the lorries carrying it had parked overnight at Whitchurch at Ross-on-Wye and the plane was seen being driven through Hereford the next day. 

Villagers living near the top secret bunker in Herefordshire told the Western Daily Press they saw an aircraft going into the remote Pontrilas Army Training Area - believed to be around 16 miles from the well equipped bunker. 

The state-of-the-art facility was previously said to be being built below ground to reduce the threat of an Al Qaeda attack and also to cut the noise currently caused by explosions and constant rifle fire during exercises.

Because it is underground it is not able to be seen from the air or satellite surveillance. 

Last April it emerged the bunker will include firing ranges of 200 yards and special insulation to reduce the sound of bullets in the walls beneath the Herefordshire HQ that will make up the secret training base 

The bunker is said to contain 'kill rooms' designed to mimic real situations the forces may find themselves in 

It is also expected to contain kill rooms, designed to mimic the real buildings crack teams may one day have to fight in.The site has a 200 yard firing range and walls covered with rubber insulation to reduce the sound from gun fire and explosions.

Previous reports have confirmed plans for a passenger jet to be used on the site. 

The plane is set to be used at least once a week by the counter-terrorist team, which is on permanent standby to respond to any threat to national security, including hijack situations.

The bunker is said to be large enough to contain several of the aircraft, which measure 22 feet wide, 16ft 3ins high and is 137ft long.

The Boeing 747 was transported by police escort on February 14 and caused long tailbacks on the roads 

Despite being split into several parts the plane still took up two lanes of the motorway creating problems 

People living near the SAS base claimed to have seen a Boeing 747 arriving at the Pontrillas site 

On February 14 the Boeing 747 was cut into several pieces to be transported through Cirencester.

The front section and cockpit of the Jumbo' was loaded onto a large lorry as it was driven along the M4. The abnormally large load took up two lanes of the motorway, causing long tailbacks.

The Ministry of Defence declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.  A spokesman said: 'The MOD do not discuss any matters pertaining to UK Special Forces.’

The Pontrilas site was revealed as an SAS training ground during the inquest of Royal Marine commando Lance Corporal Gordon Campbell in 2007. He died after he fell 100ft from a helicopter during an exercise to practise a night attack.
