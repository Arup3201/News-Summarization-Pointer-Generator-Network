The body of a woman who had been missing for several days was discovered naked and covered in blood behind a warehouse in South Philadelphia Sunday afternoon.

The victim was identified by relatives as Crystal Goodwin, but police have yet to confirm this information, only describing her as a white female between the ages of 35 and 40.

The shocking discovery was made just before 2pm in the 1900 block of South Christopher Columbus Boulevard near the Columbus Commons shopping mall.

Tragic mom: Crystal Goodwin, pictured here with her young daughter in a pool in 2010, was discovered dead and covered in blood outside a warehouse in South Philadelphia Sunday 

A man came upon the woman's body lying in the weeds near the shopping center and called police. He said Crystal Goodwin had a large laceration on the right side of her rib cage, according to CBS Philly.

A responding paramedic pronounced Goodwin dead at the scene. As of Monday morning, there was no word on the woman's cause of death.

According to family members, Miss Goodwin had been battling drug addiction for years, and they are convinced she was murdered.

In a tragic twist, Goodwin's family members were on their way to the mall to pick up supplies for Thanksgiving when her body was discovered at 1.38pm dumped near a warehouse.

The relatives walked over to the police officers who arrived on the scene and showed them pictures of the missing woman and her tattoos, which turned out to be a match.

Just moments after the medical examiner's vehicle had removed Crystal Goodwin's battered body from the scene, her distraught mother pulled up outside the mall.

Resting place: A passerby came upon Goodwin's naked body lying in the weeds not far from the Columbus Commons mall 

‘Is it a girl? Is it a girl? Is it my daughter? No, no, don't tell,’ she screamed, according to Philly.com.

Lydia Callsen, the mother of Crystal Goodwin's boyfriend, said the couple have a young daughter together.

She added that Crystal, who had a long criminal record including theft and drug possession charges, had been released from prison only last Tuesday and disappeared the following day.

Investigators have not ruled Goodwin’s death a homicide yet, but her family believe that she was killed as a result of foul play.
