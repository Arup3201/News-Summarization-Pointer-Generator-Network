Small firms are being frozen out of the £80billion attempt to kick-start lending, the Bank of England warned yesterday.

Despite being the backbone of the economy and a major employer, they are not benefiting from the scheme the Bank is running with the Government.

The first major analysis into the ‘Funding for Lending’ initiative does show, however, that it has ‘significantly’ increased funding for large firms and homeowners wanting a mortgage.

Warning: The Bank of England has said that small firms are being frozen out of the £80billion attempt to kick start lending

But experts yesterday warned it was ‘worrying’ and ‘disappointing’ that small firms are being excluded when they are key to stopping Britain slipping back into recession.

The Daily Mail has consistently highlighted the plight of small businesses struggling to get the money to expand, launching our Make the Banks Lend campaign in July 2010.

Under the Funding for Lending scheme, banks and building societies can borrow an unlimited amount of money for as little as 0.25 per cent. But they have to maintain or increase their lending levels.

They must use the money to lend to those needing funds, including businesses of all sizes, homeowners or first-time  buyers needing a mortgage.

But the Bank’s latest ‘credit conditions’ survey, published yesterday, showed how lenders continue to have a separate rule book for small firms.

It said: ‘Overall, credit availability to the corporate sector was reported to have increased significantly [between September and December], the first reported rise in availability for a year.

‘This was reflected in a significant increase in availability for medium-sized firms, an increase in availability for large firms and a slight increase for small firms.’

The problem will continue, the Bank went on to warn.

It stated: ‘Looking ahead to January–March 2013, lenders expected a further increase in credit availability to the  corporate sector as a whole.

‘This mainly reflected an increase in credit availability for large and medium-sized firms.’

Chuka Umunna, the Shadow Business Secretary, expressed dismay at the report

To make matters worse, it said, interest rates, fees and commission charged by banks are not falling for small firms although they are for medium and large firms.

Chuka Umunna, the Shadow Business Secretary, expressed dismay at the report.

‘We need to ensure that entrepreneurs, those taking risks and creating jobs and growth, receive all the support they need, so that small businesses can grow, take on employees and drive growth,’ he said.

‘It is disappointing the Bank of England’s survey finds that small firms are still paying over the odds to access finance.’

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: ‘It is slightly worrying that it is the smaller companies that appear to be benefiting the least from the improving credit situation.’

Stewart Baird, managing partner of Stone Ventures, which invests in small firms, said: ‘Once again, this data confirms that funds are getting through to bigger businesses but not the smaller firms that need them most.’

Last month, Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, declared he was fed up with ‘the chronic lack of lending by the banks to our small businesses’.

He said: ‘This is hurting many successful companies and strangling growth.

‘As I go round the country, I am constantly meeting outstanding small businesses desperate to get credit from high-street banks – and  failing to do so. Something needs to be done.’

As well as the Bank lending scheme, the Government is giving money to ‘peer-to-peer lenders’, such as Funding Circle, which allow people to lend directly to firms.

A typical business borrows £60,000 from between 300 and 400 investors, who receive an average interest rate of 9.1 per cent.
