VENUS STANDS TALL AS RIVALS TUMBLE 

It has been a first round of unusual carnage among the women’s seeds but standing above it all is the remarkable Venus Williams, now 34.

More than 20 years after first appearing on tour, and after several years of health issues, she has quietly made it into the world’s top 20 and shows no sign of wanting to stop.

While a record-equalling 11 seeds fell at the first hurdle there was no danger she would be among them, gliding past Spain’s Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor 6-2, 6-2.

It is even more notable given since 2011 she has been battling the auto-immune disease Sjogren’s syndrome.

She is also studying business — and spent the off-season learning about accounting. For now she is concentrating on the second round, where she faces fellow American Lauren Davis.

Elsewhere, Novak Djokovic is through to the second round after beating Aljaz Bedene.

 WOZNIACKI THROUGH TO SECOND ROUND

Caroline Wozniacki earned a juicy second-round match against Victoria Azarenka, twice an Australian champion but unseeded due to last year’s injuries. 

But Liverpool fan Wozniacki seemed more preoccupied about Steven Gerrard’s impending departure. ‘I’ll probably have to make a trip to LA to see him again,’ she said.

BERDYCH POPS THE QUESTION

Tomas Berdych chose a strange time to announce on Tuesday that he is engaged to his girlfriend, the Czech model Ester Satorova. 

The world No 7 broke off from his preparations to pose for pictures with his fiancee in the beautiful botanical gardens close to Melbourne Park.

There has been little for Swedish backpackers to cheer here recently but a few were back to support their big hope for the future on Tuesday, 18-year-old Elias Ymer. The youngest qualifier, he lost in five sets to Japan’s Go Soeda.
