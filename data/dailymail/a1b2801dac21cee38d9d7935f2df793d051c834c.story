David Cameron has repeatedly claimed he has a ‘very clear vision’ for Britain.

But today the Prime Minister had to bow to a combination of growing old and the pressures of his job and admit he now needs glasses.

The new rimless specs, bought for £15 from Boots three months ago, were given their debut during an appearance in front of a committee of MPs, and immediately drew comparisons with Tony Blair.

Debut: It is the first time the glasses have been seen, even though Mr Cameron bought them in June

Mr Cameron wore the glasses to read his government briefings during a hearing of the liaison committee in Parliament.

He quickly took them on and off, leading some to speculate whether he was trying to avoid being caught on camera wearing them.

The Prime Minister later wrote on Twitter: 'Thanks to everyone who asked about my new glasses. I've actually had them since June - but today was the first public appearance.'

Mr Cameron's glasses are the latest sign the 46-year-old may be feeling his age, after abandoning jogging because of bad knees and growing his hair longer to cover up thinning patches.

Last month he complained of suffering a 'phenomenally bad back'.

It is understood he has had the glasses since June, and was helped by wife Samantha to choose them.

The rimless style is very similar to those chosen by former Prime Minister Mr Blair, who joked in 2001 that he was ‘coming out’ wore his pair for the first time in public.

The Labour leader said at the time: ‘Some things in life you have just got to accept. It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase vision for Britain.’

Mr Cameron was facing questions about Syria and civil service reform.

A source close to the PM said: ‘He had his eyes tested on June 13 and picked his glasses out, with the help of Sam, a few days later. He just felt his eyesight wasn’t quite as sharp.’
