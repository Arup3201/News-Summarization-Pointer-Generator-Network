While reporting on a top high school football recruiting event in Oregon, a FOX Sports newscaster got a little bit too close to the action.

Amy Campbell, a reporter for FOX Sports Next, was in the midst of interviewing recruiting analyist Chad Simmons when rising star footballer Ermon Lane came crashing into her on the sidelines.

Though Campbell later told the sports broadcasting network that she was unharmed, the entire incident was caught on video and as with many sports and news bloopers, has become an Internet sensation.

In the video, picked up by local television station ABC WPBF, Campbell is listening intently to Simmons speak when Ermon comes running up behind her at full speed to catch a pass.

Screams are heard as Campbell, Simmons, and Lane all take a tumble and drop off camera.

Though Simmons, who saw Lane coming at 
the last minute, tried to block Campbell, he was unable to stop the 
four-star wide receiver prospect.

At 6''2 Lane is a powerhouse, and though currently a rising senior at Homestead High School in Florida, weights 193 lbs. He is a highly sought after prospect for Universities such as Miami, Florida State or Florida, according to FOX Sports.

The collision happened at The Opening, a summer recruiting camp for the nation's top high school football players, which was held the the Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, according to the television report.

In the aftermath of the crash, which went viral on YouTube, Campbell told FOX Sports she was not injured.

Ball in play: While Campbell's attention is focused on her interview, behind her Lane (in white on the right hand side of the picture) begins to run in her direction to catch the football in midair

Closer: Lane (in white on the right), still with his eyes on  the ball (the black spot in the top right corner) speeds towards an unsuspecting Campbell still engrossed in her interview

'My knee got a little bit bruised,' she said to the sport network. 'It's sore today, but nothing serious. It could've been a lot worse. At least I can take a hit, right?'

Campbell told her network that the crash may have been captured on film, but was not the first incident that day.

'[Lane] has almost collided with me several times since I've been out here,' said, explaining that earlier in the day the high school football star narrowly missed her when he came out of the end zone.

Taking it in her stride, Campbell joked around about the incident on Twitter, tweeting 'I can take a hit #grind.'

She kept her good humor when one 
follower commented, 'I've watched this no fewer than 10 times in the 
past few minutes! LOL! Sorry,' to which she responded, 'It gets funnier 
every time.'

Campbell even posted a picture on the social media website of her and Lane after the collision with the caption 'Still friends!'

After Lane accidentally collided with Campbell on the gridiron she posted a photo with the footballer on Twitter, declaring 'Still Friends!' Campbell was luckily unharmed by the crash

Campbell
 told FOX Sports that her favorite part of the video was when the 
referee declares the pass completed, ignorant of the accident on the 
sidelines.

'That to me is just the icing on the cake right there,' she said.
