After taking urgent legal action, mining magnate Gina Rinehart will likely be allowed to watch the second episode of the Nine Networks controversial new program, House of Hancock, amid concerns about falsehoods and defamation.

Following a desperate bid to prevent the network from airing the second half of the program, Justice Peter Garling said that there was a real prospect the show would air statements that weren't entirely truthful- and perhaps even made up.

Justice Garling ordered the Nine Network to hand over a DVD of the episode- due to be broadcast on Sunday- after pointing to remarks made by entertainment reporter Peter Ford that the second episode made Ms Rinehart look like an 'obsessed, vindictive shrew'.

Mining magnate Gina Rinehart has taken urgent legal action in the NSW Supreme Court in a bid to stop the Nine Network from airing the second half of its program, House of Hancock, on Sunday night.

The episode is only allowed to be viewed by Ms Rinehart, her senior and junior counsel and a several solicitors.

Ms Rinehart's lawyers must inform the Nine Network if they are going to make an application to stop the broadcast of the show by 9.15pm. 

Ms Rinehart's barrister Tom Blackburn asked the NSW Supreme Court on Friday to grant an application that would allow her lawyers to view the program before it goes to air on Sunday night.

Her lawyers want to see if there are any grounds to seek an urgent injunction and prevent the second part of the series from airing. 

Mr Blackburn told the court about alleged inaccuracies in the first instalment and said the second episode was potentially malicious and defamatory.

He said the action was sparked when Nine's A Current Affair program ran a story promoting the upcoming episode.

'(It) gave my client cause for enormous concern about the likely ... honesty of that program,' he said. 

He said there was real concern about the 'severity of falsehood about to be broadcast'.

'Channel Nine knows that some of it is made up,' Mr Blackburn told the court.

The first episode of the two-part series aired last Sunday and dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart and her late father Lang Hancock.

It focuses on the romance between the Ms Rinehart's father and his Filipino housemaid Rose Lacson, which triggered the breakdown of Australia's Dynasty-style family when she became his third wife in 1985.

Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose. 

More than 1.4 million viewers tuned in for the first instalment last Sunday.

Mr Hancock and his daughter (pictured here in real life) had a strong relationship in the eighties, but it later deteriorated following his relationship with Rose 

Tad Watroba, executive director of Hancock Prospecting, issued a statement to Nine's network boss David Gyngell following the first episode saying it was 'tacky' and 'damaging the memory of good Australians'. 

He said many of the scenes aired were fictitious, unfounded or grossly distorted.

'I know the facts, and this show has turned out to be a tacky grab for ratings, damaging the memory of good Australians along the way,' Mr Watroba said.

'Since starting promotion of the show, Channel 9 has not bothered to fact-check anything despite repeated offers when people have pointed out mistakes. 

Scenes from the series showed Hancock (played by Sam Neil) having sex with housekeeper Rose Lacson (Peta Sergeant) and Rinehart discovering their affair.

'You're the subject of dirty old man jokes from one end of Australia to the next,' Ms Rinehart, who was played by Mandy McElhinney, says.

Her headstrong father retorts: 'You're the embarrassment, not me, you've let yourself go since having kids.. Look at the baby elephant you've become,' he barks.

Hancock, once Australia's richest man, was smitten with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap and pursues the relationship smashing the bond he shared with his only child.

What ensues is an increasingly bitter public feud spanning two decades involving murder accusations, drug charges, court cases, illegitimate children and betrayal until his death in 1992, aged 82. 

Among the alleged errors in House of Hancock, according to Mr Watroba, is the fact Mr Hancock and Ms Rinehart had a loving, father/daughter relationship.

Mr Watroba also said Ms Rinehart was very close to her mother and did not continue to holiday or honeymoon in the United States when her mother was dying as the show has suggested.

'Mr Hancock never told Mrs Rinehart that no one could ever love her, or that her husband never loved her. The scene was made up and untrue. Her relationship with Mr Frank Rinehart was very loving, and her mother loved her son-in-law also,' he said.

Rose was initially hired by Ms Rinehart to help her newly widowed father after her mother Hope Margaret passed away in 1983.

She went on to marry her boss two years later in 1985.

Ms Rinehart was bitterly opposed to the relationship and made a point of not attending the wedding in Sydney and even opposed Rose's business visa when she her father first began dating.

The mining heiress now remains locked in a bitter legal fight with three of her children, John, Bianca and Hope.

The trio are trying to remove their magnate mother from the position of trustee of the multi-million dollar family trust, set up by Hancock for his grandchildren in 1988.
