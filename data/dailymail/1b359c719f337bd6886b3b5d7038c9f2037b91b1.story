It seems every human in the world has taken part in the Ice Bucket Challenge, but none are as cute as this dog volunteer.

Buba the pooch joined in the trend and performed the challenge all by himself, with the help of an ingenious invention.

And his moment of glory was captured by owner Mr Gregor, who uploaded the video to YouTube.  

Puppy power: Buba prepares himself to get drenched. The mutt did his own Ice Bucket Challenge

Clever Buba prepares himself  for his watery adventure by busily sniffing around the wooden frame which he will stand under. 

The clever gizmo - a simple pulley system -  holds a small pot of water, held securely in place by a slim strap with notches on one end and a bottle of sand which acts as a weight, on the other.

What a soaking: The drenched the mutt leaps up on all fours as the liquid hits his fur

The bottle of sand balances precariously on a tiny see-saw, which can be dislodged easily with a gentle tap. 

Standing adorably on his hind feet, the cute pup places a paw on the see-saw, tipping over the bottle of sand.

As the bottle falls, the pot on the other side rises, immediately spilling its contents all over the pup.

Success: Adorable Buba gets lots of pets from his owner Mr Gregor as a reward for successfully completing his challenge

The drenched the mutt leaps up on all fours as the liquid hits his fur. 

But he seems to be enjoying the soaking and stands still, letting all the water pour out. 

The liquid trial over, Buba bounds away, vigorously shaking the remaining droplets of water from his fur. 

He is lavished with attention and pets after successfully completing his mission. 

Buba's Ice Bucket Challenge was well received on YouTube, as animal lovers praised him for taking part in the challenge. 

User Despina M. Andrelus said: 'This was absolutely precious! Thanks for showing that it can most definitely be done humanely and with much fun for our beloved animals, as well.'
