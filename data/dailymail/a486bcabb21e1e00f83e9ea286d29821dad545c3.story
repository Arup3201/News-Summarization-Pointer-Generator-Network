Dirty deed: Ronald Eugene Robinson, 34, was charged with tampering with consumer products on Thursday after police say he returned used enemas to a CVS store

As many as 12 used enema kits have been 
sold to unsuspecting customers at a CVS drug store in Florida after a man allegedly bought, used and returned them over a three month period.

On Thursday 34-year-old Ronald Eugene Robinson was indicted by a federal grand jury in Jacksonville for tampering with consumer products.

Police in Jacksonville said a CVS employee grew suspicious of Robinson in June after he was seen continually purchasing and returning the saline laxatives to the store.

After first seen purchasing the enemas in March and returning them in April it wasn't until June 5 that an employee closely examined one of Robinson’s returned boxes and found the products soiled inside.

Employees immediately checked additional boxes on the store shelf and found three more in the same condition.

The Florida Department of Health confirmed the bottles testing positive for faecal matter.

CVS says 21 customers have since been contacted after suspected of purchasing the products believed to have been resealed at the packages’ bottom with glue.

Robinson was arrested on June 15, three days after attempting to return another box of enemas purchased a day before on June 11.

Crime scene: Police say it was at this Jacksonville CVS pharmacy that Robinson purchased and returned the products between April and June

Used: A suspicious employee examined one of the saline laxative boxes returned by Robinson and after finding it used, found three more boxes in the same condition (some of the unused products pictured)

The return was denied by the store's manager who shared a warning with all other CVS stores in the area about their returns.

He was later identified and caught through the use of his credit card as well as an employee marking his vehicle's tag number.

'The health and safety of our customers is our top priority ... If a product appears to have been used or noticeably damaged we do not allow it back on the shelf,' CVS spokesperson Mike DeAngelis told First Coast News.

Today the drug store is further warning customers who may have purchased the enemas with a note in place of the shelf’s products, advising them to call a consumer hotline.

'I was just kinda shocked. But in 
today's economic times, like I said before, people are doing some 
strange things,' CVS customer Bob Robbins reacted outside the store to 
First Coast News.

If convicted Robinson faces up to 10 years in a federal prison and a $250,000 fine.

According to Robinson's Facebook 
profile, he's a mechanic and single father whose favourite movies 
include Ace Ventura and Step Brothers.

His interests also include 'potty training.'

Any motive for the alleged crime was not immediately released by police.
