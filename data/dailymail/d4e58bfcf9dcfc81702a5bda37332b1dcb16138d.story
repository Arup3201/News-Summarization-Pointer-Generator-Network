Four people were injured, including a stewardess who was hospitalized, after a North Carolina-bound plane hit severe turbulence and nose-dived in Florida yesterday.

Flight attendants were serving refreshments to 147 passengers about 4pm when the Allegiant Airlines aircraft suddenly dived several thousand feet in a matter of minutes.

A stewardess on drink service hit the ceiling and cut her head, before falling on a passenger and injuring him.

Another person suffered a leg injury after being struck by the drink cart, while the fourth who wasn't buckled in suffered neck pain, according to WTSP.

Injuries: Four people were injured, including a flight stewardess who was hospitalized, after severe turbulence caused an Allegiant Airlines plane to dive

Scene: Emergency crews attended to four injured people when Allegiant Airlines made an emergency landing about 4pm Monday at St. Pete/Clearwater Airport in Florida

WYFF4.com reported Flight 916 had reached its cruising altitude about 30 to 40 minutes after leading Fort Lauderdale International Airport when it hit extreme turbulence.

Officials said the seat-belt sign was illuminated while inflight refreshments were being served.

Terrified passengers told WTSP they thought they wouldn't survive the MD-83's unexpected dive.

'It felt like a bad roller coaster ride,' Jeff Adler of Hallandale, Florida, said. 'When you see those people flying up and down in a movie, that's basically what happened.'

He said the flight attendant 'took a beating' during the incident.

'She hit the ceiling and she had this gash on the side of her face. Actually she looked a little dazed,' he said.

Nicolas Harrington, the brother of one of the injured, said his brother was taken to hospital with neck injuries.

'He hit his head on the roof of the airplane,' Harrington said. 'He must of pulled some neck muscles or something because he's not really able to maneuver his head around.'

Waiting: About 150 Allegiant Airlines passengers had to steady their nerves and step back onto a plane Tuesday morning, hours after a flight many of them thought they wouldn't survive

The captain made an emergency landing at St. 
Pete-Clearwater International airport in Florida about 4.30pm, ABC News reported.

'The
 flight deck crew made the decision to divert the flight to St. 
Pete-Clearwater International airport following reports of injuries to 
both passengers and cabin crew,' the airline said in a statement.

Passengers were held at the gate for several hours before being told 
they would have to spend the night.

An Allegiant Air spokeswoman said the passengers received a $100 
voucher for future travel and were put up overnight in local hotels.

They had the option of boarding another flight to North Carolina this morning, fly back to Fort Lauderdale or get a refund.

She said a replacement aircraft and crew was sent to St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport to operate the flight while maintenance crews checked out the MD-83.
