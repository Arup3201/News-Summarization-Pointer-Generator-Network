A father of two who had longed to own a Harley Davidson for more than 40 years, was killed in a motorcycle accident as he drove his dream bike home from the shop.

Barry Strang, 59, was just easing into semi-retirement in Casper, Wyoming, when his wife, Pam, relented on the idea of him buying a Harley.

After putting up a Facebook post, proudly boasting of his new purchase, Mr Strang started his drive home, only to crash into a truck and die three miles into the ride.

His wife of 38 years said that when she heard sirens on the day he collected the motorcycle she feared for the worst, according to the Casper Star Tribune.

Mrs Strang, who had driven him to the bike store before heading off to another shop, was stuck in the traffic jam caused by her husband's crash on June 27.

She called her 
sister, who tried to assure her that it wasn't her husband, but Mrs Strang said she knew he had been killed. 'I felt him,' she said.

After leaving the shop in Lander, Mr Strang collided with the axle of a truck tractor on a bend and went under the truck's wheels.

He had been wearing a helmet but it flew off in the force of the crash, landing 30ft away. 

Sergeant Steve Townsend, of Wyoming 
Highway Patrol, said the crash could have been caused because Mr Strang 
was unfamiliar with his motorcycle, according to County 10.

'The
cause of the crash remains under investigation and troopers are 
investigating unfamiliarity with the motorcycle as a contributing 
factor. Strang had just purchased the motorcycle brand new and had 
driven a distance of 3 miles when he was involved in the crash,' he 
said.

Mrs Strang has remained philosophical about the crash, saying that her husband had lived his life to the fullest.

'It
was something he wanted his whole life. It’s like my son 
said, "Dad went out with the biggest smile on his face".'

She added that for years the couple 
would go out for dessert at Baskin-Robbins every Friday  and then window
shop at the Harley Davidson store next door.

Mr
Strang, who had two children, Justin 21, and Morgan, 17, and a 
granddaughter, had told her owning a Harley was on his bucket list.

The family, who were originally from California, had moved to Casper in 1988 to make the most of a rural life.

Although Mr Strang, who ran Quality 
Farms and Strang and Son Outfitters, had no farming or outfitting 
experience, he was a natural at both.

He had posted on Facebook that his son was taking over the farm so he could start retirement two days before buying his bike.

'He was a rancher by trade and an outfitter by passion,' his brother, Ron, who also lives in Casper said.
