Three students bravely subdued a classmate who went on a stabbing frenzy at a Houston community college today - and then promptly posted pictured of their heroism online.

The knife-man now charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon is Dylan Quick, 20, a fellow student suspected of knifing 14 people this morning at Lone Star College's Cypress campus.

Steven Maida, Erik Bertrand, Ryan Ballard and another student named James managed to wrestle the armed man to the floor and waited for law enforcement to arrive, KHOU.com reported.

And in a very modern take on heroism, Maida posted a picture of the suspect onto his Instagram account, explaining how he ran to intercept him as the stabbings began and then an hour later posted a congratulatory self-portrait of himself inside a police car after his bold act.

'I was walking back from the cafe and bookstore and I see people running different ways and I thought it was a tour.'

'Then I hear someone say my friend has been stabbed and then this girl walks out with a hole in her cheek.

'I said where's he at? Where's he at?'

'So I go inside, upstairs and as I do, another girl has a hole in her throat and I looked up at the staircase and there is blood on the staircase.

Rushing around the science block looking for the assailant, Maida and the others had the unidentified man pointed out to them by other frightened students.

'We ran outside but he was 100 feet in front of the security guards, but they were taking their time,' said Maida.

'He takes us through the building and almost loses us, but one girl said he went that way - we saw him, we chased him and we tackled him down.'

Explaining that the assailant held a knife, Maida told Fox News the weapon was out of sight.

While one student grabbed his back-pack Maida and James pulled him down by his arms, which caused him to scream out 'I give up, I give up'.

'His hands were in the air and he said ‘I give up.’ … I was screaming at this guy, I was just like, ‘Why!? Why would you do this to girls!?’

Maida said he wasn’t scared during the extraordinary attack.

'I don’t know why I wasn’t. I guess you grow up in Houston, you’re not scared of that kinda stuff.'

Ballard told the Houston Chronicle about how the group stopped the attacker.

'I'm a pretty big dude,' 6 feet 4 Ballard who weighs about 235 pounds told the newspaper.

'I pushed him down with my elbow and I had my knee on his back while he (student) was holding his face in the ground.'

'If we wouldn't have stopped him, who knows what he would have done?'

Police yesterday thanked the students for intervening.

'Some of the details in the call slip
did indicate that students or faculty were actively responding to work 
to subdue this individual,' said Harris County Sheriff Adrian 
Garcia.

'So we're proud of those folks, but we're glad no one else is injured any more severely than they are.

Sheriff's
deputies responded to 911 calls at just after 11 a.m. (12 a.m. ET) 
saying there was a suspect attacking people with a blade at the Lone 
Star college campus which is in the northwest of Houston.

12 people were 
rushed to hospital, including four people who were airlifted by 
helicopter - two of whom are still in a critical condition.

Students who heard the attack described the sound as like a rock concert and heard people scream out in pain.

According to one report from KHOU.Com, one of the stabbed students was 'bleeding profusely.'

Confirming
the randomness of the attack, one member of the Harris sheriff's 
department said that the assailant had no clear motive at this time.

'The
attack was at random,' said Harris County deputy Thomas Gilliland. 'It 
was the same suspect going from building to building.'

Student Maya Khalil, 19,
was in class in the campus' health sciences building when the incident 
happened, she said. She managed to take photos of the chaotic scene as 
it unfolded.

'It was really scary,' said Khalil.

One student who was trying to exit the campus said one of her classmates was stabbed.

'I
had just left class out of the HSC [Health Science Center] building, 
and as we were leaving we saw the cops coming. I called to check on 
another classmate who was still inside the building and she said the 
classroom was on lock-down and she said one of the classmates had been 
stabbed,' said Margo Shimfarr-Evans.

'It happened in the hallway, we 
have a lab and lecture, and down the hallway it's all lab classes and a 
classmate in the lab class got stabbed.'

Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center said it had two patients in critical condition and six in all, including four flown there by helicopter. A spokeswoman for another hospital, North Cypress Medical Center, said it had taken six stabbing victims who were in stable condition.

Two other victims were treated at the scene and declined to be taken to the hospital, the sheriff said.

The attack began at about 11.15 a.m. at the rear of the Health Sciences Building on the Cy-Fair campus on Barker Cypress Road.

The school went on lock-down after initial reports there was a second assailant - 
but Harris County Sheriff's spokesman Alan Bernstein said he was sure that one one suspect acted alone.

'The initial reports said we have two suspects, but what I believe now 
is it was the same person running from building to building,' a police 
spokesman said at a press conference.

At around 2 p.m., Marianna Sviland, a teacher at the community college said that students and staff were being allowed back into the school.

The school then closed for the day and will reopen on Wednesday.

Lone
Star posted an alert on its website just before 12 p.m. warning 
students of two armed suspects and saying one person remains at large. 
The alert warned people to seek shelter in a secure location.

Student Teaundrae Perryman said he was in class when he received a 
text message from a friend and went outside to see a young woman being 
loaded into an ambulance with what appeared to be stab wounds to either 
her neck or head.

'I was concerned but I wasn't afraid 
because I was with a large group of people,' the 21-year-old said, later
adding,

'The police got to the scene very quickly.'

Courtland Sedlachek, 18, was in 
class when his phone started buzzing along with the phones of everyone 
else in class.

The room was temporarily locked down, but students were 
let out and off campus a short time later, in what Sedlachek described 
as an orderly evacuation.

He described his reaction as a 'little bit of nervousness.'

The school has approximately 90,000 students spread over more than a dozen campuses.

A
different Lone Star system campus was the site of a January shooting. 
Two people were wounded, and a 22-year-old man was charged with 
aggravated assault.
