Real Madrid have released a new black third kit, which the Champion League winners will wear in Europe when defending their crown.

The new kit, designed by Yohji Yamamoto, bears a 'dragon king' - which 'symbolizes the greatness, glory and power of the club' - and also a 'dragon bird' - which 'represents the clubs resistance, determination and agility on its way to the victory', according to Adidas.

Carlo Ancelotti's side are bidding the first team in the history of the Champions League to retain their title, which they won after beating neighbours Atletico Madrid 4-1 in May.

Atletico did manage to get some small revenge over the local rivals when they beat them in the Super Copa. 

After a 1-1 draw in the first leg at the Bernabeu, where James Rodriguez and Raul Garcia got their names on the score-sheet, Diego Simeone's men won 1-0 at home. New signing Mario Mandzukic began where Diego Costa left off and scored the winning goal.

Real began their league campaign with a win, though. They beat newly-promoted side Cordoba 2-0 at home, thanks to goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.
