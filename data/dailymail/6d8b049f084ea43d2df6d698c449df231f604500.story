Republican Mitt Romney dumped Chris Christie as a potential presidential running mate last year after discovering 'potential landmines' in his background checks, according to a new book.

Romney’s lawyers prepared a secret 35-page report which revealed Christie frequently overspent on official trips, steered government contracts to allies and had been sued for defamation.

Now there are fears the explosive revelations could hurt the New Jersey Governor's re-election chances on Tuesday, even though he is a frontrunner for the job.

Vetting issues: A new book has revealed that Mitt Romney (left) didn't ask Chris Christie (center) to be his candidate for vice president in 2012 because of 'potential landmines' in his health and background checks

The shocking details leaked from 51-year-old Christie's vetting file are revealed in journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's tell-all book, Double Down: Game Change 2012.

The book claims Romney included Christie on his shortlist of five possible candidates, impressed by the governor's forthrightness and ability to connect with voters.

However, 'controversies lurking in the shadows of his record' put Romney off and he scrapped him.

'The dossier on the Garden State governor’s background was littered with potential land mines,' the authors wrote, according to Swampland.

Vetters were concerned after discovering a 2010 Department of Justice inspector general’s investigation of Christie’s spending patterns in his job prior to the governorship.

The report criticized him for being 'the U.S. attorney who most often exceeded the government [travel expense] rate without adequate justification' and for offering 'insufficient, inaccurate, or no justification' for stays at lavish hotels.

They were also concerned that Christie worked as a lobbyist on behalf of the 
Securities Industry Association when Bernie Madoff was a 
senior SIA official and sought an exemption from New Jersey’s Consumer 
Fraud Act.

Christie’s decision to steer hefty government 
contracts to donors and political allies like former Attorney General 
John Ashcroft, which sparked a congressional hearing, was considered a 'landmine'.

The
authors also explained that Christie, who is widely seen as a top candidate 
among Republicans for 2016, left unanswered questions about a defamation
lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career.

The book also claimed Christie avoided information about a
Securities and Exchange Commission settlement involving his brother, Todd Christie, who acknowledged making 'hundreds of trades in which 
customers had been systematically overcharged.'

All of that was on top of a litany of glaring matters that concerned Romney and his team.

These included Christie’s other lobbying clients, his 
investments overseas, the YouTube clips which called into doubt his presidential temperament, his tardiness and his weight. 

The book claimed Romney, who once boasted about running three miles a day, often mocked the governor over his size.

'Romney marveled at Christie's 
girth,' according to the book. 'Watching a video of Christie without his
suit jacket on, Romney cackled to his aides "guys! Look at that"'.

Romney's search for a vice-presidential nominee was codenamed 'Project goldfish', but Christie was given the name 'Pufferfish' because of his size.

'Double Down' provides an explosive account of the 2012 presidential election campaign

Meanwhile, Christie has branded the vetting forms 'intrusive', saying the 
Romney campaign expected him to complete 75 pages.

'Asked about stuff with your kids, and
issues with your children, obviously criminal record, mental health 
issues drinking history, drug history,' he told Dan Balz for 'Collision 
2012'. 'All intrusive stuff.'

In a separate statement, he said he 'complied fully with the Romney campaign’s request for 
documents in a timely manner'.

However, it appears the portly Governor did his own form of vetting on Romney's campaign team.

He once called them a 'gaggle of 
clowns who couldn't organize a one-ring circus'.

And when he came under fire for his RNC speech, claims the book, Christie
confronted Ron Kaufman, a Romney aide, and screamed: 'I'm tired of you 
people!!! Leave me the f***k alone!!!!'

Meanwhile, Romney has tried to distance himself from the book's startling revelations.

This morning, he said Christie was 'one of the strongest lights' of the GOP and dismissed 'potential land mines' detailed in Double Down as old news.

'At
this stage you look at Chris Christie and say that’s a very impressive 
guy with a great track record, with a demonstrated ability to work 
across the aisle, with support of labor and blue-collar voters in New 
Jersey,' Romney said on Meet the Press, according to NJ.com.

'Chris Christie stands out as one of the very strongest lights of the Republican Party.

'Frankly,
there was nothing they found that wasn’t already part of the public 
record and that hadn’t already been dealt with effectively by Governor 
Chris Christie. So there was nothing new there.'

Christie released a medical summary last week showing he is in generally good health aside from high blood pressure and asthma controlled by medication.
