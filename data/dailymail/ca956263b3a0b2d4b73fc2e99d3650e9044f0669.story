A man suspected of murder is on the run after he was mistakenly released from jail because of a paperwork mix-up, it has emerged.

Police are now hunting for Quinton Jones after he walked straight out of the front door of Fulton County Jail two weeks ago.

He had been charged with the death of Lamarice Westbrook, 29, who was found dead at a concert venue in Atlanta in June 2011.

His murder trial was due to start on Monday morning. But Jones, who was being held without bond at the jail, did not arrive at the courthouse, which was filled with more than 40 of Mr Westbrook's friends and family.

Speaking to MyFoxAtlanta.com, Mr Westbrook's sister said: 'My brother will never walk this earth again and he's walking around free as if he did nothing.'

The mix-up has led to an argument between the Fulton County Sheriff's Office and the district attorney, who both disagree on who is responsible.

The sheriff's office said jail staff released the murder suspect based on court orders.

'The Fulton County Jail received court papers indicating that Mr. Jones case status was nolle prosequi [unwilling to prosecute] and dead docketed.'

However, District Attorney Paul Howard said his office filed the correct paperwork.

'Jail officials released Defendant Jones on the basis of the Dead Docketed, or original indictment, instead of holding him on the newest indictment in the system, Mr Howard said.

A warrant has now been issued for the arrest of Jones.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
