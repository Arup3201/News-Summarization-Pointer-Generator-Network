Sebastian Vettel's career with Ferrari is off to an encouraging start, with the German driver quickest in Formula One pre-season testing for the second day running.

The four-time champion joined Ferrari after a miserable season with Red Bull last year. The German finished fifth overall, failed to win a race and secured only four podium finishes compared to 13 Grand Prix wins the previous season.

Vettel clocked a best lap of 1 minute, 20.984 seconds on Monday - almost two seconds better than he managed on Sunday.

Defending champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth fastest in Mercedes and cut short his session about an hour before the end.

Meanwhile, Red Bull principal Christian Horner has revealed that the team's 'camouflage' car was inspired by Vettel.

The black-and-white livery design is visually refractive, ensuring rivals face a tough time trying to ascertain the car's aerodynamics. 

Horner has conceded the idea was spawned by Vettel's helmet design seen over the course of the Italian Grand Prix weekend last year.

Horner said: 'Seb's helmet was quite fun, so we thought it would be interesting to extend that concept to the rest of the car.

'Dietrich (Mateschitz, owner) liked it when he saw it, and it epitomises Red Bull that we like to do things a bit differently.

'To see a Red Bull in a different livery is striking and it makes it difficult to get detailed photographs of the car, as it confuses the eyeline, at a time of year when we're all trying to be as secretive as we possibly can.

'But it's obviously had a great reaction.
