They have waited 24 years to get their hands on the World Cup again and in little over a week of it being in their possession, Germany have damaged the iconic trophy.

The 2014 tournament winners have chipped off a piece of their golden prize admist wild celebrations after their 1-0 extra-time win against Argentina in the final earlier this month.

On Sunday, the German FA revealed the damage as captain Philip Lahm led the team in jubilant scenes after the Germans won football's most famous competition for the first time since 1990 in Brazil's Maracana stadium.

But the president of the country's football association, Wolfgang Niersbach, said a piece of the famous gold trophy was later 'chipped off' as the players showed it to fans back home.

He told Die Welt: 'At one point, a small piece of our World Cup trophy was chipped off. But do not worry, we have specialists on the case who can fix it.

'We have investigated persistently who it was that damaged the trophy, but the investigation was concluded without a result.'

The trophy, designed by Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga, was introduced in 1974 and the 5kg original, made from 75 per cent 18 carat gold, is said to be worth around £8million.

Luckily for Germany however, the trophy they were given to parade around Berlin was a replica given to them by football's governing body, Fifa.

The current trophy replaced the famous Jules Rimet trophy, which was given to Brazil after they won it for a third time at the 1970 World Cup.

The previous trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall ahead of the 1966 World Cup in England.

It was then famously found by a dog named Pickles under a bush in Norwood, south London before England went on to win the tournament.

It's not the first time that a team's celebrations have led to a trophy being damaged.

In 2011, Sergio Ramos famously dropped the Copa del Rey beneath Real Madrid's team bus as they celebrated through the streets of the Spanish captial in an open top bus parade.

The jubilant scenes got all too much for Ramos who, as he balanced the giant 15kg piece of silverware on his head, somehow let loose his grip and dropped the cup beneath the wheels of the bus.

The Spain international later claimed the trophy was 'ok', but television pictures showed emergency services gathering up the broken pieces and returning them to the team on board. The cup was then absent from the traditional celebration spot of the Plaza de Cibeles in central Madrid.

In 2012, three members of Chelsea staff were suspended after the Champions League trophy was damaged.

One of the handles was left hanging off after the three security personnel posed for pictures with the trophy to show off to friends.

The Champions League winners immediately sent the trophy to a London silversmith for emergency repairs following the incident at Stamford Bridge, which happened when the staff were outside their normal shift hours.

A year later, the FA Cup underwent some careful TLC after it was damaged by the Blues - who were the current holders at the time.

The £3,000 worth of repairs took around 70 to 80 hours of restoration and polishing by silversmith Kevin Williams before Wigan's shock Wembley triumph against Manchester City.
