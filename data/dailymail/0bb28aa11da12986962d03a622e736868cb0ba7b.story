A Connecticut teen has died after he was fatally shot in the head and leg by an unknown assailant on Saturday night.

Kristjan Ndoj, 15, died on Thursday morning at Bridgeport Hospital, after several days on life support.

The shooting happened after Ndoj, a sophomore at Shelton High School in Connecticut, is alleged to have received death threats for talking to a girl.

Kristjan Ndoj, 15, died on Thursday morning at Bridgeport Hospital, several days after he was shot in the head and leg

Ndoj was on his bike when the shooting happened and his body was found in the driveway at about 8:45 p.m. Saturday.

Police believe the shots came from a wooded area near the home and neighbors said he had been visiting a female friend.

Shortly before he was shot, Ndoj had received a text from a girl – believed to be a classmate – which said, ‘My boyfriend is going to kill you’, a relative told WTNH.

Friend and fellow student Anthony Franco confirmed to WTNH that Ndoj had been warned by the unnamed girl’s boyfriend ‘that if he hangs out with her or talks to her anymore, there's going to be problems.’

Franco said he couldn't believe Ndoj might have been targeted.

‘This hasn't happened to Shelton in a long time,’ he said. ‘And to happen to a great kid like that, it's just shocking because no one would think he had enemies or he had anybody that wanted to hurt him.’

Investigators are aware of the threats that allegedly were made, but Lt. Robert Kozlowsky, Shelton Police Department, said he would not comment on potential suspects.

The death is now being investigated as a homicide, the first in the city since 1996.

‘Obviously this is a very somber time… for the entire Shelton community,’ Shelton Public Schools Superintendent Freeman Burr said at a news conference on Thursday.

Dr. Beth Smith, headmaster of Shelton High School, said that students and parents were informed of the death Thursday afternoon and counselors are on hand.

An attorney for Ndoj's family says the teen will always be remembered as a bright boy with natural athletic ability and wisdom beyond his years.

“The family wants to thank their Shelton neighbors," he said, "as well as all those who offered their kind and thoughtful expressions of love and support toward Kristjan and his family."

The 15-year-old is survived by his mother, father and brother.

Friends of the family started an online fundraising page and had raised more than $17,000 in just two days.
