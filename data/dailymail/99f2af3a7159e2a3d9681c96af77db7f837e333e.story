A former EastEnders extra who battered an 86-year-old widow to death in her own home before stealing her jewellery and pawning it for just £61 has today been jailed for a minimum of 24 years after pleading guilty to her murder.

Bit part actress and Ocado delivery driver Karen Williamson, 46, smashed frail Jean Jobson repeatedly in the head and face with a hammer and heavy glass jug until her 'skull literally collapsed,' the Old Bailey heard.

The 'gruesome killing' of the 'vulnerable lone old lady,' known as Pat, was only discovered two days later when family and friends alerted police after being unable to contact her.

Police broke into Mrs Jobson's home 
in Bromley, south-east London, to find her dead body and the phone left 
off the hook last February.

Judge Paul Worsley QC told 
Williamson: ‘No doubt those remaining years for [Mrs Jobson] were doubly
precious. You took them from her despite her age.

‘She was an independent, caring member of the community, much loved by her family.

‘The family of Pat Jobson have had to wait a very long time to see justice in this case.

‘The attack which you carried out was sustained and brutal. Under the influence of crack you carried out a frenzied attack.

‘You used a hammer which broke in the course of its use and you used a 
heavy glass jug to hit her repeatedly. There is also some evidence of 
manual strangulation.

‘Pat Jobson, despite her age, put up a valiant fight against you as she 
tried to protect herself from your blows. The evidence against you was 
overwhelming.’

Mrs Jobson's purse and jewellery, including 
her late husband’s wedding ring on a chain she wore around her neck, were stolen by mother-of-one Williamson, a crack addict who worked as a
'casual' gardener for her.

Williamson,
an extra on EastEnders who has also appeared on ITV’s The Bill, then 
pawned the stolen jewellery for just £61 and hid the stolen purse in a 
drain yards from her own front door.

In
a victim impact statement, Mrs Jobson’s nephew Mark Montgomery said: 
'We can’t express the anger we feel towards the person responsible for 
Pat’s horrific murder.

'My entire family are bewildered as to how this ever occurred, especially to Auntie Pat who was loved and respected by so many. 

'She was in good health for her age and in no way deserved to have her life cut short in such a cruel and despicable manner.'

The judge said he had concluded this was a ‘murder for gain’ and deserved a higher minimum term.

He told Williamson: ‘I am satisfied you had not gone there to steal but when you got to the house you made up your mind that you would steal.

‘You clearly intended that she die. You stole her jewellery. Two days 
later you took it to a pawn shop. You got a paltry £61 for it.’

The judge said that Williamson’s 
crack cocaine habit ‘may well have released your inhibitions but it does
not mitigate what you did.’

Earlier prosecutor, Brian Altman QC, told the jury: 'The manner of the killing of this elderly woman in the sanctity of her own home defies belief because of its nature and savagery.

'Her killer had set about her with a 
hammer and heavy glass jug striking her several times to the head and 
face so hard and so often it quite literally caused her skull to 
fracture and collapse.

'She died from head injuries, the injuries from forced and repetitive blows injured the brain within.

Mr
Altman then explained how the pair had had a 'disagreement' on the 
night of Friday February 18 and into the next morning when Williamson 
'viciously attacked and killed her'.

He
added: 'As a measure of the defendant’s callousness and indeed 
desperation at the time of the killing, she stole several items of 
jewellery from Mrs Jobson as well as her purse and other personal 
effects.

'Within days 
this defendant was to sell the items of jewellery she had taken from her
dying victim for a paltry £61 at a pawn broker.'

Although childless, Mrs Jobson always
kept dogs and in the weeks before her murder she took in a homeless 
Staffordshire bull terrier after her elderly Labrador dog had to be put 
down.

Williamson, who lived nearby with her 17-year-old son, was arrested at the Ocado depot where she worked and initially denied any knowledge of the murder.

But
when re-arrested a week later, 'contrary to the lies she told before' 
she told detectives she had thrown Mrs Jobson’s purse down a drain yards
from her front door in Bromley.

She also confessed details about the case which only the true killer could have known to other people, including a prison guard and a friend.

Williamson pleaded guilty on the third day of her trial.
