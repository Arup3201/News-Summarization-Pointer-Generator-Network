Vincent Kompany hasn't given up hope of Manchester City qualifying from their Champions League group despite their catastrophic 2-1 defeat to CSKA Moscow on Wednesday night.

Seydou Doumbia scored twice to send nine-man City bottom of Group E. Red cards for Yaya Toure and Fernandinho mean they will miss the clash with Bayern Munich, but Kompany believes qualification is still a possibility.

The Belgium international Tweeted: 'When no one believes anymore it's my role to still believe. Thanks for the great support today. #MCFC #UsAgainstTheWorld #KeepTheFaith.'

Vincent Kompany says he still believes Manchester City can qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League

The Belgian centre-back said it was his job to remain positive when nobody else was 

His opinion wasn't shared by all, though. Graeme Souness was particularly scathing in his verdict of Manuel Pellegrini's side. 

Speaking on Sky, he said: 'A short few months ago we were talking about these players being world class but we can tell now that they're not world class because world class players respond and these players have been found wanting.'

'You get the early warning and after that you get yourself back into it, you think it's going to be one way.

'But they were second to everything. There's no argument - the best team won tonight regardless of the sendings off.'
