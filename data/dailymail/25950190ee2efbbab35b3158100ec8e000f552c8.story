Liverpool legend John Aldridge has heaped praise on Reds keeper Simon Mignolet, insisting the Belgian has been the club's most consistent performer in 2015.

Mignolet came under fierce criticism earlier in the season following a number of high-profile mistakes, with him subsequently getting dropped for Brad Jones.

However, the 26-year-old has impressed on his return to the starting 11 following an injury to the Australian - keeping five clean sheets in his last nine games in all competitions.

Aldridge told the Liverpool Echo: 'He (Simon) had some dark days earlier in the season, but Mignolet has been a shining light in the last month. 

'In fact, I think he's been Liverpool's best, most consistent player since the turn of the year. 

'He was excellent against Palace, and deserves huge credit for turning around his season so spectacularly.

'I've always been a fan of his, even when he was struggling. And it's great to see him back to his best.'

The Reds have been on an impressive run of form - losing just one of their last 16 games in all competitions - and now lie just four points off fourth-placed Southampton as they eye a Champions League spot for next season.
