It's Chelsea, but not as we know it. Dynamic, inventive and exuberant, Jose Mourinho’s new-look team have ripped up their overused ‘How to win’ manual and begun work on a new book.

With Cesc Fabregas as the author, the latest chapter in Chelsea Football Club’s meteoric rise looks sure to make compelling reading. The London club lived up to their billing as early-season title favourites with a tantalising display of attacking football in Monday’s 3-1 win at Burnley.

It was breathtaking at times — Andre Schurrle’s goal alone was worth the entrance money.

Dream team: Jose Mourinho has constructed a new-look Chelsea side in his second coming at the Bridge

The silk: Chelsea's side have the creative passing characteristics of Barcelona

... and the steel: The Blues also have the physical resilience of Wimbledon's Crazy Gang

With 37 games games still to go you will struggle to see an assist as delicious as Fabregas’s to set up the German World Cup winner for Chelsea’s second of the night.

We wondered if Fabregas could still cut it in England. In that moment, we got the answer. His two debut assists were merely the icing on the cake, though. It was the way he dictated Chelsea’s play and tempo that caught the eye. 

Of course, his nine years at Arsenal helped; there will be no settling in period for him. His sixth sense of when to inject pace into Chelsea’s passing or take the foot off the gas was all too apparent at Turf Moor.

You just wonder what Arsene Wenger, or even David Moyes, were thinking when watching the Spaniard’s display. And in Nemanja Matic, Fabregas has a midfield monster of a partner who can provide him with the platform to cause destruction.

Beauty: Cesc Fabregas' exquisite passing orchestrated play from midfield

... and the Beast: Nemanja Matic offered a perfect foil for Cesc Fabregas with his tough tackling

Mourinho said: ‘Fabregas and Matic controlled the game, the intensity of the game, they were choosing how to play; when to increase pace and decrease pace.

‘Last season we couldn’t control the game in the way we controlled it today. Fabreags was our first choice for that position. I know clearly the player he is because we have spent so many years in the same league, here in England, then he moved to Spain.

‘He’s giving exactly what we need, that stability, that quick thinking in midfield, the right intensity of the game. He brings other people in the same direction.’

Striker light: Jose Mourinho did not select a true No 9 in his first away game last season

The counter-argument, of course, is that this was the first game of the season, against a newly-promoted team. And, yes, that should be taken into account. But the signs are ominous for the rest of the Premier League.

Remember that attacking football and Chelsea haven’t always gone hand in hand. Too often they have relied on sheer power to get them over the line.

Indeed, it was only this time last year when Mourinho took his side to Old Trafford and started the game without a recognised striker. Now, 12 months on, and Mourinho’s team look transformed. But that’s not to say Chelsea have forgotten how to rough it.

Missing link: Spain international Diego Costa is the striker that Chelsea were missing last season

Diego Costa scored on his debut against Sean Dyche’s side but, perhaps, more importantly showed an appetite for a fight. John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Matic will not pull punches either.

In many ways, it’s Roman Abramovich’s dream. A team with the beauty of Barcelona’s tiki-taka and the brute force of the 1980s Wimbledon. Mix it all together and you could have this season’s title winners.
