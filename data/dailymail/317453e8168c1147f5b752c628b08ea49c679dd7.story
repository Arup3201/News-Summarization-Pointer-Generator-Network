We always knew the Americans were big tippers, but it seems they are being given a run for their money by the Germans.

A new survey has found that 60 per cent of US tourists say they always leave a tip on holiday, with nearly half of Germans saying the same.

But when it comes to leaving a gratuity, it seems the British aren't quite so generous, coming nearly bottom in research conducted in eight key countries.

Top tippers: Americans came top of a new poll by travel website TripAdvisor

Americans – 60 per centGermans – 49 per cent Brazilians – 33 per centSpanish – 30 per centRussians – 28 per centBrits – 26 per centFrench – 15 per centItalians – 11 per cent

TripAdvisor asked more than 25,000 people from eight 
countries: Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, the United 
Kingdom and the United States, whether they tipped when on holiday.

And while the US led the way with almost two thirds of people polled leaving money 
for staff, just a quarter of Britons said they did the same.

Of the 40 percent of US respondents who don’t always leave a tip on vacation, the main reasons for not tipping include: service didn’t meet their expectations (55 per cent), while 20 per cent think the tip is included in the bill.

Of the eight countries quizzed the Italians came bottom with just 11 per cent, and France doesn't do much better, with just 15 per cent of people saying they tip.

Paying the bill: 60 per cent of Americans polled always left a tip on holiday compared to an average of 27 per cent in the seven other countries surveyed

Surprisingly the Brazilians and Spanish came out as generous tippers, with even the Russians beating Britain.

The poll 
found 56 percent of Americans think tipping is ‘expected,’ but a quarter
 say they are often unsure what is appropriate across the globe.

A huge 97 per cent of Americans tip for 
restaurant service, with 79 per cent saying they also tip bellmen.

A further 73 per cent add a tip to room
 service, and 69 per cent leave a gratuity for housekeeping.

Brooke Ferencsik, director of communications for TripAdvisor, said: 'The TripAdvisor survey shows the majority of US travellers tip on vacation, regardless of the quality of service.

'While friendliness and helpfulness are the most important qualities that influence tipping behavior, cultural norms are also a significant factor.'

It is often American celebrities who usually hit the headlines for their generous tips too. Barack Obama, Charlie Sheen, Johnny Depp, Dan Ackroyd and Drew Barrymore have all be praised for the generous gratuities they have left for staff.
