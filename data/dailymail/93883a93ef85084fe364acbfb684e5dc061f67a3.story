A Royal Bahamas Defense Force spokesman says the death toll may reach 30 in the capsizing of a sailboat packed with migrants from Haiti.

Lt. Origin Deleveaux says Bahamian authorities have confirmed that at least 20 people died when the boat flipped over near Staniel Cay.

Deleveaux tells The Associated Press that five bodies had been recovered by late Tuesday afternoon with the aid of the U.S. Coast Guard. He says they are trying to recover more by nightfall.

Interviews with migrants suggest the toll could reach about 30 people. The overloaded sailboat apparently struck a reef and capsized near tiny Harvey Cay, west of Staniel Cay in the Exumas.

About 110 were thought to be on the boat, including 19 women.

At sea: Approximately 100 Haitians sit on the hull of a 40-foot sail freighter after it grounded and capsized and await rescue near the Bahamas in the Caribbean Sea, At least 10 Haitian migrants are reported dead

Risky business: Haitian migrants often head to the Bahamas or pass by on their way to the United States. The US Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamian Defense Force were at the scene

Overloaded: It is not clear whether the migrants were heading to the Bahamas or if their final destination was the US

Low-resolution photos taken by the 
U.S. Coast Guard during a rescue operation showed about 100 people on 
the boat, clinging to every available space on the overturned vessel 
east of Staniel Cay in the Bahamas.

The bodies of three of the migrants had been recovered but people on board the vessel said they believe about 30 had drowned, Deleveaux said.

The Bahamian Defense Force planned to continue sweeping the area for survivors or the remains of migrants and would then take them to a military base on the island of New Providence, he said. Most will likely eventually be sent back to Haiti.

Some of the migrants were treated for dehydration, including about a dozen airlifted from by the U.S. Coast Guard.

U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss called the capsizing an 'avoidable tragedy,' that has become common in this area.Â 

Dangerous crossing: Fatal accidents at sea involving migrants from Haiti, the Western hemisphere's poorest nation, are not uncommon. In December 2011, 38 migrants were found dead after their boat sank just off the eastern tip of Cuba

No surprise: In 2009, US Coast Guard officials called off their search for about 70 migrants from Haiti whose boat capsized off the Turks and Caicos Islands

Rescue: Dramatic Coast Guard photos from the scene showed the vessel tilted almost completely over on its side, with passengers tightly packed and holding on. Some sat on the gunnels and others climbed the mast

'Unfortunately we see these types of tragedies occur on a monthly basis,' said Doss, a Coast Guard spokesman. 'Every year we see hundreds of migrants needlessly lose their lives at sea taking part in these dangerous and illegal voyages.'

The boat struck ground off Harvey Cay, just weat of Staniel Cay, which is about 80 miles (125 kilometers) southeast of New Providence, the island that includes the capital of Nassau.

The boat, in addition to being overloaded, likely encountered rough water, Deleveaux said.

Migrants have long passed through the Bahamian archipelago in overloaded vessels, generally either seeking to settle in the Bahamas or reach the nearby United States.
