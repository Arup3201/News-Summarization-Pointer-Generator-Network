Men who drive blue BMWs are more likely to be aggressive than motorists in any other car, a study claims.

And the peak time for drivers to get angry is 5.45pm on a Friday as they fight the rush-hour – followed by the dismal Monday morning commute.

The likeliest road rage culprits are men aged 35-50 with blue BMW cars, the study of 2,837 motorists found. Drivers also reported run-ins with owners of Land Rovers, Audis, Subarus and Vauxhalls.

Blue was seen as the most aggressive colour, followed by black, silver, green and red.

Men said they lost their temper behind the wheel seven times a month on average, while women got angry on only three occasions.

Drivers most often expressed road rage
 by shouting and swearing, followed by erratic driving and obscene 
gestures, the study for discount website VoucherCodesPro revealed.

The poll also found, unsurprisingly, 
that Monday morning and Friday evening proved to be the most stressful 
times, when motorists are queuing to get to and from work.

Motorists were asked the pick the make
 and colour of car from which they have experienced the most incidents 
of road rage - and blue BMWs came out on top.

George Charles of VoucherCodesPro 
said: ‘During peak periods of traffic, whether it be the Monday morning 
school run or the hectic rush hour on a Friday evening, it is all too 
easy to allow the common manifestations of road rage to get the better 
of us as motorists.

‘This research, although slightly humorous in some of its findings, does indicate an important point.

‘Road rage is not something to be 
taken lightly and these results show that many motorists need to remind 
themselves that sometimes losing your temper whilst driving can result 
in serious altercations, assaults, and collisions that cause injuries or
 worse.’
