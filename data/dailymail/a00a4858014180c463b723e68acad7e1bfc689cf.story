One of Afghanistan's most outspoken feminist MPs has survived an assassination attempt which killed three people.

Shukria Barakzai, a former journalist who once ran a secret school for girls under Taliban rule, escaped with minor injuries after the suicide blast this morning in the capital Kabul.

Officials said the attacker was driving a car which attempted to ram the 42-year-old's vehicle as she headed to Parliament, where she is one of 69 women MPs in the 249-seat chamber.

Survivor: Shukria Barakzai, one of 69 female MPs in Afghanistan's Parliament, leaves the scene of a suicide bomb attack today which killed three people in the capital Kabul including a young girl

Shaken: The MP looked dazed but coherent as she walked from the bomb scene carrying her handbag

Blackened: The MP's car after the blast. She said from hospital: 'I survived because of my people's prayers'

Deaths: Three civilians including a young girl were killed, and their bodies were stretchered from the scene

The attacker then detonated explosives, triggering a blast which was heard across the capital and drew hundreds of people to the scene.

Interior Ministry spokesmen said three civilian bystanders, including a young girl, were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded including Ms Barakzai's driver.

She told the Reuters news agency from her hospital bed: 'I survived because of my people's prayers'.

She was seen walking away from her car, looking dazed but coherent and carrying her handbag, in video footage shot after the incident which circulated online.

It showed twisted metal lying in a crater in the dirt and the front of the MP's silver vehicle was badly damaged and blackened in the blast.

Another yellow car was reduced mostly to a mangled metal shell.

At least one body was seen lying on the ground as another victim walked away from the scene with blood streaming down her face.

Mangled: Another car was left twisted and pockmarked by the blast, which was heard across the capital

Crime: The attack came amid a string of assaults by insurgents for the Taliban, which once ruled the country

Crowds: A member of the Afghan security forces runs as hundreds of people gather at the bombing site

Sirens blared as hundreds of civilians gathered at the scene in a bid to help.

Ms Barakzai is a high-profile advocate of women's rights and media freedom.

She founded the Women's Mirror weekly magazine which specialised in campaigning journalism before becoming an MP ten years ago.

A close ally of new President Ashraf Ghani, she has received several international awards and was named Woman of the Year by BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour in 2005.

No one has formally taken responsibility for today's attack. 

However, it is the latest chapter in escalating violence as the U.S.-backed Afghan government comes under fire from insurgents for the Taliban, which ruled the country before being toppled by Western forces after the September 11 attacks.

During the Taliban's rule women's rights were severely restricted, and the 69 women MPs were seen as a mark of progress in the country.

Progress: Ms Barakzai ran a secret school for girls under the Taliban then became a campaigning journalist and later a politician in Afghanistan's Parliament, which has 69 women - a higher proportion than Britain

Outspoken: The MP on the campaign trail in 2005. She is not the first female politician to be targeted 

Unstable: The attack comes as U.S. and UK troops withdraw from the country after 13 years of bloodshed

Blow: Investigators at the scene today. Last week the Taliban made a bid to kill Kabul's police chief

At almost 28 per cent of MPs, women make up a higher proportion of Afghanistan's Parliament than Britain's - where the figure is just 23 per cent.

But the situation remains unstable amid mounting attacks as British and U.S. forces prepare to leave the country after 13 years.

Last week the Taliban made an assassination attempt on Kabul's chief of police, General Mohammad Zahir Zahir.

And it is not the first attack on the female Afghan MP. Former teacher Fariba Ahmadi Kakar was abducted at gunpoint in August last year when insurgents stopped her car on a highway.

She and her children were returned a month later, reportedly in exchange for five Taliban fighters and six family members.
