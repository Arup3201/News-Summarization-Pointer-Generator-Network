Three teenagers have been killed and a fourth has been injured after their car crashed into a wall.

Jenna Barbour, 18, was killed along with Josh Stewart and David Armstrong in the collision along a rural road in Tyninghame, East Lothian.

Their friend, Robbie Gemmell, was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries and his condition was described as stable.

All three boys were pupils at Dunbar Grammar School while Miss Barbour had left the same school in the summer.

The accident happened at about 8.30pm yesterday when the Peugeot 206 in which they were travelling came off the road and struck a wall. No other vehicles were involved.

A neighbour of Jenna's parents, who asked not to be named, said: 'She was such a lovely girl. It's a complete shock.

'I've lived here for years so I've practically watched her grow up.

'She was into horse riding. You just can't imagine what they are going through.

'She has a younger brother and he must be devastated. It is just horrible, especially so near to Christmas.'

Investigations are continuing into how the car left the road causing the three deaths last night

He said: 'Dunbar Grammar School is mourning the loss of three students killed in a road accident near East Linton last night.

'Dunbar
is a very close and strong community and very few young people at 
school will not have known at least one of the young people involved.

'A special assembly was held this morning with S5/S6 to reflect on what had happened and to offer comfort and support.

'She was such a lovely girl. It's a complete shock...You just can't imagine what they are going through. She has a younger brother and he must be devastated. It is just horrible, especially so near to Christmas'

'Teachers across the school are supporting young people and counselling services are also on hand.

'Students have been offered the opportunity to go home as long as there’s someone there to support them. However, many have opted to stay to seek support from their friends and staff.

'The grief will be felt for a long time and at the moment the school is focusing on supporting its young people and the families of those who died, and on sending our best wishes and thoughts for the recovery of the young person who survived the accident.'

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Tragically, this incident has resulted in three young people losing their lives and we are currently trying to establish exactly what has happened.

'Any motorists who were on the road at the time and have information that can help with our investigation is asked to contact police immediately.'
