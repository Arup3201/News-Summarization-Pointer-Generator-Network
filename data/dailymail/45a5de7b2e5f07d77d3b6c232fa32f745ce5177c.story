America’s love affair with its pet pooches is set to reach new heights next month with a launch of a TV network especially for our four-legged friends.

DogTV claims to be the first 24-hour TV channel for man’s best friend and launches across the country on August 1 on DirecTV. A trial has been running in San Diego for the past 12 months.

PTV, the company behind the channel, claims to have spent more than four years working with behavioral experts to develop and test programming for dogs of all breeds and ages.

Programming on DogTV will consist of 3- to 6-minute video clips of three categories of content including relation, stimulation and 'exposure'

The network believes DogTV can become an alternative to leaving your pet ‘home alone’ or taking it to doggie daycare while you’re at work.

Content will consist of 3- to 6-minute video clips in three categories: relaxation, stimulation and ‘exposure,’ which centers on segments designed to habituate dogs to domestic stimuli (like riding in a car with a toddler).

'Dogs that are left alone tend to become anxious so the calming sounds and music in the relaxing segments on DogTV were created to keep them peaceful,' explains the DogTV website.

'Many dogs also suffer from a lack of stimulation, which becomes acute when their parents are away. The stimulating segments provide dogs with invigorating images, animation and exciting real world sounds to keep them up and running.'

The U.S. has the highest dog ownership 
rate in the world. According to a 2011-2012 APPA National Pet Owners 
Survey, 46.3 per cent of households own a dog and there are an estimated
78 million dogs in the country.

The producers cite research conducted by 
the American Kennel Club and IAMS dog food that found that nearly half of dog
owners said their pets showed 'some interest' in what was happening on 
the TV screen. 

‘The dog-approved programming content was created to entertain, relax and stimulate stay-at-home dogs, so owners don’t come home to ripped-up couches, shredded magazines or a favorite pair of heels chewed to bits,’ a spokesperson told Variety.

For the first two weeks of August, DogTV will be available for free to any DirecTV subscriber.

Dog
owners who register before Aug. 10 will receive 30 days free through 
mid-September, after which the channel will be $4.99 per month. In 
addition, those signing up for the early-dog special will receive a 
PetHub dog ID tag and $10 coupon codes for PetBest.com and Dog Is Good.

The network is recognized by the Humane 
Society of the United States and uses concepts supported by 
organizations including the American Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and the American Veterinary Medical 
Association (AVMA).
