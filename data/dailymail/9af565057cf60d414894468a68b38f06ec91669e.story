Former Sydney Morning Herald journalist Mike Carlton has hit out at Attorney General George Brandis after he claimed the columnist was 'sacked' for 'anti-Semitic journalism' during a Senate estimates hearing.

Carlton said he would sue Senator Brandis if he repeated the claim that the journalist was fired over outside the Senate, where he is not protected by parliamentary privilege.

'Brandis says I was 'sacked' by the SMH for "anti-Semitic journalism.' Say that outside the Senate, Soapy, and I'll sue your smug a*** off,' he wrote on Twitter.

On Thursday during a hearing of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis made the claims when he hit out at Carlton for criticising the winner of the Prime Minister's Literary Award in the history category.

Carlton has been very vocal about his disapproval of joint winner Hal G.P. Colebatch's book Australia's Secret War - which he labelled a 'right-wing rant against Australian trade unions' in a column published in Crikey.

Senator Brandis said he encouraged controversy over art prizes but labelled Carlton's statements 'rather mean-spirited controversy'.

'One of the unsuccessful shortlisted candidates for the Australian History Award, Mike Carlton, who was earlier this year sacked by The Sydney Morning Herald for his anti-Semitic journalism, took to Twitter to denounce one of the joint winners of the prize,' he said,

Mr Brandis also said Carlton made 'some very, very unpleasant and really despicable personal attacks' on the chair of the panel Gerard Henderson.

'So, from all the dozens of entrants into that category, it had put him as one of the five shortlisted candidates and already awarded him a prize of $5,000,' he continued.

'But, because he did not win the award or was not named as one of the joint winners, he took to Twitter to attack Gerard Henderson and attack one of the joint winners of the prize, which I thought was pretty poor form.'

On Friday, Carlton hit back saying Senator Brandis was 'completely wrong'.

'I was not sacked by the Herald, I resigned, and there was no hint of anti-Semitic journalism,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'But I do not expect a fool like Brandis to get those small, important details right.

'Just as we all have a right to be a bigot, I suppose the Attorney General has a right to be a nincompoop.'

Carlton sensationally quit the Sydney Morning Herald in August after coming under fire for using abusive language in response to reader feedback about his column on the Gaza-Israel conflict.

The column was run alongside a cartoon showing a Jewish man watching Gaza be bombed from his armchair, which the newspaper later apologised for.

Sydney Morning Herald Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir also apologised for Carlton's behaviour, calling it 'completely unacceptable'.

'I have asked Mike to apologise for these actions. Mike regrets his behaviour and will be contacting affected readers to apologise,' Mr Goodsir said.

'On behalf of the Herald, I too apologise for any offence caused.'

At the time Carlton said he ended his long career at the paper when representatives rang to tell him they were suspending him for 'four to six weeks'.

The move came as he was slammed for using abusive language towards readers, including calling one a 'Jewish bigot' and telling them to 'f*** off'.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Senator Brandis for comment.
