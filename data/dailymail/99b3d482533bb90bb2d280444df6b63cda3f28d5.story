It is meant to be the season of goodwill but one motorist seemed to have other ideas - removing clothes intended for a good cause, and then dumping some old electrical equipment in their place.

Smiling broadly, the woman was caught on camera driving away from a village hall after offloading bags of rubbish and then loading up her car with sacks of donated charity clothing.

The brazen blonde pulled up at the charity bin in an affluent Oxfordshire village and spent nearly ten minutes stuffing the bags into her blue Vauxhall Corsa.

A woman was caught on camera driving away from a village hall after offloading bags of rubbish and then loading up her car with sacks of donated charity clothing

The brazen blonde pulled up at the charity bin in an affluent Oxfordshire village and spent nearly ten minutes stuffing the bags into her blue Vauxhall Corsa

The pictures, taken on November 24, show the woman smiling and looking directly at a new CCTV camera which parish councillors had installed just weeks before the theft

The woman, aged in her 30 or 40s and wearing an olive green parka, made several trips between her car and the collection point and made room for the clothes by dumping her own rubbish at the side of Sonning Common village hall.

The donated clothes had been destined to raise money for the county’s air ambulance service.

The pictures, taken on November 24, show the woman smiling and looking directly at a new CCTV camera which parish councillors had installed just weeks before the theft.

Philip Collings, clerk of Sonning Common Parish Council, South Oxon., said they had to hire a van to clear up the woman’s rubbish, including an old extractor fan and electrical equipment.

'She looks quite pleased with herself and no doubt gets 10 out of 10 for being home quickly with some potentially valuable clothing,' Mr Collings said.

Parish Council chairman Douglas Kedge said: 'The clothes deposit is used for charitable purposes and shouldn’t be misused,

'Anyone who steals from that is reprehensible.'

Mr Collings said the unregistered car was not displaying a tax disc but hoped the clear pictures would prompt people who recognised the woman to contact police.

'We would love to know where she is because it would discourage her from doing it again,' he said.

'It has cost us money because we have to pay the waste wheeler to take it away and this woman has stolen four large sacks full of clothing that someone donated to a good cause.

'There are some excellent dumps around here that cost nothing other than petrol to go to.

'You don’t have have to upset anyone else’s life by dumping stuff on their doorstep.'
