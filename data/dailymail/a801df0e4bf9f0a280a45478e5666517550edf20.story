An array of high-profile international cricketers — including disgraced former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent — will be called to a London court next year to give evidence in the Chris Cairns perjury case.

Cairns learned on Thursday he will face charges — which The Mail on Sunday understands will be formally laid on September 25 — over allegations he lied in court after being accused of being involved in match-fixing by former Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi.

The Indian businessman, whose lawyers are understood to be preparing a case against Cairns, paid about £90,000 in damages to Cairns in 2012 after Modi failed to prove claims that the former New Zealand and Nottinghamshire all-rounder was involved in fixing matches. 

Former Kiwis allrounder Chris Cairns was named in an ICC investigation into match fixing in December 

Chris Cairns took over 200 Test wickets for New Zealand during a career that spanned 15 years 

But evidence given to the Metropolitan Police by Vincent, who has been banned for life after admitting fixing matches included a County Championship game between Sussex and Kent in 2011, has led to Cairns’s evidence being called in question and left perjury charges imminent.

A number of his former team-mates, including Vincent and current New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, will be called to give evidence against Cairns if, as expected, the trial goes ahead in London next May.

Earlier this year, McCullum gave evidence to the ICC’s anti-corruption unit in which he claimed he was approached by a former top player, dubbed ‘Player X’, who asked him to fix matches. Cairns publicly acknowledged he believed McCullum was referring to him but has repeatedly denied match-fixing.

The Mail on Sunday has learned the following players will be called to give evidence at the trial: Andre Adams, Shane Bond, Nathan Astle, Stephen Fleming, Chris Harris, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey, Daniel Vettori and Chris Harris.

The strong all-rounder racked up over 8000 international runs during his career, just 50 short of 5000 in ODIs
