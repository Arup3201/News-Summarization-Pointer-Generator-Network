Spectacular photographs have captured the moment thousands of wildebeest attempt to make their way across the Mara River in Kenya which is infested with crocodiles waiting to kill. 

A cloud of dust kicks up into the air as the beasts tumble down the river bank before leaping 20 feet into the water.

Some lose their footing breaking their backs and legs when they fall onto the hard ground but most make it to the other side unscathed.

Dramatic: Photographs have captured the moment thousands of wildebeest attempt to make their way across the Mara River in Kenya

Those unfortunate enough to stumble are snapped up by the hungry crocodiles waiting for an easy meal.

Wildlife photographer Robyn Preston, 59, from New Zealand, said: 'It was horrifying watching the wildebeest falling to the bottom.

'Some fell into the river and were either swept away or made it to a sand bank in the middle. From there they were unable to move without crawling along on their front limbs.'

Wildebeests make the migration every year across the river to the grasslands of the Maasai Mara.

Normally they choose an easier crossing but the sheer number of animals forced the migration across the river at this point.

Ms
 Preston said: 'My driver has been in the safari business for many years
 and said he had never seen anything like it before either.

'One croc came up and grabbed a calf that had made its way to the sand bank in the middle. It was injured and had no way of escaping the crocs jaws.

'The calf was still half in the water so was an easy meal. The crocodile dragged it away and drowned it.'

Sticking together: Wildebeests make the migration every year across the river to the grasslands of the Maasai Mara

The annual
 Wildebeest Migration at the Maasai Mara is a natural cycle that 
replenishes and renews the grasslands of East Africa. 

Each June, around 1.3million Wildebeest gather in the Serengeti to calve. 

They slowly mass into a huge single herd, until the dry season withers their supply of fresh grass.

The
 scent of rain to the North begins to draw the herd throughout July and 
August and soon the world's greatest animal migration is underway.

Lions are frequently seen attacking the herds especially at night dragging down weaker individuals.

At the same time, packs of Hyena weave throughout the herds, singling out and separating the young and the weak.

In the struggle to cross the Mara River, many are drowned or swept away by strong currents. 

The crossing attracts crocodiles who each year wait for the season's bounty. 

By September the herds have reached their destination spreading out to graze across the Mara.
