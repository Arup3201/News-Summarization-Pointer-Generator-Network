Leeds suffered a second defeat in four matches under latest boss Darko Milanic, who remains without a win.

Rotherham ripped their illustrious visitors apart with two goals inside seven second half minutes to pull level in mid-table.

Goalscorer Alex Revell said: ‘We never say die. We wanted to prove to people we deserved to come up and we’ve done that.’

Who could possibly have imagined even a year or two ago that Rotherham United would have a chance of overhauling Leeds?

But that was the prospect savoured by Steve Evans' double promotion-winners and it was enough to fill the New York Stadium even with live television cameras peering in.

Evans rated it the biggest league game of his career as well as being the biggest of Rotherham's modern history.

At the start only three points - in Leeds favour - separated these Yorkshire sides who ordinarily could never be described as rivals.

But Mirco Antenucci scored against the run of play to cushion the threat.

Souleymane Doukara split the Rotherham rearguard and as defenders looked for offside, Antenucci timed his run and calm finish to perfection.

Either side of the Italian's third Leeds goal, Matt Derbyshire failed with a great chance for a Rotherham and Alex Revell forced Marco Silvestri into a full-length save.

But Leeds were increasingly menacing on the break to justify their advantage.

It was their first meeting in ten seasons. Nevertheless, connections lingered.

The Millers' Paul Green and Frazer Richardson had spells at Elland Road - and midfielder Lee Frecklington is a lifelong supporter.

Rotherham's rushed start to the second half was rewarded when Leeds fan Frecklington made a surging run into the area.

His fierce shot was parried by Silvestri and Revell expertly hooked in the loose ball.

Then substitute Jonson Clarke-Harris exploded off the bench as Evans' team seized the lead with a second goal in six minutes.

Clarke-Harris thundered in from 25 yards, the youngster's first goal as a £350,000 club record signing from Oldham.
