Britain will continue to 'tighten the screw' on Russia with increased sanctions unless it pulls back from eastern Ukraine, Philip Hammond warned today.

The Foreign Secretary admitted Britain will suffer some economic pain from trade embargoes with Russia, but insisted: 'You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.'

The European Union last night agreed a new crackdown on against vast sectors of the Russian economy, designed to cripple its banks, energy firms and defence capabilities.

Russian President Vladmir Putin will continue to be targeted with economic sanctions until he behaves 'properly', the UK government has warned

The EU imposed an arms embargo, banking curbs and a ban on trade in sensitive and dual-use technologies to punish Russia for its actions in its neighbouring country. 

A further eight Russians will also face asset freezes and travel bans.

Global pressure is mounting on Russia to co-operate with the investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.

The international community believes it was shot down by pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine, almost certainly using a missile from Russia.

There are growing calls for Mr Putin to stop the supply of dangerous and sophisticated weapons into the hands of semi-trained separatists.

But Mr Hammond insisted the latest round of sanctions was not the end of it, and Britain would continue to 'ratchet' up pressure on Moscow until Vladmir Putin behaves 'properly'.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond admitted Britain will suffer some economic pain from trade embargoes with Russia

He told BBC Breakfast: 'This is a tough new set of sanctions which we’ve led the way on getting agreed in Europe.

'The whole idea is to have a ratchet here. Every time something happens, every time the Russians fail to respond to international demands, we will tighten the screw a little bit more.'

Mr Hammon admitted that the British economy would also take a hit as a result of the econmic crackdown, but insisted: 'The sanctions package is designed to hurt Russia more than it hurts us, but it would be absurd to suggest that we could impose wide-ranging on the Russian economy without also having some impact on ourselves.

'But if we are going to take a stand against Russian aggression, if we are going to insist on Russia behaving like a civilised nation in the modern world then we have to be prepared to pay the price for doing that.'

He later told Sky News that the measures had been 'designed to maximise the impact on Russia and minimise the impact on EU economies'.He later

But he added: 'You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs, and if we want to impose economic pain on Russia in order to try to encourage it to behave properly in eastern Ukraine and to give access to the crash site, then we have to be prepared to take these measures.'

The White House swiftly followed up the EU's announcement with a fresh round of sanctions of its own, targeting three Russian banks.

US president Barack Obama said: 'Today Russia is once again isolating itself from the international community, setting back decades of genuine progress. 

'It does not have to be this way. This a choice Russia and president Putin has made.'

David Cameron yesterday met families of British victims of the atrocity, as he warned Russia has failed to stem the flow of weapons across the border to Ukraine since a surface-to-air missile was used to destroy flight MH17, killing all 298 people on board.

Barry Sweeney, whose 28-year-old son Liam died in the July 17 crash, said: 'We basically asked Mr Cameron just to help. The talking I suppose has got to stop and the doing has got to be done.

'I feel very angry and frustrated. It would be nice if they could just stop fighting for a little bit so that we could get all our boys and girls home.'

Mr Sweeney, whose son Liam was among 10 Britons killed in the atrocity, said he was meeting the Prime Minister 'under not very nice circumstances'

The Prime Minister said: ‘We must do everything we can to make that crash site is properly managed; that their loved ones are brought home and that everything that can be done on that front is being done.’

Mr Cameron added: 'The sanctions really relate to Vladimir Putin's and Russia's behaviour, and we want to make it absolutely clear that Russia's behaviour in destabilising another country - Ukraine - is unacceptable.'

Europe's arms embargo will block any trade with Russia in weapons or 'related material'. With its own major arms industry stemming from the era of Cold War isolation, Russia has little need to import weapons from the EU, but sells more than 3billion euros worth a year to member states.

However, the embargo will apply only to future contracts, so one big deal that won't be affected is the heavily criticised 1.2billion-euro sale of two French helicopter carriers to Russia, which has already been agreed.

The EU's banking curbs are a more significant step. They will deny Russia's state-owned banks access to European capital markets by banning Europeans from buying their bonds, equities or financial instruments with a higher maturity than 90 days.

Global pressure is mounting on Russia to co-operate with the investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 

The measures were agreed as world aviation chiefs set up a 'senior level' international task force to deal with the threat to passenger planes following the downing of flight MH17.

A top-level safety conference involving more than 190 nations will also take place in February under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

Following a meeting of global aviation bodies in Montreal, ICAO's secretary general Raymond Benjamin said all the aviation bodies 'strongly condemned the use of weapons against the civilian aircraft'.

European Council president Herman van Rompuy said the new EU sanctions had been imposed after Russia ignored calls to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, with arms and fighters continuing to flow across the border in support of the pro-Moscow separatist rebels.

'It is meant as a strong warning: illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilisation of a neighbouring sovereign country cannot be accepted in 21st century Europe,' he said.

'Furthermore, when the violence created spirals out of control and leads to the killing of almost 300 innocent civilians in their flight from the Netherlands to Malaysia, the situation requires an urgent and determined response.'

Meanwhile, US secretary of state John Kerry accused separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine of showing 'an appalling disrespect for human decency' in carrying on fighting close to the site where MH17 crashed after apparently being shot out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile.

The fact that not all the remains of the 298 victims of the disaster had yet been recovered had placed 'an unsupportable burden on families', who 'clearly deserve a thorough, international investigation', Mr Kerry said in a Washington DC press conference. 

Signs were emerging of concern in the City of London about the possible blowback sanctions on Russia could inflict on the UK economy.

Energy giant BP - which owns a 20 per cent stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft - warned that further international sanctions could have a 'material adverse impact' on the company's business in Russia and its own financial position.
