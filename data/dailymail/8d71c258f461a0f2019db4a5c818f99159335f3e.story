Tottenham are monitoring developments with Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow.

Mauricio Pochettino wants a young goalkeeper to challenge Hugo Lloris and the 23-year-old, who has also been watched by Liverpool, is on their list of potential targets.

Spurs are determined to keep hold of Lloris and have refused all offers for the France international.

Lloris is highly valued and his presence

Help the aged: Brad Friedel has signed a new contract and could become the Premier League's oldest ever player

Meanwhile, Brad Friedel has signed a new one-year deal with Tottenham - setting him on course to become the oldest Premier League player ever.

Former Manchester City goalkeeper John Burridge currently holds the record, having appeared aged 43 years, 4 months and 26 days.

However, if Friedel appears for Tottenham on or after October 15, 2014 then he will break the record which Burridge set in the 1994-95 season in a 3-2 defeat against Queens Park Rangers.
