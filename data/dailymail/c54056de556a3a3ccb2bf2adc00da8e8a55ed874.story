The family of the nurse who apparently killed herself after being duped by a hoaxer pretending to be the Queen described their devastating loss yesterday.

Jacintha Saldanha, a 46-year-old mother of two, was found dead on Friday morning in nurses’ accommodation at the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge had been treated for acute morning sickness.

Her husband, Ben Barboza, 49,  an NHS accountant, said: ‘I am devastated with the tragic loss of my beloved wife Jacintha in tragic circumstances.’

Tragic: The grieving family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha who died in a suspected suicide have told of their devastation at her death. She is pictured centre, with son Junal and daughter Lisha

Loss: Husband Benedict Barboza, a 49-year-old hospital accountant, also known as Ben, posted a tribute to Mrs Saldanha on his Facebook page

And in a poignant message posted on 
Facebook, the couple’s 14-year-old daughter Lisha said of her mother: ‘I
miss you, I loveeee you.’

Mrs
Saldanha’s sister-in-law Celin D’Souza added: ‘I will really miss her a
lot. She was good-natured. I cannot forget her, she was so good.’

Three
days before her death, Mrs Saldanha was manning the hospital 
switchboard when she took a call from two Australian radio presenters – 
Mel Greig and Michael Christian – impersonating the Queen and Prince 
Charles.

They were transferred to the Duchess’s ward and broadcast confidential information given to them by a second nurse.

Although she wasn’t blamed in any way for what happened, friends said Mrs Saldanha ‘took it very badly’.

Described as popular, quiet and 
‘profoundly caring’, she is said to have made clear to her family the 
depth of her anxiety when the prank was broadcast.

Others
have described her as feeling lonely and confused, though the hospital 
said it supported her and stressed she did not face any disciplinary 
action.

Mrs Saldanha’s husband raised the alarm after failing to reach her by phone on Friday. Friends said the speed with which he did so reflected his concern for her wellbeing.

Last night the chairman of the King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, wrote to the owners of the radio station, 2Day FM, condemning the ‘humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses’.

Anxious: Although she wasn’t blamed in any way for what happened, friends said Mrs Saldanha ‘took it very badly’

Family grief: Jacintha Saldanha's Indian family, pictured, was informed about her death last night when her partner Benedict called in tears

In shock: Mrs Saldanha's Indian family spoke about their heartache today. Mother-in-law Carmine Barboza, 69, said: 'We just cannot believe what has happened'

Lord Glenarthur called the decision 
to broadcast the prank ‘truly appalling’ and said the consequence of the
presenters’ actions was ‘tragic beyond words’.

Caught
in an international backlash, Greig and Christian were yesterday in 
hiding, where they were said to be receiving medical assistance amid 
growing fears for their ‘physical and emotional wellbeing’.

While
it is not thought the presenters broke any laws, they are expected to 
be interviewed by police. Scotland Yard is preparing a report for Mrs 
Saldanha’s inquest and requires statements from them.

Yesterday the dead nurse’s family were being comforted by relatives and friends at their terrace home in Southmead, Bristol.

A friend who answered the door said Mr Barboza, Lisha and the couple’s 16-year-old son Junal were ‘very, very shocked and unhappy’.

Mrs Saldanha, from Valencia in south-west India, married Mr Barboza, from the nearby village of Shirva, in 1993. They moved to Bristol nine years ago. When she was working in London she lived in nurse’s quarters behind the hospital, returning to the family home on her days off.

Mr Barboza’s mother Carmine, 69, said the family returned to India to visit her every two years. She said neither her son nor daughter-in-law had told her about the hoax call.

‘Everything seemed normal,’ she said. ‘But then we got a call last night from Benedict informing us that Jacintha had died. He was crying and couldn’t speak much.

‘We don’t know whether we’ll be able to bring her body back to India but we desperately hope so.

Backlash: 2DayFM DJs Mel Greig, left, and Michael Christian, right, have been bombarded with abuse online since Jacintha Saldanha's death at King Edward VII hospital's lodgings was announced

Tragedy: Jacintha Saldanha transferred a prank call from two Australian DJs who found out intimate details about Prince William's wife Kate Middleton who was staying at the hospital suffering from morning sickness

Distraught: Mrs Saldanha's body was found at staff lodgings close to King Edward VII hospital in London yesterday

‘We spoke to Benedict again this 
morning and he said he hasn’t been allowed to see her body yet because 
of legal formalities and she’ll not be handed over before Monday.

‘Jacintha was a very caring woman. We just cannot believe what has happened.’

Yesterday
a wooden cross with a British flag was left outside the King Edward VII
Hospital, while flowers were placed outside the nearby nurses’ block.

A
note read: ‘Dear Jacintha, Our thoughts are with you and your family. 
From all your fellow nurses, we bless your soul. RIP xxx’

Neeraj
Singh, a former colleague who worked with Mrs Saldanha  at Southmeads 
Hospital in Bristol, said news of her death was ‘devastating’.

Mrs Saldanha once described herself as ‘a very nervous person’ in a testimonial penned for her driving teacher’s website.

Instructor Jeff Sellick recalled her as quiet and sometimes needing a confidence boost, adding that he felt the prank call would have ‘played very heavy on her mind’.
