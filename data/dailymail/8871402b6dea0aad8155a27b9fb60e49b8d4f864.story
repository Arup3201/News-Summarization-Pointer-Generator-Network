Truth: Marina Litvinenko has made a passionate plea for cash to fund a public inquiry into her husband's death

The tearful widow of poisoned Russian Spy Alexander Litvinenko yesterday tearfully appealed for donations to fund a legal challenge to probe his death.

Mr Litvinenko died after he drank tea that had been spiked with radioactive polonium-210 with two former KGB colleagues at a hotel in London in 2006.

Claims have been made that he was recruited by MI6 after fleeing Russia and the Government has ‘established’ Moscow has a ‘prima facie case’ to answer for his assassination.

An inquest had been looking into his death with both the British and Russian governments refusing to release key documents.

Coroner Sir Robert Owen asked for a public inquiry, saying that he could not hear evidence in public at a normal inquest linked to the alleged involvement of the Russian state in Mr Litvinenko’s death.

Despite his request, Home Secretary Theresa May decided in May the inquest should proceed, and the question whether to hold a public inquiry or other form of further investigation should be decided after a verdict was returned.

But Marina Litvinenko has applied for a judicial review to reverse Mrs May’s decision.

However, she lost a ‘protected costs’ order at the High Court on Thursday. This means that despite her lawyers working for free, if Mrs Litvinenko loses the legal challenge she will have to pay the Government’s costs of £40,000.

Mrs Litvinenko burst into tears while speaking to journalists yesterday where she said without financial help she would lose ‘almost everything’.

She said: ‘This is a very important 
time for me and I have to make a serious decision. I only want to get to
the truth. I have 48 hours to decide.

‘This is the only chance to get to the truth and justice. I absolutely just cannot give up. This is no ordinary case.

‘Sacha
(Mr Litvinenko) was a British citizen and he was killed in Britain.’ 
The inquest has been given written arguments by the Met Police to allow 
two officers to give evidence anonymously.

Legal arguments made by the Press – including the Daily Mail – argued for full disclosure and open hearings despite not being allowed to see the police’s argument.

Counsel for the inquiry, Hugh Davies QC, told the court that the Met Police’s own risk management for the safety of witnesses from attacks by ‘Foreign Intelligence Services’ had been downgraded from ‘possibly’ to ‘unlikely’.

Sir Robert Owen said: ‘It remains my 
concern that there will be the greatest amount of public disclosure.’ 
Further arguments on the anonymity of witnesses were held in secret in 
which both the Press and public were not allowed to attend.

The
death of 43-year-old Mr Litvinenko, a fugitive from the Putin regime, 
in 2006 plunged Anglo-Russian relations into a deep freeze.

The former KGB agent became violently sick after visiting former colleagues in a hotel in Mayfair, central London.

As he lay dying in hospital, ‘reluctant to tell police that he was an MI6 agent’, he handed detectives the mobile phone number of his MI6 handler ‘Martin’, an earlier hearing heard.

Mrs Litvinenko believes MI6 failed to protect her husband from the Russians.

Former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun, who met him at the Millennium Hotel, are prime suspects in the murder. Both deny involvement.

The Crown Prosecution Service wants to charge Lugovoy, but Russia refuses to extradite him.The inquest continues.
