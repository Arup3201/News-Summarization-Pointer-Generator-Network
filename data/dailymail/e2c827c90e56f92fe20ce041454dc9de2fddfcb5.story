Television legends David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz are just hours away from their last hurrah as hosts of iconic show At The Movies and there is no more fitting tribute to say goodbye than honouring them through film.

Parody video maker Huw Parkinson took a brief break from satirising Australian politics to cut together the well-known scene from Armageddon where Bruce Willis' character Harry delivers a heart-breaking message to his daughter, Grace, played by Liv Tyler with the ABC hosts' farewell.

In the hilarious video, Stratton and Pomeranz take over Harry's part in a conversation he has with Grace.

A parody video features a scene from movie Armageddon (above) cut together with the farewell speech of At The Movies hosts David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz

Grace approaches a screen with static on it before the pair suddenly appear on the monitor.

Pomeranz starts with: 'Well as you might heard by now, we've reached the point where we're stepping down from our chairs…’.

As it is in the movie, Grace replies: 'I don't understand.' 

The pair continue as Grace reacts to their dialogue exactly as she does in the movie to Harry's farewell, which makes for amusing viewing.

When Stratton and Pomeranz cut out, Grace paws at the screen and cries 'No' with tears running down her face. 

The famous hosts have graced the silver screen for 28 years and have become a regular fixture in Australian households, giving their often frank reviews on upcoming releases.

Margaret, 70, and David 75, filmed their final episode for the ABC last Tuesday and speaking to The Daily Telegraph at their farewell function, Margaret said  it was an odd feeling to have wrapped.

'It has been really strangely confronting,' she said. 

'It just doesn’t feel real. I’m not joking. I think when you bow out like this, you have got to bow out and move over.' 

Margaret went on to say she and her-co-host were comfortable with the decision to leave the show and would not be returning in the future, but leaving at a time when the ABC was facing cuts was particularly difficult. 

Speaking to Pedestrian TV, she said: 'I feel like I'm abandoning it in times of need.' 

While co-host David Stratton added the pair were 'both quite distressed about what's happened in the past two to three weeks' at the home of the public broadcaster.

The successful duo were joined at the party by acting royalty Geoffrey Rush, who delivered a speech on the night.

Other notable attendees included actors Bryan Brown and his wife Rachel Ward, as well as the managing director of the ABC, Mark Scott.

Margaret and David also gave a farewell speech to their fellow guests. 

They first appeared together on the SBS channel in 1986, before switching to the ABC in 1994. 

Over their illustrious career, David and Margaret have interviewed a number of notable celebrities.

The final episode of At The Movies will air on Tuesday at 9.30pm.

Over the period of time of being on air together, they have also been awarded several times. 

At their farewell party, Geoffrey Rush was one of the stars who gave a speech to say goodbye to the pair

Margaret was made a Member Of The Order on Australia Day in 2005.

In 2001, David was not only awarded the Centenary Medal for 'Service to Australian Society And Australian Film Production, but he also received the Australian Film Institute's Longford Life Achievement Award. 

While several films were given five star ratings during their time at SBS, only six films were given the highest ratings during the ten year run at ABC.
