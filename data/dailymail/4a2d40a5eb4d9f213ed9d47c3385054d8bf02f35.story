Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell is demanding an apology from Theresa May after privately accusing the Home Secretary of masterminding his exit from Government over ‘Plebgate’.

He is convinced he lost his job last autumn because of a police conspiracy – and that Mrs May was instrumental  in turning the Cabinet against him when his fate hung in  the balance.

And he also believes she let her view that his position had become untenable become known to the media.

Mr Mitchell has admitted swearing when asked to take his bicycle through a side gate at Downing Street last September, but has always insisted police fabricated claims that he called them ‘f****** plebs’.

He resigned in October after a police log, which appeared to corroborate the officers’ account, was leaked. Scotland Yard is investigating his claim that the allegations were concocted. Preliminary findings are expected to be released within days.

Mr Mitchell wants Mrs May to personally apologise for ‘prejudging’ him. He believes she told colleagues he should not remain in his job because his continued presence was damaging the Government. He claims to have proof she briefed journalists to that effect.

When Mrs May was asked at the time whether she had been in the ‘vanguard’ of efforts to force him to step down, she said: ‘I’m not going to talk about private conversations.’

A friend of Mr Mitchell said last night: ‘There are many at Westminster who feel it would be nice if those who got it so wrong were to acknowledge that.’ A spokeswoman for Mrs May declined to comment.

Mr Mitchell, who is supported by powerful figures including former party leader Michael Howard and ex-Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, is confident a prosecution review of evidence gathered by Operation Alice, the Scotland Yard investigation into claims of police fabrication, will back his version of events.

A Channel 4 investigation cast doubt on the initial police account when it revealed that CCTV footage showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the gate during the row, as was originally claimed. And an email supposedly from a witness backing up the police account of events has also been called into question.

Earlier this month The Mail on Sunday disclosed that Mr Mitchell had written to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman  of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, to accuse police of a sustained ‘dishonest and illicit’ campaign to destroy him, including the leaking of information to the press that suggested the inquiry would dismiss his claims. 

It will be announced tomorrow that Mr Mitchell, a former International Development Secretary, will join the board of a charity that aims to build on the legacy of the London Olympics.

International Inspiration, chaired by Lord Coe, uses sporting ambassadors, including Tanni Grey-Thompson and Chris Hoy, to help 15 million disadvantaged children around the world.
