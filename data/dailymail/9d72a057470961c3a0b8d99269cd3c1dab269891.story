Timothy Millender continued working for the clinic despite being a convicted paedophile

A paedophile was allowed to run a clinic offering treatments to young children for two months after a court found him guilty of his sickening crimes.

Timothy Millender, 32, continued to work at Redwood Health Therapies, in Winchester, Hampshire, which offered hypnotherapy to youngsters under 16, despite being given a six month suspended sentence for hoarding vile images of babies being raped and tortured.

Millender pleaded guilty at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court to having 740 pictures and 106 videos of children as young as six months being abused. Some of the films were level five, the most extreme level possible.

On top of his suspended sentence, he was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register but still went back to work at the clinic.

Millender was listed as a director of the company which, according to the Sunday Mirror, was hastily shut down last week.

However, the website is still live and claims the hypnotherapy sessions 'help children to free themselves of their bottled up emotions' by using the 'Blowaway Technique' - a popular form of therapy where children are hypnotised into a physically relaxed state and then told to literally 'blow away' any bad feelings or problems they may have.

A former employee told the Sunday Mirror: 'It's shocking a convicted paedophile could carry on running a business advertising services for children.

'The images he was looking at were of the very worst kind yet he walked free from court and was able to carry on running the clinic for two months after he pleaded guilty. It's disgusting.'

The clinic rebranded itself St Giles Health and Beauty earlier this month. It claimed to be under new management, although Millender was still listed as a director. However, clients who turned up for appointments last week found the door locked.

The clinic has been approached for comment.
