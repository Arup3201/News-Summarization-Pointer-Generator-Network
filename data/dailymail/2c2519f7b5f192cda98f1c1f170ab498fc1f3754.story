Former two-weight world champion Ricky Burns claimed his legal battle with Frank Warren had 'seriously affected' his boxing after the case ended with both sides declaring victory.

Burns, who is managed by Alex Morrison, was ordered to pay Warren unpaid commission over a manager agreement following a High Court hearing.

But the judge ruled that Warren was not entitled to anything for the Scot's decision to end their promoter agreement despite claiming lost profits of at least £1.8million.

The judge, Mr Justice Knowles, also ruled that Frank Warren Promotions owed Burns £102,000 purse money but said the Coatbridge fighter was unlikely to receive a penny from the liquidated company.

Burns joined Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing on March 11, 2013, amid frustration over two postponed fights and unpaid earnings from his WBO lightweight win over Kevin Mitchell in September 2012.

After two unconvincing defences, he lost his title to the classy Terence Crawford and has failed to impress in his comeback fights.

In a statement, Burns said: 'The pressure that this case has put on me over the last 18 months has been immense and seriously affected me in and out of the ring.'

The written judgement stated that the judge would decide how much Burns owed Warren for the management fees if the figure was not agreed. Matchroom claimed the figure was £73,000 while Warren described the amount as 'substantial'.

The judge ruled that the now liquidated Frank Warren Promotions owed Burns £102,000, but not Warren personally.

He added in his written judgement: 'From what I heard in evidence about about FWP and its liquidation it is unlikely that any sums will actually be paid by FWP to anyone, including Mr Burns.'

However, Burns has vowed to pursue that sum with the British Boxing Board of Control, with Matchroom calling for the promoter's licence to be suspended.

'I will now be actively pursuing the BBBoC and Frank Warren to make sure that my outstanding fight purse gets paid in full,' the 31-year-old said.

Warren's claim for £1.8million damages was described as 'fanciful' by the judge, who said that any lost profit would have been less than the amount owed to Burns for the Mitchell fight.

The judge added that 'even though Mr Burns was not entitled to terminate the promoter agreement on March 6, 2013, I am quite clear he would have been entitled to shortly after that'.
