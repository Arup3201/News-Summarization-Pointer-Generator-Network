A Muslim student was left in disbelief after buying a packet of Asda cheese and onion rolls to find it contained a pork sausage roll.

Rabia Qureshi, 20, bought the £2 pack of 10 ‘Chosen By You’ branded rolls from the superstore in Bradford, West Yorkshire.

She quickly spotted the single meat-filled pastry after putting it in the microwave to cook it and realised the filling was the wrong colour.

Ms Qureshi, who is studying optometry at the University of Bradford, said: ‘This is not acceptable. I don’t eat sausage rolls and what about vegetarians too? It was really shocking.’

‘I warmed it up in the microwave and I knew that something was wrong. Meat has that texture and I knew it was meat when I looked at it.

‘I got the knife and fork and started to investigate. I disinfected the plate after it and I don’t know what I would have done if I had eaten it.’

She added that her mother was upset because she worried she would have eaten it.

Staff from the supermarket have apologised and are carrying out a detailed investigation after they were unable to understand how it happened.

Asda said only cheese and onion rolls had been processed on that particular production run, and the one previous to that – and there had been no other complaints.

Ms Qureshi continued: ‘I always buy vegetarian food in the supermarket because it is better to be safe.

‘But my mum is scared to buy anything vegetarian from the supermarket now.’

Her mother, Humma Qureshi, 49, said: ‘Vegetarian labelled packaging should contain vegetarian food. I’m concerned that other people could have eaten one by mistake.

‘Some people just nibble at their food and they wouldn’t know that is was meat until it was too late.

‘If it wasn’t meat it could have been a nut and that could have been dangerous for someone with an allergy. People need to know what is going in their food and need to be able to trust it.’

The student has now launched an online campaign against Asda warning people who trust vegetarian labelling to double check their food before they eat it.

She said: ‘What upset me the most is that it takes 40 days to process the complaint and that is not even investigating it.

‘Asda didn’t give me a complaint reference number and they haven’t made any effort with me. I’ve not heard anything back since I made the complaint on Thursday morning.’

The packet was sold to Ms Qureshi at the Lidget Green store in Bradford, West Yorkshire (above) last week

Ms Qureshi claims staff were not willing to remove the batch from the shelf.

She continued: ‘They weren’t budging when I complained and all they cared about was taking the sausage roll off me. It’s in my freezer now. Head office tried to offer me a refund but I want the food to be checked properly. There’s something wrong with the production line.

‘I wouldn’t shop at Asda again and I have told them that. I’m definitely taking legal action and going forward with this. Quality control should have checked it.’

A spokesman for Asda said: ‘We’re at a loss to understand how this happened and are confident this is an isolated incident.

‘We’re sorry for any upset caused to Ms Qureshi, and we’ll be in touch with her shortly with the details of our full investigation.’
