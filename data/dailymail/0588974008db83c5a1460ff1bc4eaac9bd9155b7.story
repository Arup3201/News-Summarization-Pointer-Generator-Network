These dramatic pictures show the extraordinary moment an angler caught a 450lb shark just one mile off a popular tourist beach in Devon.

Graeme Pullen, 62, was fishing for pollock off the North Devon coast when the 8ft long porbeagle shark took his bait.

The experienced fisherman, who caught the epic encounter on camera, wrestled with the shark for more than 30 minutes on Saturday - when nearby beaches would have been full of tourists making the most of the warm weather.

Graeme Pullen, 62, was fishing for pollock off the North Devon coast at the weekend when the 8ft long porbeagle shark took his bait

Mr Pullen, from Hook, Hampshire, was on a fishing trip with friend Wayne Comben, when he hooked the porbeagle - which comes from the same family of sharks as the man-eating Great White

The porbeagle - which is believed to be one of the largest sharks single-handedly caught by a fisherman in British waters before - was so big it sent the fisherman’s 17ft fibre-glass boat spinning in circles.

The huge fish opened its huge jaws right in front of Mr Pullen, exposing its razor-sharp teeth and even left a bite mark on the side of his vessel.

Mr Pullen, from Hook, Hampshire, was on a fishing trip with friend Wayne Comben when he hooked the porbeagle – which comes from the same family of sharks as the man-eating Great White.

He refuses to reveal the exact location of the catch for fear of upsetting tourism chiefs, but confirmed it was less than one mile off a popular holiday beach in North Devon.

It has been suggested in the past to him that reports of sharks in the seas puts off holidaymakers.

If true, the claim bears striking similarities to the classic 1975 movie Jaws in which the mayor of fictional town Amity is terrified the man-eating shark will drive visitors away.

After hooking the ‘enormous’ porbeagle, he legally tagged the shark’s dorsal fin before releasing it back into the water.

Mr Pullen, a keen shark fisherman, said he was surprised to have caught one so early in the season.

He said: ‘We were less than a mile off the North Devon coast over a reef that we know doesn’t get hammered by fishermen.

‘Last year was a terrible year for pollock but on this occasion there was a glut of them. We caught 35 of them the day before and went back out again the next day.

‘About two-and-a-half hours into the trip I put on some sun cream and that was when I noticed my float bob about 70ft from the boat.

‘I could feel something chewing on the bait and as it moved off I could feel it was a lot heavier than a pollock.

‘I
 thought it was a tope - a smaller member of the shark family - but as I
 reeled it closer it grew heavier all the time and after about 40 
seconds I realised it was a big shark.

Mr Pullen's rod is visibly bent as he battles the enormous shark which took around 30 minutes to reel in

‘I jokingly said to Wayne “never mind the pollocks” and went into action stations.

‘He started the engine to keep the shark away from the boat while I spent 30 minutes reeling it in and keeping it on the surface.

Porbeagles are a member of the same 
family as the Great White.

They are not considered to be a 
threat to humans with only three recorded non-fatal attacks before.

Along
 with blue sharks, porbeagles are the most common species of shark found
 in British waters, but they don’t normally arrive until early summer 
when the waters are warmer.

They
 are found all around the UK, usually at least ten miles offshore, but 
sometimes venture closer to shore if prey species are abundant in deeper
 waters.

Porbeagles can grow up to 12ft long and weigh up to 600lbs.

Despite
 its size, fearsome teeth and relation to the Great White, porbeagles 
are shy creatures and not considered a threat to humans.

Some
 experts believe porbeagles and blue sharks are migrating to UK waters 
because there is not enough food for them in the over-fished Atlantic.

The
 porbeagle shark - Lamna nasus in Latin - is classed by the 
International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered 
in the north east Atlantic.

‘It was so big that it was spinning the boat around in circles.

'When it clearly got tired and it was safe to bring it alongside I brought it in.

‘It was an enormous shark and when he swung his head from side to side his jaws opened right up showing his razor sharp teeth.

‘Porbeagles don’t attack humans but you can have a nasty accident with them like you can a chainsaw and it can give a hell of a bite.’

At one stage Mr Pullen was in danger of being dragged into the sea as the strong fishing line wrapped around his hand and he was momentarily attached to it and the shark.

Had the shark gone under the surface, the fisherman would have followed it unless he very quickly cut the line.

He said: ‘Most shark fishing in this country starts in mid-June so this one was very early.

‘The temperature of the water was 16 degrees and even though it’s only May it is warm enough for sharks to be moving in.

‘This could be a sign of a warm summer to come.’

The big catch comes almost two years to the day that Mr Pullen caught another porbeagle shark in similar waters.

On 23 May 2012, he and Mr Comben spent an hour and half trying to reel in their catch - after they hooked a 10ft porbeagle off the coast of Boscastle in North Cornwall.

The shark, which weighed 550lbs, dragged the two men and their 17ft-long boat for a mile as they battled to reel it in using a rod and line taken from a garden strimmer.

Again, they released the huge fish back into the sea after tagging it but not before it worked itself into a frenzy.

At the time, Mr Comben, a 45-year-old water engineer from Havant, Hampshire, said: 'The way the shark just exploded on to the surface gives me goose bumps thinking about it now.'I fought the fish with everything I had and was running on adrenaline by the end of it.'At one point I saw it under the boat and the size of it sent a shiver down my spine.'

Experts believe that shark is the biggest ever caught in British Waters. Weighing 550lbs (more than 39 stone), it easily beats the 507lbs record for the previous biggest shark caught off the north Scottish coast in 1993.
