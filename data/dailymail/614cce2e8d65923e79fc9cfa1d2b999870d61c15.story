An inquest into the death of a former nurse who underwent a gastric bypass operation was told today that surgeons may have made a crucial miscalculation during her weight-loss surgery.

Virginia Humphrey, from Brighton, lost ten stones in six months after the radical surgery at the University College Hospital London in August 2010.

Brighton County Court heard how the mother-of-three, who suffered from type two diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, was admitted to the hospital 'with vomiting and extreme weight loss' in May.

She was malnourished and her weight had dropped to eight stone by the time she was admitted for medical help.

Two days after the 67-year-old was 
admitted she died after the weight-loss procedure carried out at 
University College London Hospital in August 2010.

The inquest also heard that medics 
monitoring her progress after the surgery considered that the she had been doing 
well in the months following her treatment.

But an expert witness explained that surgeons may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure.

The inquest heard that it was possible that the common channel had been cut too short to be able to absorb food.

Surgeon Marcus Reddy explained to the court how the routine operation would have been performed by disconnecting and cutting the stomach and creating a newer smaller stomach, known as the gastric pouch.

He said this would allow food to bypass the original stomach completely but still be absorbed.

However trainee surgeon, James Hewes,
who carried out the operation alongside consultant bariatric surgeon 
Marco Adamo told the court that the operation had been carried out to 
'standard procedure' and that 'nothing unusual' took place.

Coroner Victoria Hamilton-Deeley 
added: 'It seems from all the evidence we've heard at the minute that 
something in the operation has gone wrong and this has resulted in 
malabsorption taking place and as a result Mrs Humphrey has died.

'It seems surgery in August had 
effectively gone awry in a way that resulted in her being unable to 
absorb nutrition appropriately or correctly.'

During questioning, Mr Adamo said 
that, if the operation had gone wrong, he would have expected Mrs 
Humphrey, known as Ginny, to have shown symptoms, such as diarrhoea, 
within weeks.

The inquest heard that her post-operative progress was what would have been expected until December.

Mrs Humphrey's GP, Dr Caroline 
Roberts, told the hearing that, when she saw her for the first time in 
March last year, her body mass index (BMI) was dangerously high at 47.6 
and, after talking to her about different ways of losing weight, she 
referred her to UCHL.

The retired Army nurse was then initially assessed by clinical specialist Emma Duke.

She told the inquest she first met 
Mrs Humphrey in May last year and felt that she did not fully understand
the operation that she would undergo.

However after further consultations 
with other experts at the hospital she was deemed to have passed the 
assessment and was given the go-ahead for surgery.

Mrs Duke said that divorcee Mrs 
Humphrey weighed 18st 10lb before the operation and that following the 
gastric bypass she passed on her mobile phone number and that of 
another nurse should she experience any difficulties.

At the same time she was given a timetable outlining how long she should consume only liquids and she could restart eating solids.

The grandmother's GP said that her 
patient had seemed 'very pleased with her surgery and very cheerful' and
that her blood pressure had dropped.

Her son Kevin, 47, said at the time of his mother's death that she 
had been desperate to lose weight before visiting her daughter in 
America but was 'extremely reluctant' to go under the knife.

The father-of-two said: 'She was questioning it right up until the last minute but eventually had it done.'

'She was being sick all the time. Everything she ate just came straight back up. It was heartbreaking to watch because she just kept trying to stay smiling and happy.

'She
was sure there was something wrong but when she was re-admitted to 
hospital for a couple of weeks she came home saying they thought it was 
in her imagination.

'Being
told there was nothing wrong, that it was a normal reaction to the 
surgery, made her lose confidence in herself and feel like she couldn’t 
keep asking.'

A spokesman for the University 
College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said shortly after her death: 'The trust very much
regrets Mrs Humphrey’s death and our sympathies are with her family.'
