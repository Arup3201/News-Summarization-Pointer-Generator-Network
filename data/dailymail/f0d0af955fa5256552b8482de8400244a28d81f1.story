TV regulator Ofcom has received around 100 complaints about daytime show This Morning after presenter Phillip Schofield confronted David Cameron with a list of alleged paedophiles, and is considering whether to launch an investigation.

Schofield yesterday handed the Prime Minister a list of names - understood to be Conservative Party figures - during the live show, put together from internet rumours.

The 'outrageous stunt' was widely criticised by politicians and the presenter was later forced to apologise after the list was briefly exposed on screen.

The Prime Minister takes the card and responds 
with firm words warning of a 'witch hunt' that meant prominent people 
were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay

Rob Wilson, a Conservative MP, 
reported the ITV1 programme to Ofcom and urged it to investigate whether
ITV breached its duty to give individuals a chance to respond before 
subjecting them to serious allegations on-screen.

The broadcasting regulator is 
understood to have had around 100 complaints by today and it will make a
decision about whether it should look into the matter within 15 working
days.

A spokesman for Ofcom said: 'We can 
confirm that we have received complaints about this issue, which we are 
assessing. No decision has been made at this stage to investigate.'

After being handed the list, which 
Schofield had assembled after trawling the internet for three minutes, 
the Prime Minister warned that internet discussions of an alleged 
paedophile ring could degenerate into a 'witch-hunt' against people who 
are gay.

Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green said Schofield's actions were 'tasteless and silly'.

Speaking on BBC1's Question Time last 
night he said: 'I think the stunt that Phillip Schofield pulled of 
presenting a list of names he had taken off the internet to the Prime 
Minister live on television was a tasteless and silly stunt and he 
should not have done it.

a surprise: Phillip Schofield, seated next to This Morning co-presenter
Holly Willoughby, picks up the list of alleged Tory paedophilesÂ  before
handing it back to Mr Cameron

This
was the extraordinary moment Philip Scholfield, who has now apologised 
for the stunt, handed the list of names to David Cameron

The Prime Minister was visibly taken aback by the stunt and some viewers said names were clearly visible on the piece of paper handed to the Prime Minister

'What the Prime Minister was warning 
about is that if we just start plastering names all over the place, of 
people against whom there may be no evidence, it may well turn into a 
witch-hunt and clearly because of the attitudes towards gay people at 
the time, in the 80s, many of them are likely to be on it.'

Schofield later apologised, saying: 'If any viewer was able to identify anyone listed, I would like to apologise and stress that was never my intention.

Mr Cameron had agreed to appear on This Morning to talk about dementia, including an event held at Downing Street today where he discuss the issue with TV presenter Fiona Phillips

Tory MP Rob Wilson wrote to Ofcom last night asking the media watchdog to investigate whether This Morning broke TV fairness rules

Mr Cameron had agreed to appear on 
This Morning to talk about dementia, including an event held at Downing 
Street today where he discuss the issue with TV presenter Fiona Phillips

'I was not accusing anyone of 
anything and it is essential that it is understood that I would never be
part of any kind of witch-hunt.

'Unfortunately there may have been a 
misjudged camera angle for a split second as I showed the Prime Minister
some information I had obtained from the internet.

After the TV showdown, Mr Cameron returned to Downing Street where he took a call from US President Barack Obama. He congratulated him on his his re-election

Steve Messham met with Welsh Secretary David Jones this week to discuss his claim he was abused by a senior Conservative while at the Bryn Estyn home in North Wales

'I asked for his reaction to give him
the opportunity to make a point which he very clearly made about the 
dangers of any witch-hunt.'

Asked if the Prime Minister planned to make a complaint to This Morning, his official spokesman said: 'I think the Prime Minister dealt with the issue at the time.'

Schofield was absent from today's 
edition of This Morning as he and co-host Holly Willoughby hand over 
presenting duties to Eamonn Holmes and his wife Ruth Langsford each 
Friday.

But the programme team emphasised they were not pointing the finger at anyone in particular.

Langsford reiterated to viewers 
Schofield's point about a 'misjudged camera angle' and she added: 'The 
programme was not accusing anyone of anything.'

Earlier shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper added her voice to condemnation of Schofield's actions.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today 
programme: 'Clearly the Prime Minister can't be expected to comment on 
individuals on live television. You can't have this being driven by 
internet frenzies. What you need is proper criminal investigations to 
get to the truth.'

Yesterday Tory MP Stuart Andrew denounced the presenter's ambush as 'completely irresponsible and an outrageous stunt'.

Downing Street later defended the decision to launch fresh inquiries into the abuse scandal, insisting 'a number' of serious allegations had been made.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman added: 'Serious allegations have been made about the conduct of the police inquiry and the subsequent public inquiry and it's right we look into those and that's what we are doing.

'I don't want to get into the speculation about particular individuals. The Prime Minister made the point he made yesterday, which is if there are allegations, if there is information about particular individuals, that information should be handed to the police.'

He added: 'People are questioning the conduct of a public inquiry. That is quite a serious thing. As you would expect, we take that seriously. We have not reopened the public inquiry. We have asked an independent person to review the scope and conduct of that inquiry.'
