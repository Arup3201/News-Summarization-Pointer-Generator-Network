In just a decade, the caterpillar of the horse chestnut leaf-mining moth has munched its way across most of England and Wales, turning leaves brown months early and shrinking conkers.

Scientists say there is no way of controlling the tiny but insatiable pest – and we will have to get used to seeing fewer horse chestnut trees.

The warning follows a project in which thousands of ‘citizen scientists’, including schoolchildren, helped researchers monitor the moth’s march.

Information from the volunteers showed that the Greek invader has spread to most of England and Wales since first being spotted in Wimbledon, south west London, in 2002.

The caterpillars, which are no bigger than a grain of rice, burrow through the leaves of conker trees, causing them to turn brown and autumnal in appearance, even in the height of summer.

Although this doesn’t kill the horse chestnut outright, there are fears about the long-term health of the trees which can live for several hundred years.

It is already known that the average conker has shrunk in size from 1.25 inches in diameter to just one inch.

One of the keys the pest’s success is the speed at which it breeds.

Within just one summer, a single female can give rise to 5,000 moths, and a tree will appear to shimmer with activity as the young emerge from their silken cocoons.

The citizen science project, reported in the journal PLoS ONE (MUST CREDIT), also revealed that it takes just three years from the first moth arriving in an area for the majority of horse chestnuts to turn brown before their time.

Michael Pocock, of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Oxfordshire, said: ‘It looks like autumn has come early.

‘They are going brown in August, rather than in November.’

Experiments done by the volunteers showed that although Britain does have parasitic wasps that prey on the caterpillars, there are not enough to them to keep the pests under control.

Dr Pocock said that ultimately, the disease could cause horse chestnuts to disappear.

This is because as the trees die from other causes, they are being replaced with other species because people don’t want to see ugly, brown pitted leaves.

The moth, which was first spotted in Macedonia, northern Greece in the 1970s, is a poor flier and is thought to hitch lifts on cars and lorries.

Dr Pocock, who worked with Hull University on the study, said: ‘There has been quite a lot of research money spent and scientists have had to say there is nothing that can be done to stop its spread.

‘Although, what is interesting is that it got to Newcastle in 2011 and doesn’t seem to have got any further north – I was expecting it to get to Scotland about two years ago. It hasn’t yet and I’m intrigued.’
