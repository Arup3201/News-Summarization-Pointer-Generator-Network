Controversial: Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has backed calls for the abortion limit to be cut to 12 weeks

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night made a provocative call for the abortion time limit to be slashed from 24 weeks to just 12 weeks.

Mr Hunt said he had not changed his mind since 2008, when as a member of the Shadow Cabinet he voted in the Commons to halve the upper limit at which a woman can opt for a termination.

As a newly appointed Health Secretary, many would have expected him to adopt a more independent line – but he has opted to be the first politician in the position for years to express such an extreme view.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) called the Health Secretary’s intervention ‘insulting to women’.

Earlier this week, new women’s minister Maria Miller also called for a reduction in the upper time limit, albeit to just 20 weeks.

In an interview with The Times newspaper, Mr Hunt denied that his stance was a consequence of his Christian beliefs. ‘Everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is, and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it,’ he said.

‘It’s just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start. I don’t think the reason I have that view is for religious reasons.’

Mr Hunt said it was for Parliament, not the Government, to determine the law on moral issues such as abortion.

‘There are some issues that cut across health and morality, a bit like capital punishment does for crime,’ he said.

About 91 per cent of abortions happen before 12 weeks. But opponents said a 12-week limit would effectively end testing for conditions such as Down’s syndrome.

RCOG spokeswoman Kate Guthrie said: ‘The politicisation of women’s health is absolutely shocking. Politicians talk about putting patients at the centre, which is quite right. How is the woman at the centre of her healthcare with something like this?

‘If everybody had to have abortions by 12 weeks, my worry would be that women would be rushed into making decisions. That’s an absolute shocker. You will absolutely create mental health problems if you start dragooning women into making decisions before they have to.’

Clare Murphy, head of public policy for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: ‘What’s disconcerting about people like Jeremy Hunt is that they don’t seem to understand why women would need later services. These are often vulnerable women.

‘They completely fail to engage with the reality of people’s lives and their take on science seems completely wrong.’

Downing Street sought to play down the provocative remarks. A source said: ‘Mr Hunt was expressing a personal view and there are no plans to make time in government business for a vote on the issue.

‘Given the strong views of most Labour and Lib Dem MPs against any reduction, whatever Tory MPs think it seems unlikely that there will be a change in the law.’

Last week, pro-choice activists delivered 600 coat hangers – used by desperate women to terminate their babies before 1967 when abortion was decriminalised – to Mr Hunt’s office to urge him to ditch his support for a lower time limit.

In an interview during the election campaign, David Cameron said: ‘My own view is that we do need to review the abortion limit.

‘I think that the way medical science and technology have developed in the past few decades mean that an upper limit of 20 or 22 weeks would be sensible.’

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Parliamentary practice is that any proposals to change abortion laws come from backbench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes.’
