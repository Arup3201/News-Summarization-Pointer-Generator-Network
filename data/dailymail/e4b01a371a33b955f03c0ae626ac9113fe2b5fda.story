Dorothy Lee Barnett disappeared with her 11-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994, only to be located and arrested in Australia this month after almost 20 years on the run.

As her extradition back to the U.S. to face kidnapping charges appears inevitable, information has emerged about the situation the troubled mother was in before she hatched a plan to flee the country.

According to Benjamin Harris Todd - Barnett's ex-husband and the father of Savanna Harris Todd, who has been living in Queensland, Australia, under the name Samantha Geldenhuys - he took Barnett to court before the birth of their baby because of her worrying behavior.

In a little-seen interview with Columbia Journalism School from 2009, Todd - a successful investment banker who lives in the exclusive ocean-side S.C. suburb of Isle of Palms - said he divorced Barnett citing 'physical cruelty'.

He said there marriage was impromptu, with a planned vacation to the Bahamas quickly refashioned as a honeymoon, and that soon after his wife his wife turned violent.

Todd alleged Barnett would attack him while driving in their car.

He said she wouldn't sleep for 'seven or eight days at a stretch' and would 'beat her head against a wall for what seemed like hours.

One night, he awoke to find her lying in a fetal position on the floor, staring at nothing, rocking back and forth.

A long way from South Carolina: Savanna Harris Todd and her mother Dorothy Lee Burnett have been living on the Sunshine Coast, in the Australian state of Queensland, for at least the last four years under fake names. They had been officially listed as missing persons since 1994 until Barnett was arrest on November 4

Then and now: Savanna Harris Todd has remained a missing person for 19 years after being kidnapped by her mother in April 1994. Pictures of her as a baby (left) were used to create impressions of what she might look like today (right). On November 4, Savanna was located in Queensland, Australia, living under the name Samantha with her mother, Dorothy Lee Barnett, who has been charged with three federal offenses

'I've never hit a woman in my life,' Todd said.

'I can't explain why I let myself be hit.'

In February 1993, after two years together, Todd left Barnett, who was pregnant with their daughter.

He went into hiding and would sometimes sleep in his car.

I was on the run from her, hiding out at friends' houses. She'd drive around all night, looking for me, and sometimes she'd find me. She'd stand outside the house and scream that she was going to kill herself."

He would later testify in court about her behavior: how she wouldn't sleep for seven or eight days at a stretch; how she would beat her head against a wall for what seemed like hours.

Or while he was driving their car, she would turn to him during an argument and start pummeling the side of his head.

"I've never hit a woman in my life," Todd says. "And I can't explain why I let myself be hit."

In February 1993, after two years together, they separated and Todd moved out. She claimed desertion; Todd, in filing for divorce the following month, claimed physical cruelty.

By then, Barnett was pregnant with Savanna.

He went into hiding, to escape what he called her endless tirades and threats. Sometimes, he slept in his car.

'I was on the run from her, hiding out at friends' houses. She'd drive around all night, looking for me, and sometimes she'd find me. She'd stand outside the house and scream that she was going to kill herself.'

Barnett was diagnosed with manic 
depression - now largely classified as bi-polar disorder - but refused 
to get treatment, so Todd commenced custody proceedings, which carried 
over after the birth of Savanna.

Barnett's lawyer, Mendell Rivers,
said Barnett's 'tragic lack of self-control' in the court room lead the
judge to believe the accusations were true.

In court she claimed Todd was evil and suspected he was homosexual.

But the stress of the trial and the stress of being a mother was 'too much for her to handle', Rivers said.

Todd was granted sole custody, with Barnett to have two supervised weekend visits a month.

Dorothy Lee Barnett (pictured left in the early 1990s and right in an artists impression of her today) lost custody of her daughter Savanna to her ex-husband Benjamin Harris Todd because tests showed her to be bi-polar. Barnett and Savanna disappeared from South Carolina in 1994 but have now been found in Australia following almost 20 years on the run. Barnett has been charged and faces extradition to the U.S.

It was during her fifth visitation, on April 22, 1994, that Barnett and Savanna dissappeared without a trace.

It's
believed Barnett enlisted the help of Faye Yager, owner of an 
organization called Children of the Underground, which helps women 
escape abusive relationships.

Yager uses her 'contacts' to 
securely hide the women - getting friends to make small credit card 
transactions all over the world, driving their car to somewhere random, 
and leaving behind misleading 'clues'.

Barnett had left behind a map of South America, however its believed she first fled to South Africa.

When
approached on why she would help Barnett, considering there was no 
evidence Todd had been abusive, Yeger said the case was 'exceptional'.

Now, Barnett, 53, has been arrested 
by Australian Federal Police on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland after 
living under several aliases.

Savanna,
now 20, who has been living under the name Samantha, was by her mothers
side during a court appearance on Wednesday, where Barnett was denied 
bailed.

According to The 
Australian, Savanna - who has been studying nursing at a Queensland 
university - held up a sign during the hearing saying 'We love you Mom'.

Barnett,
who 'winked' back at her daughter, was supported by over two dozen 
people, some of whom had sworn affidavits attesting to her good 
character.

Barnett's 
barrister, Jeff Hunter QC, said his client was not a flight risk and had
a close and special relationship with the Sunshine Coast community.

She has maintained a job while in Australia and managed to get a mortgage on her home.

Barnett
was charged with international parental kidnapping and two counts of 
false statement in a passport application after being captured on 
November 4.

Barnett will be extradited back to the United States to face her charges.

According
to Queensland news reports, Barnett initially fled to South Africa, 
where she married a man, Juan Geldenhuys, in 1995 and later gave birth 
to a son, now 17, before moving to New Zealand and becoming a citizen.

Five years ago she settled in Australia after splitting with Mr Geldenhuys, who recently died of bone cancer.

During
her alleged time on the run, Barnett used aliases such as Alexandria 
Maria Canton, federal authorities said, to evade detection.

Once in March 2003 and again in March 2004, Barnett used her new name, Alexandria Maria Geldenhuys, to attempt to get a U.S. passport, according to the indictment against her.

Court papers say Savanna's father was the one who lead authorities to find his ex-wife.

An Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Barnett's second husband, had grown suspicious of her.

He heard Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship.

A simple internet search provided old photos of Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna, and the Australian man was able to contact Benjamin Harris Todd.

Outside court this week, Savanna- Samantha - would not comment when approached by reporters.

But in an affidavit tendered to the court, Savanna described Barnett as 'an amazing woman, having raised both myself and my brother and always giving us the support we needed to become the people that we are'.

Barnett, a flight attendant, and Todd got married in December 1991 in Beaufort.

She filed for divorce in February 1993, alleging in court documents that Todd had left her because he was angry about her being pregnant, reports The Post and Courier.

Todd countered, saying Barnett physically and emotionally abused him.

That month, Todd was given temporary custody of his unborn daughter after psychiatric tests showed Barnett to be bi-polar.

Savanna was born May 6, 1993.

During a court-supervised visit in April 1994, the two left for a birthday party without an escort and never returned, the police reported at the time.

Barnett’s disappearance prompted a probe by the FBI, which obtained a warrant for her arrest in April 1994.

Artists created images depicting what Savanna and Barnett would look like as the years went on.

If convicted of the charges she is facing, Barnett could spend three years in prison on the kidnapping charge and 10 years on each of the two passport counts.

Barnett will next appear at an extradition hearing in Australia.
