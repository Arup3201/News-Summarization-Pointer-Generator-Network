Amazing images have been emerged of the moment a mammoth saltwater crocodile shattered a dead sea turtle's shell out on a remote beach in the Northern Territory.

Ranger Dani Best first discovered the Olive Ridley Sea Turtle washed up on shore two weeks ago, killed by a ghost net.

She cut the endangered species out of the net and placed a wildlife monitoring camera, which captured a number of animals coming in for a free feed.

But the footage also showed the powerful pressure of a crocodile's bite as it crushed the outer layer of the turtle in order to gain access to the meaty goods.

Ms Best was collecting rubbish along the coast at Garig Gunak Barlu National Park on the Cobourg Peninsula, east of Darwin, when she found the turtle - also known as the Lepidochelys olivacea.

According to Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife, the sea creature is a threatened species.

Crocodylus Park owner Grahame Webb told NT News the forceful bite of a crocodile is about three tonnes.

'No other animal on the planet has a comparable bite force to a crocodile,'  he said.

Ms Best along with other rangers cut the dead turtle out of the net then planted a camera to film Cobourg wildlife eating the deceased reptile.

Among those animals include the saltwater croc and a Beach Stone-curlew, which is a large ground-dwelling bird.
