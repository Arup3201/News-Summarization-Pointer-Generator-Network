Australia spinner Xavier Doherty has described Jonathan Agnew’s comments about his side’s on-field conduct since the death of Phillip Hughes as ‘pretty touchy’.

BBC cricket correspondent Agnew penned an article in the Radio Times chiding the Australians for their sledging and behaviour in a tense Test series against India. 

He suggested they had acted contrary to the pledge made by captain Michael Clarke to honour the memory of former team-mate Hughes, who was killed in November after being hit by a bouncer.

Clarke never overtly called for an end to sledging but Agnew believes flashpoints in the India series represented a missed opportunity to improve standards. 

Doherty said: ‘I think sledging has been a part of cricket for a long time and as long as it’s above board and all fair it always will be.

‘The Phil Hughes memory, I’m not too sure about — it’s a pretty touchy one to cast it under that.’

Agnew responded: ‘The first thing I need to make clear is that my remarks are not critical of Michael Clarke.

‘But the verbal abuse, the posturing, the unnecessary gesturing appeared to be every bit as bad as ever (in the Australia-India series).

‘The ICC plans to bring in new, strict anti-sledging regulations in time for the World Cup which, I am assured, will have the same zero-tolerance as the recent purge on throwing.

‘But it is a shame the players have not felt prompted to act for themselves.’
