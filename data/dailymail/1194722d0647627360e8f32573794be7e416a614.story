Hull have been fined £30,000 by the Football Association for failing to control their players against Leicester on March 14. 

City initially denied the charge but were on Friday found guilty of 'failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion'.

The incident was brought about by the reaction of a number of Hull players after Alex Bruce was booked by referee Jon Moss following a tackle on Riyad Mahrez.

The findings are something of an embarrassment for Hull, whose manager Steve Bruce criticised the Leicester players for their conduct during the nervy 0-0 draw.

He was unimpressed by what he perceived to be attempts to persuade Moss to penalise his son.

'I saw everyone surround Alex (asking) for a red card for his challenge,' he said in the post-match press conference.

'The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we're going to go down the route of every other league - jumping around and whingeing and trying to get people yellow and red cards - for me that's not right.'

Hull were handed six bookings in the match, two of which led to Tom Huddlestone's sending-off.

Foxes boss Nigel Pearson tersely described Bruce's version as 'not a fair assessment' and the FA's independent regulatory commission were in agreement, attributing blame to the Hull contingent.

Their statement read: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing, Hull City have been fined £30,000 after an FA player misconduct charge brought against the club was found proven.

'It was alleged that in or around the 68th minute of the game against Leicester City on 14 March 2015, Hull failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion.

'The club denied the charge which was found proven by the Regulatory Commission.'
