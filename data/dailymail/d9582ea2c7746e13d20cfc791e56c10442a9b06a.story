A university graduate today relived the terrifying moment he was stabbed repeatedly in the back by a 'joker' obsessed bodybuilder.

Fuelled by voices of Batman’s joker, paranoid schizophrenic Dale Pipe attacked Joshua Henley with a filleting knife.

He stabbed him repeatedly in the back and neck, after he was picked 'at random' in the gym changing area as he used a urinal.

Scarred: Joshua's ear was partially cut off. 'The knife broke my left shoulder in various places. It went straight through me,' he said today

Joshua, 22, today told of the moment, covered in blood, he managed to turn to face his attacker.

'We were just about nose to nose and I will never forget the look in his eyes,' he said.

'You wouldn’t see a look like that in anybody’s eyes in a film, or hopefully in real life, anywhere ever.

'I knew it was bad when I turned around and the blood was pouring out my neck.

Pipe was obsessed with the Joker (pictured) and after stabbing Mr Henley posted: 'Why so serious?' on Facebook - a line from The Dark Knight

'It was like an animal look in his eyes. He just wouldn’t take his eyes off mine.'

The
 21-year-old attacker, who was armed with an axe and a selection of ten 
other knives, struck at the Bellevue Leisure Centre in Consett, County 
Durham.

After he was 
barricaded into a toilet cubicle he sent out a Facebook post saying 'Why
 so serious?' - the catch phrase of the fictional hero’s nemesis and 
identified himself as 'The Joker'.

Yesterday
 Pipe was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at Newcastle Crown 
Court after pleading guilty to attempted murder and having offensive 
weapons.

Joshua managed to fight off his attacker by head-butting him and then staggered into the gym reception area where he collapsed.

'If there was any point when I thought I was going to die that was it,' he said.

I was basically fighting with an ear chopped off, 16 stab wounds and two broken shoulders.'

Joshua had never met his attacker before and there were no words spoken prior to the sudden and unprovoked stabbing

The
 graduate said: 'To make himself appear like the Joker, as far as I’m 
concerned, is something that he failed in doing because he hasn’t 
frightened me.

'I wanted to 
see him in court to show him he’s not scared me at all. He might have 
hurt me temporarily but I am on the road to being back where I was 
before.

'My ear got partially cut off. The knife broke my left shoulder in various places. It went straight through me.

'It
 went in my neck and out the back of my neck. I was stabbed in the arm. 
The wound was about eight inches long. I was stabbed in the left leg, 
stabbed in the stomach, stabbed in the head and straight across where 
your spine is and low down in the abdomen.

Pipe waited for an hour before choosing Joshua Henley to attack at Belle Vue Leisure Centre (pictured)

'I got stabbed in the face, which I didn’t realise till I got to hospital.'

Joshua said he believes Pipe would have gone on to kill others that day had gym workers not stepped in to help.

He
 added: 'The only reason he backed off was because he had no 
alternative. He couldn’t get out of my grip and other people would have 
got involved at some point. He took the easy way out in my  opinion.

'I was losing blood left, right and centre, quite literally, it was pretty surreal.' 

High security: Judge James Goss detained Pipe indefinitely at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday

Only
 Joshua’s developed muscle mass protected his vital organs from the 
knife. When police later went to Pipe’s home more knives and a haul of 
violent films were found.

At
 Newcastle Crown Court on Wednesday Judge James Goss QC sentenced Pipe, 
of Thornfield Road, Consett, to an indefinite hospital order, calling 
him a 'very dangerous young man'.

The
 court heard that Pipe, a former chef, has had auditory hallucinations 
since the age of 14, the most influential of which was the joker.

Whilst
 in prison, Pipe, who has since been diagnosed with paranoid 
schizophrenia, mutilated himself in the face, after the 'voice' 
persuaded him to carve a joker face into his own.

Mr Henley spent six hours in surgery and 12 days in hospital after the attack.
