Police have exhumed more bodies from a mass grave in Mexico, bringing the tally to 62.

Mexican law enforcement officers began excavating 28 graves in the town of La Barca in Jalisco earlier this month.

The mass burial was uncovered during a search for two missing police officers who were involved in a federal investigation.

The officers have been missing since November 3.

According to Al Jazeera, investigators questioned almost two dozen police officers who confessed to working with drug cartels and led agents to the grave site.

Authorities have not yet released the identities of any of the victims or confirmed whether the two officers are among the dead.

According to the Latinos Post, two of the bodies discovered were female and one was a minor. All were marked with a tattooed red cross, a symbol used by the Knights Templar cartel.

CNN reports that the bodies show 
signs of having been bound, gagged and tortured and many died from blunt
force trauma or gunshot wounds.

The grim discovery is only the most recent of a series of atrocities committed in an area where drug cartels battle for turf.

In the border town of La Barca between Jalisco and Michoacan, locals have formed militia self-defense groups in response to the terrifying escalation of violence between rival drug cartels the Knights Templar and the New Generation.

Drug cartels and police corruption are rife in parts of Mexico and the border area between Jalisco and Michoacan has emerged as a new hotspot for drug-related violence.

Last month, 11 towns were left without power after a coordinated attack by gangs on power stations throughout the state.

During the same period, the entire police force in the Michoacan port of Lazaro Cadenas was dismissed
