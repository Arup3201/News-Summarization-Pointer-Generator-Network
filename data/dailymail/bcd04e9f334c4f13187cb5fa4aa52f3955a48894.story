The orthodontic braces that have plagued teens for decades have become spring's most surprising new beauty trend.

The once dreaded orthodontia was seen on the catwalk last month during New York Fashion Week, while CR Fashion Book's Editor-in-Chief Carine Roitfeld had 17-year-old model Kitty Hayes flaunt her mouth full of metal on the cover of the magazine's latest issue.

'After putting Beyoncé on my cover last season, I knew there was no way to top the most famous and beautiful woman in the world,' she told WWD. 'So I went in the opposite direction: I chose my favorite fresh faces of the season…girls who are mostly unknown but have a special quality that sets them apart, like big ears or a strange smile.'

She continued: 'To me, these models are fascinating because of their imperfections. They represent the new guard of jolie laide - my way of seeing beauty for 2015.' 

And Kitty isn't the only teen model sporting orthodontia. 

Last month, New York Times style reporter Matthew Schneier shared a photo of British model Charlie James, 17, smiling and displaying his braces at Opening Ceremony's fall/winter 2015 show. 

'Newbie model Charlie James, 17. His braces won't come off till he's 20. I'm encouraging him to make that his brand,' Mr Schneier captioned the picture.

Meanwhile, Hood by Air designer Shayne Oliver put his own spin on the teeth straightening devices by sending his models down the runway wearing grills with braces and locks.

Even though the fashion industry seems to be embracing orthodontia with opens arms, it's not always easy being a model with a mouth full of metal.

Kitty revealed to CR Fashion Book that the metal wiring and power blue bands that she so proudly shows off for the magazines sixth issue were also the cause of her most embarrassing moment.

'Recently I had a really important casting but when I came out I looked in the mirror and found that I had spinach in my braces!' she explained. 'I was so embarrassed and everyone would have seen it.'

Although braces may be this season's newest trend, celebrities have been sporting their teeth straightening orthodontia on the red carpet for years.

Gwen Stefani, Faith Hill, Tom Cruise and Faye Dunaway are among the A-listers who have been photographed wearing braces at some point in their careers.

Gwen explained to Harper's Bazaar in 2012 that braces were a gift that she gave herself when No Doubt made it big.

'I always told myself when I got rich, that's the first thing I'd do,' she said.
