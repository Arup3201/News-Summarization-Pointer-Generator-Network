Read Martin Samuel's match report from Anfield as the Reds crashed out of the Champions League 

Liverpool were eliminated from the Champions League after they were held in their Group B clash against Basle.

Fabian Frei gave the Swiss side a shock lead before the break when he was allowed time and space to fire past Simon Mignolet.

The Reds needed a win to progress but they had substitute Lazar Markovic sent off early in the second half.

Steven Gerrard scored a stunning free-kick to give them hope, but they couldn't find another goal.

Liverpool (4-2-3-1) 

Simon Mignolet 6

Didn't have any chance with Frei's strike and just doesn't fill his back-four with confidence.

Glen Johnson 5.5 

A good shop window opportunity for Johnson who can talk to overseas clubs from next month. Didn't take advantage though.

Dejan Lovren 6 

Probably his most impressive performance in a red shirt. Commanding at the back. Booked for foul on Xhaka.

Martin Skrtel 6.5

Given a tough test by the dangerous and mobile  Gashi. Never went missing though, got blocks in and tried to help his strikers with some good shooting.

Jose Enrique 4

Had one of those nights where everything went wrong. Was targeted by Basle and caught in possession repeatedly.

Lucas 5.5

Gets around the pitch alright but in a game that Liverpool needed to win, his lack of creativity is obvious.

Joe Allen 5.5

One of Brendan Rodgers' first signings and meant to usher in a new way at Anfield. Neat and tidy but too lightweight.

Raheem Sterling 5.5

You can see when he moves with pace and balance he's a player. But his end product is not good enough at the moment.

Steven Gerrard 7

His legs aren't as mobile as in yesteryear but his quality on the ball is still outstanding as his equalising free-kick showed. It was his 100th goal for Liverpool at Anfield

Jordan Henderson 5

His early-season form is a distant memory. Played on the left and the continual changing of positions are affecting him.

Rickie Lambert 5.5

The whole move to hometown club Liverpool is proving a disaster. Even some of the crowd are getting on his back when he doesn't hold the ball up.

Subs:

Markovic 5 (for Lambert 45). His big chance, started very well and then sent off for flicking his fingers into the face of Behrang Safari.

Lazar Markovic was harshly sent off shortly after coming off the bench 

Moreno 5 (for Enrique 45) He wasn't Enrique and that is worth an extra point in itself.

Coutinho (for Lucas 74)

Unused subs: 

Jones (Gk), Sakho, Coutinho, Lallana, Can

Goal:

Gerrard 81

Booked: 

Lovren, Lucas. 

Sent off: 

Markovic

Brendan Rodgers saw his Liverpool side knocked out of the Champions League

Brendan Rodgers 5.5 

Left out a lot of his signings, sent two of them on at the interval only for Markovic to be sent off.

Referee Bjorn Kuipers 6

Liverpool will feel aggrieved at Behrang Safari making a meal of Markovic's finger-jab, earning the winger a red card.

Basle (3-2-3-2): Vaclik 6.5; Schar 6, Suchy 6.5, Safari 5.5; Elneny 6, Frei 7; Xhaka 7, Zuffi 7.5, Gashi 6; Gonzalez 6, Streller 6 (Embolo 74)

Booked: 

Schar 

Goal:

Frei 25
