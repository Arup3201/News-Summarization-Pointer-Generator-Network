The world's biggest party burst into life as the Rio Carnival got underway with a breathtaking parade of giant floats and samba dancers.

The Carnival competition sees the city's top samba groups parade in the Sambadrome, each delivering an over-the-top, hour-long display aimed at capturing the annual title.

Imperio da Tijuca,
 the school that opened this year's competition, put on a African theme, with a huge crab-shaped float.

Mangueira, one of the most famous schools known for its 
distinctive green and pink colors, turned to Carnival itself for a 
parade that feted Brazil's traditional celebrations in a sea of salmon 
pink and lime green feathers.

Each samba 
school is judged in 10 categories, from the quality of the drum sections
 to the beauty of the costumes. Whichever group comes in last falls from
 the top-tier competition into a lower category contest.

The competition
 continues Monday night with displays by six additional schools.
