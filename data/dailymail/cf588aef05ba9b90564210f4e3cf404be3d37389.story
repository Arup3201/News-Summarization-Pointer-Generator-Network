Grand Theft Auto V, one of the most eagerly-anticipated video game releases is expected to smash sales records after going on sale worldwide today.

Stores across the UK opened their doors at midnight for the special launch of Grand Theft Auto V, which reportedly cost around £170 million to make and market and retails at £35.

Online seller Amazon has already sold out of the game and copies have started appearing 
on eBay, with some sellers asking in excess of £90 for the standard 
version and £170 for the Collector's Edition.

Awfully popular: One day after its release, Grand Theft Auto V had made a record $800 million in sales

Zohair Ali from London, pictured, was the first in the queue to pick up a copy of Grand Theft Auto V at the flagship Game store in Westfield Stratford City in London. Gaming site IGN.com discovered that 46 per cent of fans said they booked the day off as holiday to get their hands on the game

Experts estimate it could generate £1 billion during its first year on sale when gamers are predicted to snap up some 25 million copies - breaking current records.

Grand Theft Auto V has received rave reviews from critics across the board who have labelled it 'one of the very best video games ever made.'

But the launch of the latest iteration in the Grand Theft Auto series has not gone as smoothly as planned.

The
 Scottish creator Rockstar launched an investigation into whether 
copies of the game were dispatched days ahead of its official release.

Some gamers claimed to have received their copies as early as Friday following Amazon deliveries.

Fans expressed their delight on Twitter where one user wrote: 'Thank you Mum and Amazon GTA 5 here today. So excited.' 

MailOnline's gaming expert Talal Musa awarded the game five stars: 'This is clearly a well-thought-out and 
intelligent title - a far cry from the meaningless violence many wrongly
 (and unfairly) infer from its 'Grand Theft Auto' label.

'The visuals excel in both art design and graphical fidelity. From deep-sea diving to dog fighting 
in the skies, every inch of GTA V's world has been given equal,
 immaculate care and attention.

'Every 
excursion is a surprise, and coupled with an improved check-pointing 
mechanism - you're now no longer punished for attempting missions in 
different ways.

'Cars all 'feel' different, and have 
lost the wayward steering that plagued the last game.

Missions no longer stick to the oft 
rigid GTA formula of driving somewhere and shooting something.'

Stuff Magazine's Guy Cocker wrote: 'Grand Theft Auto V aims ridiculously high and despite those ethical missteps manages to deliver on all of its towering ambitions.

'It’s a game that pushes the boundaries not only of what’s possible in open world games, but what’s possible on the current generation of consoles.

'In GTA V, the incredibly detailed world, compelling characters and varied missions combine to create an experience that will live on in your memory long after you've finished playing.'

The Metro's David Jenkins added: 'A staggering technical achievement that is matched only by the depth and ambition of its gameplay – this is not only the best-looking GTA ever but by far the most fun to play.

'Impossibly good visuals, in terms of scope and attention to detail. Excellent and varied mission design. Great car handling and much improved gunplay.

Yet wasn't entirely positive: 'The story is as vague and meandering as usual, with not a single virtuous character in the whole cast. Gunplay could still be better and helicopters are a pain.'

Keza MacDonald, games editor at 
IGN.com, said: 'Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously 
enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire 
of contemporary America,' she added.

'It represents a refinement of 
everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It's 
technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it's also 
tremendously ambitious in its own right.

'No
 other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and 
there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for 
mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story 
without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed 
adventures through San Andreas.

Another
 joked: 'I refuse to disclose whether Amazon has dispatched my pre-order
 copy of GTA early in case it prevents them from doing so again in the 
future.'

Edinburgh-based Rockstar said it was looking into how any copies of the game may have been released early.

'We are in the process of investigating early 'sales' to determine how and why that is occurring,' a spokesman told the Games Industry International website.'

In a message on its website, Amazon warned any orders placed after last Friday may not arrive until after today's release date because of high demand.

'Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox 360)--Stock Update. Please note--due to high demand, orders placed for Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox 360) from September 13 will be shipped as soon as we receive inventory.'

Around a quarter of the poll participants who owned gaming devices said they were likely to buy Grand Theft Auto V, pictured, when the new consoles come out. While 22 per cent said they would pick up a copy of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Ghosts game

Tom Butler, social media editor of gaming site IGN.com, said thousands of workers have taken the day off for the launch or plan on calling in sick.

'Grand Theft Auto V will be the biggest entertainment launch of the year and possibly all-time with levels of consumer anticipation outstripping Harry Potter and Twilight,' he said.

'With gamers queuing at midnight to be among the first to play and the developer boasting thousands of hours of game play, there's no surprise that we're likely to see an outbreak of GTA flu this September.'

Shoppers arrive at HMV in Wimbledon, London, to buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto V at midnight. Copies of the game are already selling on eBay in excess of £90, despite retailing for £35

The gaming site polled 10,995 readers to ask whether they would take time off work today when the GTA V goes on sale.

According to its findings, 5,059 readers (46 per cent) said they booked the day off as holiday.

Another 2,012 (19 per cent) said they would phone in claiming to be unwell while 3,884 (35 per cent) said they would wait to get their hands on the game.

The Grand Theft Auto series has accumulated sales of 135 million copies since its 1997 debut.

GTA IV has reportedly sold more than 25 million copies since its 2008 release.
