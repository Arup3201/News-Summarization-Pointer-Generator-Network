Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has added his voice to a chorus of disapproval aimed at the Millennium Stadium boo-boys.

Fly-half Rhys Priestland will line up against Fiji on Saturday just a week after he was jeered when he replaced an injured Dan Biggar early in the second period during Wales' 33-28 loss to Australia.

The booing came from a small minority of home supporters, and their behaviour has subsequently been condemned by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and Priestland's squad colleagues.

Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards hit back strongly at the Welsh supporters who booed Rhys Priestland 

And Edwards has now told those fans: 'You boo one of us, you boo all of us.'

The protest at Priestland has prompted an angry response from within the Wales camp, and Edwards hit back strongly on Thursday.

'With Rhys Priestland, it is important to remember that most of the crowd is behind us, but you boo one of us, you boo all of us,' Edwards said.

'If you boo Rhys Priestland, you boo myself, you boo Warren Gatland, you boo Leigh Halfpenny, you boo the Welsh jersey. Personally, I don't think that is on.

'Over the last number of years we have performed admirably as a Welsh nation, with only 20,000 players and three million people, we've tried to wear that Welsh shirt with a lot of pride.

'For someone to boo that shirt, to be honest, I am not very happy about it.

Wales: Liam Wililams; Alex Cuthbert, Scott Williams, Jamie Roberts, George North; Rhys Priestland, Mike Philips; Gethin Jenkins (C), Scott Baldwin, Samson Lee; Bradley Davies, Luke Charteris; Dan Lydiate, Justin Tipuric, Taulupe Faletau 

Reserves: Emyr Philips, Nicky Smith, Rhodri Jones, Alun Wyn Jones, James King, Rhodri Williams, James Hook, Cory Allen 

'If people are around those people in the crowd, and they are silly enough to do it again, I would like to think that the rest of the crowd would let them know what they think about them.'

Asked if he felt if rugby crowd behaviour had changed much in recent years, Edwards added: 'We don't want this booing going on.

'What has always been fantastic about rugby is that it has always been a family game. You can take your wife and kids along, and we don't want it to be dragged down at all.

'You can have a vociferous crowd against you, but at the end of the game, both teams are clapped, which I think is very important. The dignity of rugby must be upheld.

'The thing about rugby is that it is a dignified game. All the aggression comes out on the pitch, not from the crowd.

'The crowd are there to enjoy and have a fantastic day. You go to a game of rugby, you can have a pint, you can take your children and feel that you are absolutely safe, and long may that continue.'

Priestland will be part of a much-changed Wales team from the Walllabies clash, but one that should still be good enough to win comfortably ahead of next week's Millennium Stadium appointment with world champions New Zealand.
