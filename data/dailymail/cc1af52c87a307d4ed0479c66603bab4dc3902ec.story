The little girl had probably only been in the village pub’s toilet for a few minutes.

So when she emerged to find her mother and father and others in their party had vanished from the bar and outside she was naturally a little bemused.

'Where are my parents?' the eight-year-old asked staff at The Plough.

Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him

They were clearly nowhere to be seen and had obviously left without her.

But thankfully the landlord was well 
aware where these particular parents might be… because they were David 
and Samantha Cameron.

Publican Stephen Hollings yesterday 
recounted details of Nancy Cameron’s unfortunate adventure as Downing 
Street gave a full version of 'The Day The Prime Minister and His Wife 
Accidentally Left Their Daughter Behind In A Pub'.

Eldest child Nancy became separated 
from her parents after visiting the toilets as the family prepared to 
leave the village gastropub close to the Prime Minister’s country 
retreat, Chequers.

Mr and Mrs Cameron, who were 
travelling in separate cars, each believed Nancy was with the other and 
were 'distraught' to discover she was missing when they reached 
Chequers.

Mrs Cameron, 41, who also has 
children Arthur, six, and Florence, 22 months, swiftly returned to the 
pub and was reunited with her daughter within 15 minutes.

Error: The Plough pub, where the Camerons accidentally left their daughter Nancy when they drove off in separate cars

Easy: The Plough is a short drive away from Chequers, pictured

Yesterday, as the Camerons faced 
criticism over the blunder, Mr Hollings described the PM as 'a great 
father and genuine family man'.

Mr Hollings, the former husband of 
Carry On actress Barbara Windsor, said the family were regular visitors 
to his pub, The Plough at Cadsden, a Buckinghamshire hamlet a few miles 
from Chequers, and described the couple and their children as 'charming'.

He said: 'The Camerons had been 
sitting outside with two other family groups who seemed to be personal 
friends. Mr Cameron just had a pint of bitter and then they all left.

'Then Nancy came out of the toilets 
and said something like: “Where are my parents?” We knew who Nancy was 
and looked after her until she was collected.'

An insider at the pub added: 'I know 
there were a lot of children there that day but I still don’t quite 
understand how they lost their daughter in such a small pub and then 
drove off without her. You would have thought the security officers 
would do a head count.'

Chillaxing? David Cameron enjoys a pint during a visit to a brewery

In a new biography, friends of Mr 
Cameron last month told how he enjoyed drinking 'three or four glasses 
of wine' over lunch at the weekend, while one source told the authors: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for "chillaxing", the Prime Minister
 would win it.'

Mr Hollings yesterday denied any suggestion that Mr Cameron had more than a single drink.

A senior Downing Street source said 
the incident happened when the three families returned to Chequers in a 
convoy of cars. He said: 'David grabbed five children and Samantha did 
the same. It was not a case of each family travelling back in a certain 
car.

'Nancy had wandered away. But she is a
 clever girl and revealed herself to the landlady. Nancy had a whale of a
 time helping the landlady. They go to the pub regularly and [staff] 
know the Camerons well.'

He said the incident happened 'two or
 three months ago' after the three families had walked the two miles 
from Chequers for pre-lunch drinks at the pub.

The spokesman said that was something of a 'ritual' each Sunday, before the group would drive back to Chequers for lunch.

As if to illustrate the point, the 
family visited the pub again on Sunday, with Mr Cameron spotted carrying
 a small child in a backpack-style baby carrier.

Clare Bonnick, 51, said
 she was visiting the pub with a walking group when the Camerons and a 
couple of other families walked in.

Mrs Bonnick said they arrived on foot but left in three black cars, apparently driven by protection officers.

She added: 'There were about six 
adults and at least as many children and they were all getting into 
different cars. It was easy to see how they could have lost one of the 
children.'

Pub regular Norman Meade, 89, said 
he often saw Mr Cameron at The Plough on a Saturday – usually enjoying a
 drink with just his police protection officer for company.

Mr Meade added: 'He’s a decent bloke 
who will come over and shake my hand. But how could  you do that? Walk 
away and leave  a baby?'

Parents on website Mumsnet also expressed surprise at Mr  Cameron’s forgetfulness.

One wrote: 'I don’t understand how this could happen when they surely have police protection officers with them.'
