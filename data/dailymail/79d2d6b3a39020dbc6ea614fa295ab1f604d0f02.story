'Charismatic': Former Army Sergeant Major Dean Henderson-Smith, 46, died after falling through a barn roof

A former Army Sergeant Major who served in Iraq and Afghanistan has died after falling through a barn skylight on a farm.

Sergeant Major Dean Henderson-Smith, 46, had been working on the roof when he plunged to his death.

He was flown to hospital by air ambulance helicopter but was declared dead shortly afterwards.

Today his grieving partner Sacha paid tribute to the former soldier, describing him as 'my soul mate, best friend, partner and ray of light'.

She added: 'We shared a common love for each other which made us "us" and our special bond will last forever.

'What little time I had with my sweetheart was filled with happiness, love and joy and I will hold those memories in my heart forever.

'Our dreams and ambitions I promise to fulfil in time.'

Mr Henderson-Smith's stepson Jake said: 'There is no definitive way to describe my dad.

'I can confidently say that he was the happiest, bubbliest, most charismatic man I have ever met.

'As a father I could have asked for nothing more. He was caring, generous, kind, loving and honest.

'The list is infinite. Not only have I lost my dad, I have lost my best friend.'

Mr Henderson-Smith was 18 when he joined the former Royal Corps of Transport. This later became the Royal Logistic Corps and he was based at Abingdon.

As well as Iraq and Afghanistan, he served in Germany, Kuwait, Bosnia and Northern Ireland during a 22-year military career.

Thames Valley Police and the Health and Safety Executive have begun a joint investigation into his fall, which happened on a farm in the Oxfordshire village of Besselsleigh on October 18.

Detective Inspector Steve Raffield said: 'This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the manâ€™s family at this time.

'We will now conduct a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident alongside the Health and Safety Executive.'
