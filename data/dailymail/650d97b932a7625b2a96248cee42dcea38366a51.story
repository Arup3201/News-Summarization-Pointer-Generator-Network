Old friend? Daniel Bartelt, 19, is accused of the murder of Jessie Blodgett, also 19, who was found strangled in her bed. The two dated in high school in Hartford, Wisconsin and had been spending time together

A 19-year-old woman was found dead and strangled in her own bed in Hartford, Wisconsin July 15 and now 
her young friend is charged in her murder.

Jessie
M. Blodgett's body was found in her bedroom by her own mother. A roll of duct tape was discovered under her bed by police.

Prints
on the tape led police to Daniel Bartelt,19, a friend and artistic 
collaborator of Blodgett's. Now he's charged with first degree homicide 
in the brutal killing.

The
night before the young actress had just wrapped up a performance of the
Fiddler on the Roof and attended a cast party on the Sunday evening 
from which she returned at around 1 a.m. on Monday morning.

Her mother told police that she 
remembers her daughter returning in the early hours and in the morning 
went into her room to return some laundry at 8 am.

When she returned home at around midday she checked on her daughter and found her dead.

Blodgett's father, Charles, describes his daughter as a 'spectacularly beautiful person, deep and soulful.'

Bartelt told officials that he heard of Blodgett's death through a friend. He also attended a vigil for the slain young actress at her parent's home.
