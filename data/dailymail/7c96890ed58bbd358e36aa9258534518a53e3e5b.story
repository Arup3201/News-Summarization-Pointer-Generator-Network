A judge has called the Crown Prosecution Service 'crackers' for pursuing a £7.49 criminal damage claim against a retired Army captain.

Timothy Hallam, 55, who is said to have sawn the top off a wooden fence post in a long-running dispute with neighbours Alan and Carol Smith in Thurgoland, near Barnsley, is due face trial next month.

But district judge John Foster said the decision to prosecute Mr Hallam was 'the height of nonsense' and questioned whether the CPS was in touch with what mattered to the public in a time of austerity.

District Judge John Foster, left, has described as 'the height of nonsense' a court case over a £7.49 fence post row between Alan and Carol Smith, pictured right, and their neighbour, retired Army captain Timothy Hallam 

Sitting at Barnsley Magistrates Court, the judge said: 'I cannot believe - even given the vagaries of the Crown Prosecution Service these days - that it wants to proceed with this case against a 55-year-old man of exemplary character.

'It is crackers. The CPS really needs to get some sense of what is important to the public.

'This is a dispute between neighbours. It was a fence post before he cut the top off it and it is still a fence post.

'The neighbour is £7.49 out of pocket. It is the height of nonsense.'

The Smiths are believed to have filmed Mr Hallam chopping the top off the fence post with their CCTV cameras.

Mr Hallam said the case arose from a long-running dispute with his 
neighbour over rights of access and encroachment. 

He said: 'This is a matter of 
principle which I will not give way to. If I lose the case it could 
undermine a seriously expensive civil action.

'Take my employment away as well as 
leave me with a criminal record but the principle is something I will 
live with long after all this is over and I want to be able to live 
comfortably with my conscience if I have nothing else in the world.'

Prosecutor Chantel Lowery-Green said 
it was impossible to prove whose land the fence post was on, and said it
was felt Mr Hallam had to be prosecuted because of a chance of further 
trouble.

She said the boundary dispute was due to be sorted out at county court.

'A way out of this would have been to offer Captain Hallam the chance to be bound over to keep the peace.

'I understand he will not accept a 
binding over because he says he was in his rights to cut the top off the
post. We will have to list it for trial.'

Brian
Bushell, for Mr Hallam, said he believed he was within his legal rights
to cut off the top of the post because it was on his land and he 
claimed it contravened planning regulations.

Now Barnsley Central MP Dan Jarvis has waded into the row, saying the CPS needed to clarify the issue to assure the public that the correct decision had been made to prosecute.

He said: 'Given the current pressures on the public purse and the comments made by the judge, it is right that questions are asked about the wisdom of pursuing a case of this nature which has presumably come at significant expense to the taxpayer.'

Mr Hallam was granted unconditional bail until the trial on September 12.

A CPS spokesman said following the judge’s comments they would reassess the case before proceeding with the prosecution.

He said: 'We are aware of concerns raised by district judge Foster. This is a matter which was charged by the police and we await a full file from them at which point the matter will be further reviewed.'
