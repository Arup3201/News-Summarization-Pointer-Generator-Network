A new report claims that actor Stephen Collins will not be prosecuted in molestation cases involving underage victims that are currently being looked into by the New York Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.

TMZ reports that they have spoken to law enforcement sources who say 'the cases will go nowhere.'

This, despite audio obtained by the site from 2012 that has the actor allegedly confessing to molesting underage girls.

Getting off: Stephen Collins (above) may not be charged for allegedly molesting three underage girls according to law enforcement sources

Recorded: The scandal first erupted when recording made by Collins' wife Faye Grant (above) allegedly had the actor admitting to molesting underage girls

The audio was taped by Collins' estranged wife, Faye Grant, during a therapy session and without his knowledge. 

The problem apparently is that since the three cases in question as decades old, prosecutors will be barred by the statute of limitations.

Speaking with US Weekly this Wednesday, the LAPD say they are still very much investigating whether or not Collins molested an underage female neighbor.

'Special Victims Bureau detectives are working with New York Police Department authorities on this case,' they told the magazine.

'There is no further information at this time. The investigation is active and ongoing.' 

Missing out: Collins was fired from the film Ted 2 and the ABC show Scandal after the news broke

Grant has also claimed her estranged husband molested a girl in California during the time he appear on the show 7th Heaven, sometime between 1996 and 2007, but it appears no victim has come forward. 

The case in New York may still have a shot however, as the victim came forward in 2012. 

That being said, the incident happened sometime in the 70s and TMZ is reporting 'law enforcement has all but given up on a viable case.'

The NYPD has yet to respond to requests for comment.

And while Collins has yet to be charged with any crimes, the allegations have had a major impact on his career, with the actor being dropped from the hit ABC show Scandal as well as the film Ted 2, which he was set to start filming just days after this story first broke.
