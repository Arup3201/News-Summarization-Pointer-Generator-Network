Behind closed drawers even the most metrosexual of men admit owning a pair of grotty undies. In fact, the average man holds onto his beloved smalls for a staggering seven years.

Furthermore, 22 per cent of men admit they don't change their underpants every day - and a further seven per cent confess they often wear the same pair for three days or more.

Men in Northern Ireland were found to be
 the worst culprits, with six per cent believing three days is an acceptable 
amount of time to go without changing underwear, closely followed by guys in 
London and Wales (both five per cent).

How long have you been wearing those, buddy? A new study reveals that 22 per cent of men don't change their pants every day, and a further 7 per cent confessed to keeping the same pair on for three days or more

But this has not gone unnoticed by the women in their lives, with over half (59 per cent) left so unimpressed with their partner's underwear care that they plan to treat the man in their lives to an underwear upgrade this Valentine's Day. 

During the rest of the year, a third of 
men still rely on someone else to stock their underwear drawer, with 36 per cent
 splashing out on new pants only once a year.

Unimpressed: Topping the list of popular styles are boxer shorts and Y-front briefs - much to the dismay of nine in 10 women who dread the thought of their man in them

Almost one in 10 men 
aged 25 to 34 still rely on their mothers to keep the underwear drawer fully 
stocked.

Male likes and dislikes when it comes to their undergarments was also tapped into, with 16 per cent admitting to being 
extremely particular about their particulars, with colour, brand and 
style all having to be 100 per cent to their liking.

Topping the list of popular styles 
are boxer shorts (51 per cent), followed by the classic Y-front (20 per cent), much to 
the dismay of nine in 10 women who dread the thought of their man 
in briefs.

Time for a change? 59 per cent of women were left unimpressed with their partner's underwear care, so much so that over half of women are planning to treat the men in their lives to an underwear upgrade this weekend

When
 asked about their partner, men across the nation concur that the 
preferred underwear on a lady is a matching black set (43 per cent), with a partiality for French knickers (24 per cent) and a push-up bra (19 per cent).

Women, however,
 are trading in their more minimal undergarments for full panties with 
added coverage (23 per cent) and boy shorts briefs (21 per cent) for that all-day 
comfort and support.

And when it comes to celebrities looking spectacular in their smalls, David Beckham topped the boy's list, receiving 36 per cent of the votes from both men and women, while Olympic diver Tom Daley came second.

Curvaceous Kelly Brook and her flirty 
feminine intimates are also making an impression, topping the list of female celebrities with 17 per cent of the votes, closely followed
 by the enviably toned Myleene Klass with 14 per cent.

A spokesperson for 
Littlewoods.com, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Over half of women 
are so fed up with their partner's underwear care, they've made it their
 responsibility to look after that department.'
