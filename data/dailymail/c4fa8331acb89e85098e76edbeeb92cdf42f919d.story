'Louis van Gaal is a tremendously talented coach, I have worked with him at Ajax and also for the Netherlands national team and I cannot wait to work with him at the biggest club in the world.'

Van Persie's apparent fitness will be a boost to Van Gaal who took the club's spending to almost £150m with the £6million loan signing of Falcao.

The Colombian striker will earn a staggering £280,000-a-week during his time in England after moving from Monaco.

He is expected to feature for his national side against Brazil in Miami on Friday night. 

The 28-year-old completed his move in the early hours of Tuesday and said: 'I am delighted to be joining Manchester United on loan this season.

'Manchester United is the biggest club in the world and is clearly determined to get back to the top.

'I am looking forward to working with Louis van Gaal and contributing to the team’s success at this very exciting period in the club’s history.'
