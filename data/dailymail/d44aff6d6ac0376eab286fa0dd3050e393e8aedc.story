Disturbing photographs have emerged of an abandoned sheep that was left immobilized by nearly 50lbs of matted, urine-soaked wool.

The ewe was found in Greenleaf, Idaho, earlier this month in a field where she had been left for more than five days without food or water.

Workers at the Canyon County Animal Shelter told KBOI-TV that it took three people almost an hour to 'to cut her free from her wool shackles.'

Distressed state: Disturbing photographs have emerged of an abandoned sheep that was left immobilized by nearly 50lbs of matted, urine-soaked wool 

Sad story: The ewe was found in Greenleaf, Idaho, earlier this month in a field where she had been left for more than five days without food or water

It was unclear how long the sheep's coat had been left unsheared.

She was also suffering from hunger and dehydration.

Now she's improving daily and will be looking for a new home when she's given the all-clear by vets. 

The sheep was found west of Boise, and her owner has not been identified.

They will likely be charged with animal neglect. 

Sheriff's Lt. William Adams says that sheep need regular shearing so they can move freely.

On the mend: Now the sheep, nicknamed Dolly, is improving daily and will be looking for a new home when she's given the all-clear by vets

He says it was obvious the ewe, since nicknamed Dolly, hadn't been properly cared for.

'Being a domestic sheep like that it needs to be regularly sheered so it can get the extra weight off it so it can move freely,' he added. 

'In this instance the sheep was not cared for and caused it to lose mobility.'
