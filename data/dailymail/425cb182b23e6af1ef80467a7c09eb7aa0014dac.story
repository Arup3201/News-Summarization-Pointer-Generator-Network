England exit Brazil with a solitary point and two goals to show for all the blood, sweat and millions of pounds spent on this World Cup adventure. It has been a sorry return. They finish anchored somewhat miserably to the bottom of Group D, but will be back in competitive action in the autumn for the Euro 2016 qualifiers. There are big decisions ahead for Roy Hodgson about the direction of this team and maybe even one or two glimmers of encouragement to be found, somewhere within his 'realm of despair'.

PHIL JONES: An athletic performance made Hodgson’s odd experiment with Milner at right back all the more puzzling. Thought it must be said that any full-back appears more solid with Milner ahead in midfield. Hodgson moved Milner to help Luke Shaw midway through the first-half. Jones is a talented player, has physical presence which is useful at set-pieces and still only 22. It is time for him to find a position. Right-back is certainly an option, where he gets up and down the wing, attacks well, but he needs to gain experience there. He can be reckless and his positional play sometimes lacking. He was almost caught out by a long ball on half-time. IN.

Staying put: Phil Jones has don enough to suggest he deserves to keep his place in the squad

CHRIS SMALLING: Made a terribly nervous start. His distribution was poor, especially on his left side, and he seemed a little at sea between Gary Cahill and Shaw. He settled down as it went on but plays with such a casual air that sloppiness spreads through the team, a dangerous prospect in the heart of defence. There were better signs later in the game, proof he is strong in the air, mobile and quick across the ground, be it to intercept or to recover. OUT.

LUKE SHAW: The
 only real signs of his youth are in a positional sense. Sometimes he 
was a little too eager to fly past his winger. He allowed situations to 
develop around him without organising team-mates around to provide 
cover, and the Costa Ricans were keen to come and play on his wing in 
the first half. These things he will learn. Otherwise he is a remarkable
 prospect, the sort which commands a £40m price-tag. He was fast and 
comfortable on the ball and keen and decisive in attack while strong in 
defensive duels as he proved in the final seconds. IN.

World Cup bow: Luke shaw started on the left for England in what he will hope will be the first of many appearances at the greatest show on earth

JACK WILSHERE: Plenty
 of questions still to be answered, starting with his physical 
condition. Can he stay injury-free? Is he fully fit? Has the zip that 
takes him past opponents gone for good? Will it return as his fitness 
improves? Has he enough in his game if it has gone? He can tackle but 
can he defend? It cannot be easy with the pressure, because he is 
perhaps the one England are most desperate to see develop. He punched in
 and out. He adds aggression, forward thrust and vision with 
quality on the ball to a midfield soon without Frank Lampard and 
possibly Steven Gerrard. But he limped off again. IN.

ADAM LALLANA:
 The man who was the find of the friendlies from November to June was 
suddenly dropped by Hodgson on the eve of the World Cup to accommodate 
Sterling. England injected extra pace and dare but lost their balance. 
Lallana provides control and intelligence when he plays well. When he 
first came in and flourished he seemed better with better players around
 him,  made for international football, like Nick Barmby. He is 
imaginative on the ball, the sort of thing required to unlock well 
organised defences, but he was subdued. Perhaps confidence 
has been knocked. Perhaps he needs more experience at the level. Perhaps
 he is one for some team shapes and not others, but he is worth 
persisting with. IN.

Agonisingly close: Adam Lallana hits a shot past Oscar Duarte

ROSS BARKLEY:
 Fresh and exciting, with wonderful footwork and the priceless ability 
to go past defenders. In the heat of a competitive fixture against Costa
 Rica – more competitive than might have been expected - and with the 
added responsibility of starting the game, his shortcomings were more 
clear than in the warm-up friendlies. As Hodgson pointed out after he 
dazzled against Ecuador, he took risks in dangerous areas and struggled 
at times to impose himself on the game. The manager may have called this
 one right. He was targeted with some rough stuff and was 
booked for a shirt pull. IN.

DANIEL STURRIDGE: Wasted
 good chances. Might have won the game but he is England’s most lethal 
finisher and most consistent goal threat. He is sharp in tight spaces 
and sees openings, if sometimes over-intricate and too ambitious. One of
 the fundamental decisions of the summer for Hodgson concerns Sturridge 
and Wayne Rooney. Does he devise a way to accommodate them both in 
attack – possibly two up front with Sterling in behind, three 
midfielders and the wingers sacrificed - or to choose one of them up 
front and not the other? IN.

The wrong side of the post: Daniel Sturridge squandered a fine chance to give England the lead against Costa Rica

RAHEEM STERLING:
 Amazing in training, sent-off in Miami, flickered against Italy, 
vanished against Uruguay and started on the bench against Costa Rica. 
When he came on, his first contribution was to put his head down and 
dribble the ball out of play. Then he surrendered possession and put his
 defence in trouble. It has been an adventure of highs and lows, but 
Sterling seems unfazed at the idea of providing England’s extra 
dimension. His pace is electric and he slices through a team in seconds.
 At this moment, he looks like the one to construct the next generation 
around. IN.

JOE HART: Done little wrong, yet barely made a save. Can be No1 for the next decade but would be nice if some pressure was applied. IN.

BEN FOSTER: Kept a goal well against Costa Rica and has proved an able deputy to Hart, though he can be erratic. IN.

Safe hands: Ben Foster holds on to a cross during a Costa Rica attack

FRASER FORSTER: Main contribution has been cameraman in the Gary Cahill’s video diaries as they tricked Joe Hart. OUT.

GLEN JOHNSON: Time to look for a better right-back. There are a few around. One must step forward to claim the place. OUT.

The end of an era: Glen Johnson (right) stretches with Liverpool team-mates Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling

LEIGHTON BAINES: Not enhanced case to be future left-back, but not well protected in his games. Much depends on Shaw’s progress. IN.

GARY CAHILL: He’s not JT but it’s time for him to become the leader of this defence, organise and impose authority. IN.

PHIL JAGIELKA: Brave and honest but limitations exposed at the very highest level. Strengthening in central defence is a priority. OUT.

Time to go: England should move on from Rickie Lambert (left) and Phil Jagielka (right)

STEVEN GERRARD: Time to go for his own sake, but no heir apparent in midfield is a big concern. Hodgson must delay his exit. IN.

FRANK LAMPARD: See Gerrard, but two years older. Played well and a fine example to young players but time to go. OUT.

Frustration: Jack Wilshere remonstrates with the referee after losing out on a decision

JAMES MILNER: Under-used as if Hodgson feared the “cautious” implications of his selection. His bite may solve central midfield issue. IN.

JORDAN HENDERSON: Impressive in the friendlies, anonymous when the bar was raised. His energy is vital but does not pass it well. IN.

ALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN: Ought to have gone home and replaced. Stuck around, got injured again. Key part of the future when fit. IN.

Much maligned: But James Milner impressed against Costa Rica and should be used for future tournaments.

DANIEL WELBECK: Sometimes looks the part, often doesn’t. More consistently may emerge if he finds regular club football. IN.

RICKIE LAMBERT: England’s future should not hinge on a decent 32-year-old journeyman, despite his continued rise. OUT.

WAYNE ROONEY: A World Cup goal at last. Perhaps the next captain, but role must be defined without hurting Sterling’s progress. IN.
