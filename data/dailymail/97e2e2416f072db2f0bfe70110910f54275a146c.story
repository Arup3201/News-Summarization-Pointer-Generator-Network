Jack Pack: Adam Chandler, Alfie Palmer, Andrew Bourn and Sean Ryder Wolf on Britain's Got Talent

Other members of the group include Alfie Palmer, Andrew Bourn and Sean Ryder Wolf.

Judge Simon Cowell praised the group's style after they came fourth in the live finals of the ITV show with their version of Frank Sinatra's That's Life.

Members of the group gave up their jobs to focus on their music career. 

The alleged victim is believed to be a former girlfriend according to The Mirror.

Diplock, who got to the X Factor finals in 2007 in a band called Futureproof, was interviewed by police.

Futureproof was formed from male singers who initially auditioned as soloists but did not make it past the bootcamp stage.

However, believing that talent had been lost, judge Louis Walsh decided to give them a lifeline and invited them back as a group.

The group went onto make it past bootcamp to the judge's houses where they were told by mentor Simon Cowell they had made it to the final 12. However, they were voted off on the third live show.

Last month it emerged the members of Jack Pack had all had successful careers in the showbiz industry. Collectively, the boy band have supported a vast array of pop stars including Sir Tom Jones, Westlife, Sugarbabes, Boys II Men and Blue.

Diplock is also a wedding singer while Andrew Bourn and Alfie Palmer are Michael Buble impersonators.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A 29-year-old man has been summonsed to appear before Maidstone magistrates on June 24 to face a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.'
