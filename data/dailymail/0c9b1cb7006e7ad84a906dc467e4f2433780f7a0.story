A video of an owl dancing in front of a mirror after it was successfully raised by a New Zealand charity is proving to be a hit online.

The video, featuring a New Zealand Morepork owl, shows the seemingly happy and healthy bird bobbing its head as it dances along to the music.

The Morepork arrived at the New Zealand Bird Rescue Charitable Trust's hospital in Auckland when it was a week old.

The Morepork was taken in by the centre when it was only a week old - it's now happy, healthy and dancing

The charming New Zealand native bird seems to enjoy watching itself dance and is fixated by its own reflectionÂ 

The trust said it was now healthy, flying and had lost most of its chick feathers.

'This little Morepork arrived at the centre as a tiny chick, it stayed in our care for quite a few months and has recently been soft released.'

It added the happy go-lucky dancing Morepork video was a great start to a rainy New Zealand winter morning.

The organisation acts as a shelter for birds which have often been subjected to cruel attacks and the effects of pollution.

It takes in orphaned, sick or injured birds, taking them to veterinarian care and looks after them until they are rehabilitated and ready to release back into the wild.

Moreporks are New Zealand's only remaining native owl not lost to extinction - they measure about 30cm in length and can turn their heads a whole 270 degrees.
