Child murderer Stuart Hazell is 'worse than Ian Huntley' because he killed a member of his own family, Tia Sharp's grandmother said today.

Christine Bicknell, 47 sobbed as she said she had loved the convicted drug dealer and had no idea she was living with a 'monster' for five years.

'People portray him as Ian Huntley. But no, he's worse than Ian Huntley. OK, he took two little girls that he knew but Stuart took his step grand daughter - that makes him worse,' she told ITV's This Morning.

Soham killer Huntley abducted best 
friends Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, and then killed them 
in his Cambridgeshire home a decade ago.

But Ms Bicknell says his crime, although disgusting, does not match Hazell's, adding: 'Tia loved him unconditionally and I thought he loved her unconditionally as well.

'He couldn't have loved me in the first place. He knew she was my life. She was my life. You don't take the love from someone you love surely?' she said.

Bereft: Tia Sharp's grandmother Christine Bicknell sobbed today as she described her relationship with her granddaughter's killer Stuart Hazell

For most of his life Stuart Hazell was a jobless petty criminal who solved his problems with alcohol and drugs.

But his partner Christine Bicknell stood by him as he committed serious 
offences and went to prison because 'I thought I knew the real Stuart'.

They
became a couple in 2007, four years after he had a two week affair with
Ms Bicknell's daughter Natalie Sharp, 31, who was Tia's mother.

This
relationship gave him access to Christine's five grandchildren, who he 
smoked marijuana in front of while drinking lager and vodka because her 
family trusted him '100 per cent'.

On her first impression of Stuart Hazell, Christine said, "I liked him. We chatted. We were friends... I worked in the pub he drank in. I knew he had previous but it didn't affect me. It wasn't part of my past, that was his past.'

Revealing why she fell in love with him, she said: 'He was a gentle giant - regardless of his reputation - ok, he'd get argumentative, but normal every day arguments, no violence, no abuse. He did lots around the house; he hoovered. The only thing he didn't do was iron.'

But Ms Bicknell's faith was never repaid as last August he murdered the 12-year-olf schoolgirl in the most depraved way, and the man she now says is 'rotten to the core' was jailed for 38 years without parole yesterday.

'I thought I knew the real Stuart,' she told the Daily Mirror, 'I thought I could see a loving, gentle caring man who’d gone astray but wanted to change his ways.

'I actually felt sorry for him because I thought his terrible childhood had scarred him and that was the reason he turned to crime, drinking and drugs.

'He told me he’d never had a normal home life – so I gave him that. He had a ready-made family…and a granddaughter he appeared to dote on.

'He used to talk to me about his childhood and cry like a baby. It would
usually happen when he’d done something wrong, and he wanted sympathy,'
she said.

'But now I know nothing would have changed that man – and he can’t blame his actions on what others did to him. He was rotten to the core.'

Hazell was taken into care at a young age after his father was sent to prison and earned his first conviction at the age of 14.

He told a psychologist his absent mother was a prostitute who locked him in the house without food and claimed he was raped aged 16 while staying at a homeless hostel in Soho. He spent his 20s in and out of court.

His first meeting with the Sharp family came some time in 2003 when he met Christine Bicknell while she worked as a barmaid at the Raynes Park Tavern. She introduced him to her daughter Natalie Sharp and they had a brief two-week-long relationship.

Then in April 2003 Hazell was jailed for 34 months for supplying cocaine.

After his release he renewed contact with Christine Bicknell and they started going out on April 23, 2007. A week later he moved in to her home at 20 The Lindens.

Under pressure from Christine Bicknell, Hazell managed to get a job as a window cleaner and helped look after the grandchildren while she was out at work at a care home.

In February 2010 he was convicted for possessing a machete and went to prison for a year, but his loyal partner stood by him after he told her 'You’re the most important thing in my life.'

Tia Sharp was said to 'idolise' the man she had known since the age of seven and became known as his 'clingon.'

But Hazell became sexually obsessed with the young girl and on three nights in July 2012 filmed her sleeping at his home. He also secretly filmed her rubbing cream on to her legs.

Detectives believe he deliberately removed the bathroom door at the house - supposedly to paint it - so he could spy on the schoolgirl. He is also thought to have modified the light socket in her room to create a 'spyhole'.

Hazell's obsession also led to him searching for indecent images of children who wore glasses like Tia.

It is thought vodka-fuelled Hazell attempted to sexually assault Tia in the early hours of the morning.

Tia, described by Christine Bicknell as 'not the sort of girl you could groom', must have fought back before being suffocated by Hazell using her own duvet.

Hazell then moved her dead body into the sexual pose graphically revealed to the jury at the Old Bailey during the trial. Her blood was also found on his belt and on a sex toy.

'The idea of that just makes me feel totally sick. I didn’t have a clue any of that was going on. He may have had it rough when he was young, but that can never be an excuse for killing Tia,' Ms Bicknell said.

'He murdered my granddaughter that night. That’s one fact he’ll never be able to worm his way out of.'
