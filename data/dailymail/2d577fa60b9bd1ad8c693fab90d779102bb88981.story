Malclom Turnbull was ranked 69th most trusted Australian - ten spots higher than Prime Minister Tony Abbott

Treasurer Joe Hockey was 77th on the list, which was compiled by surveying a representative sample of 1200 Australians.

Although Mr Abbott's trust ranking was not great, there was worse news for opposition leader Bill Shorten, who finished joint 81st with Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce.

It was another bad year for politicians generally, with the profession remaining rooted to the bottom of the trust rankings, along with salespeople, sex workers and call-centre staff.

Paramedics were the most trusted professionals for the 10th year in a row, followed by firefighters, rescue volunteers, nurses and doctors.

‘Politicians have never fared well in the trust stakes but, in recent times, it seems Australians have been particularly unimpressed,’ Reader's Digest said.
