Illegal HIV testing kits being sold online could give an incorrect diagnosis, a Government health watchdog warned today.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) plans to shut down six websites based in the UK which have sold kits imported from China without the necessary CE quality mark.

The websites also sold non-compliant testing devices for other sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis.

Wrong results: People who have purchased illegal HIV tests online in the UK have been contacted by the Health Protection Agency to say that they are inaccurate

Almost 500 people have already bought the kits, which allow users to test themselves for infection in their own homes.

People have been browsing the internet to buy the products as an anonymous alternative to being tested in a clinic.

Some of the kits came with no instructions at all, while others were confusing or insufficient.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has written to people who have purchased the kits, warning them that they do not comply with UK guidelines.

The list of people who had bought tests were contained in sales records uncovered during the MHRA investigation.

The agency regularly scans the internet to catch websites selling illegal devices.

More than 1,100 people would have to be 
offered HIV tests in the emergency room to find just one new infection 
with the potentially deadly virus, researchers from France said this week.

This means that while home tests for the disease are currently illegal, testing in busy hospitals is not the right solution either.

Their conclusion - that universal HIV screening in casualty is not a 
practical option - contradicts current recommendations from the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In the UK, people are urged to visit their most convenient GUM clinic or go to their local GP.

In order to comply with EU rules, kits must carry the CE kite mark and the name and address of the manufacturer or an EU-based representative.

It is illegal in the UK to sell any kits to test for HIV, but not for other sexually transmitted infections.

The HPA stressed that free and confidential tests are available on the NHS.

Susanne Ludgate, the MHRA's clinical director of services, said: 'As far as self-test kits for sexually transmitted infections are concerned, purchasers should check that any kits purchased from internet sites are CE marked, which should denote conformity with the relevant European legislation.

'We're concerned that there may be a number of self-test kits being sold online that may not be compliant with the relevant piece of legislation and we're urging people not to consider the internet as a method of anonymous testing.

'These kits may be unreliable and there is a significant risk they could be providing the user with a false result.'

Dr Fortune Ncube, from the HPA's blood-borne viruses department, said: 'If anybody feels they have put 
themselves at risk they should contact their local GP or go to their 
most convenient GUM clinic, where they can receive a full screen for all
STIs, including HIV.

'Rapid and confidential tests, as well as sexual health advice, are available through the NHS without charge.'
