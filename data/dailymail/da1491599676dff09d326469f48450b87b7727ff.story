Sacked Manchester United manager David Moyes is in the clear over an alleged bar-room assault, police said today.

The 51-year-old Scot was spoken to by police after claims made by builder Josh Gillibrand, 23, that he had been attacked at a wine bar in Clitheroe in May.

Officers were called to the Emporium bar in the Lancashire market town following a report of an altercation on the evening of May 21, just a month after Moyes had been sacked from the Premier League club.

Mr Moyes, who lives near Preston, had been socialising with his friend, Blackburn Rovers managing director Derek Shaw, a businessman who lives in the Ribble Valley, and others.

They had dinner in Piccolino's restaurant in Clitheroe before heading on to Emporium for a drink at around 10pm. 

Witnesses said that a group of drunken young men began shouting at Moyes shortly before he entered the bar, making comments about his managerial style.

One said: 'Moyes started to head in with his mates but he was being barracked by drinkers outside.

'He was getting a bit of lip from a couple of blokes and then one guy, who was a bit drunk, said something about him being s*** and having never won anything.'

A scuffle ensured, during which joiner Mr Gillibrand, from nearby Dutton, said he was grabbed by an angry Mr Moyes.

Mr Gillibrand said he suffered concussion and a bloodied nose in the fracas, which ended when a police car was flagged down and officers came and spoke to the men involved.

At the time, police said there were 'a number of differing accounts' of what happened, but today Lancashire Police confirmed no further action would be taken against any party.

A spokesman said: 'After careful consideration of all the circumstances in this case it has been decided that no further action will be taken against anyone.

'A thorough investigation has been carried out and everyone identified as having been involved in this incident or having witnessed it have provided accounts to the police.

'All these accounts were given voluntarily, it has not been necessary to arrest any person. These accounts have been considered and it has been decided that this is the most appropriate course of action.'

Moyes was dismissed by Manchester United last April following a mediocre season after he replaced the retiring Sir Alex Ferguson.  He had been in charge for less than a year and was said to have received a £4.5million pay off. 

He has formerly managed Everton and Preston North End, and played as a centre half for a number of clubs including Celtic.
