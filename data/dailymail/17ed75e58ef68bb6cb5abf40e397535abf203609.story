Everybody knows cats love to curl up in a ball, but Rigby the Bengal takes his love of curling into a ball to a new level with a little help from his owner.

In the 42-second video, which was posted to YouTube by Terry Goodship, the moggy can be seen curling himself up while his owner slides him across a smooth wooden floor.

The activity looks similar to the Canadian dominated winter sport Curling, however the addition of a cat instead of stones is a novel twist.

In position: The owner places Rigby the cat on his back as he gets ready to play the curling game

The cat slides at speed for about 15 feet before coming to a halt and sprinting back to his owner within seconds so that he can do it all over again. 

Rigby's owner laughs frequently as the cat returns and the process of curling and sliding on the floor happens again and again.

There are a total of six curling and sliding demonstrations by Rigby the cat and his owner during the short amusing video.

The video was posted with the line, 'our Bengal cat Rigby enjoying his favourite game'.

Go again: The cat seems to enjoy the activity and he runs back quickly to his owner for another attempt

Cat curling: The cat loves curling up in a ball and sliding across the floor so much he does it six times
