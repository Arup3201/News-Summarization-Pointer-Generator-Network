Two drivers in the notorious Cannonball Run have lost their licenses as French police clamp down on speeding and drink driving in the London to Paris race.

Police stopped the drivers north of French city of Rennes after they were clocked driving at speeds of up to 99mph on a four-lane highway with a 68mph speed limit.

Their licences were confiscated on just the second day of racing. Three other drivers were fined and another three were recorded as marginally exceeding the speed limit.

Police also conducted drink driving checks on their route in France after the competitors had crossed the Channel by ferry earlier today.

Fifty participants in crazy costumes and decked out super-motors took off yesterday for the annual Cannonball 2000, a 2,000 mile that takes drivers through five European cities.

The race began in Portsmouth and participants were hoping to reach Barcelona by late today.

A participant named David said: ‘We've had a briefing with the French police.

‘They told us the speed limit on the highway is 130 km/h (80mph) and we shan't go faster. 

‘That's what I'll do because I don't want to lose the car!’

Another participant called Robert, at the wheel of a black Ferrari, said: ‘It's going to be a very exciting day but we won't be in Barcelona before eight. 

‘We can't go faster than the speed limits.’

The driver of a Maserati was more daring, saying Barcelona would be feasible ‘at this rate at 8pm, if no police at 4 or 5 pm’.

The tour is named after the famous 1981 film Cannonball Run about a cross country race, starring Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore.

Drivers travel from London to Barcelona and make their way through Monte Carlo and Milan before crossing the finish line on Paris’ Champs Elysees on Sunday.

Long-distance race events, such as Cannonball, have received criticism after a driver in a rival event, Gumball 3000 Rally, was involved in a crash which killed an elderly Macedonian couple in 2007.

Wealthy businessman Nicholas Morley was spared jail for his involvement in the accident which saw his Porsche 911 crash into Vladimir Chepunjoski, 67, and his wife Margarita’s Volkswagen Golf near the Albanian border in May five years ago.

Based on the same principle as Cannonball 2000, each competitor pays £28,000 to enter Gumball 3000 which involves driving 3,000 miles from London to Athens and back, across Europe on public roads.

Mr Morley was given a two-year-suspended sentence but the case raised questions about the safety risks of asking participants to drive long distances, sometimes 720 miles, in one day.

Long journey: The race runs for 2000 miles through London to Barcelona and back via Milan, Monte Carlo and Paris

Cannonball 2000 Founder Gary Redman describes the cross-continent drive as a ‘pulsating five-day party with like minded people looking to enjoy some of the most amazing cities in the world'.

The event sponsors children’s charity Dreams come True and donates a percentage of their proceeds to the charity which helps fulfill the wishes of terminally ill children.

Well known participants included ex-boxer Ricky Hatton, Coronation Street actor Ryan Thomas and Emmerdale star Kevin Fletcher.

The trio looked very pleased with themselves surrounded by glammed-up girls ahead of the race.
