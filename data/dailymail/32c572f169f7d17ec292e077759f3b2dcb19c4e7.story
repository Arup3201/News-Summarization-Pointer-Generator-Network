Today is winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and to celebrate  thousands of pagans packed the ancient site of Stonehenge.

Around 1,500 people gathered at the ancient monument in Wiltshire to watch the sunrise this morning.

Winter solstice is an astronomical phenomena which marks the shortest day and longest night of the year.

This is caused by the tilt of the Earth’s axis, when the North Pole is tilted furthest from the Sun.

Senior druid King Arthur Pendragon reigned over the event and told the international crowd the event celebrates hope.

Officially, Sunday was the shortest day, but the crowds gathered to celebrate this morning's sunrise as the moment the North Pole is tilted furthest from the Sun.

The crowd's spirits remained undampened despite the fact heavy cloud blocked out most of the view.

Senior druid King Arthur Pendragon told the BBC: 'What we're really here for is to celebrate the fact that the cycle of the world turns, and from now on the days get longer and it's the return of the sun.

'It's a time of change and hope is renewed - the same message really from a pagan perspective as from a Christian perspective.

'That's what this season is all about - a message of hope.'

Arthur Pendragon, real name John Timothy Rothwell, believes he is the reincarnation of the 5th century King Arthur. 

Last week English Heritage - which manages the stones near Salisbury in Wiltshire - reported a record number of tourists in the past year.

Two weeks ago the Government announced in its Autumn Statement that it will be investing in a new 2.9km tunnel to remove the A303 from the Stonehenge landscape.

English Heritage and National Trust as guardians of Stonehenge and its World Heritage Site, see this announcement as a 'truly momentous decision' in the modern history of one of the most famous places in the world.

English Heritage recently announced 1.3 million people had visited the site since the opening of the £27 million visitor centre in December last year - a nine per cent increase on the previous 12 months.

Many different cultures hold holidays, festivals, gatherings rituals on the day of the winter solstice  to celebrate the shortest day of the year

Many cultures hold holidays, festivals, gatherings rituals and other celebrations during winter solstice.

According to the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, the name for winter solstice in Druidry is Alban Arthan, which means 'The Light of Arthur'.  

On their website they say of the winter solstice: 'At this point the Sun is at its southernmost point almost disappearing beyond the horizon, and the days are at their shortest. 

'This was a time of dread for the ancient peoples as they saw the days getting shorter and shorter.

'A great ritual was needed to revert the course of the sun. This was probably calculated by the great circles of stone and burial grounds which are aligned to this festival.

'Sure enough, the next day the Sun began to move higher into the sky, showing that it had been reborn.' 

Stonehenge is one of the most famous historic sites in the world.

It is made up of the remains of a prehistoric ring of standing stones in the middle of a dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze age monuments, including burial mounds.

Archaeologists believe it was built sometime between 3,000 BC and 2,000 BC.

Stonehenge was a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 and is legally protected as a scheduled ancient monument.

It is managed by English Heritage and the surrounding last is owned by the National Trust.
