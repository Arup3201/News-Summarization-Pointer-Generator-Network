North Korea has banned workers from being paid bonuses in Choco Pies after their popularity sparked a black market trade in the chocolate biscuits, it has been reported.

North Korean employees of South Korean companies at the joint Kaesong Industrial Complex, in North Korea, were used to receiving the marshmallow and chocolate treats, similar to Wagon Wheels, as a form of payment.

But they have now been told they will receive foods such as sausages, instant noodles, powdered coffee and chocolate instead.

North Korea has banned workers from being paid Choco Pies as bonuses

North Korean officials told employers to stop handing the biscuits out last month, the Seoul-based newspaper Chosun Ilbo has reported.

The biscuits became popular among North Korean workers after South Korean companies were banned from paying them bonuses in money and so opted to give them the treats instead.

The chocolate biscuits would however be taken back to Pyongyang and sold for substantial amounts on the black market.

Last year it was reported that when Pyongyang closed the Kaesong Industrial Complex, amid heightened tensions in the region, black market values of the biscuits soared, with some changing hands for up to Â£14.

In North Korea, the black market for capitalist products is highly illegal, but thriving.

It is believed the North was first introduced to the confectionery via the Kaesong Industrial Complex - where 100 South Korean factory owners employ about 50,000 North Korean labourers

North Korea suffered a crippling famine in the 1990s that killed an estimated one million people, and it has struggled with food production since.

Previously, food such as pizzas, hamburgers and french fries were banned from the North.

Choco-Pies have even been sent to North Korea in balloons by advocacy groups.
