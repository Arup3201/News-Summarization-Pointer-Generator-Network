Stephen Colbert dedicated the entire first segment of his show on Monday to address the controversy over a satirical tweet taken out of context.

Last Wednesday, the comedian made a joke during his show about how Dan Snyder, the head of the Washington Redskins' football team, has set up a charity in an effort to help diffuse the ongoing tensions over the team's widely-criticized name.

In that vein, the Comedy Central host likened Snyder's move to Colbert's hypothetical decision to create the 'Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever'.

Explaining himself: In addition to an apocalyptic opening 'nightmare' sequence and a brief foray into news, Colbert directly addressed the #CancelColbert issue on Monday's show

Offensive: The official Twitter account for The Colbert Report posted this yesterday

During Monday's show, Colbert explained that the firestorm started after one of the show's Twitter accounts posted a tweet about the joke without referencing the larger context or providing a link to the entire bit.

'Who would have thought a means of communication limited to 140 characters would ever cause misunderstanding,' he said.

The @ColbertReport tweet in question prompted people to launch a 'CancelColbert' hashtag calling for the show to be dropped.  

'The Cancel Colbert people think that even in context, I am racist. I just want to say I am not a racist. I don't even see race, not even my own. People tell me I'm white and I believe them because I just spent six minutes explaining how I am not a racist- and that is about the whitest thing you could do,' he said on Monday.

Facing the tweets: Colbert admitted that the tweet, which was posted by someone at his network, did not provide any context for the satire

Apology: The account was forced to post an apology and a disclaimer to say the tweet had nothing to do with Stephen Colbert

I share your rage: Stephen Colbert's official Twitter account distanced itself from the offending tweet

Colbert pointed to the tweet- as opposed to the four reruns of the show and a Facebook post on the show's official page- as the source of the outrage which he argued was a result of the lack of context.

He joked that the @ColbertReport tweet was the point when 'the twit hit the fan'.

Supporters- and Colbert himself- derided the controversy for missing the point of his original criticism: that the Redskins owner's charity 'which some have called an obvious attempt to win over Native Americans because it only uses the word Redskins once'.

Colbert went on to point out that Twitter seems to be fine with (Snyder's charity) because I haven't seen s*** about that'.

The hashtag was reportedly started by a 'Twitter hashtag activist- or "hashtivist"' who identifies herself as Suey Park. Though she has been criticized online since the launch of #CancelColbert, the host urged his supporters not to berate her.

He did not mention her by name, but alluded to a woman 'who has been viciously attacked on Twitter and if anyone's doing that for me, I want you to stop right now. She's just speaking her mind, and that's what Twitter's for, as well as ruining the ending of every show I haven't seen yet'.

Biz Stone, one of the founders of Twitter helped him 'kill' the @ColbertReport handle before directing followers to turn to his personal account, @StephenAtHome for any future tweets. The @ColbertReport handle has since been discontinued.
