A haunted ruin where the ghost of King Charles I's executioner is said to roam at night is going under the hammer for £75,000.

Almost 250 years old the Grade II listed building has been described by estate agents as a folly - a building in the form of a castle or temple originally constructed to satisfy a fancy or conceit.

The ruins, in the village of Dinton, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire are rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of John Mayne.

The ruins, in the village of Dinton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire are rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of John Mayne

Mayne, who was also known as the Dinton Hermit, used to live in a nearby cave in the 17th Century.

He was once secretary to Oliver Cromwell and local legend has it that he executed Charles I on January 30, 1649.

Mayne fell out of favour with Charles II during the restoration and was stripped of his wealth.

His ghost is now said to shelter within the crumbling walls of the octagonal folly constructed on a Saxon burial ground.

The octagonal folly was built on a Saxon burial ground by Sir John Vanhatten in 1769 to store his collection of fossils

Originally the folly was three storeys high with a newel staircase in the east tower, a fireplace on each floor in the west tower and was used by servants

Much interest has already been shown in the ruins, which are due to be auctioned by Michael Anthony estate agents next month

The folly was built in 1769 by the former owner of Dinton Hall, Sir John Vanhattem.

He used it to store his collection of fossils unearthed in the local chalk quarry and some are incorporated in the limestone walls.

Originally the folly was three storeys high with a newel staircase in the east tower, a fireplace on each floor in the west tower and was used by Sir John's servants.

Michael Anthony estate agents who is auctioning the property say they have already received significant interest in it.

The sale of the folly will be held by public auction at 1pm on November 26 at the Holiday Inn, New Road, Aylesbury

Michael Donnachie, a director at the firm, said that one pre-action offer had been received by a prospective buyer who envisaged a 'Grand Design' type of project.

Mr Donnachie said: 'It would be very nice to see it renovated.

'This would have to be done in consultation with English Heritage and the local council.

'It stands in about two thirds of an acre so well worth developing.'

The sale will be held by public auction at 1pm on November 26 at the Holiday Inn, New Road, Aylesbury.
