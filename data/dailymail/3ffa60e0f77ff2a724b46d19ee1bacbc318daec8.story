Gone: Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building last Wednesday after school  

Dozens of relatives, friends and supporters came together Monday in Crystal, Minnesota, to plead for the safe return of a 10-year-old who vanished without a trace five days earlier.

Barway Edwin Collins was last seen walking away from his apartment building in the 5400 block of Douglas Drive in Crystal after school Wednesday.

Over the past five days, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies have been searching the area for Barway with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses.

While police have not classified Barway's disappearance as an abduction at this point, on Monday they released a photo of two people who may be linked to the missing person case.

According to the Crystal Police Department, the man and woman pictured in a screen shot from a CCTV camera installed at the front entrance of the Cedarwood apartment complex may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school.

So far, the mystery couple have not been named as suspects or even persons of interest in the case.

Police Chief Stephanie Revering said during a press conference Monday that an Amber Alert has not been issued for Barway because investigators believe he may be with a relative.

While law enforcement officials continued searching for the missing fourth-grader, members of Crystal's Liberian community were busy handing out fliers featuring Barway’s picture to help bring him home.

At around 5pm Monday, more than 100 people gathered outside Cedarwood apartments for an emotional prayer vigil.

‘We miss Barway,’ his father, Pierre Collins, told the crowd. ‘Barway has been gone for a very long time now. We are begging and asking everyone to look out there.’

Chief Revering also attended the gathering, promising Barway's family to continue looking for him until he is found, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune. 

Barway was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm.

Mr Collins and his wife, Yamah, said the entrance surveillance camera caught their son opening the front door to the building, looking inside and then closing it, as if someone called him outside.

‘Please just bring him back. We just want Barway back. We don't want anything from them. Just let him go. Just let him come home,’ the parents begged, according to KARE11.

Collins is described as 5 feet tall, weighing 80lbs with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white T-shirt, black pants, red shoes and carrying a red school backpack.

Anyone with information on Barway Collins’ whereabouts is being asked to call police.
