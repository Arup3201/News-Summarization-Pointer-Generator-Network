Model Patricia Velasquez - widely touted as the world's first Latina supermodel - is set to release a memoir in which she comes out as a lesbian, and confirms decades-long rumors that she once dated comedian Sandra Bernhard.

Ms Velasquez, 44, who was born in Venezuela but has been based between New York and Los Angeles throughout most of her glittering modeling career, has kept her 'torturous' secret hidden until now.

In her book, Straight Walk, the mother-of-one says she realized she was gay in the 90s - at a time when she was modeling for Victoria's Secret, Sports Illustrated, Chanel and Gucci, among others - only after meeting Ms Berhard, now 59.

According to The New York Post, which reviewed the memoir, Ms Velasquez had 'never kissed a girl' before she met Ms Bernhard backstage at a fashion show in Paris.

Ms Bernhard - who is openly bisexual and rumored to have once enjoyed a fling with Madonna - invited Ms Velasquez back to her hotel, where they 'hooked up'.

'I was in deeply in love with Sandra in a way I'd never experienced before', the South American beauty writes in her book.

Ms Velasquez dated Ms Bernhard for a while and says she 'cried for two years' when the relationship ended, though doesn't go into any more detail about their time together.

She says that keeping her sexuality a secret for all those years was 'torturous'.

Speaking to Yahoo Parenting, the stunning model says she then dated a woman called Lauren for eight years, who gave birth to their child Maya, now eight.

The pair are still on good terms, and Ms Velasquez has been with her current partner Ileanna for a year.

'It’s very difficult to face your past, so I put off doing anything like this for a long time', she tells the website.

'But as my daughter started growing up and I was teaching her to be honest and proud, I knew it was time for me to set an example - and that meant facing my truth.' 

Ms Velazquez also says she felt compelled to come out because of anti-gay prejudice in the Latin community.

Hard start: Ms Velazquez, pictured (left) in 1994 and (right) in 2005, was born into a life of poverty but worked her way to supermodel stardom, at one point prostituting herself in Venezuala to pay for breast implants

Ms Velazquez was born into a life of poverty, one of six siblings, and with no running water. Her mother is a member of the Indigenous Wayúu people and her father is Mestizo.

Coming soon: Straight Walk - A Supermodel’s Journey to Finding her Truth - is out on February 10

She was discovered as a teen by a local hairdresser who persuaded her to compete in the 1989 Miss Venezuela beauty pageant.

In order to stand a fighting chance, Ms Velaquez says she 'prostituted' herself to an older man in exchange for breast implants. 

She also starved herself on a diet of chicken and tomato juice.

Her plan worked and she came second in the pageant before travelling around the fashion capitals of the world as her modeling career catapulted her to fame.

As well as appearing in several Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Editions, on the cover of Vogue, and scoring campaigns for Cover Girl and Pantene, Ms Velazquez became an actress too.

She is best known for her role as Anck-Su-Namun in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, but has also made minor appearances in Arrested Development and the L Word.

These days, Ms Velazquez juggles motherhood with several business interests, including her own line of skincare products, Taya Beauty.

She is also the founder of the Wayúu Taya Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to helping Latin American indigenous groups.

Straight Walk: A Supermodel’s Journey to Finding her Truth is out on February 10.
