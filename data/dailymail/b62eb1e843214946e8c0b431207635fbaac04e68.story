Malaysian police refuse to rule out foul play in the case of missing British backpacker as his family anxiously await results from an autopsy that will determine whether the body recovered from a jungle pond is him.

The body was found Wednesday lunchtime near a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where the 34-year-old had been working and seven days after he has last been seen.

Mr Huntley's mother Janet Southwell, who arrived in Malaysia on Monday was pictured this morning outside the Forensic Unit at the Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital in Kuantan with Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga.

While a formal identification has yet to be made, police said there was little doubt that the body was that of Mr Huntley (right) for no other Caucasian males had been reported missing on the island or in fact throughout the entire country

'The cause of death is still undetermined, hence this case is still classified as sudden death at this stage, although we can’t rule out any possibilities of foul play,' Sharifuddin Ab Ghani, Pahang state police chief told The Telegraph.

While a formal identification has yet to be made, police said there was little doubt that the body was that of Mr Huntley, for no other Caucasian males had been reported missing on the island or in fact throughout the entire country.

Mr Huntley, of Hackney in east London, has not been seen since going trekking on Tioman Island last Tuesday.

A
 search party consisting of commandos, police and firefighters stumbled 
across the body when they were returning to the base camp at around 12pm
 local time yesterday, The Star reported.

Hunt: Rescuers have been scouring the area in the hope of finding Mr Huntley for days

It was found early this morning near a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where the 34-year-old had been working, according to local reports

The body was found behind a row of cabins which were occupied by rescue operators over the last three days

Last night police were investigating 
two possibilities surrounding the tragic discovery - the death was 
either accidental or Mr Huntley had met with foul play.

Ms
 Southwell who had travelled with her husband to Tioman island, off the 
south-eastern coast of Malaysia, broke down in tears and ran to her 
cabin a short distance away when news of the body’s discovery was broken
 to her by Deputy Police Superintendent Johari Yahaya.

Earlier
 she had told of how she was staying positive in the hope that she would
 be the ‘friendly face’ her son needed when he came out of the jungle.

In Malaysia the international pressure from Mr Huntley's family and friends, who had feared there was a lack of action in spite of the public response, has turned into efforts on the ground

His mother, Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday after Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak about the search effort

Gareth Huntley and his girlfriend Kit Natariga. She said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions

Search
 teams, made up of commandos, police and Fire and Rescue Department 
specialists accompanied by sniffer dogs had spent days searching the 
jungle for the missing Englishman.

Earlier
 yesterday their hopes of finding him had lifted when they announced 
they had discovered ‘a trail’ - broken twigs and footprints - near the 
waterfall that Mr Huntley had spoken of trekking to.

But
 the hunt took a dramatic turn at lunch time yesterday when a search 
team returned to the conservation headquarters where they had spent the 
past three nights.

For 
they unexpectedly saw the badly decomposed body floating face up in the 
Mentawak River. Dressed in a T-shirt, shorts and shoes, it was just 
behind a row of cabins being occupied by the rescue teams.

The
 Juara Turtle Camp has now been closed off by police and particular 
attention is being paid to a kayak storage unit, which has been 
encircled with yellow tape warning people not to enter.

Questions
 police are anxious to find answers to, according to senior officers, 
surround the movements of Mr Huntley immediately after he announced to 
others at the centre that he was setting off on the jungle trek to the 
waterfall.

With his body
 being found within the confines of the conservation headquarters, 
police are questioning whether he even managed to reach the start of the
 jungle path before tragedy struck in some way.

Police
 investigations are also looking at the possibility that Mr Huntley did 
reach the waterfall and plunged into the river on his return.

A
 further line of inquiry will be whether he went into the water further 
upstream and his body was then carried to where it was found.

Earlier this week Malaysian authorities insisted they were committed to finding the Briton who went missing on the popular resort island seven days ago, with an army helicopter sent to aid the search

Only ten hours ago a Facebook page set up to find Mr Huntley posted this message

A Facebook group was set up to raise awareness about Mr Huntley's disappearance.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Malaysian police have confirmed that a body has been found on Tioman island in Malaysia.

'Foreign
 Office consular staff on the ground are continuing to work closely with
 the Malaysian authorities and are investigating with them as a matter 
of urgency.

'We continue to provide support to the family of Gareth Huntley at this very difficult time.'

Tuesday May 27: Gareth Huntley, 34, from London, goes on a trek to visit a waterfall in Tioman Island, off the south eastern coast of Malaysia's mainland.

He leaves in the morning and tells friends at the headquarters of a nearby charity project where he is volunteering that he will return by 2pm the same day. He fails to come back so a group goes out to search for him, checking various routes to the waterfall which is 6km away. Wednesday May 28: A further search also proves fruitless. According to fellow volunteer Charles Fisher the police are contacted in the afternoon.

He says: 'They sent a couple of members of the police force along to have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of assessing the situation.' Thursday May 29: A group of volunteers embark on another search, while a group from the local community also look for Mr Huntley deep into the jungle.

The police are 'no longer physically looking', Mr Fisher says. 'I think they were arranging for a search party but nothing happened.' Friday May 30: Janet Southwell, Mr Huntley's mother, calls on the authorities to do more to search for him.

She says: 'He has been missing for four days now, and as yet I have had no contact from any official agency advising me as to the progress of the search.' Saturday May 31: A friend of Mr Huntley, Kyle Neo Kai Fu, who lives locally, says: 'The idea that there is a proper professional search going on is laughable. There are five police, in one boat, and nobody is in control.

'The most likely scenario is that Gareth is injured in a ravine, with a broken leg - and we are running out of time.'

Ms Southwell makes a direct plea to Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to 'make one phone call to help my missing son'. Sunday June 1: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who is in Malaysia, speaks to the country's defence minister. He is assured that the authorities will do all they can to find Mr Huntley and they have already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter.

Mr Huntley's girlfriend, Kit Natariga, arrives on the island and warns that 'time is running out and we need action as soon as possible'. Monday June 2: Mr Huntley's mother also arrives on the island to support the search effort. She says she wants to see the area for herself and 'get a feel for where he's lost'.

His brother, Mark, says there are 103 people searching, alongside several helicopters and speedboats.

David Cameron speaks to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak to thank him for the extensive efforts of the search teams.

Wednesday June 4: Police searching for Mr Huntley find a body.

According to local reports the body, which is not confirmed as the missing Briton, is found in a pond a few yards from a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where Mr Huntley had been working.
