George Osborne is on course to break his promise to cut borrowing as new figures show the deficit rose by £1.6 billion in September.

Since April the Chancellor has borrowed more each month than the same time last year, with income and wealth taxes down.

The Treasury had been expected to cut borrowing by 12 per cent in 2014-15, but experts said it was 'ever more unlikely' to meet to target.

New figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show borrowing has been higher each month since April than the same time last year

New data from the Office for National Statistics borrowing in September, excluding the effects of bank bail-outs, was £11.8 billion, £1.6 billion ahead of the same month in 2013.

It means that halfway through the financial year, the Treasury looks well behind the target for a 12 per cent fall in the annual deficit expected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

Total borrowing for April to September stands at £58 billion, 10 per cent higher than for the same period in 2013-14.

Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The Government's current fiscal problems largely reflect the fact that much weaker-than-expected earnings growth has limited income tax receipts, along with a large number of people now being in low-paid jobs or self-employed.

The figures are a blow for Chancellor George Osborne who hopes to go into the next election claiming borrowing is down

'The Chancellor is looking ever more unlikely to meet his fiscal targets for 2014-15.'

Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: 'These figures are a serious blow to George Osborne.

'Not only is he set to break his promise to balance the books by next year, but borrowing in the first half of this year is now 10 per cent higher than the same period last year.

'As the OBR said last week, stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs are leading to more borrowing.'

Taxes on income and wealth for September of £13.1 billion were flat on the same month last year and just 0.6 per cent ahead for the year to date.

Within this, revenues from income tax and capital gains tax rose 2.2 per cent for the month and 0.1 per cent for the year to date.

OBR chairman Robert Chote has warned that the squeeze on pay growth is hitting the Government's revenues from income tax despite record numbers in work.

Annual pay growth has been lagging behind inflation since 2008 and latest official figures showed it was just 0.7 per cent.

Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said: 'The continued run of poor UK public borrowing figures looks set to severely hamper the Chancellor's ability to announce giveaways to address his party's deficit in the national opinion polls before next year's general election.'

The ONS figures suggested that the buoyant property market was continuing to have a positive effect on public finances.

Stamp duty on land and property continued to boost the Government's coffers, rising to £1.1 billion for September, matching a high in July that was a seven-year record.

Revenues from this were up £1.5 billion, or 34 per cent, to £5.9 billion for the April to September period.

The Treasury hoped to cut borrowing to £86.6billion in 2014-15, something which now looks increasingly unlikely

Total receipts were 3.1 per cent ahead to £46 billion, though for the year to date they are 0.4 per cent behind at £287.1 billion.

Spending for September rose by 3.7 per cent from £51.1 billion to £53 billion.

Underlying public sector debt was £1.451 trillion, or 79.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to 79.2 per cent last month and 77.9 per cent in September last year.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'We have seen stronger growth in receipts this month, but as today's figures show, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances.

'At the same time, we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy.'

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It's time for George Osborne to admit he got his strategy wrong. Today's figures show the deficit getting bigger as tax revenues dry up.

'The 90,000 people who marched through the streets of London on Saturday calling for a pay rise understand that it's not just British workers who need wages to go up, but that's what the Treasury and the economy needs too.

'Only a wages-led recovery can bring about the boost in demand that businesses need and the boost in revenue that the Government needs to cut the deficit and invest for the future.'
