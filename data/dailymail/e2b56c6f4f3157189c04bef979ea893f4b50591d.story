Man's best friend is the mailman's worst nightmare.

The United States Postal Service has halted mail delivery to dozens of homes in a Cedar Rapids, Iowa neighborhood because a small, unleashed Chihuahua mix has been terrorizing their local mailman.

'The dog has interfered, on a number of 
occasions with the delivery of the mail in that particular 
neighborhood,' USPS spokesman Richard Watkins told KCRG.

The owner of the small Chihuahua mix holds the troublesome dog while talking to a local TV reporter. 'It's a nice dog,' he said.

'Once we know that 
the dog owner has taken responsibility and making sure that dog is not 
running free in the neighborhood, the mail delivery will continue,' he added.

The canine's owner, Guillermo Tellez, contends its friendly.

'Itâ€™s a nice dog,' he said.

But, some others side with the postal service's characterization of the pooch.

Alyssa Taylor, who lives next door, said her family has been attacked by the dog.

'We
 got chased a couple times just bringing in our groceries into our house
 in our own driveway,' Taylor said. 'We called animal control at that 
point and they did come and seize the dogs because it did not have its 
vaccines up to date.'

Owner Guillermo Tellez says his Chihuahua mix is friendly, 'a nice dog.' But others, including his next door neighbor disagree

'Two weeks later my five-year-old was bit in the back of the leg in our own backyard,' she added

City officials said animal control workers visited the home twice last summer, including once when a dog was bit by the child.

An officer spoke to the family this week
 and police said the owner will be cited if the dog is spotted running 
around the neighborhood.

For now, neighbors have to visit a nearby post office to get their mail and some are urging for mail delivery to resume.

'I don't really care what they do,' said neighbor Elmer Kasey. 'I just want my mail back.'

Residents received letters last week 
from the USPS announcing it would suspend service in the neighborhood 
until the dog is restrained.

The notices were sent after the mailman saw the Chihuahua mix off its leash for the fifth time. The USPS says 5,879 postal employees across the country were attacked by dogs during 2012.

Next door neighbor Alyssa Taylor says she and her young children have been attacked by the small dog on multiple occasions. Another neighbor Elmer Kasey says all he wants is for his mail delivery to resume

This letter was sent to residents telling them that mail service was suspended and that they can pick up their mail a local post office until the dog is leashed
