Having slogged his way around the lower leagues for 25 years, Sean Dyche has suddenly become popular and fashionable after taking Burnley into the promised land of the Premier League.

He has been granted the flattering nickname ‘Ginger Mourinho’, while agents have been bombarding him all summer with phone calls, faxes and emails because he has money to burn. Or at least that’s what they think.

The reality is a little different as Dyche is keen to point out in a typically forthright way.

Ginger Mourinho: Burnley manager Sean Dyche is determined to succeed in the Premier League

On the up: Dyche led Burnley to promotion to the Premier League against all the odds last season

‘One agent sent a message to tell me his player was available at €15million and wanted £45,000-a-week salary, net,’ he says. ‘My reply was two words: “Wrong club.”

‘I was thinking, at least do your homework. It’s not going to happen at that level at Burnley. I’m not stupid and I know we’ve got to be competitive but would I do that and rip the heart out of the club? No, it’s not my style.’

It’s neat symmetry that 24 hours after Premier League superstars like Sergio Aguero and Mesut Ozil do battle in tonight’s World Cup Final, Dyche will take his assortment of youngsters, journeymen and cut-price signings to Austria for a pre-season training camp he hopes will get them ready for the toughest challenge of their lives.

Whereas Arsenal bought Alexis Sanchez for £35m this week, Dyche’s five summer signings so far have cost £2m: Michael Kightly (£1.5m), Marvin Sordell (£500,000) and freebies Matt Taylor, Matt Gilks and Steven Reid.

Survival looks impossible until you start listening to Dyche. Firstly, he tells you Burnley were sixth-favourites to be relegated from The Championship last season and had only 18 outfield players to choose from. They won automatic promotion.

Secondly, Tony Pulis and Crystal Palace showed that, with the right attitude and spirit, anything is possible. Palace were written off like Burnley and finished 11th in last season’s Premier League.

Most importantly, Dyche won’t allow his squad - whose crown jewels are England under-21 striker Danny Ings and £5million-rated defender Kieran Trippier - to feel any fear.

‘We are leaving Burnley-world and going into the reality of Premier League-world but it’s not scary,’ he insists.

‘I know if you catch some of those top boys like Aguero and Sanchez when they are on a hot day, you can get badly hurt. But without being disrespectful, they are still human. They have ups and downs, no player no matter how valuable can be a magician every single week.

‘We are built on a real group mentality rather than individuals. If we bought one big star you’d get this weird thing in the camp. You’d have baggage of all the players who have done well for you whose contracts are nowhere near that of the signing you’ve just made.

‘It would hurt us so, if my chairman came to me and said “Look, we will buy that £20m player”, I would say I don’t think it is appropriate for this club at this time. It would harm the group and unquestionably we have talent here already.’

Burnley have been here before of course. They were in the Premier League in 2009/10 and famously beat Manchester United at Turf Moor early in the season. But manager Owen Coyle jumped ship for Bolton midway through the campaign and they were relegated.

Now given a second chance, Burnley could make as much as £120m from promotion. Dyche is adamant it won’t be frittered away, and knows all about getting value for money after a 17-year playing career in the lower echelons with Chesterfield, Bristol City, Luton, Millwall, Watford and Northampton, and a short managerial stint at Watford.

‘One of the first things we did at Burnley this summer was to get the diggers in to lay new fibre sand-based training pitches. The weather up here means we need them, trust me.

‘They turn a tap on at the end of October and don’t turn it off again until the end of March. Our pitches down the bottom end of the training ground got waterlogged last season and were unusable. It’s a miracle my hair is still ginger.’

Ah, the hair. Dyche’s short, red hair and beard, coupled with a voice that is a permanent rasp, mean he is set to be one of the cult figures in the new Premier League season.

Under-stated: Dyche will not get carried away by Burnley's success last season and will look to progress

Even friends like Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who worked with Dyche at Watford, now refers to him as the ‘Ginger Mourinho’. Dyche will meet the real one when Burnley face Chelsea on the opening weekend of the season.

‘It’s just banter, isn’t it?’ smiles Dyche. ‘My mates give me some stick about the name but it’s just a bit of fun. If I do half as well as him I’ll be all right.

‘What I will say is that we are very aligned with the culture and environment we have built for the players and I don’t think that can change in any successful organisation.’

Two days in Austria have been set aside from regular football practise. One will deal with physical endurance, the other mental toughness.

Last summer, the players were driven to the point of exhaustion pushing giant tyres at an army boot camp. When they were on their knees, Dyche ordered them to sprint for 60 seconds.

‘We knew we had a small group and challenges would come our way where they would be tested to the limit but we had the experience of pre-season to fall back on,’ he explains.

‘The base requirement for a footballer is that you have to be physically and mentally strong, never more so than in the Premier League where you are under constant scrutiny.

‘But out of six weeks’ pre-season, it’s only two days. The rest of the time it’s football, football, football.

‘People have pre-conceptions about me because of my appearance, they think I must shout and bawl at my players, but that is so far from the reality.

‘I like to give the players lots of information about what we do. That’s the way I wanted managers and coaches to treat me when I was a player – but it didn’t often happen.’
