Lavish: Joan Burton spent over ¿5,000 on a staff party

Joan Burton's Department of Social Protection spent more than €5,000 on a lavish staff party just weeks before she introduced swingeing welfare cuts, the Irish Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Guests at the Halloween night bash were treated to a €2,000 buffet and an array of drinks, from Californian wine to Jameson whiskey – all at taxpayers’ expense.

Public money was even used to fund €1,000 worth of spot prizes for guests at the ‘retirement get-together’, which was hosted by department secretary general Niamh O’Donoghue.

The event, at the Department of Social Protection’s Dublin offices, was held on October 31 – even as Ms O’Donoghue was helping Ms Burton decide which areas of social welfare should be cut in the Budget.

Eventually, it was decided to cut child benefit across the board, and to take €325 from the annual respite grant for carers. This directly contravenes the Labour Party’s election campaign promise that they would not touch child benefit.

These cuts have been widely attacked and led to Labour chairman Colm Keaveney voting against his own party’s ratification of the Budget in the Dáil this week.

That rebellion, and Mr Keaveney’s subsequent expulsion from the parliamentary Labour Party, threatens to spark an all-out war in Labour, which could ultimately ­topple the coalition.

Yesterday Mr Keaveney said he agonised over his decision but that two incidents in particular helped him make up his mind.

In an interview with the MoS, he said that during a radio discussion, historian Diarmaid Ferriter posed the question: What does Labour stand for? ‘And I just sat back in the studio in the Dáil and said to myself… he is right.

‘I didn’t sleep from Wednesday to Thursday. On Thursday morning I rang somebody close in my family. I said to my mother, I’m not 100% on this. She said: “I was up in SuperValu and a woman broke down at the till. She hadn’t the money in the purse to pay for the basket of groceries.”’

Starter: Barbecue-glazed cocktail sausages and a selection of sandwiches (some gluten-free) were served

‘It was a culmination of that and I said to myself, I have to do what’s right.’

Labour ministers, led by Pat Rabbitte, defended the cuts to the respite grant this week, saying that Ms Burton had done sterling work defending other areas of social welfare.

Mr Rabbitte sneered over Mr Keaveney’s ‘struggle with his conscience’ and accused him of ‘pirouetting’ on the Leinster House plinth. He argued that in order to save the economy, everyone – even carers – needed to make sacrifices.

However, Mr Rabbitte’s critics will be infuriated to learn that even in Ms Burton’s own department, similar sacrifices are not being made when it comes to entertaining staff (current and former) at taxpayers’ expense.

At the party, there were four cases of red wine and three white, plus a single bottle of Blossom Hill Zinfandel

The total cost of this year’s party was €5,335.60, according to records obtained by the MoS. That represents an increase on 2011, when €4,618.80 was spent to hold the same event.

The October 31 shindig is described in official documents as an ‘annual retirement get-together’. It starts with a Mass at St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral on Marlborough Street, for current, retired and deceased Department of Social Protection workers. Then staff are invited to eat, drink and be merry – without having to worry about the cost.

Catering costs came to €2,990, according to receipts provided for the event, with the food and drink provided by JMW Catering.

Finger food included smoked salmon, fish goujons and chicken satay, along with dessert for 240 people at a cost of €2,160.

A total of €830 in drinks was purchased, consisting of three cases of white wine, four cases of red wine, two bottles of Jameson whiskey, a bottle of Smirnoff vodka, Bacardi rum and gin.

Trays of Guinness cans and Heineken were also laid out, with the remainder of the bill made up of water and soft drinks.

Spot prizes for the assembled guests were also provided courtesy of the taxpayer, with €1,000 spent on 18 One4all gift vouchers.

Before the party even got started the department had spent €699.30 on posting invitations. The department explained this expense: ‘Invitations were issued through the department’s HQ post room. The expenditure is the franking costs to issue these invites.’ There is no invoice for this cost.

Other bills included €20.80 for printing photos, €200 for a PA system, €16 on gift bags and candles, €7.50 on coat hangers and €2 for cloakroom tickets.

Even the organist who provided the music at the Mass was paid for by taxpayers. A similar event last year – also at the end of October and also ahead of a raft of welfare cuts – cost €4,618, according to receipts.

Indulgent: What shindig would be complete without some smoked salmon and a couple of slices of brown bread to set you up for a night's free booze?

Catering for that event, provided in-house, came to €2,466 with a total of €1,800 paid out for food and the rest spent on beverages.

Another €1,000 was spent on vouchers, around half of which went on One4all gift cards, with the rest spent on €50 gift cards for Arnotts and Clerys stores.

The department said it was ‘of course appreciative of the current economic climate’ and had tried to ‘restrict’ expenditure.

The department said: ‘All the arrangements necessary to facilitate the function are ­handled in-house by current staff, the catering is arranged with internal caterers at a reasonable rate, the department uses its own premises.’

The details: Apparently no party is complete without ¿7.50 worth of coat hangers

It also said the party was the only function provided and that other Christmas parties are paid for by staff themselves.

Those affected by the cuts will garner little or no comfort from that fact. A large proportion of carers, for instance, could not hope for enough time off from their caring duties to even attend a Christmas party,  something that’s less likely after the Budget.
