A community in Michigan is in shock after a four-year-old boy and the son of a sheriff’s deputy fatally shot himself on Saturday night.

Michael Easter, the son of Jackson County Sheriff’s Deputy Mark Easter, found a gun and shot himself around 5pm Saturday.

He was at home with his mother, Melissa Easter, at the time of the shooting. According to reports, she first called her husband, who was on his way to work, before dialing 911.

Michigan State Police are now investigating the boy’s tragic death, according to Jackson County Sheriff Steve Rand.

‘It’s been a really tough situation,’ Rand told MLive.com. ‘Nothing that I, or others in the department, would want to go through again.’

Neighbor Holly Brooks told WLNS that she heard the father driving back to his house. ‘It was astronomical that he even made the corner,’ she said.

Another neighbor, Lon Zicafoose, said he saw Easter run into the house and come out yelling and crying minutes later.

His family described Michael as loving, rambunctious, and full of joy

‘He came out and was screaming, “No, no, no,”’ Lon’s son, Riley Zicafoose, told Fox17online.com.Lon Zicafoose said he feels terrible for the family and will give them space to express their grief.

‘I pray the family can get through this,’ he said, but added that he has questions over how Michael had access to the gun in the first place.

It remains unclear how Michael got access to a gun, or how he managed to pull the trigger while under his mother’s supervision.

In his obituary, Michael was described as ‘a joy, a rambunctious and loving son.’

He also leaves behind his two sisters.
