Violet Davies (pictured on her 100th birthday) has been threatened by East Sussex County Council with court action 

A 100-year-old grandmother faces being taken to court on Christmas Eve by ‘heartless’ council officials over a nursing home bill.

Violet Davies, who is deaf and blind, has received letters from East Sussex County Council demanding she pay more than £9,000 in fees for her care.

With less than £3,000 in the bank, Mrs Davies cannot pay. Her only son, Les Davies, 71, says he has repeatedly tried to explain to officials that neither of them can afford the sum.

But to his ‘disgust’, on December 9 the council gave his mother just two weeks to pay or face court action.

It means proceedings against Mrs Davies – who has two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren – could begin on Christmas Eve. 

The letter stated: ‘In the event that you do not respond within fourteen days of the date of this letter we are instructed to issue proceedings, without notice, in the County Court. Any such claim will incur further costs and interest.’

Mr Davies, from Seaford, East Sussex, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year, said: ‘They’re absolutely heartless. I don’t feel like it’s Christmas now. I’m just worried all the time about what’s going to happen with this bill and I haven’t got the money to pay it. 

'How can you threaten to take a 100-year-old woman who is registered blind and deaf to court on Christmas Eve?’

The retired businessman said his illness forced him to put his mother in Queensmead nursing home in January as a ‘last resort’. He and his wife Alice had previously looked after her at home, even building her a basement flat below their house in Newhaven.

Welsh-born Mrs Davies joined the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service in the Second World War, taking food to bombed-out families. She worked as a school housekeeper before settling in Addlestone, Surrey, with her husband Jim.

After he died 33 years ago she volunteered at an elderly people’s day centre. However, by 2003 her sight and hearing had become so poor that she was no longer able to live alone. Mr Davies estimates that he has since spent more than £120,000 on her care.

In April last year he was diagnosed with cancer, and had chemotherapy and several operations. He reluctantly decided to find his mother a home.

Mr Davies says East Sussex council agreed to cover most of her care while she contributed £500 a month. But in September he was told her fees had risen and she owed £9,697 – which came as a ‘complete shock’, he said.

Mrs Davies, with her husband on their wedding day in 1936, cannot afford the £9,000 nursing home fees

Last night the council said it tried to assess her means, but ‘information requested had not been provided’.

A spokesman added: ‘Therefore, we have good grounds to believe this person has the resources to pay… We are happy to work with the family if they believe this assessment is wrong.’

Mr Davies said he provided bank statements for himself and his mother. He added: ‘I’ve only got my pension and my mum hasn’t got any money.’

Caroline Abrahams, of charity Age UK, said it was ‘yet another symptom of a care system under terrible strain’. She added: There’s no avoiding the need for Government to pump more investment into social care.’
