She may have been Ashleigh & Pudsey's biggest fan, but it seems Amanda Holden has some new canine favourites.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 43, was pictured cuddling up to a trio of loveable puppies at Crufts 2014 today.

Looking bronzed and glamorous in a slinky white mini dress, the mother-of-two held all three police dogs in her arms.

She posed for photographers at the NEC in Birmingham, to support the Act on Lungworm campaign which encourages dog owners to speak to their vet and protect their pet.

Dogs can become infected with the potentially fatal parasite after accidentally swallowing slugs or snails carrying the lungworm larvae.

Meanwhile, TOWIE star and fashion designer Lydia Bright also turned up, wearing an ice blue cable knit jumper, printed slim-fit trousers and silver brogues.

The brunette cuddled up to the police puppies who were eager to give her a kiss - which she duly returned.

The competition promises to yield some terrific photo opportunities in the next three days, as breeds big and small strut their stuff in various tests.

Furthermore, with London Fashion Week over, it was time for our four-legged friends to show us what they have hanging in their own Spring/Summer 2014 wardrobes.

Packs of elegant terriers and hounds sashayed through the streets of Birmingham ready to 
compete, clad in 
protective raincoats keeping their fur silky and dry.

The puppy-razzi lined the streets of Birmingham this morning ready to snap today's entries in the Terrier and Hound Groups breeds category entering the arena.

Many were wrapped up in multi-coloured waterproof all-in-ones, and some even wore little dog wellies.

Recognised Kennel Club breeds were lead into the arena by their nervous owners, to take their seats in the arena corridors and prepare for their presentation.

The four-day event is the world's largest dog show.

Yesterday featured competitions from 9am until 5.15pm with categories including agility, freestyle and heelwork to music. There were various displays from groups including the the West Midlands Police and the East Anglian Staffordshire Bull Terriers.

Over the event, there are also a number of events solely for children and their dogs.

Today's competition is for Terrier and Hound breeds, Saturday's is for Toy and Utility breeds, and on Sunday the Gundogs will compete.

Crufts is one of the largest dog events in the world, celebrating every aspect dogs play in our lives.

It has changed in ways that couldnâ€™t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in Victorian times by the late Charles Cruft. Although it was a very different event in 1891 Charles Cruft was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today, which is an essential date in any dog loverâ€™s calendar.

Crufts began in the Victorian period, set up by dog fanatic and showman Charles Cruft in 1891 to celebrate out four-legged friends and the role they play in our lives.

It has evolved since the 19th century, but still has this celebration of dogs at its heart. As organisers say: 'Judges are trained to ensure that only healthy dogs win prizes, which in turn encourages the breeding of healthy dogs. But the event is now about so much more besides.

'Crufts is ultimately a celebration of all dogs. It celebrates working dogs, which are fit and healthy enough to perform the jobs for which they were originally bred, such as those in the Gamekeeper classes or which line up for the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year award, and it hails hero dogs through the Friends for Life competition.

'Rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever-popular competitions of Flyball and Heelwork to Music.'

The first Crufts show was held in 1891 in the Royal Agricultural Hall in Islington.
