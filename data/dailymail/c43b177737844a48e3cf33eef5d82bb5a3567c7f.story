More than two decades have passed since her Dallas heyday as Sue Ellen.

And now aged 74, time appears not to have diminished Linda Gray's good looks nor her joie de vivre.

The actress, who portrayed an alcoholic wife of devious oilman JR Ewing in the BBC series, prompted a flurry of compliments from the Loose Women panellists as she took her seat at the coffee table of the popular lunchtime ITV show yesterday.

Miss Gray, who played Sue Ellen in the show attributes her good looks to clean living and avoiding fad diets

Miss Gray, who could easily pass for a woman in her 40s, initially laughed off the questions asking her for the secret behind her glossy hair and youthful skin but later joked: 'I've had a facelift.'

The star, who is set to make her pantomime debut as the Fairy Godmother in New Wimbledon Theatre's Cinderella, has often credited her healthy lifestyle for helping her maintain her beauty and slender figure.

She confirmed on the show that she walks most days and in the past has said: 'I don't do fad things or diets – they don't work. If you have a -delicious piece of bread and you want it, then have it.

'But don't have it every day. I love dark chocolate but I will have a piece just occasionally.

'It is not about being thin. It is about staying healthy and fit. I need to live a long time to fulfil all the things I want to do. I want to be walking around at 90.'

Miss Gray, a mother of two, won numerous awards for playing JR Ewing's long-suffering wife Sue Ellen in the American hit soap Dallas from 1978 to 1991 which was shown in Britain by the BBC.

The former model reprised the role in a new series of the much-loved American drama in 2011 but the show was axed once more earlier this year.
