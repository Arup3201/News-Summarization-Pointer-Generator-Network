A Purple Heart medal posthumously awarded to a soldier who died in Vietnam is being returned to his family 15 years after it was found on a school playground.

Thomas McGraw, from North Syracuse, New York, was killed in 1966, aged 19, and his teenage widow and young daughter were presented with the medal after his death.

The Purple Heart later disappeared and turned up in the late 1990s, when a young boy found it outside an elementary school in Syracuse. 

Honor: The posthumous medal of Pfc. Thomas McGraw, who died in Vietnam aged 19, is being returned to his family 15 years after it was stolen

Robyn DeCuffa, 51, was just three when she lost her father, and the medal was one of very few mementos she had left of him.

The mother-of-eight had been given the medal by her mother Sarah, who had become a widow at 19 when Pfc. McGraw was killed in an ambush in February 1966 while serving with the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. 

Reunited: Pfc. McGraw's daughter Robyn DeCuffa, 51, thought her father's medal was lost forever

It was stolen from Ms DeCuffa some 15 years ago, and foundby a fourth-grader outside a school in Liverpool, New York.

In January this year, the mother of the boy who found the medal contacted Purple Hearts Reunited, an organisation which returns lost or stolen military medals to their rightful owners, which tracked down Ms DeCuffa and her mother.

'I was actually shocked,' Ms DeCuffa,  of Cortland, told the Syracuse Post-Standard.

'I thought the Purple Heart was gone forever. That was basically all I had from my father.'

The Purple Heart is  awarded to those serving in the US army who have been wounded or killed while on active duty, on or after April 5, 1917.

Purple Hearts Reunited, founded by Captain Zac Fike, a member of the Army National Guard in Vermont, says Pfc. Thomas McGraw's medal will be presented to the family at a ceremony in Manlius, near Syracuse, next month.

'It really is quite an amazing story,' Ms DeCuffa told the paper.

'What this captain has done, returning medals to families, is such a fine act. 

'I thought I would never see the medal again.

'It may seem small to other people, but when your father sacrifices his life for his country, that's really all you have.'
