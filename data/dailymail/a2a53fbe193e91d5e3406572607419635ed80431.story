Some of Australia's most iconic landmarks and locations could be underwater in less than a century, according to a new report by the Climate Council.

By 2100 Sydney Opera House could flood every single day, the Gold Coast's famous beaches could be swallowed by the sea, and more than 250,000 homes across the country could be destroyed.

Titled Counting The Costs: Climate Change And Coastal Flooding, the report reveals that more than half the Australian coast could be in jeopardy over the next 100 years.

The Sydney Opera house could be flooded every day by 2100 according to a new report by the Climate Council

The report revealed that more than $200 billion worth of damage could be done to infrastructure if the sea rises the worst case scenario of 1.1 metres

'Australia is largely a coastal country. Much of our population lives on or near the coast, and our six state capital cities —Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Hobart, as well as Darwin in the Northern Territory—are all port cities,' the report begins.

In Victoria at least 80 percent of the coast could be at risk of rising seas, while it's a little lower but still damaging at 62 percent in Queensland.

One of the authors of the report, Professor Will Steffen, told news.com.au that it is essential for Australia to cut its greenhouse gases if we want to reduce the potential impact.

Queensland's iconic Gold Coast could also be in jeopardy if the sea levels rise by the turn of the century

One of the authors of the report, Professor Will Steffen, said its essential for Australia to cut its greenhouse gases if we want to reduce the potential impact

'The potential threats to Australia, where the majority of us live on the coast are disproportionately large,' he said in a statement.

If the sea rises just over a metre by the turn of the century roads, hospitals, properties, and power stations would all be severly damaged.

In the worst case scenario this damage to the coastal regions of the country could cost the economy over $200 billion, according to the report. 

Almost 250,000 homes could be lost along the Australian coast 

The Climate Council warns against ignoring climate change as that could have a detrimental effect on the world's economy

There is also a suggestion that the Gold Coast could be hardest hit, which would mean a huge blow to the tourism profits more than 11 million visitors bring the beachside region each year. 

As the beaches are lined with high rises so any rise in the sea level could be derimental to the surrounding areas.

More than 250,000 homes across Australia could also be at serious risk along with 35,000 kilometres of roads and rails, thousands of commercial buildings and almost 100 hospitals.

The overall prediction is that sea levels will rise by between 40 centimetres and one metre.

The report also revealed that rising sea levels could pose risks to the Great Barrier Reef, and Kakadu National Park.

The Climate Council is a not-for-profit organisation which relies on funding from the public.

In Victoria at least 80 percent of the coast could be at risk of rising seas, while that figure is 62 percent for Queensland
