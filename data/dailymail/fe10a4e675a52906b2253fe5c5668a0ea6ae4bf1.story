Thousands of people took to the streets of Buenos Aires on Wednesday night to celebrate Argentina's World Cup semi-final victory over the Netherlands.

Fans gathered clad in shirts and hats bearing the sky blue and white colors of their flag to celebrate the victory.

Fans
 said their team's victories at the World Cup have softened the 
financial struggles of the country that finds itself teetering on the 
brink of another default on its foreign debts.

'Argentina
 deserved to have this joy because we are doing badly otherwise,' said 
Norma Ontiveros, 59. 'This way we can show that not everything is wrong.
 We have a solid team and good people."'

The considerable amount of Argentinians who traveled to Brazil for the tournament wept, kissed and raised their hands to the sky when their team won 4-2 on penalty kicks, sending them to the final for the first time in more than two decades.

'God knows we suffered, but now everything is good,' said a weeping fan Rodrigo Aisen, who sealed the win by giving his girlfriend a long kiss. 'Everything is joy!"'

The 23-year-old celebrated with 20,000 others in the FIFA Fan Fest watch party in Sao Paulo, following a tense match in which neither team scored until the penalty shootout.

Argentina and Germany will meet in the final on Sunday.

'I had faith that they would win today,' said Maribel Oviedo, 21, who two years ago had a lung transplant because of cystic fibrosis. Her twin sister died from the disease last year.

Her family traveled from Cordoba, Argentina, to see the World Cup, and Oviedo said making the final means more to her than any other sporting achievement.

'Seeing the team in these moments gives me goose bumps. It is something beautiful,' she said.

For
 Brazilians, the hard-fought win by Argentina only rubbed salt in the 
wound of their own team's worst World Cup defeat in Tuesday's match with
 Germany.

'If
 Argentina wins this Cup here in Brazil, we might as well just close the
 coffin,' said Silvio Martines, 32. 'You can bury Brazil. It would be 
our last blow'
