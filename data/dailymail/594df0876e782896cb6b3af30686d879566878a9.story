These pictures show the stunning transformation of a teenage cancer patient into a bodybuilder, whose inspiring selfies have earned him a massive online following.

Zach Zeiler, from Ida, Michigan, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in 2010 at the age of 15 - which saw his weight plummet to just 100lbs.

But as his photos show, Zach went on to beat cancer and now weighs nearly 175lbs.

His impressive physique is the result of working out for two hours each and every day - which he began during treatment.

Zach, now 20, said: 'I started lifting after my radiation treatments because I knew it would help me gain weight and look less sickly.

'It was a great way to channel a lot of the anger I felt - and I got addicted to it, it became my passion.'

But now, he's a social media star with a YouTube account that has amassed more than 11 million views and he has over 68,000 fans on Facebook.

Zach was diagnosed with stage 1B Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which is fatal if detected in the later stages.

His 1B stage diagnosis meant that he showed alternative symptoms, such as night sweats, that indicated the disease was advancing. 

Doctors immediately put him into aggressive chemo and radiation therapies.

Zach's diagnosis came as a shock to his family - who knew him as an athletic and healthy teenager.

Zach Zeiler, pictured in the hospital in Michigan in May 2010, began working out so he would look 'less sickly'

His mother, Joanna Zeiler, 48, said: 'One day Zach was laying down in my room. I passed by and he said to me, "mom I'm sorry I soaked your bed."

'He was covered in sweat from head to toe.

'I was noticing more and more that he would come home drained, which was unlike him because he was very athletic.'

She added: 'My father passed away from Hodgkins as well, so we started seeing the same symptoms in Zach and suspecting he had it too.

'It was the first time I ever saw my father cry.

'Everyone was upset - I was the only one who was calm for the most part.' 

At his lowest, Zach weighed just 100lbs but now weighs nearly 175lbs after putting all his anger into exercise

Zach's girlfriend, Tara Hurley, 21, was also distraught upon hearing about his illness - but stood by him throughout his treatment.

Joanna, a children's day care worker, said: 'I'll never forget the look in her eyes when we drove to her house and told her diagnosis.

'I pulled her in close and put her head on my shoulder. She was absolutely devastated.'

Zach added: 'I asked Tara out two months before my diagnosis - I snuck over to her house on Christmas Day and wrote out "will you go out with me" in Lincoln Logs.

'We have been together for almost five years now - and she's been by my side through everything.'

Zach and Tara, pictured in June 2012, have been together for five years. 'She's been by my side through everything,' he said 

Now, Zach posts videos on his YouTube channel in the hope of inspiring others. 

'My friends and family were impressed as I progressed in terms of gaining muscle - and it meant a lot to me.

'Hearing the compliments and having people noticing the changes in my body helped to keep me motivated in pushing further.'

'I don't plan on stopping any time soon - I would really like to continue to inspire as many people as possible to follow through with their goals.

Zach, who eats at least 4,000 calories a day, hopes to inspire others by posting his workouts on social media

'I am in pursuit of developing my own online personal training website, where I can work one on one with individuals to help them reach their goals.

'I plan to continue on building my body not only for the physical aspect, but to ensure that I live a healthy life.'

He adds he is conscious of what goes into his body, tracking his calorie intake and portioning out his meals. 

He said: 'I eyeball my calorie consumption, and try my best to meet my protein requirements.

'I consume anywhere from 4,000 to 4,500 calories a day to maintain my body weight - these calories are taken in over a series of six to eight portioned meals.'
