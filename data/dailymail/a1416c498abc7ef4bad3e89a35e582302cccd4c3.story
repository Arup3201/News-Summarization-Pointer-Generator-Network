A man was left with a breast implant in the back of his head while undergoing surgery to repair a giant scar caused by a botched hair transplant.

Mike, a personal trainer from Michigan, was self-conscious about his receding hairline at the age of 23 and visited a Beverly Hills surgeon, but the procedure left an 11-inch scar, he revealed on Sunday's episode of E!'s Botched.

To correct the scar, Mike visited Dr Paul Nassif and Dr Terry Dubrow for a consultation.

The doctors said that the skin was tight around the scar area, but they could put a breast implant in the back of his head and fill it with saline over the course of a week to help stretch the skin, giving them more tissue to work with.

Fortunately, Mike was able to see the humor in the situation.

'There’s always a small chance that something could go wrong and you could die. That’s part of any surgery,' he said.

Risky business: 'There's always a small chance that something could go wrong and you could die. That's part of any surgery,' Mike said

'But if I did, it would be such a way to go. I mean, with a boob in the back of my head, in a plastic surgery office, face down on an operating table on Rodeo Drive!'

Dr Dubrow explained that they filled the tissue expander to 170 cubic centimeters, which is about the size of B cup.

'Over the next week, we plan to expand it further to about a small D,' he added.

Success: Dr Nassif said the skin 'closed beautifully, without any tension'

Eventually, the saline bag was removed and the area was stitched up, though the doctors warned it would take more time for the swelling to disappear completely.

Dr Nassif revealed: 'It closed beautifully, without any tension.'
