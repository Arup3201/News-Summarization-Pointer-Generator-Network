A teenager could face up to 20 years in prison after being caught driving a Humvee taken from an Army Reserve station on the wrong side of the road.

Jacob Russell Durant, 19, was stopped by officers driving the armoured car late on Friday night in Birmingham, Alabama.

It came after the Shelby County Sheriff's Office received reports of the Humvee travelling down the wrong side of the road and without any headlights.

The 19-year-old was arrested after being pulled over and charged with receiving stolen property.

The charge is a first degree felony, which can carry up to 20 years in a federal prison.

He is now being held in the Shelby County jail on a $10,000 bond and has no listed attorney.

It is believed the Humvee came from an Army Reserve station on Green Springs Highway in Birmingham.

He vehicle was eventually released back to the 5th Medical Brigade unit.

The Humvee, pictured, is widely used in the American military and come with a 6.2 litre V8 engine (file picture) 

The Humvee stands for High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle and is widely used in the American army, navy, marine corps and air force.

They are known for their reliability and come with a 6.2 litre V-8 engine and weigh 5,200 pounds.

Last month, the military began selling the vehicles to the public for the first time.

Since then, dozens of Humvees have been auctioned off, some for as much as $41,000.

This is despite the vehicles not being street legal and only designed for off-road use.
