A Texas high school has today been evacuated and a student is in custody after a potential bomb was found in a backpack on campus.

Officials at Katy Independent Schools District said all 3,000 students at Seven Lakes High School, located around 20 miles west of Houston, were evacuated to the football stadium at around 10 a.m. after police learned of a perceived threat on the school grounds.

Around 11 a.m., the school notified parents that authorities had found what appeared to be an explosive device in one of the buildings and that the Houston bomb squad was en route to the campus.

At 12:45 p.m., students were moved to
 the Seven Lakes Junior High stadium and their anxious parents collected
 them at 1:30 p.m.Â 

According to ABC News, a suspicious-looking backpack was found on the east side of the school.

The
 FBI sent special agents to assist HPD, Katy police and the Harris 
County Sheriff's Office to determine what, if any, threat was posed by 
the package.

The bomb squad spent the afternoon conducting a thorough sweep of all school buildings. It's not yet clear whether the potential explosive device was a hoax or not.

Also today, a New Jersey high school was evacuated after a message was found on a bathroom wall.

Police said the Morris County bomb 
squad responded to the Pequannock Township High School this afternoon. 
It's unclear what was written on the wall.

The
 school tweeted that students were being dismissed early because of the 
'emergency situation,' and said parents could pick up their children.

'There will be no access to the school or school grounds until further notice,' the school said.
