The unarmed college student fatally 
shot by a campus police officer in the early hours of Saturday morning had taken LSD and assaulted 
three people before chasing him, authorities have revealed.

Gil Collar, 18, took the drug at an outdoor music festival before assaulting two people in vehicles and trying to bite a woman's arm, Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran said at a news conference on Tuesday.

The University of South Alabama freshman then went to the campus police headquarters, 
where he was shot by the officer, who has been identified as 27-year-old Trevis Austin.

Austin, who has been an officer for four years, is 
on leave while investigators look into the death.

He had come outside the police headquarters when he heard Collar, a 5-foot-7, 135-pound former high school 
wrestler, banging on its door, Cochran said.

Surveillance footage showed Collar naked and covered in sweat as he chased the officer for more than 50 feet, Fox News reported.

When the student got within five feet of the officer, Austin, who was not armed with pepper spray or a baton, as is required of campus officers, shot once and struck him in the chest.

'Had the officer had a Taser or some other less lethal instrument I 
don't know if that officer would have had an opportunity to shoulder his
pistol and to use something else because the events were evolving so 
rapidly and he was approaching so close,' Cochran said.

He added that he had been extremely concerned when first hearing about the shooting, but understood why the officer had chosen to open fire after watching the video.

The authorities will not be releasing the footage publicly, he added.

Investigators are now looking into 
who gave Collar the LSD and could charged them with murder. Cochran 
revealed that people at the concert with the teenager had told them 
about his drug use.

LSD,
is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug also known as acid. It is usually 
added to absorbent paper, such as blotter paper, divided into small 
squares and taken orally.

The
effects of LSD are unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the 
user's personality and mood, and the surroundings in which the drug is 
used.

It can cause anxiety, panic, paranoia, psychotic 
behavior and an inability to recognize danger. If taken in a large enough dose, the drug produces delusions and visual hallucinations.

Physical
effects include dilated pupils, higher body temperature, increased 
heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, loss of appetite, 
sleeplessness, dry mouth, and tremors.

The effects of LSD last for hours, typically clearly after 12 hours.

LSD, which is also 
known as acid, can cause anxiety, paranoia, psychotic 
behavior and an inability to recognise danger, effects which typically last for around 12 hours.

The revelations come after Collar's 
mother, Bonnie Smith Collar, said the surveillance video shows that her 
son never came into physical contact with the officer.

Acquaintances had said that Collar appeared to be 
intoxicated as he took his 
clothes off, ran through the streets, screamed obscenities and claimed 
he was on a 'spiritual quest' before he was killed.

'Whatever caused the incident was something that made him act not in his normal personality,' she said.

Mrs Collar said she had no idea why 
her son would be acting erratically as described and that the slight yet
strong boy had never posed a threat before.

'The
first thing on my mind is, freshman kids do stupid things,' she said. 
'Campus police should be equipped to handle activity like that without 
having to use lethal force.'

An
attorney for the family, former Alabama Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, said his
firm's review of the shooting would include whether the officer 
followed department rules and regulations.

The case has been handed over to 
Mobile County authorities and could take weeks to resolve. Meanwhile, 
friends and relatives are trying to figure out what could have happened 
to the quiet kid who showed so much promise.

Collar grew up in the rural outskirts
of Wetumpka, about 20 miles north of Montgomery. Brandon Ross, a 
sophomore at Jacksonville State University, said Collar moved to the 
neighborhood as an eight-year-old.

'I was the first person he met on the bus, and we've been friends ever since,' he said. 'He was the kid everybody liked.'

'It's completely opposite of the way 
he was,' said South Alabama student Chandler Wescovich of Long Beach, 
Miss., who became friends with Collar during his short time on campus.

Others
agreed the actions were out of character for the normally quiet and 
reserved Collar, whom friends described as a popular and good-looking 
high school wrestler.

Collar
wasn't known as a troublemaker and had only two minor scrapes with the 
law, according to court records: a speeding ticket and a citation for 
being a minor in possession of three cigarettes in March. He paid a $25 
fine for the tobacco possession.

He was also so good-looking that his teammates didn't like standing next to him in team photos.

'The girls thought he was the best thing they had ever seen, and they may have been right,' Glass said.

A candlelight vigil is planned for 6 p.m. Tuesday at Wetumpka High School. Collar's mother said funeral arrangements have not yet been made yet.

On the Facebook page for the Vanguard,
the school's student newspaper, Collar's friends and classmates 
expressed confusion that the officer felt the need to use deadly force 
on the young man.

'Gil 
went to my high school' wrote Melissa Mims, who said she was a good 
friend of Collar's sister Elisabeth and the rest of his family.

'Gil was the kind of guy who could put a smile on anyone's face, he never 
had any enemies and a lot of students and younger kids looked up to him.
He really was a great guy and had very many friends.'

Friend Lucas Self described Collar as an easy going person, small enough deadly force should not have been required.

'Gil made a mistake but it is still an officers 
duty to resolve a situation as peacefully as he can' Self wrote. 'I think this 
situation was handled wrong by the officer but they aren't going to let 
any one believe that.'
