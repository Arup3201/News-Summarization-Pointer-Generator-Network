Two skin cancer drugs previously denied to NHS patients are now saving lives after finally getting the green light from the Government’s drugs rationing body.

Yervoy and Zelboraf have been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence – which initially said they were too expensive – and are now being offered to patients whose tumours have spread to other parts of the body. This once meant almost certain death.

The drugs are being hailed as one of the biggest breakthroughs in treating advanced malignant melanoma in three decades.

Green light: The drugs, previously considered too expensive for NHS patients, was given the go-ahead by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence

The Mail on Sunday campaigned for the drugs to be offered to all NHS patients.

At the time of our campaign, one cancer doctor said: ‘Yervoy can prolong patients’ lives, possibly for years. Some people from the first UK trials in 2007 are still alive.’

Dr James Larkin, a medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, who ran clinical trials of Zelboraf, has seen tumours in patients’ livers shrink and in some cases disappear altogether.

‘There had been a perception among doctors that melanoma was different and impossible to treat,’ he said. ‘This drug shows that isn’t the case and at last we have hope in our fight against this terrible cancer.’

Zelboraf is one of a new class of ‘personalised’ medicines and will help the 50 per cent of malignant melanoma patients who carry a particular genetic mutation of the disease.

Although it isn’t a cure, it has been shown to extend life from nine months to 16 months, opening up the prospect that malignant melanoma, similar to some other cancers, could be contained, if not cured.

Charlie Jones, 24, suffering with malignant melanoma that spread to his stomach and kidney, was given just days to live ten months ago.

Oncologists at the Christie Hospital in Manchester gave him the chance to try Zelboraf and there was an almost immediate response. The tumours stopped growing and then began to shrink. The drug has kept the disease at bay and has given Charlie hope for the future.

‘I have become stronger and stronger,’ he says. ‘I feel a lot better – like the old me.’

Paul Lorigan, Charlie’s oncologist at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, said: ‘There have been, until now, a large number of patients for whom we could do no more. Now we have options where for years there was nothing.’
