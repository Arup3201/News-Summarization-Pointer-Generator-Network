New Crystal Palace signing Martin Kelly attempted to make light of Tony Pulis' departure just hours after he had brought him to the club.

The former Liverpool defender joined the Eagles in a £1.5m deal on Thursday, but no sooner had the ink dried on his contract than Pulis quit the club following a disagreement over transfers with co-owner Steve Parish.

A message posted on the club's Twitter account revealed: 'KM says new signing Martin Kelly joked this morning: "I didn't think I trained that badly yesterday!"

Where Eagles dare: Martin Kelly signed for Crystal Palace shortly before Tony Pulis' departure

New dawn: The former Liverpool defender was previously excited about starting his new career at Selhurst

The 24-year-old had previously posted his own message on Thursday, thanking Liverpool fans for their support before saying: 'Now to start a new chapter of my football career at crystal palace a great club with unbelievable fans excited already for the weekend'.

Whether Kelly still feels the same way now that the man responsible for bringing him to Selhurst Park has gone is open to question. 

The England international made his Reds debut back in 2009 but found first-team opportunities limited, with a serious knee injury also ruling him out for a year.

He is one of only two significant arrivals at the club this summer alongside Cardiff striker Frazier Campbell, while Pulis is reported to have left after the board failed to back moves for the likes of Steven Caulker, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Michu.

Technical coach Dave Kemp will take charge of the team at Arsenal on Saturday but will then also leave. Keith Millen will help him and stay on in a coaching role.
