A celebrity hairdresser whose clients include the Duchess of Cambridge has been fined £40,000 after one of his stylists suffered third degree burns in a fire at his salon.

Stylist Gail Purcell received serious burns after an accident at the boutique owned by Daniel Hersheson, who has styled the hair of countless celebrities at the salon over the years, when her skirt was set alight by a candle used to create atmosphere.

Hersheson is the head of a family beauty dynasty which includes wife Ruth, son Luke and daughter Lauren, and whose clients have included Kate Middleton, socialite Tara Palmer Tomkinson, model Pixie Geldof and actress Sienna Miller.

Accident: Gail Purcell suffered third degree burns when her clothes caught fire at the salon in West London

According to statements gathered by London Fire Brigade safety inspectors, Ms Purcell had to run to different parts of the building in Conduit Street trying to find water and help to put the fire out.

Hersheson spends most of his working time at the Conduit Street branch but also works one day a week at Harvey Nichols.

No fire alarm sounded, no one appeared to know what to do and no first aid was given before paramedics arrived at the blaze in 26 May 2009.

Ms Purcell was taken to Chelsea and Westminster hospital following the fire and was found to have suffered third degree burns.

London Fire Brigade were not called to the blaze but attended the flagship boutique on 29 May 2009 to conduct a fire safety inspection, where a number of serious safety concerns emerged.

They found fire doors at the luxury salon were propped open, storage was blocking some of the corridors, fire alarms were faulty and there was a substandard fire risk assessment in place.

Rudan Ltd, trading as Daniel 
Hersheson, pleaded guilty to two offences under the Regulatory Reform 
(Fire Safety) Order 2005 - failure to make a suitable and sufficient 
fire risk assessment and failure to provide staff with adequate and 
regular safety training.

The
 company was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court today yesterday and 
ordered to pay a fine of £10,000 for each of the two offences and 
£20,000 costs.

LFB’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Fire Safety Regulation Lee Phillpotts said: 'Business owners have a clear responsibility under fire safety law to ensure that both the public and their employees are safe from the risk of fire.

'This verdict sends a clear message that if these responsibilities are ignored we will not hesitate in prosecuting and serious penalties are likely to be imposed.

'People should always be extremely careful when using candles. You should never leave them unattended and keep them well away from any flammable materials.'
