A toddler had to be resuscitated after holding his breath while he had a tantrum playing with his brother and sisters.

Donna High feared her son Kyle Parker had ‘gone’ when he stopped breathing and went ‘grey and floppy’.

But thanks to the life-saving actions of neighbour Barbara Osborne, the 19-month-old is back on his feet.

Ms High, 31, said: 'He was playing, but when he doesn’t get his own way he holds his breath. We’re used to it and I blow on his face when he does it. But this time I couldn’t bring him back.

'If Barbara hadn’t been there I don’t know what I would have done. I was panicking and I thought there was no chance.

'I thought he was gone. It was the worst day of my life. I would never want anybody to have to go through that.

'I need the world to know how thankful I am to her. I know paramedics were on the scene a short time after but it was her that saved him.'

Kyle stopped breathing as he played with his twin brother Kaiden and sisters Kelsey, 11, Ellie-Mae, eight, and Shelby, six.

Ms High added: 'He just went grey and floppy in my arms.'

Ms High raced out of her home at Brambles Farm, Middlesbrough, last Tuesday, looking for help and ran to her friend Ms Osborne’s house.

Paramedics arrived on scene a short time 
later and took Kyle to the James Cook University Hospital (pictured) in 
Middlesbrough. Just 40 minutes later he was back to his usual ‘cheeky 
and mischievous’ self

She said: 'I wasn’t thinking properly. I was traumatised. I ran out the front door. Usually there are people all over but there was nobody around.

'I ran to my neighbour’s house screaming. I shot him to my friend’s mum and she told me to phone an ambulance.'

It was while Ms High was calling for help that Ms Osborne brought Kyle back to life.

The 57-year-old said: 'Donna came running in screaming: ‘My baby is dead’. He was blue there was nothing there at all. I think adrenaline just kicked in and I got on with it. I checked his mouth to check he wasn’t choking and then gave him mouth-to-mouth.

'It seemed like a long time but it was probably only like three or four minutes.'

She said Kyle came round momentarily before going ashen again so she carried on resuscitating him until he started making gulping and swallowing noises.

Paramedics arrived on scene a short time later and took Kyle to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Just 40 minutes later he was back to his usual ‘cheeky and mischievous’ self.

Ms High is now waiting on test results to see if there are any medical reasons that could have caused Kyle to stop breathing.

She added that if it wasn’t for Ms Osborne she doesn’t believe Kyle would have survived.

'A lot of people would have been too scared and would not know what to do. It was so lucky that she was there. My kids are my life. Flowers or a card are not enough, how do you thank someone for saving your son?'

Ms Osborne said it was due to first aid training she got as a teaching assistant that she knew what to do.

She said: 'Everyone was panicking and didn’t know what to do. It just shows how important it is to learn first aid.'

A spokeswoman for the North East Ambulance Service said: 'We are delighted that Kyle is back to normal, and we would like to congratulate and applaud the neighbour for their quick intervention.

'As an emergency service, we encourage as many people as possible to learn basic lifesaving skills.

'The techniques are really simple, and can keep someone alive until a patient is attended to by a medical professional.'
