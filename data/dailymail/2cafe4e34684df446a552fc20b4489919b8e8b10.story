West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison has been freed from custody after a judge granted him bail following a private court hearing.

The 21-year-old was in custody and not present at Manchester Crown Court to hear the bail application made by his lawyers.

Former Manchester United midfielder Morrison is accused of two counts of common assault on his ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor, 19 and her mother Parveen Mansoor, 39, in the early hours of last Sunday morning.

He was refused bail by District Judge James Prowse at his first court appearance at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Thursday and spent the weekend in custody.

On Monday, Judge Michael Henshall granted Morrison bail.

An
 application to allow the press and public into court for the 
hearing was rejected by the judge and the hearing went ahead in private.

Morrison was given bail but his bail conditions were not given by the court following a request from the press.

Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison only appeared in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was soon shipped out to Birmingham and QPR on loan.

Morrison is next due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
