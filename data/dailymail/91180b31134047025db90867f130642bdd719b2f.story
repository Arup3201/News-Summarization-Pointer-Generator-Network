President Barack Obama rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin today for not using his influence to stop Russian separatists in Ukraine from 'tampering' with evidence at the site of the MH17 crash.

Speaking from South Lawn of the White House, the U.S. president said it's Putin's 'responsibility to compel' the rebels to cease removing bodies from the area and allow investigators to have 'immediate and full access' to the site so they can conduct a thorough investigation.

'That's the least that we can do. That's the least that decency demands,' he said.

The separatists' behavior begs the question, 'what exactly are they trying to hide?' Obama asked at one point in his remarks. 'This is an insult to those who have lost loved ones.'

Obama's solemn statement comes a day after Senators on the committees that oversee international affairs criticized him for inadequately responding to the ongoing violence in Ukraine.

The president has also been pilloried for devoting just 40 seconds of a 16 minute transportation speech on the day of the Malaysia Airlines crash to the tragedy and for spending his evening attending Democratic Party fundraisers while his national security team handled the the U.S.'s response.

This is an insult: President Barack Obama urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to compel Russian separatists to cease their efforts of hindering investigators at the site of last week's Malaysian Airlines disaster

Victims of the plane crash were gathered on Sunday and piled onto vehicles before being taken to a train station in rebel-held Torez, nine miles from the crash site

In remarks on Friday and this morning on the plane crash, Obama took a more serious approach to discussing the calamity and warned the Kremlin that there would be consequences if it continued to aid and abet the separatists.

Responding to a statement from Putin yesterday in which he publicly threw his support behind an international investigation into the downing of the plane, Obama said the Russian leader's words 'have to be supported by actions.'

'Time is of the essence,' Obama said. 'Families deserve to be able to lay their loved ones to rest with dignity.'

'My preference continues to be finding a diplomatic resolution within Ukraine,' he noted. 'I believe that can still happen.'

But if Russia keeps supporting the separatists, he said, it 'will only further isolate itself from the international community, and the costs for its behavior 'will only continue to increase.'

Obama did not elaborate on what those costs would be, however. The immediate concern for world leaders, he said, is investigating the crash. 

The president said 
 he'd spoken to many world leaders throughout the last four days since Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by BUK-M1 surface-to-air missiles, killing 298 people, and 'all of them 
remain in a state of shock' as well as 'outrage.'

'We have to make sure that the truth is out and that accountability exists,' the U.S. president said.

President Obama signed an executive order baring the federal government and its contracting agencies from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity this morning before giving remarks on the situation in Ukraine

Over the weekend images emerged of crash victims in body bags baking in the sun on the side of the road.

The bodies were later tossed into dirty trucks and transported to a train station  where they were supposed to be loaded into a refrigerated car and shipped to a rebel-controlled town 50 miles away.

The cooling system in the car was reportedly not working overnight, however, and the bodies have been allowed to rot.

Yesterday U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed reports of 'drunken separatist soldiers unceremoniously piling bodies into trucks, removing both bodies, as well as evidence, from the site.'

'What's happening is really grotesque. And it is contrary to everything that President Putin and Russia said that they would do,' Kerry said.

'This is the kind of behavior that has no place in the community of nations,' Obama said today.

Ranking Republican member on the Senate Foreign Relations committee Bob Corker called the situation 'incredibly tragic.'

'What is also tragic is the response that the 
West has given up until this point,' Corker, a Republican, told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace.

'And in many ways, because of that 
cautious response, Russia has continued to foment all the problems that 
they've created in Eastern Ukraine.'

Committee chairman Bob Menendez, a Democrat, also expressed discontent with Obama's handing of Putin since the Russian-backed separatists invaded Ukraine this spring.

'Clearly President Putin has created the set of circumstances and has 
supplied the resources … to the rebels so that this tragedy could take 
place,' Menendez told Wallace yesterday, according to The Hill.

'For me, I think the West, including the [United 
States], has to have a far more significant response than we’ve seen to 
date.'

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a Facebook Q and A this afternoon that she agrees with the president's statements this morning but indicated that she thinks the U.S. should be sending a stronger message to Putin.

'We should work to bring our European allies together with us on tougher sanctions that would make it clear to Putin that there is a price to pay for this kind of behavior and we should encourage Europeans to start immediately to make sure they are less dependent on Russian energy so they are not intimidated,' she said.

'Finally, I would like to see more support given to the Ukrainians to guard their borders and to protect themselves.'

In a statement of his own, Putin accused his critics yesterday of politicizing the plane crash while simultaneously placing the blame on Ukraine for inciting the attack.

'Nobody should and has no right to use this tragedy to achieve their narrowly selfish political goals,' Putin said in a televised address.

'We repeatedly called upon all conflicting sides to stop the bloodshed immediately and sit down at the negotiating table. I can say with confidence that if military operations were not resumed on June 28 in eastern Ukraine, this tragedy wouldn’t have happened.'

Today Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk pointed the finger back at Putin, claiming his country is aligned with the 'devil.'

'I do not expect anything from the Russian government. They supplied weapons, they sent in fighters. Putin should understand that it's enough already,' Yatseniuk said. 'This is not a conflict between Ukraine and Russia. It is an international conflict.

'Russia is on the dark side, on the side of the devil,' he claimed.

British Prime Minister David Cameron today called the plane crash an 'appalling tragedy' and said he hoped Putin would 'use this moment to find a path out of 
this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia's support for the 
separatists.'
