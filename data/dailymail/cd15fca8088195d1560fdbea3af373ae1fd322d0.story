Forster added that he was considerate with the use of blood and gores because of the show's G rating.

'Blood was used sparingly. And our zombies are quite chatty, they don’t just walk around saying ‘brains’,' he told news.com.au.

'We’ve kind of subverted the genre. The fun in this is having the opportunity to bring back characters who’ve been killed off.'
