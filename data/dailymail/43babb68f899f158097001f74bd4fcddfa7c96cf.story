A magician has spent the past 12 months creating a balloon model every day - honouring some of key events of 2013 in the process.

From a blow-up Prince George, an inflatable turkey dinner and even a Tardis for the Doctor Who anniversary, 'Robbie the Wizard' has spent hours honouring some key events of last year with the amazing models.

Other
 figures in the magician's 365-strong collection include an evil-looking witch, 
several Mr Men characters, numerous animals including a duck, scorpion 
and a monkey, plus Dennis the Menace.

Film characters including James Bond and Gru from Despicable Me have also been created by the magician, whose real name is Rob Driscoll.

He even made a full-size inflatable bike for one of his more challenging creations.

The
 magician and entertainer decided to embark on his challenge as a New 
Year's Resolution to improve his balloon-modelling skills.

Mr Driscoll creates the balloons at home before giving them away to children at parties or to his young family members.

The 39-year-old entertainer said: 'I like setting myself challenges and thought this would be a good one.

'I have been balloon modelling for years - but wanted to push myself and learn new skills.

'It was kind of a New Year's Resolution and kind of a continuing thing that I do.

'In previous years I have took a self portrait every day and in others, a photograph every day. It's just something I do.''

'I wanted to do something new and as a magician, balloon modelling is something which is very popular.

'I have learnt more about balloon modelling in the last year than I have the past 20 years in magic.

'I am always asking for suggestions and getting requests.

'I give the models away at my magic 
shows, to children who live in my area or my nieces and nephews. The 
balloons never go to waste.'

'It has been challenging but everyone has loved it.

'The children are delighted to have their favourite characters made out of balloons and I am happy to improve my skill as a performer.

'I am constantly look for inspiration for new ideas and techniques.

'My ability has improved so much and it has been such a worthwhile challenge to be able to give the balloons to so many children.'
