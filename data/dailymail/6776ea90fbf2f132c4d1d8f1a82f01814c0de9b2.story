A heartbroken mother who lost two sons in the Peshawar school massacre has described the horrifying moment she was forced to identify one of her boys from a minor cut he suffered on his finger.

As new images emerged of the pupils just days before the attack, Laleena Ali Shah described how she recognised the body of her 'gentle' son Hassnain lying in a pool of blood outside the school thanks only to a plaster on one of his fingers. Her second son Abdullah was found dead and covered in blood nearby.

'It was very sorry state when we were searching for his body...I recognized him from his finger,' she said. 'The bodies were dumped literally in pools of blood. So recognition...was very difficult,' Mrs Ali Shah added.

Last Tuesday 132 innocent children and 13 members of school staff were slaughtered when depraved Taliban gunmen stormed the school in the north west Pakistani city with assault rifles and grenades, before their 'handlers' ordered them to detonate their suicide vests.

The majority of the victims, which included children as young as five, were shot at point blank range in the head or neck - with members of the Pakistani Taliban claiming responsibility for the atrocity and warning the country's army that it was 'just the trailer' for similar attacks in the future.

Yesterday Pakistan said it will execute around 500 militants in the coming weeks after lifting  a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases following last week's school massacre.

Grief: School principal Tahira Qazi, who was killed shepherding children to safety, was pictured just days before the tragedy with Brigadier Asad and sports teacher Javed who also died in the incident

Describing the morning of the attack, Mrs Ali Shah said her son Hassnain had cut his finger when his father Afzak reluctantly allowed the young boy to kill a chicken for the family's dinner.

Wearing a plaster over his wound, Hassnain and his brother Abdullah were then taken 300 yards down the road to their Army-run school in Peshawar where their mother thought they would be safe.

Just hours later the two young boys and 130 of their schoolmates fell victim to the six Taliban gunmen who stormed the school with assault rifles and grenades, firing the weapons indiscriminately in act they claimed was to prevent the children becoming soldiers in the future. 

'The bodies were dumped literally in pools of blood,' Mrs Ali Shah said. 'Recognition of the bodies - 90 per cent of which had been shot at point blank range in the neck and throat - was very difficult.'

'I have lost my two sons, Abdullah and Hassnain. Both were gentle boys. They always come and kissed me before they go to school. I have lost both of them,' she added, holding a third son, just 25 days old - on her lap.

She does so upon the advice of her female relatives who say the presence of the newborn is the only thing that succeeds in calming Mrs Ali Shah down.

Horror: Young men are photographed at a school sports event just days before the Peshawar massacre

Mrs Ali Shah spoke as heartbreaking new photographs emerged of teachers and pupils - including Hassnain - smiling in joy at an army school sports event just days before the massacre.

Young children were pictured being handed medals and awards, while others are seen making the peace sign as they with posing with footballs and cricket bats in jovial scenes.

Just days later, Hassnain and Abdullah Ali Shah's father Afzak was unable to speak for several hours after the true horror of the school massacre sunk in.

Such is the proximity of the family home to the school, that every burst of gunfire and every suicide vest explosion could be heard during the nine hour siege, but relatives were unable to offer to help as the area was sealed of by the army and security services.

The horror of hearing the massacre take place and knowing your child is involved is unimaginable. 

Three days after the massacre the family held a feast in celebration of their sons' lives, inviting relatives and local poor people to enjoy the food in memory of Hassnain and  Abdullah.

Heartbreaking: Details of the feast came as another mother, Sumaira Mahfooz, told MailOnline how she too lost a son in the massacre. Academically gifted Ahmad Mahfooz (right holding books) had progressed at an astonishing rate since joining the school, with excellent handwriting in both English and Urdu

Details of the feast came as another mother, Sumaira Mahfooz, told MailOnline how she too lost a son in the massacre.

Academically gifted Ahmad Mahfooz had progressed at an astonishing rate since joining the school, with excellent handwriting in both English and Urdu. 

His skill was such that his fellow pupils would call him every evening for help with their mathematics homework, and his teachers only ever gave him excellent grades on parents' evening.

On the day of his death the young boy awoke and recited the Koran as usual. When Mrs Mahfooz came to ask him to fetch milk and bread from the nearby market, Ahmad politely asked her not to interrupt him in future while he is reading the religious text.

Just hours later he was dead.

'It was so tragic when I visited the Combined Military Hospital and checked the injured list. The male nurse showed me the list and I told him there was nobody there by the name of Ahmad,' Mrs Mahfooz said.

'Then he asked me whether I wanted to check the list of martyrs [those killed by the Taliban gunmen]. With a heavy heart I told him to show me the list,' she added.

'It was the hardest moment of my life. The male nurse was reading the names of the martyrs and with each name my heart was sinking. At last Ahmad's name was called,' she went on to say.

In disguise: The photographs show the six heavily armed men wearing both traditional clothing of Taliban fighters and the Pakistan military uniforms they wore to avoid suspicion before storming the school 

Killers: Photographs of the six men responsible for murdering 132 children were released by the Taliban along with an emailed statement revealing the terrorists plan more attacks at schools in Pakistan

Militants: All six  gunmen were shot dead by Pakistan security officials - but not until they'd killed 132 children

Armed: Released by the terror group's spokesman Mohammad Khurasani a third group shot shows the same men wearing full military fatigues - an outfit that would outed them as Taliban to security guards

Ahmad Mahfooz was well-known in Peshawar, where his academic skills made him popular with other children.

He too was photographed enjoying himself on the recent school sports day.

Mazhar Hussain, a neighbour, told MailOnline: 'Ahmad was a very nice boy. On the day of the carnage when I went to mosque for evening prayer. The prayer leader was crying and he told me that Ahmad was killed in the school carnage.' 

'He was very attached with neighbours and relatives. All of them liked him a lot. He was a regular visitor of the local mosque and came to every prayer. He used to come 15 minutes earlier to pray,' she added. 

Following his tragic death, Ahmad's mother vowed never to send another child to school.

'I found myself in my home, lying on the bed when everyone was crying... I lost my brilliant son. I will never let my other children to go for education to schools. For me now, life is more important then education,' Mrs Mahfooz said.
