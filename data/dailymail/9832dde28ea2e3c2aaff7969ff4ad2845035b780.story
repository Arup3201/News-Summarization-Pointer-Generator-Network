It is a tragic postscript to her death, penned by a teenage Peaches Geldof frightened she would overdose on heroin just like her mother.

Aged only 19, sitting in troubled singer Pete Doherty’s Camden  flat – a notorious drug den frequented by a string of celebrities – she wrote nine simple words: ‘I solemnly swear I am not going  to die.’

In the end, it was a promise she could never keep.

Peaches' haunting words have emerged in a newly published diary by notorious drug-taker Pete Doherty

Chillingly, the Kindle version includes a photograph of a page in his diary showing Peaches' name and mobile  phone number written in her own blood with a syringe

An inquest heard last week that 25-year-old Peaches died of a drugs overdose ten times bigger than the one that killed her mother, Paula Yates.

Worse still, her 11-month-old son was said to have been alone with her body for up to 17 hours.

As many as 80 syringes, stashes of heroin and burned spoons were found in the young mother’s £1 million country home in Kent, the inquest heard.

Peaches’ haunting words have emerged in a newly published diary by notorious drug-taker Doherty.  The book, From Albion To Shangri-la, charts the musician’s life from 2008 to 2013, and includes more than 200 pages of his drug-induced writings.

Chillingly, the Kindle version includes a photograph of a page in his diary showing Peaches’ name and mobile  phone number written in her own blood with a syringe. Publishers were unable to confirm whether it was written by Doherty or Peaches herself, although the musician has previously exhibited paintings drawn in his own blood.

The diary revelation offers a dark insight into Peaches’ life and her early spiralling drug addiction. The entry was penned in 2008, before she married and had children.

She was already publicly battling with addiction after reportedly overdosing on a night out.

Above Peaches’ promise in the diary, Doherty wrote: ‘Conditions of doing as she would do with her “pleasuring” ting a ting a written oath not to die.’

According to publishers, this is apparently a coded reference to her fears about taking heroin.

Nina Antonia, the author who edited the 
book, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If you look at Peter’s reference to 
Peaches – it is written in Peter  “speak” – “Conditions of doing as  she
 would with her pleasuring ting a ting” translates to “if you are going 
 to continue using drugs please can  you make a promise to be careful?”.
 Hence her response, “I solemnly swear not to…”

‘In his own way, he is asking her to be cautious, but at the same time he couldn’t act like a drug counsellor or he would have been hypocritical. You can’t damn him for attempting to reach out to a friend.’

The diary is littered with references to other celebrity friends, including Liam Gallagher’s ex-girlfriend – and the mother of Doherty’s own son – Lisa Moorish, and has an entry written by the late singer Amy Winehouse.

‘Peter is in the habit of leaving his journals open for friends and visitors to add their own entries,’ said Nina.

The publishers, Thin Man Press, rejected suggestions that by including the picture of Peaches’ blood-scrawled name and number, and her promise not to die, it was glamorising drug-taking. Susan de Muth, managing editor of the publishing house, said: ‘It does the opposite. Nina Antonia worked part-time in the substance misuse field for almost a decade so she understands the turbulent journey from addiction to recovery.

‘Some make it, some don’t, others struggle for years before finally breaking free. Peter has been very brave in writing about the toll that drugs have taken on him.’

Nina added: ‘I’m not in a position to speak for Peter, only about the work that I edited. But I do know Peter was both shocked and saddened by Peaches’ death and the terrible correlation and synchronicity of events.

‘Addiction is one long, drawn out scream for help.

‘The addict can be given all the love in the world if they are fortunate, but until they are able to come to terms with their own inner pain, they will continue to self-medicate.’

When asked if Peaches’ words should have been removed to avoid offence to the Geldof family, her husband and children, Nina replied: ‘Who am I to censor Peter’s work? That would be creative vandalism.’

When The Mail on Sunday contacted Doherty’s agent about Peaches’ diary entry, he refused to comment, other than to say ‘it was a very small part of a very big book’.

Family tragedy: Peaches posted this photograph of her and her mother Paula Yates hours before her death

Peaches was found dead in her home in April by her  23-year-old husband, musician  Thomas Cohen.

Returning from a weekend away, he found her slumped on a bed, her lifeless body covered in needle marks. The couple’s son, Phaedra, who she had been looking after, was also in the house.

Next to the mother-of-two’s body was a sweet box containing a used syringe, with a pair of knotted tights, apparently used as a tourniquet, the inquest heard.

Mr Cohen told the hearing that  the young mother, who had been battling to stay clean from drugs, had relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft.

After his daughter's death, Peaches' father, musician and anti-poverty campaigner Bob Geldof, released a statement saying the family was 'beyond pain'. Peaches is pictured in 2012

Supplies found in the house by police were 61 per cent pure, more than twice the level of purity of commonly traded street heroin.

Tragically, just a few hours before her death, Peaches had posted a  picture of herself and her mother  on Instagram, with the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ The TV presenter died of a heroin overdose when Peaches was 11.

After his daughter’s death, Peaches’ father, musician and anti-poverty campaigner Bob Geldof, released a statement saying the family was ‘beyond pain’.

‘She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us,’ it read. ‘How is this possible that we will not see her again? How is that bearable?

‘We loved her and will cherish her forever. How sad that sentence is.’

Peaches’ entry in Doherty’s new diaries comes as the rock star father-of-two forges a new life for himself in Paris. Earlier this month the singer visited London to take part in a book-signing. On a Facebook page set up to promote the book, fans’ praise comes from as far away as Australia and Brazil.

He has also recently reformed with his old band, The Libertines, playing in front of a sell-out 60,000 crowd at London’s Hyde Park  earlier this month.

In September, the band will  start its first tour of mainland Europe since 2004, playing dates in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin and Dusseldorf.

As Doherty rebuilds his life after years of drug abuse and a very  public on-off romance with model Kate Moss, Peaches’ family is left  still coming to terms with her sudden death.

Seeing her poignant words published in Doherty’s book will surely bring those emotions flooding back.
