A European Commissioner today launched a devastating attack on David Cameron’s plans to curb benefits for migrants, accusing the Prime Minister of not telling the truth and fuelling ‘hysteria’.

Hungarian Laszlo Andor claimed action to deter foreign benefits claimants risked presenting the UK as a ‘nasty country’ and could be the start of the ‘slippery slope’ towards the collapse of the single market.

The European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion boasted that massive immigration from Poland had 'did not cause damage' to Britain but actually helped the economy to grow.

The extraordinary remarks by a senior Brussels official directly attacking the British Prime Minister is likely to fuel growing public anger at the rules imposed by the EU on border controls.

So we would need a more accurate presentation of the reality not under pressure, not under such hysteria which sometimes happens in this case.

Mr Cameron today insisted he understood the public’s concerns, and unveiled a package of measures to restrict access to benefits for EU migrants.

Ahead of the lifting of controls on newcomers from Romania and Bulgaria on January 1, he will declare that the founding EU principle of ‘free movement’ for workers has gone too far.

EU jobseekers will no longer be paid housing benefit to subsidise accommodation costs, there will be time limits before out-of-work benefits can be claimed and migrants who currently get jobseekers’ allowance after less than a month will have to wait three months before claiming.

When Laszlo Andor was handed the plum job as European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion in 2009, even parties in his native Hungary said he was ill-suited to the role.

The economist himself admitted: 'Everyone says I'm an unusual choice.'

Fluent in English and Russian, he studied at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences and was an active member of the economic section of the Hungarian Socialist party from 1998 to 2005.

In 2009 he was forced to deny being a member of the Communist Party.

He earns £212,000-a-year, and has been described as 'probably the most left-wing of the EU's 28 commissioners'.

He once launched a defence of the Soviet Bloc in The Guardian.

In an attempt to play down tensions with the UK last month, his spokesman insisted he once lived in London and Manchester, and likes Kent-brewed ale.

Benefits will be stopped after six months, beggars and vagrants from EU countries will be removed and barred from re-entering Britain for 12 months and a new ‘minimum earnings threshold’ will be set below which benefits that top up earnings, such as income support, will be cut altogether.

But Mr Andor tore into Mr Cameron’s plans, accusing the Prime Minister of not giving the British public the truth about immigration.

‘This is an unfortunate over-reaction. We have been in dialogue with the British authorities, government offices, in recent years.

‘We always encourage a fact-based debate about the current movements of workers and the implications,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘So we would need a more accurate presentation of the reality not under pressure, not under such hysteria which sometimes happens in this case.’

He went on: ‘Unilateral action… is not really helpful because it risks presenting as a kind of nasty country in the European Union.

‘We don’t want that. I think there are much better ways and we have to look into the situation collectively and if there are real problems we act proportionally and not in such a way.’

Mr Andor insisted the issue was not ‘immigration’ but ‘the free movement of workers which applies to every EU member state’.

He said the current rules had been drawn up by all EU member states, including the UK.

In a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Cameron’s pledge to return the orginal purpose of the EU as a trading bloc, Mr Landor added: ‘It is part of the single market which the UK appreciates so much in the European Union.’

He went on: ‘If we start to dismantle some of the rules of the single market which should apply to everyone of course others may invent other idea… and then we end up on the slippery slope. And that is something that nobody really wants.

‘The point is that the British has not been given all the truth and the full truth about this subject.’

David Cameron unveiled sweeping new restrictions on access to benefits for EU migrants

He complained that an article by Mr Cameron today drew a link between EU enlargement and the number of migrants.

‘Well we know that about two thirds of the migrants who go to the United Kingdom from non-European countries.

‘And also if you look at the current movement, much more people moving from for example Italy and Spain than from Romania and Bulgaria.’

He added that there are existing EU rules and safeguards against ‘so-called benefit tourism’.

‘For
example jobseekers allowance: if someone newly arrives to the UK or 
another country it is the home country which in the first place needs to
cover if necessary jobseekers and not the receiving country.’

But Downing Street rejected the accusations from the £212,000-a-year Eurocrat. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'As the Prime Minister was saying in his article, we are not the only country to see free movement as a qualified right. I think it is very important to be clear about the measures that the Government is taking.'

The spokesman told a daily Westminster media briefing that the PM was "of course" confident of the legal basis for his proposals. Pressed over whether he would go ahead with their implementation regardless of the response from Brussels, the spokesman said: 'This is what we are going to do.'

There has been growing anxiety about the impact of restrictions on Romanians and Bulagrians being lifted in January.

There are fears of a repeat of 2004 when Labour opened up the borders to eight Eastern European countries – including Poland.

Then, officials predicted just 13,000 migrants a year would come but more than a million have arrived.

Mr Andor said: ‘It is true that migration from countries like Poland in the last decade was higher.’

Pressed
by Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys that the figures was ‘massively 
higher’, Mr Andor added: ‘It was massively higher but it did not cause 
damage. It actually contributed to the growth of the British economy.

‘I think if there are real problems we have to look at those, analyse those together, and if there is any kind of problem we have to reflect together.’

However, Mr Cameron accuses Labour of a ‘monumental mistake’ in failing to control immigration from Eastern Europe.

He said the last government's refusal to impose controls on new EU members in 2004 
led to a surge in immigration. One million people from central and 
Eastern Europe now live in the UK.

‘In
2004, the Labour Government made the decision that the UK should opt 
out completely of transitional controls on the new EU member states.

'They had the right to impose a seven-year ban before new citizens could
come and work here, but – almost alone in Europe – Labour refused it. 
That was a monumental mistake,’ Mr Cameron writes in an article for the 
Financial Times today.

He said ‘That was the moment to address difficult questions about when
to allow new entrants full access to each others’ labour markets – but 
the Labour Government ducked these questions.’

But Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mr Cameron of 'playing catch up'.

She aded: 'Why has it taken him eight months to copy Labour's proposal to make the Habitual Residence Test stronger and clearer?

'After Labour proposed this change in March, the Government said it was all fine and nothing needed to change. Yet now, rather than following a coherent plan, they are flailing around. No wonder public confidence in the Government's handling of this issue has collapsed.

'This change was only one of Labour's proposals. The Government should also be beefing up enforcement of dodgy gangmasters and targeting sectors that are reliant on migrant labour to ensure they are working to train employees.'

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'UKIP has driven the agenda in terms of warning of the dangers of opening up our doors to EU nations like Bulgaria and Romania next year and now we see Cameron and Clegg trying to recover from the UKIP surge.

'These measures fall way short of what the British public want though. Our borders will remain open. Migrants will still be entitled to out of work benefits after just three months. It isn’t nearly good enough.'
