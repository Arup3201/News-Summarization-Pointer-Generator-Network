A millionaire property investor has been slapped with one of the biggest ever fines for unlawful renovations - after building TWO conservatories on his £4 million Listed house.

Maurice Lawee, 59, caused 'irreversible damage' to his multi-million pound Grade-II listed home with a pair of extensions.

Mr Lawee knocked out chimney breasts, the original staircase, alcoves, and doors and damaged the Flemish bond brickwork - a style of patterned masonry. Barnet Council have now initiated proceedings to order the company director to demolish the two conservatories and replace the bay windows. 

Mr Lawee purchased the property in 2008 which had its historic bay windows, pictured  

Maurice Lawee was fined £45,000 over the construction of the two extensions at the rear of his house

Mr Lawee was also ordered to cover the council's legal costs which amounted to £14,000 after his guilty plea

The unauthorised work on the historic building included removing original features and building two huge conservatories on the back.

Mr Lawee has a one-quarter share in Casehill Limited which has current assets of more than £2.1 million according to the most recent company accounts.

The company owes almost £142,000 although it reported a profit in 2013 of more than £600,000. 

Mr Lawee began the building works under the premise of creating an 'iceberg-home'-style basement extension.

Barnet Council granted him permission to build an extension to his basement with the installation of a lift, and a garage conversion.

But he ignored repeated pleas from the local council to stop the unauthorised work, and was eventually fined almost £60,000 for the illegal work.

Barnet Council confimed that Mr Lawee will have to restore the exterior of his house to its original state

A Barnet Council spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Lawee would be ordered to demolish the conservatories.

She said: 'Barnet Council has confirmed they are taking steps against Mr Lawee to remove the harmful works, which includes the two conservatory bays.'

Mr Lawee ignored the advice of planning officials who told him to stop building the twin extensions

Mr Lawee bought the six-bedroom mock Tudor home, which was built in 1912, for £3.7 million in 2008, in the historic Hampstead Garden Suburb Conservation area, in Hampstead, north west London.

He was fined £45,000, the third-highest fine issued by magistrates in England for the offence, and ordered to pay the council's £14,000 legal fees at Willesden Magistrates'Court.

Barnet Council's leader, Councillor Richard Cornelius, said: 'Mr Lawee showed a blatant disregard for the fact he was living in a conservation area in a Grade-II listed building when he decided to alter his house in the way he chose fit.

'Planning laws are there for a reason and the high level of fine reflects the seriousness of this breach.'

Building to the home designed by architect George Lister Sutcliffe in the exclusive garden suburb requires approval from the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, even for building a garden shed.

The trust made numerous complaints to the council that Lawee was carrying out unapproved work to the property, which has three bathrooms and three receptions and was listed for conservation in 1996.

Lawee and his architect assured conservation officers that he would cease unauthorised work when they visited the luxury property but he continued his renovations.

A spokesman for Barnet Council's solicitor, HB Public Law, said: 'Officers gave repeated warnings that work must stop.

'Despite on occasions promises being made for this to happen, works continued regardless, stripping out much of the interior of the house, changing the proportions and the spaces, partially demolishing the outhouses and building.

'Irreversible damage has been caused to the brickwork and outhouse and original features appear to have been destroyed or removed from the building.'

Mr Lawee admitted four offences of carrying out unauthorised work.

David Davidson, architectural adviser for the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, said: 'The Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust is very pleased that the Court has taken these offences seriously and imposed such a substantial fine on the building owner.

'The Suburb is an area of international significance in the history of town planning and architecture, and alterations to its buildings need to be carefully considered in order to retain its special characteristics.

'Mr Lawee chose to ignore the planning regulations which exist to protect Listed Buildings from damaging alterations.' 

Lawee has gained retrospective approval from the council for some of the changes but may be ordered to demolish the rest of his renovations.

He applied for planning permission for some of his renovations only after he had begun construction and Barnet later approved four of the changes.

Despite gaining retrospective permission, Lawee still must pay the fine because he did not get approval before he carried out the work.

Mr Lawee successfully applied for retrospective planning permission for several of his alterations 

Council officials have told Mr Lawee that he must demolish the unauthorised conservatories 

But he is appealing over several refusals including the he had built and Barnet may order for them to be destroyed if he loses his appeal.

Lawee will have to pull down the two large conservatories built at the back of his property following the magistrates' ruling on Tuesday last week.

The community in the leafy suburb is divided as to whether he should be allowed to carry out his desired renovations.

A neighbour said: 'I don't see what the problem is. People spend a lot of hard earned money on their properties. Who are we to tell him what to do with his house?

"It's his house, why is it our business what he does to it?

'There's a division in the area between the old-school suburban people and the new money coming in. Actually, I think the old school need to relax a bit.'

One neighbourhood stalwart, who has lived there for more than 30 years, believes Lawee should be forced to convert the property back to its original state.

He said: 'With all due respect, you get people coming here who a £45,000 fine would be cheap.

'There are Russian oligarchs and rich Arabs moving to the area who could happily pay that fine in order to build whatever they want.

'Rather than a fine they should just be ordered to convert the property back to how it is.'

Lawee is yet to respond to request for comment.
