The policeman who arrested Mel Gibson for suspected drink-driving has blasted Gary Oldman for accusing him of making anti-Semitic comments and racist remarks about African-Americans.

In the now infamous Playboy interview in which Gary Oldman said 'political correctness was c**p', the actor also he doubted whether the arresting officer had never used a racist term.

Gibson, 58, made anti-Jewish slurs when he was arrested in 2006 in Malibu, two years after his film The Passion Of The Christ was criticised for depicting Jews negatively.

And in the interview which is out later this month Oldman sided with Gibson saying: 'We're all f**king hypocrites. That's what I think about it. The policeman who arrested him has never used the word n****r or that f**king Jew?" '

The comments have angered James Mee, the officer who arrested Gibson, and he has hit back telling TMZ: 'I'm Jewish and why would I say that to discredit my own religious makeup?'

'The N-word is a scary word.  I would never even dream of using it.  It sickens me that anyone would use that word.'

'Jews have been persecuted and put down over the years. Why would I, as a Jew, do that to other races?'

Notorious: Mel Gibson has been an Hollywood outcast since his infamous drink-driving arrest in Malibu in 2006

According
 to the police report, Gibson made anti-Semitic remarks to the  saying: 'F****** Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the 
wars in the world.'

He has since apologised for his 'despicable' behavior, explaining that the comments were 'blurted out in a moment of insanity'.

He was sentenced to three years probation and entered a rehab programme as well as attending self help meetings for alcoholics.

In the wide-ranging interview in Playboy's July/August double issue out on Friday that covers Oldman's 'wild nights' with groupies and his four 
marriages, the actor - whose new movie Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is
 out next month - says: 'I don't know about Mel. He got drunk and said a
 few things, but we've all said those things.

'Mel
 Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews and he said the wrong thing 
because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him - and 
doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough.

'He’s like an outcast, a leper, you know?

'But
 some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn’t turned and said, “That 
f***ing kraut” or “F*** those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and 
try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me.'

'We all hide and try to be so politically correct. 

That’s what gets me. It’s just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone, that we all stand on this thing going, “Isn’t that shocking?”'

After
 then jokingly saying, 'f*** the Pope,' the True Romance actor admitted 
the interview had taken a fateful turn, and insisted he was not 'a 
bigot.'

Working
 class Londoner Oldman, who is the son of a welder, said: 'No, but I’m defending 
all the wrong people. I’m saying Mel’s all right.'

Following news of his comments yesterday Oldman issued a grovelling apology.

Oldman's controversial interview has derailed his tour promoting Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes

After he was attacked over his choice
 of words by the Anti-Defamation League, he issued his fawning apology, 
in which he hailed Jews as 'the chosen people.'

The 56-year-old insisted he is a huge admirer of the contribution Jewish people have made to showbusiness.

He in a statement: 
'If, during the interview, I had been asked to elaborate on this point I
 would have pointed out that I had just finished reading Neal Gabler’s 
superb book about the Jews and Hollywood, An Empire of Their Own: How 
the Jews invented Hollywood.

'The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution.

'I hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt, genuine, and that I
 have an enormous personal affinity for the Jewish people in general, 
and those specifically in my life.'

He
 then finished by begging for forgiveness, going as far as to say he is 
unworthy of using a Hebrew greeting meaning 'peace be upon you.'
