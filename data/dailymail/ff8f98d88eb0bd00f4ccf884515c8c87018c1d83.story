Around 100 solar panels have been stolen during two separate overnight raids on a massive eco-friendly power farm near Derbyshire.

The criminals managed to sneak past security guards who carry out 24-hour patrols on the 112-acre site near Sudbury.

Police say the gang would have needed at least one vehicle to transport the panels which measure 2ft by 3ft each.

Stolen: Thieves stole around 100 solar panels from a massive site at Aston House Farm near Derbyshire

Theft: They stole 11 panels the first night and 84 the next at the 112-acre solar farm being constructed by Solarcentury

Between 6pm on Tuesday, March 3 and 7am the next morning, thieves went into the Aston House Farm fields and stole 14 panels.

And another 84 panels were stolen from another site on the same road between 6pm on Friday, February 27 and 11.30am the next morning. 

Once the stolen panels are replaced and the solar farm being constructed by Solarcentury is switched on, the 20 megawatts of energy it generates will be enough to power 5,500 homes.

A spokesman for Derbyshire police said a sit-on roller was stolen from a third site also on Lichfield Road between 6pm on Tuesday, January 13 and 7am the following day.

He added: 'We want to hear from anyone who may have seen suspicious vehicles or people in the area around the times of the offences.' 

Eco-friendly: Once the panels are replaced and the 20 megawatt farm is switched on, it will generate enough electricity to power 5,500 homes

Robbery: Police say the gang would have needed at least one vehicle to transport the panels which measure 2ft by 3ft each
