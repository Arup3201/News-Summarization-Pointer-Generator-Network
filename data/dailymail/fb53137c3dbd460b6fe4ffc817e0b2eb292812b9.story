In a terrifying abduction attempt a Sydney nurse has fought off a stranger who tried to drag her into the boot of his car.

The 28-year-old nurse was walking along Falcon Street after finishing a late shift at North Shore Private Hospital when a silver BMW pulled up and a man jumped from the car. He grabbed the nurse, put his hand over her mouth and tried to drag her into the boot of the car.

It was only after the nurse hit the man in the groin that he released his grip and she was able to make her escape. The nurse luckily only suffered cuts and bruises, although badly shaken by the incident.

CCTV footage shows the nurse in her uniform strolling down a busy Sydney road late on Wednesday night

Police said that the car was a silver BMW driven by a man of Middle Eastern or Indian descent 

Police described the man as Middle Eastern or Indian, aged in his 30s and about 175cm tall with a stocky build.

CCTV footage showed the nurse in her uniform strolling down a busy Sydney road late on Wednesday night. She follows the Pacific Highway bend at Crows Nest and turns onto Falcon St.

After the attack the man is last seen at about 10.25pm driving up Sophia Street, a narrow one-way lane lined with houses.

Residents said they heard the woman scream before she ran to a nearby Caltex station where the attendant tried to calm her down until police arrived minutes later.

Officers took footage from cameras at businesses on Crows Nest's main drag, including some showing the nurse walking on her own

Detectives have collected CCTV footage from the station, believed to show the traumatised woman running inside.

Officers also took footage from cameras at businesses on Crows Nest's main drag, including some showing the nurse walking on her own.

Superintendent Allan Sicard says every detective in his local command is on the case and the Sex Crimes Squad is involved.

Supt Sicard said getting kicked in the groin must have left this man in pain and anyone he might have gone home to might have noticed.

The terrified nurse ran to a nearby petrol station and contacted police

‘Someone will know this man,’ he said.

‘He might have come to someone's house, someone's unit, someone's social group, been in a degree of pain, anxious or maybe sweating.’

He said the attack was extremely out of character for the lower north shore area and asked the public not to let the fear of crime rule their lives.

In wake of the attack, the hospital has advised staff to avoid walking home alone in the dark.
