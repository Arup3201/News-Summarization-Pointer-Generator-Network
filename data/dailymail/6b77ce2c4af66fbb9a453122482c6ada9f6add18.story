Jamie Oliver has re-ignited his feud with fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay by accusing him of being 'deeply jealous' of his success.

The 39-year-old hit out at his Scottish rival after Ramsay criticised him for not attending the opening of his new restaurant - Jamie's Italian - in Hong Kong.

Ramsay, 48, who previously opened his own Bread Street Kitchen in the Asian city, said Oliver could have 'at least turned up' to unveil his new eatery.

Oliver responded to the comments during a visit to open a new restaurant in Sydney, Australia, this week by claiming Ramsay was simply jealous.

He said: 'Gordon will do anything to try and take the p**s out of me because he is deeply jealous and can't quite work out why I do what I do and why he can't do that.

'He is too busy shouting and screaming and making our industry look like a bunch of shouters and screamers.'

Oliver and his wife Jules have seen their fortune leap £90million to in excess of £240million with their restaurant chains, TV appearances and her childrenswear range.

Meanwhile Ramsay's fortune is said to be valued at more than £100million with his worldwide chain of restaurants.

The pair have often made snide comments at each other, and it didn't stop this week when Oliver continued to criticise his rival over their books.

Oliver's 15th book, Save With Jamie, shot to the top of the UK bestsellers list upon its release, bringing his total number of book sales to just over 37million.

In contrast, Ramsay has released 21 titles which have sold an estimate three million copies in total.

Oliver said: 'I think that really, really annoys him.

'Book sales are about having a deep trusted relationship with the public. I really write my books. I don't just turn up for the front cover. I write every word, every letter and I oversee every bit of design.

'You can sell a few books by luck or a moment ... but not 15 years and 37million books. That's not luck.'

The two celebrity chefs - who both have four children - have previously clashed over their differing styles.

In 2010, while on a promotional tour of Canada, Ramsay said Oliver was 'just a cook' while he proclaimed himself to be 'a chef'.

A year earlier, he admitted he was not a fan of Oliver, describing him as a 'one-pot wonder.'

He said: 'Everything kind of gets mixed in - hands in. It's a very different style to me. He sticks it in the oven, comes back three hours later and it's done.

Chefs Oliver and Ramsay (pictured together in 2006) have often exchanged fraught words over the years

Oliver made the comments during an appearance in Sydney, Australia, to open a new restaurant this week

'We cook differently. I use basic ingredients taken up with a lot more excitement.

'But competition is healthy. It's good to have that kind of rivalry.'

He also asked when he had last complained about a meal and answered: 'Last time I had dinner at Jamie Oliver's restaurant.'

But Oliver has continued to stand his ground, and even praised the wife of Ramsay's wife Tana.

He said: 'If I was to choose between buying Gordon Ramsay's cookbook or Tana Ramsay's, it would be Tana's every time.

'In my opinion, her books are a damn sight better than his.'
