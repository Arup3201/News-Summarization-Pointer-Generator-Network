Doctors ordered a month's rest for Argentina's president on Saturday after they found blood on her brain due to a head injury.

President Cristina Fernandez's spokesman said she had suffered a previously undisclosed 'skull trauma' on August 12. No details about this injury were officially released Saturday night.

Spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro read a statement signed by the president's doctors saying they did a CAT scan of her brain after the August head injury and found nothing wrong, and that afterward she suffered no symptoms.

But he said problems surfaced Saturday after Fernandez, 60, went to a 
hospital for checks on an irregular heartbeat. Because she was suffering
headaches, they looked at her skull again, too, and found a subdural 
hematoma.

That means bleeding between the brain and the skull. The 
statement defined it as "chronic" and not 'acute,' which suggests that 
it has been slowly building.

'The president had a cardiovascular study done in the Fundacion Favaloro
and given that she had head pain, they did neurological studies, 
diagnosing a "chronic subdural collection" (bleeding on the brain), and 
they ordered her to rest for a month,' said the statement, which was 
signed by the president's doctors. The statement added that her doctors 
will keep close watch on how the bleeding evolves using imaging 
technology.

According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the symptoms of 
chronic subdural collections usually do not heal by themselves and often
require surgery that involves drilling small holes in the skull to 
drain the liquid, relieving pressure and to reduce or prevent brain 
damage.

Her spokesman did not address during his televised announcement whether 
Fernandez will try to keep managing the country herself from the 
presidential residence, or formally take medical leave and hand the 
government over to Vice President Amado Boudou, who was flying back to 
Argentina from Brazil Saturday night.

It's a hard time for Fernandez, a tireless campaigner, to disappear from
Argentina's political scene.

August 12 was one day after primary 
elections in which her opponents made significant gains. With the latest
doctors' orders, she won't be able to campaign for her allies ahead of 
key congressional midterm elections on October 27 that will determine 
whether the ruling Front for Victory party holds onto enough seats to 
enable her to continue ruling with virtually unchecked power.

In January of 2012, Fernandez had her thyroid glands removed fearing 
that they were cancerous, but tests later showed no presence of 
cancerous cells. She also suffers from chronic hypertension, and has 
periodically had to take several days rest.
