I've been lucky enough to have travelled quite a lot in the Caribbean, thanks to stints as a reporter for various TV holiday shows, including Wish You Were Here...? and Rough Guide.

On one of my first reporting trips, I flew to Mustique and sailed through the islands on an 80ft monohull boat.

There's something magical about the Caribbean: being in a boat, pootling around and getting from one island to the next gives you a real sense of adventure.

But now that I have a baby son, Zephyr, my adventuring days are over for a while. And for my latest holiday I was looking for relaxation.

So in St Lucia, we stayed first at the Cap Maison Hotel, a lovely resort with a very friendly atmosphere. Its great facilities made it perfect for a family break.

Just glorious: Ladera sits on the south-west shore of St Lucia, within sight of the famous pitons

Then we visited the Ladera Hotel, which is situated in a World Heritage Site overlooking the island's famous peaks, the Pitons.

Some of the Ladera's rooms are completely open to the elements. You can feel the wind moving through the rooms in the evening.

Simply sensational: The second part of Julia's holiday took her to the remote enclave of Scrub Island

You sleep in a very comfortable four-poster with a mosquito net - it's impossibly glamorous camping.

And in the morning, you wake up to that extraordinary view.

After St Lucia we headed to Scrub Island, a new private island resort a mile off Tortola, the largest of the British Virgin Islands. It is stunning.

One of our highlights was a day-trip sail to Cooper Island, an eco-resort famous for its scuba-diving.

It brought home to me just what variety you can enjoy in the Caribbean.

On St Lucia, there is so much to do.

If you want to hike, you can hike up the volcanoes; if you want watersports, you can enjoy all sorts.

A week on Scrub Island, however, is all about staying put and enjoying the quiet. It was just wonderful being surrounded by that beautiful sea and taking in those views.

I'd become convinced in recent years that the Indian Ocean is the smart place to go these days. I'd forgotten the unique charm of the Caribbean experience.

It just has a special allure and I think it always will have.
