Lord Justice Leveson, the judge who led the inquiry into the culture, ethics and practice of the Press, has been promoted to a senior High Court role.

He is to be President of the Queen’s Bench Division from next month.

The Division handles defamation cases and although he is not expected to hear any cases himself, he will pick the judges who do.

New position: Lord Justice Leveson, the judge who led the inquiry into the culture, ethics and practice of the Press, has been promoted to a senior High Court role

The appointment means Sir Brian Leveson will be involved in further dealings with the Press.

The Queen’s Bench Division previously attracted controversy in a row over judge Sir David Eady, who was responsible for a number of privacy law rulings.

Critics said a single judge had been given too great a share of important cases to hear.

Sir Brian, 64, was a candidate to take over as Lord Chief Justice, but the job went to Sir John Thomas.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
