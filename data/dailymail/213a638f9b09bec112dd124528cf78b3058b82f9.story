Sworn at: Brian Wales felt intimidated when he worked at Jamie Oliver's parents' pub

Jamie Oliver's parents are being sued by a former kitchen porter who claims he was underpaid and regularly sworn at while working at the family’s Essex pub.

Former businessman Brian Wales, 71, claims the chef’s father Trevor was ‘abusive’ and ‘bullied’ him after he discovered that he and 56 other casual workers were owed money.

The claims have surfaced two weeks after Jamie sparked  outrage by claiming British kitchen workers were lazy compared with ‘tougher’ immigrant staff.

Mr Wales took up the part-time, £7-an-hour dishwashing job at The Cricketers in Clavering to subsidise his pension.  All was well until May, when he found he had been underpaid by about half an hour a day.

‘I felt cheated,’ he said. ‘A few pounds here and there might not seem much money to some, but when you are struggling to get by on a pension, every penny counts.’

Pub managers found that 57 staff employed on hourly rates had been underpaid, with the Olivers blaming a faulty machine used to check when staff clocked on and off.

They have since paid out a total of £1,847 to staff, including £40 to Mr Wales.

He said: ‘Sally Oliver thanked me for bringing the issue to her attention so they could rectify it.’

But shortly afterwards, Mr Wales claims he was told by a pastry chef that Trevor Oliver ‘now had it in for him’.

‘One day I got into work and Trevor 
told me to clean the ovens, which wasn’t my job,’ he says, ‘When I said 
so, he told me, “Clean that f****** stove now as you have f*** all to 
do”. I did it, but it was upsetting to be spoken to like that.’

Later that same day, he claims Trevor again swore at him, saying: ‘Why can’t you f****** get out of here by 3pm.’

Mr
Wales says he raised the issue of his ‘bullying’ in a letter to Sally, 
and in June asked Trevor if he could speak with him about his concerns.

He claims he was then told: ‘No, I don’t have the f****** time to talk to you. Either you get on with your work or f*** off.’

He adds: ‘Trevor did eventually calm down and offered an apology for his language but I was still concerned that I was on the wrong side of him .  .  . I did not believe Trevor was genuinely pleased that I raised the payroll issue.’

Mr Wales said he even feared Trevor may become violent towards him, and had no other choice but to resign.

He is now bringing his case to an industrial tribunal, a date for which has yet to be set.

In response, the Olivers say it is ‘accepted that a degree of bad language is relatively commonplace within a kitchen’ but describe Mr Wales’s claims of abuse and bullying as ‘wholly bogus and without foundation... To suggest that there was a campaign directed at Mr Wales is completely refuted.’

In their statement to the tribunal they claim it was clear Mr Wales ‘regarded the work .  .  . as beneath him’.

As a result, they say, Mr Wales ‘seemed prepared to go to great lengths to avoid doing his job’.

And they claim workmates are ‘queuing up’ to give evidence ‘to expose just how  fabricated the claims are’.
