A medical student says she has found a new way to care for people by becoming a beauty queen.

Carina Tyrrell, 24, who is in her fifth year of medicine at Cambridge University's Murray Edwards
College, said winning a place in the Miss England final gives her a chance to 'give something back'.

She said: 'It would mean so much to me to win Miss
 England, as I want to give so much back to the country. Being
 a Miss is not just about physical attributes, you have to be beautiful 
on the inside and have a caring heart too and be well-rounded. Miss 
England is a beautiful ambassador for the country.

'Over the moon': Carina said she was delighted to win the Miss Cambridgeshire crown after competing against 12 other girls

She added: 'I
 am very caring and always try to help people as much as I can. I think 
winning the competition would enable me to help people in a new way.'

Carina, who was crowned Miss Cambridgeshire at the weekend, has been juggling her modelling with her studies and shifts at the city's Addenbrooke's Hospital.

She is also president of the Global 
Health Society at the university, which has just started a project to 
help the homeless in Cambridge.

Stunning looks: But Carina said being a beauty queen isn't just about physical attributes

She said beauty queens have to be 'beautiful on the inside and have a caring heart too'

The beauty queen said she was delighted 
to take the crown of Miss Cambridgeshire, which means she will take part
 in the Miss England final in Torquay in June. The winner will go on to 
represent her country in the Miss World pageant.

'I'm absolutely over the moon. I've always been interested in beauty, modelling and fashion and the Miss England competition is something I have always wanted to do,' Carina said.

'This is the last year I could take part in the contest and Cambridge means so much to me I really want to give something back. Maybe if I can do well in Miss England I will be able to do that.'

She elaborated: 'I think Cambridge has given me so much, from the hospital to the university, that I wanted to try to give something back. My desire to help those in need is very strong and this is reflected in my training to become a doctor.

'As student doctor, you meet new people every day and you are constantly in the public eye. Being comfortable in this setting I believe helps in a beauty contest.'

Next step: Carina will now compete in the Miss England final which will be held in Torquay in June

Carina competed against 12 other 
girls in the Miss Cambridgeshire competition, which she was encouraged 
to enter by family and friends.

She is the only member of her family to go into medicine but has always been interested in fashion and took part in a charity catwalk show when she was at school.

'When I was younger I made a range of dresses and then modelled them at a catwalk show to raise money for charity,' she said.

'In my first three years at university I had to hold back on the modelling as I had so much studying to do, but last year I did some photo shoots and I also won the under 21 category in the Cambridge Model Search competition.'

Next Miss World? The student will have to prepare for a number of rounds including eco-fashion

She will now have to start preparing 
her outfits for the Miss England final, which will see 60 winners from 
across the country compete in a number of rounds including creating 
their own outfit for the eco fashion section and showcasing a talent.

'I'm so looking forward to Miss England - we all have to go to a keep-fit boot camp beforehand so I can't wait to meet all the girls,' she said.

'Most of my fellow doctors are really supportive but a few were a bit perplexed. And my boyfriend is really excited.'

Angie Beasley, director of Miss England, said the fact Miss England is attracting girls of Carina's calibre shows the pageant is not all about just having a pretty face.

She said: 'I'm delighted to say the Miss England competition is attracting a new breed of girls from all walks of life. Our
 message is Beauty with a Purpose - the ethos of Miss World. Carina is 
the first student doctor to reach the final and we think she has a great
 chance of taking the crown in Torquay in June.'
