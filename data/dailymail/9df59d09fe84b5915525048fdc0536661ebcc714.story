A pregnant British woman collapsed and died at a Spanish airport while waiting to return home from a relative's birthday party, it emerged today.

Local sources said the 21-year-old mum-to-be had been celebrating her grandmother's 70th on the sun-kissed Costa Brava with her family days earlier.

The victim, believed to be three or four months pregnant, collapsed while she waited to board a Birmingham-bound flight at Girona airport at 3.24pm on Tuesday afternoon.

Collapse: The 21-year-old, believed to be three to four months pregnant, was at Girona Airport on the north-east Costa Brava waiting to fly back to Birmingham

Witnesses say she had passed through 
the departure gate and was travelling in a lift from the terminal 
building down to the runway level when she reported feeling dizzy.

Moments
later she vomited and collapsed in front of her horrified sister, 
nephew and brother-in-law who desperately tried to revive her.

She
was already dead when medics arrived on the scene and heartbroken 
family members were left to call waiting relatives at Birmingham Airport
to tell them of the tragedy.

They were said to be staying in an airport hotel yesterday as they awaited the release of the woman's body.

Spanish
police said her remains had been taken to the Institute of Legal 
Medicine of Girona where a post-mortem exam would attempt to establish 
the cause of death.

Yesterday,
a workers' union vowed to investigate whether the 14-minute delay in 
medical treatment could have saved the victim's life.

The
Union General de Trabajadores (UGT) said the airport's on-site medical 
centre had been scrapped last year after bosses deemed there was not 
enough demand for a 24-hour service.

Secretary General of Transport Joan Muntada said the organisation would investigate the circumstances surrounding the death.

He said: 'We will analyse events to see if they could lead to charges.'

The
medical centre was closed last July due to a drop in passenger volumes -
but the airport said the 14-minute response time was within expected 
guidelines.

The UK Foreign Office confirmed it was aware of the death but did not release any more details.

A
spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in 
Girona, Spain, and are providing consular assistance to the family.'
