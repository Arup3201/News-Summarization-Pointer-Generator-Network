The police officer who was filmed collapsing after he was shot in the neck was taking on a gunman who had killed his own daughter, it has emerged.

The policeman has now been named as 28-year-old Jarred Slocum who worked in the city of El Cajon, east of San Diego in California.

He is in critical but stable condition after he was filmed clutching his bleeding neck and collapsing after being hit in the stand off with Kevin Collier, 32.

Collier, 32, from San Diego, is suspected of shooting his baby daughter and leaving her body in the trunk of his car shortly before he shot a policeman in the head, critically wounding him.

His body was found inside his house, which he burned down during the standoff, where he is also believed to have shot his mother-in-law Beverly Rakov, 51.

Stand-off: Two cops were responding to a call from neighbours claiming a man was brandishing a gun outside a house in El Cajon, California

Running away: The suspect fired several shots when the officers arrived at the house on Sunday and one (pictured) was hit in the neck

Collier is believed to have texted family and friends on Sunday telling the that he had killed his daughter and mother-in-law, police spokesman Lt Mark Coit said.

The baby was found inside a truck the 32-year-old uses for work
with a gunshot wound to the head, and authorities were trying to 
determine whether the girl was Collier's one-year-old daughter Rhilee.

Investigators are combing the charred
debris of the home in El Cajon, a working-class city east of San Diego.

They have so far found two bodies and are working to identify them.

Search: As firefighters grappled with the blaze, SWAT team officers looked for the gunman

Heather Gooden, a friend of Mrs Rakov, 
told Fox she received a message early on Sunday in which she said 
her son-in-law had guns and she feared for her life.

She said she received a message saying: 'I have never been so scared in my life, Heather. He has guns. He's 
gonna shoot my daughter. He has lost his f***ing mind.'

Mrs Gooden said she sent repeated texts to her friend throughout the day  but got no replies.

The officer Collier shot today, 
Jarred Slocum, 28, remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition
after undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to his forehead that 
fractured his skull.

Officer Slocum and another police officer were responding to a call that a man was brandishing a gun outside a home in El Cajon.

He fired a shot before grabbing hold of his neck and slumping against the fence with blood seeping from the wound.

Minutes later smoke billowed from the
home and firefighters fought to control the blaze with the help of 
helicopters who dumped water overhead.

SWAT team members surrounded the 
property and officials evacuated nearby homes and shut down surrounding 
roads and freeways, unsure whether the gunman had escaped, according to 
Fox.

Scene: Emergency and police vehicles block Prince Street in El Cajon, California as they search for Kevin Collier who is believed to have shot his daughter and mother-in-law

They found the body of a man near the
front of the home who they believe to be Collier but will need dental 
records to confirm because of the condition the body was in.

His wife managed to escape and was safe.

Mrs Gooden, 41, arrived sobbing at 
the police tape cordoning off the homes. She said she has known the 
family for 30 years and never heard of any problems with violence.

She said Mrs Rakov owned the home, 
and her daughter, Alyssa, and her husband and baby daughter had moved in
after a job opportunity for Collier in New York fell through in 
December.

She said she heard the couple had filed for divorce last week.

Before that, she said, she never heard anything negative about Collier and that he appeared to be the perfect husband.

At a recent baby shower, Collier was so affectionate that a family friend commented that they longed for 'a man like that'.

‘I saw about 30 police cars - it was like martial law in the streets. There was black roaring smoke in the sky, it was crazy, it just kept coming up. It was like a movie, it was surreal'

Richard Ogunsalu, who lives nearby, was in the shower when he heard sirens and ran outside to see police everywhere and the house burning.’

‘I saw about 30 police cars - it was like martial law in the streets,’ Mr Ogunsalu said.

‘There was black roaring smoke in the sky, it was crazy, it just kept coming up. It was like a movie, it was surreal.’
