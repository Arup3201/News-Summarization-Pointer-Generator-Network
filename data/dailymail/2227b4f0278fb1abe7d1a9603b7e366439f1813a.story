TV licence offenders would no longer be criminalised under plans from Tory ministers.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling want to water down the penalties for refusing to pay the fee to a civil matter.

It is likely to be part of the upcoming negotiations with the BBC over the renewal of its charter.

Culture secretary Maria Miller and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling are said to be backing plans to water down punishments for people who don't pay their TV licence

Tory sources said it would be a ‘bargaining chip’ and ‘stick’ for the corporation which has been castigated over its governance and transparency failures.

Those who fail to pay their £145.50 licence fee face fines of up to £1,000. Seventy people a year go to prison because they refuse to fork out.

Around 180,000 people last year, or roughly one in nine cases before magistrates, is related to licence fee evasion. Some 155,000 are fined.

Backbench MPs are also separately supporting decriminalisation in the Deregulation Bill, backing an amendment by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. 

Mr Bridgen said that for some cash-strapped families the current law was 'criminalising them for being poor'.

But the BBC is likely to fight the idea because the broadcaster has already faced a real terms funding cut with the fee frozen, and has said further cuts could lead to more programmes being lost.

Currently 180,000 cases for non payment end up before magistrates each year, with 155,000 people fined and 70 sent to prison

Mr Grayling said: ‘The Culture Secretary and I both agree this is a really interesting idea – particularly given the pressure on our courts system. Our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal.

Speaking to The Telegraph, he added: 'It is outrageous that so many people are brought in to the criminal justice system through this means.

'I believe that non payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are.

'It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence.'

He has 101 MPs signed up to the move although the Telegraph quoted a DCMS source suggesting Culture Secretary Maria Miller would prefer to wait for the upcoming negotiations over the review of the BBC's charter.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Changing the law could lead to higher evasion. Just a one per cent increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35million.’
