If you've ever dropped an iPhone you'll know the feeling of panic as it hurtles to the ground and the screen smashes.

But it seems that Apple's MacBook Air is made of much sturdier stuff.

A pilot recently lost his notebook when it slid from a light aircraft he was flying over South Africa. 

And despite falling from an altitude of around 1,000ft (305 metres) the MacBook survived - albeit with superficial damage.

The photos of the bent notebook (pictured) were uploaded to Reddit by the South African pilot, who posts under the username av80r. He said that following the fall, the MacBook was found by a local farmer called 'Malopo' who contacted av80r via Facebook

The photos of the bent notebook, shown switched on and off, were uploaded to Reddit by the pilot who posts under the username av80r.

He said that following the fall, the MacBook was found by a local farmer called Malopo who contacted av80r via Facebook. 

The pilot wrote: 'My laptop fell 1,000ft at 200km/h [125mph]. 

'It fell from a Sports Cruiser which does 105 knots (194.46 km/h) ground speed; I was at circuit altitude [of] 1,000ft above ground level.

The pilot said the MacBook Air fell from a Sports Cruiser (stock image pictured) which does 105 knots (194.46 km/h) ground speed. He as flying at circuit altitude [of] 1,000ft above ground level when the canopy popped open and the notebook fell to the ground

Inside the bag containing the MacBook Air (pictured) was also an ID book, av80r's pilot's licence and other identifying documents that Malopo used to track down the notebook's owner

'My laptop fell out of my plane because the canopy popped open. 

'Malopo claimed he heard a whistling sound and when he looked up he saw a bag hurtling towards him. 

'He took one step to the left and it landed where he was standing.

In December, Apple filed a patent for a system that could mean an end to smashed iPhone screens. 

It suggests Apple engineers will use the iPhone's internal vibration motor to control the angle of the fall while it's mid-air.

At the same type, various sensors - such as the accelerometer, GPS, gyroscopes and an ultrasonic emitter - would be used to analyse the phone's angle of descent in real-time.

A processor can then do a statistical analysis of the fall by comparing gathered data against other information stored in device memory.

'The laptop is still functional although the cooling system is damaged and the glass on the trackpad is starting to fall out.'
