A man who sold a broken record player after clearing out his loft will not have a Blue Christmas this year, because it used to belong to Elvis.

Jim Jenkins and his wife Ellen were given the Ebner Musical 5v Luxus by the King of Rock 'n' Roll as a wedding present, when he was stationed in Germany in the early part of his army service from 1958 to 1959.

The gift was intended as a thank you to German Mrs Jenkins, who had helped the music pioneer's father Vernon with translation.

The record player (pictured) owned by Elvis Presley during his time in the US Army in Germany made £4,400 at auction this week

Mrs Jenkins had visited the Presley's hotel apartment several times to speak to Elvis at length, as well as going to parties where he would play records and his guitar on the Luxus.

In 1959 the hotel asked him to leave because of complaints from other residents.

The record player broke, and was left to gather dust in the loft at the couple's home when they retired to Cornwall in 1989.

This week the historical item sold for £4,400 and Mr Jenkins, who is not an Elvis fan, could not be happier.

He said: 'We used it at parties. It had a great sound. But the needle broke so I put it away in the loft thinking I would fix it one day.'

And retired Mr Jenkins said that the only reason he didn't throw away the turntable is that he saw Elvis using an identical one in a newspaper article.

In fact, Mr Presley had used the same player that he gave to the couple as an amplifier when using his guitar.

The Luxus had three record speeds for singles and long players and a 
built in amplifier which helped Elvis relive the sound that his fans 
heard.

Mr Jenkins sold the record player at David Lay’s Penzance Auction House in west Cornwall.

The winning bid - twice the estimate - was online and the player will be heading back to Germany.

Auctioneer David Lay said: 'I have never come across anything that has created so much excitement.

'We got a lot of interest from Germany.'
