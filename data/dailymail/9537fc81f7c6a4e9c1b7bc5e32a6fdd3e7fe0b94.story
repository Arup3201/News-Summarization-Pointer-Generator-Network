First year nursing students at Flinders University in Adelaide are outraged after being forced to resit a compulsory subject that's been described as a scam.

The three week introductory course, Nursing Profession and Independent Learning or NURS1001, requires nursing students to score 100 per cent in all 25 quizzes in order to pass. Questions include the cost of printing at the university's library and the title of a student council magazine.

Samantha Rose Jones, 20, questioned the relevance of such trivial questions in a recent post online and it seems as though she doesn't stand alone.

'I feel let down and disappointed by Flinders Univesity,' she told MailOnline.

Ms Jones, who's originally from NSW and achieved top of the state in the Higher School Certificate human services - assistant in nursing exam in 2012, described the unrealistic standards of the topic as 'a form of academic bullying'.

'I don't understand why the nursing students from our uni have a compulsory topic like this when students doing other degrees don't have to do it,' she said.

'To me it sounds like a great way to make easy money. It seems like a scam and a way of exploiting students.'

Ms Jones was one of the students who failed the topic which commenced in March.

'I didn't get 100 per cent in the passport quiz. I got 97.22 per cent,' she said.

'I didn't know exactly where to get help. I emailed my tutor for help with answering these questions since I had almost used up my 5 attempts. Her vague response of "perhaps you are ticking too many boxes?" didn't help me, so I failed the questions about where to get help after trying to get help.'

Ms Jones said students who fail NURS1001 are offered a supplementary quiz, which contains questions from all of the quizzes.

'In failing that, students are required to enroll in winter school at a cost of $750 for domestic students and $2800 for internationals,' she said.

After Ms Jones disputed the fairness of her grading for nearly two months, her course co-ordinator Jan Thompson finally agreed to regrade her with a pass.

But others haven't been so lucky. Ms Jones said many of her classmates who failed the topic are being forced to enroll in winter school to resit the topic.

She's further angered at the fact that Ms Thompson advised her that she will not be making changes to the topic, despite numerous complaints from students who have since sent emails to the Dean of Nursing to fight their grade.

Students who fail must resit the topic for an extra $750 at winter school in order to move onto their next semester of studies

However another first year nursing student, who anonymously contacted MailOnline, believes the whole ordeal has been 'blown out of proportion'.

'I don't agree with the cost of the topic but it was designed to make it very easy to pass for everyone,' the student said.

'I really don't think it's much of an issue and it really isn't that hard to answer the questions correctly.'

The student also said the introductory topic also helped newcomers like himself the opportunity create new friendships.

Although Ms Jones agreed that some parts of NURS1001 was vital for her learning - including lab safety and mathematics - she argued that learning about learning about commas and full stops was 'total rubbish'.

MailOnline has contacted Flinders University several times for a comment.
