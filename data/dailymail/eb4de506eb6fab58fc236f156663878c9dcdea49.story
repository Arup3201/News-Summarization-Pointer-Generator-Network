A security guard shone a laser pen at the cockpits of passenger planes and a police helicopter while bored on coffee breaks at work.

Mark Savage, 27, targeted aircrafts coming in to land at Southampton Airport but claims he was 'was just mucking around' and 'wasn't thinking'.

Twice he aimed the beam at passenger planes, one of which was carrying 28 people - but despite risking lives with his reckless behaviour, Savage, of Hampshire, walked free from court today.

Spared jail: Mark Savage said he 'was just mucking around' when he shone a laser pen into the cockpits of passenger planes and was spared a prison sentence after a judge heard how he had mental health problems

Sparing him jail, a judge warned how his actions could have caused a crash and stated he 'could not think of anything more dangerous' to do.

Recorder Michael Vere-Hodge QC made the decision  after Southampton Crown Court heard how Savage had mental health problems.

He shone a beam at a cockpit of a Bombardier Q400 plane on a flight from Jersey that was preparing to land at Southampton Airport just before 9pm on September 9 last year, the court heard

Prosecutor Edward Phillips told the court co-pilot Edward Jarman was reaching a critical point in the landing stage when he saw a light reflecting off the plane's window.

Dangerous: Savage aimed the laser beam at several aircrafts including a Flybe plane, which was carrying 28 passengers, forcing the captain to switch off his external lights to land

Mr Phillips said: 'Fortunately the light wasn't in his eyes. He recognised the potential danger but was able to land the plane safely.'

A similar Flybe plane behind, captained by Matthew Donnellan, was carrying 28 passengers and three other crew members and was coming in from Paris, France.

Mr Phillips said Captain Donnellan had previously suffered temporary blindness and disorientation after a beam had been shone into his eyes so was considerably concerned when he spotted the light from Savage's pen.

He made the decision to switch off his external lights, a call he would not usually make, but he considered it less of a risk than being blinded by the laser and was able to land safely.

Mr Phillips said the matter was reported to police, who launched the force helicopter and found the source of light was coming from a compound near the Itchen Bridge in Southampton.

The pen was discovered under a rock and Savage was arrested and taken to the police station where he admitted being responsible.

Savage said he was 'just mucking around' and 'wasn't thinking' and accepted shining it at four or five planes on coffee breaks.

Savage, from Totton, Hants, admitted three charges of negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger aircraft. He received a six month suspended sentence with 12 months supervision.

David Storry, defending, said his autism and lack of understanding of consequences explains why he shone the light at planes.

He said: 'A reasonable person would know the potential consequences of what he was doing. He didn't think through the consequences of his actions and carried on doing it.

Also targeted: A Hampshire Police helicopter (like the one above) was called out and officers traced the source of the light and were able to arrest Savage, who admitted responsibility 

'One of his problems is that he gets bored very easily, lacks concentration and acts impulsively.

'He fully understands the case against him. The difficulty is the lack of understanding of the implications of his actions.'

Urging the court to impose a suspended sentence, Mr Storry said: 'He is vulnerable and wouldn't take well to a prison regime. He would be a fish out of water.'

Recorder Vere-Hodge QC said: 'They were flying over urban areas and if the planes had crash landed, there would have a likely high level number of injuries and damage.

'I cannot think of anything more dangerous in our modern world than shining a beam into the eyes of people flying aircraft.

'I hope you have got it into your head the amount of damage you nearly did and you will never, never put yourself into this kind of situation again.'
