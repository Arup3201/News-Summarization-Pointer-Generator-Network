Restaurant companies with 20 or more U.S. locations will have to post calorie counts for everything they sell beginning next year because of a little-noticed line buried deep inside the Obamacare law that some studies suggest could actually backfire.

The rule, buried 455 pages inside the Affordable Care Act, was the brainchild of lawmakers who modeled the idea after a 2008 New York City law. 

Dr. Thomas Frieden, now the embattled helmsman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spearheaded the New York City law and guided it through a series of legal challenges, arguing that information – as the saying goes – is power.

But after the Big Apple got a calorie sticker, researchers got a shock: New Yorkers eating at calorie-labeled restaurants consumer more calories than they had before the law took effect.

The public health scientists compared meal receipts collected from McDonald's locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn with similar meal tickets scooped up from the same restaurants a year earlier.

'Posting calorie benchmarks had no direct impact, nor did it moderate the impact of calorie labels on food purchases,' they wrote in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH). 

And the menu labeling 'appeared to promote a slight increase in calorie intake.' 

SIMPLE: Chipotle has a small range of offerings and already posts calorie ranges in every restaurant – a plan that probably won't pass the FDA's muster but is well-positioned for expansion

NOT SO SIMPLE: Most traditional fast-food joints have a range of options, toppings and sauces whose potential unique combinations range into the tens of thousands

UNCHANGED: Only restaurant companies with 20 or more locations will have to comply, meaning that most mom-and-pop restaurants could be at a nutritional advantage

More than one in four New Yorkers said they saw the calorie-counts and let the numbers affect their choices, but the receipts told a different tale.

The same researchers published a second finding in the journal Health Affairs: New York eaters took in more calories during the same period than restaurant patrons in nearby Newark, New Jersey – where there was no menu law. 

That's a sentiment shared by Chris Jackson, a Virginia businessman who told MailOnline at a Washington, D.C. steakhouse that he is better off not knowing how many calories are lurking in his dinner.

'The minute I have to stare at the numbers – what are they all, three digits? And I'm supposed to have a four-digit total? – everything on the menu is going to look doable. But you know, if I'm left to my own devices I tend to make the kind of choices I could explain to my wife with a straight face.'

Sondra Jacobson at the next table, however, said the idea is one whose time 'is long overdue.'

'The loaf of bread in my kitchen has a calorie label,' Jackson said. 'They're on everything but my cigarettes, and what's the harm? Some people need that kind of information and maybe they should have it.'

'Just keep it off my dining room table and I'm fine,' she said.

A man at her table who identified himself only as 'Jamie' and said he didn't want his last name in print because he works on Capitol Hill, said the menu labeling question was 'more about politics than science.'

'You have nutritionists on one side who want to be on your shoulder all the time like some caloric guardian angel,' he said, 'and you have the restaurants on the other wide who are trying to survive on razor-thin margins and, I think, reasonably, terrified that this will be the regulation that kills them.'

The science side of the debate is decidedly mixed. 

An AJPH study unrelated to the first one, and about one-fourth as large, showed a modest decrease in calorie intake when eaters were shown calorie counts, but the dinners they ate ate weren't served in restaurants.

'If someone is going to serve you thousands of calories, the least they could do is tell you how many calories it has,' says nutrition activist Margo Wootan

A third research report published in Health Affairs looked at 1,000 minority and low-income New Yorkers, finding no effect at all. 

A fourth, by Drexel University researchers, found a modest impact in Philadelphia but was criticized because it compared restaurants in different neighborhoods.

And a fifth found that Starbucks customers trimmed back their food calories by 14 per cent at locations where calorie counts were posted.

Lattes and frappucinos, however, kept their appeal: There was no impact on the beverage sales that make up more than 95 per cent of Starbucks sales. 

According to the Food and Drug Administration, a typical American female should consumer no more than 2,000 calories. Men should top out at 2,400. And no meal, according to the government, should tip the scales at more than 800 calories. 

The FDA will soon require the display of total calories in every menu item to show up 'in a clear and conspicuous manner' along with 'a succinct statement concerning suggested daily caloric intake.'

It's that second requirement that researchers in the first study thought might be confusing people.

Carnegie Mellon University professor Julie Downs told Health24 last year that consumers might see a 550-calorie Big Mac alongside an 800-calorie meal recommendation, and then 'maybe feel OK to go ahead and get a slightly bigger main dish, but at the same time still get the same side dish and drink they would normally get.'

'And then all of a sudden they're up over 1,100 calories for the meal. Each one item may seem OK, but it adds up.'

University of Alabama biostatistics professor Dr. David Allison, then president of the Obesity Society, told a court hearing a 2008 New York City menu labeling lawsuit that another avenue of backfire could be the 'forbidden-fruit allure of high-calorie foods.'

DAMAGE CONTROL: McDonald's has experimented with food tray liners that play up its lower-calorie items, but hide the health cost of a Double Quarter Pounder

WAITING ON THE FDA: A final rule from the government could come any day now, and will likely bring menus like this McDonald's concept to every big chain restaurant in America

He added that customers who heed the posted calorie warnings and walk away less full would be more likely to gorge themselves on calories later the same day. 

'What harms (if any) might result .... is difficult to predict,' he wrote. 

It's also difficult to know what will happen when Burger King has to disclose calorie counts but individual mom-and-pop restaurants won't. 

The debate over whether the idea works as intended – trimming America's waistline by sending fewer calories out of restaurant kitchens – has been over for four years despite the murky scientific picture.

Frieden, then head of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, conceded to the New York Times in 2008 that  

By 2009 state laws modeled after New York City's stretched from California to Maine and included nearly 20 county and city ordinances.

One of those laws was in Oregon, where government scientists found 'small but meaningful reductions in calories bought' 18 months later, 'particularly among the 20 percent of patrons who see and use the labels.'

The National Restaurant Association, among Washington, D.C.'s more powerful lobbies, opted in 2010 to embrace a national law that would let its member companies work from a single playbook instead of a patchwork quilt.

But implementing the law is full of political maneuvering. 

NOT FAR ENOUGH: Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin and Connecticut Rep. Rosa Delauro, both Democrats, want the menu labeling rules expanded to include bowling alleys, theme parks and even putt-putt courses

COMING TO A THEATER NEAR YOU? Buttered popcorn labels could be devastating for cinema chains that make most of their revenue on food concessions

Margo Wootan, chief nutritionist at the left-leaning Center for Science in the Public Interest, told The Hill on Monday that she's disappointed in how the FDA has interpreted Obamacare's food mandate.

Her group, which once famously turned fettucine alfredo into food porn by labeling it 'a heart attack on a plate,' wants to see movie theater concession stands subject to the same rules.

'If someone is going to serve you thousands of calories, the least they could do is tell you how many calories it has,'she told The Hill.

Wootan has the support of Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin and Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who want the FDA to force bowling alleys, movie theaters and amusement parks to follow suit.

'Congress intended the scope of the disclosure law to extend to movie theaters, bowling alleys, bookstore cafes, and other like establishments,' the pair has written to the FDA, 'which is the very reason Congress used the phrase 'and similar retail establishments' in the statute to extend the reach of the law beyond restaurants.'

While the restaurant lobby may have thrown in the towel, it appears the convenience store and family entertainment lobbies have gone all-in to protect their junk food franchises.

Most affected businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach, however.

The FDA could issue its final rule at any time, and the devil – or angel, depending on who's telling the story – could be in the details.

Pizza chains are hoping for loopholes that will allow them to avoid calculating every possible topping combination. 

'Pizza is so customizable that it's literally impossible to put all the calorie information on a menu.' Domino's executive vice president Lynn Liddle told The Hill.

The National Restaurant Association also wants the government to provide companies with a modicum of 'flexibility' so they won't have to guarantee that every steak or bowl of soup is nutritionally identical.

Fast food restaurants want an exemption for special orders so they only have to disclose calorie counts for sandwiches built according to their standard menus.
