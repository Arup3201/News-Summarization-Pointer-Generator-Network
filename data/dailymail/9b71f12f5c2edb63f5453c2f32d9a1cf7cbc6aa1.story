A taxi driver has said he has been left unable to work after his car was badly damaged following a collision with Newcastle United footballer Loic Remy's £100,000 sportscar.

Andrew Watson, 36, said he and the three passengers in his Fiat were left with minor injuries following the collision less than half a mile from St James' Park.

The incident took place when the France international's Audi R8 pulled out from a junction.

The father-of-three, from South Shields, told The Sun he was later told by police that the driver of the Audi was Premier League footballer Remy.

According to the paper, the 26-year-old was seen hobbling away from the car following the incident.

Mr Watson said: 'The car turned right in front of me and all I could do was slam my brakes on but we hit it.'

He said: 'Friends hope I haven’t damaged Remy for the derby with Sunderland. But I’m not into football.'

Remy is on loan at Newcastle United from Championship team Queens Park Rangers.

He has scored five goals in his last three Premier League outings.

Newcastle United would not comment on the incident when approached by MailOnline.

A Northumbria Police spokesman said officers received reports of a collision between an Audi R8 and a Fiat Scudo in Newcastle at about 9.40pm on Saturday, October 5.

The spokesman said: 'Officers attended and the road was closed for a short time to allow for vehicles to be recovered. Passengers of the taxi were taken to hospital to be checked over.'
