A teenager from Minneapolis has been charged with supporting the so-called Islamic State after he was arrested while allegedly on his way to join the insurgent group.

Abdullahi Yusuf, 18, was stopped at Minneapolis airport before he could board a plane to Turkey, the country which most wannabe jihadists pass through to reach terror group's strongholds in Syria.

Agents are still looking for 20-year-old Abdi Nur, a contact of Yusuf's, who left for Istanbul, the Turkish capital, the next day and didn't return.

Islamic State fighters: A teenager from Minneapolis has been charged with supporting the terrorist group after he was arrested at an airport allegedly en-route to join their ranks in war-torn Syria

A fighter waves the ISIS flag in Raqqa, Syria:Abdullahi Yusuf, 18, was stopped at Minneapolis airport before he could board a plane to Turkey, but his alleged accomplice Abdi Nur boarded a plane the next day

Both have been charged with 'conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),' said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin.

Nur also is charged with providing material support to a foreign terror group.

U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said both young men conspired to join the Islamic State 'to engage in a campaign of terror in support of a violent ideology.'

Yusuf, a student at Inver Hills Community College who lives in Inver Grove Heights, a suburb of St Paul, appeared in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis yesterday, after he was first arrested in late May.

His attorney argued for his release, noting he had been going to school and work despite knowing for months that he was under investigation. But a magistrate judge ordered him held until a detention hearing Wednesday.

Both Yusuf and Nur are Americans of Somali descent. The charges come after FBI officials last summer said they had begun tracking a trickle of Somali-Americans from Minneapolis to Islamic State-held areas in Syria.

According to a criminal complaint unsealed yesterday, Nur was a Facebook 'friend' of Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, a man also known as Miski who was indicted in Minneapolis in 2009 on charges of being involved with Al Shabaab.

The complaint said Hassan remained a fugitive.

It said Yusuf, who came to the attention of the FBI after a tip-off from passport office workers, was an 'associate' of a person identified only as 'H.M.', a former Minnesota resident now believed to be fighting in Syria.

According to the complaint, a passport specialist noticed Yusuf didn't have a specific itinerary, the name of a hotel or details about a person he claimed he was going to see in Istanbul.

The specialist also noticed Yusuf became nervous. He alerted his supervisor, who went to the FBI.

Education: Inver Hills Community College in Inver Grove Heights, where Yusuf was a student 

Arrest: Yusuf was picked up by FBI agents as he tried to board a plane at Minneapolis St Paul Airport

Court documents claim that after the passport office tip-off FBI agents watched Yusuf as he opened a bank account and deposited $1,500 that he used to buy a plane ticket to Turkey.

On May 28, the FBI watched as Yusuf's father drove him to school. About an hour later, Yusuf walked to a mosque, then was picked up in a Volkswagen Jetta that authorities say Nur had been driving in recent days.

It is claimed that during the short car journey Yusuf changed clothes while the driver helped him pack items into a duffel bag and backpack, ABC News reports. The car dropped Yusuf to a light rail station from where he made his way to the airport.

Agents arrested Yusuf before he was able to board his flight. When they told him they believed he wanted to travel to Syria to join a terrorist group, Yusuf is alleged to have said: 'I never committed no terrorist crimes that you're accusing me of.'

Authorities tried to find Nur after learning he was connected to the car. But the FBI learned on May 29 that Nur had left Minneapolis that day for Istanbul.

The criminal complaint said Nur had become 'much more religious' in the two months before his departure and spoke about jihad. After he left for Turkey, a witness went to a mosque that Nur attended in Bloomington, a Minneapolis suburb, and confronted several people, according to court documents.

Investigators said Nur also had been communicating on Facebook with another Minneapolis man who authorities believe went to Somalia in 2008 to join al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab.

Assistant Attorney General Carlin said: 'More than 16,000 recruits from over 90 countries traveled to Syria to become foreign terrorist fighters with alarming consequences.'

'This is a global crisis and we will continue our efforts to prevent Americans from joining the fight and to hold accountable those who provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations,' he added.

'With these two defendants, we have now charged more than 15 individuals with offenses related to the foreign fighter threat in Syria.'

FBI Director James Comey said this month his agency was tracking close to 150 Americans it believe had traveled to Syria. A federal official said authorities believe around a dozen Americans were fighting there with the Islamic State.

Yusuf's parents — who authorities said didn't know about their son's plans — attended Tuesday's court hearing but declined to speak to The Associated Press.

The Islamic State organisation emerged in spring 2013 from the warring groups in Syria's civil war. The jihadists proclaimed a 'caliphate' this June after seizing swathes of Iraq and Syria.
