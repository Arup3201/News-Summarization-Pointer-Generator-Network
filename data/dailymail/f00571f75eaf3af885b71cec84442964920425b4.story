She has graced the cast of EastEnders with her presence since 1986, but Pat Evans is about to leave the BBC soap with a bang.

Pat, played by Pam St. Clement, will be killed off the series during a huge fire in Albert Square, reports claim.

The scene will be broadcast during Christmas, to mark her departure after 25 years on the soap.

The end of an era: After 25 years on the soap, it is being reported that Pat Evans is set to leave EastEnders at the end of the year

Producers are planning to create a replica of the show’s B&B, which they will set on fire at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.

A show source told the Daily Mirror: ‘The last time EastEnders built something on this set was when they set fire to the Queen Vic last year.

‘It is only used when they need to film fires and explosions.

‘They want Pam’s character to go out with a bang. The script is so top secret even she doesn’t know how Pat is going to go yet.’

But as Pat is killed off, viewers will be treated to her stepson Ricky and granddaughter Bianca returning to the show.

A spokesperson for EastEnders stated: ‘There has been a lot of speculation about Pat’s departure.

‘We are not going to comment as we do not want to spoil it for viewers.’

The 63-year-old actress arrived on the set on June 12 1986, just over a year after the soap was first broadcast.

She is the second longest running character in EastEnders, after Adam Woodyatt, who plays Ian Beale.

Although the show spokesperson hasn’t confirmed how her character will be killed off, it is confirmed that she is leaving the soap at the end of the year.
