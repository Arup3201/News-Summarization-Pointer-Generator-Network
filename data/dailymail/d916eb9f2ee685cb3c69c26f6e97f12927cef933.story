A university student has been sacked from his campus job for allegedly taking a naked photo of a female student when her eyes were closed during sex.

The woman did not know the man had taken the photo - or that he had shown it to other students at the University of Sydney - until six months later.

He eventually wrote in an apology letter to her, published by student newspaper Honi Soit: 'I took a photo of us in a state of undress without your knowledge or consent... After I found the photograph, I showed it to other students that we both know.'

She believed the private letter was not enough and has battled to have the second-year student publicly reprimanded since earlier this year.

The University of Sydney have taken action against a student who took a naked photo of another student and shared it among friends at the university 

Only now has the university’s Vice-Chancellor, Michael Spence, decided that the 20-year-old will be forced to leave his role as a Resident Liaison, the Sydney Morning Herald has revealed. 

The student’s job saw him assist students living in university accommodation. 

Vice-Chancellor Michael Spence announced that the 20-year-old student had been sacked 

‘The decision follows discussions with student representatives at the Student Consultative Committee about the University's handling of a sexual harassment complaint,’ the university said in a statement on Tuesday.

‘At that meeting Dr Spence undertook to investigate the responsibilities of the Resident Liaison position. The position is unpaid and does not involve pastoral care but requires a high standard of personal conduct and behaviour to be maintained at all times.’

The university’s handling of sexual harassment complaints are continuing to be discussed according to the university.

When the existence of the photos was first revealed the university organised for the male and female student to meet after he apologised with the private written letter.

However, the female did not think this was enough and wanted a public apology.

‘Justice done in the dark can’t be seen to be justice,’ she told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'I had to fight to get Student Affairs to consider it a breach of misconduct and investigate my claim. It took months to process it (from January to August),' the woman told Honi Soit.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the University of Sydney's student union for comment.
