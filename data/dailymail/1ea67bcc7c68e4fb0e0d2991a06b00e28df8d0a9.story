A surgeon who uses laser surgery to boost women's sex lives faces being struck off for damaging five patients.

Professor Phanuel Dartey - who has pioneered the use of lasers for cosmetic genital surgery - is due to appear before the General Medical Council next week.

The 68-year-old who claims he has helped hundreds of women patients over the last three years, has been suspended for 18 months while his case was investigated.

Some women resort to vagina rejuvenation after childbirth because loosening of the vaginal canal can affect how much they enjoy sex (posed)

He practised at several major private hospitals in London and two years ago hit the headlines with an injection designed to enlarge the G spot.

The jab is said to increase the number of orgasms experienced by a woman by making it easier for their partners to hit the target.

But professor Dartey's main work was in the controversial area of 'vaginal rejuvenation' using a laser treatment developed in the USA. His operations cost as much as £6,000. Some doctors believe that such surgery should be banned.

Many of Dartey's patients were women who wanted their sex lives restored following difficult childbirth while others were concerned about the external appearance of their genitals.

Professor Dartey claims that he has been suspended on the basis of one complaint from a patient who had undergone cosmetic surgery on her labia.

He said: 'She wasn't happy with the aesthetic result of the operation. That can happen. This type of surgery is very personal and I always offer further surgery without charge if the end result wasn't quite what was wanted.'

But the GMC's case is that he harmed a number of patients and also worked without medical insurance.

Professor Dartey's case will come before the GMC on 14th November

He is charged with not obtaining consent for labial surgery from one patient, not telling her about risks and complications and leaving her scarred.

He is alleged to have operated 'inappropriately' on another lady and with a third failed to manage post surgery complications.

Another patient suffered a punctured uterus and fifth was left in pain after 'inappropriate' surgery.

Professor Dartey - a gynaecologist and obstetrician -runs the UK Laser Gynaecology Centre from rooms in London's Harley Street.

The vagina can often loosen after childbirth which can decrease enjoyment of sex.

The cosmetic procedure involves using a laser to tighten the muscles in the vaginal canal.

It is a non-invasive procedure that takes one to two hours.

It is said to cause less scarring than a scalpel and cautery machine as it can both cut and seal blood vessels.

Recovery time is eight weeks on average but women can return to work after a week.

It is performed in a number of clinics in the U.S, 
but Professor Dartey was the only one to offer it in the UK.

His website states: 'The majority of operations performed at the UK LGC are on women post childbirth suffering from vaginal prolapse resulting in urinary stress incontinence.

'Procedures are available to rejuvenate the structures of the vagina to their pre-pregnancy state and for women with no children, aesthetic solutions are available through cosmetic procedures.'

Professor Dartey said: 'I was shocked that the GMC decided to suspend me. They have presented no serious evidence that I am a risk to patients. 

'The expert witness who they used to criticise my surgery isn't even qualified in laser surgery so can't judge my results.'

He claimed: 'I have lots of satisfied women patients since I started using a laser for this type of surgery.  I have carried out more than 250 operations using the laser and there have been no complaints.

'Quite a lot of patients have surgery because childbirth has affected their sex lives or even caused medical problems like urinary incontinence.

'I have had lots of compliments from patients who have said my surgery has transformed their lives.

'I have practised in this country for 40 years and have never had any complaints by patients to the GMC.'

A leading private dentist - who had 'vaginal rejuvenation' carried out by Dartey claimed the surgeon had done a 'fantastic job' for her and been 'very caring and attentive'.

She said: 'I have birth to four strapping kids and as a result things below got out of shape. 

'It affected my sex life and gave me urinary incontinence. Professor Dartey used his laser technique and he transformed my life. I can't speak to highly of him.

'I was so happy with the result that I would speak to other women who were considering the surgery. I was shocked to hear that Professor Dartey had been suspended and I've written to the GMC supporting him.'

One of his anaesthetists from the world-famous Royal Marsden Hospital wrote a testimonial to the GMC describing Dartey's work surgical work as "painstaking" and "caring" and that he was particularly concerned about the safe use of the laser.

Despite practising in Harley Street and at some of London's top private hospitals, three time married Professor Dartey, lives alone in a modest two up two down terraced house in Edmonton, North London and drives a 20 year-old Daimler Sovereign.

He claimed: 'I don't make a lot of money by the time I've paid for the operating theatre and an anaesthetist. I also 'redo' some operations if patients aren't totally happy.

'I'm not in private practice to make a fortune. I take lot of time with my patients. This is intimate surgery and give patients a lot of my time to make sure they are happy.

'And I generally don't charge for this. I want patients to be happy with surgery and I won't charge if they think the final result is not quite right.'

Just days before his suspension in March last year he was giving a lecture on laser surgery at the Royal Society of Medicine.

Ghanian-born Dartey - who gained his medical degree in Russia - trained up to consultant level in the NHS before going into private practice in the 1980s.  At one stage he ran a fertility clinic in Wanstead, East London which went bust.

A leading consultant gynaecologist who specialises in the same sort of surgery, but without laser, said: 'This is a difficult area of surgery, particularly when you operate on external genitalia. The end result is very personal.

'Professor Dartey has an additional problem because he is the only surgeon in this country using the laser for this type of work.'
