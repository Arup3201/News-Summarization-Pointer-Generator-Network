A rusty 103-year-old electric car rendered obsolete by the invention of the automobile is tipped to sell for £50,000 as it has turned out to be way ahead of its time.

While electric cars are being hailed by many as the future of transportation today, a rudimentary version was being manufactured in the early 20th century.

Looking like a cross between something from the Wacky Races and a golf buggy, the car had a top speed of just 25mph.

Dodo, a 103-year-old Detroit Electric Model D that was thought for a century to be an evolutionary dead end has emerged for auction - and has now turned out to be way ahead of its time

It had a range of 100 miles but had to be plugged into a giant 6ft tall charger before every journey.

Manufacturing came to an end in the 1920s when the mass production of the petrol car left it trailing in its wake.

The 1910 Detroit Electric Model D that has now emerged for sale would have cost £1,500 at the time, the equivalent of £85,000 today.

Modern-day electric cars such as the Nissan LEAF are now priced at around £25,000.

In the early 20th century, the electric car was preferred over the early petrol versions as it was simple to operate and was a lot quieter.

Henry Ford, founder of The Ford Motor Company, bought two Detroit electric cars for his wife Clara for this reason.

Rupert Banner, a car specialist at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Electric cars are all the rage now but Detroit Electric was doing very well with them 100 years ago.

'The company became the most successful manufacturer of electric cars and this is a very early version of what they produced.

'They were very popular into the 1920s.

'This one still has the same interior it had back then and has been well preserved.

'It's like stepping back in time.

'It has been in a museum for a number of years now.

Experts at Bonhams say the car is relatively easy to restore, and could soon be in full working order

'It's a very interesting car and it still has its original transforming unit with it, which is extremely rare.

'It looks like something you could power an entire grid with these days, it is so big.

'Once the petrol car came in the days of the Detroit Electric Model were always going to be numbered.

'People could go longer distances and there were now no limitations, which especially in a country as big as America, made all of the difference.

'Detroit were unquestionably the most successful at the electric cars though, that is without question.'

The car comes with its original charger and experts believe it will provide a straight forward restoration project for the new owner.

It went defunct in 1939.

In recent years Detroit Electric has been in negotiations with companies in China and Malaysia about reviving the brand.

The car will be sold at auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, US, on January 17.

The 1910 Detroit Electric Model D was a popular vehicle for thousands of motorists in the early years of the 20th century before the widespread production of petrol cars rendered it obsolete.

The car, which has been in a museum for the past decade, is expected to fetch £50,000 when auctioned by Bonhams this week
