A 20-year-old from Cheshire won £1,250 after betting on MK Dons to beat Manchester United 4-0, but hadn't even meant to place the bet.

Holly Griffiths, a United fan who attends the majority of their home games, placed £2.50 on MK Dons to win by four goals at odds of 500/1.

She told Sportsmail: ‘My friend had just put a bet on United to win 4-0 so I thought I’d do the same. I wasn't paying much attention though and ended up putting it on MK Dons instead.

Remarkably, Holly admitted that she had not even watched the game, and only realised she had a chance of winning the bet shortly before the match ended.

She said: ‘I wasn't actually watching the game – I’d turned it off - and realised 10 minutes before the end.

‘It was unbelievable. 

‘I’ve just taken up horse riding again so want to buy a horse. I wanted one before my 21st birthday in January.'

Upon discovering her win, she tweeted: 'Oh my god as if I won this on a free bet that I thought I was putting on United oh my god oh my god.'

United have endured a torrid start under Louis van Gaal. 

They lost to Swansea on the opening day of the Premier League season and then drew away at Sunderland.

And after last night's League Cup exit, United are out of all but two competitions by August - a feat not even achieved by Van Gaal's much-maligned predecessor, David Moyes.
