David Cameron's Chief Whip was last night at the centre of allegations that he has used ‘leaked’ MPs’ expenses to ‘bully’ enemies of the Prime Minister.

The claims have been made by Tory rebels who say it is part of a campaign of intimidation to stop them speaking out against Mr Cameron’s policies on Europe and gay marriage.

They accuse Sir George Young – who is charged with imposing discipline on the increasingly fractious Parliamentary party – of ‘victimising’ them by using confidential details of their travel and housing claims.

Now one rebel MP has made a formal complaint to the Government’s official watchdog, the Information Commissioner.

He has accused the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) – the body that monitors MPs’ pay and perks – of breaching the Data Protection Act by passing information to Sir George.

The MP, who has defied the whips to call for a cut in the EU budget and vote against gay marriage but asked not to be identified, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Sir George warned me that I should play ball with Ipsa, or risk personal financial details being made public. I feel that amounted to blackmail.

‘I wrote to Sir Ian Kennedy, the chairman of Ipsa, to complain, and received a letter back which told me that, “MPs should not be surprised that Ipsa has dealings with Chief Whips”.

‘That is why I have complained to the Commissioner. Ipsa should not be passing information to third parties.’   

Relations between MPs and Ipsa have become increasingly acrimonious since it introduced a rule that requires them to hand back a share of the profit on  the rising value of taxpayer-funded  second homes.

It has left some MPs facing demands for more than £50,000.  

The row has broken out amid claims that Sir George has found out which rebels owe money to Ipsa and then used the information to ‘intimidate’ them – an allegation that is strongly denied.  

Another MP claimed he was told by Sir George that he should settle a disputed expenses claim if ‘he wanted to be an MP at the next Election’.

A third MP said: ‘Sir George is trying to find a new way to victimise and bully the rebels, threatening to take their whip away or “tell the boss” if they don’t cough up to Ipsa.’

A source close to Sir George said:  ‘It is complete paranoid nonsense to suggest that the Chief Whip has in any way used MPs’ expenses difficulties as a way of enforcing discipline. It’s just not his style.

‘It is perfectly normal for the Chief Whip to discuss an MP’s expenses with them if there is an issue.

‘The information about the expenses of the MP who has complained was  not confidential.’

Last night, an Ipsa spokesman said it was ‘perfectly reasonable’ for the body to ‘raise concerns’ about MPs with chief whips.

‘Where MPs claimed for a subsidy from the taxpayer for their mortgage, we ask for the taxpayer’s share of any increase in the value of the property,’ he said.

‘If an MP refused to comply with  that rule, we would challenge that,  and it is reasonable that we raise  our concerns.’
