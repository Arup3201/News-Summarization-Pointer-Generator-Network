Jailed: Sarah Hallcup has been sentenced to two years in prison for conspiracy to commit burglary

A trusted nanny who worked for the Duke of Wellington’s youngest son was jailed yesterday for helping her lover ransack his country home.

Sarah Hallcup was treated as part  of the family by Lord Christopher Wellesley, 48, and his wife Emma.

They were so close that Lady Wellesley, 36, became godmother to unmarried Hallcup’s 19-month-old son.

But while the Wellesleys and their three children were on holiday, she helped her boyfriend steal heirlooms worth £30,000 from Top Hill House, the family’s  £1million three-storey mansion in Heckfield, Hampshire, a court heard.

The haul taken by Hallcup, 28, and Neal Akhtar, 27, included paintings, a Cartier clock, a pair of silver pheasants worth £250 and busts of Lord Wellesley’s  famous ancestor, the first Duke of  Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.

The pair also ransacked the small one-bedroom annexe where Hallcup lived in an attempt to make it look like a break-in.

But detectives became suspicious when they could find no sign of a forced entry and Hallcup, who had worked for the family for four years, showed no  concern about the burglary.

Akhtar was arrested after his fingerprints were found in the house.

Officers discovered pictures of the haul on his mobile phone and camera, as well as records of contact with antiques dealers about selling some of the goods.

Hallcup was arrested after admitting she and Akhtar were in a relationship.

Police discovered texts between the pair about ‘robbing the mansion’ while she had used her phone to carry out an internet search for the value of the clock.

Messages from Akhtar’s BlackBerry showed he had offered the stolen goods for sale to antiques dealers and he had also tried to sell some of the haul to his uncle.

Many of the items taken, including a Tiffany-style bracelet with the inscription ‘E love M’ belonging to Lady Wellesley, have never been recovered.

Hallcup had denied involvement in the raid in July last year but was convicted last month of conspiracy to burgle.

Jailing her for two years at 
Winchester Crown Court yesterday, Judge Andrew Barnett said: ‘You were a
trusted nanny who became a family friend.

‘They trusted you to look after their property and it was a trust which you breached and, in effect, betrayed.

‘The effect that this burglary had upon the Wellesley family was truly devastating.’

Akhtar, from Reading, who has previous convictions for burglary, admitted conspiracy to burgle and was jailed for three years.

Scott Allaway, 27, also from Reading, 
who admitted driving away the haul in his van, was jailed for 18 months 
for handling stolen goods.

Prosecutor Kerry Maylin said the 
Wellesley family had been left  ‘devastated’ by the burglary and the 
loss of treasured possessions.

‘The items were of enormous 
sentimental value to Lady Wellesley,’ she said. ‘She is very clearly 
devastated, both for herself and for her family whose home was 
violated.’

Anthony Harrison, for Hallcup, said 
that while she was not put under duress there was ‘pressure and 
persistence’ from Akhtar to commit the offence.
