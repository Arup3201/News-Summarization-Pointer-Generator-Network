Protesters filmed themselves blocking a London road with dozens of parked cars as they called for Israel to relinquish its grip on Gaza amid concerns the community is becoming 'radicalised'

Drivers parked their cars, honked their horns and shouted 'free free Palestine', bringing the major commuter route in east London to a standstill. 

Local councillors claim the footage is the latest cause for concern that the community is becoming 'radicalised' and 'one-sided'.

Blocked: Dozens of drivers parked their cars and honked their cars in Blackwall tunnel shouting 'free Palestine'

Protest: Other cars were branded with Palestinian flags and the word 'Gaza' as traffic came to a standstill

The demonstration took place on July 20 in the Blackwall tunnel which connects Greenwich in south London with Tower Hamlets, an east London borough with a large Muslim population, police confirmed.

The footage of parked cars covered in 
Palestinian flags and the word 'Gaza' emerged on YouTube early this week
 and has been shared on Facebook more than 6,000 times. 

It is unclear how long the tunnel remained blocked during the incident.

It came just days before Tower Hamlets's Muslim mayor sparked outrage by raising the Palestinian flag outside the town hall.

Condemning the protest, Conservative Tower Hamlets councillor Andrew Wood told MailOnline: 'My main concern is that the community is being radicalised by all this. 

'It is obviously very concerning. It's something I'm worried about. There are issues in other parts of the world like Ukraine and Nigeria - and there are issues in Tower Hamlets. 

'But there is a danger in Tower Hamlets that we are focussing our attentions on one part of the world. Mayor Lutfur Rahman put a Palestine flag outside the town hall. Obviously that was a very strong message. It is not a balanced conflict, we shouldn't be taking sides.

'Concern': Local councillors said the footage was the latest cause for concern the area is being 'radicalised'

'Last night at our council meeting, we spent 45 minutes speaking about Gaza which meant we ran out of time to talk about GP surgery closures.  

'We need to ensure we maintain a balanced view.'

His words came hours after Mayor Lutfur Rahman flew the Palestinian flag outside the town hall in Tower Hamlets.

Barely 24 hours after it emerged Mr Rahman is to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud, he ordered the flag to fly ‘in support of a ceasefire and peace’.

Jewish leaders condemned the move as 'destructive' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' and not international conflicts.

In a statement Mr Rahman said: 'We are flying the Palestinian flag over the town hall as a humanitarian gesture of our solidarity with the people of Gaza.

'In addition to the current military onslaught, the blockade of Gaza is causing a humanitarian catastrophe. Over 1,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. An urgent aid corridor needs to be opened to allow those injured to receive treatment and medical care. 

'We mourn the loss of life in this tragic conflict. We call on our Prime Minister to help create a lasting peace that breaks the cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians and prevents any further loss of innocent lives.' 

An estimated 1,300 Palestinians and 59 Israelis have been killed in the conflict. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after a surge in rocket fire from the territory.

Hamas, which controls Gaza, has said it will not stop fighting until a blockade on the area, maintained by both Israel and Egypt, is lifted.

Anger: Residents blasted Mr Rahman for focusing on Gaza rather than concerns in the east London borough

Support: The act garnered support from a number of people in the area which has a large Muslim community

Already this month there have been angry rows about Preston Town Council and Bradford Council flying the Palestinian flag.

David Israel of the Leeds Jewish community said the Preston council was wrong to take sides in the conflict. innocent Israeli civilians have suffered through war and conflict,' he told the BBC.

'If you're going to put up one flag you need to put up the other flag to show support for innocent civilians on both sides on the conflict.'

Earlier David Cameron announced an extra £3 million aid for Gaza as he repeated his call for an unconditional ceasefire to stop the conflict. Britain has already given £7 million in aid.

Speaking during a Q&A session with workers in Warrington, Mr Cameron said the £3 million would ‘help make sure the people in Gaza have the basic necessities of life, the food, the shelter and the assistance that they need’.
