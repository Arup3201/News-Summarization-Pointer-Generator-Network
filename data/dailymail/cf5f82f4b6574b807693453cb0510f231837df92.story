I love my job but without doubt the best part of it comes every Saturday afternoon, presenting the football extravaganza that is Matchday Live on talkSPORT from one of the top games of the day.

This Saturday topped the lot. At a cramped but cosy Croft Park, restricted by the most limited and challenging resources, I hosted the show while watching Blyth Spartans take on Birmingham City in one of the best FA Cup ties I've ever seen.

As I said on air, it was 'thud and blunder' - a classic third-round tie which had everything - a bad pitch, tiny dressing rooms, a non-League minnow against a big club, but also the possibility of an upset.

Somehow this wasn't regarded as fit for live TV. Incredible.

So many people just do not understand the FA Cup, including some who should know better.

Take John Carver: he's had more than 30 years in the game, he's from Newcastle, he's a Newcastle United fan, he's been around the club for years as apprentice through to caretaker manager. And yet not even Carver understands how much the fans want to do well in the FA Cup. If he did, there is no way he would have picked that team who disgraced the great name of Newcastle United at Leicester City on Saturday.

Some have suggested the team selection wasn't down to Carver, but if that is the case I'm sure he wouldn't be interested in the manager's job permanently.

Let's be clear here: I have no problem with managers picking what some would consider a weakened side. If that manager believes it's a team that can win the game, then there is no issue. Swansea City are a good example from this weekend. Garry Monk knew he could win the tie at Tranmere Rovers with the 'weakened' team he selected - and he was proved right. But for Newcastle to risk a below-strength team against Premier League opposition who picked up points over Christmas and New Year, was pure folly and totally disrespectful to the Newcastle fans.

As for the TV execs who pick the games, some of the criticism aimed at them has been harsh. If it was easy to predict what's going to happen we'd all be millionaires. But the gulf between non-League and Premier League these days means Dover Athletic were always unlikely to beat Crystal Palace.

Everton against West Ham United might turn out to be brilliant, but there is nothing prior to the game suggesting it could be a classic.

An educated guess could have told anyone Blyth Spartans would be more likely to push Birmingham City close. No guarantee, but most genuine football fans were surprised the Spartans game wasn't on TV.

Blyth are run by a chairman who's a genuine philanthropist, a local businessman who puts his money back into the community to help local people. If ever a chairman deserved live football at his ground it's Tony Platten. He's even got views on the future of football which make interesting listening. I was grateful for the chance to spend some time with him live on talkSPORT on Saturday before the match.

The Blyth captain Robbie Dale has been at the club 10 years, is a barman at a local pub, and he scored both of Blyth's goals on the day.

The manager Tom Wade has supported the club since he was eight, his son plays for them, he lives two doors away from the chairman.

The stories were there, it had the makings of the classic it turned out to be, but TV seems obsessed with the Premier League these days.

Blyth did themselves proud against Birmingham but ultimately could not get beyond the FA Cup third round

It was a fantastic occasion at Blyth Spartans on Saturday, and a wonderfully dramatic game of football. TV missed out because someone making the decisions just doesn't 'get' the FA Cup.

John Carver and Newcastle United Football Club don't 'get' the FA Cup either. Newcastle won't be going down or getting into the Champions League so why not go for it with a full-strength side in the Cup?

The importance of the FA Cup has been questioned in the Premier League era.

But I've yet to interview a footballer who doesn't want to win it or do well in it. Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick have won everything at club level - apart from the FA Cup. Talk to either of them about that blip on their football CV and you'll be left in no doubt they both desperately want to win the FA Cup.

Supporters understand the FA Cup. Look how Arsenal fans celebrated last year. I love the FA Cup despite the fact my team Peterborough United have been useless in the competition for several decades.

Players understand the FA Cup. I interviewed Aaron Ramsey recently and brought up his goal at Wembley last season against Hull. He admitted he had watched the goal back again that morning. It clearly meant the world to him to score the winner in the FA Cup final.

Unfortunately managers, some owners, and TV executives don't understand the FA Cup.

Sadly these people are the key decision-makers in football.
