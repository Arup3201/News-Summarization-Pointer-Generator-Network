The family of a popular superhead who was found hanged at his home have criticised his former employers for placing him under months of unbearable stress. 

Mark Geadah, 43, was found dead in his summer house by his wife, Lesley, on August 24 and an inquest into his death heard he had been receiving treatment for work-related depression.

Speaking at a pre-inquest review hearing yesterday the family demanded answers for Mr Geadah's 'neglect' at work and said his lack of support was a 'slap in the face'.

Heavy workload: Mark Geadah had been receiving treatment for work-related depression before he was found dead by his wife in August

His father Monir Geadah said: 'He was a victim of his own success. When he took those jobs he was pressurised. He was a perfect, perfect son in every respect before that. 

'It is causing a lot of stress on us a family. I had a heart attack two weeks ago though this stress. The longer this drags the more it pressurises our family. The neglect is there.' 

The 43-year-old had served as head of Allington Primary School, in Kent, for nine years. 

During that time he oversaw two Ofsted inspections, both of which resulted in an 'outstanding' rating. 

His success did not go unnoticed and he became executive head at a second school in Kent - Aylesford Primary School - earlier this year, while continuing as head of Allington - both of which are academies. 

Following the inquest opening Kent County Council, Allington Primary School and the Valley Invicta Academies Trust, which runs Aylesford Primary, released a statement. 

Earlier this year, Mr Geadah had doubled his workload by taking on the role of executive head at Aylesford Primary School in Kent

It said: 'Mark Geadah was a highly gifted teacher and a national leader of education, the highest of professional accolades and one awarded only to people of the highest calibre. 

'He was ably assisted and supported by the senior management team and governing bodies of both schools,' the statement added. 

'We are devastated by his death but we will inherit the success he and his teams achieved, build on that and be worthy of his legacy.' 

But the family yesterday insisted he was not supported by his management in the months leading to his death. 

They also questioned the treatment he received from medical authorities as a result of his depression. 

His mother Jill Geadah said: 'They did so little to help Mark. When we found out that members of staff who knew him had been offered support it was a slap in the face. 

'They could have done so much more.' 

But Coroner Patricia Harding said the inquest does not serve to place blame and if the family wish to explore Mr Geadah's treatment by his employers they must do so through other agencies. 

She said: 'I am aware that the family have a number of concerns. 'There is a concern that the employers of Mr Geadah should be involved in the inquest. 

'The coroner's inquiry is to answer four important factual questions: who is the person who had died, how, when and where did that death occur. 

'And how means by what means - the sequence of events that led to the death and caused the death. 'The coroners' court is not a court of blame. 

'We do not look at issues of medical negligence. 'However we do look at issues of neglect and that is why I will commission an independent expert to look at that. 

'I am also not going to include the employers in my inquest because that falls outside of my remit.'

An inquest into his death opened and adjourned on September 1 and coroner Patricia Harding said it was unlikely the inquest would resume until next year.
