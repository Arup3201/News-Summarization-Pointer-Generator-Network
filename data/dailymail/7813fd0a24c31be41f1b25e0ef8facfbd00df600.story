Ever wondered just how much we spend on make-up over our lifetime, or how much star power really affects the way we shop?

A new infographic reveals just that, showcasing a collection of research from dozens of British surveys into women's and men's grooming habits.

Looking at the most iconic products of all time and ranking the importance of celebrity endorsements - the results might surprise you.

Beauty facts: Feel Unique commissioned the cool and quirky infographic, which states that women tend to bulk-buy cosmetics, whilst men are spending remarkably large amounts on grooming products

When it comes to celebrity pulling power, the research states that whilst A-list endorsements can undoubtedly increases sales, it's not the only factor.

Kim Kardashian has been reportedly paid $250,000 (£120,000) to tweet about a product to her nearly 22 million Twitter followers, and Cheryl Cole is one of the many celebrity ambassadors for L'Oreal, and has starred in campaigns for its foundation as well as Elnett hairspray.

But the research states that it is actually the opinion of friends, family and coworkers that matter the most.

Some 44 per cent of women said this would influence their decision of what to buy.

influence to sell millions of beauty products, though aren't the most important factor for buyers

Influence: Celebrities may boost product sales, but we trust friends, family and co-workers the most

Research: When it comes to selling power, celebrity endorsements give brands a massive boost, however, the infographic collated by Feel Unique also shows that brand loyalty is crucial

While 20 per cent said they would reply on online reviews, and just five per cent said they would go by purely the celebrity face of the product.

Brush of luck: Women spend an avergsr

Not only do women have an average of 54 
items in their make-up bag - from more than 12 countries they have travelled to -
 the total cost of her collection is £512.

Furthermore, women will spend a whopping £100,000 on cosmetics over her lifetime, which equates to £40 a week and £2,000 a year.

Men aren't that far behind: The average 30-year-old male spends £100 a month on grooming products and treatments, according to a survey by Debenhams.

The same study found men in their 40s tend to spend £70 a month of grooming.

FeelUnique.com, which created the infographic, collated surveys from the likes of OnePoll, Bionsen, the Daily Mail, Cosmopolitan and Vogue.

They also found that 57 per cent of women would rather break up with their boyfriend than break away from their make-up bag.

Two thirds of women have admitted to bulk-buying cosmetics in a bid to find the best product to suit them - even if they rarely or never actually use the product.

Others said they simply enjoyed splurging on beauty buys because it gave them 'great joy'.

The illustration looked in particular at what makes a beauty product iconic.

The found that in order for a product to reach this status, it must have 'unique appeal' and the consumer must feel an 'emotional bond' toward it.

It also needs to have 'credibility for repeat purchase'.
