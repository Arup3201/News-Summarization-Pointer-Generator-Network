Shocked bystanders watched aghast as huge sheets of ice slipped off the top of a building in Texas and onto cars below, completely crushing them.

Plano, in north Texas, has been hit hard with snow and ice since the weekend, but thawing temperatures have started to melt the large quantities of snow and ice that have built up.

The affect has caused major damage to vehicles parked in the streets.

In one case, which was caught on video, a Jaguar was crushed in Plano, after its roof collapsed and windows smashed under the weight of the falling freeze.

The sheets also damaged a Corvette and several other vehicles.

Wrecked: A Jaguar was severely damaged by an avalanche of snow that fell from an awning in Plano, North Texas, on Monday

Residents were warned of the dangers after the roof ice began to dislodge on Sunday.

'It could've killed somebody when it went down, they would've been dead for sure,' one witness, who shot the video, told NBC.

'I soon as I stopped filming we called 911.'

The avalanches were caused by temperatures rising above freezing, causing the ice to melt and move.

Luckily, there have been no reported injuries.

Plano police closed Bishop Road, near Shops at Legacy where the Jaguar was crushed, and taped off an additional area as ice continued to fall on Monday. 

At about noon, maintenance crews began pushing the ice down, trying to reduce the threat.  A few stores will remain closed until the sidewalks are safe.

This is the moment the thawed ice, which had melted from a slight rise in temperature, fell from the awning of a building in Plano and onto a Jaguar and other cars parked below

In a separate incident in the same area, a woman filming out her windown caught an incredible moment as a seemingly never-ending series of ice and snow falls from a building across the road.

The Plano woman, Amanda Christian can be heard gasping 'holy freakin' moly' once the avalanche finally finishes.

The extreme winter storm storm that coated parts of Texas in ice has struck the East Coast with unexpected force, blanketing some spots in a foot of snow, grinding highways to a halt and conditions are expected to remain Arctic from Missouri to Maine.

Residents have been warned to avoid parking under any awning or sloped roof where ice could slide and 
fall. 

Authorities have also said to take caution when walking near buildings, tall 
trees or 
anywhere where ice may have been built up.

More than 22,000 Dallas-area homes 
and businesses were still without power on Monday, according to electric
 utility Oncor.

That was down from 270,000 on Friday.

Dallas students also 
got a snow day.

More 
than 1,300 flights Monday were already canceled, the greatest share from
 Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which was still reeling from 
the effects of the ice storm that brought North Texas to a standstill.

About 650 people were stranded there 
Sunday night, down from Saturday night when about 2,000 travelers were 
stranded, spokesman David Magana said.

North
 Texas was shivering under below-freezing temperatures over the weekend -
 left behind after the ice storm that knocked out power lines, leaving 
some 267,000 customers in without power at the height of the storm, 
according to utility provider Oncor.

Nationally,
 there have been over 6,100 flight cancellations since Saturday, 
according to FlightStats.com, including more than 2,800 by American or 
its American Eagle regional airline.

American emerged from bankruptcy 
protection and merged with US Airways on Monday.
