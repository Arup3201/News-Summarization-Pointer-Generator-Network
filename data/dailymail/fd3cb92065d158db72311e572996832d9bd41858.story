There is nothing initially surprising about Ford Park Road, near the centre of Plymouth. At the top is a perfectly standard busy shopping street.

But a few minutes down the hill, and past  a park, there is a large and very pretty cemetery, dotted with yew trees, with lush grass growing among the headstones.

At the very bottom, before a thick wood of oak trees and behind the iron gate, appears a Victorian house. With Gothic arches, stained-glass windows and a sturdy wooden front door, it brings to mind the Gingerbread House in Hansel And Gretel.

Authentic: Old Oaks Lodge, set in the Ford Park Cemetery in Plymouth, was built in the 1840s for the cemetery groundskeeper

A cemetery may seem a strange place to live. But if you want a quiet setting, easy access to a busy city centre and an old house with a history, then five-bedroom Old Oaks Lodge, set in the Ford Park Cemetery and on the market for £390,000, might be ideal.

‘As soon as we saw the lodge, we knew we had to have it,’ says Philip Johnson, 70, who used to run a water taxi business on Plymouth quayside.

Now retired, he and wife Janice, 67, want to move somewhere with more outdoor space for their collection of vintage cars.

‘The house was built in the 1840s – about  the same time as the cemetery and chapel – for the groundsmen who maintained the graveyard,’ Philip explains.

Indeed, when they moved in, the house was very basic, with just a couple of large rooms and not even a proper staircase. The Johnsons have maintained the original church-like feel while also making a cosy living area.

‘We wanted to create an open-plan space downstairs which wasn’t chilly,’ says Philip. This is successfully achieved by having three rooms – the sitting room, kitchen and dining room – all flowing into each other, with no doors. The 15ft-high ceiling of the sitting room has gold mouldings.

A wood burner ensures that the room is pleasantly warm. ‘There is underfloor heating as well,’ Philip points out. This comes up through a church-style green painted iron grate.

All the windows in the house have stained glass. In this room, the sun shines through yellow and green glass. The kitchen has an Aga as well as a double oven – Janice finds it easy to cook for 20 when they have the whole family over for Christmas, including their two children and four grandchildren.

The dining room leads through to another sitting room – with high ceilings and a massive original fireplace. These windows are stained red and blue. Upstairs are two bedrooms and a bathroom, which the couple use as a master suite, with the smaller bedroom acting as a dressing room.

It is downstairs – down a winding ornate red iron staircase – that the house takes on a Tardis-like quality.

Here, below the house and where women used to make the funeral wreaths, there are three further bedrooms and two more bathrooms.

‘When we have family to stay, we all feel as though we have our own space,’ says Philip. In the main bedroom, a French window leads out into the garden, and an en suite bathroom has a Jackson Pollock-style painted red glass door.

‘I did that myself,’ Philip says proudly.

A huge green-tiled bathroom has mirrors around all the walls and a working fireplace next to the porcelain bath.

‘Light the fire, light a few candles, and it’s bliss,’ says Janice.

The garden is walled, with a Victorian-style summer house and a three-car garage which has a utility room, including a washing machine, sink and toilet.

‘This could be used as separate accommodation,’ muses Philip. He uses it for his vintage car collection, which includes a 1935 Daimler, one of the procession cars from the funeral of George VI.

For some, the thought of being surrounded by gravestones may be disturbing, but in  fact there is an air of quiet peace

. Walking up the hill to the chapel, where there is a separate visitors’ centre and cafe, friendly dog-walkers nod and smile, and the gravestones make fascinating reading.

On one lies a poppy wreath, left over from Remembrance Sunday. Although the engraving on the headstone is now faded with time, Captain Andrew Henry, VC, is still remembered by Plymouth residents.

The cemetery also contains the final resting place of another VC hero, naval rating George Hinckley, who was awarded the honour for rescuing wounded comrades during the Taiping Rebellion in 1862.

When the cemetery’s gates close every afternoon, the Johnsons’ grandchildren can play in the 34 acres of grassy cemetery. ‘It’s beautiful and safe for them,’ says Janice.

‘This stunning Grade II listed property is one that’s brimming with character and history,’ says Gareth Cooper at estate agent Fulfords. ‘This is one of those unique homes that are rarely available.’
