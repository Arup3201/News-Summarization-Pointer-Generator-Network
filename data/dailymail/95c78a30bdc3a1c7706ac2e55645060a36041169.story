Investigators in Chicago are trying to figure out how a severed human leg ended up on the shores of Lake Michigan yesterday - and to whom it belongs.

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the leg was found on a Kenwood neighborhood beach on Chicago's South Side Wednesday afternoon.

According to police, a call came in about 2:42 p.m. reporting that the severed human leg had washed up on shore.

Police say the leg was found by a person walking along the beach in the 4700 block of South Lake Shore Drive.

The leg was severed just below the hip.

This marks the second time in the last two weeks that human remains have been pulled from one of the Great Lakes.

The remains later were identified as female, but authorities are yet to identify the body.

In Chicago, investigators say an autopsy is scheduled for today at the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office.
