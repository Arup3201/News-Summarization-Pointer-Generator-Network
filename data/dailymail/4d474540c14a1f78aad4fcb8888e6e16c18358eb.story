Barcelona were so impressed by St George’s Park last week that they are set to return next summer.

Luis Enrique’s side used the National Football Centre in Burton for a pre-season training camp ahead of the new La Liga campaign.

The Catalan club have already held talks with the FA about the possibility of another stint at the facility next summer.

Impressed: Luis Enrique was delighted with the facilities at the National Football Centre

Out in force: All of Barcelona's stars including Gerard Pique trained there last week

High kicks: As did veteran midfielder Xavi, who was previously linked with a move away this summer

Barca’s intention to return will be a major boost to the FA because one of the aims of opening the state-of-the-art training facility was to attract world football’s elite clubs.

‘I had heard reviews of the place but I had never been to St George’s Park before,’ said Enrique. 

‘They’re top-class facilities, everything is so easy, so accessible, so perfectly structured and classified.’
