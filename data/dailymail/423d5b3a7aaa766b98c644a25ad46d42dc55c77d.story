Just three months after breaking nine vertebrate in her back in a terrifying sky-diving accident, Miss World Australia finalist Stephanie Campbell is back on the pageant scene and ready to tackle her next big challenge.

On March 16, less than 12 hours since qualifying for the state finals in another competition - Miss Universe Australia - the experienced skydiver hit trouble during her first jump of the day.

With a crash landing the 24-year-old hit the ground with such force she broke bones in her back, her right wrist, snapped six ribs which punctured both her lungs, and suffered a serious concussion with bruising to her face and body.

'A lot of the other skydivers assisted me... but when they said CareFlight was on the way I knew it was serious,' Ms Campbell told the MailOnline.

'One of the paramedics, Jeff, said he thought that I was going to die in the helicopter.'

Despite doubts from many doctors and gruelling weeks spent slowly recovering, the Brisbane-born thrill seeker is back on her feet with greater determination than ever.

'I think you have to be so grateful for everything that you have, and it’s just made me more determined to give back.'

In the first few days after the accident, Ms Campbell's body was supported using a specially molded spinal brace.

'They had to mold a spinal brace to my body and chest a few days after the accident.’

To take the impression doctors had to lift and move Ms Campbell’s body while she was still seriously injured, which could have caused further injury if anything went wrong.

She was airlifted to Princess Alexandra Hospital following the horrific skydiving accident in March which almost left her paralysed

'There were a lot of challenging experiences during that time and that was the one that held the greatest fear for me because obviously paralysis is something to be pretty scared of,' Ms Campbell revealed.

She said that now her recovery is going smoothly, she is even more motivated to do all she can to help others who are at any disadvantage, especially those who struggle with mobility.

Her next feat will be climbing the Story Bridge in Brisbane, a fundraising endeavor which is part of her role the upcoming Miss World Australia Finals.

'Brisbane's Story Bridge Adventure Climb has generously agreed to donate 50 percent of the price of standard bridge climb tickets purchased between 13-19 July jointly to Variety QLD and the Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing.

'If we sell 1000 tickets each charity will come away with $25,000.'

The fundraiser called 'Climb for a Cause' that Ms Campbell has organised is something she is looking forward to, and when asked if she would take part in the climb Ms Campbell said she couldn't wait.

'Definitely - I thinks that's why this project is so close my heart.'

'For the first five days after the accident when I didn’t have the ability to walk I was in a spinal bed and I couldn’t even move on my own.'

The 24-year-old Brisbane woman is recovering fast and can now run, and will compete in the finals of Miss World Australia in July

On Monday, Ms Campbell ran the longest distance since her accident - five kilometres - and hopes to keep improving her health now she's much more able and agile.

'My goal was 30 minutes and I was just eight seconds over that,' she said.

Ms Campbell also told of her experience when meeting the paramedics who rescued her at a CareFlight even she spoke at last week.

When she came face to face with Jeff, one of the men who attended to her accident, the 24-year-old said she was more emotional than expected and told of how comforting he was while she was being airlifted to hospital.

'I remember Jeff was squeezing my good hand, and he was really reassuring.'

Speaking of the upcoming Miss World Australia competition, whose core objective is 'beauty with a purpose' Ms Campbell revealed one of her hidden talents which she will showcase at the event in July.

After narrowly avoiding crippling life-long injuries, Ms Campbell is ready to strut her stuff for the crown

'I play the alto saxophone... But my last performance was at the valedictory,' she said.

Despite keeping busy with many other ventures, the adventurer said she's not rushing to jump back in to skydiving just yet.

'There’s a lot of other things I'm really focusing on, like finishing off my master’s degree.'

'But never say never, I was always aware of the risks... But now I've had a really bad landing if I had another one I don’t know how my body would cope.'
