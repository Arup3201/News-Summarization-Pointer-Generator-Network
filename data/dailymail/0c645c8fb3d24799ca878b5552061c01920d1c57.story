A guest at Silvio Berlusconi’s ‘bunga bunga’ parties has told an Italian court of her ‘shock and embarrassment’ at the former leader’s actions.

Melania Tumini, 26, described an evening at Berlusconi’s villa in August 2010 as ‘a gathering of whores’, adding: ‘The girls were allowing themselves to be touched by the prime minister.

‘Some of the women were dressed in nurses’ outfits while others were in police uniforms.

Accused: Nicole Minetti looks on during a break of a trial in Milan's court, where she is standing trial accused of recruiting women for Berlusconi's parties

'I kept saying I had  to go to the bathroom or go outside and smoke a cigarette. I was shocked and embarrassed by the scenes I saw.’  

Miss Tumini’s former friend Nicole Minetti is accused of recruiting women for the parties, while Berlusconi himself is accused of paying for sex with a belly-dancer when she was just 17.

Berlusconi, 74, is said to have invited dozens of models and TV wannabes to his home where they stripped off and performed erotic pole dances for him and two of his sidekicks.

The women were paid with cash, jewellery and cars with those who chose to stay the night being paid even more, according to earlier witnesses.

Miss Tumini, 26, gave a graphic account of the sordid scenes at Berlusconi’s villa.

She
 told the Milan hearing that Miss Minetti, 26, whose mother is British, 
joined in enthusiastically at the parties stripping off and dancing semi
 naked in front of Berlusconi at the party in the basement of his villa.

'The girls were touching themselves, touching each other and allowing themselves to be touched by the prime minister. He was touching their bottoms, their breasts and in between their legs.

'Nicole had a shirt and white culottes. The women were more undressed than dressed.    

When she was asked by prosecutors if the parties were ‘burlesque’ as Berlusconi had described them last month Miss Tumini said: ’No' before confirming a telephone transcript in which she had told friends: ’The parties were like a gathering of whores.’

Miss Minetti is accused of recruiting women for Berlusconi’s parties along with two others, showbuisness agent Lele Mora, 55, and TV news anchorman Emilio Fede, 80.

Claims: Dancer Karima El Mahroug of Morocco, who was allegedly paid by Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi for sex

Miss Tumini also added that when she left the party at Berlusconi’s villa at Arore near Milan, he had given her a CD of his latest album of love songs and four 500 Euro banknotes.

In a separate and ongoing trial Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with a minor, belly dancer Karima El Mahroug, who was just 17 at the time of the parties.

In Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman below the age of 18 for sex is seen as underage prostiution and punishable by up to three years in jail.

Both deny any wrong doing and Berlusconi has insisted the parties were simply elegant dinners where there was ‘eating, talking and dancing’.

Both trials have been adjourned until later this month.
