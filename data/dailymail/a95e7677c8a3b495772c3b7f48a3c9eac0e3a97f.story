She should have been walking down the aisle, but instead Caroline Wozniacki will be running through the streets of New York.

The 24-year-old tennis star announced she will be running the New York marathon this November at a time that had been scheduled for her wedding with Rory McIlroy.

The former world number one made the announcement earlier today and said she will run with Olympic silver medalist and Boston marathon winner Meb Keflezighi.

If she completes the race, Wozniacki will join an elite list of sportsmen and women to have run the 26.2 mile course during their professional careers.

That group includes disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong, who competed before he made his infamous Tour de France comeback in 2007.

Despite topping the world rankings for over a year at one stage, the Danish star has never actually won a major. She made the final of the 2009 US Open but was beaten in starlight sets by Kim Clijsters.
