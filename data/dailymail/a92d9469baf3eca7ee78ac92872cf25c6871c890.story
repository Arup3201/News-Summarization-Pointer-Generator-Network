Five American military personnel were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan last night on the deadliest day for US forces so far this year.

NATO officials said that initial reports suggest that there was no enemy activity in the area at the time of the crash outside Kandahar city in the south of the country and that an investigation has been launched into how it happened.

Two US special forces operations personnel were shot dead in an attack by an Afghan policeman in eastern Afghanistan earlier yesterday taking the day's death toll to seven.

In a separate incident Monday, U.S. forces shot at an Afghan truck, center, killing two passengers and injuring another on the road between Kabul and Bagram, Afghanistan

Major Adam Wojack, a NATO spokesman in Afghanistan, said that all five people killed in the helicopter crash had been aboard the UH-60 Black Hawk and that no one on the ground was killed.

The crash is the deadliest since last August when a helicopter crashed during a firefight in a remote area of the Kandahar province which saw seven Americans and four Afghans killed.

In March last year 12 Turkish soldiers and four Afghan civilians died in a helicopter crash and in 2011 30 American troops were killed when a Chinook helicopter was shot down in Wardak province.

The latest deaths take the number of Americans killed in Afghanistan so far this year to 12.

Last year, 297 US military service personnel were killed in the country, according to Associated Press.

The earlier 'insider' attack by an Afghan policeman yesterday had taken place in Wardak province in the east of the country, according to US officials.

The attacker is said to have stood up in a police pick up truck, grabbed a machine gun and opened fire.

As well as the two US servicemen that were killed, four others were injured.

The Taliban later claimed responsibility for that attack in a text message sent by spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.

In a separate incident on Monday, Afghan officials said U.S. troops shot and killed two Afghan civilians as their truck was approaching an American convoy on the road between Kabul and Bagram.

Six Afghan civilians were also killed in insurgent attacks yesterday according to the Interior Ministry.

Four died when a tractor hit a roadside bomb in Helmand province and two women were killed when a mortar hit their house.Â
