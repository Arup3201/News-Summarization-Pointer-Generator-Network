The future of male fertility treatment may lie with synthetic sperm, a new study claims.

Canadian scientists say they have pinpointed the protein required to kick-start the fertilisation process - and now believe they can re-create it in a lab.

The researchers, from Queen's University, say a synthetic version of the protein - known as PAWP - could improve the diagnoses and treatment of male infertility.

Male infertility could be treated with a synthetic version of a protein required to kick-start the fertilisation process, known as PAWP

In particular, it could help with cases where a man's sperm is unable to bond with the egg to form an early embryo.

At least one in six couples now need medical help to have a baby - and for 
half of them, the problem is the result of poor sperm quality.

It
 is believed the trend is linked to diet, lifestyle, exposure chemicals and possibly even tight underwear.

A large French study in 2012 found that sperm counts are falling at an alarming rate - up to 38 per cent in a decade - with diet and lifestyle largely to blame.

And a Spanish study published early last year found that even in young men, sperm concentration 
fell by an average of two per cent a year - and could soon hit levels 
where fertility is compromised.

Commenting on the new study, research leader Dr Richard Oko, said: 'Even in a synthetic form, the PAWP protein can help trigger the fertilisation process.

'PAWP is able to induce embryo development in human eggs in a fashion similar to the natural triggering of embryo development by the sperm cell during fertilisation,' he said.

Most human infertility treatments are now done by injecting a single sperm directly into an egg

Therefore, Dr Oko believes supplementation of human sperm with PAWP protein could be used to improve the success rate of infertility treatments in the future.

The average success rate of one fertility treatment cycle is only 37 per cent, according to figures from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's.

This low success rate may be due to a variety of factors - including the sperm cell being unable to kick-start fertilisation and trigger embryo development upon egg entry.

The research was published in the the FASEB Journal.
