A seventh grade girl has testified before a Federal judge for her right to compete on the boys' wrestling team at her school.

Audriana Beattie, 12, from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, told the court on Wednesday: 'It doesn't matter that I'm a girl, because I'm just as good as [the boys].'

She also said the sport has helped her overcome being bullied in the past. 'I can take my anger and use it, but not in a mean way, and do good,' she explained in her 40-minute testimony.

Members of the Pennsylvania Line Mountain School Board countered that letting her play on the boys' team would put her in physical danger, and that allowing body contact between boys and girls could make for awkward situations.

In their federal lawsuit, Audriana's parents are arguing that the school's ban on co-ed competition in contact sports is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

What's more, Audriana has been wrestling against both boys and girls since the third grade and had a 5-3 record last year; four of those wins were against boys.

But school board members say keeping boys and girls separated - especially in a sport like wrestling - is a necessity for several reasons.

Board member Lauren Hackenburg asserted: 'I think it sends mixed messages. It's inconsistent to teach male students that it's fine to be aggressive and pin women down during a sport.'

And Ron Neidig, another board member, testified that he is worried having a girl on the team will put the boys in an awkward and uncomfortable position.

'If they win, they've beaten a girl; if they lose, they are harassed by their teammates for being beaten by a girl,' he said.

'I've been bullied in the past, and wrestling helps me get over it. I can take my anger and use it, but not in a mean way'

He added that he has seen Audriana crying after losing a match against a boy. 'It ended quickly. When the match was over, she was upset and looked to be in pain,' he recounted.

Audriana asserted, however, that it's not out of the ordinary for competitors - including male competitors - to be upset after losing a match.

'I did cry. It's normal. I've seen a lot of boys cry and throw a fit and throw their headgear on the ground,' she explained. 'I wasn't hurt or in pain. It was just a matter of being emotional.'

According to the Daily Item, school board President Troy Laudenslager argued that there are also 'sexual considerations' that come into play in their current policy.

He explained that 'it's just not appropriate for males and females to be touching in such a way, particularly at ages 12 to 15, when hormones are just starting to kick in'.

He cited a specific wrestling move, where 'you're supposed to stick your face in the girl's chest. Anywhere else you would be suspended,' he said.

The school has said they would be willing to sponsor a girls' team if there is enough interest.

A final decision is not likely to be made until early December; until then, Judge Matthew Brann has issued a temporary restraining order allowing Audriana to wrestle with the boys' team.
