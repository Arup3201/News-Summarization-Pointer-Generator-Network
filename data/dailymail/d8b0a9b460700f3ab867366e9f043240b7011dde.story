In a rescue mission worthy of one of the action films that made him famous, Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe had to be saved by the U.S. Coast Guard after he and a friend got lost while kayaking in the waters of Long Island.

The 48-year-old was kayaking with a friend and launched from Cold Spring Harbor Saturday afternoon on the Long Island Sound, according to U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Robert Swieciki.

The actor, who famously starred in the naval action film Master and Commander, confirmed the incident via Twitter by thanking his rescuers and joking around with his friend who was lost with him at sea. He called it a 'great adventure, eh'.

Tricky area: Crowe and his friend set out from Cold Spring Harbor and eventually beached near Huntington Bay, nearly 10 miles away, when they saw a coast guard and called out for help

As it got dark, the two got lost and 
eventually headed for shore, beaching their kayaks in Huntington Bay, 
nearly 10 miles east from where they had set out.

The U.S. Coast Guard was patrolling the area, and heard Crowe call out to them from the shore around 10pm, Swieciki said.

The 'Gladiator' actor and his friend, who Swieciki didn't recognize, paddled over to the boat. The Coast Guard officers pulled them up and, along with their kayaks, gave them a ride to Huntington Harbor.

'He just needed a little bit of help, he just got a little lost,' Swieciki said. 'It wasn't really a rescue, really, more of just giving someone a lift.'

Swieicki said no one was injured, and the two men were wearing life vests. He said the actor, who was grateful and friendly, seemed like he was a fairly experienced kayaker.

Crowe sent a Twitter message about 1.30am Sunday thanking the officers, and saying he was out on the water four and a half hours.

Not his first time: Crowe has been seen kayaking in Sydney Harbor in the past, (pictured in 2003)

'Thanks to Seth and the boys from the US Coast Guard for guiding the way...4 hrs 30 mins, 7m(11.2km),' he wrote.

Later, he wrote: 'not lost,we knew where exactly where we were, paddling around from csh into wind, we ran out of day. Grand adventure eh @chris_feather ?'

Crowe is a noted kayaker, who has been photographed paddling around Sydney Harbor in his native Australia.

Crowe is on Long Island filming a new movie called 'Noah' in Oyster Bay. The biblical epic, the plot of which involves the actor leading his family to safety via a large arc, is directed by Darren Aronofsky and scheduled for release in 2014.

Crowe won an Academy Award for best actor for his role as a Roman soldier called Maximus in 'Gladiator.'
