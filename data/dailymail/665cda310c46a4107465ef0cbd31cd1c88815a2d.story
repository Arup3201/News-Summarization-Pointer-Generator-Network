A shocking video has emerged showing a young girl being egged on by teenagers to attack another child in a New York park.

The footage, which is a little over two minutes and half long, was uploaded to the video sharing website YouTube.

The video makes for difficult viewing as two young girls - who appear to be no older than ten - stand off against each other as onlookers encourage them to fight.

Stand off: Two young girls - who appear to be no older than 10 - are shouted encouragement to fight in a New York park

'Slap her!' The girl in the white puffa jacket then hits the other after being told to hit her by older girls

One of the girls, who is wearing a white puffa jacket and pink trousers is then told to slap the other child who is wearing a black puffa jacket.

The teenagers - who may be older siblings, girls at school or even parents - then accuse the girl in the black puffa jacket of 'not playing fair before' and telling the other girl to 'just slap her'.

As the girl in the black puffa jacket stands her ground, the other does as she is told and shoves her twice before slapping her on the face.

The older people in the background then scream on more encouragement, shouting: 'Whoop her ass. Just do it. Punch her. Harder'.

The young girl in the white puffa jacket then grabs the other and spins her round as the teenagers cheer and shout: 'Yes, yes, slap her harder'.

One then instructs: 'The hair, the hair', and the girl in the white jacket grabs her young opponent's locks.

They continue to grapple while being cheered on until the girl in the black puffa escapes the other's grip.

She then appears to be crying as she shouts at the group who are laughing as they film the whole incident: 'I'm not playing. It's not funny'.

The girl goes to grab her bag and is surrounded by the group as they continue to taunt her. The video then ends.

The footage has been sent to NYC's Administration for Children's Services who are currently reviewing it.
