An unemployed man who refused a request from his bed-bound mother to leave his room and walk downstairs to turn off a light in their home attacked his brother in a row over his lifestyle.

Shane Spong, 26, phoned his brother, Craig, who lived some distance away, and asked him to come over to the house to perform the tiny task, Guildford Crown Court heard.

But when the outraged brother arrived at the premises he got into a furious row with the defendant over his lackadaisical lifestyle.

Guildford Crown Court heard how Shane Spong called his brother when he couldn't be bothered to turn out a light

And in the confrontation that followed, Shane picked up a kitchen knife and lashed out at his sibling with it on June 10 this year.

Craig suffered a cut on his head - and Mr Spong ended up under arrest.

The defendant, a former driver, narrowly avoided being jailed after pleading guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm.

Judge Christopher Critchlow expressed astonishment over the incident.

The court heard how Shane Spong spent lots of his time on the internet

He said: 'If the defendant had only got up to turn off the light, none of this would have happened'.

Ruby Selva, prosecuting, said that Spong lived with his mother, who was confined to bed.

She said: 'The defendantâ€™s mother called out for the defendant to switch a downstairs light off which had been left on'.

She said: 'Instead, he called up his brother to come over to switch the light off.'

Ms Selva told how Craig arrived at the property and there was an argument between the two of them.

She said that Shane stormed into the kitchen, of the house in Guildford, Surrey and reappeared holding a knife in his right hand.

Craig suffered a wound to his head, telling police officers later: 'He hit me on the head with the blade'.

The Court heard that Shane told his injured brother: 'You used to hit me before. How do you like it?'

Later the defendant insisted that he had never intended to hurt his brother, but had acted in self defence after being assaulted.

The court was told that the victim described his brother as anti-social adding: 'He lives in his bedroom and online'.

Studying papers on the case Judge Critchlow said that the defendant appeared to blame his brother, and didn't seem to accept much responsibility for what happened.

The Judge said that the use of a knife was an aggravating feature of the case.

'It is a very serious offence. It could have had fatal consequences.'

The court was told that Shane had no previous convictions.

Mr Spong was sentenced to a 12 month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to perform 120 hours unpaid work for the community.

Judge Critchlow warned him: 'I hope you realise how close you came today to going through that door to prison'.

He added: 'There must be no further fights between you and your brother - with or without weapons'.
