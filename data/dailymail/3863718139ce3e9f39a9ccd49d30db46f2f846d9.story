The Australian Government is looking at joining the U.S. in 'humanitarian airdrops' over northern Iraq, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says.

It comes as the US airforce launched attacks on Saturday night on militants in the Middle East region where tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - were surrounded by Islamic State fighters who were threatening to kill them.

'We've been asked to consider participation in humanitarian airdrops,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Sydney.

'This is a potential humanitarian disaster.'

Islamic State is an extremist terror organisation, which is an off-shoot group of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda.

Two of Australia's C-130 Hercules aircraft based in the United Arab Emirates could possibly be used to assist in drops of food, water and other humanitarian supplies on Mount Sinjar, where 40,000 Iraqis are trapped.

Australia will be ready to assist within days should it be called to action.

'We are looking to assist as quickly as we can,' Mr Abbott said.

The prime minister said it was important Australia join international partners on helping stifle a potentially large-scale humanitarian disaster.

He warned of the 'medieval barbarism' of the terrorist group Islamic State, formerly known as ISIL or ISIS in its efforts to set up a 'terrorist state'.

'This is designed to protect civilians from a murderous onslaught,' Mr Abbott said.

Mr Abbott also dismissed reports Australian warships could be used to allow American commanders to launch missile strikes.

'There's been no discussions along those lines whatsoever,' he said.

It comes as the former Chief of the Australian Army, Peter Leahy, told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Abbott should feel compelled to act.

'As we look out from Australia, we can see chaos and unprecedented savagery in some of these lands, particularly in the ISIS groups in Iraq and Syria,' Mr Leahy said.

'How long can we sit back and watch this before we decide out of morality that we have to do something about this?'
