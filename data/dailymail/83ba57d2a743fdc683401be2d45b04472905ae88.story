Beaten up: Jamie McDonald, 27, was attacked on New Year's Eve

A British adventurer attempting a gruelling charity run across Canada dressed as a superhero has been assaulted and robbed.

Jamie McDonald, 27, was attacked on New Year's Eve in the ski resort of Banff, Alberta, and his so-called 'man bag' containing computer hard drive, camera and wallet was taken.

Mr McDonald, who suffered blows to the head in the incident, said the bag could be worth a 'million dollars in fundraising' and has launched an appeal on social networking sites to get the bag back.

Writing on Twitter, he said: 'So I just got beat up, I couldn't give a s**t but my MAN BAG that got left behind, has my world behind it. Video footage and more....

'This is a call out, anyone in #Banff, hand over a bag that is the difference in changing this world. Thank you so much!

'Thank you all for your support. I just want to say that all that can be done is being done and I'm OK physically, just a bit shaken up.'

Mr McDonald later posted on Facebook: 'Putting a call out - my bag was taken on New Year's Eve in Banff, everything I own.

'Including my hard drive, camera, and my wallet and all my positions. Please RT & help find it, the bag could be worth a million dollars in fundraising, please help.'

He later added: 'I just want to say I'm OK physically, shaken up but OK. Finding my bag is the most important thing and everything that can be being done is being done.

Mr McDonald, from Gloucester, is less than 600 miles from becoming the first person to run across Canada without a support team

'Thank you to everybody for your support and shout outs, let's hope it turns up tomorrow.'

Mr McDonald, from Gloucester, is less than 600 miles from becoming the first person to run across Canada without a support team but is on the toughest leg of his route as he makes his way across the Rocky Mountains.

The 5,000 mile coast-to-coast run is the equivalent of more than 200 marathons in 275 days, and involves Mr McDonald sleeping by the side of the road, or relying on strangers' generosity as he undertakes the challenge.

Mr McDonald's coast-to-coast challenge began in St John's, Labrador, in March and will finish in Vancouver after passing through mountain ranges, national parks and along highways.

Originally billed as the 'British Forrest Gump', he is running dressed as comic superhero The Flash after a public vote on Twitter and Facebook chose a costume for him.

Mr McDonald, who suffered from a debilitating immune deficiency and potentially fatal spinal condition syringomyelia as a child, spent the first nine years of his life in and out of children's hospitals and is running to raise funds for SickKids Foundation, Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity and the Pied Piper Appeal.

He has also recently won two major awards having been voted male runner of the year and won the Golden Shoe from Running Magazine.

Mr McDonald plans to be back in the UK ahead of the Adventure Travel Show in London which he is due to speak at on January 26.

He already holds a world record for static cycling after he pedalled for 265 hours straight - the equivalent of 11 days - last year.

Mr McDonald accomplished the feat just two weeks after cycling 14,000 miles from Bangkok to Gloucester, his home town. During that trip he says he was shot at, arrested and slept rough.

He has been inspired by Canadian fundraiser and amputee Terry Fox, 22, who lost his battle against cancer in 1981 before completing the cross-country run after 3,339 miles.

His foundation has since raised more than 500 million Canadian dollars (Â£285m) for cancer research.

Throughout his attempt, he is keeping supporters updated on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, where he posts videos documenting his efforts.
