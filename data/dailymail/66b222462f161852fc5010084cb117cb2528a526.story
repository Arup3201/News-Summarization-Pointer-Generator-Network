It took Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney just 25 seconds to race from his own penalty to score his side's opening goal against rivals Liverpool.

Rooney helped his defensive team-mates close down Raheem Sterling inside David de Gea's penalty box before taking up his regular position in attack.

The Englishman was able to put his side in the lead just 25 seconds later when he latched on to a cross by Antonio Valencia.
