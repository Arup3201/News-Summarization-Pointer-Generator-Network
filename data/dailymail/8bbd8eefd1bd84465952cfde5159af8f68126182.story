For the first time ever, celebrities are being replaced with 'everyday heroes' to take part in a special series of Strictly Come Dancing.

Six men and women from across the UK - including a Royal Marine who joked 'Well, there go my dancing days' after losing his leg in a blast in Afghanistan - will take a turn under the glitterball for the Comic Relief episodes.

The first People's Strictly, from which any cash raised by public voting will go to charity, will air on BBC1 on February 25 at 9pm. 

The People's Strictly contestants are ready for their close up, (L-R) Michael Pattie, Anna Kennedy OBE, Cassidy Little, Heather Parsons, Phillip Barnett and Trishna Bharadia 

The contestants - dubbed 'everyday heroes' - were chosen out of 11,000 hopefuls who all have inspirational stories.

Viewers will be able to watch, and vote for, Canadian-born Lance Corporal Cassidy Little, a former Marine medic, who despite losing his right leg in an explosion in 2011 went on to help other Marines through rehab, performing with partner Natalie Lowe.

Buckinghamshire resident Trishna Bharadia, who is dancing with Aljaz Scorjanec, suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and has campaigned tirelessly to help other people with the chronic illness.

Cornish man Phil Barnett, who set up the children's youth theatre group Kidz R Us, which has helped more than 2,000 children in the area, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds, will be dancing with Janette Manrara.

Anna Kennedy OBE, who will be pairing with Robin Windsor, set up schools for those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders after discovering the lack of provisions for her two sons who suffer from ASDs.

Heather Parsons who, after contracting a flesh eating bug whilst on a skiing holiday and nearly dying, set up a charity to help those in intensive care and their families dancing with Ian Waite.

And Michael Pattie, from Dumfries, who after tragically losing his son to Meningitis has raised more than £300,000 for charities to help others who contract the disease. Michael will be dancing with Strictly favourite Aliona Vilani.

There will be a four-part special show which will follow the contestants in their daily lives and then see them go behind the scenes at Strictly. 

In the fourth episode, the contestants will face a dance off in front of the public, and will be all vying to win the much coveted glitter ball trophy.

The show will be presented by the regular hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman and the lucky contestants will get to travel around the UK and Europe learning the origins of their dances. 

Here's who to look out for...

Marome Medic Cassidy looks smart in his uniform as he gears up to take part in The People's Strictly

Name: Cassidy Little 

Age: 33

From: Peterborough (born in Canada)

Hero Qualities: Cassidy is a Marine Medic who helped other Marines through rehab, despite his own injuries

Dance Partner: Natalie Lowe 

Lance Corporal Cassidy Little is a former Royal Marine medic, who lost his right leg below the knee during a tour of Afghanistan in the summer of 2011. An Improvised Explosive Device was triggered, resulting in three fatalities and five seriously injured Marines including Cassidy. Despite his own horrific injuries Cassidy selflessly attempted to tend to his colleagues on the ground after the attack.

Following the incident, Cassidy spent a week in an induced coma, and two months in hospital. He then undertook intensive rehabilitation with his fellow injured Marines, who commented that it was Cassidy’s optimism and sense of humour that helped them through an incredibly tough time. Major Steve McCulley, who spent more than two years in rehab with Cassidy, stated: 'Every single seriously injured service person goes through very dark periods and were it not for Cassidy, those dark periods would have been far longer and far harder for many to deal with, me included.'

And it wasn’t just Cassidy’s upbeat attitude that helped his colleagues – but his love of dance too. Previously an avid dancer - and with a degree in music and dance - Cassidy taught fellow Marine JJ Chalmers, how to Waltz whilst out in Afghanistan, so JJ could impress his fiancée at their first dance for their wedding. When Cassidy was being airlifted to Camp Bastian following the incident, JJ said Cassidy joked: 'There go my dancing days!' - But how wrong he was!

Campaigner Trishna looks nervous at the prospect of dancing with her professional partner Aljaz Scorjanec

Name: Trishna Bharadia  

Age: 35

From: Buckinghamshire

Hero Qualities: Multiple Sclerosis and disability fundraiser and awareness campaigner

Dance Partner: Aljaz Scorjanec 

Trishna was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008, at the age of 28. She has since worked tirelessly to help and support others with MS, putting aside her own health issues to help raise awareness and inspire others with the illness. She has worked particularly hard within the Asian community, where she feels that disability is often hidden away and discriminated against, as well as with young people who have been diagnosed with MS.

Trishna volunteers with several MS charities, including the MS Society, Asian MS and the MS Trust and in 2013 she was named ‘Volunteer of the Year’ at the MS Society Awards. As well as fundraising, Trishna is also Editor of the Asian MS quarterly newsletter; writes for MS and disability-awareness magazines, blogs and speaks at both local events and large pharmaceutical conferences about MS – something which was initially very hard for her due to her shyness and fear of public speaking. She is keen to put a ‘face’ to MS, rather than being viewed as a statistic. 

Hailing from St Ives Phil set up a Youth Theatre Company called Kidz R Us 

Name: Phil Barnett  

Age: 54

From: St Ives

Hero Qualities: Founder of Youth Theatre Company, Kidz R Us

Dance Partner: Janette Manrara 

Twenty years ago, hairdresser and amateur-dramatics enthusiast Phil gathered a small group of local kids for a one-off concert in aid of charity Save The Children. Following its success, he decided to give up his full-time hairdressing business and set up ‘Kidz R Us’, a Youth Theatre Company for six to 24 year olds in St Ives.

Through practical engagement in the performing arts, the company aims to build confidence in its young members, providing them with a hobby, a goal and a safe family environment. Since it started, Phil estimates that 2,000 children have been through its doors, half of those being from disadvantaged backgrounds. They have also raised more than £2m through their 50-plus shows and events.

Anna's two sons were both diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorders as young children and were turned away from many mainstream schools 

Name: Anna Kennedy OBE 

Age: 54

From: Uxbridge, London

Hero Qualities: Set up schools and support for people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders

Dance Partner: Robin Windsor 

Anna’s two sons, Patrick, 24 and Angelo, 20, were both diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorders as young children. The severity of their condition meant that they were turned away from 26 local mainstream schools, as they couldn’t cater for their individual needs. Both boys were finally offered just five hours of home tuition per week.

Anna decided something had to be done for her boys, and with the help of her husband Sean, took on the challenge of founding a school themselves. They relentlessly fundraised and re-mortgaged their home to raise the £627,000 needed, and in 1999 The Hillingdon Manor School finally opened its doors in their home town. It started out with just 19 pupils but has since grown to over 150, and is now the largest school of its kind for Autistic children in Europe.

Anna has since set up another specialist school, an autism awareness charity and a respite home for adults. She provides training for the NSPCC and Childline and also runs various other fundraising and awareness events throughout the year. 

Heather Parsons is 53 and set up a charity to help support those in intensive care and their families 

Name: Heather Parsons  

Age: 53

From: Southampton

Hero Qualities: Set up a charity to support intensive care patients and their families

Dance Partner: Ian Waite 

In 2002, Heather was on a skiing holiday with her son Will, who was seven at the time, when she contracted Necrotising Fasciitis - a flesh-eating bug - that left her in intensive care. Her body’s immune system did not fight the infection and her organs began to fail. Her kidneys stopped working, she suffered a heart attack and her breathing had to be supported. She was in a coma for two weeks, hospitalised for six, and underwent 15 operations. At one point her family were told that her chance of survival was just 30%.

When she woke from her coma, it was the thought of Will at home that helped Heather to pull through, but following her release from hospital, it wasn’t easy for her. Convinced that intensive care patients and their friends and families needed greater emotional support upon recovery, Heather left her job and re-mortgaged her house in order to set up the charity ‘Where There’s A Will’ to help to provide this support. Since then she has been volunteering her time daily at the Intensive Care Unit at Southampton General Hospital offering what she calls, 'TLC; tea, listening and compassion'.

Heather and son Will recently also developed an app to help ICU patients who can’t speak to communicate with staff. This is now in medical use. 

After losing his son Dave to Meningitis Michael has tirelessly fundraised for the Meningitis Research Foundation 

Name: Michael Pattie 

Age: 57

From: Dumfries

Hero Qualities: Meningitis Research Foundation fundraiser and awareness campaigner

Dance Partner: Aliona Vilani 

In 1999 Michael tragically lost his 13-year-old son Dave to Meningitis. Since his death, Michael has been tirelessly fundraising for the Meningitis Research Foundation and has raised over £300,000 – some of which contributed towards the development of a ground-breaking new Meningitis B vaccine, available on the NHS.

The majority of this £300,000 has been raised through an idea that came to Michael in front of the TV ten years ago: putting on local Strictly Come Dancing events. These fundraisers, called ‘Strictly for Charity’ have now been running for a decade and, as well as generating funds, have provided a vehicle for the Dumfries community to come together.

Michael also leads outreach and awareness events; speaking at local schools and parent toddler groups to teach people the Meningitis symptoms to look out for. Michael’s contribution to the Meningitis Research Foundation has been praised by Scotland’s manager for MRF, Mary Millar, who says: 'Michael’s work has saved lives and he is the best fundraiser we have ever had in Scotland. We are incredibly grateful to him.' In 2013, Michael was named Scottish Charity Champion.
