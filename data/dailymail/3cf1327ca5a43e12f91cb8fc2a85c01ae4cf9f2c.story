Manchester United slipped up to Swansea while Arsenal were poor in their win against Crystal Palace, so their are several lesser-known gems in this team.

Formation: 4-4-1-1 

GK: Hugo Lloris, Tottenham (vs West Ham), 8

Matt Barlow at Upton Park 

Hugo Lloris was inspired in the Spurs goal, making two brilliant second-half saves to deny Stewart Downing, the second shortly before Eric Dier’s winner.

RB: Eric Dier, Tottenham (vs West Ham), 7

Matt Barlow at Upton Park 

A clean sheet as part of a 10-man team at Upton Park would have been enough for young debutant Eric Dier, but he also had the audacity to score the winner. The youngster, who started at the heart of defence, stormed forward from right-back to net the only goal in added time.

CB: Ashley Williams, Swansea (vs Manchester United), 7.5

Adam Crafton at Old Trafford

Ashley Williams was superb in defence at Old Trafford, highlighted in the fact United's only goal came from a set-piece. The Welshman, who signed a contract extension in the summer, looks set to have another stellar season as captain in South Wales.

CB: James Chester, Hull (vs QPR) 7.5

Sami Mokbel at Loftus Road

Nets the winner and helps his team to a clean sheet, it can't get much better than that for a defender. Chester nipped in front of Rio Ferdinand for his goal as Steve Bruce's side got their season up and running.

LB: Andrew Robertson, Hull (vs QPR), 8

Sami Mokbel at Loftus Road

Robertson was a constant thorn in QPR's side down the left-hand side for Hull, bombing foward from wing-back. The Scottish debutant provided many crosses in the 1-0 win, and also cleared Steven Caulker's bullet header off the line.

RM: Steven Naismith, Everton (vs Leicester), 7.5

Rob Harris at the King Power Stadium

Another energetic performance from Naismith, who covered the most amount of ground (7.7 miles), but also showed fine technique for his goal. Volleying home off the bar to put Everton 2-1 up, the winger will be central to Roberto Martinez's plans this season.

Great start: Steven Naismith started how he finished last season with a goal against Leicester

CM: Lee Cattermole, Sunderland (vs West Brom), 7.5

Craig Hope at the Hawthorns

He may have scored just twice in 103 Premier League appearances for Sunderland, but Cattermole netted the goal of the day in the 2-2 draw. Five minutes had passed before the defensive midfielder's shot from long range flew past Ben Foster into the top corner.

CM: Craig Gardner, West Brom (vs Sunderland), 7.5

Craig Hope at the Hawthorns

Gardner excelled against his former club on Saturday. Constant energy in midfield gave Alan Irvine just the platform he was looking for. Supplied Saido Berahino's second goal with a wonderfully floated cross.

LM: Gylfi Sigurdsson, Swansea (vs Manchester United), 8

Adam Crafton at Old Trafford

Not many players can claim to be a match winner at Old Trafford, but Gylfi Sigurdsson capped a fine performance with a neat finish on Saturday. The Icelandic midfielder, in his second spell at the Swans, summoned Van Gaal to an humiliating opening day defeat.

Shock: Manchester United's start to the season was ruined by Swansea playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson

CF: Marouane Chamakh, Crystal Palace (vs Arsenal), 7.5

Jack Gaughan at the Emirates Stadium

Another man starting against his former club, the Moroccan played in an unfamiliar role on Saturday. Tasked with shutting down midfielders and stopping Arsenal finding their stride, Chamakh covered 7.2 miles at the Emirates Stadium, second behind Aaron Ramsey.

ST: Saido Berahino, West Brom (vs Aston Villa), 8

Craig Hope at the Hawthorns

We have an early frontrunner for the Golden Boot. Berahino was the only man to score more than once on Saturday, netting a penalty and a nice poacher's finish. Just a shame he wasn't the match winner.  

At the double: Saido Berahino was the star man on Saturday, netting two goals at the Hawthorns
