A Tennessee Titans football player has died aged just 25 after shooting himself while sitting in his car.

Wide receiver O.J. Murdock is the sixth NFL star to commit suicide in the last two years, a chilling trend which has sparked debate over the potential damage playing football can inflict on the brain.

The player was found in his car outside his old high school in Tampa, Florida around 8.30 on Monday morning, in critical condition after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Doctors at Tampa General Hospital were unable to save him and he died just over two hours later.

Murdock had his whole life ahead of him, and faced the prospect of becoming a multi-millionaire through pursuing a sporting career.

At around 3.30am Murdock had sent a cryptic message to his Fort Hays State receivers coach Al McCray.

'It was like, "Coach, I appreciate everything you've done for me and my family,"' he told the Tampa Bay Times. 

'At the end of the text he said, "I apologise." I figured he's apologising because he texted me so early.'

Mr McCray said he had spoken to the 25-year-old just days before his death and that he had seemed in good spirits, excited about going to see his mother.

'The people in Hays [Kansas], gosh, they love him so much,' he added. 'If he wanted to run for mayor, he would've won in a landslide.' 

The coach continued: 'Our homecoming game his senior year, the fire marshal calls our athletic director to say: "Listen, we can't allow any more people to come into this game, we're at capacity." Our A.D. was like, "No, you're not. Let em in." That's just the impact that kid had here.

'It's hard, it really is because he was such a good kid. He was lazy in the classroom in high school, and of course he messed up at South Carolina, but you're talking about a kid who was on his mom's couch for two years.

'He got the grades he needed and he came up here and he had one dream, one goal: "I'm going to come out here and I'm going to play at a high level and I'll get to the National Football League." And the kid did it. He did it.'

Tragic: O.J. Murdock shot himself on Monday morning as he sat in his car

The 25-year-old star, who was single at the time of his death, signed with the Titans a year ago but tragically never played a game for the team. 

As a senior at Middleton High School in 2005, Murdock was rated the 10th-best wide receiver recruit in the nation by Rivals.com.

He signed with South Carolina, but 
played in only four games, making one catch, after redshirting his first
season. He was arrested for shoplifting at a Florida department store 
during that 2006 season and suspended.

Murdock transferred to Pearl River 
Community College in Mississippi and then to Division II Fort Hays State
in Kansas. As a senior in 2010, he had 60 catches for 1,290 yards and 
12 touchdowns.

That earned him an invitation to the 
NFL scouting combine. After going undrafted, he was signed by the Titans
last summer but spent the entire 2011 season on injured reserve after 
hurting his right Achilles early in training camp.

The standout high school player 
missed Titans practice twice over the weekend for 'personal reasons', but
the club said they were stunned by his suicide. 

In
a statement they said: 'We are shocked and saddened to hear of 
O.J. Murdock’s death this morning,' the Titans said in a statement.

'In
his brief time here, a number of our players, coaches and staff had 
grown close to O.J., and this is a difficult time for them. 

'He spent the last year battling back 
from an Achilles injury as he prepared for this year’s training camp. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as they try to 
cope with this tragedy.'

Titans general manager Ruston Weber 
said: 'We were concerned initially when O.J. didn't report on the 27th. 
But we were able to make contact with him and he assured us everything 
was OK and he would be in here on Sunday. He didn't make it on Sunday.'

Wade Belak hanged himself in August 2011. In April Ray Easterling, a one-time Atlanta Falcons star, shot himself at home after struggling to cope with dementia

Murdock becomes the sixth former NFL star to kill himself in the past two years.

The NFL has found itself at the 
centre of several lawsuits, with the families of players who have killed
themselves claiming football-related brain injuries led to their 
deaths.

Three former NFL 
players - Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson - died of 
self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the past year and a half.

Wade
Belak hanged himself in August, although that is not believed to have 
been driven by brain damage. Murdock's name has not come up in the 
ongoing concussion debate and it is not yet known what drove him to suicide.

Easterling
and Duerson were found to have brain damage at the time of their deaths
and their families are among those suing the league over the long-term 
effects of concussions. Brain tissue from Seau has been released by his 
family for study.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is 
associated with cognitive and behavioural problems later in life and can
eventually cause dementia.

Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions.

In
recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including 
professional and college football players and pro hockey players.

Sufferers
can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and 
depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades 
later.

Dave Duerson: Two-time Super Bowl winner Dave Duerson shot himself in February 2011 after texting family members asking for his brain to be examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease.

Wade Belak: Former Nashville Predator Wade Belak was found dead in September 2011, having hanged himself in a Toronto hotel room.

Junior Seau: In May 2012 Junior Seau, of the San Diego Chargers, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. He was found by his girlfriend at his home in California.

Kurt Crain: The South Alabama associate head football coach, who once played in the NFL, shot himself in April 2012. He had had reportedly been suffering from a severe prostate infection.

Ray Easterling: Also in April Ray Easterling, a one-time Atlanta Falcons star, shot himself at home after struggling to cope with dementia.
