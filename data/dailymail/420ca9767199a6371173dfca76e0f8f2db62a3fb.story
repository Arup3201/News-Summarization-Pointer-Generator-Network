The boy screamed while blood dripped from just below his eye and his little brother started crying too while he apologised for what he’d done.

Tommy Gallagher, 12, was almost fatally shot by his nine-year-old brother Jamey with a BB gun at their home in Tampa Bay, Florida.

The brothers were only playing and thought the gun was broken and unloaded, but the pellet ended up getting lodged inside Tommy's brain.

Recovering: Tommy Gallagher, 12, was almost fatally shot by his nine-year-old brother Jamey with a BB gun at their home in Tampa Bay, Florida

Janice Gallagher heard Tommy’s screams on July 9 and ran upstairs to see blood dripping from his face, reported the St. Petersburg Times.

Jamey had found a BB gun in his closet and playfully fired it at his big brother, not realising that it was working and loaded.

Jamey was sobbing and hysterical, repeatedly saying: ‘I'm so sorry’. But Tommy tried to calm him, saying: ‘It's OK - I don't blame you’.

There was a small mark below Tommy’s left eye, but Mrs Gallagher did not believe a pellet had gone inside her son’s head.

Pellet: It had gone under his left eye, through his sinuses and become lodged in the back right side of his brain - and could have even killed him

However the next day he was having trouble moving his left leg and arm, and later had a headache, reported the St. Petersburg Times.

By the time Mrs Gallagher could get Tommy a doctor’s appointment he had stopped eating and needed help walking.

The doctor told them to get him to an emergency centre, where doctors amazingly found that the pellet was lodged inside his brain.

It had gone under his left eye, through his sinuses and become lodged in the back right side of his brain, reported the St. Petersburg Times.

On the mend: Tommy can still speak although he had problems moving his mouth and has moved his arm and leg since being admitted to the hospital

Long stay: Tommy, who described himself as 'so frustrated', could still be in hospital for months and is likely to miss the start of the next school year

Dr Richard Weibley, of St. Joseph's Children's Hospital in Tampa, said Tommy is ‘lucky’ to be alive and it was a ‘pretty unique situation’.

The pellet could have blinded him, penetrated an artery or even killed him. Doctors said it was lodged in an inoperable spot.

He can still speak although he had problems moving his mouth and has moved his arm and leg since being admitted to the hospital.

Tommy, who described himself as ‘so frustrated’, could still be in hospital for months and is likely to miss the start of the next school year.
