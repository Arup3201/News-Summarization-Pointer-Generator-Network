Mario Mandzukic meant business on Wednesday night.

Despite suffering with a broken nose, the Croat striker removed his protective face mask during Atletico Madrid's Champions League win against Juventus.

Loud cheers greeted Mandzukic's action as he tossed the mask to the side.

Atletico won the game 1-0 courtesy of an Arda Turan strike, while Mandzukic was locked in a battle with Juve defender Leonardo Bonucci.

After being caught by a flailing arm, Mandzukic ran to the touchline and took his mask off. Quite the opposite of shying away from a challenge, then.

Mandzukic is already somewhat of a cult hero at the Vicente Calderon, replacing Diego Costa up front for Diego Simeone's side.
