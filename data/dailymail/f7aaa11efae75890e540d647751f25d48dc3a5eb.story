The stress of the weekly shop can be the cause of a headache for most people.

But for Ed Miliband the contents of his shopping basket - and its cost - has become more than a question of simply what he buys and strikes at the heart of his ability to put himself on the side of cash-strapped families. 

First he flounded when put on the spot about how much he spends on a weekly shop. Now his claim to have a frugal grocery bill of as little as £70 has suffered a fresh blow, after it emerged he regularly spends £2.25 on an artisan loaf of bread and has his ‘assertive’ hair styled by a celebrity crimper.

Mr Miliband, who also bought a bunch of red roses from New Covent Garden Market, has faced questions - and some ridicule - about his own spending habits

Celebrity hairdresser Charlotte Cave has revealed how she tried to give Mr Miliband a more 'assertive' haircut, as it emerged he regularly spends £2.25 on a loaf of bread, £2 on coffee and £1 on a croissant from his local deli

Mr Miliband is today visiting 10 areas of England to highlight 10 pledges included in Labour’s ‘cost of living contract’. He will declare: ‘Vote Labour to make your family better off.’

The tour started early this morning with a stop at New Covent Garden Market, where he enjoyed a modest bacon sandwich and bought a large bunch of red roses.

But his attempt to appear to understand the difficulties cash-strapped voters face has been undermined by revelations about the contents of his shopping basket.

Neighbours claim to often see him popping into the Truffles delicatessen in Dartmouth Park.

He regularly buys himself a £2 cappuccino, a £2.25 loaf of bread and occasional treats himself to a £1 croissant, according to The Times.

Mr Miliband, who lives nearby with wife Justine and sons Sam and Daniel, is also a regular customer at Continental Provision Stores where he runs up a bill of around £15 on organic milk, fruit and vegetables.

Little wonder, then, that he seemed unsure what to say when grilled on the breakfast TV sofa about his own spending habits. 

Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband claimed the ‘cost-of-living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and I am determined we tackle it’.

Asked about the average weekly household grocery bill, Mr Miliband responded: ‘It depends on how much you are spending.’

Pressed on his own family's bill, Mr Miliband said: ‘We probably spend £70, £80 a week on groceries at least, probably more than that.

‘The point is that different families will have different costs that they face but what I am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many people.’

But TV presenter Susannah Reid took him to task for appearing out of touch.

She told him: ‘The average weekly bill for a family of four is more than £100. So you are going to be spending significantly more than £70 or £80.

‘People will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually talking about something but not in touch with reality.’

Official figures for 2012 show that a family of four spent on average £113.12 every week, rising to £165.48 when eating out was included.

Hairdresser Charlotte Cave, who has styled Lady Gaga, has revealed how she tried to give Ed Miliband a more 'assertive' haircut

All politicians want like a sprinkling of celebrity stardust.

Now it is emerged that Ed Miliband has had his hair cut by a celebrity crimper who has styled the likes of Lady Gaga, U2’s Bono and Coldplay’s Chris Martin.

Hairdresser Charlotte Cave has revealed how she gave the Labour leader a more ‘assertive’ style.

‘It's really nice: quite soft and very thick. I've run my hands through lots of politicians' hair, but his took me by surprise,’ she told The Times.

Miss Cave runs a salon in Clapham but is often called upon to style the stars. She first tackled the Miliband barnet in 2010, when asked to prepare him for an appearance on Question Time.

‘I moved his parting so it sat flatter and made his hair much more assertive, but I don't think he liked it very much.

‘I don't know if he felt it was too much like his brother's, but it's since gone a little bit floppy-haired toff. I think we had something very assertive there, but I think what he wants varies depending on how insecure he is.’   

Mr Miliband is such a fan of his local Indian restaurant that the menu declares it to be his favourite.

He has previously said his favourite meal is a Chinese - duck, spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken.

Mr Miliband also appeared uncomfortable when discussing his own circumstances.

He earns £139,000 as leader of the opposition, and his wife Justine is reported to earn £200,000-a-year as a lawyer. Their home is said to be worth more £2million.

Mr Miliband conceded: ‘I am relatively comfortably off, but what I know is that there are deep issues that need to be tackled.’

The Labour leader suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the Labour party leader at a battleground council.

His blunders were seized on by the Tories, who accused him of being a ‘champagne socialist’.

The interviews made for a day of woe 
for Mr Miliband as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for 
European and local council elections.

He has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years. 

He hopes to draw a line under interest in his own spending with a new focus on Labour policies ahead of local and European Parliament elections tomorrow.

He is embarking on a 10 visits - taking him from London to his Doncaster constituency via towns in the South East, East of England, East Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside. 

The Labour leader added: 'If I have heard one message most of all in this campaign, it is the depths of discontent about the way the country is run.

'The challenges go beyond this Government. And people are asking whether any political party can turn it round?

'Can anyone rebuild the link between a hard day's work and ordinary family finances?

'That link that used to be the foundation of our country's prosperity.

That used to guarantee the people of this country a decent life for them and their families.

'My answer is that Labour can and Labour will. People should vote Labour on Thursday to make Britain better than this. Vote Labour to make your family better off.' 

Labour has attempted to show that despite the economic recovery, ordinary people are not feeling better off.

Following the ITV interview yesterday morning, Mr Miliband attempted to correct his blunder, saying 
his overall shopping bill would  be ‘slightly higher’ than he  
suggested.

The correction backfired because he implied that the  £70 or 
£80 was for ‘basic fruit and vegetables’. 

Speaking
 on BBC Radio Oxford, he said: ‘Well, I said this morning  it was on the
 basic groceries, the basic fruit and vegetables, about £70 or £80 – the
 total shopping  bill was slightly higher than that, obviously.’

Mr
 Miliband’s day then got worse during an interview on BBC Radio 
Wiltshire in which he was shown to lack knowledge of local politicians. 

Ben Prater, the interviewer, asked him what he made of ‘Jim Grant’ without saying who he was.

Mr
 Miliband asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no 
idea who he was talking about, and asked the presenter to ‘enlighten’ 
him. 

In a toe-curling exchange, Mr Prater told him Mr Grant was the Labour leader on Swindon council.  Mr
 Miliband then blundered again by referring to Mr Grant as the leader of
 Swindon council, when in fact the council is controlled by 
Conservatives.

Flailing, Mr Miliband said: ‘I think he is doing a good job for Labour on the council.’ 

Tory
 MP Julian Smith said: ‘Ed Miliband has sealed his credentials as an out
 of touch champagne socialist who has no idea how hard-working people 
live.

'The Labour 
leader is the man without a plan, stumbling from opportunist gimmick to 
gimmick, with policies unravelling by  the day. Even his own MPs don’t 
trust him.’
