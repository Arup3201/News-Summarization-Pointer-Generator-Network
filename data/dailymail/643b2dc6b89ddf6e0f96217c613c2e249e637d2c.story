Germany prepared for their Group G opener against Portugal by training hard in Porto Seguro - with coach Joachim Low putting his players through their paces by getting them to weave in and out of giant dummies.

Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng and Bastian Schweinsteiger looked sharp and focused as they ran against resistant ropes and then took part in ball skills.

Low has an injury crisis in defence ahead of their opener on Monday and he could be forced to field four centre backs.

Unfamiliar: Jerome Boateng could be forced to play full back against Cristiano Ronaldo

Jerome Boateng and Benedikt Howedes are expected to play at full back, with Mats Hummels and Per Mertersacker partnering each other in the centre of defence.

Captain and right back Philipp Lahm is likely to start in midfield - a position for which he has excelled at club side Bayern Munich - although Low did not rule out the possibility of pushing Lahm back to full back and playing Boateng alongside Mertesacker in central defence.

Although Boateng has played full back before, he is more competent at centre back, as is Howedes who plays there for Schalke, and they would come up against Ballon D'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo on the flank.

At least one of the two is likely to deputise at full back after Marcel Schmelzer was ruled out of the World Cup with a knee injury.

His Borussia Dortmund team-mate Erik Durm replaced him in the squad but he is in the process of being re-trained as a defender, having started out as a striker, and so is unlikely to be risked.
