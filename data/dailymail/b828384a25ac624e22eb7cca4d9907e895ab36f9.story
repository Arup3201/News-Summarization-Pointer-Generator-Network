Two months ago, more than 25 square miles of Somerset was under water in some of the worst flooding the area has ever seen.

Around 7,000 homes were inundated with dirty water around the UK as transport networks were crippled and villages were cut off by the relentless, rising waters.

The army was called in to the deal with the disaster as authorities struggled to get a grip on the unfolding crisis in January and February this year.

At one point, rescue services were pumping out more than 7.3million tonnes of water a day, with insurers later estimating the disaster caused more than Â£1billion worth of damage.

The Environment Agency is set to begin a Â£5.8million plan to clear an eight-kilometre stretch of the rivers Tone and Parrett next week, as locals in Somerset try to put their lives back together.

Three months after the deluge first 
began, astonishing new aerial photos now show how the floods have now 
subsided, leaving behind muddy fields and streets.

Before: Homeowner Sam Notaro was dubbed King Canute after he turned his house in Moorland, Somerset into a million-pound island, pictured here surrounded by waters which run to the horizon

After: Mr Notaro has finally got green fields around his home once again and, taking in the view this week, said: 'It looks much better now, doesn't it? The view is certainly better now than it was.'

Before: Father-of-two Mr Notaro kept the worst of the flood waters at bay with a seven-foot-high mud dam he constructed with diggers around his four-bedroom home

After: Mr Notaro was able to flatten the dam this week and is in the process of burying the dirty soil. He said: 'It was a strange tearing it down. We just can't believe it was necessary to have it that high at any point.'

Before: An aerial photo of a train making its way along the water-surrounded track near the village of Moorland became one of the iconic images of the crisis

After: At the place where the waters once rose at an astonishing 5mm every hour, new images show the line, part of the main route to Devon and Cornwall, now surrounded on both sides by just boggy fields

Before: Waters rose to engulf the entire height of the ground floor of some homes the village of Moorland, which was one of the worst affected areas and saw more than 50,000 sandbags put down

After: Residents are now attempting to clear up the mess the receding floods have left behind after scores of volunteers moved in to clear away the makeshift defences. One victim said some people are only now returning to the village, which has been 'like a ghost town for weeks'

Before: The ruined church at the top of the mound at Barrow Mump looked out over a vast expanse of flood water after the River Parrett burst its banks in February

After: The landscape around the nearby village, a scene of protests calling for more dredging during the crisis, has now been returned to normality after the heaviest rains in 250 years finally stopped

Before: Farmers were among the worst hit as waters up to eight feet deep in some places submerged their land. The owners of farms around the country donated animal fodder to those badly affected in a much-needed show of support

After: As new pictures show, farmland has now reappeared from the waters, allowing farmers  to at last return their cattle to the land. James Winslade, who lost all 790 acres of his farm to the floods, said this week: 'I didn't expect to see green fields again, but there you are.'
