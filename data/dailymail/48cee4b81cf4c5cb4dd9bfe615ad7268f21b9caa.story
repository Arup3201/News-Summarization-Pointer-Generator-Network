No playing: Idyllic Brandon Hill Park in Bristol could be one of the ares that kids cannot play under plans proposed by the council

Killjoy council officials
have unveiled plans to ban kids from climbing trees and playing 'annoying'
balls games in public parks or they'll be fined £500.

The strict new rules proposed
by Bristol City Council would also ban adults from entering a children's play
area unless they are in charge of a child under 14.

This could effectively ban
mothers and fathers from chatting to friends who do not have children  while they keep an
eye on their own child.

The by-laws would also ban
barbecues outside designated areas and even 'repetitive' music in 207 city
parks.

Critics claim that sun
shelters and windbreaks could also be banned under sweeping rules to prevent
tents being erected.

Some local politicians have
slammed the proposals - which could see law breakers fined £500 for doing any of these activities - as an
'over-reaction' to complaints about anti-social behaviour.

Councillor Dr Mark Wright
said: 'The proposed new bans are a massive over-reaction to issues that are
either better managed by education and common sense, or are a natural result of
demographics with different world-views using public areas together.

'The vast majority of
city-centre residents have no garden and live in purpose-built or converted
flats. For them, public parks are the only open space they have access to.

'The large majority of parks
have no designated barbecue facility and most likely never will.

'The ban on barbecues
everywhere except designated areas is therefore a de-facto total ban on
barbecues in the vast majority of parks, and for the large majority of central
residents with no garden it is a de-facto ban on enjoying barbecues full stop.'

Banned: Children could be stopped from playing ball games outside a designated area

No climbing: council officials have unveiled plans to ban kids from climbing trees

The report put together by
council bosses contains a list of 39 new rules put forward in response to 92
complaints about 'nuisance' behaviour in parks over two years.

It says: 'No person shall
without reasonable excuse climb any wall or fence in or enclosing the ground,
or any tree, or any barrier, railing, post or other structure.

'No person aged 14 years or
over shall enter or remain in a designated area which is a children's play area
unless in charge of a child under the age of 14 years.'

It adds: 'No person shall play ball
games outside a designated area for playing ball games in such a manner as to
cause danger or give reasonable grounds for annoyance to any other person in
the ground.

'No person shall, after being
requested to desist by any other person in the ground, make or permit to be
made any noise which is continuous or repeated.'

The proposals would also ban
skateboarding deemed to 'cause danger or give reasonable grounds for
annoyance'.

Bristol City Council and the
police received more than 3,000 complaints about anti-social behaviour in open
spaces over the last two years.

Park: Any child or adult caught breaking the law in Brandon Hill Park could be fined £500

The fines would be dished out
by police officers, PCSOs and dog wardens and have come about after a public
consultation of almost 1,000 people.

The proposals were expected
to be voted through a full council meeting today until Bristol's elected Mayor
George Ferguson stepped in.

He pulled the vote and has
now sent the plans to be scrutinised by a cross-party group.

A spokesman for the council
said the rules would only be enforced in parks where there has been complaints
to the council or police and only as a last resort.

He added: 'The adoption of
the powers were emphatically not about banning people from enjoying activity
but rather to give the local authority to intervene where there was a clear
problem or nuisance.'

Regarding the ban of adults,
he said: 'The aim is to ensure that play areas are targeted and maintained
for the use of the age group they are designed and intended for.

'If
we had complaints about adults in these spaces without a child over 14
entering and using the equipment we will always raise awareness of the
requirements and ask people to leave.'
