A university athletics instructor has been charged after arranging to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, authorities said on Sunday.

Brian Jansen, 44, was caught in a police sting after setting up the sexual encounter with a minor during online chats. The 'teen girl' was actually an undercover female police officer.

Jansen, who teaches at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, was arrested on Thursday when he turned up at the agreed time to a home in his Dodge minivan.

He was charged with using a computer to seduce a child among other charges but posted $30,000 bail on Friday.

The married college employee had told the girl he was 38 and discussed his favorite sexual positions with her, asking if she wanted to be with an older man, according to the Daytona Beach News Journal.

As police swooped, he cried out: 'I knew it, I knew it. My life is over. I made a stupid decision.'

Jansen told officers that if a girl had actually answered the door, he would have been unable to go through with the sex.

The 44-year-old has been suspended without pay from his job at the college who refused to comment on the allegations at this time.
