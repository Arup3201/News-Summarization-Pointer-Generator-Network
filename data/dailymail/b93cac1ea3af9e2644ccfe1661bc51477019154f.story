'Flush it now' was the warning issued by a Jetstar cabin crew member to a plane full of Splendour in the Grass passengers.

The casual employee gave the music festival revellers the heads-up that sniffer dogs were waiting at Sydney airport late Sunday night and suggested they flush their drugs before arrival.

'We have been told there are sniffer dogs and quarantine officers waiting in the domestic terminal, the male crew member said, reported News.com.au.

'If you need to dispose of anything you shouldn't have we suggest you flush it now.'

Many of the passengers on flight from the Gold Coast had been at Splendour in the Grass in Byron Bay.

There are reports passengers dashed for the plane's toilets and were seen queuing as they clenched things in their hands.

Yet the crew member's announcement left some passengers angered and questioning the reasoning behind warning people who may have been breaking the law and otherwise could have been caught.

The airline confirmed the employee made his own improvised quarantine announcement rather than the using prerecorded one used by Jetstar.

A spokesman said the airline is required to play the prerecorded announcement to passengers on all interstate and territory boarders and that its procedures allow cabin crew to deliver the quarantine message through public announcement as was done on this occasion.

'The crew member's words were poorly chosen and are plainly at odds with the professional standards we'd expect from our team. We're addressing the matter with the cabin crew member involved.'

Jetstar has been contacted for comment.
