Pickup truck driver Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez will not be charged until an investigation into Tuesday's crash has been completed

A decision on whether charges should be brought against a truck driver involved in a crash that derailed a California commuter train will not be made until the investigation is complete, Ventura County's top prosecutor said on Thursday.

District Attorney Gregory D. Totten cited the complexity of the investigation and number of agencies involved in announcing that no charges would immediately be filed against Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona.

Totten said, however, that the Oxnard Police Department acted properly in arresting Ramirez for investigation of leaving the scene of an injury accident under state hit-and-run law.

In a text message, Ramirez's attorney, Ron Bamieh, said his client will be released from jail but provided no details pending an afternoon news conference.

A commuter train's on-board camera captured a fiery crash with a pickup truck abandoned by its driver on Tuesday morning, and federal investigators say the video could give a big boost to the search for a cause.

The video, taken from the outward-facing camera on the front car of the Metrolink train bound for Los Angeles, was sent back to the Washington home of the National Transportation Safety Board for analysis, board member Robert Sumwalt said.

Sumwalt also said that while the truck wasn't stuck in the way that vehicles sometimes get trapped between railroad crossing safety arms, investigators have not ruled out that the truck was somehow stranded and will determine why it traveled 80 feet down the tracks and remained there with its parking brake engaged.

'I don't think anybody would put a car or truck on ... railroad tracks and not try to get it off if there's an approaching train,' Sumwalt said.

The crash in Oxnard, about 45 miles (70 km) northwest of Los Angeles, flipped over three double-decker Metrolink rail cars and derailed two others. It tore apart the Ford pickup truck Sanchez-Ramirez drove onto the tracks after making a wrong turn before dawn.

Thirty people were injured, four critically, in the Tuesday pre-dawn crash.

Ramirez's attorney has said his client accidentally turned onto the tracks and made repeated attempts to get the vehicle off the rails, and then ran for his life as the train approached.

Police said Ramirez was found 45 minutes after the crash 1.6 miles away, though Bamieh said he was only a half-mile away and that he has phone records that show he spoke with police much sooner.

Police said Ramirez did not call 911 and made no immediate effort to call for help. But Bamieh said Ramirez, who doesn't speak English well, tried to get help from a passerby, attempted to call his employer, and eventually reached his son to help him speak with police.

Police arrested Ramirez on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, but Bamieh said he went for help in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles 

'The reality is he basically freaked out trying to help people,' Bamieh said. 'Did he do everything like James Bond? No, he did the best he could.'

He said Ramirez made repeated attempts to get the vehicle off the rails and then ran for his life as the train approached.

Sanchez-Ramirez accidentally drove onto the tracks and made the situation worse by continuing forward in an attempt to get enough speed to get his wide pickup over the rails, Bamieh said. When that effort failed, he tried to push the truck and then fled before the impact.

'He hits his high beams trying to do something. He's screaming. He realizes, 'I can't do anything,' and then he tries to run so he doesn't get killed,' Bamieh said. 'He saw the impact, yes. It was a huge explosion.'

National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said on Wednesday that investigators have not ruled out that the truck was somehow stranded and will determine why it traveled 80 feet down the tracks and remained there with its parking brake engaged.

Ramirez had a drunken driving conviction in Arizona in 1998 and a pair of traffic citations. Bamieh said the citations were minor and the DUI was too old to be relevant to the current circumstances.

Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said 

The track also used by freight and Amtrak trains was restored to service around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, and commuter trains would begin rolling again in the evening, Metrolink said. 

Passenger Joel Bingham said many of those aboard the train on Tuesday were asleep and shocked awake when the loud boom first happened.

'It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,' Bingham said. 'A brush of death definitely came over me.'

Eight people were admitted to the hospital of the 30 people originally examined, officials said.

The four passenger cars remained largely intact, as did the locomotive.

The NTSB planned to examine the effectiveness of those cars, Sumwalt said.

The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m.

The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes, but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said.

The crossing has been the scene of many crashes over the years.

After one killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily in passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact.

Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked. 'Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,' he said.

Tuesday's crash happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster, which left 25 people dead on Sept. 12, 2008. 

A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth.
