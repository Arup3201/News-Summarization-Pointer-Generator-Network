These dramatic images show a horror crash which left two innocent people fighting for life after two young drivers raced each other side-by-side at speeds of up to 80mph.

Police civilian worker Furqaan Mohmed, 21, and 30-year old Mohammed Usman Patel challenged each other to a two mile road duel whilst driving their Vauxhall Astras through a town centre.

However, disaster struck as a BMW car unwittingly veered into their path as the pair roared alongside each other on the wrong side of the road towards a red light.

Dramatic: CCTV footage shows the moment young drivers Furqaan Mohmed and Mohammed Patel raced each other through the streets of Bolton, Greater Manchester at speeds of up to 80mph before a crash which left two pedestrians fighting for their lives

Race: Police civilian worker Mohmed, 21, and 30-year-old Patel had challenged each other to a two mile road duel whilst driving their Vauxhall Astras through the town centre

Caught: The race between the two drivers was captured on CCTV cameras as the pair roared alongside each other on the wrong side of the road towards a red light

Their cars ploughed into the BMW, causing Patel’s Astra to spin out of control and collide with a parked Audi A3 as it mounted a kerb.

Before the Astra could come to a stop, it struck 12-year-old schoolboy Raheem Hussain as he walking home after an evening of prayers at the mosque.

The car then smashed into a bus shelter, hitting a 51-year-old pedestrian and flinging him under another vehicle parked nearby.

A court heard that as witnesses tended to the injured, the drivers were overheard laughing, with one saying to the other: 'We will never race again.'

It emerged the incident occurred whilst Patel was banned from driving.

Raheem suffered a bleed and swelling 
to his brain and multiple breaks to his leg, causing doctors to fear at 
one stage that they would have to amputate it.

He
was kept in a medically induced coma for three weeks and underwent an 
operation to save his leg and a blood transfusion. His family home has 
had to be adapted to suit him as he may have to use a wheelchair for six
months.

Marget trader
Saleem Mogradia was in hospital for two weeks with a fractured arm 
which needed metal plates, broken ribs and a punctured lung. 

Aftermath: A 12-year-old boy and a 51-year-old market trader were left with serious injuries when the racing drivers hit a BMW which caused Patel's Astra to spin out of control and mount the the pavement before hitting them both

Victim: Schoolboy Raheem Hussain suffered a bleed and swelling to his brain and multiple breaks to his leg, causing doctors to fear that they would have to amputate it

He later revealed he had to quit his job after the injury and said: 'This incident has had a huge impact. All my independence and dignity has gone.'

Two other people suffered minor injuries in the huge impact.

Today at Bolton Crown Court, Patel and Mohmed, both of Bolton, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Patel also admitted perverting the course of justice, driving whilst disqualified and driving without insurance.

Patel was jailed for three years and 10 months, while Mohmed was sentenced to two years and eight months.

Both were banned from driving for four years.

Jailed: Both Mohammed Patel, left, and Furqaan Mohmed, right, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Patel also admitted perverting the course of justice, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance. Both were given prison sentences and banned from driving

Mohmed who worked as a Greater Manchester Police Operational Support Officer at Farnworth police station has since been dismissed from his job.

A third man Mohammed Vohra, 20, also of Bolton, who falsely claimed to be driving Patel’s car, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to six months, suspended for 18 months.

He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.

The crash took place at around 11.30pm on Sunday, July 21, after Patel and Mohmed, spotted each other at the wheel of their cars by chance and began racing for a lark.

Lindsay Thomas, prosecuting, said: 'The two vehicles were first seen travelling at about 70mph even though it has a 50mph limit. One driver said two vehicles overtook him and carried on straight through the red light.

Carnage: Damage caused to one of the two Astra's in the crash on July 21

Unwitting: Disaster struck when the Astras driven by Patel and Mohmed hit a BMW 320, causing Patel's car to spin out of control

'A bus driver caught the cars speeding along side by side on its CCTV. The driver estimates they were going at around 80mph in a built-up area and another driver heard the screeching of tyres. The cars were side by side.'

The court was told that one female driver, who saw both vehicles veering towards her on the wrong side of the road, said to herself 'I’m dead', before slamming her car into reverse and mounting the pavement to get out of the way.

Mrs Thomas said: 'Another witness saw two cars side by side undertake her vehicle along a bus lane. They appeared to be going very fast and were clearly racing.'

As the cars reached a junction they overtook another moving vehicle and hit the BMW, which was emerging from a side street.

Vohra was initially treated by police as the driver of Patel’s Astra after he tried to cover for Patel, who was disqualified from driving.

This meant Patel was not tested for alcohol or drugs at the scene.

The court heard he had previous convictions for driving without insurance, using a mobile phone at the wheel of his car and driving across a pedestrian crossing and had been banned under the totting up procedure.

Mohammed Nawaz, mitigating for Patel, said: 'There wasn’t any element of the two of them meeting through a pre-arranged meeting to race.

'This was a chance meeting. Then through utter foolishness and stupidity they egged each other on.

'Perhaps only through luck and good fortune no one has died. He is ashamed of his actions and wrote a letter of apology to the victims.

'He is exceptionally contrite about the suffering he has caused.

Smash: Patel's Astra mounted a curb, striking 12-year-old Raheem and flinging Saleem Mogradia under a nearby parked car

Danger: Judge Timothy Clayson told the pair they had driven as if they were 'invincible', and had deliberately ignored the rules of the road

'He wants to say that no one was laughing at the scene of the collision, he said that did not occur.'

In a statement read to the court Mohmed said: 'I never set out to cause so much trouble.

'I think about it every day and every night. I know what people think of me when I am walking in my area. I hope they don’t think of my family in the same way.'

Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'You decided to race each other in your cars through the built-up streets of Bolton. The truly horrifying CCTV shows how dangerous your driving was and you caused the crash.'

He added: 'You drove as if you were invincible. You caused injury to a young boy who suffered a serious brain injury and fractures which almost required amputation and time in a medically induced coma. They are possibly life-changing consequences.

'No words better describe the way you were driving than driving with a deliberate decision to ignore the rules of the road and the great danger caused to others. You do now understand the distress and unhappiness you have caused to so many people.'

Speaking after the hearing Sergeant Danny Byrne said: 'To say that it is fortunate nobody was killed as a result of this collision and more importantly Mohmed and Patel’s appalling driving is a complete understatement.

'The manner of their reprehensible driving was a tragedy waiting to happen: they were using the roads as a racing track, showing nothing but contempt for other road users and members of the public.'
