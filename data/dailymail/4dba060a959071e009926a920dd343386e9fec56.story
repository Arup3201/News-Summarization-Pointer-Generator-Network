Tragic: Triona Priestley, 15, from Dublin, lost her battle with cystic fibrosis minutes after singer Ed Sheeran sang her a song she loved - Little Bird

A dying Irish girl’s last dream came true when her favourite pop star sang to her over the phone shortly before she passed away.

Triona Priestley, 15, from Dublin, lost her battle with cystic fibrosis minutes after singer Ed Sheeran sang her a song she loved - Little Bird.

One of her friends, Lucy Hanlon, revealed Triona’s heart-breaking last minutes.

She wrote on Facebook: ‘It is with great sadness that I have to share with you all today – our beautiful angel was taken from us.

‘As we all know about the Twitter campaign, Ed’s manager Stuart Camp emailed me and today Ed rang Triona and personally sang Little Bird to her as she took her last breaths.

‘Triona left us listening to her idol surrounded by all the  people who loved her.

‘People’s respect is incredible. We would like to thank everyone. Goodnight, my angel. Sleep tight.’

There had been a widespread Twitter campaign with the hashtag #SongForTri after her friends wrote online about Triona’s last wish.

It is understood that Sheeran rang the teenager and sang her favourite song to her.

The singer later commented on Triona’s passing on his Twitter page, saying: ‘Rest in peace Triona, so heartbreaking x’

Previously he had written: ‘Get well soon dude and I’ll see you when I’m over in October xx.’

The young girl’s mother Bernie said: ‘She is so proud her friends did this for her, she gave us a big smile when she found out.’

She also said: ‘From birth, Triona has been in and out of hospital but it didn’t affect [her brother] Colm in the same way.

‘CF is a progressive illness and it has impacted a lot on Triona’s life. 

‘Before she even starts her day she has to have medication, use nebulisers, get physio while most children are able to just get up and have their breakfast.

‘In the last two years, Triona’s condition has worsened and she doesn’t get to school as often as she would like to.

‘She has missed a lot of classes and she has a lot of admissions to hospital and that’s why I got involved in trying to support any kind of initiative Temple Street's Children's University Hospital have in upgrading any kind of physical environment that the kids have to be put in.’

#SongForTri trended on Twitter since this weekend as thousands of Triona’s friends and family joined forces to try and contact the singer and make her dream happen.

Well known CF campaigner Orla Tinsley wrote of Triona: ‘The blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl had seen me on The Late Late Show talking about Cystic Fibrosis.

‘The next day she walked into her classroom and told her teacher she wanted to talk to the class. Her friends knew that she was sick, in and out of hospital a lot, but they didn’t know why.

‘She wrote to tell me that seeing an older woman with CF had made her confident. 

‘That she felt like she should be proud and decided it was time to explain why she was sick all the time. It was one of the most moving emails I have ever read.

‘She told me I was her hero and that she wanted to be a writer some day too. 

‘She was having trouble keeping up in school and hospital was driving her crazy – but she was dealing with it all by writing poetry after her consultant had told her to give it a try.

‘It was gut wrenching, heart-felt and deeply affecting poetry – wise beyond her years.’
