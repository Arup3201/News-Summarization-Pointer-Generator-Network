Alan Pardew has confirmed that goalkeeper Rob Elliot will miss the next ‘six to eight games’ and has challenged rookie Jak Alnwick to win a new contract in that time.

Newcastle - who are without first choice Tim Krul until the end of January - cannot bring in a replacement stopper on an emergency loan deal and will instead hand 21-year-old Alnwick his full Premier League debut at Arsenal on Saturday.

And Pardew, who lost Elliot to a torn thigh muscle during last weekend’s 2-1 victory over Chelsea, explained: ‘Robbie will be out for six to eight games, so it's a great opportunity for Jak and he's very keen to take it.

Alnwick cut an impressive presence as he thwarted the Premier League regularly at St James' Park

‘He's had a great start and has fitted in very well. He has worked very hard in the background but never had an opportunity.

‘I have great faith in him but he will need a lot of luck as well, particularly in that crucial position.

‘He deserves a bit of luck because he is a cracking lad and I’m very proud of him.

‘His contract is up at end of season and this puts him in a great position if he plays really well in the next seven game, and makes it more difficult for us when it comes to contract negotiations. That is definitely in Jak's court.’
