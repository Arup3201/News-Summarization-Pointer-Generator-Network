Those of you who walk or cycle home each night will have noticed a change in the air in the past couple of weeks. All of a sudden it is spring. After a winter battling through the wind, it is a joy to cycle home late on a balmy evening, long after the rush-hour commuters have left the roads. 

And so, a little over a week ago, having finished giving an evening lecture at Birkbeck College in central London, I was looking forward to the five-mile cycle home to North London. It had been a long day and a glass of wine beckoned. 

But as I approached the cycle racks of the university campus, I realised, with a sinking heart, that my bike was gone. A feeling of impotent rage overwhelmed me.

Back in the saddle: Gavin Evans with his stolen bike, which he tracked down and recovered via Gumtree

Six months earlier, my previous bike had been stolen, but that one was nearing its end and I’d used a flimsy lock. It was an annoyance, but no great loss. In fact, I’d had four bikes stolen in London — not to mention several wheels and bike light fittings. 

This one, though, was different. Yes, it was a bog-standard bike, but it had been newly serviced and was purring with a fresh set of gears. I’d used a strong lock in an area full of security guards. On a resentful train journey home, I cursed all bike thieves.

That evening, I composed a sad moan and posted it on Facebook. I was immediately inundated with similar tales of woe. 

Anyone I knew who cycled had had a bike — often several — stolen. 

My friend Gabi consoled me with her own account of having her spanking new bike stolen when it was locked inside a bike shed at a Hampstead gym.

When she called the police, they told her to look on the second-hand websites Gumtree and eBay. It only took a few minutes of searching for bikes for sale in her area to turn up her own. 

She told the police who advised her to set up a meeting with the thief on the pretext of wanting to buy it. The police would meet her there and make an arrest. But by the time she called the seller, he’d already sold it — for £400. 

Without much optimism, I began to search for bikes for sale on Gumtree in London. And, voila! The most recent bike to have been posted to the site looked just like mine. It was on sale for £90. The bike had originally cost me £200. 

I emailed my number to the seller and we arranged to meet on the street corner of Royal Mint Street near Tower Bridge at 9.30pm. Bike thieves, it didn’t surprise me to learn, prefer to operate from street corners, late at night. 

The seller, calling himself ‘Morad’, was a 20-something with a couple of scars on his face. He seemed friendly enough and let me take it for a spin. 

It certainly felt exactly like mine — same brakes, grips, bell, tyres, same quirks — but the street lights were too dim for me to see the markings and the bike was missing my rack, pedal clips and light fittings. 

I rode it for a while, but eventually decided I was only 75 per cent sure it was my bike. I didn’t want to accuse a potentially innocent young man of theft. 

Reluctantly, I told Morad I would think about it. 

I was writhing with frustration by the time I arrived home. I was convinced I’d been too forgiving. So I sent the Gumtree link to Dave, the man who originally sold me the bike.

He noted that the gear shifts were different to the ones on the bike I’d bought. ‘That’s unusual. Did you have one of them changed?’

I had indeed, and the replaced gear matched the one in the picture. ‘Then it’s yours,’ he said. ‘Everything else is identical. And don’t be put off by the rack. They always sell those separately. Go get your property!’

This time, a different me was required. So that Morad wouldn’t suspect me, I needed a new name, phone number and voice. Caitlin, my younger daughter, declared that my various American accents were ‘pathetic’. The best I could come up with was a gruff Texan. 

I was also worried Morad would recognise me, so I disguised myself with my running club’s bobble hat and wrap-around sunglasses. 

That night, I told my students where I was going. ‘What if he stabs you?’ asked one as I was leaving. 

I remembered a scene in the U.S. cop series The Wire, where one of the characters uses a magazine inside his shirt to protect his stomach from knife wounds. So I added a magazine and a small paperback to each inside pocket of my leather jacket, just to be safe. 

Glancing in the mirror, I couldn’t help but think I looked a bit of a prat. Hardly Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. 

This time, a more cautious Morad arrived. He told me that the bike was locked a short walk away and took me through a rough-looking housing estate. 

‘Haven’t I seen you before?’ he asked suspiciously.  

‘Not that I recall,’ I answered in my Texan accent. ‘I just want to buy a bike for my son.’ 

Morad’s greed for the £90 was enough to set aside his doubts. He unlocked the bike — my bike — and my anger bubbled up. 

‘You’re a thieving piece of scum!’ I said, returning to my normal accent and removing my hat and sunglasses. ‘This bike is stolen, and it’s mine!’

He must have been taken aback by this odd, little, middle-aged man ranting at him, but after a few seconds of nose-to-nose silence, he rallied. 

‘Prove it!’ he demanded.

I went through the identifying markers, Dave had pointed out to me. But Morad was having none of it. ‘Did you see me steal it? Hey? Hey?’ he yelled. 

‘If I had seen you trying to steal it, it wouldn’t have been stolen. Anyway, you’re selling a stolen bike, which is a crime. We can go together to the police.’

‘Or? Or?’ he asked.

‘Or I’ll take it with me right now.’

‘Take it,’ he said, rather to my astonishment. He was clearly desperate to get away without the police getting involved. 

‘But what about my rack? It was a new rack.’

‘The other guys took it,’ he said, abandoning any pretence that the bike hadn’t been stolen. ‘I just sell the bikes.’

Once home, I contacted the administrative team at Gumtree to report Morad, who, by then, had removed the ad. They took a note of his details so that he couldn’t sell any further stolen property on the site. 

With my bike safely locked in the flat, I did some research. 

According to the Metropolitan Police, an astonishing 14,079 bicycle thefts were reported in London between June and December last year. This, of course, is only a small proportion of the true total because most victims don’t bother to report their loss. 

But by head of population, the bike-theft capital of Britain may well be Cambridge where my elder daughter, Tessa, had two well-locked bicycles stolen in one year. In the two months up to March 14 this year, 2,335 Cambridge bikes were reported as stolen. That’s nearly 40 each day. 

A contemporary of my daughter’s at Cambridge had an experience not unlike mine. 

After having her bike stolen from outside the theology faculty, she looked at Gumtree in the hope of finding a cheap replacement. There, brazenly offered for sale, was her own bike. She contacted the seller and asked to meet him.

She then enlisted two friends — both rangy oarsmen from the college rowing crew — to go with her to meet the seller. At first, he’d tried to get her to meet him on a housing estate outside the city, but she insisted on a main road near to her own college. 

The moment the thief saw the two boys he was cagey and suspicious. He wanted to know why she had brought friends. 

When she confronted him about the bike and told him it was hers, he turned aggressive, shouting at her and calling her a liar. Then, before the others had time to react, he jumped on the bike and made a dash for it. 

The students reported the incident to the police, but the bike was never returned. The thief had used various false email addresses when he’d set up his Gumtree account and couldn’t be traced. 

With the knowledge that most thieves get away with it, I reported Morad to the police, who, rather to my surprise, came to my flat. 

As he was leaving, one of the constables offered some advice: ‘Next time, use two locks. And if it still gets stolen and you find it on Gumtree, phone us first. It’s safer that way. You were lucky.’

My advice would go further. Mark your bike in some way that only you know. If it is stolen, look on Gumtree and eBay. Contact the seller swiftly and arrange to meet. Let the police know what you plan to do. 

But what I’d really like to say is that if you know the bike is yours, you should ask to give it a test ride, then make your getaway, cycling furiously for home, leaving the thief in the dust. 

The bobble hat, sunglasses and fake American accent are, of course, optional.
