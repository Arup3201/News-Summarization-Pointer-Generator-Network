Interns usually spend their time making tea and running errands - but not the interns at Nasa.

With the excitement of Orion's 'picture perfect' test flight out of the way, the space agency's work experience team seem to have found themselves at a loose end.

So, what better way to fill the time than to create parody of Meghan Trainor's number one single, All About That Bass?

With the excitement of Orion's 'picture perfect' test flight out of the way, the space agency's work experience team decided to create parody of Meghan Trainor's number one single, All About That Bass?

The resulting video is a mix of pop-style dance moves, cringeworthy lyrics and shots of the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, which helped launch the Orion spacecraft a week ago.

'Hey, they're working so hard, don't you love these Nasa guys?/They will take us so far the first time that Orion flies/You know we travelling' to deep destinations 'fore too long,' they lyrics say.

Orion captured the world's attention when it orbited the Earth twice, in an effort to test systems that could one day take humans to Mars.

But excitement around the Nasa launch has since faded. To rekindle interest, the Johnson Space Centre tasked its interns with creating a viral video dubbed All About that Space.

Last week, for the first time in nearly half a century, Nasa launched a spaceship designed to carry astronauts far beyond Earth.

Riding atop a fountain of fire, the 24-story-tall Orion spacecraft soared above the Atlantic Ocean on the 5th of December, punching through partly cloudy skies.

The unmanned craft was then catapulted around the Earth twice in a 4.5-hour journey, before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,000 km/h).

In the future, Nasa hopes to use the spacecraft to send astronauts to an asteroid in the 2020s and ultimately take them to Mars in the 2030s.

The lyrics, written by Sarah Schlieder, talk about how the space agency is attempting to complete project like the Apollo mission that took humans to the Moon in 1969.

'I'm bringing rockets back/ Go ahead and tell the whole world that/ We're doing exploration. Come on, board it stat/ We're ready for liftoff,' the interns sing.

Trainor's single, All About that Bass was one of the fastest selling singles of the year, and held the number one spot longer than any other song in 2014.

This isn't the first time Nasa-fans have turned to music to convey their enthusiasm for space.

In 2012, a parody clip on LMFAO's party anthem Sexy and I Know It, space enthusiasts talked about celebrated the Nasa Curiosity mission.

With lyrics like 'We're better than SpaceX and we ain't afraid to show it,' the video became an instant hit.

The Curiosity Rover even tweeted: 'This fan-made video is awesome (and I know it),' adding the mission hashtag #MSL and #wigglewigglewiggle.
