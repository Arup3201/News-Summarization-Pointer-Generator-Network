Accused: Princess Cristina and her husband Inaki Urdangarin. She has been named as a suspect in a corruption case involving him

The King of Spain's youngest daughter has been named as a suspect in a 5 million Euro corruption scandal.

Princess Cristina, 47 - one of King Juan Carlos's three children - will be called in for questioning later this month, a court in Palma de Mallorca has announced.

She will be quizzed over claims her husband Inaki Urdangarin, 45, and his former business partner Diego Torres, 47, embezzled cash from public funds.

The duo are accused of siphoning off the money, from their supposedly non-profit Nóos Institute - of which Princess Cristina was a board member - to their own coffers.

Prosecutors claim the pair used Urdangarin’s powerful connections to win public contracts, and then over-charged councils for the sports events they organised.

Urdangarin was chairman of the charitable body between 2004 and 2006.

An official investigation was launched into the alleged fraud, which both men deny and have yet to be charged, last year.

There had never been any suggestion that mother-of-four Cristina, who is seventh in line to the throne, was involved.

But yesterday a shadow was cast over the Royal family after emails between the Princess and former Olympic handball star Urdangarin, whom she married in 1997, were leaked to Judge Jose Castro by Torres.

Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Urdangarin sent her one email, dated February 20, 2003, which asked her to look over a message to 'contributors, clients and friends' that he intended to send out on behalf of the Institute.

The following day, he allegedly sent out the same email to a wider range of recipients - including Queen Sofia and King Juan Carlos - where he also asked for advice on what he was writing.

While the emails alone do not prove the Princess was involved, Castro is believed to want to grill her in more detail on the issue.

Allegations: The investigation into Mr Urdangarin's business dealings has caused embarrassment for the Spanish Royal Family. He is pictured here with Princess Cristina and King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia

The judge recently set joint bail of 8.2
million euros for Mr Urdangarin and Mr Torres and said the two 'ignored
the rules of public contracting as long as they achieved their aim, 
which was no other than to divert public funds for their own benefit or 
that of others.'

He said the two agreed to make as 
much as possible out of Mr Urdangarin's relationship with the Royal 
Palace in their dealings with public and private entities.

Mr
Urdangarin, 45, comes from a wealthy Basque family but is not nobility; he became Duke 
of Palma because Cristina is Duchess of Palma. The couple have four 
children. Princess Cristina is the youngest of the king's two daughters 
and the middle of his three children.

The royal family decided last year to sideline Mr Urdangarin from all official royal activities, and recently removed him from the family website.

Cristina is the youngest of the 
King’s two daughters, behind Princess Elena, 49 . The King and wife 
Sofia also have a son, Prince Felipe, 45, who is heir to the throne.

The royal household has refused to 
comment on the news, which comes as polls suggest support for the 
monarchy has fallen to a record low of 54 per cent.

It also follows the revelation that 
Juan Carlos, 75, received a 2.2million Euro inheritance, deposited in 
three Swiss bank accounts, when his father Juan died on April 1, 1993.

Questions are now being asked as to 
whether the King, under fire for going elephant-hunting in Africa last 
year as recession continues to bite, paid the correct amount of tax on 
the sum.

The trip to Botswana only came to light after he fell and broke his hip, but sparked anger among Spain’s 5 million unemployed.

It also cost him his role as honorary
president of the Spanish branch of the World Wildlife Fund and saw him 
issue an unprecedented apology.

It is in stark contrast to a decade ago when Juan Carlos was left virtually untouched by the media.

He was held in great respect for his 
role in brokering the transition from dictatorship to democracy 
following the death of General Franco in 1975.
