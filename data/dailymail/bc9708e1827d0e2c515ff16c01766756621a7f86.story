From Australian models to Jesinta Campbell, Rachel Finch to television presenters such as Kris Smith, hundreds of thousands of people use photo-sharing app Instagram to share moments and memories.

But from Wednesday Australian Instagram users will start seeing advertising infiltrate their photo streams.

The images and videos will appear as regular posts do, but will be prominently marked as 'sponsored' content.

Australian users of the app will see ads in their photo streams from Wednesday

Australian celebrities - such as Jesinta Campbell - are big fans of the photo-sharing app Instagram

Celebrities and amateur photographers alike are big fans of the app, which allows people to like, comment and tag people in a range of posts.

Users Down Under is the third country to get Instagram ads, following the UK last month and the US a year ago.

Ten brands, some of them iconically Australian such as Tourism Queensland and Vegemite, have jumped on board for the launch. 

Lindy Klim is also a big user of the app - which allows followers and friends to comment on and like posts

Ben & Jerry's, Toyota, Flight Centre, Audi, Lenovo, McDonalds and Philadelphia Cream Cheese are also included in the first round of advertisers.

Instagram says the rollout will start slowly. Ads will be targeted at users based on demographic factors such as their age and gender.

The advertisements will display like normal posts, but will be clearly labelled as sponsored content

This is similar to the way ads are presented on Facebook, which owns the free photo-sharing platform.

'Our aim is to help brands create beautiful ads that feel as natural to Instagram as the photos and videos people already share,' marketing chief Amy Cole said.

The company is so keen to ensure the ads fit seamlessly into photo feeds that each is being vetted by co-founder Kevin Systrom.

Vegemite and car brand Audi are among the first ten brands to have signed on for the lauch

If users see an ad they don't like or would rather not see, they'll be able to hide it from their feed and give feedback.

Instagram, launched in October 2010, has 200 million active users globally. It doesn't disclose Australian user numbers.
