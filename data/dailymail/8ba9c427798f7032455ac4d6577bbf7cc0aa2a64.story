The Queen has been given a collection of 97 original works of art by members of the Royal Academy including David Hockney and Tracey Emin as a Diamond Jubilee gift.

Fortunately there are no unmade beds included, but with Hockney’s Beverly Hills Housewife selling at auction for more than £5.2 million three years ago, the present is likely to be worth a small fortune.

Fortunately the monarch, who celebrated 60 years on the throne in June, has given the collection of Jubilee-inspired prints, drawings, photographs and works in oil, watercolour and mixed media, to the Royal Collection on behalf of the nation, who will display them at the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham palace next autumn.

The Queen is Patron of the Royal Academy, which was founded by George III in 1768 as a professional body for artists and a venue for exhibitions that would be open to the public.

Remarkably, Yorkshire-born Hockney chose to create his Jubilee-themed masterpiece on his iPad, while Emin chose to offer a surprisingly restrained monoprint portrait - a form of printmaking that has images or lines that can only be made once - of the Queen herself.

Anish Kapoor has offered something called Untitled but looks rather like what can only be described as a blazing red ball.

Transvestite potter Grayson Perry has, also rather oddly, contributed a sketch of a Kenilworth AM1 motorbike, while Richard Wilson's 'Hang on a minute lads, I've got a great idea!’ is a collage featuring a bus which has crashed on top of a building.

Fortunately Sculptor John Maine’s Westminster Abbey, a drawing of the Abbey’s Cosmati Pavement, the spot where The Queen was crowned, is a little more traditional.

The architect Michael Manser has also contributed a drawing and photograph of The Queen’s Suite at Heathrow Airport, which he designed in 1988.

The Royal Academy’s chief executive, Charles Saumarez Smith, said: 'We are delighted to be giving this portfolio of works to the Queen for Her Diamond Jubilee. We are proud of our royal heritage and feel privileged to be able to mark this historic occasion.’

Jane Roberts, Librarian and Curator of the Print Room, Royal Collection Trust, responded: ‘The generous gift from the Royal Academicians to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee is yet another highlight in this wonderful celebratory year. It is hugely exciting to be adding this magnificent body of contemporary graphic art to the Royal Collection.'

The Royal Collection is among the largest and most important art collections in the world, and one of the last great European royal collections to remain intact.

The Royal Collection is held in trust by the Sovereign for her successors and the nation, and is not owned by The Queen as a private individual.
