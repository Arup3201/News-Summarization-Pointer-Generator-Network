Jack Wilshere is enjoying his new deep midfield role for England, and wants to improve by watching videos of Andrea Pirlo and Javier Mascherano.

The Arsenal midfielder occupied the position at the base of Roy Hodgson's midfield diamond for the first time on Monday night, and believes he can only get better in his new position.

Wilshere usually plays further forward, but in England's first competitive game since the World Cup he was happy to fill the position vacated by former captain Steven Gerrard.

'I spoke with the manager and  Gary Neville in the week and they told me they wanted me to play that role and I quite enjoyed it,' Wilshere told the FA's website.

'It was my first time ever playing there, so over the next month or so I am going to look at a few videos of the game and of players who play in that position regularly - Pirlo, Mascherano and players like that and I'll get better.

While Wilshere was playing in an unfamiliar role, his new club team-mate Danny Welbeck was given a chance back in his preferred position as a central striker, and the switch produced both of England's goals.

'He really enjoys playing up front,' said Wilshere. 'He hasn't had that opportunity over the past few years and you could tell that tonight he really wanted to prove a point.

'When he gets in front of goal he's as good as they get.' 

'It was a great result. I said in the week we expected to come here and get a result,' Wilshere added.

'We didn't surprise ourselves. I know a few people have been saying a few things but we're confident in ourselves and we showed that tonight.

Pace: With Sterling and Welbeck up front England are playing to their strengths on the break

'We knew the longer the second-half went on at 0-0, they weren't going to be happy, the fans weren't going to be happy and we used that.

'We won the ball back in a dangerous position and we used our pace. We got the goal and we knew again they were going to come out. We had to stay together, defend well and we did that and got another goal so we are happy.'
