Customers in the UK only need to wait until February to get their hands on the curved G Flex phone from LG.

The Korean firm has partnered with mobile network EE to make the 6-inch bendy handset available sometime in February - although the exact date and price have not yet been announced.

However, U.S. customers may have to wait a little longer with LG only stating the phone will arrive in the States 'by the end of Q1'.

Weight: 177g

The U.S. version will be available on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile networks.

The announcements were made during LG's press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.

LG's G Flex phone is already on sale in Korea and costs 1.08 million won (£628).

If prices follow suit in other countries it would put the handset on par with a 32GB iPhone 5S.

LG officially unveiled the G Flex phone in October, after months of rumours and speculation.

The device is vertically curved so it moulds more comfortably to a user's 
face and gives improved voice and sound quality by reducing the distance between a user's mouth and 
the microphone.

It also claims the vertically curved shape increases the sound level by three decibels, compared to flat smartphones.

LG
 released a 55-inch curved TV screen last year, designed to 
improve the viewing angle of the screen, and the Korean firm claims its 
new phone offers a similar experience when watching videos and playing 
games.

LG additionally announced the device has a so-called 
'self-healing' case made from an elastic coating capable of 'recovering 
from daily wear-and-tear scratches and nicks.'

However, the firm did not explain how the coating 'heals' itself, just adding that the case keeps the G Flex 'looking newer longer.'

Elsewhere, the G Flex has the Rear Key button first seen on the LG G2 handset.

This rear-control button has been 
designed so there is less chance of a user accidentally turning off the 
phone, for example.

The button can also be used to control volume levels
 and other tasks.

LG announced at the start of October it had finished work on the 6-inch flexible OLED display now seen on the G Flex phone.

It is made from plastic substrates, rather than glass, and this gives it flexibility as well as making it unbreakable.

The phone also has a curved battery, developed by LG's research arm LG Chem. 

Other features include a 13MP rear-facing camera with a timer that uses the Rear Key to show a countdown has started.

The QTheater tool gives users quick access to photos, videos and YouTube from the lock screen.
