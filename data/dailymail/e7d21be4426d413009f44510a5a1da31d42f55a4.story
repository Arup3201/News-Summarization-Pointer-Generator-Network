It really was an appy new year for Apple, as the firm revealed today customers spent over half a billion dollars on apps and in app purchases in the first week of January.

It also said New Year's Day 2015 marked the single biggest day ever in App Store sales history.

Overall, the firm said it has paid out over $25 billion to app developers.

As part of its latest figures, Apple has put a number to the jobs it has created or supported at home: 1.03 million.

Applications designed for Apple's smartphones and tablets have helped create more than 627,000 U.S. jobs, while 334,000 jobs have resulted from its spending and growth, and 66,000 people work directly for the company in the U.S. 

'Apple ignited the app revolution with the launch of the App Store in 2008,' the company said. 

'Since then, an entire industry has been built around app design and development.'

The new figures follow a record-breaking 2014, in which billings rose 50 per cent and apps generated over $10 billion in revenue for developers. 

In just six years, the iOS ecosystem has helped create 627,000 jobs in the US alone, Apple said. 

'This year is off to a tremendous start after a record-breaking year for the App Store and our developer community,' said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. 

'We're so proud of the creativity and innovation developers bring to the apps they create for iOS users and that the developer community has now earned over $25 billion.'

Apple also launched apps for (RED), a special initiative on the store with exclusive content where all proceeds went to the Global Fund to fight AIDS.

Apple donated a record $20 million this quarter, and since partnering with (RED) has donated over $100 million. 

One of the hits of 2014 came from Australia's Hipster Whale, creator of the game Crossy Road.

'We could never have dreamed of this level of success, with Crossy Road only being available on the App Store for the last six weeks of the year,' said Matthew Hall, co-founder of Hipster Whale. 

Apple's app revenue could be boosted by the arrival of the Apple Watch this year

'In a couple of months we were able to create a simple, fun game that was featured on the App Store and climbed to the top of the App Store charts around the world—it's amazing.'

Late last year iTunes announced its biggest selling apps of the year, with Facebook and Minecraft both topping best seller charts from the App Store.

Facebook's dedicated chat app was the most downloaded free app for iPhones in 2014, ahead of other social networking apps WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram.

The official Facebook app was also fourth in the list, while dating app Tinder came in tenth place. 

Minecraft, the game that allows players to build their own world from scratch using the game's signature blocks, was the most popular paid-for app for both iPhone and iPad devices for the second year running.

It beat 7 Minute Workout challenge on iPhone, and Football Manager Handheld 2014 on iPad.

The mobile version of classic console title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and puzzle game Cut The Rope 2 also made the top 10 on both iPad and iPhone.

In-app purchases - where users can pay to unlock extra features - are also a large part of the App Store, and both iPhone and iPad lists have a top two of Clash Of Clans and Candy Crush Saga, the popular war and puzzle games.

iTunes has announced its biggest selling apps of the year. Minecraft (screenshot shown) was the most popular paid-for app, while the mobile version of classic console title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and puzzle game Cut The Rope 2 also made the top 10 on both iPad and iPhone.

Clash Of Clans leads the way on iPad, with Candy Crush grossing more on iPhone. 

Both featured on the list last year too. Kim Kardashian's self-titled Hollywood game also made the top 10, reaching eighth place.

Apple's flagship tablet, the iPad, was most commonly used for communicating and streaming video, according to the charts, with the top two free downloads on iPad being video-calling service Skype and Facebook Messenger.

Last year, Facebook Messenger did not feature in any of the top ten lists, showing the rapid rise of the messaging app. 

It was followed by subscription video-streaming service Netflix in third and YouTube in fourth.

And while Microsoft only made the mobile version of Word free to all in November, the app still managed to reach fifth in the free iPad apps list.

Apple also handed out their own editorial awards for their pick of the apps of the year, with Replay Video Editor named iPhone app of the year.

The app was shown off on-stage during Apple's iPad event in October, and has now scooped the top iPhone prize. 

iPhone game of the year was puzzle title Threes!, where players have to add and match numbers in order to get a high score.

Industry magazine deputy editor and app expert Jack Parsons said of the awards: 'We've seen a big year for indie games on iOS, and this is reflected in Apple awarding the iPhone and iPad games of the year to Threes! and British-made Monument Valley. 

In 2013 Snapchat (headquarters shown) was top of the messaging apps, but this year it had to settle for a place behind both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp

'However, while these paid-for games have a lot of critical and commercial success, it's no surprise "freemium" games Candy Crush and Clash Of Clans remain the real winners, grossing more in in-app purchases than anyone else.

'The awards for Pixelmator and Replay are well deserved but unsurprising as Apple featured both of them in its keynote.'

Pixelmator was named Apple's iPad app of the year having made the jump to mobile this year after previously only being available on desktop.

The best iPad game was Monument Valley, from British-based developers ustwo, who also recently picked up an Apple design award for their work on the game.
