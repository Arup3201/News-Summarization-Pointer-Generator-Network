The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall arrived in the US yesterday ahead of a tour that will see them meet Barack Obama and visit Muhammad Ali’s hometown.

The UK's Ambassador has suggested that the four-day visit by Charles and Camilla – who landed near Washington last night - will boost Britain's special relationship with America.

The royal couple are making their third joint official visit to the US and will spend much of their time in the capital Washington, highlighting a range of issues and celebrating historic milestones.

US President Barack Obama will sit down for informal talks with Charles and Camilla in the Oval office tomorrow, and will be joined by his vice president Joe Biden.

The prince last met the president in May 2011, a few days after the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - when Mr Obama confessed the occasion had left America mesmerised.

Sir Peter Westmacott said: ‘I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together.

‘Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.’

Landed: Charles arrives, ahead of the visits he and his wife will make to cultural and educational sites

Strong winds buffeted the royal couple and blew the duchess' hair about as they stepped from their chartered plane and headed done the steps at Andrews air force base near Washington - home to the US President's jet Air Force One.

Sir Peter had hoped to greet the royal couple on the tarmac but his car was delayed by a traffic accident on the way to the air force base and he turned back to be sure he could host a reception for his guests.

Charles and Camilla, who wore a Bruce Oldfield dove grey coat and dress, were welcomed by Ian Wiggins instead, deputy head of the British embassy's political office.

Highlights of the trip include a tour of Mount Vernon - home of America's first president George Washington - and Charles will receive an award for exceptional leadership in conservation from the International Conservation Caucus Foundation.
