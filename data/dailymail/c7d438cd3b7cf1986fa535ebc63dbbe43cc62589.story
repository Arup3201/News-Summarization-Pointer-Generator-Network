Ever since Pippa Middleton stepped out with her trusty Aspinal of London handbag twice in one week, it fast became the season's must-have arm candy.

But if the Marylebone tote's super slick design and band of celebrity fans wasn't enough, it just got better.

Ladies, meet the new 
Tech-Marylebone - the first luxury tote to feature an integral juice 
pack and cable paths so you can charge your phone and tablet on the 
move.

Tech meets fashion: Aspinal of London has unveiled the Tech-Marylebone - the first luxury tote to feature an integral juice pack and cable paths so you can charge your phone and tablet on the go

We’ve all been there: 
you’re out and about with a to-do list longer than your arm and your 
contemptible mobile phone battery dies just when you need it most.

But Aspinal's handbag-turned-phone-charger is hoping to put an end to battery woes and become a woman’s ultimate ally.

The bag contains a built-in 
high-capacity battery that claims to recharge your poor energy-sapped 
phone whilst stylishly concealing any of the wires.

Perfect for Pippa: Miss Middleton has the classic £795 version of the bag but if her phone battery runs out from all that texting, she could sure benefit from the tech version

'The subtle addition of juice pack for phone and tablet charging on the go is an innovative touch and makes this the perfect choice for the busy, 21st century woman,' says the brand of their latest design.

But style and practicality don't come cheap - the Tech-Marylebone will set you back £995.

Other famous fans of the luxury British brand include Millie Mackintosh, who is often spotted with her Marylebone tote, as well as Amanda Holden and Mollie King.

The
 Mighty Purse describes itself as a ‘glamorous solution to this 
seemingly hopeless conundrum’ and promises users that they can charge 
their phone on the go without compromising on style.

Made from real leather 
and available in three different finishes, the purse contains a built-in
 high-capacity battery that claims to recharge your poor energy-sapped 
phone up to 2 times per charge.

The purse, which is compatible
 with all Micro USB smartphones and iPhones, can be charged up ahead of 
your night out via your computer.

The gadget, which is 
being sold at Firebox.com, also has an internal 4-LED indicator so 
you'll always know how much juice the charger has left.

The
 purse has room for all the usual girly essentials such as cards, keys 
and make-up and at £84.99, is a fraction of the price of the Aspinal of London offering.
