Juan Mata's representatives flew in on Wednesday to complete a £37million deal to take the midfielder to Manchester United before the end of the week.

The Chelsea star was at the club's Cobham base but trained away from the first team, and it is believed he could have a medical as early as Thursday.

Jose Mourinho was watching his first team train but Mata was conspicuous by his absence.

Although United are treating the 
deal with extreme caution after their failure to land a string of big 
names last summer, manager David Moyes believes the move is close to 
being concluded.

‘I fully understand that supporters are keen to see us freshen up the squad with new faces, but January is a difficult month in which to bring people in,’ Moyes told United Review in his programme notes for the Capital One Cup semi-final, second leg encoutner with Sunderland.

‘While we are actively scouting players all the time, a lot of the work we are doing now is preparation for the summer.

'If we can do any business now then we will certainly try to do it, but I will not comprimise the standards required for a player that can come into this club and help improve it.’

Mata is determined to leave Chelsea after becoming frustrated with his failure to impress Mourinho this season.

United,
 who are six points off fourth place in the Barclays Premier League, are
 under financial pressure to qualify for the Champions League.

And
 although the transfer fee is a huge increase on the £23.5m Chelsea paid
 Valencia in 2011, Moyes is keen to land a big signing in the transfer 
window.

Mata is determined to push through the
 move and Mourinho is understood to have accepted that he wants to leave
 in search of first-team football.

The
 midfielder has concerns about his inclusion in Spain’s World Cup squad 
this summer if he is not playing regularly for his club side and Moyes 
will give him that opportunity as he starts building a team for the 
future.

United are treading
 carefully only because Moyes and his chief executive Ed Woodward failed
 to sign the likes of Thiago Alcantara and Cesc Fabregas during the 
summer.

But this time they have been given all the encouragement they need that Mata wants to leave Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea’s
 Player of the Year for the past two seasons has not featured in the 
club’s last three games.

After he stormed off at Southampton on New 
Year’s Day, Mourinho admitted he would listen to offers, prompting 
United to make their move.
