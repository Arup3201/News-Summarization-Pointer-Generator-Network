As Britain gets set to wind the clocks forward and prepares to welcome in the signs of summer, Japanese experts may have engineered a solution to one of its most dreaded problems - hay fever.

Scientists at the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute announced they have successfully developed the first pollen and allergy-free cedar tree.

They say by using a process called genetic recombination, which alters the DNA makeup of the plant, they were able to create region-specific trees that do not produce pollen.

Katsuaki Ishii, who led the research, said although American scientists have already created pollenless pine trees, it has never been achieved before with cedars.

The completely pollen-free trees are still in the experimental stage, but low-pollen trees have already been planted across Japan - which has recorded worsening hay fever figures in recent years, Abc News reports. 

The number of Japanese who suffer from hay fever has tripled in the last 30 years.

One in four people in Japan now suffer from hay fever every year, and pollen counts have already been especially high this year – five times higher than last spring.

Researchers have attributed this to a sudden spike in temperatures, a hot summer last year, and also a large amount of the cedar trees - known as 'Sugi'.

  An allergy causes the body’s immune 
system to see a harmless substance, as harmful, and produce antibodies 
called IgE (immunoglobulin E) to fight it.

This results in the release of 
histamine, which produces a range of conditions including itching and 
rashes, swelling, gut symptoms such as vomiting, stomach ache and 
diarrhoea, and respiratory symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, asthma, 
blocked or runny nose.

Severe cases can be life threatening — this is known as anaphylactic shock.

The lips, tongue or face can swell up 
or the throat may constrict, causing breathing difficulties that need 
urgent medical attention.

A mass of the trees were planted after World War II, in a bid to aid the post-war construction boom.

Since then, demand for the wood has dropped off, and the trees have matured and so now emit more pollen.

Japanese retailers have been reaping the benefits of the soaring pollen count however, with a host of products, including surgical masks, anti-pollen glasses, nose plugs, nasal sprays, and portable air purifiers small enough to be worn around the neck. 

Currently up to one in eight people in Britain experience moderate or severe hayfever symptoms.

Pollen counts are usually high between the start of June and the middle of July.

Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle, and contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat and sinuses to become swollen, irritated and inflamed.

There is currently no cure for hay fever but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent.

An agricultural research group is creating a hypoallergenic apple by substituting natural proteins for those which don't cause an allergic reaction.

Apples are not usually associated with allergies. However, 75 per cent of people suffering from an allergy to birch pollen are also allergic to apples.

Those sensitive to the fruit can still experience unpleasant irritation and blistering of the tongue and lips.
