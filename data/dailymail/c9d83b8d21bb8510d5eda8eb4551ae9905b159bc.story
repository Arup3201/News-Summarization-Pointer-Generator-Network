It is the book that could finally shed light on one of the world’s most keenly followed murder investigations. 

But Amanda Knox’s memoir will not appear on UK bookshelves, amid fears of legal action.

Knox served four years in an Italian jail for the 2007 murder of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Perugia.

'Waiting To Be Heard': Amanda Knox, seen weeping in court in Perugia after her conviction was overturned in 2011, has written a book about her experiences following the murder of her former flatmate Meredith Kercher

She and former boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito were freed on appeal in 2011, but last month Italy’s highest court dramatically ruled the pair must face retrial.

Knox, for now a free woman and living back in her hometown of Seattle, was due to release her memoir, Waiting to be Heard, on April 30.

She had been paid a reported $4million advance.

But UK publishers Harper Collins said after taking legal advice, the book will not be published here in the UK - although it will still be published in the U.S.

It is understood the memoir could attract legal action under the UK’s strict libel laws.

Knox has already been convicted of defaming her former boss, bar owner Patrick Lumumba, whom she accused of killing Meredith.

In a similar case, in January this year, the publication of a Scientology expose was cancelled in the UK. Publishers Transworld said, after taking legal advice, that the book was ‘not robust enough for the UK market.’

Last month the lawyer who set up Knox's multi-million dollar publishing deal hinted that the memoir contained major revelations, as he insisted publication would go ahead despite the re-trial ordered by Italy's highest court.

Robert Barnett said in an interview that certain aspects of the book would 'shock you to the core.'

The 25-year-old's first television interview, with ABC anchor Diane Sawyer, is also due to be broadcast on April 30.

Knox is said to have collapsed when she learned that she would face a retrial over the murder of Ms Kercher in a 2am phone call from her lawyer last month.

She will not voluntarily return to Italy to face trial, and is unlikely to be extradited by the U.S. As such she is expected to be tried in absentia.

Judges in Rome's supreme court accepted there were 'contradictions' in the case, quashing the acquittals of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29.

The pair, both of whom spent four years behind bars in Italy before they were freed, were informed they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old student.

Ms Kercher, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the picturesque hilltop town of Perugia.

Her throat had been slit and her semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively,

But two years later the pair were freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA evidence contaminated.

A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal.

The fact that Amanda Knox's memoir will hit the shelves in the U.S. as planned despite being pulled in the UK in light of her retrial is evidence of the vast divide between libel laws on either side of the pond.

The stringent nature of UK libel laws has led activists to campaign for changes to legislation they claim has a negative impact on freedom of expression.

Lawyers, publishers, bloggers, journalists and scientists are among those to point to the 'chilling effect' of current UK libel laws on legitimate publication, highlighting instances of 'libel tourism' - which sees wealthy individuals or corporations from overseas using the British courts to silence their critics.

Critics argue that existing English libel laws favour claimants - with the onus on the defendant to prove that they are innocent - and that the high cost of defending a libel action forces defendants to settle out of court even when they believe what they published was true.

In the U.S., in contrast, the freedom of speech and freedom of the press is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
