A new show is set to hit American TV screens next month which will see couples having sex live on air - albeit in the privacy of a camera-free soundproof booth - before sitting down in front of a studio audience to discuss it.

WE tv's Sex Box, which will premiere on February 27, features couples who are experiencing relationship woes and employs a panel of 'sexperts' to discuss these problems among themselves as the couples fornicate in the booth mere feet away.

As the newly released trailer demonstrates, once the deed is done the robed couples emerge - theoretically in a post-coital state which is believed to foster more 'honesty' - to run through their issues and glean advice from the panel.

Sex Box is the U.S. remake of a hugely successful British show of the same name, which drew in more than one million viewers when its first episode aired in October 2013.

WE tv's upcoming seven-episode run is hosted by relationship therapist Dr Fran Walfish, sex therapist Dr Chris Donaghue, Florida pastor Dr Yvonne Capehart, and comedian Danielle Stewart.

'It can take 40 minutes for a woman to be fully aroused and ready to be sexual,' Dr Donaghue tells one couple in a scene from the trailer.

'How long?' responds the shocked man, triggering a roar of laughter from the audience.

Several couples appear to dealing with issues of infidelity, with one woman admitting to 'having sex with other guys', and an emotional lesbian duo who are told by Dr Walfish: 'Trust can be rebuilt after one breach, but not if it's repeated.'

Dr Capehart tells one engaged couple after their session in the Sex Box: 'This marriage should not happen.' 

During another heart-to-heart, Dr Donague insists, 'the box changes lives', to which a male subject beams, 'I feel like a new man.'

The show's success with its American audience remains to be seen, but according to WE tv: 'Sex Box might just be the start of the next sexual revolution in the United States.'
