If you've ever wished you had a recording of incriminating audio - or had a permanent record of your own witty comeback - a new iPhone app, billed as the app that allows users to 'capture audio AFTER you've heard it' could be the answer.

The app, called Heard, records everything the iPhone microphone picks up on a constantly rotating five-minute loop.

If something happens that you want to keep a record of, 30 seconds, two minutes, or even five minutes later, you can go into the app and press 'save'. Do nothing, and the app erases the audio.

Always listening: With the click of a button, users can save audio recorded up to five minutes beforehand

Once opened, the app continues to record audio even when running in the 
background, albeit with a large red banner warning the user the software
 is operating.

In this era of surveillance, some are suspicious of the recording device. In comments made about the app on MyFoxNY, people were wary.

'There is absolutely no good reason for this app,' wrote Kyle Bradley. 'Anyone who downloads 
it and doesn't expect that they're being listened to is a fool.'

Steve Lee commented, 'Silly me, I thought the NSA already had that app on everyone's phone.'

Another comment noted that recording people without consent is illegal in many places.

'Many
 states have laws prohibiting recording of conversations without the 
express consent of those being recorded. Look for iArrests coming to a 
town near you,' wrote 'Ward Thrasher'.

Testing, testing: The new Heard app is slightly more practical for recording audio than traditional recording devices

Critics have also questioned how the app is different from the iPhone's inbuilt recording device, which like Heard can run in the background, and the app's makers point to its five-minute recording loop.

With the buffer, the user saves only the recordings they deem important, rather than saving all audio in one long, interminable file.

Once recorded, clips can be named, tagged, emailed, or shared on Facebook.

The app's homepage pronounces: 'With HEARD installed on your iPhone, you have a powerful time-shifting app that lets you grab that otherwise missed audio.

'The HEARD app runs silently (and seamlessly) in the background and - with a push of a button - the instructions/driving directions/jokes/stories/first words/laughter you would have previously missed are now captured and available on your iPhone.'

Heard launched late last week with a free version of the app that allows users to record 12 seconds of audio. For the full version with five-minute recording capability, the cost is $1.99.
