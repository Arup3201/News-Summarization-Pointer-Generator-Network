When Sean Conway took to the sea, hoping to become the first person to swim the entire length of Britain, his friends told him that the challenge would kill him.

Three million strokes later, and weighing a stone lighter, the weather-beaten adventurer managed to paddle across the finish line today.

The 32-year-old expected to steadily creep 1,000 miles northwards over an arduous two months when he left Land’s End in Cornwall on June 30.

Record: Sean Conway, 32, arriving at John O'Groats after the first ever 1,000-mile swim up Britain

Celebration: He finishes after swallowing more than 50 litres of seawater and plummeting in weight

But the warnings of his friends almost rang true, as the swimmer was forced to battle the elements over a torturous four months.

He faced a string of hazards along the way, swallowing more than 50 litres of seawater, battling bouts of seasickness and experiencing severe weight loss from the physical exertion of swimming ten miles every day.

The list of hazards even resulted in the swimmer growing a ‘ridiculous beard’ in a bid to deter jellyfish after being stung ten times on the face.

Mr Conway, from Leckhampton, Gloucestershire, had to eat pureed food during breaks from swimming as his jaw was too cold to chew. 

Adventurer: The record-breaking swim is the latest of Mr Conway's adventures. He climbed Kilimanjaro dressed as a penguin and cycled 16,000 miles through six continents in 116 days with a fractured spine

Tough: Mr Conway described himself as a 'nutter' but said the experience was 'a dream come true'

But arriving at John O’Groats – the British mainland’s most northerly point – the swimmer broke into tears as he sealed his place in the record books

He had spent just 90 days of the 136 swimming, with the remainder on dry land due to bad weather hampering his effort.

Each time he left the water – sleeping in a yacht or onshore accommodation – his coordinates were mapped and his support boat returned to the same spot to resume the swim when it was safe to do so.

Speaking after exiting the water the self-confessed ‘nutter’ described the experience as a ‘dream come true’.

Vision: Zimbabwe-born Mr Conway has fantasised about reaching the harbour - staring at photos for motivation

Emerging: Crowds gathered to see the swimmer clamber out of the waves after 136 days journeying

Bad weather: Some of the days he was forced to get on dry land to recuperate during horrific storms

Sting-protection: Mr Conway 'had to grow this ridiculous beard' in the two months he was at sea

Although his feat will not be recognised by the Guinness Book of Records, due partly to him wearing a wet suit and occasionally using flippers, he does not mind.

‘I didn’t do it for the record books,’ he said yesterday. ‘I did it for different reasons – for me, and to prove it can be done, and that anybody can do anything if they put their mind to it.

‘The hardest part was trying to deal with the weather, the cold, and jellyfish in the face. I had to grow this ridiculous beard to stop the stings.

‘Guinness felt it was too difficult to attempt, and they probably did not want to be associated with it, but I have proved a lot of doubters wrong – though I’m not sorry it’s over!’

Journey: Marching out into the Cornish sea two months ago, Mr Conway did not know what he faced

Start: Setting off from Sennen Cove Bay at the start of the Speedo Swimming Britain Challenge

Exhausted: He was met at the finish by Babette, his mother, 60, who said: 'He has a strong will and mind'

He was met at the finish of his ordeal by his mother Babette, 60, who said: ‘I’m so proud of him. This is his biggest adventure – he has a strong will and a strong mind.’

After tasting his first endurance event at the age of ten, when he swam a mile across a lake, the adventurer went on to climb Kilimanjaro dressed as a penguin and cycled 16,000 miles through six continents in 116 days, much of it with a fractured spine.

Mr Conway, who was born in Zimbabwe, revealed that he had been fantasising about swimming into the harbour, even keeping a picture on his computer to visualise the scene.

In a toast, he said: 'The hardest part was trying to deal with the weather, the cold, and jellyfish in the face'

Almost conceded: 'Just a week ago I thought I might have to give up and finish next summer,' he said

Team support: Mr Conway's team embrace him as he struggles to stand on dry land

He said: ‘I’ve been dreaming of swimming into the John O’Groats harbour for a very long time.

‘I had a screengrab of the harbour on my laptop and I’ve been looking at it for ages. To finally be here and be warm and dry and on land is a good feeling.

‘Just a week ago I thought I might have to give up and finish the attempt next summer, with the bad weather, but we had a few good weather windows and I was able to finish it.’
