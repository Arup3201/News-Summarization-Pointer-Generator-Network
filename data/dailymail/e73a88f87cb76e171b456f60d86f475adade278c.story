The political truce that helped save the Union collapsed last night as David Cameron promised ‘English votes for English laws’ once Scotland is handed new powers.

The Prime Minister sought to seize the initiative after winning the biggest gamble of his premiership, the Scottish independence referendum.

His promise to ban Scots MPs from voting on English-only issues at Westminster is also an attempt to head off a Tory revolt over extravagant promises of more powers for the Scottish Parliament in the event of a No vote.

Risk: The Prime Minister sought to seize the initiative after winning the biggest gamble of his premiership

In a 7am declaration in Downing Street yesterday, he said: ‘We have heard the voice of Scotland and now the millions of voices of England must also be heard.’

But his plan, requiring draft laws to be put before Parliament by January, was opposed by Labour, which condemned it as ‘a back of a fag packet solution’.

There was also a growing revolt in Tory circles over a separate, last-ditch funding ‘bribe’ to the Scots made by the Prime Minister.

Boris Johnson, tipped as Mr Cameron’s successor, accused him of a ‘slightly reckless promise’ to keep the generous public spending formula for Scotland that dates back to 1979.

Rattled by a nationalist surge in the opinion polls, the pro-Union parties have put forward a timetable for change:

Yesterday Ed Miliband called for a ‘constitutional convention’ at the end of 2015 involving MPs, councillors and voters in each region, as former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott attempted to revive his vision of regional assemblies.

Mr Cameron’s move, including a pledge to consider devolving powers to major English cities, leaves Labour opposing the same rights for England that it promised to Scotland.

The party will be permanently weakened if its 40 Scottish MPs are stripped of the right to vote on issues controlled by the Scottish Parliament, which will include tax, welfare, health and education.

Scottish MPs would be excluded from voting in the rest of the country’s key decisions and Scotland and England could end up with different income tax rates.

There are doubts over whether an MP representing a Scottish seat could be prime minister or chancellor, as they would have no say over laws their government proposed.

A Labour government with anything other than a landslide majority would also struggle to get measures such as Mr Miliband’s proposed new 50p top rate of tax through Parliament.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to have warned colleagues Labour’s ability to pass a Budget is at risk if plans for fast-track devolution of more powers are implemented.

Mr Cameron’s move to seize the mantle of English nationalism was also designed to spike Ukip’s guns. Leader Nigel Farage had been preparing to make the cause of English nationalism his latest battle cry.

The Prime Minister insisted: ‘The question of English votes for English laws, the so-called West Lothian question, requires a decisive answer so just as Scotland will vote separately on their issues of tax, spending and welfare, so too England as well as Wales and Northern Ireland should be able to vote on these issues.

Home rule: The Prime Minister said Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on English-only issues

‘All this must take place in tandem with and at the same pace as the settlement for Scotland.’

The Prime Minister will, however, reject calls from some Tories for a new English Parliament and Labour’s suggestion for new swathes of regional government.

Instead, the voting rights of Scottish MPs will be curtailed – though exactly how is to be hammered out by a Cabinet committee headed by Commons leader William Hague. Clauses are expected to be added to a draft Bill on devolution to Scotland to be unveiled in November and introduced in January.

Liberal Democrats suggested they will support some form of ‘English votes for English MPs’ at Westminster, as long as power is also devolved to the UK’s big cities.

Sir Menzies Campbell, former Lib Dem leader, said that although he was a Scottish MP it would be unfair if he was able to continue voting on matters ceded to the Scottish Parliament which no longer affect his constituents.

However, there are doubts over the proposed breakneck pace of reform, given that the future of Scottish MPs at Westminster once power is devolved – the West Lothian question – has been posed but unanswered for decades.

In the closing days of the referendum campaign, Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Nick Clegg signed up to a ‘vow’ drawn up by former prime minister Gordon Brown, including the ‘continuation’ of the Barnett formula.

Downing Street sources said the funding agreement – devised by Labour peer Lord Barnett in 1979 to adjust block grants to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – would become increasingly redundant as more responsibility for tax is given to the Scottish Parliament.

On Tuesday, in their desperation to secure a No vote, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg made a ‘vow’ of greater powers for Scotland in a letter to the Daily Record newspaper (right).

They wrote: ‘The Scottish Parliament is permanent and extensive new powers for the Parliament will be delivered by the process and to the timetable agreed and announced by our three parties, starting on 19th September.’

A timetable has been agreed – but not which powers will be handed over. The three parties have each put forward ideas.

Labour would put Scotland in control of 40 per cent of cash it raises. MSPs could vary income tax rates by up to 15p.

The Conservatives want to devolve all control of income tax. Scotland’s Parliament would be responsible for more than 50 per cent of its budget.

The Liberal Democrats would hand over inheritance tax, income tax and capital gains tax. Scotland would control 60 per cent of its total revenue.

The vow goes on to say that, whatever the new powers: ‘We can state categorically that the final say on how much is spent on the NHS will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.’

It says the Barnett formula will still be used to divide tax revenue between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Under this formula, Scotland gets more money per head than English regions. 

Boris leads the Tory rebellion against Scots 'bribe'

Boris Johnson last night put himself at the head of a growing Tory mutiny over David Cameron’s funding ‘bribe’ to Scotland.

The London Mayor, a contender to succeed Mr Cameron, said the Prime Minister had made a ‘slightly reckless promise’ to maintain the Barnett formula – the arrangement drawn up by a Labour peer in 1979 that ensures generous funding for Scotland.

In the closing days of the referendum campaign, Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed up to a vow drawn up by former prime minister Gordon Brown that included the continuation of the deal.

Anger on the Conservative benches has been increased by the role of Mr Brown, who appeared to be dictating the terms of eleventh-hour commitments to Scotland from the three Westminster parties.

Mr Johnson was backed by other senior Tories as he called for ‘fairness all round’ in terms of public spending. The mayor, who will seek to return to Parliament in next year’s general election, insisted: ‘You can’t have a situation where subsidies are given without some measure of fairness all round. What’s sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander.

‘We can’t just go on with a system that even Joel Barnett himself thinks is outdated.’

He suggested that Lord Barnett, 91, be asked to redesign the system so that the ‘slightly reckless promise’ to keep it could be honoured by maintaining its name.

Former environment secretary Owen Paterson demanded a recall of Parliament to discuss the implications of the promises to Scotland, a proposal rejected by Commons leader William Hague.

Mr Paterson welcomed the referendum result but said the ‘chaotic manner’ in which the No vote had been won had ‘undermined the strong and resilient United Kingdom on which we all depend’.

He added: ‘It is unacceptable that an ex-Labour leader was allowed to make rash promises ... to the Scottish people with the endorsement of all three UK party leaders, but with no mandate from Parliament.’

He said the Barnett formula led to a ‘lopsided’ constitutional settlement and if it was not resolved fairly for all parts of the UK, it ‘will fall apart’.

Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the public administration select committee, said that what was ‘right for Scotland is also right for England’.

He expected further disputes with Scottish nationalists ‘because we’ve really no idea what these promises of extra powers actually are or what is meant by honouring the Barnett formula’.

A Downing Street source said: ‘At no point have we said we intended to axe the formula.

‘We have talked this week about its continuation but that is in the context of devolving responsibility to the Scottish Parliament to raise much more of the tax they spend.

 ‘The block grant will shrink from two-thirds of Scottish spending to less than a half. So the Barnett formula will be less and less significant in terms of funding.’
