Claims: Police constable Robert Baillie is accused of failing to arrest a suspect, with his ex-wife reporting the allegations to his superiors

A love cheat policeman has appeared in court after the wife he left for a younger woman reported him for failing to arrest a suspect because he was a family friend.

A court heard that Tammy Baillie tipped off her husband Robert's superiors, telling them he had seen suspect Alexander Bett and although a warrant had been issued, failed to arrest him.

Robert Baillie, 37, an officer in Cumbernauld, near Glasgow, is also accused willfully neglecting his duties by not telling senior officers that he knew Mr Bett, 29.

Airdrie Sheriff Court heard how a probe into Baillie's conduct was launched when Mrs Baillie, who says she was 'devastated' when her husband left her for a younger woman two years ago, reported him for not arresting Bett.

The court was told that mother-of-two Mrs Baillie claimed her ex had come home from his first day on duty in April 2010 and revealed that he had been asked to apprehend Bett after a sheriff had granted a
 warrant for his arrest.

'He told me his first job was an outstanding warrant for Alex Bett,' she said.

'He said he chapped his door and did not tell his partner that he knew the family.

'Alex’s mum answered the door and was told Alex didn’t live there any more.

'Robert said he didn’t think she recognised him because he didn’t have glasses on and was in his uniform.'

Mrs Baillie, a civil servant, told 
the court she had been with her husband when they later encountered Mr Bett
 when out in Cumbernauld - but the police officer had failed to act.

'They said a passing hello to each other and just after that I asked him if the warrant was still outstanding,' she said.

'He said it was but then said that even though he was off duty, he should do something about it.'

Mrs Baillie refuted a suggestion from Shelagh McCall QC, defending, that she was a woman ‘scorned’ who was seeking revenge on her husband for leaving her in January 2012.

The court heard he had since fathered a child with his new partner.

Mrs McCall said: 'Is it not the case that when you found out about your husband’s affair, you were angry and you then threatened to ruin him?

'You told him you would finish him and he would be stacking shelves in Tesco.

'You received a letter filing for divorce and that is what motivated you to make a complaint to police about him, and it is that that motivated you to lie about this knowledge that he did not tell his partner about Alex Bett.'

Mrs Baillie said: 'No, I am telling the truth.

Tammy Baillie, pictured, told the court: 'I was devastated and upset my marriage had broken down but that had nothing to do with this, he was not acting the way a serving police officer should'

'I was devastated and upset my marriage had broken down but that had nothing to do with this, he was not acting the way a serving police officer should.'

The trial also heard Amanda Coughlan, 34, Mrs Baillie’s sister, deny defence claims she had lied to back up her sibling’s story.

Miss McCall asked her: 'You were at the Basement night club in Cumbernauld and had had a bit to

drink, you then went up to a police officer on duty outside and said to him, "my sister has got Robert Baillie by the balls and if any of you try to get involved you will be going down too”.'

Ms Coughlan replied: 'I do not remember saying that, in fact I couldn’t tell you if I was there or not, but I wouldn’t like to think I would say something like that.'

Baillie denies that between June and October 2010 at Cumbernauld Police Office and elsewhere, he wilfully neglected his duty by failing to execute when required any warrant endorsed by a sheriff relating to criminal proceedings.

He also denies wilfully neglecting his duty and violating the trust and duty of his office as a constable, failing to execute a warrant for the arrest of Alexander Bett, and failing to tell his supervising officer that he knew Bett, and he had seen him on at least one occasion in Cumbernauld.

The trial before Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has been adjourned until Friday.
