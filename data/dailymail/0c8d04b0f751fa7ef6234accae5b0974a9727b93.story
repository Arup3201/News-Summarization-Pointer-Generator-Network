An Iowa man with a history of public drunkenness was arrested again for public drunkenness, but this time with a twist.

Sean Flaherty, of Iowa City, IA, was arrested by police early Wednesday morning while naked and found near cars with broken tail lights. This was not his first run-in with the drunk tank, according to court records.

Flaherty, 42, was later arrested and blew a .83 in a post-arrest breathalyzer test.

He's a patriot: Sean Flaherty told cops he smashed out the red parts of car tail lights 'because red is bad for the republic'

When asked by Iowa City police about the broken tail lights, Flaherty is alleged to have told officers he was smashing out the red portion ‘because red means danger to the republic,’ according to KCRG.

Estimated to have caused about $600 in damage to the three cars he bashed up, the misguided patriotic faces one charge each of criminal mischief and public intoxication, according to records.

In addition to being a member of the local Democrat’s central committee, according to the station, the Iowa City man recently had a handful of charges against him dropped.

Just last month, Flaherty had a theft charge dropped after he pleaded guilty to a count of public intoxication, according to records.

A Iowa City Police spokesperson was not able to be reached for further information on Flaherty’s previous charge and local court spokesperson declined to provide any further information.
