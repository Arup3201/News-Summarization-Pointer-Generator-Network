Former Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill, who revealed this week that he had delivered the two fatal shots to Osama bin Laden, gave a motivational speech on Thursday evening - but did not mention the famous raid. 

O'Neill, 38, appeared on stage in Eastern Tennessee before a rapt audience where he told stories about combat in Afghanistan but did not mention shooting dead the al Qaeda leader.

MailOnline revealed on Thursday that Rob O'Neill, a retired 16-year veteran of the elite squad, is the man who says he shot the al-Qaeda leader in the head to kill him.

The retired SEAL, father to a ten-year-old daughter, skipped over the controversy surrounding his revelation last night and instead spoke to the audience about what he called the most 'painful' thing about being in the military.

'It's not getting shot at, or things blowing up next to you,' O'Neill said. 'It's kissing your kid goodbye for what could be the very last time and you're both aware of it.'

Although he did not mention the bin Laden raid from 2011, he alluded to the mission WBIR reported, joking at the start of his speech: 'So I've been busy preparing this speech today. I've had my phone and computer off. Anything interesting on the internet?'

The veteran received a standing ovation from the packed audience in Blount County on Thursday night and if they were disappointed to miss out on details of the 9/11 mastermind's death they gave no sign of it as they left the auditorium. 

'He was just amazing. I appreciate Mr O'Neill's service to our country,' one man said. Others called O'Neill 'inspirational'.

But O'Neill going public as the SEAL Team Six member who killed America's public enemy number one has sparked a whispering campaign from other SEALs claiming that his account of the killing is not truthful. 

His identity had been a closely-guarded secret but O'Neill is due to reveal his account in an interview with Fox News next week.

O'Neill said more and more people were becoming aware of his role and that his name was bound to become public anyway. 

Today it became clear that other SEALs are about to accuse him of lying - although there is agreement that he was on the raid.

A SEAL source told MailOnline: 'The real shooter would never discuss it publicly.

'Members of SEAL Team Six haven’t discussed it publicly so there’s a reasonable chance he’s not being truthful.

'There is no way O’Neill could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on Osama bin Laden unless his comrades all attested to it.

'But again, the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that.'

A second source told MailOnline that other SEALs were expected to speak out anonymously against O'Neill. 

Although some special operations service members and veterans are unhappy that one of their own has taken credit publicly for killing  bin Laden, others said they have gotten used to the idea that their brethren might break the code of silence and seek to profit from their deeds.

That internal debate gained intensity this week after retired Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill acknowledged that he had fired two rounds into the forehead of the al-Qaeda leader during the 2011 raid on his secret compound in Pakistan.

O'Neill had recounted his version of the bin Laden raid in February 2013 to Esquire magazine, which identified him only as 'the shooter.' 

In a story on Thursday, The Washington Post identified him by name as he described shooting the leader of the terrorist group behind the attacks of September 11, 2001.

One current and one former SEAL confirmed that O'Neill was long known to have killed bin Laden. 

Defense Department officials confirmed that O'Neill was a member of SEAL Team Six and was part of the raid but they said they could not confirm who fired the fatal shot, noting that other SEALs on the mission also fired at bin Laden.

If O'Neill discloses classified information during the interviews he could be subject to an investigation or action by the Justice Department, the Defense Department officials said.  

O'Neill told the Post that shots also were fired by two other SEAL team members, including Matt Bissonnette, who described the raid somewhat differently in his book 'No Easy Day.'

His lawyer said Bissonnette is under federal criminal investigation over whether he disclosed classified information in the book, which he did not vet with the military. In the Esquire piece, O'Neill makes no mention of Bissonnette shooting bin Laden.

Well before the Post interview, O'Neill discussed his role in the raid during a private meeting with relatives of victims of the 9/11 attack on New York's World Trade Center before the recent opening of the National September 11 Memorial Museum. He donated the shirt he was wearing in the operation, which is now on display there.

O'Neill is scheduled to be featured in lengthy segments next week on Fox News. He told the Post he decided to go public because he feared his identity was going to be leaked by others. Indeed, his name appeared on Monday on the website SOFREP, which is operated by former special operations troops. 

The actions of both O'Neill and Bissonnette have drawn scorn from some of their colleagues. In an October 31 open letter, Rear Adm. Brian Losey, who commands the Naval Special Warfare Group, and Force Master Chief Michael Magaraci, the top noncommissioned officer of the group, urged SEALs to lower their public profile. Their comments were widely perceived as being aimed at O'Neill and Bissonnette.

'At Naval Special Warfare's core is the SEAL ethos,' the letter says. 'A critical tenant of our ethos is ''I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.'''

The letter added: 'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain.'

Debra Burlingame, whose brother Charles Burlingame was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the Pentagon, attended the 9/11 museum ceremony. 

She said O'Neill, whose name was not divulged at the event, offered the families clarity on conflicting information they had received about the raid.

She said she didn't have an opinion about whether SEALs should disclose information about their deeds. 

'Whatever that (SEALs') ethos is, is between the SEALS,' she said. 'The 9/11 families are the beneficiaries of any rules he might have broken or whatever lines he might have crossed.'

'He went through the mission in really in great detail. All that information was very helpful to me because this is a figure in a terror organization that has loomed large in our lives,' she said, adding that she listened to him so intently that the 9/11 commemorative coin she was clasping tightly in her hand left a bruise.

Rick Woolard, a former SEAL team commander who previously urged his comrades to avoid discussing recent operations, said active-duty SEALs are 'pretty much very disappointed and I'd have to say angry with guys who have used their deeds and those of their companions for personal gain.'

'No Easy Day' was published in 2012 under the pseudonym Mark Owen. Bissonnette recounted on CBS's 60 Minutes that he sent a text to the commander of SEAL Team Six after its publication. He said the commander replied: 'Delete me.'

At the same time, Woolard said, there is frustration among some special operations soldiers that senior government officials have left office and written memoirs revealing and profiting from actions involving troops who are sworn to secrecy. 

However, one active-duty SEAL officer, who declined to be quoted by name because he had no permission to speak publicly, said some SEALs had grown accustomed to some of their members seeking to profit from their connections to the elite group, upon retirement.

Senior Pentagon and CIA officials cooperated extensively with the makers of Zero Dark Thirty, a film that depicted both the CIA's years-long hunt for bin Laden and the SEALs raid that killed him in Pakistan.

In the Esquire piece, O'Neill said he was one of two SEALs who went up to the third floor of the building where bin Laden was hiding. The first man fired two shots at bin Laden as he peeked out of the bedroom, but O'Neill says those shots missed. The man then tackled two women in the hallway outside of bin Laden's bedroom.

O'Neill went into the bedroom, he recounts. 'There was bin Laden standing there. He had his hands on a woman's shoulders, pushing her ahead, not exactly toward me but by me, in the direction of the hallway commotion. It was his youngest wife, Amal.'

O'Neill added: 'In that second, I shot him two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again. Bap! Same place. ... He was dead.'
