A mother who lost 19 stone thanks to weight loss surgery she now bitterly regrets the operation after it left her in constant pain and with less confidence than before. 

Kelly Urey, 30, now suffers from crippling stomach pains which leave her barely able to eat, meaning she is constantly frail and tired.

She has also left with unsightly excess skin, which she says makes her feel less confident than when she was obese. 

Despite several medical consultations, doctors cannot find anything wrong with her - and say the the problem is all in her head.  

Kelly Urey, 30, ballooned to 26st and eventually doctors recommended her for a gastric bypass operation. She lost 19 stone in 18 months (right). But she now says she deeply regrets the operation  after it left her in constant pain and with less confidence than before

After the gastric bypass procedure, Ms Urey slimmed down to a size eight, but says she has been left with unsightly and saggy excess skin (pictured), making her feel less attractive than before. She claims she is barely able to eat and has shrunk to a skeletal seven stone

Ms Urey shrunk from a size 30 to a size eight dress size in the space of just 18 months.

Now weighing a skeletal seven stone, she says she is malnourished and easily exhausted.

She said: 'I might look good now - but I feel awful. I don't have as much energy as when I was obese and I actually feel less attractive.'

Ms Urey, of Bury, began gaining weight when she was a teenager thanks to her habit of snacking frequently on crisps, chocolate and soft cheese between regular takeaway dinners.

She said despite her size she was confident in social situations.

She said: 'People saw me as a larger-than-life character. I would often make jokes about my size so others wouldn't get the satisfaction of making fun of me.'

When she reached her twenties Ms Urey realised her weight was causing noticeable health issues, including frequent shortness of breath.

After consulting a GP and dietician she was put forward for gastric bypass surgery.

Doctors warn complications of the surgery include internal bleeding, a blood clot inside the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs (pulmonary embolism).

Despite these potential complications, Ms Urey decided to proceed with the surgery, going under the knife in October 2012.

Ms Urey says she was a 'larger than life' character before her bypass (pictured) and actually had more energy

Initially, she was happy losing weight after the surgery, but soon found eating was so painful she needed painkillers with each meal

She said: 'I was nervous. Any surgery is nerve-racking but it was the end result which concerned me the most.'

After her gastric bypass Ms Urey was initially pleased with her weight loss, but as the pounds tumbled away she became less and less fond of her new physique.

She discovered even the smallest of food portions would leave her in immense pain.

She said: 'I was happy with how quickly the weight fell off but alarmingly it never slowed down.

'I found every bite of food would knot my stomach in crippling agony and I had to pop a painkiller just to eat a small amount of scrambled egg.'

Ms Urey, has been left with nausea, bloating, cramping, diarrhoea,dizziness, and fatigue. She has also been left with unsightly and uncomfortable excess skin.

She said: 'I'm just too weak. I thought I would have more energy but I'm in too much pain now. '

When Ms Urey realised the extent of her discomfort she decided to seek medical attention.

She said: 'I went to the GP but they said they couldn't find anything wrong with me.

'I told them it hurt too much to eat but it was no use. Medics concluded the pain was all in my head. I felt helpless.'

Due to her stomach pains Ms Urey can only usually stomach soft foods, preventing her from getting all the nutrients she needs for a healthy diet.

Her typical daily diet now consists of two oat bars for breakfast, a piece of fruit and tub of yoghurt for lunch.

For dinner she typically eats some salad with flavoured humus or salted popcorn.

Despite her health issues, she is looking towards the future, having enrolled in a hairdressing course at Bury College.

She said: 'I needed a practical hobby and the hairdressing course gives me a few hours of the day to get away from it all and it will give me some job prospects once my health improves.

'I have to stop over-thinking things, I have to stop looking at food and getting worried about the pain. I just need to make sure I eat my three meals.

'I still wish I had never had gastric bypass surgery.

'I want others to think it through before they go ahead with such procedures.'

The NHS recently reported that the number of gastric bypasses performed in the UK has gone up by 530 per cent in the last six years.

A gastric bypass is where the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach so a person digests less food and it takes much less food to make them feel full

Privately, it costs £9,500-15,000, but is available on the NHS to to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity.

It is offered when other treatments, such as lifestyle changes, haven't worked.

People with a gastric bypass will lose around two-thirds of their excess body weight 

They will need to stick to a rigorous and lifelong plan afterwards to avoid putting weight back on or long-term complications.

This plan will include a carefully controlled diet and regular exercise.

There are known risks to the surgery, including internal bleeding, a blood clot inside the leg (deep vein thrombosis) and a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs (pulmonary embolism)

The rapid weight loss may cause relationship problems, for example with a partner who is also obese, and it may lead to unwanted loose folds of skin, which may need further surgery to correct.

Also, many people with mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety, find that these problems do not automatically improve because they have lost weight.
