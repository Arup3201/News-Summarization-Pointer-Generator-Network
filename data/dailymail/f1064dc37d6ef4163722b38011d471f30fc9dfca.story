One of two brothers from central New York accused of conning a man out of a winning $5 million scratch-off ticket was found guilty today of possessing the stolen ticket, but the pair were acquitted of conspiring to cheat him.

Andy Ashkar, 35, faces up to three years in prison after being found guilty of possession of stolen property.

But Ashkar and his 37-year-old brother, Nayel, were cleared of conspiracy charges by Onondaga County Court Judge Joseph Fahey in Syracuse.

Andy was remanded to custody. Defense
attorney Robert Durr said he would consult with Ashkar and his family 
and decide whether to appeal.

'I
don't know what's going to happen as a result of the court's decision,'
Durr said. 'My client has some options that he can explore. We'll see 
what they want to do.'

Andy Ashkar faces a minimum of one to three years in prison when he is sentenced May 29.

Police
and lottery officials said the Ashkar brothers convinced Robert Miles, a
maintenance worker, that the ticket was worth only $5,000 when Miles 
bought it in 2006.

Authorities
say the brothers paid Miles $4,000, took a $1,000 handling fee, then 
waited until the ticket was about to expire before trying to claim the 
jackpot in 2012.

Andy, of Camillus, came forward on 
March 1, 2012, just 11 days before the '$500,000,000 Extravaganza' 
scratch-off card would have expired, New York Lottery initially said.

Lucky win: Andy Ashkar bought the ticket at his parents' convenience store in Syracuse in 2006, pictured

Andy Ashkar testified on Friday, the 
final day of the trial, that he went to his father's store for lunch on 
Oct. 27, 2006, and bought the winning ticket, which cost $20, while he 
was there.

'I scratched it 
on the customer side of the counter,' Ashkar said, then handed it to his
father. 'He scanned it. He said, 'Shut up!' He didn't want anyone to 
know.'

Ashkar said he 
planned to go to the lottery office that day, then changed his mind, 
called his brother and went to his parents' home.

'I
was hesitant. I wanted to do it the right way,' said Ashkar, who was 
unemployed and receiving public assistance at the time. 'I didn't want 
it to have a negative impact on my family.'

Andy Ashkar said he waited nearly six years because he was worried for his family's safety.

Their
convenience store, the Green Ale Market, a nondescript one-story 
cinderblock building just east of downtown Syracuse, is located in a 
crime-ridden neighborhood.

Miles testified during the week-long non-jury trial that Andy Ashkar had taken the ticket from him.

Miles
said he wasn't thinking clearly that day because he had been high on 
crack cocaine the night before. He said he never got a receipt.

Miles was not in court for the verdict.

'I'm
amazed, ecstatic,' prosecutor Beth Van Doren said. 'Rob Miles was 
really close when he said, 'Who would believe an ex-addict?' Our office 
believed him. Some say a dollar and a dream. For Rob Miles, it was 20 
bucks and a nightmare for six years.'

The
Ashkars' father, Nayef, owns the store that sold the ticket and is 
charged with conspiracy. He has a separate trial scheduled for 
September.

State lottery officials have said they don't want to address the jackpot until all court proceedings are over.

'I'm so confident they'll do the right thing,' Van Doren said.

The brothers' mother, Wasa Ashkar, said she and her husband were 
Palestinians from Jerusalem who immigrated to the United States nearly 
40 years ago and have owned the store for 12 years.
