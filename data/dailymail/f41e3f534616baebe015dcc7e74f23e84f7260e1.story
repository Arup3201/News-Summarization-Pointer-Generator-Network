Profits at the fashion chain Next are set to overtake Marks & Spencer for the first time in a  milestone for the chain and the high street.

A successful Christmas means it is on course to announce a rise of at least 12 per cent for 2013, which would take the figure to around £700million.

This puts it on course to make more money than M&S, which is predicted to see underlying annual pre-tax profits fall to £628million.

Profits booming: The latest financial figures from Next represent a remarkable rise for the 34-year-old chain

The figures represent a remarkable 
rise for a fashion chain that began only 34 years ago, compared to 
M&S’s 210-year history.

Marks
 & Spencer has failed to win back customers, with the clothes in its
 Leading Ladies ad campaign – featuring the likes of Dame Helen Mirren 
and Darcey Bussell – criticised for lacking glamour, while its spring 
collection was said to be unappealing to its core market.

That
 is in direct contrast to Next, which is lauded for giving customers 
what they want, and appears prepared to embrace high-end fashion – using
 top models and taking inspiration from  leading designers.

The Next 
Directory catalogue and online store have been central to its success 
amid a remarkable rise in the number of people buying fashion on the 
internet.

At one time, the 
idea of buying clothes on the web without trying them on first seemed 
ridiculous, but this is now the fastest growing of all internet sales.

Some 21.2 per cent of all clothes and 26.3 per cent of shoes are now bought through online stores.

Marks
 & Spencer has recently re-launched its own website – a 
multi-million-pound make-over including catwalk videos and mix and match
 outfit suggestions – in a bid to cash in on the shift in shopping 
habits.

Next had a 
particularly good Christmas, in contrast to M&S and the rest of the 
high street. Sales were up 11.9 per cent in the eight weeks before 
Christmas compared to the year before.

The online only fashion store ASOS has taken a huge bite out of the sales of bricks and mortar chains

The
 company managed to hold its shelf prices while many other big stores, 
including M&S, were running promotions to get people through the 
door. Sales via its directory and online division rose by 21 per cent in
 the festive trading period.

Analysts say Next’s sales figures were driven by areas such as knitwear and sleepwear, as well as strong growth in homeware.

It
 overtook M&S in terms of stock market value in 2012 and it now sits
 at some £10.2billion compared to £7.5billion for M&S.

Next,
 which has around 500 stores, plans to expand its retail space by 4 per 
cent during 2014, while also increasing its online business in the UK 
and overseas. It plans to launch a site in China this year.

The
 shift to the web is also likely to be reflected in strong figures this 
week from online fashion store ASOS, which has taken a huge bite out of 
high street sales.

The group
 achieved sales of £335.7million in the four months to December 31. The 
figure  from the UK alone rose 37 per cent, while sales overseas were up
 by 38 per cent.

ASOS, which
 stands for As Seen on Screen, is aimed at ‘fashion forward 
twenty-somethings’, and has steadily expanded around the world.

It recently launched in China and is expected to hit its target of £1billion in total sales this financial year.

It's no surprise that Next has finally overtaken ailing M&S.

Both stores have long been trying to throw off their reputation of selling slightly dowdy workwear and frumpy casual clothes.

M&S hired fashion guru Belinda Earl to revamp its collections, but went off-mark with its Leading Ladies ad campaign, which was derided for looking dowdy despite its celebrity cast.

Worse, the spring collection, which was filled with crop tops and acid floral prints, was panned for being unlikely to appeal to its core market of middle-aged women.

Next has been far more savvy, and listened to customers.

The key message seems to have been that they were prepared to pay more for quality classics inspired by the catwalk.

On the Next website you’ll find neat office dresses that are dead ringers for Roland Mouret designs and cost £35.

The designs are carefully cut and conscious of what older women want: there’s plenty of sleeves, nipped-in waists, control slips and flattering cuts in classic colours.

Better yet, alongside its own collections, Next has started selling brands such as Ultimo, Hobbs and Diesel.

Not only does this make its own clothes seem more desirable, but gives customers an added incentive to buy from them.

Next has also stuck with its Directory (every woman was on the mailing list in the Eighties), but added a day delivery service that gives you the option to shop until 10pm and still receive your outfit the following day.

Lastly, in contrast to M&S, Next has returned to using top models. The Directory of the Eighties featured Linda Evangelista and Yasmin Le Bon on its cover, and the current one has new face Bette Franke doing the same job – making their high street clothes look like haute couture.

No wonder women are flocking back.
