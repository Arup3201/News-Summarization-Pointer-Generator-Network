Nigerian rescue workers today dug into the rubble of the market destroyed in a car bomb attack attack which has killed at least 118 people.

Most victims of the attack in Jos, central Nigeria, are women and children who worked at the market, said Mohammed Abdulsalam of the National Emergency Management Agency.

'We expect to find more bodies in the rubble,' he said. The search for survivors was called off last night after fires lit by the explosions became too fierce.

Earthmovers were this afternoon demolishing buildings weakened by the blasts and resultant fires and moved heavy debris, allowing rescuers to search for more of the dead.

'Allahu akhbar!' some young Muslim men yelled provocatively at an AP photographer near the scene, as suspicions grew that Islamist militant group Boko Haram carried out the attack.

Gloria Paul was among a handful of people searching for loved ones at Bingham University Teaching Hospital.

She was looking for her husband but all she had found was his car parked near Terminus Market, its windows all shattered.

Next to the bomb site, dozens of wailing people crowded outside the morgue at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, waiting their turn to see if relatives and loved-ones were among the dead.

Security forces cordoned off the area of mounds of rubble, burned-out vehicles and smashed buildings with the debris of panic scattered around - a sandal here, a hat there.

Exploded mangoes and pineapples rotted in the sun, their sickly sweet smell mixing with the stench of rotting human flesh.

A charred engine block was all that remained of the grain-filled truck that held the second bomb. Police anti-bomb squad officers investigated a crater left by one of the blasts.

The second blast came half an hour after 
the first, designed to kill rescue workers who had rushed to the 
scene.

The search for survivors was halted last night by fires ignited in buildings by the blasts, the echoes of which were heard miles away.

Firefighters battled through the night to douse the flames that consumed buildings, Mr Abdulsalam told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

At least 118 bodies were delivered to hospital morgues yesterday, and 64 people were being treated in hospital, he said.

President Goodluck Jonathan indicated that he blames Boko Haram for Tuesday's attack, assuring Nigerians their government 'remains fully committed to winning the war against terror.'

Two car bombs exploded in the mostly Christian city of Jos, Nigeria, killing at least 118. The attack bears all the hallmarks of extremist Muslim group Boko Haram

Second blast was timed to go off half an hour after the first in order to kill rescue workers helping the wounded

Just last month Boko Haram killed 120 and injured at least 200 in the Nigerian capital of Abuja

While nobody has claimed responsibility 
for the attacks, the double blast bears all the hallmarks of tactics 
used by militant Islamic group Boko Haram.

A market official said he helped remove 50 casualties, most of them dead. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to give information to reporters. 

'It's horrifying, terrible,' said Mark 
Lipdo of the Stefanos Foundation, a Christian charity based in Jos, who
 said he could smell burning flesh.

Lipdo said at least one of the bombs could have been averted if authorities had acted in time.

He said a white van that held the 
first bomb was parked for hours in the market place, raising suspicions 
of vendors and others who reported it to the authorities, but nothing 
was done.

Boko Haram's terrorist insurgency has killed more than 2,000 people this year alone after the government vowed to crack down on the Islamic group

Boko Haram, whose name means Western education is sinful, want to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria controlled by Sharia Law

Witnesses at the scene report bodies and body parts laying in the road covered with grain which was packed around one of the bombs when it went off

He said authorities also had another 
warning of impending violence: a man with explosives strapped to his 
body was arrested on Saturday and told police that many militants had 
been ordered to plant bombs around churches and public areas in Jos.

Dozens of bodies and body parts were covered in grain that had been loaded in the second car bomb, witnesses said.

Photographs showed a woman's body, legs blown off, on the edge of an inferno consuming other bodies, with a hand reaching out of the flames.

Another woman, unconscious, was being carried away in a wheelbarrow on a road strewn with glass shards.

The second bomb was detonated half an hour after the first, and was designed to kill rescue workers who came to help the wounded

Tensions have been rising between Christians and Muslims in the city, in Nigeria's Middle Belt region that divides the country into the predominantly Muslim north and Christian south.

Boko Haram has claimed other recent bomb attacks, including two separate bomb blasts in April that killed more than 120 people and wounded more than 200 in Abuja, the nation's capital.

A suicide car bomber killed 25 people in northern Kano city on Monday. Police there detonated a second car bomb Monday.

They said both would have killed many people but the first exploded before it reached its target of restaurants and bars in the Christian quarter of the Muslim city.

Yesterday President Goodluck Jonathan extended sympathies to affected families and promised a bigger force to fight the Islamists.

In a statement, the Nigerian government 'assures all Nigerians that government remains fully committed to winning the war against terror, and this administration will not be cowed by the atrocities of enemies of human progress and civilization.'

The government and military's failure to curtail the five-year-old Islamic uprising, highlighted by the continuing mass abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls has caused national and international outrage.

Jonathan has been forced to accept help from several nations including Britain and the United States in the hunt for the girls, who were taken in northeast Nigeria, with threats to sell them into sexual slavery.

According to charity worker Mark Lipdo, stall owners in the market had reported a suspicious white van to police hours before the bombs went off, but nothing was done

Around 2,000 people have been killed in Nigeria this year alone. In April two more bomb blasts in the capital of Abuja killed more than 120 people and injured an estimated 200

The mostly Christian city of Jos is in Nigeria's Middle Belt, which divides the Christian north from the Muslim south

It also has brought attention to the shadowy extremist group, which is demanding the release of detained insurgents in exchange for the girls - a swap officials say the government will not consider.

Diplomats said Nigeria on Tuesday asked a U.N. Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against al-Qaida to add Boko Haram to the list, with an arms embargo and asset freeze.

Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is sinful' wants to turn Nigeria into an Islamic state under Shariah law.

Half of Nigeria's population of 170million is Christian, as is most of the population of Jos.

Despite a year-old state of emergency being declared in three of Nigeria's provinces, the militants attacks have become more lethal and more widespread in 2014.

On Christmas Eve in 2010, bombs allegedly planted by Boko Haram exploded in Jos, killing as many as 80 people, meanwhile more than 300 people have been killed in assaults on towns and villages in recent weeks.

The group recently captured 300 schoolgirls and is threatening to sell them into the sex trade if prisoners are not released (pictured, Martha Mark with picture of her missing daughter, Monica)

Extremists have also been blamed for an attack on a Chinese camp in neighbouring Cameroon last week in which one Cameroonian soldier was killed and 10 Chinese workers abducted.

The Senate on Tuesday voted to extend the emergency for another six months but only if Jonathan agrees to spend more money arming soldiers, who say Boko Haram is better equipped.

More than 2,000 people have been killed in the insurgency this year in Africa's most populous nation, compared to an estimated 3,600 between 2010 and 2013.
