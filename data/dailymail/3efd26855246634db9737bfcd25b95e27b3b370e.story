Supporters are being asked to part with extortionate amounts of money to watch Arsenal in this weekend's FA Cup final, with some tickets going for close to £1,700.

The Gunners are aiming to end their nine-year trophy drought at Wembley against Hull City.

They were handed an allocation of just 25,000 by the FA - meaning thousands of fans have been left scratching around for over-priced tickets.

Not happy! Arsenal supporters are being charged extortionate amounts of money ahead of this weekend

The one they all want to be at: Arsenal face Hull City in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday

Some online venders are asking for almost 40 times more than the cheapest available initially on sale; that's before tax and extra costs are factored in.

Forty thousand tickets have been given to Club Wembley members and sponsors, among other groups.

And that means supporters find themselves at the mercy of inflated pricing.

Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis was less than impressed at the number of tickets available for fans - although that isn't a policy that's recently been changed.

'We are disappointed many of our supporters and also those of Hull City will be unable to get tickets to the Cup final,' he said.

'The balance in the FA's allocation isn't right. There will be many disappointed fans - who have supported the club home and away for years - who will be unable to get a ticket to this historic match.'
