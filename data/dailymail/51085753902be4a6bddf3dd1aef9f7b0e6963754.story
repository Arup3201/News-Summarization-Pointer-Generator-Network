A retired BBC producer arrested in 
the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal has admitted he knew the star was a paedophile but 'wouldn't have dreamed of him grassing up'.

Wilfred De'ath, 75, was told yesterday he will not face charges after being accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl - now a famous British actress - in the 1960s.

Defending himself today he said he was 'innocent', adding: 'We were all womanisers in those days but no girl I ever slept with was under age.

'It was a different culture in the mid-sixties. Sexual matters were taken much more lightly, there wasn't the 
sensitivity that there is now.'

Wilfred De'ath was was kept on bail for more than three months over an historic sex assault allegation but was later cleared

Mr De'ath was held by Operation Yewtree detectives, a Scotland Yard probe launched after the Top Of The Pops presenter's decades of abuse was revealed.

But the Crown 
Prosecution Service (CPS) said yesterday that there was not enough 
evidence to charge the 75-year-old.

In an interview today Mr De'ath admitted he had challenged Savile about spending a night in a hotel with a girl as young as 10 years old.

'I confronted him on the evening of 
transmission, I did say that to him, I said "I think you are living 
dangerously". He said "oh, no, no, no" and he just brushed me off,' he told the Today Programme.

'I was pretty shocked and disgusted. I, 
at that time, was a happily married man with my wife and daughter in 
Hampstead (London) and I was pretty shocked and appalled.

‘I was physically frightened of Savile. He was a boxer and a wrestler. I wouldn’t have dreamed of grassing him up.

Jimmy Savile is one of the UK's most prolific abusers and has sparked an investigation into sexual activity at the BBC

'I do slightly regret it but then it was
common talk in the corridors of Broadcasting House. It was common talk 
that he liked young girls.

'I keep saying this but the culture in 
those days was so different, it would never have occurred to me to go to
the head of the department.

'I am pretty disgusted, if I am honest with myself I am full of self loathing that I didn't do anything about it at the time.'

Mr De'ath launched a scathing attack on police last night after being told he will not face charges.

He was told he will not be 
prosecuted after the complainant, once a relatively well-known actress, 
withdrew her statement and said she was not willing to give evidence in 
court alone.

She claimed Mr De’ath groped 
her thighs as they sat in a cinema in the 1960s when she was 14. She 
came forward after he was interviewed as part of a TV documentary about 
Savile’s past.

Mr De’ath said he had met the girl 
briefly at a party but had never gone to a cinema with her or assaulted 
her. Earlier this month he said he had ‘a feeling of vindictiveness’ 
towards the now elderly actress.

He had produced a Savile radio show but the allegations against him were unconnected to the disgraced paedophile.

Mr De’ath, from Cambridge, is the 
first of 11 people arrested as part of the controversial Operation 
Yewtree investigation to learn his fate. He said he has endured a ‘very,
very unpleasant experience. I feel very indignant, I’m still very 
angry’.

He added: ‘I feel very bitter – I’m totally innocent.’

was arrested and bailed in October

He accused the 
authorities of a ‘perversion of justice’ after he was kept on bail for 
more than three months over a sex assault allegation dating back almost 
half a century.

He was 
arrested by seven officers at 7am at his flat on Remembrance Sunday last
year as he prepared to go to church, after being accused of assaulting a teenage girl in the 1960s.

'They failed miserably, you have to 
admit that, they failed lamentably in the case of Jimmy Savile. They 
failed to get him when they could have got him.

'It seems to me they are kind of over, I think you know what I am trying
to say, they have gone too far the other way now and they are arresting
people on rather spurious allegations'.

Arrest: Wilfred De'Ath at home in Cambridgeshire, which was raided by seven officers last year

Mr De'ath said he understood the police had been 'only doing their job' but he believed they were 'over zealous'.

Chief Crown Prosecutor Alison Saunders said that the case could not be pursued without the witnesses statement as there was not enough evidence

'My general comment would be that Operation Yewtree has gone too far," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'As Jim Davidson says it is getting silly now. It really is getting silly.'

He also questioned why it was 
necessary for a team of officers to arrest him over such historic claims
and accused Scotland Yard of allowing ‘political correctness’ to 
‘outweigh common sense’.

A friend of his compared the behaviour
of investigators to that of the secret police in Communist East Germany
and the Soviet Union.

The friend added: ‘At a time when 
known drug-dealers, murderers and other real criminals escape 
prosecution because of a lack of certainty of conviction, it has to be 
asked why this sorry affair ever took place.

'Did the Yewtree team really
believe they could and should make a prosecution stick concerning an 
alleged incident from nearly half a century ago to which there were no 
witnesses?’

Alison Saunders, of the Crown 
Prosecution Service, said the woman voluntarily withdrew her statement: 
‘She said that as she would be the only complainant to give evidence if 
the matter went to trial, she did not want to pursue it.

‘She confirmed she came to this conclusion of her own free will.’

Others who have been arrested as part 
of Yewtree are DJ Dave Lee Travis, paedophile Gary Glitter, celebrity PR
Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson.

In January Esther Rantzen, the founder
of Childline, criticised the inquiry, saying police were targeting the 
wrong people and creating confusion among victims.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
