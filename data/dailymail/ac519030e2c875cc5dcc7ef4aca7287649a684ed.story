Around 120 prisoners have escaped from a jail in Libya after security guards allegedly accepted bribed to release them.

Libya's Supreme Security Committee said the mass break-out happened at one of the main prisons in the capital city of Tripoli.

Spokesman Abdel-Moneim al-Hurr said only two of the 120 have been arrested since their escape from Jdeida prison yesterday. It is the second jailbreak in Tripoli this year.

Mr Al-Hurr said no security guards were injured during the escape and it is believed guards through the keys into one of the cells.

He said: 'We don't know why the policeman threw the keys into the prison. We've been able to catch only seven of the prisoners so far.'

Jdeida prison is the biggest jail in Libya and falls under the jurisdiction of the interior ministry.

Hurr said the prisoners were in jail for crimes such as murder and rape, many of them were serving sentences issued by judges under the Gaddafi administration.

He said: 'This incident shows how weak the police system is in western Libya where we haven't been able to gauge the loyalties of all the security officials working for the government.'

claim the courts have not moved to hear their cases.

The North African country has been reeling from a security breakdown and a weakened judiciary following last year's eight-month civil war.

The news comes as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took responsibility for security at the U.S. consulate in Libya where an attack by extremists last month killed the US ambassador and three other Americans.

There are three separate investigations into the attack going on now: an FBI probe into the deaths of the four Americans, an independent inquiry by a panel appointed by Mrs Clinton and the congressional hearings.

Ambassador Chris Stevens was among the four killed in the attack, which came on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington.

Pushing back against Republican criticism of the Obama administration for its handling of the situation, Mrs Clinton said in Lima, Peru, that security at all of America's diplomatic missions abroad is her job, not that of the White House.

She told CNN: 'I take responsibility. I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world (at) 275 posts.

'The president and the vice president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.'
