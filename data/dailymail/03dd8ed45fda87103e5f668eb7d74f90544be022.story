A Florida man has been arrested for secretly recording illicit videos of a woman who was renting a room in his marital home.Â 

The tenant discovered her landlord's perverse scheme when she borrowed his computer and discovered naked pictures of herself stored in a file labeled 'Porn,' as well as a host of nude images of girls as young as age seven, according to the Sun Sentinel.

William Anthony Raber, 27, was arrested Saturday and charged with one felony count of video voyeurism and 17 child pornography charges.

He is being held on $162,000 bond.

Raber reportedly admitted to using a small black camera to record videos of the tenant, who had been paying $350 a month to live in a room of his home with his wife since mid April. He also admitted to downloading the child pornography.

The tenant told police that on Raber's computer, she found four video recordings of herself nude and in the process of getting dressed in her bedroom.

She reported her findings to police and then copied the images onto a flash drive as evidence.

The Sun Sentinel reports that there were 42 files on the flash drive, including a recording of a young girl engaged in various sex acts with an adult man.

The tenant rented out a room in this home in Tamarac, Florida, where Raber lives with his wife
