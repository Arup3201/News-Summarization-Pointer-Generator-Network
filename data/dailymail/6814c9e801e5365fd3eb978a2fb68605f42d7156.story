A radical 30ft high bamboo 'flower basket' could help give water to underdeveloped areas, it has been claimed.

The structure harnesses condensation from the air using a specially-developed material.

Called WarkaWater, its Italian inventor hopes it could bring drinking water to villages in Africa.

Helping to end thirst: WarkaWater  is a project conceived for the mountainous regions in Ethiopia, where women and children walk several hours to collect water. The 9 metre tall bamboo framework (mock-ups pictured) has a special fabric hanging inside capable to collect drinkable water

The name ‘WarkaWater’ comes from the Warka Tree, a giant wild fig tree native to Ethiopia, traditionally used for public gatherings and school education.

These trees are a very important part of the ecosystem and culture of Ethiopia and its disappearance seems unfortunately unavoidable.

In many areas, they are known as the 'source of life'

'WarkaWater is designed to provide clean water as well as ensure long-term environmental, financial and social sustainability,' designer Arturo Vittori told Wired.

'Once locals have the necessary know how, they will be able to teach other villages and communities to build the WarkaWater towers.'

Each nine-metre tower costs approximately $550 (£330) and can be built in under a week with a four-person team and locally available materials.

They are designed for areas where digging wells is not possible.

'WarkaWater' is a project conceived for the mountainous regions in Ethiopia, where women and children walk several hours to collect water, the designers said.

The bamboo framework has a specially-engineered fabric hanging inside it, capable of collect fresh water extracting condensation from the air.

The lightweight structure can be constructed, lifted and fixed to the ground without special machinery

The tower can also be equipped with a solar-powered LED to provide illumination at night, giving the chance to children to study after sunset and also supporting the social space in the village in the evening

The lightweight structure can be built with local skills and materials by the village inhabitants.

Vittori hopes to have two WarkaTowers erected in Ethiopia by 2015 and is looking for financial rainmakers who'd like to seed these tree-inspired structures across the country.

The tower is built in sections installed from top down, so no scaffolding is needed.

The lightweight structure can be constructed, lifted and fixed to the ground without special machinery.

The stable triangular framework  of the tower is achieved by connecting the bamboo either with natural fibre, plastic or metal wires.

The fog-harvesting fabric can be lovered for maintenance, but also to indicate the availability of water from far.

The tower can also be equipped with a solar-powered LEDto provide illumination at night, giving the chance to children to study after sunset and also supporting the social space in the village in the evening.

In further developments muscle powered energy can be produced by people while gathering under the tree, the team say.
