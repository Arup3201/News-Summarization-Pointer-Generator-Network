FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein maintains it is important to award World Cups to countries that have not hosted them before despite the controversy surrounding the decision to stage the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

FIFA awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively in 2010, but a report was commissioned amid allegations by the Sunday Times that disgraced former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam had made payments to football officials in return for votes for Qatar.

FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia submitted his report into the bidding contests in May and, while he would not be drawn on speculation that the 2022 World Cup could be hosted elsewhere if evidence of corruption was uncovered, Prince Ali insists it is essential for all the world's regions to experience staging a World Cup.

Reason: FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein insists it's vital that the World Cup has new hosts

Concern: There are fears that Qatar was the wrong choice for the 2022 World Cup and won't deliver the goods

Project: Qatar plan to accomodate all the visitors for the World Cup with state of the art facilities

Finished product: The stadium proposals have state of the art designs to make their facilities excellent

'I was not there at the time that these bids were made so I can't really comment on that (the 2022 World Cup being moved). I think the important thing is that we have two wonderful World Cups coming up in the future,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme.

'It's very important to take it to different parts of the world, I'm a firm believer in that, so let's just hope that if it's done in the right way and everything is satisfactory in order to kick off then let's go for it, whatever the decisions are that come up.'

Prince Ali, who is also president of the Jordan Football Association, went on to speak of his pride over the World Cup coming to his continent in eight years' time - provided everything is above board.

He said: 'It's always a good thing when a World Cup is hosted in your continent. Having said that, we're very proud to be hosting in Jordan the Under-17 Women's World Cup in 2016, so I'm very happy if it comes to our region as long as it's done in the proper and correct way and hopefully things will go in the direction we want.'
