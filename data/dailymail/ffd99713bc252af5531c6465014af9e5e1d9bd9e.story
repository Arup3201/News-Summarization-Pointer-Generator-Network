From bitterns and badgers in Suffolk to bald eagles and bears in Canada – what a contrast! 

I’d just finished this year’s BBC Springwatch series at the RSPB’s Minsmere reserve in Suffolk so it was time for a family holiday, and there was a trip I’d been looking forward to for a long time.

Over the years I’ve been very spoiled, travelling all over the world filming wildlife, and there are certain places I put on my bucket list to go back to with my family – partner Nick and our son Ollie.

Knight Inlet in British Columbia was one of them.

It’s a special place, a floating lodge in the middle of the wilderness, accessible only by boat or float plane and one of the best places in British Columbia to see grizzly bears.

I’d filmed there a couple of times, about ten years ago. The first time was for a show called Animal Planet. We went in August during the salmon run and filmed the grizzlies fishing and gorging in the river. It was an amazing sight.

The second time was for a series called Michaela’s Wild Challenge when I was given two tasks – to see a grizzly baby and to get a ‘kiss’ from a hummingbird.

Knight Inlet is a stopping point for Rufous hummingbirds on migration and after a lot of patience, sitting next to a hummingbird feeder with red lipstick and sugar on my lips, I did actually complete that particular challenge.

Staying at Knight Inlet involves a three to five-day package, and with British Columbia such a long way to go – especially when you live in Cape Town, as we do – I left it to the Canada experts, Discover the World, to create a two-week trip around my ‘bucket-list’ destination.

We started off in Vancouver, which is a fabulous city. It’s easy to see why it’s considered one of the top five places in the world to live. Surrounded by beaches, ocean, mountains and greenery, it reminded us of Cape Town. We stayed in English Bay, near the beach and right beside Vancouver’s famous Stanley Park. It’s a stunning place, with nearly 1,000 acres of west coast rainforest, a smattering of manicured lawns, beautiful gardens, sports fields, an outdoor pool and a six-mile sea wall.

It’s a green playground in the heart of the city and incredibly well organised – to avoid accidents the sea wall has a one-way path for cyclists and another for runners. Amazingly, everybody sticks to the rules!

In all we spent five days in Vancouver, two at the start of our trip and three at the end. We did a sightseeing tour the first day that took us to the Capilano Suspension Bridge as well as Stanley Park, Gastown, Granville Island Market and a few other ‘must-see’ spots. It was very touristy but gave us a quick overview of the city. We particularly loved the suspension bridge, which is 450ft long, 230ft high and wonderfully wobbly!

We went on a boat ride in Howe Sound, a trip up Grouse Mountain – where we saw a very funny lumberjack show – hired bikes for a day and enjoyed a lovely harbour dinner cruise. Vancouver is an uncomplicated place to get around. People are incredibly friendly, and although cities are not really my thing, we really enjoyed it.

Apart from seeing grizzly bears, I wanted to show the family orcas, and Vancouver Island – across a sea strait from the city of Vancouver – is a great place to see them. There are two top spots, Victoria, the main city on Vancouver Island, and Telegraph Cove, a more quirky town, full of character and history, tucked away on the east coast of the island.

Vancouver's oldest neighbourhood, Gastown, is packed with restaurants, bars and tourists

I had already been to Telegraph Cove filming, so this time we went to Victoria. We went on two ‘whale-watching’ trips (orcas – despite their other name, killer whales – are actually classed as dolphins) and were amazed at the number of orcas we saw. These were residents, and can be regularly spotted between June and September. There are three resident pods around Victoria with about 80 orcas in each.

Wildlife presenter Strachan also visited the city Vancouver on the mainland and felt right at home with the hippy vibe of Tofino in British Columbia

Our next stop was Tofino and Ucluelet on the west coast. Our hotel at Ucluelet, the Black Rock Oceanfront Resort, was a stunning place right on the ocean. Tofino is a chilled little town with lots of organic cafes, surfers, trees and beaches, and from here you can go on whale-watching boats and bear-watching trips. 

We went kayaking and black bear-watching and both trips were brilliant. Tofino is the sort of place you could chill in for weeks, and if you get a pair of colourful baggy trousers, a few dreadlocks and drink lots of kale smoothies, you’d fit in perfectly. (I felt very comfortable with the hippy vibe, as I’ve never grown out of tie die since it was in fashion in the 1970s!)

The next part of our trip was undoubtedly the highlight – our four-day package to Knight Inlet. To get there we had to go by float plane, and it was hugely exciting getting on board. The trip made a memorable start to our adventure.

The flight is a stunning half hour over the Great Bear Rainforest, the largest piece of intact temperate forest left in the world.

Red cedar, western hemlock and sitka spruce, some of them 1,000 years old, reach high into the sky. Of course logging is a continuous threat, and we saw plenty of it as we flew over, but these days, it’s more controlled than it used to be, and much more sustainable.

As we arrived into Glendale Cove we could see the floating lodge that would be home for the next three nights. Knight Inlet used to be a fishing lodge but was bought in 1996 by the Wyatt family and is now run as a grizzly bear-watching paradise.

The area has one of the largest concentrations of grizzly bears in British Columbia, with 30 to 40 bears. The population changes regularly depending on the number of new cubs the bears produce. During spring and summer, the bears feed on the cove’s abundance of sedge grasses, berries and shellfish in the inter-tidal zone, and they are easy to spot.

Come August, the salmon run starts and the bears gorge on the abundance of rich protein, fattening themselves up ready for their winter hibernation.

When you arrive at Knight Inlet they tell you it’s ‘Bear Boot Camp’ – and they’re not kidding. The three days are packed with activities you can choose from, and the days go ridiculously quickly.

We went on several estuary tours to watch bears and bald eagles, an inlet cruise to the waterfalls, which included getting soaked by going through the spray of one (a highlight for Ollie), a walk through the forest to ‘above the clouds’, a kayak trip and a whole-day marine tour to spot orcas, seals, sea lions and humpback whales – and we saw plenty of them.

Knight Inlet is a remote, dramatic and wild place, with towering snow-capped granite cliffs, waterfalls, glaciers and an abundance of wildlife. I can’t fault it: the food, rooms, organisation, staff and activities, were all brilliant and I couldn’t help but fall in love with the place.

You can feel the stress lifting off your shoulders as the fresh air and beautiful wilderness works its healing powers and you reconnect with nature. It’s a place that pulls you back.

So now Knight Inlet is off the Bucket List, where next? Antarctica, the Amazon, polar bears in the Arctic, Baja California to see the blue whales, Kenya during the migration, diving on the Barrier Reef… the list goes on and hopefully I will slowly tick them off!
