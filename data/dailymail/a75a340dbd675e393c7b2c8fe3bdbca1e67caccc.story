A grandmother who lives in a make-shift caravan has asked her local council to move her to a permanent address so she can claim benefits in her old age.

Hannah Rose, 71, has demanded Ashford Borough Council in Kent find her disheveled trailer a place in a local campsite where she will be able to claim housing benefit.

The former French teacher would also like to see her pension raised by almost £100-a-week, despite having paid hardly any tax her entire life.

Hannah Rose, 71, has asked the council to recognise her make-shift caravan as a mobile home and provide it with a permanent address so she can claim benefits

The mother-of-three travelled for 17 years before returning to the UK in 1996 when she took up work  as a foreign language teacher with her second husband.

Following the breakdown of their marriage, Ms Rose lived on a travellers' site in Surrey before moving into the trailer that she shares with her two cats.

Now she wants council officials to find her a permanent spot on a campsite where she would be entitled to benefits that help cover the cost of site fees, but would not have to pay any council tax. 

The 71-year-old is being put up by the council in a £200-a-week B&B while they decide how to treat her case.

Despite only paying National Insurance for five years, the grandmother sees no reason why she shouldn't receive benefits from the Government. 

'I may not have contributed much financially but the French club I ran made a big difference,' she said.

The grandmother put the trailer together using donated wood and furnishings. She lives there with her two cats

'I think it's appalling the council doesn't have a list of static caravan sites to give someone who is trying to help themselves.

'The council cannot deal with people who are different.

'I would love to live in an eco community. I would like my freedom'

'I will be able to claim housing benefit from a static caravan, I desperately need an address.'

Ms Rose added she was 'grateful' to have been put up in the hotel while she 'sorts herself out'.

Supermarket bosses demanded she be moved after settling in a Sainsbury's car park in Ashford, Kent.

Council spokesman Mark James said the authority is deciding what 'level of duty' it has to the grandmother who is a member of political campaign group, Avaaz.

The mother-of-two, who is also a member of political campaign group Avaaz, feels she is entitled to receiving benefits as her own mother never received any and didn't even claim her pension

He said: 'We placed Hannah Rose in temporary accommodation on November 15 pending further investigations.

'She had an appointment booked in with our housing options team this week.

'We need to assess what level of duty we have to her and until we have had the opportunity to investigate her circumstances further we will not be able to comment.'
