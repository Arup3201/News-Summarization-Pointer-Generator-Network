Two 26 year-old women living on separate continents - one of them an actress in Los Angeles, the other a fashion designer in London - have spoken of the moment they came to discover each other as identical twins.

Anaïs Bordier and Samantha Futerman were separated at birth. Miss Bordier was taken to France by her adoptive parents, while Miss Futerman was raised in New Jersey.

Over the course of the last year, the pair have visited each other in their respective countries and taken the time to get to know each other before deciding to answer the question that they and everyone around them wanted to know - are they sisters?

My other half:  The two young women launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a documentary and meet each other in person. They've nearly reached their $80,000 goal

It all began last February. 'I got message on Facebook from a girl in London,' 
Miss Futerman, an actress, said in an interview on Good Morning America.

'It said she had seen me in a YouTube 
video, then after looking my name up online, saw that we were both 
adopted, and born on the same day, in the same city. When I saw her 
profile, it was crazy. She looked just like me.'

The message had been sent by Anais Bordier, a French fashion designer in London.

'When
 I looked at the video, I - it was, like, shocking ...,' Bordier said.

'You can't imagine that you might have a twin sister somewhere that you don't know about.'

Last
 February Miss Bordier, who is studying at Central St Martins in London 
but was raised as an only child in a Parisien suburb, had been watching a
 YouTube film when she noticed that an actress in the clip looked very 
similar to her.

She also 
shared similar mannerisms to the actress, who turned out to be Miss 
Futerman, who grew up in Verona, New Jersey and was living in Los 
Angeles.

History: The sisters say they always felt as though something was missing in their lives. They never knew that they were each placed in separate foster care agencies and adopted separately

Coincidence: They would soon discover they both have been adopted after being born on the same day in the same Korean city. Could it be? Were they identical twins separated at birth?

Growing up: Bordier grew up in France while Futerman spent her childhood in New Jersey

Twinterest: The two have now taken a DNA test that confirms that they are indeed related. Over the last year they have been filming to make a documentary together as they travel and learn about each 
other's lives

Is it really you? The first time the twins met each other, they had to touch each other just to be doubly sure

Miss Bordier 
contacted aspiring actress Miss Futerman on Twitter and the women say 
they soon worked out that they were both born in the South Korean town of Busan on November 19, 1987.

Bordier and Futerman, who appeared together for this morning's interview, decided to start chatting via Skype. Both women speak English, although French is Anais' first language.

Futerman
 described this morning looking into Bordier's face and seeing a mirror 
of her own features. Nonetheless, they've had their DNA tested to erase 
any doubt that they're sisters.

'It
 was weird, but I feel like there was a strange calm and comfort as 
well, and something that I can't really explain,' Futerman said. 'We 
talked for three hours.'

They met for the first time in London, then in Los Angeles, and now they've united again in Manhattan.

The pair have now taken a DNA test to clear up any doubt and the results proved what they knew deep inside: they were sisters.

My second heart: The twins feel as though everything is perfect now that they have found one another

Filmmakers:  They decided to make a documentary about their experience and say they've already heard from countless other adoptees thanking them

Emotions: The girls say they often felt as though something was missing in their lives but that they feel they have extra confidence knowing they found their second heart

Proof: The DNA result proved what their faces told them all along: they were sisters

The 'twinsters,' as they have since dubbed themselves, shared an immediate and undeniable bond.

Two
 women decided to share their emotional meeting with others and launched
 a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a documentary tracking their 
'possible siblingship' — which would culminate in the release of their 
DNA results, proving whether or not they are in fact related.

Over
 the last year, the twins have been able to capture tons of amazing 
moments along their journey, including two weeks at Samantha's home in 
California, and 10 days in their birthplace, Seoul, Korea, where they 
visited their adoption agency together.

All in all, the sisters have collected 42,000 video clips together.

Bordier says she felt as though something was missing in her life.

She
 said that her father had cried upon meeting Miss Futerman, while her 
mother believed that the pair were so alike that they had to be sisters.

They
 both share a love of Harry Potter, the arts, and many of the same 
television programmes, while Miss Bordier confessed that the duo had 
taken advantage of their physical similarities to play a trick on Miss 
Futerman's mother and father.

'I
 came out first and surprised them and they stopped for five seconds, 
saying, 'What? What? No!' and they said we were identical too. It was 
just like The Parent Trap.'

After she and her sister were born, they were each placed in separate foster care agencies and adopted separately.

So much to catch up on:  The time they first met online, they shared their entire life stories in that first conversation, chatting for three hours

Pure chance: The story is remarkable that they managed to find each other after 25 years, yet neither knew of the others' existence!

'I
 did feel like I missed something,' she said. 'I had an imaginary friend
 when I was a kid.  It happens to a lot of kids, but I had an imaginary 
friend and she was called Anne ...  I needed that comfort, I guess,'she 
added.

Futerman has two adoptive brothers, while Bordier is the only child in her family.

'It
 makes me really emotional, because as a kid you have dreams of wanting 
to change the world.  It's something-- it's something that feels too far
 away ... it's an overwhelming thing to know that two little,  tiny, 
Asian hobbits can,you know, make a difference,' she said, laughing.

The
 pair have decided to make a documentary about their experience, and 
they say they've already heard from many other adoptees who are thankful
 to them for sharing their experience.

They're still raising money to help with the post-production of the documentary and have almost reached their $80,000 goal.

For Christmas, Futerman got necklaces that say 'Best Friends Forever' for her and her sister. Bordier appreciates it.

'It sounds really cheesy, but I think we need those little kid's moments and those cheesy moments together,' Bordier said.

Futerman
 described finding her sister like 'that feeling on Christmas when you 
open up the presents, the one you were asking for, it's that - that pure
 feeling of joy - that's how I always feel.'
