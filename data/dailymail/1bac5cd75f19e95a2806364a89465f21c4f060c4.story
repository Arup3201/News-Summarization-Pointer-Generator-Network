The father of a teen stowaway who survived a five-hour flight from California to Hawaii after hiding in the wheel well of a Boeing 767 today said Allah saved the boy as he spoke out for the first time.

Abdilahi Yusuf Abdi, who lives in Santa Clara, California, said that he was shocked when Hawaiian authorities called him on Sunday to reveal they had found his son, whom he identified as Yahya Abdi.

The 15-year-old was found on the tarmac in Maui after climbing into a plane at a San Jose airport and then likely passing out when it took off - surviving low oxygen levels and freezing temperatures.

'When I watched the analysis about the extraordinary and dangerous trip of my son on local TVs and that Allah had saved him, I thanked God and I was very happy,' the relieved father told VOA.

Miraculous: The boy, identified by his father as Yahya Abd, is pictured after he was found on the tarmac in Maui on Sunday. He ran away in an attempt to reunite with his mother, who lives in Somalia

It was previously revealed that the teenager had left the home where he lived with his father and stepmother in a bid to escape to Somalia and reunite with his mother.

'He was always talking about going back 
to Africa, where his grandparents still live,' his father said, adding that the living conditions there did not make going back an option.

He added that his son did not receive a 
good education in Africa and has struggled while at school in the U.S. 
He said that these school problems appeared to be bothering him.

The father said his son is now recovering in a Hawaii hospital.

The teenager is ‘resting comfortably’ at a hospital in Hawaii, spokeswoman Kayla Rosenfeld of the state's Department of Human Services said in a statement.

The young Santa Clara resident is in 
the custody of the department's Child Welfare Services division, and 
officials were working to ensure his safe return to California, she 
said.

The teen's friends at Santa Clara High School were stunned to learn of his death-defying adventure.

‘He was kind of shy,’ Emanuael Golla told KGO-TV.
 ‘He really didn't speak that much. But we were all surprised about what
 happened. We didn't really think it was him, but we're happy to know 
that he's all right.’

The boy, who is originally from Somalia, enrolled in Santa Clara High only a few months ago.

On
 Tuesday, it emerged that the 15-year-old runaway allegedly spent up to 
six hours undetected at Mineta San Jose International Airport after 
scaling a fence at around 1am.

In San Jose, airport officials said they were reviewing how the boy 
slipped through security that includes video surveillance, German 
shepherds and Segway-riding police officers.

After taking off around 8am, the
 Hawaiian Airlines jet landed in Maui at 10.30am (local time) and he 
eventually stumbled out of his hiding place an hour later.  

Home: The teen lived with his father and stepmother at this Santa Clara home - but vanished on Friday

Breach: The boy scrambled over a fence at Mineta San Jose International Airport in the dark, crossed a tarmac and climbed into a jetliner's wheel well

It emerged that he actually left the 
house in Santa on Friday night, meaning he was missing for around 36 
hours by the time he was found on the tarmac at Maui airport, Hawaii.

Despite his lengthy absence, Santa Clara police have confirmed his family did not file a missing persons report.

According
 to Maui airport manager Marvin Moniz, the boy did not want to go home to his father.

'He
 told us that he wanted to go and live with his mother,' he said. 'He said he missed her.

'It
 was clear from talking to him that he was not happy and he did not want
 to return home. He did not get on with his stepmother and did not like 
living with her. He was a teenager who was upset and he was not ready to
 go back.'

Mr Moniz went on: 'He was very 
disorientated and weak. We gave him some teriyaki meatballs, rice and 
salad to give him some strength.

'He spoke perfect English and didn’t really have an accent, so I assume he had been in the US for a long time.

'He
 seemed OK physically. The only thing he complained about was that his 
ears hurt. He said all the noise and the vibrations had given him a 
really bad ringing in his ears.'

How he did it: It is believed the teen went into some sort of 'hibernation' to be able to survive the extreme conditions

The incredible story has been met with disbelief by all those who know the teenager and his family.

Neighbour Amy McGinn told KTVU:
 'They are very quiet, very private. When I heard there was an argument,
 that was surprising, because I never hear anything, like loud noises 
from the house.'

McGinn 
added that the boy's father drives a taxi, while the stepmother is 
mostly seen taking her five children to and from school.

It
 was not immediately clear how the boy stayed alive in the unpressurized
 space, where temperatures at cruising altitude can fall well below zero
 and the air is too thin for humans to stay conscious. An FAA study of 
stowaways found that some survive by going into a hibernation-like 
state.

The FAA says 105 stowaways have 
sneaked aboard 94 flights worldwide since 1947, and about one out of 
four survived. But agency studies say the actual numbers are probably 
higher, as some survivors may have escaped unnoticed, and bodies could 
fall into the ocean undetected.
