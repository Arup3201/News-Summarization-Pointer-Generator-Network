Surrey captain Graeme Smith could miss the rest of the season after suffering a fracture in his right knee.

The former South Africa skipper has returned to his homeland to undergo surgery, with long-time international colleague Hashim Amla moving to The Oval on a month-long stint to take his place in Surrey's batting line-up.

Smith, who made a century in Surrey's County Championship win over Gloucestershire last week, suffered an ankle injury last May that caused him to miss a large part of his first season with the team.

Big blow: Graeme Smith could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury

Going under the knife: South African star Smith has returned to his homeland for surgery

His latest blow means Surrey have named wicketkeeper Gary Wilson to lead the team in the short term.

Surrey announced on their website: 'Surrey CCC captain Graeme Smith has been diagnosed with a fracture in the tibial tuberosity of the right knee and will be returning to South Africa for surgery and may miss the remainder of the season.'

Filling the void: Hashim Amla has been brought to The Oval in Smith's absence

Amla, who had a short spell at Surrey towards the end of last season, is poised to face Essex in a four-day game starting on Sunday.

Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart said: 'Whilst it is obviously a huge blow for Graeme to be heading home, especially after his recent match-winning hundred, and with the impact he was having in the dressing room, we are very fortunate to be able to welcome back Hashim Amla for the next month.'

Stand-in captain Wilson said: 'It's a huge honour and a privilege to be asked to captain Surrey. I can guarantee everyone I'll be doing my best to fill the huge shoes left by Graeme's unfortunate injury.'
