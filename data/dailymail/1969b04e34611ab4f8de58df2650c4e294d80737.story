Â The characters of Star Wars may live in 'a galaxy far, far away', but these images show a rather more down-to-earth vision for the stars of the sci-fi series.

The atmospheric photographs show models dressed in masks to look like Han Solo's sidekick Chewbacca, a bear-like 'Wookiee' from the planet Kashyyyk.

They are the work of visionary artist Mako Miyamoto, who has created a series of images with the creatures in unlikely everyday situations.

Fight: Two Wookiees take each other on in this image, 'Stop Blocking My Fists With Your Face Pt I'

Threatening: The star of 'The Hitman' gives off a sinister air as he points a shotgun at the camera

Wookiees are shown drinking a bars, going rollerskating and exercising in the path.

The contrast between the normality of the models' activities and their otherworldly garb creates a surreal effect.

Mr Miyamoto, from Portland, Oregon, was inspired by his childhood love of comic books and monster tales, and wanted to bring a slice of science-fiction fantasy into the world we live in.

Traveller: A wookiee sets off down the railway tracks - but it's not as speedy as the Millennium Falcon

Poignant: The images are bizarre but, in some cases such as 'The Bridesmaid', strangely moving

The 32-year-old, an art director at a design firm, began the project two and a half years ago, and uses his friends as the masked models.

'Drawing was an obsession for me, and the weird, monster-infested world that comic artists created was my inspiration,' he said.

'Later on, I picked up a camera and found that I enjoyed capturing the world around me, and with it, I could bring some of the magic and mystery back into the world I love so much as a child.

Violent: Like the fictional characters, these Wookiees seem to possess immense power

Terror: The staring eyes of the mask make this photograph, 'Eeaaarrgh', a haunting image

'I usually start with an idea that I begin sketching out, storyboarding each frame from the shoot and figuring out lighting.

'Next, I start roughing out my shots, location scouting, and getting together wardrobe and props. Then on the day of the shoot, everything changes and half the shoot is improvised, which is all the fun.

'I have always been intrigued by masks. They hide the person behind, but also bring forth pieces of them that at first glance were shadowed by their expressions.'
