Are you afraid of the future? That's the gist of what a new Pew study out Thursday asked Americans.

And the answer looks like no. Though there are plenty of exceptions, Americans said they generally embrace the future of science and technology.

However, a majority of Americans have a negative view of many up-and-coming technologies like drones, cybernetic implants or worn technologies like Google Glass and DNA modification for humans.

Sorry Google Glass, the verdict is in and a majority of Americans find cyborg-like devices and implants too creepy

They may be a boon for the folks at Amazon but most Americans think drones are worrisome addition to our skies

Google is also out of luck with it's driverless car, says the recent Pew study, which found that 50 percent wouldn't even get inside

One example of where respondents to the Pew Research Center study was the driverless car.

Google wants us all to have our very own and laws are even springing up to help pave the way. But Pew found that 50 percent of Americans would not get inside one.

Also related to the tech giant was the finding that 53 percent think a future where people wear or implant technology that constantly feeds them information would be change for the worse. Sorry Google Glass!

Another internet company, Amazon, will be interested to hear Pew's finding that 63 percent of Americans say opening U.S. airspace to drones is a bad idea.

While scientists recently managed to grow a hamburger in vitro, a huge 80 percent of Americans say they would decline to eat it.

The Pew Research shows that Americans overall have a rosie view of technologies overall, but certain developments--even those we're on the cusp of making--have them worried

Seems unlikely: A surprising 39 percent of Americans think teleportation could happen in their lifetimes

And 66 percent feel that giving parents the ability to alter their baby's DNA to make them smarter, healthier or more athletic would be a dangerous thing.

Despite their trepidations, 59 percent of Americans think technological changes in general will have a positive effect on society.

Unlike food, we're comfortable with lab grown organs at least in as much as 80 percent of adults believe such things will be improving our lives within 50 years.

But plenty of potential advancements that have become sci-fi staples just don't seem likely as much as we'd like them to come to be.

A surprising 39 percent of adults think scientitists will have invented teleportation in 50 years. A healthy 56 percent have their doubts.

Sixty-four percent think long-term space colonies are too far fetched and back on earth, 77 percent doubt we'll be controlling the weather in 50 years.

Life outside of earth seems on the horizon for 33 percent of respondents

Most doubt we'll be zapping away hurricanes any time soon

Many Americans are deeply wary of many of the technologies we're at the cusp of reaching

Meanwhile, 6 in 10 Americans say future advancements will lead to a better life for people
