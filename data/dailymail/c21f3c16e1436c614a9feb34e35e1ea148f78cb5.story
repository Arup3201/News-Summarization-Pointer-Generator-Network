Just in time for the Super Bowl, one man has trained his rabbit to deliver beer.

The unidentified pet owner from Brooklyn, New York, uploaded a video to YouTube showing Wallace the bunny in action.

'Wallace, grab me a beer please,' the man commands before the critter puts his paws on the handle of a small cart and wheels it forward. 

The DIY cardboard trolley was apparently built specially for the occasion.

It takes Wallace less than half-a-minute to complete his delivery task.

'Thanks buddy,' his appreciative master says as he comes to a standstill with a single beverage in tow. 

Wallace apparently belongs to his trainer's girlfriend.

The YouTube channel, Wallace The Mad King, captures the animal up to various antics.

On the job: 'Wallace grab me a beer please,' the man commands before the critter puts his paws on the handle of a small cart and wheels it forward

One video shows him pulling a funny face while another clip shows him hanging out in a cardboard hutch shaped like a castle.

According to  description for his beer delivery video, Wallace has been practicing the stunt for over year.

In order to work the cart, he nibbles pellets of food located on the top of its handle with his teeth, wheeling it across the floor.

Many viewers have congratulated his skill and pondered building a similar contraption for their own furry friends.
