Three times as many children have tried e-cigarettes as have smoked tobacco, figures show.

They have prompted concern that e-cigs are acting as a ‘nicotine gateway’ for children luring them to back to more harmful cigarettes.

A study of 1,601 pupils aged 10 and 11 in Wales found that six per cent had tried e-cigs compared to just two per cent who had smoked tobacco.

Furthermore, those who had tried the devices were seven times more likely to admit they might take up smoking within the next two years.

Some 14 per cent of those who’d tried e-cigs said they might start compared to just two per cent of children who’d never tried.

The battery-operated devices resemble pens or cigarettes and they contain a liquid form of nicotine that give users the same rush as smoking.

They are used by an estimated one million Britons trying to give up smoking but concerns have also been raised that they are luring children on to tobacco.

The study was only carried out on Welsh pupils and Public Health England said its own similar survey had found just two per cent of children had tried them.

Nonetheless campaigners said the findings showed the need to keep a ‘watchful eye’ on their use.

Mark Drakeford, health minister for Wales said: ‘These latest findings shine further light on the potential impact of e-cigarettes on our children and young people.

‘I am concerned the use of e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to and re-normalise smoking, especially for a generation who have grown up in a largely smoke-free society.'

Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said: ‘This research is interesting in that it is the first survey of its kind in the UK to find the number of children who have tried e-cigarettes to be higher than the number who have tried smoking.

Experts have raised concerns that the devices are acting as 'nicotine gateways' luring children to smoke

‘This again emphasises that e-cigarettes are still an emerging and evolving technology, and that we need to keep a watchful eye on how they are being used, particularly by children.

Although there is no evidence that vaping (smoking an e-cig) is anywhere near as harmful as smoking, e-cigarettes are not recommended for children or non-smokers, at least until more research has been conducted into their long-term health impacts.

‘That said, these data on their own don’t provide clear evidence of the so-called ‘gateway effect’ of e-cigarette use leading to sustained smoking.

‘Research suggests that smoking rates amongst UK children overall, while still too high, have continued to decline since the emergence of e-cigarettes last decade.’
