Most Premier League footballers with time to spare during the international break would probably spend Friday night at one of London's exclusive bars... not taking in a show at the Royal Opera House.

This former England international tweeted a picture taken from the balcony seat of his salubrious surroundings, accompanied by the caption: 'Date night at the @RoyalOperaHouse.'

The curtains were about to be raised on Philip Glass' sell out show The Trial, based on a novel by Franz Kafka - which is unlikely to be on your average player's list of favourite books.

Which Premier League star tweeted this picture from the Royal Opera House while on a date with his wife?

The opera tells the story of Josef K, who wakes on the morning of his 30th birthday to find two men have come to arrest him. They do not say what for and over the next year he desperately tries to find out what he's been accused of, why he's been accused and if there is any way to escape his fate.

While you may be expecting the Premier League's culture vulture to come from a sophisticated part of the continent, you'll probably be surprised to hear it is actually West Ham winger Matt Jarvis.

The 28-year-old only recently played his first minutes of the season in last week's 2-0 defeat of QPR as he struggled to recover from a hip problem. 

And the Premier League's mystery opera lover is... none other than West Ham winger Matt Jarvis

Jarvis, pictured in pre-season,  has only played in one game  this season after being sidelined by a hip injury
