Campaigner: Catherine Hester talking to children at Millbank Primary School in Cardiff as head of Oxfam in Wales

While Stephen Hester has been lambasted over £1million bonus, his sister has devoted  her life to helping the needy and trying to bring about a fairer society.

Catherine Hester is the former head of Oxfam in Wales and played an active role in the Make Poverty History campaign.

The 43-year-old also spent two years as a volunteer in Tanzania, where she co-ordinated an education programme for street children.

Before that she worked with children with special needs and taught in a primary school in London’s East End.

In her time with Oxfam she was passionate about trying to raise living standards for the worst off.

She told a newspaper: ‘Make Poverty History is not about charity, it is about justice. It is about justice for the poorest people in the world. We need to keep the public pressure and public outrage going.’

A former colleague of Miss Hester’s at Oxfam, Katrina Gass, said: ‘She cared a lot. She was very dynamic and innovative. She was very interested in welfare of children but also interested in the environment.’

Oxfam has backed the campaign for a ‘Robin Hood tax’ which highlighted a massive earlier bonus handed to Mr Hester as part of its demand for higher contributions from the financial sector.

Miss Hester declined to comment about her brother’s latest bonus when the Daily Mail contacted her at her modest detached house in Reading, Berkshire, yesterday.

In the past Mr Hester has told how  his first job in a sweet factory  taught him the value of money and insisted that the life he now leads is a ‘long way from the world I grew up in.’

Fat cat: Stephen Hester has claimed humble beginnings, but he is in fact the child of high-flying academics

His parents were in fact high-flying academics who now live in a Grade II listed Georgian property worth an estimated £1.5million in a picturesque North Yorkshire village.

His father Ronald is professor of chemistry at York University and was previously a research fellow in Cambridge and an assistant professor at U.S. Ivy League university Cornell.

His mother, Dr Bridget Hester, is a psychotherapist.

Mr Hester owns a 350-acre country estate in Oxfordshire and a ski chalet in Verbier.
