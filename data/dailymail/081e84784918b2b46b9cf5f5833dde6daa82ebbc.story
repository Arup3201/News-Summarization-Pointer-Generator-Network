Will Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day be another to add to the list of classic London derbies? Time will tell.

There have been a few to recall involving Jose Mourinho, such as when he and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had handbags  at Stamford Bridge as recent as early October.

But can Chelsea brag that they are the kings of the London derby? Scroll down to find out which club are the champions of the capital.

Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham have all played 209 London derbies, though New Year's Day will see the Gunners fall a fixture behind as they travel to Southampton. Their top spot is safe, however, as they are six points ahead of Chelsea in the all-time table, having won 110 of their 209 derbies. 

Mourinho's club have won 107 of their 209 but can make that 108 on Thursday in north London, where an old rivalry could be reignited between Federico Fazio and Diego Costa.

The Tottenham centre back, while with Sevilla, got into a scuffle with Costa while the striker was at Atletico Madrid, resulting in the defender punching the man he was marking in the stomach.

Still, if history is anything to go by, Chelsea should beat their London rivals. Tottenham are some way behind in third in the all-time table on 263 points, having won just 66 of their 209 derbies.

Down at the bottom, though, it's not good news for Crystal Palace or Queens Park Rangers. They have 52 and 70 points, respectively, though they have played far less London derbies than the rest.

In the 2014 table, though, Chelsea come out on top with 25 points. They won eight of their 10 derbies during the calendar year - twice as many as Tottenham managed, who have 14 points.

Sandwiched in between is Arsenal who, having won seven of their 10, come out with 22 points.

The goal difference is perhaps the most telling. In 2014, Chelsea scored 24 goals and conceded just four in their derbies. Tottenham, on the other hand, scored just 11 and let in 12.
