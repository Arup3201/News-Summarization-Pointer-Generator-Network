A former Oxford University student could be named as America’s first woman Defence Secretary.

Michele Flournoy, 52, is on the shortlist to lead the Pentagon in President Obama’s second term, it emerged last night.

The Harvard University graduate went on to study at Oxford before heading to Washington.

Political expertise: Michele Flournoy has years of experience in the defense field

She holds a Master of Letters postgraduate degree from Oxford, where she was a Newton-Tatum scholar at Balliol College.

She has spent two decades climbing to 
the top of the notoriously male-dominated US national security 
establishment, winning the admiration of politicians and military 
chiefs.

After working in the Pentagon under 
Bill Clinton, Mrs Flournoy returned in the department’s No 3 position — 
undersecretary of defence for policy — when Mr Obama began his first 
term in 2009.

She resigned last February, saying she wanted to spend more time with her three children.

But now she is being heavily tipped to return, this time in the top spot.

‘She’d be a terrific appointment. 
She’s incredibly competent, smart and really loved by everyone who works
for her,’ said James Mann, who wrote a book on the President’s foreign 
policy advisers called The Obamians.

Outgoing Defense chief: Leon Panetta is expected to announce his retirement soon

The next Defence Secretary will take 
over as budget cuts and the waning war in Afghanistan fuel  questions 
about the future of the armed forces.

Others on the shortlist to run the 
notoriously male-dominated Pentagon include Deputy Defense Secretary Ash
Carter and former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel.

Hagel was considered a favourite for 
the post, and the President backed him in a recent interview, but the 
Republican has come under fire for his past criticism of Israel, early 
opposition to some sanctions against Iran, and alleged homophobia.

Ashton
Carter, 58, is also in the running, and is said to covet the job, but 
insiders say he is not considered part of the President's inner circle.

White House watchers suggested that 
President Obama, who is currently on holiday in Hawaii, might announce 
the new Defense post as early as next week.

In
1996, Mrs Flournoy was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for 
Outstanding Public Service, the Department of Defense Medal for 
Distinguished Public Service in 1998 and the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff's Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 2000.

Other contenders for the top job at the Pentagon include Ashton Carter, left, and Chuck Hagel, right

In 2007 Flournoy co-founded the Center for a New American Security defense think-tank.

After
Obama was elected President in 2008, she was chosen as one of the 
Department of Defense Review Team Leads for the Obama Transition and in 
2009 she was made Under Secretary of Defense for Policy - the 
department's third in command - serving under Robert Gates.

In
February 2011 Flournoy resigned saying she wanted to spend more time 
with her teenage children at their home in Bethesda, Maryland.

Since then, she has worked as a consultant in the private sector.

Mulling over key jobs: President Obama is considering who to appoint to Cabinet posts

Officials say that all three candidates 
are still in the running, and Obama has not indicated strongly towards 
any one particular candidate.

The LA Times quoted Flournoy saying in a recent interview that her time away from the Pentagon meant she had 'had a chance to recharge my batteries, and I am eager for public service in the future'.

But she added: 'It would be very hard to miss these very precious years … the last years with my teenagers at home.'
