Were they government propaganda or works of art?

The 1930s saw an explosion of documentary photo and film work depicting impoverished Americans around the country, including poor African American day laborers in the Deep South.

Many of these vivid images were captured by Farm Security Administration photographers - snappers hired by the government to 'put out positive propaganda' about President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 'New Deal' to generate public support.

Roosevelt's bold package of reforms to lift America's economy out of the Great Depression made the government, for the first time, responsive to the needs of its suffering population.

FSA photographers, such as Marion Post Wolcott whose vivid images are below, documented the poverty and deprivation in pockets of the U.S. to show why the New Deal was needed.

'As
 an FSA documentary photographer, I was committed to changing the 
attitudes of people by familiarizing America with the plight of the 
underprivileged, especially in rural America,' she said, according to a University of Virginia biographical sketch.

'FSA
 photographs shocked and aroused public opinion to increase support for 
the New Deal policies and projects, and played an important part in the 
social revolution of the 30s.'

Wolcott's moving images of the Deep South captured the 
enduring legacy of slavery - the extreme poverty, the continued work on plantations and  malnourishment. 

According to the University of Virginia, the task of Wolcott and her colleagues was to 'record both the need for and success of' New Deal farming and social security programs around the country.

The small team of photographers earned less than $3,000 a year, but managed to produce 270,000 pictures between 1935 and 1943 at a cost of $1 million.

'[The] cadre of photographers hardly worked inside a cultural vacuum,' a University of Virginia historian wrote.

'Could the FSA photographs, allegedly unadulterated and objectively snapped, be art, or, rather, did they represent purely propagandistic material?

'The answer encompasses both views.'

The
 Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division has preserved the 
original photographs, but have made them available on photosharing 
website Flickr since 2008.

The
 vivid collection of shots has attracted more than 10 million views, 
enabling viewers to tag and comment on pictures - what the library calls
 'history detective' work.
