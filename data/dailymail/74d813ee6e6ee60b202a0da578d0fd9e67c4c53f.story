When Margaret Pabst Battin's husband Brooke Hopkins broke his neck in a cycling accident and became almost completely paralyzed, she had to face her ideas about a person's right to die in a devastatingly personal way.

As an international leader in the euthanasia movement, the Professor of philosophy and bioethics at the University of Utah has written 'wheelbarrows full' about the right to death for terminally 
ill and seriously injured people.

Battin's husband, Brooke Hopkins, was 66 at the time of his accident
in 2008. He was cycling down a hill in City Creek Canyon in Utah when 
he collided with another bicycle and somersaulted in the air, severing 
his spinal cord when he landed on his neck.

A question of life or death: Brooke Hopkins is prepped for surgery in 2010 as Peggy Battin and son Mike look on

Expert: An authority on the ethics surrounding death, Battin is now facing her own husband's choice to die

One year earlier, he 
had updated his living will to include the clause that should he suffer 
an illness or injury that left him in a vegetative state, he didn't want
any treatment that 'would serve only to unnaturally prolong the moment 
of my death and to unnaturally postpone or prolong the dying process.'

But
emergency services didn't know about this will, and Brooke Hopkins was 
kept alive until he reached the hospital where he was placed on a 
ventilator, thus saving his life and creating for himself and his wife 
the ultimate quandary: life or death.

Battin, 72, who is known as Peggy, traces her interest in assisted suicide, euthanasia and the right to a dignified death back to her mother's painful and difficult death of liver cancer when Battin was 21.

'A person should be accorded the right to live his or her life as they see fit (provided, of course, that this does not significantly harm others), and that includes the very end of their life,' she has written in one of her nearly 40 journal articles on this subject.

The terrible injury of her husband of 30 years hasn't changed Battin's core belief in self-determination, but it's revealed complexities in the issue she wasn't prepared for, not least her own unwillingness to let go of her beloved husband and his reluctance to leave her when he knows she doesn't want him to.

Beloved: Brooke Hopkins has continued to teach, read and write prodigiously after his devastating accident

There's also decoding what Hopkins really does want.

Before his accident, Hopkins was a gregarious, fit, adventurous outdoorsman with a passion for the English romantic poets. He has a doctorate from Harvard and worked at the University of Utah as an English professor.

'At parties he was the one who ate the most, drank the most, talked the loudest, danced the longest,' a friend told The New York Times.

Now, Hopkins has good days and bad days. One bad day in 2012 resulted in the drafting of his 'Final Letter' when his pain became unbearable.

'Pain eats away at your soul,' The New York Times reports he wrote on July 28, 2012, using his voice-recognition software to dictate the letter to his loved ones.

'For many years since the accident I have been motivated by a deep will to live and to contribute to the benefit of others in my small way. I think I have done that. And I am proud of it. But as I have told Peggy over the past few months, I knew that I would reach a limit to what I could do. And I have arrived at the limit over the past couple of weeks.'

Advocate: Two of the books Margaret 'Peggy' Battin has written on the subject of assisted suicide

For Peggy Battin, helping her husband
to hasten his death when there's a chance that he might have changed his mind later is a fear that often overrides what 
Hopkins tells her at any given moment. Making a decision that cannot 
be undone must be weighed with her own intuition of what Hopkins may 
feel in the future.

Death and dying: Peggy Battin has had to face the realities of her scholarly explorations since her husband's accident

Battin
told The New York Times that there have been times she's taken Hopkins 
to the hospital when he became ill and he later told her she did the 
right thing, despite indicating on other occasions he wants no medical 
intervention.

She doesn't 
believe her husband has yet made the decision to die, but rather his 
occasional desire to end it all is dependent on pain he might be 
feeling, or influenced by medications he's taking.

In
2012, following his Final Letter, Hopkins became seriously ill with 
pleural effusion, or liquid in the chest cavity, and had trouble 
breathing. Despite his indication prior that he was ready to die, Battin
rushed him to the ER.

Battin told The New York Times that she'd discussed with her husband the kind of death he wanted, and this delirious, uncomfortable state was not how he wished to go.

New pain management medications were administered, and now Hopkins says he thinks of his hospitalization with pleural effusion as having a 'happy ending.'

On good days, Hopkins can do the things that give his life meaning: teaching, writing, reading and interacting with his loved ones.

His living will states that he was not to be assisted with sustenance and hydration, but Hopkins can no longer eat and is fed through a tube, and the once-active professor is trapped in his wheelchair, with an army of helpers to attend to his physical needs.

Battin still believes in people's right to choose when and how we die, but her experiences with her husband have shown her is that each individual case is rife with diverse and conflicting issues.

'What has changed,' she told The New York Times, 'is my sense of how extremely complex, how extremely textured, any particular case is.'

According to The Salt Lake Tribune, Hopkins and Battin are writing a book about their experiences in the wake of Brooke Hopkins' accident.

Peggy Battin has continued to advocate for people who want to die and for legislation for doctors to be able to 'hasten death' in the terminally ill (for which there is provision in Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont so far).

Brooke Hopkins, now 71, has again expressed a wish to die, according to The New York Times. He has planned his death for the spring of 2014, when he will be finished teaching his latest course, on Don Quixote. Only time will tell whether he, and his wife Peggy, will make that choice.

Peggy Battin and Brooke Hopkins wrote in their last blog entry to date:

'This story doesn’t end, and it
doesn’t need to be a tragedy. It’s
still a story of love, even if it’s love under trial. It doesn’t end as long as we’re here to
write it, and it isn’t a tragedy if we can keep from letting ourselves think
so.  But we’re also aware of the
knife-edge we walk all the time, when the story could end not because we didn’t
have anything more to say, but because we weren’t here anymore to say it.'
