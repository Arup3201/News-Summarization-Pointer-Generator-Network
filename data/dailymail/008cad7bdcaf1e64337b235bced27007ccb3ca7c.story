From a glittering pair of golden earrings dating from the 14th century to an elaborate clutch bag decorated with silver scrollwork, the medieval rulers of Iraq were clearly a stylish bunch.

Now a rare collection of pieces created for and by Iraq's Il-Khanid dynasty has gone on display at the Courtauld Gallery for the first time.

But it's not all fashion and jewels. Other highlights include an incredible brass ewer, created for the royals in the northern city of Mosul, and a delicate porcelain decanter inscribed with flowing arabesque patterns.

Incredible: A silver and brass bag made for a high ranking woman in Mosul, northern Iraq, circa 1300-1330

Although inextricably linked with the history and culture of Iraq, the roots of the Il-Khanid dynasty lay elsewhere - in what is now modern Mongolia.

In the early 13th century, the Mongol 
leader Genghis Khan initiated a wave of invasions across Asia, and in 1256,
 his grandson Hülegü established a subsidiary dynasty, the Il-Khanids, 
to rule the south-western territories of the Mongols.

By the mid-1300s, Iraq was in their sights and in 1258 they captured
 Baghdad, the seat of the Caliphate, and in 1262, the city of Mosul. 

The
 Il-Khanids were enthusiastic patrons of art and architecture and their 
cosmopolitan court was furnished with 
luxury objects from around the world, including porcelains and lacquer from China,
 silverwares and silks from Central Asia, enamelled glass from Syria.

Mosul
 was the great trading city of northern Iraq.  It was ethnically and 
culturally diverse with Arabs, Iranians, Kurds, Turks, Christians, Jews 
and Muslims, all represented in the city, where various luxuries, 
including silks and muslins, and inlaid brass, were manufactured.

As a result, the city was famous for the quality of its metalwork, with Andalusian traveller Ibn Sacid, who 
visited Mosul in 1250, noting: 'There are many crafts in the city, 
especially inlaid brass vessels which are exported to rulers.'

And while the 
Mongol conquest of the city may have caused temporary mayhem, even for 
craftsmen, it also introduced a rich new source of patronage: the 
Il-Khanid court.

Under the rule of the Il-Khanids, art and culture flourished, with the royal court commissioning a series of spectacular items, some of which appear in the exhibition.

Craftsmanship: A beautiful engraved incense burner dedicated to Sultan Abu Sa'id made in Mosul circa 1319

Striking: A scene showing a Chinese princess and her Syrian lover from the Khamsa of Kwaju Kirmani, 1396

Among them are two sections of a celebrated copy of the 
Qur’an made for the ruler Öljeitü in 1310 and a delicate spherical incense burner created for Öljeitü’s son and successor, Abu 
Sacid.

Another Mosul-made piece is the spectacular silver bag, bequeathed to the Courtauld by Victorian collector Thomas Gambier Parry in 1858, and thought to have belonged to a high ranking woman at the Il-Khanid court.

Engraved with delicate scrollwork inside and out, 14th century illustrations of the court, pasted into an album in the late 18th century by a German bibliophile, Heinrich Friedrich von Diez, reveal that similar bags were commonly used by courtiers.

Other pieces include the 1232 Blacas Ewer, on loan from the British Museum and a recently conserved penbox that appears courtesy of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.

Court and Craft: A Masterpiece from Northern Iraq runs until the 18th May at The Courtauld Gallery. Tickets cost £6 for adults, concessions, £5. See courtauld.ac.uk for more information.
