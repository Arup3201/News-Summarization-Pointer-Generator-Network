Authorities are investigating claims that an aspiring meteorologist shot himself dead in front of friends.

Timothy Englehardt, 22, an honor student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head as he hung out with friends in Holly Hill, Florida on September 13.

In a frantic 911 call, a female caller claims: 'My friend shot himself.'

But police have said they have uncovered inconsistencies that makes them question that claim and have deemed the death suspicious, ABC News reported.

Big dreams: Tim Englehardt, 22, was close to getting his dream job as a meteorologist when he suffered a single gunshot wound to the head on September 13. Police are investigating his death as suspicious

Englehardt's father William told the Eagle Tribune that at least two couples were in the home at the time of the shooting.

At 6.14pm, his son texted a friend telling him to put away chicken that had been left out for a cookout - and just a minute later, at 6.15pm, police received a 911 call about a shooting.

On the call, in the background, someone can be heard apparently saying: 'I did it.'

The caller then tells that person: 'No, you didn't. Relax. You didn't kill him.'

When police arrived on the scene, they found the gun inside the house, rather than out on the porch where he had reportedly shot himself, Holly Hill Police Chief Steven Aldrich said.

Loss: He was an honor student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida

On the rise: Englehardt, pictured right, had completed an internship with WCVB in Boston over the summer

Loved: Englehardt, pictured with a friend, was also the president of his fraternity, Sigma Chi

Police have not named any suspects in the case. The 911 caller told ABC News that she is devastated but cannot comment until the investigation is over.

The questions come as Englehardt's parents, Bill and Therese, say they doubt their son would ever take his life - because he had so much to live for.

The top student had enjoyed a summer internship with WCVB in Boston, where he had presented the forecast, and was close to reaching his dream job back home near Boston next year, they said.

He had been accepted into Sigma Chi in his freshman year and was named later president of the fraternity. 

His parents added that he had been himself in the days leading up to the shooting and had called his grandmother to buy him a plane ticket home for Thanksgiving. 

Scene: He was on the porch of this home in September when he was shot. The 911 caller told dispatchers that he had shot himself dead - but could also be heard talking to someone else who said: 'I did it'

Doubts: His parents, William and Therese, say he had everything to live for and wouldn't have taken his life

He did not own a gun, his father said.

'I don't know why people thought it was a suicide,' his father told CBS Boston. 'Tim had everything in the world going for him. He never ever would have committed suicide, it wasn't in his nature.'

He told the Eagle Tribune that a police officer had visited their Haverhill, Masachusetts home to break the news to them.

'The detective I spoke to told me there was something about the way Tim died that did not sit well with him,' he said. 'I told him I would wait for the investigation to be completed and he told me he will get to the bottom of this.'
