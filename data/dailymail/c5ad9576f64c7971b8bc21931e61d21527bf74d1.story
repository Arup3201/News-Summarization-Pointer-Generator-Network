A veterinary student was killed in a murder-suicide just two months before graduation and days before she was expected to attend job interviews.

Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday.

The body of the University of California student was discovered after police staged a seven-hour stand-off outside the duplex, believing there was an armed gunman inside.

Veterinary student Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday following a murder-suicide 

Police received a mysterious 911 call from a man saying two people had been shot to death inside. 

According to the Sacramento Bee they initially thought it was a hoax, so only entered the building at 1:30am when they threw tear gas through the window.

Authorities have not publicly revealed who pulled the trigger, but Whitney's parents told the California paper officials said her daughter was the victim.

She and Hein were said to be in a platonic relationship and in a short-term rental agreement - creating mystery around what prompted the tragic events to unfold.

After father, Dennis Engler, told the Bee she moved in with Hein in December because the house she had lived in was too crowded. He said the deal was that she would cook in exchange for five months free rent. 

Whitney's family have said she and Hein (left) had a platonic relationship. He uploaded a picture to Facebook of a card (left) which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________' last year

He also posted images of a black semi-automatic rifle to the social media account 

He posted a number of pictures of a semi-automatic rifle on his Facebook last year as well as an image of a card which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________.'

It had a Cards Against Humanity branding at the bottom, referring to the popular card game. The space is supposed to be filled by a word. 

Mr Engler said: It’s mystifying. Nothing I’ve learned leads to even a hint of an explanation, which might never be forthcoming.

Whitney was a lover of animals and had been looking after a service dog called Rosie at the time. It has since been found after her friends set up a search in the area.  

Friend and fellow veterinary student Anjolie Anjali Daryani, who led the search for Whitney's pets, said on Facebook on Saturday: 'Last night I lost a good friend, and the world loss an amazing person. 

Friend Anjolie Anjali Daryani said Whitney was only two months away from graduating and had a number of job interviews planned this weekend 

'Whitney Engler I hope that you rest in peace and know that we are all doing everything we can to find Rosie. 

'I will never forget all of our time spent together.. whether it was horseriding, training our dogs, going out to dinners, going shopping, or just hanging out I will miss those moments dearly.'

She told Fox 40: 'She had job interviews set up this weekend, she’s less than 2 months away from graduation.' 

On Saturday night, a vigil was held by Whitney's friends on campus. More than 200 people gathered on the patio of Gladys Valley Hall.
