Kevin Pietersen remains as far away as ever from a return to England colours after it emerged on Friday that Surrey are no nearer an agreement to re-sign the maverick star.

Sportsmail can reveal that Pietersen has told Surrey, who released him at the end of last summer, that he will not play all county cricket for them next season — even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves.

He appeared to call Pietersen’s bluff by saying the 34-year-old would be considered for an England recall if he threw his lot in with a county and stated his case by scoring heavily in domestic cricket.

Yet it seems unlikely the county will be Surrey, who have not been able to reach agreement with Pietersen over a deal to play in red-ball cricket as well as the white-ball game.

The fact Pietersen struggled to attract a contract in this year’s Indian Premier League, before Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him in a cut-price deal, seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket.

But unless Pietersen is prepared to move away from London — something he previously stated he would not do — it seems that his options are diminishing. Leicestershire may take on Pietersen but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division.

Somerset, coached by Pietersen’s friend Matt Maynard, remain an option but the odds are against him being given a platform to stake a claim for England.

Graves, who does not succeed Giles Clarke as chairman until May 15, appeared to go against the wishes of senior figures in the England set-up when he seemed to endorse a Pietersen recall.
