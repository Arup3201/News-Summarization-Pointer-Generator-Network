One high school senior got his dream come true of nabbing a professional Houston Texans football cheerleader as his prom date all by using his twitter account.

17-year-old Michael Ramirez is a backup offensive lineman on the football team at Crosby High School in Texas and is also quite the social media Casanova.

The self-proclaimed comedian jokingly tweeted at 20-year-old Texans cheerleader Caitlyn and asked her if she would go to prom with him if he got 10,000 re-tweets on twitter. She said yes and miraculously his social media experiment worked.

Ramirez decided to ask the cheerleader to be his date after he noticed that Texans cheerleaders Lesha and Caitlyn suddenly started following him on Twitter, reports Ultimate Texans.

'You know what? I’m going to ask (Caitlyn) to prom,' Ramirez told his friend after his twitter discovery.

'She’s cute. We’ll just see what happens.'

Ramirez is newly single so he couldn't think of any other girl he wanted to take to his prom in May.

After being asked to prom, Caitlyn responded 'Of course I will,' with a smiley face.

After getting the OK, Ramirez tweeted '10,000 Re-tweets and I’ll be taking a Texans cheerleader to prom. … RETWEET RETWEET RETWEET.'

Not only did Ramirez obtain his 10,000 re-tweets, he did it all in under 24 hours.

By 4:30 p.m. the next day he had 10,592 re-tweets and 857 favorites. Caitlyn caught wind of his twitter success and wrote 'can't wait for prom' at about 2 pm the next day.

Mike became an instant twitter celebrity and hundreds of his fans have congratulated him on the site

Ramirez, who says he isn't Mr.popular, has become a twitter celebrity with many of his fans tweeting their congratulations.

According to the Crosby high school coach Jeff Riordan, Ramirez isn't the best player on the team but he has a 'special personality' and obviously has some off the field game.

With the help from his mother Monica Cortez, Mike has been planning an extra special prom date and his mother says they wont be taking her car.

Caitlyn assured Mike in an interview with KHOU11 that she has 'no expectations' and that the prom is really Mike's special evening.

Mike can learn a few things about his date on her Texans cheerleader page on which she says she enjoys sushi, dubstep, and the movie 'Anchorman'. Caitlyn's favorite animal is a cat and if she were given $100,000m, she'd buy and Audi R8.

In a few years Caitlyn hopes to be a sports broadcaster. In the meantime, she making one boy's dream come true.
