Suspect: Police believe Michael Sheer, 21, shot dead his parents Mark and Lydia Sheer and sister Amy Sheer, 15, before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide

A 21-year-old man is believed to have shot dead his parents and teen sister in a bloody memorial day murder-suicide, but the motive for the attack remains a mystery.

Michael Sheer killed his parents Mark and Lydia Sheer, 55 and 54, as well as his 15-year-old sister Amy Sheer, according to a statement from the Orange County Sheriff's Department.

They apparently died early Monday at their home in Mission Viejo, authorities said.

Deputies went to the upscale neighborhood around 3am after receiving reports that a man was yelling and shots might have been fired but couldn't confirm the reports after patrolling for several minutes, the Sheriff's Department said.

A relative found the bodies on Tuesday, more than 24 hours later.

Michael Sheer had attended Saddleback Valley Christian High School in San Juan Capistrano and played football as a freshman in 2007, the Orange County Register reported.

He also loved bodybuilding, neighbor LJ Otto said.

The Sheers were a 'good Christian family' who homeschooled their children for elementary school, Otto said earlier this week. Amy Sheer had just started as a freshman this year at Crean Luteran High School in Irvine.

The school has planned a chapel service to pray for the family.

Victims: Michael's father Mark Sheer was a business coach while his mother Lydia was a stay-at-home mom

Scene of the crime: The four bodies belonging to the Sheer family were discovered at their upscale Orange County home on Tuesday, but investigators believe the shooting actually happened on Monday

Mark Sheer worked as a 'tactical business coach' offering seminars for financial professionals, according to his website.  He also taught Bible study with his wife at a Lutheran church. Lydia was a stay-at-home mom.

'The mom was a homemaker, always making cookies,' Otto recalled. 'She was so cute. I came over here for Valentine's Day and she still had her Christmas trees up and she said, "it's Christmas all year round. We love to celebrate."'

'It was just one of those all-American families. This is a complete shock to me, a complete shock,' Otto said.

The Sheer's church, Mount of Olives, is offering grief counselors to parishioners.

'We are all devastated to learn about this tragedy. The Sheers were part of our family here at Mount of Olives [Lutheran Church],' senior pastor John Steward told the Los Angeles Times 'and we ask everyone to pray for their extended family and friends.

'Our primary concern is the welfare of our congregation, and particularly our teens and young adults who knew the Sheer children,' Steward added.

Sheriff's officials said there was no history of previous calls to the home. The newspaper said Michael Sheer's only criminal record involved three speeding tickets since 2009.

'They were literally the nicest family I ever met in my life,' 21-year-old Kendra Leach, who knew the family through Mount of Olives Lutheran Church, told the Register.

A neighbor, who refused to give her name, told the Times that the residents of the home were a 'perfect Christian family.'

She said her daughter was close friends with one of the family's children.

One neighbor told the Register that she thought she hear a young girl crying inside the home early Tuesday morning.

'It was just awful crying,' neighbor Anila Whitney-Miller said.

'That kind of screaming was so hard. Then it just stopped.'

Police have not revealed a motive for the crime
