Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today sent a ritual offering to a controversial shrine in a move likely to impact on his plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

A group of other Japanese lawmakers were also seen paying their respects at the Yakukuni Shrine - condemned by China and Korea as honouring Japan's militarist past - to mark the start of the country's autumn festival.

There was no sign of cabinet ministers there, although local media said Health Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki also sent an offering. A ruling party lawmaker tweeted that three ministers planned to visit the shrine tomorrow.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has risked angering China by sending an offering to Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which they have demanded the leader not visit in person

Expectations have been growing in Japan that Abe, who outraged Beijing and Seoul by visiting Yasukuni in person in December 2013, will be able to meet Xi for talks next month at an Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in Beijing.

Signs of improving relations have been growing as both sides recognise the impact their fallout has on business and the risk it could escalate militarily.  

Prospects for a leaders' chat are clouded by China's demands that Abe not visit the shrine - where Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal are honoured along with millions of war dead. Abe today sent an offering of a small masakaki tree.

A promise not to visit Yasukuni again would be difficult for Abe, whose conservative agenda includes recasting Japan's wartime history in a less apologetic tone.

Abe has previously said he visited the shrine not to glorify war, but to honour those who fought and died for their country. 

Abe it thought to be unlikley to visit the shrine ahead of the Asia-Pacific leaders summet in November where he hopes to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to improve relations between the two countries

But since visiting in December last year, he has stayed away, and instead sent an offering on key dates, in an effort to improve relations with China.  

Koichi Hagiuda, a ruling Liberal Democratic Party aide to Abe, said the prime minister was likely to refrain from visiting the shrine ahead of the November gathering in Beijing because it was in Japan's national interests.  

China also wants Japan to acknowledge the existence of a formal territorial dispute over tiny islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but also claimed by Beijing.

Japanese diplomatic experts ruled out such a move but said it was possible the two sides could find a diplomatic formula to 'agree to disagree' over the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China.

A slowing Chinese economy and a sharp drop in Japanese investment are key factors prompting Beijing to rethink its relations with Tokyo, experts said. Japanese firms' investment in China fell 40 per cent on an annual basis in the first half of 2014 after sliding by nearly one-fifth last year.

Reduced tensions would also benefit Japanese companies doing business in China.

A meeting with Xi would be a diplomatic coup for Abe who has travelled to around 50 countries since taking office, but has so far been unable to meet Chinese or South Korean leaders.

Abe has also signalled that he wants to meet South Korean President Park Geun-hye at November's leaders summit.

Persistent disputes over the legacy of Japan's 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean peninsula have cast doubts on the likelihood of such a meeting.

China-Japan relations have been strained since the 1937 Nanking Massacre and what China sees as Japan's refusal to acknowledge the extent of what happened there.

Japanese soldiers murdered tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of Chinese soldiers and civilians during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and were accused of raping local women and widespread looting.

Estimates of the death-toll range from 40,000 to 300,000, but revisionists in Japan have contended it is much lower, and even that the event was entirely fabricated. 

China sees the denial to acknowledge the extent of the massacre and Japan's reluctant to apologise as insensitive.
