Waves could soon break in the heart of Melbourne's CBD if a proposal for a man-made floating beach gets the tick of approval. 

The proposed Docklands Surf Park would produce one to 1.5 metre barrels in Victoria Harbour, complete with a sandy beach  and a 160 metre floatable wave pool with filtered salt water.

The project's designers, who expect the facility to cost more than $8 million, say the waves would be surf-able and are currently looking at technologies to adjust the size of the artificial swell to cater for beginners and seasoned pros.

Docklands Surf Park is a joint venture between engineering firm Arup and Melbourne-based architect Damian Rogers.

'The whole idea began with the idea of being able to surf in an inner city location. Melbourne has a lot of water surrounding it - we've got the bay and now the Docklands,' Mr Rogers said. 

'For us, it's the opportunity to finish work, come down here with your surfboard and have a surf.'

The proposal is in its early stages and would still need to get approval from Melbourne City Council, with the engineer company currently looking for funding opportunities other than the government.

'To surf in Melbourne normally requires you to drive down to Bells Beach an hour and a half away,' Urban and Transport Planner at Arup, Phil Carter, said. 

'While that's an iconic and amazing space... the convenience of surfing in the docklands is something that we thought was really interesting. 

'Going to work, carrying your surfboard down to the Docklands and having a surf - that's a real opportunity.' 

Surfing Victoria has already backed the plan as a potential hotspot for professional surfing competitions.

Max Wells, chief executive of Surfing Victoria, says he's been told of various plans for wave pools for the past decade, but Docklands Surf Park is the first he thinks that it could work.

'They've got the right location and the indication that it will be available to them,' he told The Age. 

'The fact it's 100 metres from a tram line and from Spencer Street [train] station is pretty amazing.

'I can imagine having surfers in suits heading for an after-work session and kids coming to Docklands carrying surfboards on Melbourne's trains and trams.'
