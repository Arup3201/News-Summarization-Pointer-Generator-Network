Pennsylvania authorities have broken up a drug ring they say was run by two prep school graduates.

They say it supplied marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy to students at three colleges and high schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs.

Montgomery County prosecutors identified the leaders of the operation as 25-year-old Neil Scott and 18-year-old Timothy Brooks.

Both graduated from The Haverford School, a $35,000-a-year prep school.

They were arraigned Monday on drug charges and related counts.

Scott's lawyer declined to comment.

Brooks' attorney, Greg Pagano, says Brooks 'regrettably lost his way' and is remorseful.

Prosecutors say the pair hired students to peddle the drugs at Lafayette, Gettysburg and Haverford colleges, and at several suburban high schools.

The two named their network 'The Main Line Takeover Project,' investigators said.

'Their intention, as the name suggests, was the two of them would take over drug distribution - in particular, marijuana distribution - in schools and colleges on the Main Line,' District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman said.

'This was not a game. These people were in business, they were in business to make money and they were going to do whatever they needed to do so that no one threatened their business,' she said.

Wanted: Timothy Brooks is led into Montgomery County Magisterial District Court. Prosecutors identified Brooks as one of the leaders of a drug ring they say supplied marijuana and cocaine to colleges and schools

Partner in crime: Neil K. Scott covers his face as he is led into court. He was one of the leaders of a drug ring. Scott and the other suspect, Timothy Brooks, were both graduates of The Haverford School

Good upbringing: Both Scott and Brooks the posh attended Haverford College. A private, nonsectarian, preparatory boys' school outside Philadelphia

Scott would receive bulk shipments from a California supplier which would be shipped to his Haverford apartment, which allegedly served as his base of operations.

Ferman said local students would be drafted into the drug distribution operation as sub-dealers to allegedly distribute cocaine, marijuana, hash oil and ecstasy.

'The high school sub-dealers were encouraged to develop their business so they could sell at least one pound of marijuana each week,' Ferman said.

Brooks - who Ferman said acted as the supervisor of the student dealers - instructed them to make sure there was 'never a drought,' Ferman said. He wanted dealers to make certain there was always a constant supply in the assigned schools.

If the dealers met their weekly quota, the incentives included a lower purchase price for marijuana in order to increase their profit margin.

Ferman said investigators learned about the 'Main Line Take Over Project' through confidential informants and conducted a one-day round-up in February.

In that operation, prosecutors said they confiscated 8 lbs. of marijuana, 3 grams of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of Ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded handgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and AR-15 style rifle.

Most of the contraband came from Scott's Haverford apartment, authorities said

Investigators found approximately eight pounds of marijuana, three pounds of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded AR-15 assault rifle, a loaded 9mm pistol, and a loaded .22 AR-15 style rifle along with ammunition for all of those guns.

During the four-month investigation, text messages revealed Scott gave Brooks advice on how to expand the marijuana sales in high schools, investigators say. Brooks then supervised sub-dealers who sold marijuana at local high schools.

Brooks and Scott are former graduates of The Haverford School. They also played lacrosse at a Montgomery County private school and coached youth sports leagues.

Ferman says the two men exploited those relationships to help build their drug operation.

Scott, who is being held on $1 million bail, covered his face and shouted expletives at reporters attempting to get comment following his arraignment on Monday afternoon. His attorney declined comment saying he had just gotten the case.

Brook's attorney said the teen 'lost his way' and is remorseful. His parents posted the $25,000 bail to release him from jail.

Another one on the list: Conestoga High School is another of the eight schools and colleges that have apparently been caught up in the drugs ring

Caught in the act: Lafayette College another of the private coeducational liberal arts and engineering schools whose name has now been tarnished by the alleged drug ring

Eight suspects have been arrested, and authorities say at least three more are involved.

Officials say the drug trafficking operation focused on distributing drugs to students at Lower Merion High School, The Haverford School, Harriton High School, Conestoga High School, Radnor High School, Haverford College, Lafayette College and Gettysburg College.

In addition to Scott and Brooks, seven alleged 'sub-dealers' were also charged. They are: Daniel McGrath, 18, a student at The Haverford School; John Rosemann, 20, a student at Lafayette College; Christian Euler, 23, a graduate of The Haverford School and student at Lafayette College; Garrett Johnson, 18, a student at Haverford College; Reid Cohen, 18, a Haverford College student; Willow Orr, 22; Domenic Curcio, 29.

Two juveniles, a 17-year-old Radnor High School student and 17-year-old Lower Merion High School student, have also been petitioned by the DA's office.
