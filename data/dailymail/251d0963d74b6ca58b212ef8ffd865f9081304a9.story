When quitting a job, most of us would have something else lined up - but not Coronation Street's Michelle Keegan.

Showing the brassy qualities of her character Tina McIntyre, she's walking out on Britain's biggest show in June - her first and only acting role - even if it means a spell of unemployment.

'There's no plan,' she says. 'I'm going to go with the flow and if I get another job straight away, great, but if I don't then I don't. I have things in the pipeline but nothing's set in stone.'

Michelle isn't worried about having a spat of unemployment when she leaves Corrie this June

It looks like a bold decision, especially now there's no way back - after initially telling her she could return, the producers decided Tina would be murdered. Says Michelle, 'When they told me I was being killed off, I got a bit nervous.'

Michelle, 26, who's won a host of awards, can take comfort from those who've left Corrie and gone on to impressive careers. 'Suranne Jones went on to do amazing things, and Kate Kelly hasn't stopped working since leaving. I'd love to follow suit. I'd like to do a bit of drama, a bit of comedy. Lots of variation, ideally.'

She first set foot on the Corrie cobbles in 2008, less than a year after starting to train as an actor, as the short-term girlfriend of David Platt. 'From day one I felt like an imposter. I didn't feel I had a right to be there,' says the Stockport-born actress. 'I'm a Northern girl who grew up watching Corrie, so it was a massive deal.'

Michelle has been on the set of Coronation Street for six years

Michelle admits dealing with the overnight fame was tricky. 'It's a different sort of fame when you're in a soap,' she admits. 'People feel as though they know you, and nothing prepares you for that.'

And her strangest fan mail? 'I was sent an engagement ring with a proposal. The guy said he wanted me to wear it so everyone would know we were engaged. I had to send it back.'

In her six years on the show, Michelle's been at the heart of gripping storylines, including having a secret abortion, accusing Gail Platt of murdering her father, and becoming a surrogate mother for friends.

Her decision to leave has the backing of her fiancé, reality star turned radio and TV host Mark Wright, 27. The pair got engaged last September after a nine-month courtship and will wed in the summer.

'The idea of marriage is so appealing and with Mark I knew straight away,' she insists. She says she wants four children. 'My mum's told me how exhausting it is but when the time comes I'll be ready.'

But until June, Corrie is Michelle's main focus - as her on-screen affair with married Peter Barlow becomes increasingly messy, with Tina and Peter's wife both telling him they're pregnant. 'Tina's excited at the prospect of being a mum,' says Michelle.

'She thinks if she's pregnant with Peter's child she'll be more than just the mistress. So she's going to be very hurt and angry if she finds out Carla's pregnant too - and I'm sure she'll want to make Peter pay.'

Cats or dogs? Dogs. I have two,  a sausage dog called Phoebe and  a Chihuahua named Pip. Celebrity Big Brother or Don’t Tell The Bride? Don’t Tell The Bride – although sometimes I’m horrified by what the groom is doing!Mojito or Piña Colada? Piña Colada - it reminds me of holidays!Italian or Chinese? I love Italian. My favourite dish is probably a creamy pasta one like a carbonara.Holidays: sun or snow? Definitely sun. I’ve never been skiing, though people say you love it once you try it.Courteney Cox or Jennifer Aniston? Jennifer Aniston for her rom-coms.Club or pub? I love a good pub meal, but for a night out it really has to be a club or bar.
