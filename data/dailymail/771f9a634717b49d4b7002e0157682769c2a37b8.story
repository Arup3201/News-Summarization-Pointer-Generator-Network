This is the moment a sex attacker jumped into a woman's car as she drove away from a petrol forecourt and subject her to an horrific assault at knifepoint.

The woman, who is in her 20s, is said to have been left 'truly devastated' by the attack which happened on a busy road in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, on Thursday evening.

The victim bravely fought back against the attacker and was left with injuries to her head and hand.

Horrific: A man is pictured approaching the car of a young woman moments before he jumped into her car and sexually assaulted her at knifepoint

She was about to drive away from the forecourt of a Shell petrol station when the man opened the passenger door and got into her grey 4x4.

He forced the woman to drive to a nearby residential road in Luton, Bedfordshire, and sexually assaulted her for around 15 minutes.

The woman managed to sound her car horn and turn on an interior light while trying to fight off the attacker.

After the assault she drove home and contacted the police.

Detectives from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit have today released CCTV images of the attacker getting into the car.

He is described as being a white male, around five feet ten inches to six feet tall and of slim to medium build.

He was wearing dark trousers which 
possibly had logo on them or fluorescent markings, and short zips at the
bottom on the outsides.

The attacker was also wearing a dark hooded jacket with the hood up and pulled tight round his face.

He had already tried to force his way into another woman's car just moments earlier.

'The victim has been left truly devastated by what happened but has been courageous enough to share with officers exactly what happened during this ordeal and she continues to receive support from her family and specialist officers at this time.

'We have spoken with another woman who we have confirmed was approached by this same man two minutes before this incident, she had her car door locked so he was unable to gain entry to her vehicle.'

'I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around the petrol station in Poynters Road to get in touch - In particular, were you the jogger who ran past the Shell petrol station at 6.52pm? You could have information vital to this investigation.

'Likewise, I'd like to hear from anyone who saw the dark grey 4x4 vehicle parked in Tomlinson Avenue to make contact with the police as soon as possible.'
