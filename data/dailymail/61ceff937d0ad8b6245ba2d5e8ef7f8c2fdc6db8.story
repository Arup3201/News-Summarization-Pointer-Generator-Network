More than one firearm has gone missing every month from the Ministry of Defence  since the Coalition was formed in May 2010, figures reveal.

Overall, some 56 weapons have been lost or stolen over the past four years, the Government admitted following a Freedom of Information request.

Labour has demanded a ‘full investigation’ into how the deadly weapons were lost amid heightened fears over terror attacks on British soldiers following last year’s tragic Lee Rigby killing.

Fears have been raised that Minister of Defence weapons are finding their way into the hands of gangsters and criminals

In the 10 months to the end of October this year eight firearms were lost or stolen from the Minister of Defence. 

The year before, 18 were taken, down from 21 in 2012. In 2011, meanwhile, just nine went missing.

The figures were released after a freedom of information request asking the Government to include the number of tasers, pistols and fully-automatic rifles which were unaccounted for.

It comes after figures released earlier this year revealed military bullets were being used by gangsters in British cities.

Almost 2,000 bullets were lost or stolen from the Ministry of Defence last year.

Documents revealed British military ammunition was responsible for 46 per cent of the bullets discharged in the Merseyside area between April and October 2012.

Shadow defence secretary said the security breach had to be taken 'extremely seriously'

In December 2007, the Ministry of Defence revealed the gun used to shoot WPC Rachael Bown, 24, in the stomach in Nottingham in 2006 had been stolen from the Army.

The Browning 9mm pistol used in the attack had been stolen from a British military base or smuggled by troops from Afghanistan or Iraq and sold to thugs by a soldier.

Vernon Coaker, Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary, attacked the lax security allowing guns and bullets onto the streets.

He said: ‘At a time when our servicemen and women are under threat from terrorism, the theft or loss of even one firearm from the Armed Forces within the UK must be taken extremely seriously.

‘The public needs to have confidence that every effort is being made to prevent these security breaches. 

'But the government is refusing to provide any details about how, where and when these guns went missing.

‘We need to be sure that there has been a full investigation in to each incident and that lessons have been learned to prevent this sort of thing occurring in the future.’

An MOD spokesperson said: 'We take the security of firearms and ammunition very seriously and have robust procedures to deter and prevent losses and thefts.

'Given the dynamic nature of military training and, in particular, deployed operations it is impossible to prevent all losses but every instance is fully and rigorously investigated working alongside the civilian police where appropriate.'
