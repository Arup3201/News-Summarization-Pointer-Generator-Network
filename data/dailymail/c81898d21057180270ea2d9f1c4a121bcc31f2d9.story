Armed robber Charles Bronson, who was born Michael Gordon Peterson attacked a dozen staff at Full Sutton prison in York

Charles Bronson is to sell off pieces of his artwork to raise money to send his mother on holiday as an apology for attacking 12 prison guards after the FA Cup final, it emerged yesterday.

The career criminal, who is a fanatical Tottenham Hotspur fan was outraged after north London rivals Arsenal beat Hull in the FA Cup.

The armed robber was especially annoyed as Hull went two goals ahead before being defeated in extra time. In response, Bronson smeared himself in Lurpack butter and attacked a dozen prison officers.

Bronson's mother Eira, 85, is said to have been upset by her son's latest rampage in Full Sutton prison in York on May 17 after Arsenal's latest FA Cup success.

Now, Bronson, 61, has instructed Ronnie Kray's ex-wife Katie to include several of his own artworks in a sale of gangster memorabilia being auctioned on June 17.

The paintings are being sold by JP Humbert auctioneers in Towcester, Northants and are expected to reach at least £5,000.

Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert describes the works as 'a peak into the mind of an intelligent man with some issues'.

Bronson uses art to explain some of his darkest fantasies and his mental struggles.

One picture shows eight books stacked on top of each other each with parts of Bronson’s life named on the spine, with various terrifying faces around it inside a cell.

Each painting will have a minimum estimate of between £400-£600. There are a total of ten Charles Bonson related items included in the sale.

The 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur fan was outraged by these jubilant scenes following Arsenal's 11th FA Cup victory in Wembley Stadium last month

Bronson has written to Ronnie Kray's ex-wife Kate to sell ten items of memorabilia including several of his artworks, including this one titled 'A day in the life of life' which has an auction estimate of £400-£600

According to Mr Humbert: 'Charles Bronson recently had a ‘rumble’ with twelve prison guards.

'In a letter to Kate Kray, he states remorse at upsetting his mother and accordingly, asked if some of his artwork could be included in the sale so as to generate funds to send his mother on holiday.

'The intimate and personal nature of these never-before seen Kray items and Bronson paintings show a real human side to these larger than life personalities.

'Although they are bound to polarise opinions, the lots, much like the individuals, are far from dull.

'It’s almost impossible to say how much they will go for, the market will dictate that, but with his art selling for up to £1,000 a piece in the past there will be a lot of interest.

'We have already had a lot of people phoning up to ask about the pictures.

'They are a peak into the mind of an intelligent man who, well lets say, has had a lot of issues.

'I would put an initial estimate of £400 to £600 but that is a starting estimate.

'There is no reserve on it, and I fully expect us to see a lot of interest in two weeks when it goes on sale. This is a very important and eclectic sale of British social history.'

Bronson wants to use the funds generated from the sale to send his mother Eira Peterson on holiday as an apology for his most recent prison rampage

In one of the artworks for sale in the auction, Bronson, 61, calls for Kate Kray to be appointed prime minister and claims to have been 'born insane'

He is also selling a handwritten poem entitled Asylum about Ronnie Kray

Bronson was jailed for seven years following a raid on a post office in 1974.  In the past 40 years, he has only been a free man for just four months and nine days. He has spent a total of 36 years in solitary confinement due to his violent outbursts.

Much of his artwork relates to violent scenes involving prison offers and have featured in exhibitions around the globe.

He has taken hostages in ten different sieges as well as injuring 30 prison officers. He has caused at least £500,000 worth of damages in rooftop protests.

In 1999, he was sentenced to life for taking education worker Phil Danielson hostage for 44 hours for criticism of his art.

In one of his more unusual artworks, Bronson features a fantasy visit to the beach, which is also for sale later this month
