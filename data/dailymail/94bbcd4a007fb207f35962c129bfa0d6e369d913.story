A pre-pubescent girl appointed as a 'living goddess' by Hindus and Buddhists has made a rare public appearance in Nepal during a religious festival.

The Kumari, a young girl dressed in a red and golden costume who is worshipped by thousands, is appointed as an incarnation of the goddess Kali and only appears 13 times a year.

As part of her sheltered existence, she spends the rest of the year in a temple away from the public, and only appears among others for special occasions.

Child-like: Matina, the latest Kumari goddess, was just three years old when she was bestowed with the title of Royal Kumari

The latest Kumari, Matina Shakya, was three-years-old when she took her seat as Royal Kumari in August 2010 in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu.

The Kumari is known in Nepal as the protector from evil and the bestower of good luck and prosperity.

The Kumari, literally meaning 'virgin', is a young girl chosen from the Buddhist community to represent a Hindu goddess after she passes 32 tests of 'perfection'.

These are said to include 'having a body like a banyan tree and golden, tender skin which has never been scratched or shed a drop of blood.'

'Living Goddess Kumari' Matina was today carried through a crowd of onlookers as she attended the Changu Narayan festival in Kathmandu.

The Kumaris are a major tourist attraction and are revered until they menstruate, after which they return to the family and a new one is chosen.

One of Matina's predecessors, Sajani Shakya, made international headlines in 2007 after she visited the United States to promote a film by a British company about the Kumari system.

Under the system, the head priest of Nepal's former monarchy appointed 'Kumaris' - considered to be incarnations of the goddess Kali - in several towns in the Kathmandu valley.

The monarchy was abolished in May when Nepal became a republic.

Some religious authorities criticised Sajani's trip saying it was against tradition, and Sajani retired at the request of her family.

According to Kumari tradition, girls selected from Buddhist Newar families through a rigorous cultural process become the 'living goddesses'.

In 2008 Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the government to safeguard the Kumari's human rights after complaints that the practice went against the child living a normal life.
