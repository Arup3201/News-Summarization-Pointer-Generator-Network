Jahi McMath, the brain dead 13-year-old at the center of a battle to turn off her life support machine, may not 'make it through the day' after hospital treatment left her weaker than first thought, her lawyer told MailOnline.

Chris Dolan said Jahi, pronounced brain dead after a tonsil operation, had 'deteriorated' more than expected because her body had been 'starved' while on a ventilator at Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California.

Jahi was released from the hospital into the care of her family last night after a bitter and high profile battle with doctors treating her.

Fears: The condition of Jahi, left, who was handed over to her family on a ventilator after a high-profile battle has deteriorated overnight

Dolan added that she had arrived at a secret facility this morning where she was receiving the best treatment available.

But he said it was touch and go whether she 'would make it'.

'Jahi is in worse shape than we thought,' Dolan said. 'The hospital’s withdrawal of nutrients has caused her to deteriorate more rapidly than we thought. It is just sad. They have starved her.'

Asked whether doctors hired by the family were going to fit a feeding tube, he said that they were assessing the situation right now.

'Because of the amount of damage to her throat she is not doing very well,' he said.

'Jahi is in very bad shape. Right now we don’t know if she is going to make it. The doctors are doing everything they can to help her make it through the day.'

His comments came after the family finally moved Jahi from the hospital where she has been on a ventilator since suffering complications on December 9.

The hospital had wanted to turn off the ventilator after she had been pronounced brain dead by three doctors and the local coroner had issued a death certificate.

But the family, led by her mother Nailah Winkfield and uncle Omari Sealey, refused to accept there was no hope and agreed to take 'full responsibility' for Jahi if the hospital released her.

They claimed that with the right care she could make a recovery.

But the hospital insisted the girl could not be be rehabilitated.

Spokesman Sam Singer yesterday criticized the family's decision to give Jahi 'nutrients' to maintain her brain at optimum efficiency.

'This is a deceased young woman,' Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer told ABC 7.

'No amount of food, medicine, medical machinery, time or hope is going to bring back her back. So it's really wrong and unethical for Mr Dolan to mislead the family and the public that there's any amount of hope or any food that could possibly bring back this deceased young woman.'

Jahi left Oakland's Children’s Hospital & Research Center about 7.50pm in a critical care ambulance to the home of her mom, Latasha Winkfield.

Before today's turn of events, the teenager's uncle said the family was 'ecstatic'.

Hope: Jahi's parents are hoping to transfer the little girl to a permanent care facility. While the exact center is unknown, Allyson Scerri, who runs New Beginnings Community Center in New York has offered her services

Inspiration: Scerri founded the facility after her father, Al Barone, sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007

'I was with her when she left the hospital and the family is very grateful for this day,' Omari Sealey said. 'We are pleased she is away from Children's Hospital which has been trying to pull the plug on my niece since December 12.

'We fought and we fought to make sure she had a chance at recovery.

'She will now be treated like the precious little girl that she is.'

The hospital last night said it wished the family 'closure' over the traumatic affair.

'Our hearts go out to the family as they
 grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace,' they said in a statement.

The
 news comes after the girl's family yesterday said they had ‘everything
 in place’ to move Jahi from the hospital to a long term care facility.

Dolan said his clients had medical staff, transport and a 
new home for the teenager and were just about to ‘get it all in motion’.

While it is not clear where the girl 
will be moved to, a New York facility run by a woman whose father suffered 
severe brain trauma in 2007 has offered its services.

New Beginnings Community Center founder Allyson Scerri said the outpatient rehabilitation facility has been named as a potential care center for Jahi.

'We
 are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open 
our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care as an inpatient, 
long-term facility for Jahi with the required and appropriate medical 
staff that she depends upon,' Scerri said in a letter included in court 
documents last week, according to Koco.com.

War of words: Children's Hospital Oakland 
spokesman Sam Singer (right) has accused Christopher Dolan, the lawyer 
representing Jahi's family (left), of misleading people about Jahi's 
likely recovery

According to the facility's website, Scerri founded the facility after her father, Al Barone, sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007.

Seeing
 her father, a man of great strength and independence, inadequately 
cared for was an unacceptable frustration for Scerri, the website says.

The businesswoman told CNN she believes McMath could get better, with appropriate care.

'Her
 brain needs time to heal. It's a new injury,' Scerri said. 'We believe 
in life after injury, all of us here at New Beginnings have first-hand 
experience because we have a loved one that was in the same situation as
 Jahi.'

Jahi's family has raised more than 
$47,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her. According to the site, more than 
1,300 people have donated money in nine days.
