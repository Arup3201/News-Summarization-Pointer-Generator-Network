Proven: The Advertising Standards Authority has dismissed complaints that Fairy adverts are 'misleading' as the company can prove its washing up liquid lasts twice as long as other brands

Fairy Liquid really does last twice as long as rival brands, the advertising watchdog ruled today.

For more than 60 years, TV viewers have been told that Fairy Liquid lasts twice as long as other washing up liquids, accompanied by the jingle 'Now hands that do dishes can feel soft as your face, with mild green Fairy Liquid'.

Although challenges have come and gone, it was not until today that the claim - made since Fairy first hit our shelves in 1950 - was 'proven'.

Amazingly, it was a complaint from rivals Persil which backfired after bosses complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the claim in the Fairy advert that it lasted 'twice as long' was misleading and could not be substantiated.

The ASA investigated TV and digital billboard adverts, which showed one bottle of Fairy against two bottles of an 'unknown' rival.

As the advert continues the bottles start emptying, with the one bottle of Fairy lasting as long as two bottles of the rival brand.

A voiceover states: 'Generations have trusted Fairy's cleaning power because it lasts a long, long time. And today it lasts twice as long as the next best-selling brand. That's Fairyconomy.'

Bosses at Persil complained to the ASA and challenged claims that Fairy lasted twice as long as the 'next best-selling brand'.

Persil also challenged whether the ads made a 'fair comparison' and that the adverts were misleading as they neglected to mention critical information, such as the concentration and size of the bottles.

The ASA, however, cleared the advert, saying it was not misleading as Fairy - owned by Procter & Gamble - could prove its claims.

It also stated that the size of the 
Fairy 433ml bottle on show - which in a 2012 review by Which? magazine 
was found to wash the equivalent of 4,292 plates - was actually smaller 
than the two 500ml rival brands on show. 

The advertising watchdog stated: 'The ASA noted the ads showed images of the advertised product beside an equals sign and two unbranded bottles of washing-up liquid.

'The ads also made clear that Fairy lasted twice as long as the next best-selling brand and that the next best-selling brand was based on AC Nielsen volume share data, which we understood identified that brand as Persil.

'We considered consumers would understand from the shape and comparative size of the bottles that the images were of the 433ml Fairy bottles and two 500ml Persil bottles.

'In that context, we considered consumers would interpret the ads to mean that a standard 433ml bottle of Fairy lasted as long as two standard 500ml bottles of Persil when used in conditions representative of everyday use.

'The expert considered the test reflected the practices of consumers and demonstrated that Fairy lasted at least twice as long as Persil'

'We sought expert advice on the robustness of the evidence provided by Procter & Gamble.

'The expert considered the test reflected the practices of consumers and demonstrated that Fairy lasted at least twice as long as Persil.

'On that basis, we considered the claims that Fairy lasted twice as long as the next best-selling brand had been substantiated.'

The ASA added: 'The ads also made clear 
that the next best-selling brand was based on AC Nielsen volume share 
data, which we understood identified that brand as Persil.

Cleared: The Advertising Standards Authority found Fairy was not in breach of guidelines as its adverts 'objectively compared a material, relevant and representative feature of those products'

'Because the ads focused on the mileage of the products, we considered consumers would understand that the comparison was between the longevity of the Fairy product and that of the Persil product.

Last month the ASA ruled Boeing did not mislead readers of trade magazine Flight International when promoting the advantages of its 747-8 jet over the A380 model of rival Airbus, which had complained to the watchdog.

Boeing said its model has a '26 per cent cost advantage' per trip - and is '8 per cent more efficient' in kerosene consumption per seat.

Also in August 2013, Sainsbury's said it would appeal an ASA decision to dismiss its complaint on Tesco's Price Promise comparison scheme. 

Sainsbury's said Tesco's initiative was unfair for comparing own-label products, but the ASA stated the basis of Tesco's scheme was 'clear'.

'Furthermore, we considered the images made clear that a standard 433ml bottle of Fairy lasted as long as two standard 500ml bottles of Persil.

'In comparing the mileage of the products, we considered the ads objectively compared a material, relevant, verifiable and representative feature of those products.

'We considered information about the concentration of the liquid and the size and price of the bottle was not material information in relation to ads that made clear that the basis of the comparison was the mileage of the products.

'Because the ads objectively compared a material, relevant, verifiable and representative feature of those products and because they did not omit material information in respect of the mileage comparison, we concluded the ads were not in beach.'

Bosses at Procter & Gamble - which make Fairy - said it had used the Build Up Suds (BUS) test on the 'mileage' of Fairy and Persil, which showed it lasted twice as long and was 'two times better value than Persil.'
