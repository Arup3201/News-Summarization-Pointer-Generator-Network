Cutting his teeth: Stewart came through the ranks at White Hart Lane

Stewart can play at right or left back and played four games while on loan at Crewe in 2013 but failed to make a senior appearance for Spurs although he did feature in last year's pre-season campaign.

Born in London, Stewart joined Tottenham’s academy in 2010.

Along with a picture of himself in a 
Liverpool strip as a youngster, he tweeted: ‘Delighted to have signed 
for LFC! It’s been a dream of mine from a kid! Thank you for all of the 
welcoming messages!’
