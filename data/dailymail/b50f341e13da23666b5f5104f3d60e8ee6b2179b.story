If you like the thrill of the open road but love the comfort of a luxury car, this unique superbike could be the perfect solution.

The electric motorbike, dubbed the C-1, is a bizarre combination of car and bike and is set to hit our roads late next year.

Created by San Francisco-based automotive company, Lit Motors, the fully-enclosed two-passenger bike uses a gyroscopic stabilising system to stay upright even when it's stationary.

Clever: The C-1 stays upright, even when it's stationary

Luxury: The C-1 comes with a host of creature comforts with the makers claiming that it's a unique vehicle

The futuristic bike not only keeps its occupants warm and dry, it also keeps them safe - refusing to fall over even when hit in an accident.

But this motorbike doesn't come cheap, it will set buyers back a hefty £15,000 with prices only dropping to £10,000 when production increases.

A spokesman at Lit Motors said many people had tried to create something similar in the past but no-one had succeeded.

He said: ‘No other vehicles on the road use gyros in this manner. There have been previous attempts but nothing like what we're doing.

‘Think of a child's spinning top toy, as long as it spins, it remains upright on its own, with no outside help. Similarly, as long as the gyros are spinning, the C-1 remains upright.

‘Ours is the only bike which stands upright on its own without training wheels.

Best of both worlds: The makers say their invention combines the safety of a car with the fun of a motorbike

‘This allows for a whole host of car-like features like a bucket seat, a steering wheel, a dashboard, climate control, a sound system, seatbelts and multiple airbags.

‘It is absolutely the first of its kind. The C-1 is a completely new class of vehicle, neither car nor motorcycle.

‘We have married the efficiency, agility, small size, and fun of a motorcycle with the stability, convenience, and most importantly the safety of a car.

‘The increased agility and smaller size as compared to a car means that many accidents can be avoided in the first place.

‘Rather than having to wear a helmet the driver can wear normal clothes, even a suit. The driver will stay safe being fully enclosed in a steel roll cage.

Green credentials: The C-1 is fully electric, so it doesn't contribute to urban pollution

‘We intend to take the C-1 around the world, starting in California and North America, then out to Europe, East Asia, Australia, South Asia, South America, and beyond.

‘We think it will be revolutionary and wildly popular. We're expecting a really strong following because we've created a new class of vehicle.

‘We've designed the perfect urban, commuter vehicle. It is fully electric, so not contributing to urban air pollution at all.’
