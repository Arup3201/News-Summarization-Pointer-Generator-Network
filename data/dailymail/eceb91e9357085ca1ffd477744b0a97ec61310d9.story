An Ohio father-of-two has become the second skier in just over a month to die on a treacherous slope at a Maryland ski resort.

Curt Winklevoss, 38, from Upper Arlington, was killed on Friday after he lost control while traveling fast down an expert run named Squirrel Cage, at Maryland's Wisp Resort near McHenry.

The man's wife, Allison, was skiing ahead of him when he veered off the steep run, which was icy at the time, and crashed, at about 1:30 p.m.

The ski patrol rushed to his aid but it was too late. He was taken to nearby Garrett County Memorial Hospital where he was  pronounced dead.

On January 19, Rockville man James Jung-Jin Park, 40, crashed into trees and died while skiing the treacherous slope with friends.

Winklevoss' mother, Karen Winklevoss, told The Columbus Dispatch her son was a 'wonderful skier' and that his tragic death was 'just a freak accident.'

'He caught an edge and he went into a tree,' she said.

The man had been on a family trip to 
his parents' Deep Creek Lake home, and the parents were caring for Curt 
Winklevoss' five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter when the 
accident happened.

The project superintendent loved spending time outdoors in western Maryland, his mother said.

'It's just so totally unfair,' Karen Winkelvoss told the Dispatch. 'It’s just too soon. We're going to miss him terribly.'

Wisp is Maryland's only ski resort. It announced in December that it had emerged from bankruptcy protection under a new management firm.

The previous owners filed for 
bankruptcy protection after defaulting on loans to build a golf course 
community near the ski hill.

Wisp's vice president of facilities and public affairs Jerry Geisler insisted the two deaths in rapid succession were simply 'a rare coincidence.'

'There's nothing wrong with the ski slope,' he told The Dispatch, adding that the man's father used to be a ski instructor at the resort.

'Everyone there is just heartbroken. It's just a real tragedy.'
