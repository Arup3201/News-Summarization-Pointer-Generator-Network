Multi-million plan investment: US Tycoon Donald Trump at Trump International Golf Links, Scotland

US tycoon Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a new multi-million pound investment in his Scottish golf resort - despite previously vowing to halt all developments on the 200-acre site.

The billionaire will be submitting a proposal for a number of additions to Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, including staff accommodation, a banquet hall and 400-capacity ballroom.

The move comes two years after he threatened not to invest 'another penny' in the project over plans to build an offshore wind farm off the Aberdeen coast, which he said would spoil scenic views.

In a statement released on the planning proposals, The Trump Organization claimed Swedish utility firm Vattenfall, the primary developers behind the farm, could no longer finance the project.

It also said the technology 'is now widely regarded to be obsolete and outdated'.

The company said that this, combined with other stakeholders withdrawing from the project, had led to confidence being restored that the 'shoreline will not be blighted' by the 'industrial energy plant'.

Despite this, Mr Trump will continue his legal challenge to the decision to grant the farm planning permission off the Aberdeen coast.  

A spokesman denied this claim on behalf of Vattenfall, and its project partners, Aberdeen Renewable Energy group, stating that they 'want to see the scheme to come to fruition'.  

Mr Trump called Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, which opened in July 2012, 'one of his greatest achievements' and said his commitment to develop the site 'was stronger than ever'. 

The businessman is now pushing ahead with expanding the site, known collectively as the Menie Estate, with further applications for private houses and hotel rooms tabled for later in the year.

His current application includes public notifications for a second gold course and additional hotel accommodation and facilities at the five-star MacLeod House and Lodge, named after his mother.  

George Sorial, executive vice-president of the Trump Organisation, said: 'This will be a substantial investment - it really will allow us to carry out the original vision that Mr Trump had for the entire site. Our work there is not done.'

News that the organization would be re-investing in the site was welcomed by business leaders. 

Ian Armstrong, regional director for the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, said: 'At a time when there are some economic clouds on the horizon, the announcement of the plans by the Trump Organisation for further substantial investment in their site at Menie is a great boost to the region.

'The significance of a major international investor looking beyond short-term issues and adopting a long-term view should not be underestimated in terms of the fillip it provides to the north-east of Scotland and its economy.'

Robert Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, added: 'The business community in the north-east will be pleased to welcome the continued investment in Trump International Golf Links.' 

The claims made by Trump Organizations were denied by Vattenfall and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group.

A spokesman said: 'Widely accepted as a much-needed centre of significant European importance, the EOWDC is pivotal to helping the Scottish and UK Governments meet their ambitious renewable energy targets and is planned to test and demonstrate innovation and next generation technologies.

'It would also be an integral, flagship project for Aberdeen City and Shire’s enterprising Energetica initiative, further positioning the region at the forefront of the sustainable energy evolution as well as supporting the diversification of its energy-based economy.'
