The document also makes note of her love of running, saying under 'Personal Time' that she requests '1 hour (early morning) for exercise.'

In an interview with Fairfax while in the US earlier in the year, Ms Bishop said that despite working 20-hour days, she makes a point of going for a run no matter where she is.

The Foreign Minister said she tries to 'keep fit and healthy and that allows me to focus'. 

Her role has seen her visit the US, China, Fiji, and Afghanistan, plus act in an official capacity at the G20 and APEC Summits in the past four weeks alone, proving a hectic schedule.

The document also makes note of her love of running, saying under 'Personal Time' that she requests '1 hour (early morning) for exercise.'

The Foreign Minister also likes to be prepared for small talk as well as large issues, with the document revealing that she likes to be given a 'snippet' of local information 'to start conversation'

Her morning jogs have become known among other foreign staff, who often join her in her precious sole hour of 'alone time' in her hectic day.

The minister is also not a coffee drinker, despite only sleeping for four hours a night, noting that 'We don't have time for that'.

She prefers 'English Breakfast tea with skim milk or peppermint tea', but isn't demanding, noting that there is 'no need to provide in hotel room.'

Ms Bishop 'Prefers sparkling water, however will drink wine or Champagne at appropriate functions,' the document states. 

The Foreign Minister also likes to be prepared for small talk as well as large issues, with the document revealing that she likes to be given a 'snippet' of local information 'to start conversation with interlocuters', and gives the example of meeting New York Mayor as 'Yankees scraped into the finals this week'.

It is also important for her to have gift wrap, scissors, and tape on hand, in order to wrap presents she might need to present to hosts or other leaders.
