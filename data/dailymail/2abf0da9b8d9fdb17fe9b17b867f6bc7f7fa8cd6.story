Veteran actor Sir Michael Gambon wears an earpiece while acting in case he forgets his lines.

The 73-year-old, who is best known for playing Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films, said that he has had himself checked by two doctors for Alzheimer’s disease because he is so worried by his memory loss.

He said: ‘The good news is that that’s not the case.

Fearful: Michael Gambon wears an earpiece on stage in case he forgets his lines

‘It’s a real worry but there’s not much I can do about it.’ 

Gambon revealed the secret of his earpiece to an audience at the HighTide festival in Halesworth, Suffolk, adding: ‘A girl speaks into it to give me my lines.’

The Irish-born actor – who began his stage career with minor Shakespearean roles alongside Lord Olivier – confessed that it was his ‘overwhelming fear’ of forgetting his words on stage that forced him to pull out of a 2009 National Theatre production of The Habit of Art by Alan Bennett.

At the time, it was simply announced he had pulled out because of ‘ill health’. Richard Griffiths, who had starred in Bennett’s 2004 play The History Boys, replaced him.

Gambon said that he now believes the only roles he can play on stage are those with few lines, such as butlers.

He added: ‘You know, the sort of part where he comes on and says a few words.

‘A role that’s played for laughs – like when the phone goes, he doesn’t know where it is.’ 

The actor revealed that he was recently approached by the director Sir Trevor Nunn, adding: ‘He said he’d got a part for me in a play. I asked him if it was a butler. He said no.

‘I then said, “Well, a part that’s like a butler?”’

Next month, Gambon will perform in a Berlin production of Samuel Beckett’s play Eh Joe.

He said: ‘The great thing is that it’s a silent part with no words. I just sit still, facing a camera, with all of the emotions of my face projected.

‘After half an hour I have to cry.’

His next television role will be in a BBC One drama called Common in June.

Gambon became well known in 1986 when he starred in BBC crime drama The Singing Detective.

He took over the part of Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore in the third Harry Potter film after Richard Harris died in 2002, aged 72.

He said: ‘Richard Harris had just died and they approached me and I decided to play it with a posh Irish accent, rather like Harris.

‘I’d never seen any of the previous films but working on the series was huge fun - and for lots of dosh.’

Gambon also told how he trained as an engineer before becoming an actor, and once dreamed of being an airline pilot.

He said: ‘I’ve had a private pilot’s licence for years and flown all round the UK and over to France.’

However he said he is now limited to doing ‘circuits and bumps’ around airfields.

Finally, Gambon spoke about the famous directors he has worked with, adding: ‘Harold Pinter would shout at me, though less than at the other actors.

‘He also told me off for what he said was behaving like a ballet dancer.’
