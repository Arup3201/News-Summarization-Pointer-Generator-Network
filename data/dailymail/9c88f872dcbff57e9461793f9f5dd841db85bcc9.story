Gingrich extremely critical of Ronald Reagan, says former colleague

Romney edges slightly ahead of Gingrich in latest poll

Newt Gingrich promised last night to establish a permanent base on the moon by 2020 if he's elected as U.S. president.

Gingrich, the former House speaker, told a packed room that he wanted to develop a robust commercial space industry in line with the airline boom of the 1930s, leading to a permanent base on the moon.

On a campaign stop ahead of the Florida primary next Tuesday, the GOP presidential hopeful told an audience in Cocoa, on Florida's space coast, his plan would benefit 'science, tourism and manufacturing'.

Gingrich, the former House speaker, said that he wanted to develop a robust commercial space industry in line with the airline boom of the 1930s, leading to a permanent base on the moon

Gingrich, a long-time space enthusiast, also said he wanted to expand exploration of Mars, saying NASA could pay for ambitious plans by teaming up with the private sector.

The claims appeared to thrill the 700-strong crowd. The region is primarily known for NASA and was still suffering from a round of federal cuts to the space program last year.

According to the Miami Herald, Gingrich said: 'By the end of my second term. We will have the first permanent base on the moon and it will be American... Does that mean I'm visionary? You betcha.'

He added: 'We clearly have the capacity that Chinese and the Russians will never come anywhere close to us.'

Gingrich's grandiose claims to the Florida space community came as one former White House colleague, who worked with Gingrich in the 1980s under Ronald Regan, described his relationship with the former president quite differently to Gingrich often fondly remembers in speeches.

Elliott Abrams, former assistant secretary of state, said that rather than Gingrich working side by side with Regan he was often extremely vocal in his criticism.

In the National Review, Mr Abrams wrote that Gingrich's opinions of Regan's plans to defeat Communism were scathing.

He
 quotes Gingrich in 1986, as saying: 'Measured against the scale and 
momentum of the Soviet empire’s challenge, the Reagan administration has
 failed, is failing, and without a dramatic change in strategy will 
continue to fail. . . . President Reagan is clearly failing.'

'By the end of my second term. We will 
have the first permanent base on the moon and it will be American... 
Does that mean I'm visionary? You betcha.'

Mr Abrams, who was also a deputy national security adviser to George W. Bush, added that Gingrich often refused to support Regan in his political decisions - and that he was often wrong in this choice.

A poll taken before Monday night's debate between the four remaining candidates - Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul - showed little between frontrunners Romney and Gingrich.

Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt 
Romney lead former House Speaker Newt Gingrich by just two points in 
Florida, showing how close the race in a key primary had come.

Some 36 per cent of Republicans likely to vote in Florida's primary said
 they intend to vote for Romney while 34 per cent would choose Gingrich,
 according to the CNN poll last night.

Former Senator Rick Santorum garnered 13 per cent support while Representative Ron Paul won 10 per cent.

The
 poll was conducted across Florida after the South Carolina primary last
 weekend where Gingrich beat Romney by 12 points, reviving his campaign 
and showing that the race for the Republican nomination was far from 
over.

The intensity of the Republican race lead to vicious attacks by the frontrunners. At forums in Florida, Romney and Gingrich needled each other over immigration policy in the state, where 13 per cent of registered voters are Hispanic.

Gingrich also took the opportunity to
 ridicule rival Mitt Romney's call for self-deportation of illegal 
immigrants as an 'Obama-level fantasy' that would be inhumane to 
long-established families living in America.

Romney in turn accused Gingrich of 
pandering to a Hispanic audience and said the former Speaker himself had
 supported self-deportation in the past.

Gingrich criticized Romney's 
immigration policy during a forum with the Spanish-language television 
network Univision, saying the idea of self-deportation would never work.
 Romney retaliated later in the day at the same forum.

During
 a debate earlier this week, Romney said he favors self-deportation over
 policies that would require the federal government to round up millions
 of illegal immigrants and send them back to their home countries.

Advocates of Romney's approach argue that illegal immigration can be 
curbed by denying public benefits, prompting illegals to leave the U.S. 
on their own.

'You have to 
live in a world of Swiss bank accounts and Cayman Island accounts and 
automatically $20 million income for no work to have some fantasy this 
far from reality,' Gingrich said, alluding to details in Romney's income
 tax returns that were made public on Tuesday.

'For
 Romney to believe that somebody's grandmother is going to be so cut off
 that she is going to self-deport, I mean this is an Obama-level 
fantasy.'

However Gingrich's campaign has spoken of the self-deportation policy he ridiculed yesterday.

'I recognize that it's very tempting to come out to an audience like this and pander to the audience,' Romney said, pointing out that Gingrich has previously made comments supporting the idea of self-deportation. 'I think that was a mistake on his part.'

At the forum, Gingrich spoke instead about other elements of his immigration plan, including controlling the border and establishing a guest-worker program to better manage the influx of immigrants.

Gingrich said he favors a path to citizenship for illegal immigrant children who serve in the military but not for simply completing college.

Romney defended his opposition to allowing the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at American universities. He said there are inexpensive options that will allow them to go to college.

Gingrich told Univision he believes states should charge in-state tuition rates for students who were born in the U.S. to illegal immigrant parents, but that he favors charging out-of-state tuition for children who were brought to this country illegally.

Gingrich began the interview by 
speaking a few halting phrases of welcome in Spanish, saying 'buenos 
dias estudiantes' but begged off when moderator Jorge Ramos pressed him 
to go further. Romney did not speak any Spanish during his interview.

Romney was asked about family members
 he has living in Mexico. Romney's father, George Romney, was born in 
Mexico but moved back to the U.S. as a young child. Ramos asked Romney 
if he had a claim to being Mexican American.

'I don't think people would think I 
was being honest with them if I said I was Mexican American but I'd 
appreciate it if you'd get that word out,' Romney joked.

Both candidates addressed the future of communist Cuba after their interviews.

In a speech on Latin America policy, 
Gingrich said the U.S. needs to take a more active role in demanding 
change in Fidel Castro's Cuba, much like it did to encourage the Arab 
spring movement that toppled autocratic leaders in north Africa and the 
Middle East.

'I don't think it's ever occurred to 
anyone in the White House to look south and propose a Cuban spring,' 
Gingrich said. 'If [former Egyptian President Hosni] Mubarak was bad, 
Castro is worse.'

Romney, who has significant support 
from the Cuban-American political establishment in Miami, railed against
 Castro's regime in a speech before several hundred Cuban-American 
democracy activists.

'It is time for us to strive for 
freedom in Cuba, and I will do so as president,' he said. 'We must be 
prepared to support the voices for democracy in Cuba.'
