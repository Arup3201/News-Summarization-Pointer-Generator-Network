A father and his 12-year-old son died in a blaze sparked when an assault rifle discharged in a room packed with ammunition at their home.

Terry York, 48, is thought to have been showing his AR-15 rifle to friends in a back room at his Tennessee home when the weapon accidentally discharged on Sunday, causing a fire and a string of explosions.

Neighbours described hearing a series of explosions after Mr York's son Luke rushed into the room to help his father put out a small fire sparked when the rifle went off.

The flames 'did not seem too threatening at first', relatives of the victims said, but the blaze grew out of control after Luke came to his father's aid.

Tennessee State bomb and arson investigators, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and Henderson County Sheriff's Department are all working on establishing exactly what caused the deadly blaze, according to a report on WBBJ-TV.

Neighbour Kathleen Glass described hearing explosions emerging from the house in Huron, Henderson County.

'I just don't have the words for it because I can not imagine having to go through something like this,' she told the station.

Relatives said Mr York stored ammunition in the room where the fire broke out, a report on rawstory.com said, but officials said they would carry out a full investigation into the tragedy before reaching any conclusions.

'Any loss of life is tragic, when a child loses their life it hit the community hard,' Henderson County Sheriff Brian Duke said, adding that investigators were looking into the possibility that the fire started as a result of an accidental discharge of the weapon.

Officials said the father and son were discovered mere steps from the door out of the property, but may have been blinded by smoke as they tried to escape.

'I can’t imagine the suffering mentally, emotionally and physically that they are going through right now,' the Sheriff said of the York family.
