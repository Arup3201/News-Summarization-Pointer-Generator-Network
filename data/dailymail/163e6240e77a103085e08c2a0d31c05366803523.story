A disgraced farmer has appeared in court after he was found to have kept a pack of shivering dogs feeding on rotting pig carcasses in squalid conditions.

Animal welfare officials found collies caked in mud and fighting over the decomposing body of a dead pig on Leon Henry Smith's land in Okehampton, Devon.

Smith, 62, who was already banned from keeping cattle and sheep for previous offences, kept 13 dogs in a filthy open wire pen.

Inspectors also found the remains of dead sheep were in a horse box, along with various animal bones scattered across the field.

A judge sitting at Exeter Crown Court said he had 'grave concerns' about Smith's attitude to animal welfare.

But he deferred sentence for six months to give the farmer time to improve the conditions in which the dogs are kept.Â 

Smith admitted failing to provide a suitable environment for the 13 collie dogs on February 14 last year.

He pleaded guilty to a similar charge relating to nine of the dogs on February 16 last year and also admitted six offences of failing to dispose of pig remains and allowing them to be exposed to wild animals.

Judge Barry Cotter QC said: 'Standards in relation to animal welfare vary.

'Some people treat their dogs better than humans but what we are concerned with here is something utterly different.

'We are concerned with minimum basic standards and these are immutable and unchanging. That is what you are required to provide.

'Anyone sitting in my position is bound to have grave concerns about your attitude generally to animal welfare and your understanding of their basic needs.

'The defence may well say that these dogs were in your view in good health and had food - but you pleaded guilty because there was not an adequate environment for them faced with bad weather.

'That will simply not amount to an adequate excuse in the future, as it does not today.'

The court heard that Devon County Council began an investigation into Smith's practices following complaints from members of the public.

Sean Brunton, prosecuting, said Smith was convicted in 1998 of failing to dispose of animal by-products and in 1999 of welfare offences.

He was banned from keeping sheep and cattle for five years.

In 2008 he was convicted of both offences again, resulting in a second five-year ban - a prohibition which remains in force.

Kelly Scrivener, defending, said Smith was determined to provide good conditions for his dogs and was keen for the RSPCA to take part in any future monitoring.

Judge Cotter QC deferred sentence on all matters until November to give Smith the opportunity to improve conditions for the dogs.

He claimed this would allow Smith to avoid a disqualification from keeping them in the future.
