A Super Bowl ad has a small but vocal group incensed in the wake of Sunday night's game, but they aren't who you'd expect.

An NBC-sponsored spot starring Parks & Rec manly man Nick Offerman has angered celiac disease sufferers for its suggestion they should toughen up and watch some NASCAR.

'When our idea of danger is eating gluten, there’s trouble afoot,' says Offerman in the ad, which by Monday morning had already spurred some 18,000 people to sign a petition to remove the reference.

Controversial: Celiac sufferers are petitioning to get NBC to nix an ad for NASCAR that features Parks & Rec actor Nick Offerman because it 'makes fun of those who are gluten-free'

Posted by user 'Gluten Dude,' the petition says the ad 'makes fun of those who are gluten-free. It implies that we're soft.'

Offerman's monologue indeed references gluten once in a series of examples of how America has 'gotten soft.'

The ad's solution isn't avoiding gluten, as 3 million celiac sufferers must do every day throughout their lives, it is to 'get some NASCAR in your life.'

Gluten Dude takes issue with the suggestion, 'We're weak...we're part of America's problem.' 

'I think about all of the gluten-free children getting bullied for being "different", when all they want to do is feel better and fit in.

'When our idea of danger is eating gluten, there’s trouble afoot,' says Offerman in the ad, which by Monday morning had already spurred some 18,000 people to sign a petition to remove the reference

'I think about all of the people who have gotten sick at restaurants because the kitchen and/or the staff do not take us seriously,' he writes.

Gluten Dude wrote after seeing the ad prior to the Super Bowl that his plea, which also appears at GlutenDude.com, had been heard by NBC. 'NBC has announced they will remove the gluten reference,' he wrote Saturday.

However, the ad--complete with the gluten joke--indeed went on to come through on the televisions of 100 million people Sunday.

So NBC lied,' Gluten Dude wrote. 'They are not running the gluten reference ad ONLY online. Why am I not surprised?!'

Known only as Gluten Dude, the man behind the petition has a history of demanding attention be paid to the issue of celiac disease

Gluten is found primarily in wheat, but also in rye, barley, and to a lesser extent, oats. It makes up the protein part of these grains, and is the substance that makes bread dough elastic. 

But in a small proportion of people, gluten can't be properly digested, with the result that the surface of the intestine becomes damaged and inflamed. 

The effect is poor absorption of various nutrients, such as essential fats, vitamins and minerals (including calcium and iron).

Celiac is an autoimmine disease and undiagnosed sufferers who continue to consume gluten are at a higher risk for certain cancers and other autoimmune disorders.

No two individuals react exactly the same way to gluten intolerance. However, the commonest symptoms are diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, gas and a flaky skin rash. Untreated, celiac disease can lead to nutrient deficiencies problems, including iron deficiency anemia, chronic fatigue, weight loss and osteoporosis.
