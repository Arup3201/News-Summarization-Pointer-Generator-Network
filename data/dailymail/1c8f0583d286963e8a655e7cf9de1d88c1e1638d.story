Jermain Taylor has pleaded not guilty to charges he pointed a gun at a man's head and threatened to shoot three children at a parade in Arkansas.

A judge revoked his bond on Tuesday in a separate firearms case from August, and issued a warrant for his arrest. Prosecutors say Taylor's arrest in Little Rock is evidence that he has violated the terms of his release.

Pulaski County Jail online records show Taylor hasn't yet surrendered to authorities.

The former unified middleweight champion of the world, who has been released on bail, was arrested on Monday following the incident in Little Rock, Arkansas.

After initially posing for a photograph during the city’s Martin Luther King Junior Day parade, the mood changed when one of his belts fell to the ground.

The boxer, who currently holds the IBF middleweight title, fired two shots in the air.

The children’s mother, Toya Smith, said: ‘He bent down to give my son the belt and he almost fell over and dropped the belt, and he thought my baby dropped the belt.

‘He put (the gun) up against his (her husband’s) temple, I jumped in front of it and it went off up into the air.

‘He was going to shoot him, but I saw it, he was going to kill him and I had to hit the gun.’

The 36-year-old was due to defend his title against Sergio Mora on February 6 but that fight has been cancelled

The family attempted to leave but Taylor continued to point the gun in their direction.

‘He was pointing at the kids, so I jumped in front of him again and said, “please don’t shoot my kids,”’ Smith said.

Taylor was later arrested and found to have a gun and a small amount of marijuana in his possession.

He was charged with aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a minor and possession of the drug.

Taylor was due to make the first defence of his title against Sergio Mora on February 6 but that fight has been scrapped.

The 36-year-old is also due to face trial in June over the alleged shooting of his cousin last August.

Tyrone Hinton was shot multiple times and Taylor was charged with first-degree domestic assault and aggravated assault.
