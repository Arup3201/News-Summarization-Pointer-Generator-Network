It is the erotic novel that has housewives across the globe spluttering into their tea - and has sent sales of Kindles soaring 71 per cent.

EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey, dubbed 'Mummy porn' for its appeal to the average married mother, has reignited the trend for erotic fiction - and has got everyone, even fellow bonkbuster authors - talking.

Last week Jilly Cooper went on the record to say that whether EL James's trilogy was well-written or not was debatable - but what was certain was that the author had done writers like her a service by putting the bonkbuster back on the map.

Disappointed: Lace author Shirley Conran says 'Mummy porn' trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey is 'infantile'

And now, Shirley Conran, author behind Eighties erotic hit Lace, has joined the conversation, coming out to discuss the racy trilogy ahead of the re-release of her book this summer.

The 79-year-old author has hit out at the Fifty Shades trilogy, saying it does not deserve the moniker Mummy porn.

Instead, she says, the books are more worthy of the nickname 'baby porn', owing to the absence of any real boudoir action.

Speaking to The Times Magazine, Ms Conran was disdainful of the global bestseller, calling it 'infantile' and expressing her disappointment with how long it took before any real S&M was introduced.

'It's more like baby porn,' she said. 'You have to wait until page 200 for any sex at all. She doesn't get her bottom spanked until page 400.'

E. L. James nets herself £862,069 per week for the novel which has gripped the nation

Ms Conran also repeated a popular criticism of the trilogy, which Ms James initially published herself using Kindle's self-publication tool, saying that the prose was 'jerky' and needed 'a good edit'.

Of course, Ms Conran is not unaware that the success of Fifty Shades Of Grey has paved the way for the re-release of her own erotic works. 

But she has her own theory as to why the sadomasochistic theme of the Fifty Shades trilogy has so successfully captured the imagination of women today.

She thinks women are aroused by submission because 'so many women have experienced patriarchal violence from their fathers'.

'I certainly did,' she admits. 'Not that it made me find it erotic later in life.
