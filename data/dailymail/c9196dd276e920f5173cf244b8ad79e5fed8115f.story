Wayne Rooney has paid a fascinating and insightful tribute to his family — wife Coleen and sons Kai and Klay — after helped him celebrate the milestone of winning his 100th England cap.

Team Rooney were at Wembley to see Dad join the likes of Bobby Moore and David Beckham in the exclusive 100 club and he in turn has revealed for the first time the key role they play in his life and career.

Rooney, who will turn 30 next year, is a vastly different person from the callow youth who first appeared on television screens chewing gum when he picked up the BBC’s Young Sports Personality of the Year award in 2002.

He says daily games of football with his two boys in the back garden of their home in Cheshire is the one time he feels he can truly escape the pressures of being Wayne Rooney the superstar.

And Coleen, the childhood sweetheart he married in a glittering £5million ceremony in Italy, remains an important counsel when making the major decisions in his career, including the desire to carry on playing for England as long as they want him, as Beckham did.

Rooney says that it’s 18-month-old Klay — named in tribute to boxer Muhammad Ali, who was born Cassius Clay — who is presently showing more interest in football than five-year-old Kai.

‘I take them out into the garden most days and have a kickabout with the two of them. It’s my youngest lad who wants to stay there longer, he’s obsessed,’ says Rooney with a clear sense of pride.

‘They’re special moments for me because everywhere I go in the world there are photographers or fans coming up.

‘Once I go to my house – there’s very few people come to my house and I like that to stay private. That’s where I can be myself, a human being and a father rather than a footballer.

‘It would be nice if one of the boys wanted to be a footballer, but I have said before that it’s down to them and if they want to do it.

‘My eldest lad goes to football lessons but at the minute he’s not too interested in it. My youngest lad since the first day he could walk he’s been wanting a ball. He kicks a ball around everywhere he goes so they’re different characters.

Coleen Rooney was also at Wembley to see her husband claim his 100th international cap

‘I’ll be honest, I always thought you have to work at it being a footballer but I’ve now seen my youngest lad, without any teaching his technique is unbelievable. So I have started thinking you must be born with something. Then it’s obviously how you use it, how you work on it when you get older.’

While Klay may have inherited the football gene, Dad can already see Kai developing street-smarts.

‘He had his fifth birthday party and we had training and were going to stay at the hotel before the Man City game and I couldn’t go,’ says the Manchester United striker.

‘He’s in the same class as Robin van Persie’s daughter and I told my lad, “Sorry I can’t go, I’m playing football”. So he was testing me, saying, “Is Van Persie coming?” I said, “No, he’s at football with Daddy”. ‘He was testing me so he’s a lot cleverer than you think!’

Coleen, whom he met at school, is someone he confides in about big decisions. After the recent spate of international retirements by Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Rio Ferdinand, Rooney was interested to see what she thought about prolonging his international career when he approaches his mid-thirties.

England duty of course means reduced time with the family.

‘I spoke to my wife about it, I said it’s mad to see all the players are retiring. When you get to a certain age, you almost feel like you have to do it to extend your club career.

‘She was actually very good. She was the one who said to me, “It’s a short career, you have got plenty of time to have your time off with us as a family when you finish playing and you will regret it if you do”.

‘I obviously thought, “Yes, I would”. Football is what I love doing. Playing for my country I love. I don’t think I would ever walk away.’

Rooney has already targeted the 2018 World Cup and hopes he will still be good enough to be around for Euro 2020 when the final will be held at Wembley. If he achieves that, his appearance and goalscoring records for his country might take decades to be bettered: 150 caps and 75 goals look realistic targets.

Sir Alex Ferguson always maintained Rooney would have to work extra hard to stay at the top into his 30s because of his body shape.

The player accepts he will never have a physique like Cristiano Ronaldo but says it’s alarmist to think his career will flatline past 30.

‘I think when I first came into the professional game, a lot of people said my body shape won’t allow me to play for that long. But in some ways I feel it has helped me, because I am quite strong I haven’t picked up a lot of muscle injuries,’ he says.

‘They are the ones where you have seen players find it difficult to recover and be the same player, those who have hamstring injuries or thigh injuries.

‘I had a small injury in my groin last year but other than that all my injuries have been impact or a couple of cuts. I feel as fit as ever so I just have to keep working and make sure I am on top of that.

‘I don’t think I am a natural athlete when you look at some of the players’ physiques. But in terms of miles covered in training and on the pitch, I am always at the top so I think it doesn’t matter what you look like as a player physically.

‘Again, I think the next few years will be vital how I look after myself, how I do my training, that will determine how long I play on for.’

With Team Rooney — wife and boys — alongside him every step of the way.
