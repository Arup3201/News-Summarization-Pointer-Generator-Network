Speaker John Bercow tried to humiliate David Cameron in the Commons today by cutting him off mid-sentence.

During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs and interrupted by Mr Bercow.

As the PM tried to protest that he had not finished, the Speaker hit back: 'He can take it from me that he is finished.'

Speaker John Bercow slapped down the Prime Minister, cutting of his joke and telling he had finished before moving on to other business

Mr Bercow has been embroiled in a long-running feud with senior Tories who object to his attitude when chairing debates

The extraordinary slapdown from the Speaker marks a new low in relations between the two men, who have often clashed in the Commons.

Senior Tories also accuse Mr Bercow of using obscure parliamentary tactics to embarrass the party and foster rebellion.

During Prime Minister's Questions, the Speaker called 'order!' several times as the heckling drowned out exchanges at the Despatch Box.

Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband clashed over the government's handling of the Royal Mail privatisation.

David Cameron protested that he had not finished speaking, before being interrupted by Mr Bercow

But as the PM went on the attack, accusing Labour of failing to acknowledge economic growth and joking about Mr Miliband;s new election guru David Axelrod.

Mr Bercow rose to his feet and called out: 'Order! Order!'

Mr Cameron protested: 'But I haven't finished.' He won loud, sustained cheers from his Tory benches for the put-down.

But in an attempt to restore order, Mr Bercow said: 'In response to that question, the Prime Minister has finished and he can take it from me that he is finished.'

Mr Cameron totally ignored the Speaker and buried his head in a folder of paperwork.

In recent weeks Tory ministers have 
also begun to suspect Mr Bercow is using his powers as Speaker to cause 
trouble for the government.

They complain that amendments to legislation
 are called against standard convention, or the timing of debates and 
votes are co-ordinated to maximise embarrassment for Mr Cameron's administration.

'What he is doing with the procedures of the House is far more worrying that outbursts during PMQs,' a Tory minister said.

Today's episode is just the latest in a long-running saga between Mr Bercow and senior Tories.

Last
 year relations reached such a low that MPs designed badges with three 
bees pictured, to show they were members of the BBB club: ‘Bol****ed By 
Bercow’.

They included Iain Liddell-Grainger, the 
mild-mannered Bridgwater and West Somerset MP, who was wrongly accused on heckling at a Labour MP.

Mr Bercow yelled: ‘Be quiet, and if 
you cannot be quiet, get out. You are adding nothing, and you are 
subtracting a lot. It is rude, it is stupid, it is pompous and it needs 
to stop.’

But to the Speaker’s embarrassment, 
Tory Minister Alan Duncan admitted that he was the heckler, with Mr 
Liddell-Grainger the innocent party.

Anna Soubry, now a defence minister, was 
attacked three times by the Speaker, who declared that she ‘thinks her 
views are relevant, but we are not interested’.

Mr Bercow also issued an 
extraordinary rebuke of respected Defence Secretary Philip Hammond over 
his handling of a Commons statement on the Territorial Army, accusing 
him of being ‘utterly incompetent’ and ‘woefully inadequate’ and giving a
 strong suggestion that he considered him a bore.
