This grainy image shows the terrifying moment a gunman fired his weapon at a house in a quiet residential street.

The shooting occurred during a vicious, eight-month vendetta waged by gypsy crimelord Eugene Price, 34, and his family against a rival clan in St Helen's, Merseyside.

In another incident, Price's hitmen shot at a caravan as two small children slept inside, and there were four firebomb attacks against the Maughan family which brought 'fear and misery' to the streets of the town, a court heard.

Today Price, who made an estimated 
£1million a year from organised crime rackets, was jailed for 25 years 
after admitting a string of offences including conspiracy to possess a firearm with
intent to endanger life.

Inquiries revealed Price ran a busy drugs store in the town which had over 100 visits from addicts every day, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

Police surveillance showed in one week in April last year in which more than £14,000-worth of Class A drugs including cocaine and heroin were sold from the house.

But Price and his gang were rounded up during a major crackdown on organised crime after his hitman, David Doolan, 28, was bugged by police and was caught boasting and laughing about his roles in the shootings.

Details emerged at Liverpool Crown Court as Price, from Leeds, was jailed for 25 years after he conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, conspiracy to commit arson and possess a firearm with intent to endanger life.

The court heard shots were fired at 
two properties belonging to members of the Maughan family in February last year.

During the attack on the caravan, a shotgun was fired through the 
window where a five-year-old boy lay sleeping child underneath and his 
eight-year-old sister lay asleep nearby.

Pellets from the gun covered the 
five-year-old boy but he escaped injury. No-one was injured during the 
attack on the house although a window and door were damaged.

Prosecutor David Birrell said the scale of Price’s drugs operation was 'frankly enormous.'

Passing sentence, Judge Dennis 
Watson QC told Price and his accomplices: 'Against a background of 
extremely serious inter-gang violence, you would seek out the homes of 
your rivals and discharge firearms.'

'You were all involved in a very well
organised retailing operation which was responsible for putting huge 
quantities of Class A drugs onto the streets of St Helens.

'Class A drugs such as heroin and 
cocaine wreck lives, fuel crime, break up families and cause death. You 
were all well aware of the misery you were peddling and it’s worthy of 
note that since all of you were arrested the general level of crime in 
St Helens, I’m told, has fallen significantly.'

Doolan, from Bootle, Liverpool, was jailed for 18 years for conspiracy to supply drugs, to commit arson, and to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life.

A third leading gang member Christopher Lunt, 27, of Wigan, was jailed for 21 and a half years for the same offences, and five other members of the crime family were jailed for a total of 34 years.

Since the police swoop, crime levels in 
the town have dropped and residents say the streets are
much 'quieter and safer', the court heard.

Today Detective Superintendent Richie Salter of Merseyside Police said: 'These people had access to firearms and were not afraid to use them. They had a complete disregard for the safety and lives of others.

'At the time of the shooting on the caravan a five-year-old child was asleep on the bed. We are so fortunate that the child, or others who were in the caravan, were not seriously injured or killed.

'When you look at the photographs, it really brings home the complete disregard that these people have for the lives of others.'

Five other people were convicted of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.  Christopher Kendall, 29, of Wigan, was jailed for 13 years; Norman Worrall, 58, of Bootle, Liverpool was jailed for six years; Debbie Ballard, 43, of St Helens, was jailed for five years four months; Stephen Finney, 21, of St Helens, was jailed for five years; and Mark Jervis, 32, of St Helens, was jailed for four years.
