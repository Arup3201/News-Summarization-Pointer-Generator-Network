Roberto Martinez has hailed chairman Bill Kenwright as the Spaniard bids to take Everton to a Champions League place this season.

Martinez had a successful first season in charge at Goodison Park as he led Everton to fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a Champions League place.

And Martinez is confident the club will move forward again this season thanks to the work done during the  summer by Kenwright and the board in strengthening the squad.

Martinez told ESPNFC.com: 'Everyone can see what we did last season. We brought a lot of hope, togetherness and positivity to the club.

'We had a very tough task to try to assemble a squad that could carry that on for the next season, but what the chairman and the board have done this summer is incredible.

'The signing of Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry as a permanent player, the new contracts of John Stones, Ross Barkley and Seamus Coleman, it's a real sign that we're going forward.'

Everton face a tough test this weekend as they host Arsenal at Goodison Park in the evening kick-off on Saturday.
