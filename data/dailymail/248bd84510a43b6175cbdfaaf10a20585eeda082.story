Peter Quinn was jailed for ten years after he attempted to rape two teenage girls in a graveyard

A sex-attacker who told his two teenage victims that he gets turned on when a woman tells him she doesn't want it has been jailed for ten years. 

Peter Quinn, 23, pounced on his victims and dragged them into a graveyard on their way home from a Halloween party.

The attacker from Swindon, Wiltshire told one of the girls to perform a sex act on him or he would rape her friend. 

Luckily, one of the girls was able to break free and ran away screaming 'rape' before dialing 999. 

Both of the 19-year-old girls were wearing fancy dress when they were attacked.

A passer-by saw Quinn and chased him off following the 4am attack. 

The girls were interviewed by police how gave them an e-fit description. Quinn was arrested as a result of the tattack. 

Quinn initially denied the horrific attack, but forensic evidence - a pubic hair recovered from one of the victim's breasts - came back as a match and he pleaded guilty at Swindon Crown Court.

The court heard the attack, on November 1, 2014, in Swindon Town Centre left the girls severely traumatised, with one suffering reoccurring nightmares.

Hannah Squire, prosecuting, said: 'This was a terrifying attack on two young women late at night. It was prolonged and would have left them traumatised.'

The court heard Quinn ran up behind the girls shouting 'Wey hay', but they thought nothing of it and dismissed him as another Hallowe'en reveller.

But he grabbed both girls and dragged them into the graveyard where he exposed himself and pushed private parts into one of the victim's face while fondling breasts of the other.

Quinn demanded each carry out sex acts on him telling them he would rape her friend if they refused saying 'When a woman doesn't want it, it turns me on'.

One of the girls managed to dial 999 saying 'Hello, police. Faringdon Park,' before Quinn knocked the handset from her grasp, before he fled the scene.

Quinn, of Swindon, Wiltshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted rape and one of sexual assault.

Judge Tim Mousley QC in sentencing said: 'What you did to them was the sort of offence that, mercifully, rarely comes before the courts.

Sentencing Quinn at Swindon Crown Court, pictured, Judge Tim Mousley said the women had been subjected to a 'living nightmare' and praised them claiming they showed 'enormous courage in resiisting him. 

'You created a living nightmare for these two young women which they still experience in nearly every aspect of their young lives and will continue to do so for perhaps the rest of their lives.

'One can only hope that the impact upon them will decrease over the years. These were sustained assaults on two young vulnerable women, significantly younger than yourself.

'I am satisfied that you were determined to force yourself fully on either or both of them in that church yard that night and what you did was accompanied by your making the most frightening threats to them.

'They showed enormous courage in resisting you. It was only as a result of that that you were prevented from reaching your wicked aims.'

He sentenced Quinn to ten years in prison with a five year extended licence meaning he must register as a sex offender for life.
