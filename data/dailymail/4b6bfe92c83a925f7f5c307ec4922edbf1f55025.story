Chelsea will look to secure the long-term future of Thibaut Courtois this month, with the club eager to conclude discussions over a new contract.

The Stamford Bridge club want to follow up the news that key defender Cesar Azpilicueta has signed a new five-year deal by announcing an extension for Courtois.

The Belgian's contract still has two years left to run but talks over a new five-year deal have been ongoing for several weeks.

Courtois has been installed as the club's new first choice goalkeeper following his return from a successful loan spell at Atletico Madrid.

And the Blues believe they are close to an agreement with Courtois over a new deal, that will see him net a sharp increase on his current £30,000-per-week deal.

Courtois had been stalling on penning fresh terms until manager Jose Mourinho had made his decision about who would be his No. 1 this season.

Despite losing his status as the club's first choice keeper, Petr Cech rejected the chance to move in the transfer window to fight for his place.

Moving aside: Petr Cech has been dislodged as Chelsea's No 1 by Courtois after years of dominance
