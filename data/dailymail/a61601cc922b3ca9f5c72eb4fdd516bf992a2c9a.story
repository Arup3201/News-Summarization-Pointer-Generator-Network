House prices have leapt almost £500 a month this summer as the market continues to recover and government attempts to kickstart mortgage lending enabled more first-time buyers to get a foot on the property ladder.

The average price for a UK home now stands at £170,514, a rise of 3.5 per cent from last August, according to Nationwide building society.

In addition, mortage lending is at its highest for more than five years, according to Bank of England figures. Experts say a 'rising tide' of lending is boosting the property market.

Rising higher: House prices continued to rise on a quarterly basis, suggesting a continuing strengthening in the market

Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy have boosted the market by helping first-time buyers, in particular, on to the property ladder, enabling the market to avoid the traditional summer lull.

The £80bn Funding for Lending Scheme 
launched in August 2012 offers banks and building societies discounted 
loans in return for pledges to lend to businesses and households. 

Initiative: Chancellor George Osborne's Funding for Lending and Help to Buy schemes have been credited with keeping the housing market lively during the normally sleepier summer months

It has been credited with improving the availability of mortgages and reducing interest rates. 

Chancellor George Osborne also launched Help to Buy in April, which allows people to buy a property with a 5 per cent deposit.

The state lends buyers 20 per cent of the value of a new home worth up to £600,000, interest-free for five years.

Figures from the Bank of England showed that mortgage approvals climbed to 60,624 last month, up from 58,238 in June. This marks the highest level since March 2008.

Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders recently showed that first-time buyers accounted for 45 per cent of house purchase loans between April and June - the highest since records began in 2005.

Nationwide said house prices rises had shot up 1.4 per cent in the three months to August - the strongest pace of increase since mid-2010.

The building society said this rise was evidence of the growing robustness of the property market.

Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of Dragonfly Property Finance, said: ‘While the Nationwide's figures are stronger than the Land Registry's, also published this week, what's not in doubt is that prices, overall, are rising.'

Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, told the Daily Express: 'The housing market is being lifted by a rising tide of mortgage lending. House purchase lending is 30 per cent higher than last July, which reflects the drastic improvement in the availability of high loan-to-value mortgages.' 

On the up: House prices have been rising steadily this year with the average UK house price at a three-year high

Mr Sexton said the mortgage market was now much more accessible to first-time buyers, which had triggered 'a ripple of activity all the way up the ladder'.

He added that the choice of mortgages available to borrowers was at its highest since the financial crisis, which had opened up the market to a much wider spectrum of people.

Some property experts suggested that the surge in house purchases in what is traditionally a quieter month for the market could be partly down to buyers rushing to get on to the property ladder before prices rise any further.

Boost: The number of first-time buyers entering the property market has leapt to levels not seen in nearly ten years since the launch of the Help to Buy scheme

But there are concerns that these schemes will push up house prices and borrowing levels, rather than spurring on more new home construction.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned earlier this week over the risks of another housing bubble. He said the Bank is ‘acutely aware’ of the potential threats and said action will be taken to clamp down on mortgage lending if needed.

The Bank could step in and ask lenders to restrict borrowing terms or even force banks to hold more cash on their balance sheets to slow down price rises.

Steep gains: The percentage rise in the average house price since last summer has been steep, illustrating the effect of government efforts to unblock mortgage lending

Earlier this week mortgage industry professionals joined mounting criticism of George Osborne's subsidies aimed first-time buyers, as a survey found most of them expected property values to surge by 11 per cent by 2016.

The Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association found 60 per cent of lenders and mortgage advisers feared a house price bubble.

Lenders are already forecasting the average house price will rise by 2.7 per cent by the end of this year, based on Land Registry data of sales in the first half of 2013.

Peter Williams, executive director of IMLA, warned the Government might end up giving with one hand and taking away with the other.

He warned the Government’s exit from the scheme would also need to be managed very carefully on order to avoid doing serious harm to levels of mortgage lending and said more needed to be done to build more homes in order to meet demand and prevent another bubble.

‘If people are struggling to raise deposits in the current climate, then a further 11 per cent increase in house prices will lift the property ladder even further out of reach for some.

Affordability fear: But house the average house price to earnings ratio has also been creeping up in recent months, meaning the property ladder will remain out of reach for many

Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ‘While there have been encouraging signs that house building is starting to recover, construction is still running well below what is likely to be required to keep up with demand.'

He added: ‘The risk is that if demand continues to run ahead of supply, affordability may become stretched.’

Property experts said the growth in house prices was expected but also warned the figures masked contrasting regional variations.

Mr Samuels said that while demand was rising steadily, buyers were becoming much more wary about paying over the odds for a property, and that the recovery of the housing market was patchy across the country.

‘As ever, it's important to remember that the average house price figure glosses over areas of the country where the market is less robust,' he added.

‘London and the South East may be steaming ahead but other areas, especially in the North, are still spluttering their way to recovery.’

House prices have risen by 6.3 per cent in London over the past year, figures revealed yesterday.

But they were falling or stalling in the rest of the country, according to data released by the Land Registry – highlighting the gulf in Britain’s property market.

While the cost of the average home in London has reached an all-time high of £385,800, in other parts of the country house prices are £30,000 below their peak.

Wales experienced the biggest fall, with prices down 2.2 per cent in the past year to an average of £115,149. In the North East, the average house price is only £99,718.

Even in the regions where they are rising, the increases were only modest – 0.5 per cent in the East Midlands, 1.3 per cent in the East and 1 per cent in the South West. The average price of a home in England and Wales is £164,098, up only 0.8 per cent in the past year.

The Land Registry said the number of homes sold for £1million or more has risen by 28 per cent in the past year, to 24 a day. The total in May was 740 – 508 of which were in London.
