She may have just hit the big 4-0 but Kate Moss isn't letting her age get in the way of her career.

The supermodel - who this month celebrated her milestone birthday with an epic week-long celebration - has been unveiled as the face of Alexander McQueen's SS14 campaign.

Shot by renowned photographer Steven Klein on location in East London, the campaign aims to 'capture the iconic British model as an otherworldly woman in a darkly surreal environment', according to the fashion house.

Donning a leather bra and matching pleated skirt, Kate, who rocks a bright blonde pixie crop, bares an uncanny resemblance to actress Tilda Swinton.  

Both Klein and Moss are long-time collaborators of the house and to accompany the campaign imagery, Klein also produced a film starring the model.

Avant-garde: Moss was a close friend of quintessentially quirky British designer McQueen

Klein was inspired by the 1960s British thriller, Peeping Tom, which sees a serial killer murder women and then record their dying expressions on camera.

The eerie campaign also sees Kate pose with a mini doll version of herself, donning the same Sarah Burton-designed outfit.

Moss was a close friend of avant-garde and quintessentially quirky British designer McQueen, who sadly passed away in February 2010.

Although she walked on the McQueen catwalk as a hologram in 2006, this is her first campaign for the fashion house.

This isn't Kate's only campaign of 2014 - she also recently smouldered in a Rimmel campaign, as well as the pre-SS14campaign for Liu J.

The supermodel celebrated her milestone birthday last fortnight with cocktails and champagne at the exclusive 34 restaurant in London's Mayfair alongside Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney, Nick Grimshaw, fashion designer John Galliano, and photographer Mario Testino.

Kate then moved the party out of 
London, speeding away from the capital with her husband Jamie Hince in 
the £20,000 vintage Porsche Carrera that had been given to the model as a
 40th birthday present by billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green.

Guests arrived at the model’s £2m, 
ten-bedroom Cotswold home on Saturday, to continue the celebrations that
had started on Thursday afternoon at 4pm.

The
 last survivors of her mammoth four-day party left the star’s country 
home last night, following a Glastonbury-themed bash that was expected 
to have cost the star more than £100,000.
