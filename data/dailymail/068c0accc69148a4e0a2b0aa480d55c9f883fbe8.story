Alison Russell is the first ever judge to be allowed to use the title Ms

A senior judge has been allowed to take a feminist title for the first time.

Newly-appointed High Court judge Alison Russell will be known on the bench as Ms Justice Russell, it was confirmed yesterday.

A spokesman for the judiciary said that the judge, known as Alison Russell QC until her elevation to the High Court, had asked for the title and it had been approved as ‘official nomenclature’.

The decision to allow a judge to be addressed that way was taken by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Sir James Munby, the judge who heads the family courts where 55-year-old Ms Justice Russell will operate.

It is a departure from past practice, in which women judges were not permitted to deviate from established forms of address.

After Elizabeth Butler-Sloss became the first female Appeal judge in 1988 she was forced to accept the title set down in law. As a result for six years she presided over cases as Lord Justice Butler-Sloss.

There were signs yesterday that judicial staff remain slow to adjust to the new form of address.

An official announcement calls the new judge Ms. Russell, complete with full stop, and then goes on to refer to her as Miss Russell when describing her career.

Ms Russell, born in Harrogate to a Scottish family, was public school educated at Wellington but then, unusually for a successful lawyer, took a degree not at an ancient university but at the then South Bank Polytechnic.

She became a barrister, specialising in human rights and family law, shorly after leaving college. She was a Queen’s Counsel by 2008 and a Deputy High Court judge in 2011.

The judge, who has no children, is unmarried and lives with her partner Julian Francis in Brixton in South London.

She describes her interests as Spain, Handel, cooking, reading, and playing with her niece and nephews.
