Britain has threatened an immediate break in intelligence sharing with Germany if it continues to insist on airing secret GCHQ documents in public, it has been claimed.

A German magazine claims a crisis meeting was held in Berlin this week to discuss the biggest rift between secret services since the end of WW2.

America, which operates closely with Britain, has threatened the same boycott which will essentially strip Germany of the protection of the two best intelligence agencies in the world.

Focus Magazine, known for its strong links with the BND, the German equivalent of MI6, reveals details of the 'deep partnership crisis' in its forthcoming issue to be published on Saturday.

A senior security source told the magazine: 'Without the information supplied by Anglo-Americans, we will be blind.'

It would mean high-grade information on jihadists, their movements and terror plans as discovered by London and Washington and directly involving Germany, would cease immediately to be passed on.

The upheaval has been caused by left-wing and green politicians still fuming over the spying activities carried out in Germany by America's National Security Agency, which allegedly involved the eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel's personal mobile telephone.

It hinges on a German government request asking Britain to release details of secret operations in Germany to its committee currently probing NSA and other foreign spy agency activities in the country.

The move was forced by politicians of the hard-left Die Linke and the environmentalist Green parties, and the official Berlin letter seeking documents was sent to British intelligence a little over a week ago.

Both Britain and America are fuming. Both have refused to send any of the requested files to Germany. Included among them was a demand for information about a 2013 operation handled by both countries - and in co-operation with the BND - which was, and remains, top secret but was known to involve a massive surveillance programme on suspected Islamic terrorists across Europe.

Britain fears a 'big debate' in the German parliament which would lay open secret sources and intelligence gathering techniques.

'Never has a friendly nation been asked to divulge its secrets in this way,' said one BND source. 'It is outrageous and we completely understand the fury that this has unleashed in Whitehall.

'The British have a horror of secrets being revealed. If they and the Americans withdraw co-operation, it would be catastrophic for Germany.

It would brand Germany among the community of nations as a country not to be trusted to share intelligence aimed at combatting terror and spying by hostile governments. It would make us a pariah.'

Gerhard Schindler, the president of the BND, met politicians concerned with the enquiry on Wednesday to ask them to drop the demand for British intelligence documents. Chancellor Merkel is known to be angry herself at the high-handed stance of the left and greens but is treading a fine line in a country where many citizens remain outraged at the extent of foreign intelligence snooping in their country.

Britain has no intention of releasing one single classified document to the Germans but is threatening the breach nonethless should the demand for them continue. German confirmed the meeting on Wednesday between Schindler and lawmakers but had no further comment on 'security matters.'
