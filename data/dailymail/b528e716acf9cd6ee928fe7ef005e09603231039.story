Holidaymakers in their hordes were left frustrated this summer, with as many as one in five flights from the UK delayed, according to new figures.

Departures from Gatwick to Spain the were worst affected, with flights from the airport to Barcelona registering the highest number of UK flights with a delay of more than three hours.

For flights delayed by more than three hours, the average delay was four hours 42 minutes, the figures from flightright.co.uk reveal.

In total, about 161,570 of the 752,000 flights that passed through UK airports this summer were delayed

According to the statistics,  161,570 of the estimated 752,000 flights that passed through UK airports this summer were delayed, representing 21 per cent of all flights.

This was a 10 per cent uplift in the number of delays on last year.

The results indicate that about 397,000 UK air passengers are entitled to more than £128m in untapped compensation for flights delayed or cancelled over the June to August period.

The five routes from UK airports to European destinations which registered the most flights with a delay of more than three hours were Gatwick to Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Faro and Malaga, as well as Manchester airport to Malaga.

While routes with the most reported cancellations were London City to Paris Orly and Zurich and Heathrow to Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Amsterdam Schipol.

Flights from Gatwick to Barcelona had the highest number of flights with delays of more than three hours

Marek Janetzke, Managing Director of flightright, said: 'UK passengers have up to six years to make a claim compensation so it's not too late to claim for flight delays over the summer. 

'Often people are unaware that it only takes a three-hour delay to be eligible for compensation of around £200. 

'Potential compensation can reach up to £475 per passenger depending on the flight distance and delay time.

'Unfortunately most passengers do not know about their rights. 

'Airlines mostly leave them without any information about it or even negate that their customers are entitled to compensation.'

The figures are based on a flightright evaluation of flights between June and August 2014 and the same period in 2013.
