Wearing a new range of lingerie for curvier women, Ashley James  is back fronting a line of bras for women with bigger breasts.

The 30F-cup star, who made her name on Made In Chelsea, is the face of Tutti Rouge for SS15 and AW15, as revealed in these new images.

Ashley, 26, has an established career in modelling, TV presenting and fashion design, and also launched her own jewellery line in 2014, called Whistle & Bango.

And the gorgeous blonde is back showcasing her incredible figure posing in lingerie crafted for curvier women.

The slender star carries off the latest fashions just like a catwalk model.

With sizes going from a 28-38 D-J - and everything in between - Tutti are competing with the likes of Freya and Panache in the big boobs market.

'We are delighted that Ashley James is the face of Tutti Rouge,' says Jessica Prebble, creative director of Tutti Rouge.

Each season Tutti Rouge bring out a daytime, evening, mid-week date-night and weekend party collection. 

The SS15 collection, which has just gone on sale, is inspired by the feel of the Fifties, milkshakes and marabou with headscarves and heels.

Old faithful shapes come in a new cocktail of sorbet shades. 

The sassy Janey style comes in a tropical burst of colours, great for brightening up any summer outfit.

Liliana, meanwhile, is perfect for everyday, coming in at £26 for the bra and £12.50 for the co-ordinates.

Nichole, a sexy yet supportive collection, is great for a mid-week date with the girls or the apple of your eye. The  stylish collection is finished with a leopard print bow.

Looking ahead, FEMAIL has a sneak peek of the AW15 catalogue.

The so-called Kiss and Tell collection is inspired by 'the charming temptation of frivolous fun, the divine state of mind after a lingering kiss and the thrill of the chase'. 

Ashley James says: 'As a curvy girl I just love working with a brand who offers fun and flirty lingerie in big cups and small back sizes. 

'Personally, I think the Kiss and Tell collection is the prettiest yet, a fabulous mix of colour, tones and signature Tutti finishes like love hearts and bows! I also enjoyed working with my dog on his modeling debut!'

Jewel tones lead the way in this tale of two hearts, serenaded by tempting lace trims and finished with bountiful bows. 

The Betty balconette bra style returns for AW15, Flirt with bold hand sketched roses in beautiful pink hues contrasted by teal leaves. The uplifting style is trimmed with adorable pink organza frills, bows and a sparkling pink diamante, available in sizes 28-38' D-HH cup.

Tutti Rouge is available to buy on the Big Cartel, ASOS Marketplace, Lace Lingerie, Bravissimo and independent lingerie boutiques.
