Questioned: Morrissey has revealed that he was quizzed by Scotland Yard over his controversial 1980s song Margaret on the Guillotine

Famously private singer Morrissey has revealed that he was quizzed by Scotland Yard over his controversial 1980s song Margaret on the Guillotine.

The ex-Smiths star was 'cross-examined' by the force's Special Branch after the song appeared on his debut solo album Viva Hate.

It describes Margaret Thatcher's death as a 'wonderful dream' - with lyrics such as 'People like you make me so tired' and 'When will you die?'

The 54-year-old musician, who made the revelation in a new autobiography, was 'cross-examined' to determine whether he posed a threat to the then-Prime Minister, according to The Telegraph.

His memoir, simply named Autobiography, also discloses details of how his first relationship with a man came in his 30s and how he later discussed becoming a father with a close female companion.

Other revelations in the book include Morrissey's experience of being touched by a male teacher in his early teens, his offers of acting roles in EastEnders and Emmerdale and his brush with numerous famous faces.

The star revealed he was in his mid-30s when he met Jake Walters at a dinner in Notting Hill.

'Jake and I fell together in deep collusion whereby the thorough and personal could be the only possible way and we ate up each minute of the day,' he said.

'There will be no secrets of flesh or fantasy; he is me and I am he.

'We managed to parrot on non-stop for two years in a jocular fourth-form stew of genius and silliness.'

Concern: The 54-year-old musician, who made the revelation in a new autobiography, was 'cross-examined' by the force's Special Branch to determine whether he posed a threat to then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

The singer's 457-page book, which is not divided into chapters, was published at his insistence as a Penguin Classic.

This sparked concern among readers and authors alike - with some arguing that the imprint was straying from its typically historically significant work, such as that of Homer, Dickens and Virgil.

In the book, Morrissey discusses an incident with a male teacher in his teenage years.

He revealed the member of staff took an interest in him - eyeing him up and massaging his hurt wrist with 'slow and sensual strokes'.

He also talks about his strong attachment to Iranian-born friend Tina Dehghani, whom he met while living in Los Angeles.

The kind people

Have a wonderful dream

Margaret on the guillotine

Cause people like you

Make me feel so tired

When will you die ?

When will you die ?

When will you die ?

When will you die ?

When will you die ?

And people like you

Make me feel so old inside

Please die

And kind people

Do not shelter this dream

Make it real

Make the dream real

Make the dream real

Make it real

Make the dream real

Make it real

'Tina is my first experience of uncluttered commitment,' he wrote. 'We take our place together almost without noticing.'

Unsurprisingly, the singer's writing is as scabrous as the interviews he has given over the past three decades.

He calls his colleague Mike Joyce a 'pounder drummer' when discussing what he thought were the injustices of a lengthy court case in which Joyce and bass player Andy Rourke sought a 25 per cent share of the band's earnings.

And he refers to his ex-songwriting partner and guitarist Johnny Marr 'a virtuoso of to-ing and gro-ing, you might swear that you are in the company of identical triplets as Johnny stands before you'.

Morrissey provides a forensic analysis of the court case - which he and fellow songwriter Marr lost - over many pages as he takes apart the witnesses, the lawyers and the judge.

And he complains about the decision to increase the share of profits afforded to bandmates Joyce and Rourke, which was upheld on appeal. 

He is particularly venomous about Joyce's extensive legal claims on his royalties claiming he 'grabs all he can', taking '£3 million - or thereabouts' of Morrissey's royalties under a later Smiths deal with Warner Records, which the singer called 'a farce of unimaginable proportions'.

The star also talks of his unhappiness with Geoff Travis, the man who signed them to his record label Rough Trade, even though he had not been interested in hearing their demo until Marr insisted.

He claims they were poorly treated by Travis, despite the label's success being built on The Smiths.

'There will never be one instance in the Smiths' history with Rough Trade when Geoff would treat the band to a lavish none-too-cheap dinner or salutary clink of earthenware,' he wrote.

Morrissey also revealed that he was offered acting roles on popular TV soaps Emmerdale and EastEnders - and could have appeared as the son of Dot Cotton.

Despite shedding little light on the mysterious break-up of The Smiths in 1987, Morrissey discloses that he and Marr were 'both drained beyond belief' - adding 'there was no-one around us to suggest that we disappear somewhere to rest, and apart.'

He also revealed the guitarist told him at one stage he was ready to reform The Smiths.

However, Morrissey dismissed such a move, saying 'Surviving The Smiths is not something that should be attempted twice.'
