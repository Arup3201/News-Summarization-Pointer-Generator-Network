He is a tireless green campaigner and quick to criticise anything which is harmful to the environment.

But it seems millionaire Tory MP Zac Goldsmith is happy to let his own car burn a little extra fuel.

For the environmentalist has been banned from driving and ordered to pay £570 after getting three speeding tickets in as many months last winter.

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, he son of the billionaire Sir James, has been banned from driving after clocking up three speeding offences

The 39-year-old was caught breaking the  limit in his hybrid Toyota Prius – the green driver’s car of choice – in the same location in Hammersmith, West London, on two consecutive days last December.

According to prosecutors he was captured by a speed camera travelling at 38mph in the 30mph zone on December 4, then at 36mph on December 5. He was then caught speeding again in his own constituency of Richmond Park in South West London in February, driving at 39mph in a 30mph zone.

As the son of billionaire banker Sir James Goldsmith already had points on his licence, he was last week fined and disqualified from driving for six months, after pleading guilty at Lavender Hill Magistrates’ Court.

Goldsmith, who didn’t appear in court for the judgment, was originally scheduled to be sentenced yesterday but the date was brought forward for an undisclosed reason.

Goldsmith was handed a £155 fine and a two month ban for his offence in Hammersmith Road, west London

In February, Goldsmith was flashed by a speed camera breaking the limit in Lower Mortlake Road in Richmond

Court official Nicola Kedney said: ‘Mr Goldsmith had three cases dealt with on July 23.  The first speeding offence heard was committed on February 20 this year in Richmond.

He had exceeded 30mph on Lower Mortlake Road, a restricted road, while driving a Toyota. He got a £155 fine and was disqualified for two months.

‘For a speeding offence on December 5 last year on Hammersmith Road again he got another £155 fine and a two-month ban.

‘The third offence was for speeding the day before, December 4, on the same road. He was driving the same Toyota over 30mph in a restricted road.

‘He got a £155 fine, had to pay a £20 victim surcharge and was ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs. His licence was endorsed with three penalty points and he was disqualified for six months. The disqualifications will run concurrently, with the total ban lasting six months.’

Philip Goose, of road safety charity Brake, said: ‘Speed limits exist for one simple reason: they save lives.

‘Regardless of whether you are somebody with responsibility for deciding the laws on our roads or not, drivers should take personal responsibility for their actions and stick well within the limit.’

Yesterday, the housekeeper at Goldsmith’s home by the exclusive Richmond Park said he was on holiday in the countryside and wouldn’t be returning for a few days.
