These fascinating portraits are believed to be the only surviving images of French veterans who fought in the Napoleonic Wars of 1803–1815 wearing the uniforms they fought in.

The former soldiers, aged in their 70s and 80s, were believed to have been photographed in the 1850s in Paris.

The blurring on some of the pictures shows how hard the ageing subjects found it to stand still for several seconds while the plates were exposed.

One of the stills shows the tall Sergeant Taria striking an elegant pose in the uniform of a Grenadier of The Imperial Guard, a small group of elite soldiers of the French Army under the direct command of Napoleon.

Monsieur Ducel, a Mameluke (cavalry squadron) of the Imperial Guard, who fought between 1813 and 1815 also cuts an imposing figure.

One old veteran, Monsieur Loria of the 24th Mounted Chasseur Regiment and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, appears to have lost his right eye.

Holding a plumed shako (a tall, cylindrical military cap) in his right hand is M. Dreuse of the 2nd Light Horse Lancers of the Guard, circa 1813-14.

Pictured in his grand hussar uniform is Monsieur Moret of the 2nd Regiment, 1814-1815 (left) and Monsieur Mauban of the 8th Dragoon Regiment of 1815

When and why these men were photographed is a mystery, but some clues are offered in Henri Bouchot's book L'Epopée du Costume Militaire Français, published in Paris in 1898, and containing pictures by the famous French military illustrator, Job.

There is a colour plate with a transparent overlay bearing the titled 'Les Vieux de la vieille, Le 5 Mai, 1855'.

It depicts 10 Napoleonic veterans in their full uniforms passing the column in the centre of the Place Vendôme erected by Napoleon to commemorate the battle of Austerlitz.

The individuals in the photographs match up well with the figures crossing the square.

The date of the event, May 5, provides the reason why these men were in Paris - it was the anniversary of the death of Napoleon and every year on that date veterans gathered in the capital.

The Times of London in May 1855 noted: 'The base and railings of the column of the Place Vendôme appear this day decked out with the annual offerings to the memory of the man whose statue adorns the summit.

'The display of garlands of immortelles, and other tributes of the kind, is greater than usual...the old soldiers of the Empire performed their usual homage yesterday at the same place.'

A more likely date however, is May 5, 1858, because all the veterans are wearing the Saint Helene medal which had been issued on August 12, 1857, to all veterans of the wars of the French Revolution and the Empire.

Napoleon's armies conquered much of Europe but French dominion collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812.

Napoleon was defeated in 1814 by the 'Sixth Coalition' of Austria, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and a number of German States.

He was exiled but returned and was finally defeated in 1815 at Waterloo. All of France's territorial gains were taken away by the victors.

‘I no longer regarded myself as a simple general,’ Napoleon once said, ‘but as a man called upon to decide the fate of peoples.’

He died in may 1821 as a prisoner of the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.
