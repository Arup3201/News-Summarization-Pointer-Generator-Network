Fashion designer Kenneth Cole has broken the Guinness Record for the World's Largest Replica High Heel shoe after creating a 73 inch model of his brand's popular $225 Otto heel. 

The 60-year-old fashion veteran was enlisted by Today show correspondent Jill Martin, who earlier this year confessed that breaking a world record was on her bucket list. 

'After I listed 'I want to break a world record' on my bucket list, I search the Guinness World record site, to see what record I could possibly break,' Jill, 38, said on the show. 

'You know, I'm not the tallest person, I'm not the shortest person, I don't have the longest finger nails - but I do know shoes.

'So I needed to find a shoe to replicate and I thought "who is quirky and cool enough to want this title?"'

Kenneth and Jill called on the services of Izquierdo Studio, a custom costumes and props company, who offered to help them turn their lofty shoe dreams into a reality. 

'Footwear in and of itself might be one of the most difficult products to bring to market because it's not just about designing,' Kenneth told the New York Post. 

'It's about engineering and it's about sculpting, and ultimately it has to be a perfect proportion in order for it to fit and hold the weight of its inhabiter. And then to take it and change its scale is an even greater feat.'

Kenneth and Jill's mammoth Otto replica, which was verified by an official Guinness Record Adjudicator on Thursday, trampled all over the former record, which was set in 1996 by Edmund Kryza of Poland with a replica pump measuring 44 inches high and 72 inches long.

But it wasn't an easy feat finding enough materials to create the statuesque Otto statue; the bootie is made from 6,000 sq ft of calfskin and hand-cut foam, while the buckle was created with a 3-D printer, and the design even comes complete with a fully functional zipper. 

Little and large: The replica shoe weighs almost 150 times the original Otto design

'I’ve never had kids, but I feel like I just had one,' Jill admitted. 'It was stressful, exhilarating, random. It was a real labor of love.'

The whole shoe weighs a whopping 150 pounds, nearly 150 times the original wearable version currently on sale on the Kenneth Cole website.

'We met with ten different shoe builders because it is not easy to find somebody to build [this],' Jill said.

'There are lots of shoe makers, but there are not many shoe builders,' Kenneth added. 

The shoe is currently on display at department store Lord & Taylor’s flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York.
