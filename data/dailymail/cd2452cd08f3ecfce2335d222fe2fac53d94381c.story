A photographer has captured these poignant pictures showing the life of the outcast transgender people in Bangladesh.

Shahria Sharmin decided to get to know the transsexual minority group, known as Hijras, who are shunned from society in most of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

Her eye-opening portrait series, titled ‘Call me Heena’, highlights the struggles faced by males who choose to live as females – known as the ‘third’ or ‘unknown gender’.

Shahria Sharmin captured these poignant pictures of the transgender community in Bangladesh known as Hijras in a portrait series entitled 'Call me Heena'

Her pictures highlight the struggles faced by males who choose to live as females. Pictured is Zorina, 25, who said she wishes one day she would wake up and find she had become a woman

Meeting Heena, 51 (pictured above) changed the Bangladeshi photographer's opinion of the transgender community she had been brought up to see as less human

The 42-year-old Bangladeshi photographer, who is currently studying in London, said: ‘In Bangladesh Hijras hardly get an opportunity to have a normal life.

‘They do not have any school to study, no temple to pray in, no government and private organisations would want to see them in their employee list.

‘They have no access to legal system nor do even health service providers welcome them.’

She added: ‘I, like almost everyone else in my society, was raised to see them as less than human. Their habits, way of life, and even their looks marked them as apart, different and deviant.

'Always desiring to be a mother I have adopted Boishakhi. But I wonder what if she calls me father someday,' said 27-year-old Salma, a newly transgender mother

‘Then I met Heena and she made me see how wrong I was. She opened her life to me, made me a part of her world and helped me to see beyond the word Hijra.

‘She made me understand her, and others who live in her community, as the mothers, daughters, friends and lovers that they actually are.’

As well as speaking with 51-year-old Heena, she also met and photographed other people in the Bangladeshi transgender community including Shumi, 22, and Priya, 26.

While 21-year-old Nishi told her she was waiting for the man of her dreams and Salma, 27, who has adopted baby Boishakhi, wonders if she will call her father instead of mother one day.

Hijras have been part of South Asia’s culture for thousands of years but it was only when the British came to power in India in 1897 that outraged colonists introduced a law classing them as criminals.

The word ‘hijra’ is an Urdu-Hindustani word derived from Semitic Arabic root meaning ‘leaving one’s tribe’.

In 2013 the Bangladeshi Government formally recognised hijras as a third gender. This was followed by India in January of this year.

Chaiti, 32, above, prefers to define herself as 'third gender', which is now officially recognised and can be used on passports by Hijras in Bangladesh and India
