Terence Kirby may have strangled his estranged wife before taking his own life, two years after the couple separated.

The 72-year-old was found dead next to his wife Myrna Kirby, 57, at his bungalow home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. 

It is not yet known how Mrs Kirby died but police are believed to be investigating the possibility that she was strangled or killed with drugs.

Double deaths: The family of Terence Kirby, 72, pictured with estranged wife Myrna who he is believed to have killed before taking his own life, said they are 'struggling to comprehend the situation'

it is understood investigating officers are waiting for the results of toxicology tests, due at the end of the month.

The former couple's family said today that they are 'struggling to comprehend the situation.'

They also paid tribute to the pair, describing them as 'dedicated and loving parents'.

A statement from the couple's family, including their children Connie Kirby, 24, and Frederick Kirby, 27, read: 'We are all still trying to come to terms with the shocking and tragic news of what happened last week.

'Our parents always wanted the best for us and were incredibly dedicated and loving.

'We
are still trying to comprehend the situation and ask that we can be 
left alone to grieve in peace at this extremely difficult time.'

It is understood the couple, who have
been named locally, separated around two years ago and Mrs Kirby moved 
out of the family home and into a flat in Waltham Cross, Herts.

Police were called to the house at around 6.30pm on Friday and discovered Mr Kirby and his wife dead.

Mrs Kirby is believed to have visited the family home on Friday before the incident took place.

Police sources say Mrs Kirby's death is being treated as murder and 
they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the killing.

But Hertfordshire Constabulary refused to name the dead man and woman until they have informed all of the next of kin.

A police spokeswoman said post mortem examinations have been carried out, but refused to be drawn on the causes of death.

One
neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The whole family moved 
into the house, but the wife moved out after about 18 months to two 
years ago.

'They had a
son and daughter who must be in their 20s now. I heard that his wife 
had come round on Friday. The neighbour saw her and spoke to her. 

Investigation: The bungalow in Cheshunt, Herts, owned by Terence Kirby where he and his wife Mynra were both found dead. A family statement described the pair as 'incredibly dedicated and loving' parents

Murder: Police have confirmed they are treating one of the deaths at the property as murder and are not looking for anyone else in connection with the killing

She
added that Mr Kirby, who owned two Mercedes for his chauffeur job, had 
become a difficult neighbour since the separation from his wife.

She continued: 'He
started being a bad neighbour after 
the break up of his marriage. I think they had a difficult break-up. But
he can't have been that upset about it as he had several other 
women round.

'He was not a very nice man. He caused problems in the neighbourhood. 

'He was known to have arguments with people walking past his bungalow. He wasn't very sociable.

'We
had someone from the council round because he didn't look after his dog
- a border collie. He used to tie it up at the back all the time.'

Separation: Terence Kirby - who owned a high-end chauffeur company - is believe to have separated from his wife two years ago

Former family home: It is believed the couple lived together at the bungalow in Cheshunt, pictured, before Mrs Kirby moved out to a flat in nearby Waltham Cross

A Hertfordshire 
Constabulary spokeswoman confirmed that the man and woman were known to 
each other. She also confirmed that detectives are treating Mrs Kirby's 
death as murder, but are not looking for anyone else.

DCI Jon Hutchinson, from the 
Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, who is 
leading the investigation, said: 'We are continuing to investigate the 
circumstances surrounding this tragic incident.

'We are treating one of the deaths as murder, however we are not looking for anyone else in connection with it.'

Mr Kirby had been the director of his own high-end chauffeur company for nine years and Mrs Kirby was the business' secretary.

It is not clear whether Mrs Kirby took the couple's two children 
Connie Kirby, 24, and Frederick Kirby, 27, with her when the couple 
separated.

A close 
friend and neighbour of the Kirby family, who asked not to be named, 
today said: 'It is a tragic incident and their children are very upset. I
do not feel that it would be appropriate for us to say anything.'
