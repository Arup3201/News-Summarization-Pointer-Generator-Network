Liverpool have offered Jordan Henderson an improved contract worth £80,000-per-week.

Henderson, who joined Liverpool from Sunderland in 2011, has just over 18 months left to run on his existing deal - which is worth in the region of £65,000-per-week.

But the Anfield club want to tie the England international down to new terms after fully-establishing himself as an integral member of Brendan Rodgers' first-team.

Talks regarding fresh terms are well underway and an offer has now been made to the club's vice-captain.

The new deal is understood to be a five-year contract, worth just over £4million per season.

Whether the terms are enough to convince Henderson to sign the contract remains to be seen, but Liverpool are determined to secure the midfielder's long-term future.

The Merseysiders' attempts to tie Henderson down to a new deal forms part of their contract renewal drive.

Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday how the club had offered right-back Glen Johnson a new contract.

The right back is out of contract at the end of the season, and the Anfield club have now made the England international an offer.

But the deal is worth in the region of £60,000-per-week - 50 per cent less than his current £120,000-per-week salary.

Johnson is understood to be reluctant to accept the club's current offer, casting doubt over his future at the club.

Johnson can start pre-contract negotiations with foreign clubs in January, and it is looking increasingly likely that he will leave Liverpool at the end of the season.

Italian club Roma have shown an interest in the former Chelsea defender.

Securing the future of starlet Raheem Sterling is the club's most pressing concern, while captain Steven Gerrard, who's is out of contract in the summer, is also set for contract extension talks.
