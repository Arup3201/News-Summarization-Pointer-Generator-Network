A 'sweet' two-year-old boy tragically died after choking on a pushpin at a nursery owned by his mother’s cousin.

Jacorey Davis was found unresponsive at Trina's Treehouse daycare in Louisville, Kentucky, by staff on Monday and later died in hospital.

His mother Jessica Davis said a nursery employee heard a bang and was shocked to see Jacorey had turned blue and was foaming at the mouth.

Ms Davis dropped Jacorey off at the centre at 10:30am and he was found unresponsive just hours later at 2pm before being taken to hospital.

‘One of the daycare workers heard a big boom - like, maybe he had fell, and she said: "Jacorey!",' Ms Davis told WLKY News.

‘And she ran over there, and when she picked him up, he was blue and he was foaming at the mouth.’

Police do not suspect any foul play and the coroner’s office are not 100 per cent certain that the boy tried to eat the pin at the daycare centre.

Ms Davis described the harrowing experience of arriving just before he died at the hospital and knowing that ‘basically, he was gone’.

‘It was just like a nightmare,’ she told WLKY News. ‘I was shocked.’

The boy’s grandmother Renisha Woods-Vertrees told WLKY News: ‘I want to know why my grandbaby went to daycare and came home dead.’

A spokesman for the daycare centre said staff followed the correct procedure by immediately performing CPR and calling 911.

Ms Davis - whose cousin owns the daycare centre according to NBC affiliates - said he was ‘sweet’ and ‘touched everybody in a different way’.

The family had originally thought the boy had a seizure, before Jefferson County Deputy Coroner Jim Wesley revealed details about the pushpin.

Ms Davis wrote on Facebook: 'Here today and gone tomorrow - we can never question God's will. I'm strong and I know everything has a purpose.'

She added: ‘My son was my heart and if it was up to me God could have taken me rather than my son - but everything happens (for) a reason.’
