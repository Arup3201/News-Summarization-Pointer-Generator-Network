The top executives at several organizations that received taxpayer-funded bailouts also received increasingly generous salaries and bonuses, a watchdog group alleged Monday.

The internal watchdog group, which keeps check on taxpayer bailouts, further noted that the U.S. Treasury Department failed to curb this spending for the second year running.

The CEOs of three companies that received major bailouts – AIG, General Motors, and Ally Financial – each received ‘excessive’ pay for the last two years and fought Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to ensure they would receive full pay.

Payout: Top executives at firms that received taxpayer bailouts still receive government-approved 'excessive' compensation, SIGTARP said Monday, with dozens receiving more than the pre-approved $500,000 salary

Pay day: Treasury-approved pay packages of $5million or more went to the CEOs of Ally, AIG, and GM, the watchdog firm claims

The report, which was published by the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Trouble Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), shows that 68 out of 69 executives at the three companies received an annual compensation of at least $1million, oftentimes much more.

And the Treasury signed off on it, the report claims.

The report also states that the top 16 executives within AIG, GM, and Ally received a combined pay of over $100 million.

One of Congress’ goals when it passed the TARP program was to curb ‘excessive’ executive pay among top managers. But the report claims that CEOs still got heavily compensated, with the Treasury's so-called 'pay czar' approving multi-million dollar pay packages.

The Treasury's pay czar, or 'special master’ Patricia Geoghegan, was tasked with limiting 'excessive' pay at companies the government bailed out using taxpayer money during the financial crisis.

But the Office of the Special Master did not follow the rules it had set for compensation, instead letting companies define pay themselves, according to a report by the inspector general for the government's bailout program.

In 2012, the pay czar acceded to company requests in approving multi-million dollar pay packages and pay hikes for top executives at General Motors, AIG and Ally Financial.

The pay czar approved all 18 pay raises requested by the companies, for a total of $6.2 million, and approved pay packages of at least $1 million for 68 of the 69 employees at the companies it was overseeing, the report found.

'While taxpayers struggle to overcome the recent financial crisis and look to the U.S. government to put a lid on compensation for executives of firms whose missteps nearly crippled the U.S. financial system, the U.S. Department of the Treasury continues to allow excessive executive pay,' the report said.

Ms Geoghegan said in the report that it was normal for the top executives at these firms to receive more than the suggested $500,000. 

SIGTARP fired back: ‘That might be true if companies had not been bailed out and were not still significantly owned by taxpayers.’

Special Inspector General Christy Romero said it was not surprising companies asked for large pay packages and higher pay. 'But what we saw in 2012 that is somewhat different than prior years is that this time the companies pushed back on pay, but they seemed to have met no resistance,' she said in an interview with Reuters.

Romero is tasked with overseeing the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, which pumped $68 billion into AIG, $50 billion in GM and $17 billion in Ally Financial, among others, to save them from collapse during the 2007-2009 crisis.

In December, the Treasury sold the last of its common stock in AIG and said it plans to sell its remaining shares in automaker GM in the next year or so, leaving Ally as the last major company that still owes the government under TARP.

The acting pay czar, Patricia 
Geoghegan, said her office achieved its mission, cutting average cash 
compensation for the top 25 executives at bailed-out companies from what
they were getting prior to the TARP bailout.

In 2011 and 2012, the office also froze pay for the chief executives of General Motors, AIG, and Ally Financial.

'While taxpayers struggle to overcome the
recent financial crisis and look to the U.S. government to put a lid on
compensation for executives of firms whose missteps nearly crippled the
U.S. financial system, the U.S. Department of the Treasury continues to
allow excessive executive pay.'

But last year, Romero's office found pressure from financial institutions undermined efforts to limit executive pay at bailed-out companies, especially as some Treasury officials were more concerned with getting TARP funds back than in limiting pay.

Romero said the situation has worsened since then. Contrary to recommendations the inspector general made last year, the pay czar's office has not developed procedures for how to decide compensation or when to determine high salaries are warranted.

'Without developing some criteria ... Treasury put itself in a position of essentially letting the companies drive what pay Treasury was approving,' she said.

Under the rules governing pay for TARP recipients, cash salaries are supposed to rarely exceed $500,000.

But in 2012, 70 percent of the top executives at TARP recipients overseen by the government had cash salaries of $500,000 or more, a number that has quadrupled since 2009, the report said. Ninety-four percent got cash compensation of $450,000 or more.

Romero said in one situation, the Treasury approved a pay raise of $50,000 for one GM employee because the company wanted to 'do a little extra for him.

'This shows the complete lack of appreciation that GM has for the fact that they're owned by taxpayers, and that Americans are in tight budgets and don't have any extra (funds),' she said.

In another case, the pay czar approved a $200,000 pay raise for an employee of Residential Capital LLC, the bankrupt mortgage lending unit of Ally, despite knowing the unit was about to go bankrupt.Romero said the government's pay curbs were unlikely to have a lasting impact.

The report found it likely AIG will return to its 'past practices' in setting high executive compensation now that it has repaid the government's TARP funds.

'The responsibility shifts to the Federal Reserve Board to ensure that AIG does not encourage excessive risk taking through compensation,' the report said.
