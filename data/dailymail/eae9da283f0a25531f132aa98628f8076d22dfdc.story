Crammed full of dusty syringes, bottled antidotes, and rattling equipment - with a half-smoked pipe on the table - the owner of this doctor's surgery could have just popped out.

But in fact it has lain derelict for more than a decade - and gathered a thick layer of dust over the years.

Abandoned in mysterious circumstances, the mansion in Virton, Belgium, still has semi-full glasses of wine on the tables, and meticulously ordered equipment in antique glass cabinets smothered in cobwebs.

Bygone era: The equipment in this old doctor's surgery in Virton, Belgium, was left in perfect order when it was abandoned in 1980 - despite slight decay

Ghost-like: The doctor's unfinished cigar, glasses and newspaper were left on the table as if he were half-way through his morning reading

French photographer Matti Decaux, 27, who found the home, said: 'This one is a strange for me, as it seems to be part home, part office and part surgery.

'It really felt odd wandering around, as it was as if the owner had just left for a paper and would return at any moment - the only way to tell otherwise was the layer of dust covering the contents of the property.

'The surgery area was very interesting as there was old equipment left behind, and it was all neatly laid out.

Historic: The medicines cluttered around the house look ancient compared to our plastic packets today. Syringes and scalpels lie sprawled over glass-topped desks

Not quite the NHS: Patients would recline in a king size bed with plush blue satin sheets and a gold wooden frame facing the open windows

Mysteriously, open bottles and half-filled glasses remain on the tables, with coats slung on the back of the beautiful, velvet chairs

'But, to be honest, with it being a 
multi-use building there was much to see, all of which seemed as though 
it was very well cared for when the owner was still there.'

Seemingly abandoned at some point in the 1980s, the house in the south of Belgium has been dubbed 'Dr Pepito's mansion' and is made up of three stories - part residential and part surgery.

Mr Decaux, 27, says: 'I receive a very mixed reaction from people who see these photographs.

'Some love to see them and hear the tales of what once may have gone on in there. Although, some will just never understand why I find these places interesting.

'I really enjoy capturing places that once were loved but now have been left for Mother Nature to reclaim.'

The house has become local legend, with many stories circulated about what could have happened to the family that left without notice or trace

Classic: A typical doctor's briefcase gathers dust on a chair in the corner of an office

Memories: Boxes of photographs all over the house span generations, including the family's landmarks events like weddings, births and birthdays
