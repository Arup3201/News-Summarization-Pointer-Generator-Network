Taster: Margot Woelk had to taste Adolf Hitler's food before he ate it to ensure it was not poisoned

This is the woman tasked with tasting Adolf Hitler's meals to ensure the Fuhrer's food was not poisoned.

For more than two years Margot Woelk risked her life by sampling food prepared for Hitler at his Eastern front HQ dubbed the Wolf's Lair.

The now 95-year-old was picked up by the SS in 1942 after being evacuated from Berlin to the East Prussian village of Gross Partsch - in modern-day Poland - where she was set to work tasting fresh produce to be served up to the paranoid Nazi leader.

Mrs Woelk was one of 15 women forced to test Hitler's food before it passed his lips at the Rastenburg base.

As her fellow Germans were existing on rations, Mrs Woelk feasted on fresh fruit and vegetables, including asparagus, peppers and peas.

But the now elderly woman has revealed the fear she felt at sampling the leader's meals during the Second World War, saying: 'We had no choice'.

Mrs Woelk's mother-in-law had offered her a place to stay in the countryside when her husband Karl left to join the fighting and a bomb tore the roof from her Berlin apartment, leaving the secretary homeless.

But shortly after she arrived she was earmarked by the SS to perform the bizarre role alongside 14 other unwilling female food tasters.

Mrs Woelk told the Times: 'Of
 course I was afraid. If it [the food] had been poisoned I would not be 
here today. We were forced to eat it, we had no choice.'

Hitler would only deign to touch his food after all 15 women had sampled it and at least an hour had elapsed, she explained.

'Between 11 and 12 o'clock, we had to 
taste the food, and only after all 15 of us had tried it was it driven to the headquarters by the SS,' Mrs Woelk said.

'It was all vegetarian, the most 
delicious fresh things, from asparagus to peppers and peas, served with 
rice, and salads. It was all arranged on one plate, just as it was 
served to him.'

Mrs Woelk, who was not required to taste meat or fish as the leader was a vegetarian, had to report every day, but was only used when Hitler's personal train was in the station. She said she had been rounded up by the SS because the Nazi leader wanted only 'good German stock' testing his food.

There was always an hour's delay before Hitler tucked into his meal so that any effects of the food on the women could be seen, she said.

Mrs Woelk told the Daily Express she and her husband had been 'just two people trying to survive' when the Nazis arrived, and that neither had been party members.

Despite coming to feel like a 'laboratory rabbit' Mrs Woelk said she quickly learned 'you didn't argue with the SS'.

'Hitler was so paranoid that the British would poison him - that's why he had 15 girls taste the food before he ate it himself,' said Margot. Above, Adolf the vegetarian with German officers in 1945

She
 lived with her mother-in-law outside the HQ while she performed the bizarre role until the unsuccessful 
assassination attempt on Hitler's life by Claus von Stauffenberg with a 
briefcase bomb in July 1944.

From that moment she was confined to a school building and could only see her mother-in-law at weekends watched by the SS.

When Hitler abandoned the lair after 800 days in November 1944, a senior officer helped her escape back to Berlin by smuggling her on board Joseph Goebbels' train.

She believes the other tasters were shot by the advancing Russians.

While she escaped a similar fate, Mrs Woelk told the Daily Express she was forced to endure a devastating ordeal when she was raped by soldiers from the Red Army.

In 1946 she was eventually reunited with the husband she had presumed dead, and the couple lived together until Mr Woelk's death in 1990.
