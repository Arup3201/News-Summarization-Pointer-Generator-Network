An Iowa City police officer has helped deliver a baby on the side of the road, after pulling over its father who was speeding on the way to the hospital.

Officer Kevin Wolfe stopped the vehicle on Sunday night, and the panicked driver jumped out and yelled, 'Sir, we're delivering a baby right here, right now!'

Wolfe said that by the time he reached the passenger door of the couple's black SUV, the baby's head and arms were already out.

The six-year police force veteran assisted in the final stages of the delivery and wrapped the child in a blanket.

He then escorted the family, who haven't been named and didn't want to be interviewed, to Mercy Iowa City hospital, two blocks from where the child was delivered.

Wolfe, whose dashboard camera captured the incredible episode, said he had not expected a baby to be born right there on the roadside.

'I had every expectation that when they said they were having a baby they meant there was a baby on the way and we would drive to the hospital and I would shake their hand and say "good luck."' he said. 'But the baby's head and arms were already out.'

The baby, the couple's third child, can be heard crying on the police tape.

The shocked, and hardworking, mother repeatedly yells 'Oh my God' as her little one is born with only a few pushes.

'Congratulations, this my first one on the road so,' Wolfe can be heard telling the couple.

Later he told KCRG.com: 'I think everybody was equally surprised. I'd say it's pretty crazy, this one I'll be telling for a while.'

The mother and newborn were discharged from the hospital on Wednesday and are said to be in good health. It's not clear whether the baby is a boy or a girl.

Police spokeswoman Vicki Lalla says Wolfe didn't end up issuing a speeding ticket and did not take down the parents' names.Â
