Busted: Robert Johns, 37, was arrested after police seized a massive arsenal of guns and ammo from his car

A homeless man from San Francisco has been arrested on multiple drug and weapons charges after police said they found a massive cache of guns and ammunition in his car. 

Robert Johns, 37, was taken into custody on July 21 in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, where officers found a Jeep filled with guns, knives, a shotgun, close to 6,000 bullets and camouflage gear.

According to police, they also seized a card from Johns’ vehicle containing a list of several national politicians, reportedly including President Obama, according to CBS5. 

Johns had an earlier run-in with law enforcement when he was stopped by officers on June 30 for puffing on a cigarette at Alvord Lake in Golden Gate Park, where smoking is prohibited.

During that interaction, Johns made ‘strange comments’ to the officers about wanting to harm a family member, and gave them permission to search his car, where they found a loaded 12-gauge shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle, San Francisco police Chief Greg Suhr said during a news conference Wednesday.

Johns was taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was placed on a mental health detention, but he was later released.

On July 17, police received a report from a local Yoga studio about someone living in a vehicle in the area who was harassing and threatening people. Officers found the unoccupied car and issued a 72-hour notice to move it, Suhr said.

Dangerous cache: As many as 5,800 rounds of ammunition and 14 knives were confiscated from Johns' Jeep in late July

Disturbing finds: Beside weapons and bullets, police seized survival equipment and camouflage clothing from Johns' Jeep

Neighbors on Waller Street where Johns’ vehicle was found said he parked in the same spot day after day and spent hours sitting inside amid piles of trash spilling out of the car, NBC reported. 

Although the Jeep was plastered with multiple parking tickets, that vehicle was never towed, leading some residents to wonder whether the driver was an undercover police officer.

When police returned on July 21, they found that Johns was inside his Jeep Cherokee and beginning to drive away, and they pulled it over. During the stop, officers saw a short-barrel rifle in plain view in the driver's side door, and found a loaded 9mm handgun under the driver's seat, according to Suhr.

A subsequent search of the car yielded 5,800 rounds of ammunition, 14 knives, a survival kit, a rifle scope, marijuana and a methamphetamine ‘cookbook,’ and $900 in cash, police said.

Response to backlash: San Francisco police Chief Greg Suhr said his officers were justified in not further searching Johns' car during their first encounter

Suhr said he was not aware of a specific threat made against any of the politicians on the card, nor anyone else. Johns told a reporter he collected the weapons and never intended to harm anyone.

However, the disturbing discovery - 
made one day after the tragic Colorado movie theater massacre - put 
local residents on edge. Some people were quick to criticize the police 
department for letting Johns slip away nine weeks prior.

This week, Suhr defended the actions of his officers, saying that they were justified in not further searching Johns’ Jeep following the June 30 encounter since they were primarily concerned with his mental health.

‘I think the officers did a good job at the time in evaluating the person in crisis and the approach they took,’ Suhr said.

The FBI was notified of the arrest, but local authorities are handling the case, Suhr said. Authorities are still not sure where Johns obtained the weapons.

The district attorney's complaint states that Johns imported one of the guns into California and planned to sell it, ABC7 reported.

‘We're glad to get all of these weapons off the streets,’ Suhr said.

Johns has pleaded not guilty to eight felony and misdemeanor weapon and drug charges, and his bail was set at $100,000. 

The suspect is expected to return to court on August 7 for his preliminary hearing.
