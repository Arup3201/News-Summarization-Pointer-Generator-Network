For evidence that we are becoming more self-centred, you need look no further than your bookshelf.

Analysis of more than 1.5million books has revealed the use of the word ‘get’ has gone up while ‘give’ has fallen out of favour.

Modern books also favour feelings over religion and choice over obedience.

Analysis of more than 1.5million books has revealed the use of the word ¿get¿ has gone up while ¿give¿ has gone down

The changes, revealed in a study of British and American books published between 1800 and 2000, including popular and academic works.

The University of California researchers say the changes in the printed work reflect the change in values that comes with urbanisation, with caring, sharing rural communities being increasingly replaced by materialistic, go-getting town and city-dwellers.

Psychologist Patricia Greenfield used a computer programme provided by Google to assess the frequency key words appeared in almost 1.2million American books.

Key words included ‘obliged’, picked because of the importance of duty in small family-orientated communities,  and ‘choose’, a word which denotes the freedom of choice important to modern generations.

The use of ‘obliged’ fell at least six-fold over the 200 year studied, while ‘choose’ became increasingly common.  By the 1930s, authors spoke more of choice than they did of obligation.

Frequency of use of the words ‘act’ and ‘feel’ was also compared.

Other recent research found that modern-day British novels lack emotion

By the 1970s, books spoke more of feelings than of actions.

The analysis, published in the journal Psychological Science also showed a move from giving to getting.

Use of the word ‘get’ quadrupled from 1800 to 2000, reflecting, it is though a move towards a more materialistic society.

However, there was a blip in its rise between 1940 and 1960. 

Researchers say this could be a reflection of a greater community spirit during the Second World War and the civil rights movement.

The study also revealed the words ‘obedience’, ‘authority’, ‘belong’ and ‘pray’ to be in decline.

The task was repeated using an online library of 350,000 British books which produced similar results.

Professor Greenfield said: ‘These replications indicate that the underlying concepts, not just word frequencies, have been changing in historical importance over time.

‘Developing countries have become wealthier, more urbanised, more technologically advanced and more highly educated.

‘But the process also applies to countries such as the United States and United Kingdom.

‘The trend is particularly noticeable if one views the situation over a timescale of centuries, as in the present study.’ 

Other recent research found that modern-day British novels lack emotion – perhaps because we have started to feel it is a weakness to show our feelings.
