A family firm has accused Amazon of using ‘bullying’ tactics to kill off small businesses.

Healthy lifestyle company UK Juicers used the internet giant’s online marketplace to sell its products, hoping to expand its customer base.

But the firm said that rather than just selling the goods, Amazon tracked which products did well before going directly to suppliers and offering the same items more cheaply.

UK Juicers, based in York, says it has exclusive UK rights to sell The Spiralizer, pictured above, which turns vegetables and fruit into pasta-like ribbons 

But directors Nick Ledger and Paul Hellawell say they are now being undercut by Amazon, who allegedly went straight to the German manufacturers to sell the product itself

This ‘underhand practice’ leaves small businesses unable to compete as they cannot match Amazon’s prices, UK Juicers claimed.

The
 directors of the York-based firm, Nick Ledger and his uncle Paul 
Hellawell, said: ‘It’s not just an economy of scale offering better 
prices to the consumer – it’s also an economy of bullying and strong-arm
 tactics.’ UK Juicers sells a kitchen gadget known as a ‘spiralizer’ 
that turns vegetables into pasta-like ribbons.

It
 can be used to spin a courgette into a bowl of ‘spaghetti’, for 
example, and has proved popular with healthy eaters. The firm said it 
had obtained the exclusive UK rights to sell the machine, made by German
 manufacturer Lurch, and set up a deal to trade through Amazon 
Marketplace.

But after UK 
Juicers was ‘upgraded’ to Amazon’s premium sellers’ service this summer,
 its owners noticed the Lurch spiralizer was now also being sold 
directly by Amazon. Mr Ledger told The Independent: ‘Amazon was soon 
undercutting us by going directly to the manufacturer we’d worked so 
hard to locate and secure. It then charged us for the stock we had 
sitting in its warehouses but could no longer shift.’

When
 UK Juicers complained and pulled out of the deal, Amazon boasted it 
sought to stock ‘every product on earth’ and refused to ‘promise not to 
go direct with certain manufacturers’. Stacy Mitchell, from the 
Institute for Local Self-Reliance in the US, said: ‘Small 
retailers … feel they have no choice but to become an Amazon seller. 
It’s a deal with the devil, though.

‘You
 are basically giving your biggest competitor everything you have of 
value, including your product expertise and your customers.’

An Amazon spokesman said its sellers’ services were ‘democratising the ability to start an online business’.

Amazon said it was 'democratising the ability to start an online business in the UK' and had helped thousands of small businesses

Amazon is driving book publishers ‘to the wall’ as it rakes in huge profits, a leading industry figure claimed.

Toby
 Munday, former chief executive of Atlantic Books, claimed the online 
retailer’s grip on the publishing market was changing it beyond 
recognition.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: ‘Amazon can 
demand 30 to 50 per cent of profit and no publisher can live with that 
very easily … we are on the verge of quite radical changes just so some 
people in Seattle can make even more money.’
