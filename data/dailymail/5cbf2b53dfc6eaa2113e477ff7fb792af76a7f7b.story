A barber who used a megaphone to warn motorists of traffic wardens near his shop has been silenced after being put on a council ‘blacklist’.

Andy Blackwell was popular with those he saved from a possible parking fine.

But he says that after issuing one of his warning cries recently, two ‘angry’ wardens confronted him and he was later visited by police.

Warning: Andy Blackwell, claims he has received a warning letter from Cornwall Council, after warning locals in Liskeard when traffic wardens were approaching using his loudspeaker

Now Cornwall Council has put him on 
its ‘cautionary contacts list’ which is designed to prevent risk to its 
employees – and he has decided to hang up his megaphone.

Mr
Blackwell, 51, who runs a barber shop called Blackie’s, in Liskeard, 
said his original aim was ‘to warn people that traffic wardens were in 
the area, so they had a fair chance of moving their cars’.

He added: ‘As far as I was concerned I was doing a public service. It’s a little bit of fun, and people have thanked me.’

Public service: Mr Blackwell said the council had placed him on their 'cautionary contacts list' but described his warnings as a public service

Of the recent incident, he recalled: 
‘There were two of them booking a repeat offender so I decided to warn 
the public and went out with my loudhailer.

'The traffic wardens came hurtling 
round – one of them tripped over. One said they were going to tell the 
police. I realised then they were getting very angry.

‘I never threatened or cursed or 
swore or offended anybody. As far as I was aware I was just having a bit
of fun and doing a public service.

'When I told the police what had gone 
on they gave me plenty of advice and said be careful because the council
take a dim view of this.’

Three days later he received a letter from the council saying he’d been placed on the ‘cautionary contacts list’.

He was told he would remain in the files for a year for ‘verbally abusing’ two wardens who suffered ‘extreme distress’.

Deterrent: The hairdresser has long campaigned against parking fares in the town, claiming they deter shoppers from coming to the town centre

Warnings: Mr Blackwell said the warning letter referred to an incident when he had warned the public about two traffic wardens operating in an area

Mr Blackwell said he did not want to 
‘antagonise’ the council further so would no longer use the megaphone, 
although customers would still be allowed to.

He added: ‘The traffic wardens don’t move people on, they just issue tickets and generate income.’

He has now started a petition for free parking in the town.

Last year he began dishing out his own
‘tickets’ on cars – which contained £1 in cash as a contribution 
towards drivers’ parking costs, to help local businesses.

He said the £1 gift was designed to 
encourage visitors back to the town, adding: ‘Even if you do pay, the 
traffic wardens are on your case if you’re five minutes late.

‘If they were to back off, people would come in to town. They don’t want to be given a parking fine.

‘The council might as well put barbed wire fencing and dogs around to stop people coming in.’

Mr Blackwell has won support from 
other Liskeard residents. Shopkeeper Rosie Harmsworth, 32, whose husband
is a customer of Mr Blackwell, said: ‘I hear the siren and I chuckle.

Abuse: A Cornwall Council spokesman said the cautionary contacts lists is 'an internal system which aims to protect council staff from potentially harmful situations, including physical assault and verbal abuse'

'The traffic wardens appear from nowhere and I spend most of my wages on parking.

‘Fines are about £50 or £60 and that 
is really expensive. Andy has been great and he even puts pound coins on
people’s windscreens.’

She added: ‘The traffic wardens are a bit sad. They need to chill out and take a joke.’

Grocer Andrew Beddow, 47, said: ‘The wardens are very aggressive. They pointed their fingers in Andy’s face and it is not on.

‘No one can afford the fines they give out. They are out of order for reporting him when they could have had a quiet word.

‘They need to see the funny side of it and leave him alone.’

Cornwall Council said in a statement: 
‘The cautionary contacts list is an internal system which aims to 
protect council staff from potentially harmful situations, including 
physical assault and verbal abuse.

‘Many local authorities around the country have similar schemes in place.

‘This information is only used within 
the council and is only available to those employees who may potentially
be exposed to such risks.’
