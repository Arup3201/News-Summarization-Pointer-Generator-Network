Never-before-seen footage from the frantic aftermath of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 runway crash in July reveals that firefighters tragically did not realize that a 16-year-old victim was still alive - only to run her over twice 15 minutes later.

Video from a camera mounted on a San Francisco firetruck shows at least two emergency workers alerting vehicles to go around Chinese student Ye Meng Yuan as she lay on the ground by the stricken aircraft. The first responders believed she was dead and did not check her vital signs.

One lieutenant told crash investigators that she made 'a three second' visual assessment of Miss Yuan and automatically assumed 'that's our first casualty' - without putting a finger to her pulse or checking if she was still breathing.

Less than 15 minutes after the first driver had seen Miss Yuan, they drove over the teen who was now covered in the foam being used to douse the burning plane. Moments later, a second fire truck rode over the student's body.

The video, obtained byÂ CBS News last week, does not show the trucks running her over but the original footage is in the possession of the distraught teenage girl's family and legal team in China.

The official line from the San Francisco Fire Department is that the girl was accidentally struck by trucks racing to battle the fiery wreck of the Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 because she was hidden by foam sprayed over the plane.

However, the newly released footage shows that some emergency workers were aware there was a body in the vicinity - including the driver of the truck which ran over her first.

Ye was one of three people to die as the plane misjudged its landing at San Francisco on July 6 and struck its tail section on a sea wall as it came into land - 304 people survived.

The impact ripped off the back of the plane, tossed out three flight attendants and their seats, and scattered pieces of the jet across the runway as it spun and skidded to a stop.

Miss Yuan was one of three Chinese teenagers who died; the second died during the crash and another later in the hospital.

Her parents have filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, saying rescuers were reckless and poorly trained.

In their claim, attorneys representing Yuan's parents name 37 specific airport, fire and police department employees, saying they and others 'breached their duty of care'. They do not specify damages.

In the video footage, a firefighter can be clearly be heard saying: 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop,' to the driver of one of the first responding trucks at the scene.

'There's a body right there, right in front of you,' the firefighter adds.

Investigators all agree that at the time of this diversion, Miss Yuan was still alive.

Firefighters told investigators they assumed the girl was dead and instead hurried on toward the damaged aircraft. Newly released footage shows workers walking past her body without stopping.

An autopsy revealed Miss Yuan was alive before two fire vehicles hit her.

In an obituary, the teenager was described as a champion athlete who excelled at literature, playing piano, singing and public speaking. Her given name means 'wish come true' in Chinese.

It is still unknown how Miss Yuan got out of the plane but the claim says she was possibly taken out by rescuers.

Interviews for an ongoing National Traffic Safety Board found Miss Yuan was covered with foam and struck twice - once by a fire rig spraying foam whose driver had seen and driven around her earlier in the chaos and again 11 minutes later by a second truck that was turning around to fetch water.

Her death has prompted new training for firefighters who work at San Francisco International Airport, including 40 to 80 hours of advanced instruction at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

'There are many lessons to be learned here,' Assistant Deputy Chief Dale Carnes, who oversees the San Francisco Fire Department's airport division, said during a NTSB hearing in December.

'We are developing strategies to lessen the potential for firefighting vehicles impacting accident victims.'

The driver of the first of two San Francisco Fire Department rigs that struck the girl said that he was alerted less than 15 minutes earlier to avoid the her as she lay on the ground.

The footage, taken by a dashboard camera aboard the rig and reviewed last Thursday by The San Francisco Chronicle, sheds new light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Ye Meng Yuan.

Several firefighters who responded to the July 6 crash have told investigators they believed Miss Yuan was dead and that they had concentrated on rescuing passengers and crew members who were still aboard the burning Boeing 777.

No one has reported checking her vital signs, however.

The rig camera's footage shows that although the plane had crashed just a few minutes earlier, passengers were gone from the area where Miss Yuan lay and at one point a firefighter walked past her without looking down.

It also shows that the first rig that ran over Miss Yuan sprayed much of the flame-retardant foam that came to obscure her from drivers.

When the rig initially pulled up to the plane, the girl was lying on bare ground, the footage shows.

The dashboard camera's footage showed firefighter Roger Phillips waving his arms to direct the driver of a fire truck to travel around the girl.

The NTSB was later told that the firefighter assumed the girl was dead.

The footage shows no firefighter attempting to move Miss Yuan or mark her with a casualty flag, as first responders commonly do at disaster scenes.

Human error: Meanwhile, investigators have found no evidence of mechanical problems with Asiana Flight 214, putting the focus of the safety probe into the crash landing at the San Francisco airport squarely on the pilots

Justin Green is one of the attorneys representing her family.

'What the family wants is accountability,' he said to CBS News.

'They want to know why weren't the firefighters trained, why weren't the supervisors certified and why hasn't the fire department come clean about what happened?'

The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) does not comment on pending lawsuits.

SFFD Chief Mary Hayes-White has previously said: 'Our members that day had difficult decisions to make. One was visualizing someone that appeared to be dead versus going onto the burning plane with reports of people that still needed to be rescued.'
