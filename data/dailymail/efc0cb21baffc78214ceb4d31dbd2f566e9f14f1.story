Accused: Trina Rocker, 41, is charged with having a sexual relationship with former student

A high school secretary at a Christian school was arrested earlier this week after authorities discovered she was allegedly having an affair with a 17-year-old former student.

Trina Rocker, 41, had chaperoned the student’s trip to Washington, D.C., last year, and the two had sex in a laundry closet at a Holiday Inn in Richmond, Virginia.

The Haines City, Florida woman was arrested Monday after her relationship was uncovered by the boy’s parents.

Rocker, who worked three years at Landmark Christian Schools, had sent a series of texts to the student, including: ‘Didn’t you like not using a condom?’

According to WTSP.com, she also texted the student about how horrible it would be if she became pregnant. 

Landmark Christian Church co-pastor Steve Carter told Tampa Bay Online that all teachers are put through a background check before they are hired. 

‘Being a smaller Christian school, we have to think that there would be less chance of it here, but as we found out, shockingly, there is a chance of it to be here.’

He said there were no more than 90 students at the central Florida school.

Sordid affair: Rocker served as chaperone on a class trip to Washington, D.C.; the student said that the two had sex at a nearby Holiday Inn laundry room

Mr Carter said that the school takes certain precautions to try and avoid situations such as these.

‘Our teachers are not allowed to be friends with students on Facebook,’ he said.

The affair began in November 2011 and lasted seven months, WTSP.com reported.

The teen told the sheriff’s office that he and Rocker first had sex along U.S. Route 60, where they pulled over her car.

Their relationship burnt out after the student graduated. 

Rocker is being held at the Polk County Jail with no bail.
