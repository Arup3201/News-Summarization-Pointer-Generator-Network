A schoolboy has been left a ‘ticking time bomb’ after he developed a rare condition that affects just one in a million people.

Callum McGilligan, 9, was a keen ice hockey player when he began suffering ‘funny spells’.

The first diagnosis for Callum, of Longbenton, North Tyneside, was epilepsy.

Callum McGilligan's life has been shattered with his diagnosis of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Here he is with his parents Helen, 50, and Alex, 51

But as the episodes continued, he underwent repeated scans and blood tests, the results of which left doctors baffled.

Callum’s mother Helen McGilligan, 50, said: ‘They could come at any time, he is like he’s a ticking time bomb.’

It was when the family, including father Alex, 51, took Callum on a break in Wooler, Northumberland, that he suffered a major attack.

The prognosis for nine-year-old Callum McGilligan (left with his mother) is not good. The right side of his brain has been damaged leaving him with the educational capabilities of a four-year-old

Mrs McGilligan said: ‘He looked as if he’d had a stroke. We called an ambulance straight away and he was taken to the Great North Children’s Hospital at the Royal Victoria Infirmary.’

It was there that Callum was finally diagnosed with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC), a rare neurological disorder that can leave sufferers paralysed.

The diagnosis has changed the boy’s life forever.

Callum McGilligan was a keen ice hockey player until he began suffering what doctors initially diagnosed as epilepsy but was later found to be the very rare alternating hemiplegia of childhood

During Easter this year, Callum was hit by a massive attack which has damaged the right side of his brain. It has left him with the educational ability of a four or five-year-old, struggling to read or write

Alternating hemiplegia of Childhood is a condition that causes transient weakness of either, or both, sides of the body.

The attacks may alternate or sometimes overlap, that is the second side is affected before the first recovers.

Attacks start in the first eighteen months of life but the earliest episodes are often unusual irregular eye movements.

The attacks last from less than an hour, which is unusual, to several days.

AHC is caused by specific mutations in the gene ATP1A3.

Affected children usually have significant 
learning disabilities and motor organisational problems, including 
unsteadiness. 

All children and young adults are different and have different triggers.  Some common ones are:

Water – bathing and swimming.Anxiety, excitement.Changes/extremes of temperatureBright lights and loud noisesFluorescent lights/Low energy bulbsStrong odours (e.g. perfumes)Childhood illnesses and infectionsTiredness and lack of sleep

Mrs McGilligan said: ‘Callum’s gone from a happy-go-lucky little boy into one completely dependent on us.

‘Living with AHC is like living with a time bomb, waiting for it to go off and not knowing how bad the damage will be.’

During Easter this year, Callum was hit by a massive attack which has damaged the right side of his brain. It has left him with the educational ability of a four or five-year-old, struggling to read or write.’

The latest episode has forced Callum’s removal from his local school , St Stephen’s Roman Catholic Primary, and his move into a special one.

Calum has four elder siblings: Matthew, 30, Alexander, 18, and sisters Claire, 27, and Faye, 22.

Helen added: ‘Our latest hospital visits show that Callum’s condition will probably not be cured.

‘He does take medication to control things as much as possible.

‘Callum had loved to play ice hockey. He played for a team in Whitley Bay. That was what he loved doing but he’s never been back on the ice.'

The family hope that Callum’s story will help educate people about the shattering effects of AHC. They are also holding a charity day on August 10 at the Blue Flames Sporting Club in Longbenton.
