Victim: Andrea Rebello, 21, is shown as a senior in her high school yearbook in 2010. She was killed early Friday morning

Neighbors of the Hofstra University sorority girl who was fatally shot during an early morning break-in Friday say they heard blood-curdling screams and what sounded like a woman pleading for her life at the time of the killing.

Victoria Dehel, who lives four doors down from Andrea Rebello, the 21-year-old victim, told the New York Times that she heard shouting around 2 a.m. in their California Avenue neighborhood in Long Island.

At first is sounded like 'a bunch of drunk college students,' she told the Times.

'And then the screaming just got worse and worse and worse. And then we heard thuds, like five bangs,' she said. Dehel said she and her boyfriend stepped onto their porch and they could hear what sounded like a woman pleading for her life, just as police cars raced down the street.

'I turned to my boyfriend and I said, "I think someone just got murdered." It was awful,' she said.

Rebello was at home with three others,
including her twin sister, Jessica, when an armed man wearing a ski 
mask forced his way through the front door at 2:20 a.m. The home is just
a block from the campus.

Loss: The twins reportedly lived at the home just a block from campus with more of their sorority sisters

Horror: It is unknown at this time whether Rebello's twin sister witnessed the killing, but police confirmed that her sister had remained in the home while another girl was allowed outside

The suspect, who was not a student at 
the university, headed to the second floor of the home and held the 
residents hostage, according to reports.

He allowed one of the women to leave the home to withdraw money from an ATM and she called 911, Nassau County Deputy Inspector Kenneth Lack told NBC New York.

She
told the 911 dispatcher that the intruder had a silver handgun pointed 
at her friend's head in a second-floor bedroom, NBC reported. She added 
that there were multiple hostages.

The dispatcher passed the information to police and less than a minute later, Nassau
County police officers reached the home. 

When they arrived, shots went off. Lack said it is not clear who fired, but a law enforcement source told the New York Post it appeared the suspect killed Rebello and the police then killed him.

It is unknown at this time whether her twin sister witnessed the killing, but police confirmed that her sister had remained in the home while the other girl was allowed outside.

'We
don't know [the suspect's] motive at this time but it appears to be a 
robbery,' Chief Rick Capece said in a press conference on Friday.

Scene: She was home with two other girls and a male when the break in took place around 2.30am

One of the 
victim's friends told NBC that she was a member of the Beta Sigma Phi 
sorority and lived with six of her sorority sisters at the home.

Students
flocked to Twitter to express their grief at the killing, with many 
writing 'R.I.P' messages to Andrea and sending her twin sister their 
best wishes and prayers.

A private vigil was held at the Hofstra Student Center last night and it was announced today that her funeral will take place on Wednesday.

Rebello's father, Fernando, was too distraught to discuss the incident outside the family's Tarrytown, New York yesterday.

'It's my daughter, my baby daughter,' the landscaping company chief told the Journal News outside the home he shares with wife Nella. 

'She was so beautiful. I'm so confused.'

'I don't know what to do,' he added.

Her godmother told the newspaper: 'It's just too tragic'.

Andrea was
a junior at Hofstra studying Public Relations and Sociology and had attended Sleepy Hollow High School alongside her sister.

'I'm 100% Portuguese and have an identical twin sister so I guess that makes me kind of unique?' she wrote on her blog.

Principal Carol Conklin-Spillane said the girls were 'a set' and Andrea was devoted to her family who are close to other members of the Portuguese community who live in the area. 

'She had a devotion to family and sense of purpose and of opportunity,' she said.

Photographs
on her Facebook page show the girl as a popular student who enjoyed 
hanging out with friends and her twin sister, while her blog documents 
her cooking hobby.

Neighbors said their house had a vegetable garden and the twins would sometimes drop off the produce.

'They brought me some vegetables from their garden. They’re very nice people. They’d do anything for you,' Harris Bank told the New York Post.

Her funeral will be held at St. Teresa of Avila Church in Sleepy Hollow and will be officiated by the Rev. Osvaldo Franklin, of Our Lady of Fatima in Yonkers, who gave the twins their first communion.

He said they helped with Mass for several years after that.

Break in: Police said that the masked, armed intruder knocked on the front door before forcing his way inside the home and holding the friends, including Andrea (left), hostage

Authorities said Andrea's twin sister is now with their family.

Police
added that the unnamed male hostage is from Brooklyn, and the other 
female victim who escaped the home is from Connecticut.

Victoria Dehel, who lives four houses
away, said she had heard what sounded like fighting coming from the 
home. She ignored it as first, believing it was rowdy students coming 
home from a bar.

But then 'this girl was shrieking,' she said, and loud bangs followed just seconds later. 
'It didn’t sound good at all,' Dehel said. 'I turned to my boyfriend and
I said, "I think someone just got murdered." It was awful.'

Neighbors told CBS New York that they heard cries for help from the home.

Distraught: Hofstra University students gather near the house where the girl and an armed intruder were killed

Sadness: The suspect and the girl were both shot after police arrived at the Long Island home

'I
came home last night ten minutes before it happened and I heard 
screams,' one woman said. 'I ran outside and police officers were like, 'go back inside your house, go back inside your house'.'

Friends said the girls at the house, including the twins, had been out celebrating the end of the school year earlier that evening.

They went to a popular university bar, McHebes.

'The bar was really crowded, and all the sisters were there. They were [going] all-out because it’s the end of school,' Amanda Babyatsky, 22 told the Post.

On Friday morning, Hofstra University 
President Stuart Rabinowitz released a statement condemning the shooting
as a 'senseless act of violence'.

'The Nassau County Police have 
notified us that early this morning a Hofstra student was killed during a
tragic crime which took place in a rental house off campus,' the 
statement read.

'The police investigation is ongoing,
and we do not yet know all of the relevant details. What we do know is 
that a young member of the Hofstra family has been taken from us in a 
senseless act of violence.'

Home: The victim lived at the home which is just a block from the university campus with sorority sisters

Campus: The private university, on Long Island in New York, has nearly 13,000 students

Friday is the last day of exams
for students at the university and graduation is being held on Sunday, 
but Rabinowitz added that the ceremonies would go ahead as scheduled.

'The accomplishments of our graduates 
must be recognized, and together our community will heal and find the 
strength to move forward,' he said.

Hofstra University is a private 
college on Long Island, New York. Nearly 13,000 students attend the 
university, which is about 25 miles east of New York City.
