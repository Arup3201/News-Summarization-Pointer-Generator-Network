Iran has slashed its nuclear stockpile by almost 75 percent the International Atomic Energy Committee has confirmed.

The IAEA has spent the past six months investigating whether the Tehran regime has complied with its international obligations.

In a report to the United Nations, the IAEA has confirmed that Iran halted aspects of its nuclear programme on January 20 opening the possibility of the easing of international sanctions.

As a result of Iran's compliance with the international agreement it is now possible for Tehran to access foreign currency reserves frozen since the dispute arose.

The IAEA confirmed that Iran has diluted half of its higher-grade enriched uranium reserve to a level that cannot be used to make a nuclear bomb.

It is understood that over the past three months Iran has diluted 155kg of its higher-grade uranium gas - less than the 250kg necessary to build a bomb.

As a result of Iran's compliance the United States' government has began moves to release $450 million of Iranian funds frozen since the crisis began.

Western governments feared that former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (pictured) wanted his country to develop nuclear weapons. Here, Ahmadinejad is visiting the Natanz Uranium Enrichment facility in April 2008

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said 'all sides have kept committments made' as a result of the agreement.

Western diplomatic sources said that the election of Hassan Rouhani as Iranian president has enabled progress following years of strife while Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in charge.

Experts said that development means Iran has substantially less 20 percent enriched uranium that is required to build a nuclear warhead.

Last year, Iran had almost 200kg of this material which was approaching the 250kg necessary to build a bomb. Â 

Western governments had feared that Iran wanted to develop its own nuclear deterrent bringing further instability to the Middle East
