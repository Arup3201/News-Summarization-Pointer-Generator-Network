Arrested: Joseph Martino, 34, was charged with criminal posession of a weapon and reckless endangerment when police found about 40 explosive devices in his apartment

A New York man found with an arsenal of weapons in his apartment was arrested Thursday night after an explosion when he reportedly tried to dry materials for a pipe bomb in his oven.

Joseph Martino, 34, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment when police found about 40 explosive devices and materials in his apartment, according to 13WHAM-TV. Police said bomb-making was just Martino's hobby.

Police arrived at Martino's Springwater, N.Y., apartment shortly after 8 p.m. when neighbors called 911 upon hearing an explosion. Police said damage from the explosion was limited to Martino's oven, where he was trying to dry materials he intended to use to make a pipe bomb.

Police believe Martino was manufacturing homemade explosives in several objects. 

'Some were pipe bomb, but there were also pill bottles and large pill bottles. Anything that he could put an explosive in,' Livingston County Undersheriff James Szczesniak said, according to The Livingston County News.

Szczesniak said the Sheriff's Office hadn't had much prior contact with Martino. 

'We are still try to determine the reason behind the activity and the quantity,' he said.

Martino was being evicted from his apartment, 'but we have no indication he was trying to destroy the building', Szczesniak said according to the Associated Press.

Police said the scene was not rendered safe until 1 p.m. Friday afternoon because of the explosive devices and ingredients they found in the apartment.

Mill Street, where Martino's apartment is located, was closed off from traffic until 2:30 p.m. Friday.

Residents of Martino's apartment building were evacuated along with six homes nearby. They were expected to return home Friday afternoon.

Authorities detonated some of Martino's explosives in a secluded rural field in Springwater later on Friday because they were 'extremely volatile'.

In addition to the pipe bombs, explosive materials and firearms found in Martino's home, several jars of the chemical TATP were recovered at the scene, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told WHAM. TATP is a form of acetone peroxide Martino could have purchased at a drugstore, though the chemical is also commonly associated with terror groups.

Police don't believe Martino is affiliated with any groups, but they said they found more materials in another storage site in Livingston County.

Martino has a criminal history, but it does not involve explosives and police would not give further details.

Martino was arraigned and remanded to the county jail without bail.
