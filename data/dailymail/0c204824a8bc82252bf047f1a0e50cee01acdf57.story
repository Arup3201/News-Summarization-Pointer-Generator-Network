Clarke Carlisle's wife has expressed her gratitude after Burnley announced there would be a minute's applause for her hospital-bound husband in their Boxing Day game against Liverpool at Turf Moor.

The former Premier League defender and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chairman is in hospital after being involved in a collision with a lorry in North Yorkshire on Monday.

Carlisle's wife Gemma said her husband was 'very poorly' but 'alive and stable' after he underwent surgery on Tuesday.

Burnley have aranged a minute's applause for Carlisle at their Boxing Day game against Liverpool

Carlisle played for Burnley for five years, one of which came during the Clarets' first spell in the Barclays Premier League.

As a sign of support for their former player, the club announced this week that fans would clap in the fifth minute of their game against the Reds on Friday.

The fifth minute was chosen as it correlates with the squad number Carlisle wore during his time at the club.

On Christmas Eve, Gemma Carlisle tweeted her thanks to the Lancashire club.

'@BurnleyOfficial I really appreciate all the kind wishes & thoughts. Clarke and I will always have Burnley in our hearts. 05,' she wrote.

She also thanked a number of Carlisle's other clubs, including Blackpool, QPR, Watford, Leeds, and Northampton for their messages of support since Carlisle was admitted to hospital.

'Thank you each and everyone if you. I'm trying to read all messages. £blackpoolfc £qpr £watfordfc £lufc £bufc £ntfc,' she posted.

On Tuesday Carlisle's partner took to Twitter said she had been 'overwhelmed' by all the support she had received and gave an update on the ex-England Under-21 international's condition.

She said: 'Clarke's very poorly but he's alive and stable. Best Christmas gift we as a family could wish for. Thanks again.'

Representatives from the PFA visited Carlisle in hospital on Tuesday, and in a short statement the organisation said: 'Everyone at the PFA is keeping Clarke Carlisle in their prayers and thoughts.

'We visited Clarke at the hospital yesterday and we are offering our full help and support to him and his family at this difficult time.'

North Yorkshire Police would not confirm that Carlisle was involved in the accident but said a 35-year-old man was airlifted to hospital after a serious incident involving a lorry and a pedestrian on the A64, near York, on Monday morning.

The force launched a witness appeal following the incident, which occurred near the village of Bishopthorpe at 7.30am.

A statement said: 'The collision involved a male pedestrian and a lorry.

'The injured man has been airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary with serious injuries.

'The road was closed to allow the air ambulance to land and to allow collision investigators to examine the scene.'

Carlisle regularly appears on television as a commentator and pundit and has also been a contestant on the long-running Channel 4 quiz show Countdown and a guest on the BBC's Question Time.

He has also presented a TV documentary about racism in the game and another - Football's Suicide Secret - about mental health issues among his fellow professionals
