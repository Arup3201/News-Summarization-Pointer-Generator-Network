Owner Rich Ricci is planning a power-packed dual raid at Kempton on Boxing Day with Willie Mullins-trained duo Faugheen and Champagne Fever.

As expected, Champagne Fever runs in the William Hill King George VI Chase but Ricci has revealed the Christmas Hurdle is his 'preferred target' for unbeaten Faugheen, winner of last season's Neptune Investment Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival as well as being successful at Ascot last month.

That potentially sets up an absorbing clash with Paul Nicholls-trained Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Irving and, possibly, The New One if all goes well for him in Saturday's International Hurdle at Cheltenham.

Ricci said: 'I have a lot of respect for Irving but the Christmas Hurdle seems a good race for us. That is my preferred target.

'Christmas at Leopardstown will be another re-match between Hurricane Fly and Jezki and I am not keen to take those guys on too quickly.'

The King George will be a first try at three miles for Champagne Fever, the 2013 Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner.

He won the Clonmel Oil Chase on his comeback last month and Ricci revealed the Mullins-team are keen to have him as fresh as possible for the King George after learning from his defeat in last season's Arkle Chase at Cheltenham.

Ricci said: 'I had a conversation with Ruby (Walsh) and Willie afterwards and they thought they had done too much work with him.

'This season we have kept him fresher. He is certainly bred to stay and we have every hope he will win. He is in great form.'

Meanwhile, Charlie Morlock, assistant to trainer Nicky Henderson, says there is growing optimism that Simonsig could make the race after his long absence.

Morlock said: 'There is still work to do and it is an upward curve but if there are no more kinks along the way there is a good chance.'
