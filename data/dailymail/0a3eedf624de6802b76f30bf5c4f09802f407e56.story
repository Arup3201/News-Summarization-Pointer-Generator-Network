Sony producers censored The Interview when they released the controversial movie last week, editing out at least on racy scene depicting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un participating in a gay orgy.  

The scene was described in a version of the  film's script, which was released online in a hack on the Sony production company, but did not appear in the film released online and in a few small movie theaters.

The hack is believed to have been carried out by a group with ties to the North Korean regime, which threatened action against Sony if they released the movie critical of their leader.

Racy: A ten-minute gay orgy scene was edited out of the version of The Interview which was released last week.

Fears: Sony initially decided not to release the film, afraid of threatened '9/11-style' terrorist attacks on movie theaters. After a free speech campaign, they decided to release the film online and in limited theaters. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (right) condemned President Obama for encouraging the film's release

Sony staff who spoke with The Sunday Times called the version released last week a 'redacted version' and expressed hopes that the full unedited movie would be released on DVD in a 'director's cut version'. 

The movie stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as two hapless journalists tasked with 'taking out' Kim Jong-un after they secure a TV interview with the feared dictator. 

The attention brought to the movie over the hack and it's initial cancellation by Sony, drove traffic to independent movie theaters and online when the company changed their mind and decided to release it on Christmas Eve.  On opening day, the movie grossed $1million.

Among other details edited from the film include North Korean military insignia, which was originally visible on soldiers' uniforms in the film. 

But the most controversial and wide-sweeping edit was the removal of a 10-minute scene depicting the aftermath of a gay orgy between Kim Jong-un (played by Korean-American actor Randall Park) and the television presenter Dave Skylark played by Franco.

According to the leaked script, the scene was subtle. 

'Dave and Kim are in a bed naked, with the four women,' it reads. 'They’re all playing MORTAL KOMBAT.'

In the edited film, a more toned down scene involving the new friends shows them playing around with scantily clad women.  

Another scene that did not appear in the film was a conversation between Rogen and Franco about Kim Jong-un's sexual abilities.   

Erased: The edited version also saw North Korean military insignia on soldiers uniforms erased 

'Moreover, he is champion at fellatio,' says Rogen's character to Franco's character in the script.

'He can suck a 12 inch c**k while ice-skating backwards.' 

Over the weekend, the North Korean regime spewed racial slurs at President Obama as they blamed him for the movie's release. President Obama encouraged Sony to release the film in defense of free speech. 

'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest,' a spokesman for North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement. 

President Obama has promised retaliation for the hack against Sony, but it's still unclear what punishment will entail.
