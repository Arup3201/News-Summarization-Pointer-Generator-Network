David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s rose garden love-in has been branded ‘sick-inducing’ by a former Lib Dem adviser.

Julia Goldsworthy, who has now quit the Treasury to try to win back a seat in Parliament, said activists would have been appalled at the sight of the Tory and Lib Dem leaders ‘hamming it up’ in the sunshine after the coalition was formed in 2010.

She also revealed Chancellor George Osborne warned Treasury insiders that if they did anything to undermine the Government ‘you will be out of here faster than your legs can carry you’.

Unity: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Tory David Cameron used the press conference in the Number 10 garden to present the first coalition in Britain since the war

Laughs: At one point Mr Cameron was reminded that when once asked what his favourite political joke was, he replied: 'Nick Clegg'

The bonhomie was supposed to show that two parties can work well together, but it was stomach-churning for party activists

After
 months of internal battling over policy priorities, the Tories and Lib 
Dems want to use the Budget this week to present a united front.

Mr
 Cameron and Mr Clegg are expected to appear together in public again 
before Mr Osborne sets out his economic plans in the Commons on 
Wednesday.

But the public 
displays of unity have left Lib Dem activists in particularly anxious 
that they risk being seen as an annex of the Tory party.

Miss Goldsworthy lost her Camborne and Redruth in 2010 to Tory George Eustice by just 66 votes.

Like
 many Lib Dems she was uncomfortable watching the infamous joint press 
conference between Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg in the garden of Downing 
Street.

Happier times: In the May sunshine of 2010, both party leaders were keen to show how well they got on

Threshold: Four years after the bonhomie, both parties are now battling to take credit for key policies, including cutting income tax for low earners

Sharing jokes, 
exchanging meaningful glances and referring to each other chummily as 
Nick and David, they couldn't have looked happier.

At one point Mr Cameron was reminded by a journalist that he had once described his Mr Clegg as 'my favourite political joke'.

But such was the mood of the moment that Mr Clegg, after a theatrical show of mock offence, readily agreed to forgive and forget.

Former Lib Dem MP Julia Golsdworthy said both parties had to show that the coalition could work

Miss Goldsworthy said: ‘I sat at home watching Nick and David in their first press conference in the Rose Garden.

‘I think probably for a lot of political activists it was quite sick-inducing, but it was absolutely necessary because of the economy and national interest,’ she told the Independent on Sunday.

‘Coalition was a fairly new thing to get our heads around. It was fairly important to demonstrate that this was a relationship that could work. It was fairly important to ham it up at the start, to show that this was something that was going to last.’

Miss Goldsworthy first became an MP in 2005, and quickly joined the Lib Dem frontbench under Charles Kennedy, and later Sir Menzies Campbell and Nick Clegg.

Once tipped as a future leader, she took party in Channel 4 reality TV show The Games but was caught up in the expenses scandal after claiming £1,200 for a pink rocking chair for upmarket store Heal's.

Within weeks of losing her seat in May 2010 she 
landed a job as a spin doctor for Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny 
Alexander – a job she had shadowed in opposition.

She added: ‘Danny and the Chancellor have
 said… because economic stability so crucial, the Treasury is the 
department where the Coalition more than anywhere else has to work.

‘George
 has always been very, very clear to anyone coming in to the Treasury, 
he told any ministers and advisers, this is the department where the 
coalition has to work: ‘If I catch you doing anything to undermine the 
Government you will be out of here faster than your legs can carry 
you”.’

However, the two parties are locked in a very public battle over taking credit for income tax cuts.

The Lib Dems promised at the 2010 election to increase the amount workers can earn before paying tax to £10,000.

After losing her seat at the 2010 election, Julia Goldsworthy became an adviser for Lib Dem Danny Alexander (right) but was warned by Chancellor George Osborne against undermining the coalition

Before the election the Tories said it was unaffordable but it became the flagship personal tax cut of the coalition.

Since then Mr Osborne has sought to gain the advantage by claiming the cut – worth £700 to basic rate taxpayers – as a Conservative policy.

However, an opinion poll last week showed 45 per cent of voters think the Lib Dems deserve most credit for this policy, well ahead of the Tories on 33 per cent.

In Wednesday’s Budget Mr Osborne is expected to increase the threshold to £10,500, which Mr Clegg has dubbed a ‘workers’ bonus’ worth £100 a year.
