An eco-shack built from scratch out of recycled material with an allotment on the roof was today crowned Britain’s top shed.

Joel Bird, 39, in Tottenham, north London, used recycled materials to construct his Allotment Roof Shed - and grows an array of vegetables on top.

It is powered by a solar panel and a wood burner keeps the inside warm in winter as Mr Bird paints and makes music in his specially-designed studio.

Winner: Joel Bird, 39, in Tottenham, north London, used recycled materials to construct his Allotment Roof Shed - and grows an array of vegetables on top

Resourceful: Mr Bird used old aluminium windows and doors when he replaced them in his house and also made the most of old carpet, tyres and pallets

Garden escape: With plenty of greenery and an old metal tub on the roof to bathe in, Mr Bird said his shed is a mini countryside which keeps him sane in a city

He grows potatoes, courgettes, leeks, beetroot, onions, carrots, garlic, asparagus, tomatoes, rhubarb and strawberries on top of his shed.

Mr Bird even has a tin bath on the roof. He said he spent about £500 creating his winning entry.

He used old aluminium windows and doors when he replaced them in his house and also relied on old carpet, tyres and pallets.

Mr Bird took the soil for the allotment roof from beneath the base of the shed.

Excess water flows off the roof through a pipe and waters his herbs wall before being collected in a water butt to be re-used.

Mr Bird said: ‘I began building my shed five years ago and just had a grass roof.

'But around a year ago I added the allotment, which is what makes my shed most special.

‘I was tight for space, so rather than put a shed on an allotment, I put an allotment on my shed. I am up there every single day. 

Smoke machine: DJs Paddy Bickerton and Aidan Larkin, both 35 and from the Cotswolds, won the normal shed category for their Disco Shed

Tribal touches: Small mementos from trips away and Moroccan tapestry cushions decorate this back garden retreat. The roof is lined with pink and purple folded voile

‘When I am not sitting or gardening up
 there I am working in the shed. I actually spend more time on or in the
 shed than in the house.

‘My
 partner would say that the shed is my domain but I think of it as a 
family shed.

‘It's great to work knowing it gives me a really high level of sustainability. The lights are powered by a solar panel, I use a wood burner to heat it - and then there is the allotment roof.

'It’s easy to access with a little staircase and I have a little tin bath up there for a summer soak.

Bunk beds: Jamie Dix and Gemma Mitchell were the garden office shed winners for their thatched roof creation The Little Thatch

'It
 has been amazing being up there this summer with all the good weather.

'It’s a little mini countryside which keeps me sane in a city.

'Sheds
 are no longer just places for men to escape to. They are transforming 
the way people live their lives and subsequently how they see 
themselves.

‘It’s an 
incredible honour for my shed to be crowned Shed of the Year and I’m 
hoping to use the award to promote the benefits of a more sustainable 
life.’

Mr Bird received a £1,000 cash prize along with a giant crown and winner’s plaque for his shed.
