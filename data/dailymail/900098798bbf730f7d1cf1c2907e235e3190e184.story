A mother-of-two whose cancer left her bed-bound for two years found a way to stay positive - by writing erotic fiction.  

Jayne Allen, 56, was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2008 and was operated on immediately after doctors found a tumour smothering her whole kidney.

After having the affected kidney removed, Jayne was left with a number of other health problems which confined her to her bed for several years.

Jayne Allen was left house bound for years after being diagnosed with kidney cancer, in a bid to keep herself busy she turned her hand to erotic fiction 

The care worker from Coventry was forced to quit her job as she was in too much pain to leave the house.  

In a bid to distract herself from her poor health, she picked up E L James's hit book Fifty Shade of Grey.

It was while reading the bestseller that Jayne decided that she fancied having a go at writing her own naughty novel, adding that she thought she could show E L James a thing or two. 

'I was doing it for myself, to begin with, because of a desire to do something shocking. I started the novel and had written 50,000 words within the first month. It's a bloody thriller full of sex and revenge, so I had a lot of fun writing it.' 

Her book It's A Secret has proved popular online and in bookshops selling hundreds of copies - as well as helping Jayne put her cancer battle behind her.

As well as her writing providing her solace, Jayne found her husband to be a great support throughout her cancer battle.

Jayne was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 and although she didn't have to have chemotherapy her operation meant she was bed-bound for most of the time

Jayne's husband Bill suggested she started writing after reading his wife's diaries 

Jayne married second husband Bill, 57, in 2008 and they had just begun decorating their new home together when Jayne began to experience pain in her side. 

'After my operation, I found I couldn't move or walk or do anything for a couple of years, so through sheer boredom I decided to write something.

'I thought if EL James could do it, then I could do it. I hadn't read it cover to cover but I couldn't believe how popular it was. And I'd heard it wasn't especially well written so I thought I could do better.'

Jayne quickly found that writing her novel was just what she needed to keep her positive and made progress very quickly. 

'They removed the kidney the following month and thankfully I didn't have to have chemotherapy because they'd found the tumour just in time. It was a slow-growing cancer, but I had MRI scans every few months to ensure the cancer hadn't spread.'

Despite remaining cancer-free, Jayne has been left with numerous health problems including disequilibrium syndrome, which she nicknames 'old lady syndrome' as it leaves her with loss of balance and severe fatigue.

With Jayne housebound since leaving her job as a care worker in 2009, it was Bill - a car maintenance officer for the police - who suggested she take up writing. 

Jayne bought Fifty Shades of Grey and decided that she could do better than author E L James 

Jayne occasionally includes her own sexual experiences with husband Bill (pictured) in her novels 

The couple were heartbroken when a routine MRI scan revealed the tumour covering her whole kidney.

Jayne, who has two grown-up children from her previous marriage, says the cancer came as a massive shock to them both.  

'Bill is my soulmate. We were like any loved-up newlyweds that year despite being in our late 40s - we both felt we had a new lease of life having married each other.

'After our house move I started getting a lot of pain and discomfort in my side so my GP referred me for an MRI scan. 

'I don't think at that point they were actually looking for cancer, just attempting to find out what was wrong. But it turned out my tumour was quite advanced and had covered my whole right kidney.' 

She said: 'Some days I couldn't leave the house as my mobility was so badly affected. I needed something to take my mind off the pain and boredom. I'd let Bill read some of my old diaries a few months earlier and he thought they were great, so the novel was all his idea.

Before starting It's A Secret Jayne experimented with several other genres before deciding on a more sensual story line.  

'I dabbled with other genres and wrote some poetry, and in 2011 I started working on my erotic novel.

Jayne says she has received hugely positive feedback about her book and even her children have read it 

'The eroticism in It's A Secret is mostly wishful thinking, like me wanting to join the Mile High Club. I put that in as a little teaser for myself. I had a lot of fun with it. 

'I was shocked at myself that I would put such raunchy details into the book. I was trying to write things that would help my readers feel all the different pleasures of having sex, the same that I felt writing it.'

As well as fantasies, Jayne included a number of experiences from her own sex life in the novel.

'Certain scenes do reflect mine and Bill's relationship. But I wouldn't put everything in the book, as some things are private. I do draw the line. 

'Thankfully Bill doesn't mind me including bits about him, although of course he's the only one who knows which bits they are.'

Jayne added that her and Bill have always enjoyed  an erotic relationship and the novel has helped to unite them further. 

Jayne has now sold hundreds of copies of her book It's a Secret and is currently writing a sequel 

'I once painted Bill in the nude so I suppose we've always been a very sensual couple. I wanted to put the painting up on the wall but he wouldn't let me. 

'The novel has brought us closer together and although he can't believe it was me who wrote it, he is so proud. Apparently I am sexier than I have ever been!'

Jayne says that her children have been equally supportive of her writing: 'I have grown-up children and my daughter has read It's A Secret and thinks it's great. She loves what I'm doing.'

The mother-of-two says that she has seen the landscape of sexual liberation completely change and that we are lucky to be able to enjoy books like hers. 

'Women have always been suppressed when it comes to sex. You are a slut if you sleep around, or not a very nice woman if you want sex.

'But women are more accepted now. If you want sex, go out and get it. If you just want a one-night stand it is acceptable and that's how it should be. In my mum's day you could have been stoned for reading a book like this. Equality isn't quite there, but we are working on it.'

Jayne published It's A Secret in 2012 through self-publishing firm AuthorHouse UK and it's available to buy in major bookshops and online.

The book's blurb states: 'If you want a fast moving compelling, bloody sexual erotic experience, then come inside this fantasy. It is full of want and need, passion and hatred. Mostly, revenge is sweet but what comes with the before and after? Feelings of so many wants, needs, mistrust and rage. Read me, I'm yours.'

Jayne says she has been thrilled with the positive response her novel has received so far and plans to continue writing.  

'The book is gradually becoming well-known. I do book signings when I can. It's become more and more popular and I've had people contact me on Facebook demanding that I write a sequel, so that's what I'm in the middle of now. The sequel's called It's a Secret Too.

'Writing keeps me sane. I have just been signed off work for another two years, but knowing I have this to work on helps me to stay positive. I've managed to create something fun and exciting out of a very hard situation - excuse the pun!'
