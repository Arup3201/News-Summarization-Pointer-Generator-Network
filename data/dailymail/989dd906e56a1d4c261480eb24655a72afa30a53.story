A street in America has ramped up the voltage when it comes to Christmas lights and synced their bulbs to music.

Sixteen neighbors living on Manning Street in Yucaipa, California, spent months preparing the impressive decorations adorning their homes and front yards.

Resident Jeff Maxey uploaded an aerial video yesterday showing the lights in action, with thousands of ornaments flashing in time to Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You.

Bolts of yellow, blue, red and green illuminate the night sky as the track plays. 

Car headlamps add to the effect as vehicles drive through the spectacle.

The lights have also been rigged up to dance to dozens of other tracks including the  rock track Wizards of Winter by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. 

It is the fourth year that the people of Yucaipa have come together to put on a festive display.

‘We want everyone to enjoy the show and all the hard work we put into making this better every year,’ they said on their Facebook page. 

The dancing lights run from dusk to 9pm Sunday through Thursday and until 10pm on Friday and Saturday.

Don't forget your sunglasses!
