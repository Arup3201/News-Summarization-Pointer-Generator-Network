He lived a life of solitude on the streets for more than ten years.

Now, five months after the homeless man known only as Andy died, police have shared pictures of his faded tattoos in a last ditch attempt at identifying him.

Detectives are pleading for anyone related to the ‘gentle giant’, who spent a decade living by a riverside bench in Pyrmont in Sydney’s inner west, to come forward so that he can receive a proper burial.

In the photos released by Sydney City police, a tattoo of a viking is shown on his right shoulder. On his left shoulder a demon sits with the words ‘death to the world’ and ‘search and destroy’.

Another blurry inking on his fingers spells out the word ‘hate’.

This was Andy's favourite spot - Jacksons Landing, the northern tip of Pyrmont which is in Sydney's inner-city suburb

Crime manager with Sydney City LAC, John Maricic told Daily Mail Australia that police have not received any new information about Andy so far.

Officers are not even certain that his real name is Andy.

A month after Andy, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, died from a heart attack on August 28 nearly 200 locals paid their respects at his memorial service.

The man of few words slept in front of Raine and Horne's real estate agency in Pyrmont but spent his days on a bench in Jacksons Landing - the northern tip of the inner-city surburb - overlooking Sydney Harbour.

Principal of Raine and Horne Pyrmont, John Ellis, helped fund the service which was held near Andy's bench.

'It was the obvious thing to do - he's human too,' Mr Ellis told Daily Mail Australia.

'He didn't bother the staff at all because he was polite and very respectful. He didn't ask for anything and didn't say much.

'He was a homeless person but he didn't act like one. He never drank, never smoked and just liked to keep to himself and draw in his notepad. He was a gentle giant.

'He didn't make much eye contact and he was quite shy.'

After he died locals announced plans to place a plaque at his bench in his honour while a basket hung from a nearby tree where residents have left behind their tributes. They include children's drawings of Andy enjoying the views of the harbour from his bench.

Mr Ellis said Andy had been sleeping outside the Raine and Horne office for about seven years while other locals speculated that he'd lived in the area for more than a decade.

Reverend Robin Davies, of Mustard Seed Uniting Church in Ultimo, said there was a huge sense of loss in the community when Andy died.

A memorial service, also organised by residents, was held near Andy's bench in September

'There was a great outpouring of grief for Andy because he was part of our community,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'So the memorial service was an opportunity for the locals to express their thoughts.

'I guess some people even felt guilty because he was so young.'

Reverend Davies said it is believed that Andy was from Queensland.

'But some people reckon he's lived in the area for 15 years,' she said.

'He seemed to feel at home and quite secure here. He was just quite happy with what he had and people respected and admired him for that. The community accepted him just as he was.'

Andy's body remains at a morgue, waiting to be claimed by a relative.

If nobody comes forward, Reverend Davies said the community is willing to cremate him and scatter his ashes into the water in front of his favourite bench.

But Crime Manager Maricic told the Daily Telegraph that decision on how Andy would be buried will be decided by the coroner if no family members come forward.

‘If nothing further comes to light once the coroner makes his findings he will then determine what course of action will take place in terms of a destitute burial,’ he said. 

Nearly 200 locals paid their respects to the homeless man, who's identity remains a mystery but is believed to be from Queensland
