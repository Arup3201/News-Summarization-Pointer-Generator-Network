Hillary Clinton has been spotted at the annual Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua, New York which she has attended almost every year since buying a house in the area after her husband left the White House.

She was the only member of her family to attend today's event but what she lacked in numbers she made up for in spirit as she was wearing a patriotic outfit.

The former Secretary of State and expected Democratic presidential nominee wore a casual navy suit, a straw hat and a flowing stars-and-stripes scarf.

Political posturing: Westchester county executive-turned-gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino shared this photo with the former Secretary of State at the Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua today

Buzzfeed reporter Ruby Cramer was at the parade and posted a message on Twitter saying that Mrs Clinton did not appear to have any staffers accompanying her throughout the parade.

She added that it only looked as if Clinton had one visible security guard.

She walked much of the way alongside Rob Astorino, the county executive for Westchester which encompasses Chappaqua.

Spending time with a local politician at a local event would not raise any concerns normally but the pairing is particularly unusual at the moment since he is running for governor against Andrew Cuomo, who previously served as former President Clinton's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

Mrs Clinton has spoken in the past about how she enjoys the Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua and tells her aides to try to make sure that she is able to attend in spite of her busy schedule.

Waving to the crowd: The Clintons are regulars at town events since buying a home in the New York City suburb in 2000 after leaving the White House

Obliging: Mrs Clinton arrived 20 minutes early and happily spoke to residents, posing for dozens of photos

'I put this on my calendar every year, and I basically tell my staff I really, really, really want to do this,' Mrs Clinton told The New York Times in 2012- months before stepping down as Secretary of State.

'Unless there’s some crisis of significant proportions, I’ll be here, and I’ve had a few crises where I’ve had to take phone calls as I’ve marched. Next week I’m going to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, but I said, "That is going to happen after Memorial Day, no matter what."'

The Clintons bought a $1.7million home
 in the New York City suburb in 2000 and, at the time, it was widely 
considered a strategic move since it allowed her to run for Senate in 
New York.

Since then, the 
political power couple have routinely impressed their neighbors by 
ingratiating themselves with the community by supporting local 
businesses and attending events like the Memorial Day parade.

Crowds
 of locals and visitors alike took pictures of Mrs Clinton at today's 
parade and she reportedly got to the parade early so that she could 
spend 20 minutes talking to residents before the parade officially 
started.

Back in the day: The Clintons have made a point of attending the parade every year since they moved into the area in 2000 (pictured at the 2007 parade when she was a Senator of New York)

Representing: She said that her husband (pictured at the 2007 parade) was not able to make it this year because he is in Sweden
