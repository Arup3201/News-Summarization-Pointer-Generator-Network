A 23-month-old girl cannot eat after she was born with her intestines growing on the outside of her body.

Georgia Diamond has never enjoyed a bite of food, as a result of the crippling bowel condition, gastroschisis.

She is fed by a tube directly into her stomach, and has to carry a back-pack containing a line of medicine and food.

Georgia has faced multiple operations since she was born, to try and correct the problem, but she will only be able to eat properly once she has had an intestine transplant.

As soon as she was born, doctors began to treat Georgia's condition. In her short life, the 23-month-old has had multiple operations to push her intestines back inside her abdomen and close the abdominal wall

But the toddler, who lives in Newport in South Wales, will have to wait at least another two years before experts at Birmingham Children's Hospital can attempt the procedure.

The hospital is one of only two in the world where the operation is available.

Georgia's mother, Lisa James, 26, said: 'We are desperately hoping to find a way to feed her as she needs to be tube fed at the moment.'

Georgia's gastroschisis meant Miss James was unable to breastfeed her daughter.

And instead of starting to eat solids when other babies would, the toddler has been fed through a tube through her nose since birth.

For the first 14 months of her life, home for Georgia was the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales.

In June, doctors tried to stimulate her bowel to work by narrowing it.

But the 23-month-old still has two tubes taking nutrients directly to her stomach and small intestine.

A gastrostomy tube replaced the tube in her nose and a Jejunal tube goes direct to her intestine.

She has had seven operations and managed to return home to Miss James and her father Scott Diamond last November.

But unfortunately the operation to fit the tubes in June was unsuccessful and MIss James said they are ‘back to square one'.

'She is still not feeding so we are going back to Birmingham next week for tests to see why it didn’t work,' she said.

'She is comfortable at hospital and still goes to Cardiff’s Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales for check ups as well as going to Birmingham for surgery.

'We are hoping to find a way to feed her as she needs to be tube fed. If we can do that then we can progress from there.

'We are hoping that it will be this month or next or in the spring at the latest but it just depends in what they find and as they will be doing lots of different tests and she may require and operation - we are going in completely blind.'

But Miss James remains positive and said that on the whole Georgia is doing really well.

'She is doing well and will be starting playgroup,' she said.

'She is at home but still loves the hospital - every time she goes she seems to pick up more things.

'I think it is helping her to come on with her development as she is speaking loads.'

Doctors have told Miss James her daughter will require an intestines transplant, if she hopes to feed normally

Gastroschisis is a type of abdominal wall defect that occurs when a child's intestines do not develop fully while in the womb.

In the early stages of pregnancy, the intestine develops within the umbilical cord. Weeks later it moves inside the foetus' abdomen.

But where an unborn child has gastroschisis, the abdominal wall does not completely form.It results in the intestines growing outside the body.

Around one in 3,000 babies are born with the condition in the UK, each year.

As soon as the child is born the condition requires immediate treatment.

Within a few hours of birth, the baby is usually transferred to a specialist children's hospital.

The first step is for doctor's to wrap the exposed intestines in a type of 'cling film' to reduce the amount of fluid and body heat lost. It also acts to protect the intestines from further damage.

Once a baby is stable, they will have an operation to put the intestines back inside the abdomen, and close up the abdominal wall.

It can take several operations to achieve this, placing the intestines back a bit at a time, until they can all be contained.

For some children, their intestines will recover and start to work properly, allowing them to begin to eat normally.

For other children, the intestines can experience too much damage during the process, meaning further treatment is required.
