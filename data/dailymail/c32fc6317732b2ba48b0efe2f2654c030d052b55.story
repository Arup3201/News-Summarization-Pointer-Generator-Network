Labour will reduce Britain to an economic basket case like France if it wins the election, a leading investment bank warned last night.

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said it would lead to lower growth, and seriously damage investor confidence in the UK.

In a devastating assessment, the world’s fourth-largest investment bank told clients that under a weak Ed Miliband government, possibly propped up by the SNP and Greens, the UK would ‘look increasingly like France’, where growth is almost non-existent and unemployment is almost double the level in the UK.

The report said: ‘A Left-wing coalition around Labour, would, in our view, continue to deliver on fiscal austerity, albeit a milder version than the Tories, with the accompanying cyclical headwind that this entails, while embarking on structural changes which could in the medium run reduce the appeal of the UK as a business location and trigger, ultimately, a deterioration in potential GDP growth.

‘In a nutshell, the UK would look increasingly like France.’ The warning is acutely embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who cosied up to France’s socialist President Francois Hollande after his 2012 victory.

At the time, Mr Miliband said the two men were ‘in agreement’ on the economy, and suggested he was looking to replicate the French anti-austerity programme.

But Mr Hollande’s socialist experiment, which included a 75 per cent top tax rate, has proved a disaster. Economic growth in the final quarter was 0.1 per cent in France, compared with 0.5 per cent in the UK. Unemployment is 9.9 per cent – way above the 5.8 per cent in the UK.

The BAML report warned that Mr Miliband is likely to ‘seriously interfere with the private sector’, adding that, with the public finances still in a mess, Labour may revert to bashing business in order to fund its pledges.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the report showed the danger posed by the Labour Party

‘If a centre-Left government cannot tackle inequality through social transfers, it will be tempted to focus on fighting “primary inequality”, for instance by imposing a massive increase in the minimum wage,’ said the report. ‘In our estimates, Labour’s pledge to bring this to £8 per hour would put the UK at the level where France is, in terms of distance from the median wage.

‘Re-regulation of working contracts and working time would also be likely. The “energy price freeze” – mooted by Labour last year – and the proposals to introduce a market share cap in the banking sector are other examples of interference with the private sector.’

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said the report underlined the threat posed by Labour.

‘Labour have no plan for the economy, other than more spending, more borrowing and more taxes,’ he said. ‘The choice is clear – between a competent Conservative government working through its long-term economic plan and the chaos of Labour with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.’
