Downing Street faces more flak over company tax arrangements after it emerged that a major Government contractor is funnelling profits into an offshore haven.

Telereal Trillium has a £3.2 billion contract to manage buildings such as job centres for the Department for Work and Pensions. It also manages property used by the DVLA.

While the company paid full UK corporation tax last year, it funnelled £163 million of its post-tax profits in the form of share dividends into a parent company based in the British Virgin Islands where there  is a zero rate of income and corporation tax.

Since 2010, the Trillium group has given £673 million in share payments to its offshore owner.

Last year’s financial accounts reveal that the company has links to a secretive arrangement of shell companies, the very structure that David Cameron has described as ‘shadowy’ and has vowed to eradicate.

Last night Ian Austin, the Shadow Minister for Work and Pensions, said: ‘People will be staggered to learn that a company paid by the Government ploughs its profits through a well-known tax haven.’

And Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, said:  ‘The Government says it is committed to transparency. That means it should only buy from companies in places where we can find out who the real owners are, which you can’t in the British Virgin Islands.’

The Prime Minister yesterday met leaders from Crown Dependencies, including  the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, who agreed to an ‘automatic exchange’ deal for tax information.

A spokesman for Telereal Trillium said: ‘The Department for Work and Pensions and DVLA are aware of our structure, and these are very long-standing clients.’

The Department for Work and Pensions declined to comment.
