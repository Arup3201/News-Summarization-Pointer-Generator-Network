It is hard to believe this shy-looking schoolgirl in her pigtails and glasses, pictured above left, would become one of the world’s greatest sex symbols. 

But this is one of the first-ever photographs of legendary French screen beauty Brigitte Bardot.

The intimate family snap is among dozens of rare photographs of the star featured in a major new book on her life and career.

Pictured in 1952, the Paris-born actress became a fantasy figure for men across the globe 

The young Bardot may have regarded herself as ugly, but within a few short years of this picture being taken she would be a fantasy figure for men across the globe.

The Paris-born actress had already made 16 films before her starring role in Roger Vadim’s 1956 movie And God Created Woman turned her into an international icon. In 1969 she received the ultimate accolade when she was chosen as the first face of Marianne, symbol of the French Republic.

But the star grew tired of the movies and the celebrity, and she retired in 1973 after making more than 40 films. Now, just turned 80, Bardot devotes herself to her beloved animal rights causes.

The book, Brigitte Bardot: The Life, The Legend, The Movies, spans the entire course of her life and includes childhood photographs, never before seen shots of her on set, as well as more recent photographs of her enjoying her retirement.

Bardot insists she has never been comfortable with the beauty and fame that captivated the world and talks about this exclusively in a rare interview with Liz Jones in this weekend’s You magazine.

Brigitte Bardot: The Life, The Legend, The Movies, by Ginette Vincendeau, is published by Carlton on November 6 at £30.
