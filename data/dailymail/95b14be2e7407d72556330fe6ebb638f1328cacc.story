The drama is based on author George R. R. Martin book series A Song of Ice and Fire.

Visitors to London's new Game of Thrones exhibition will have to pledge their allegiance to a Great House before entering the show.

Guests will choose between the families of Stark, Arryn, Lannister, Greyjoy or the Night's Watch before entering.

The exhibition will also bring back one of last year’s most popular attractions—a virtual reality version of the White Wall.

Using a virtual reality headset, attendees can pretend to scale the 700ft wall of ice that features in the fantasy world.

However, the event is only available to Sky TV subscribers. Visitors can also attend if they are a guest of a SkyTV subscriber.

Photo stations will also allow fans to interact with the event, placing them in well-known locations from the series.

The fifth series of the programme will start in the UK on April 13, and will be broadcast on Sky Atlantic.
