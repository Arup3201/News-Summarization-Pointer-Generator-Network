In this video Neymar offers an insight into exactly what he gets up in his spare time with this fine piece of skill.

The Brazilian had recently sent a private jet to fly model Soraja Vucelic to Barcelona after the pair met in Ibiza, according to reports in Serbia. 

He helped Barcelona secure a 2-1 victory against Almeria in their most recent La Liga fixture, scoring the equaliser before Jordi Alba wrapped up all three points for his side.

Neymar was introduced after the break alongside Luis Suarez and his goal cancelled out former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma's opener.
