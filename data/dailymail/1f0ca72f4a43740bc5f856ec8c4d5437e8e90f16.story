They have already shown us how ordinary British families interact in front of the TV.

Now the makers of Gogglebox will give us a snapshot of how we spend our time in our kitchens.

The team behind the hit Channel 4 documentary have made a similar series charting the ways we cook and eat at home.

The team behind Gogglebox have visited several households across the UK to see what happens at dinnertime. Here Solicitor Alasdair lives with wife Lucy, a luxury tour operator, and their three children in Gloucestershire, they prefer luxury home cooked cuisine

From the aristocrat who serves roadkill to his young family, to the Welsh family who survive on frozen meals from Iceland, the BBC2 show reveals the stark differences in what food we prepare.

One of the stars of the show is graphic designer Hamish Mitchell Cotts. Despite being born into a life of privilege, the 63-year-old – whose father was an Army major and a baronet – gave up the chance of a lucrative career in London to raise his six children in rural Suffolk.

He and his wife Merlyn, 48, survive on a £100-a-week food budget, forcing them to adopt the techniques of ‘medieval peasants’ and take vegetables from local fields to survive.

The have named each of their offspring - Celandine, 18, Tamarisk, 15, Campion, 14, 11-year-old twins Rowan and Valerian, and Samphire, eight – after plants found near their house, and they rely on local produce to feed them.

Hamish, the son of a baronet, and his South African wife Merlyn live in rural Suffolk with their six children (all named after plants). They have a far more frugal spread with a  budget of  £100 a week to feed the family

Mr Mitchell Cotts told the Daily Mail: ‘We try and make them understand that food isn’t just a shrink wrapped package from a supermarket. It’s a commodity that you’ve got to understand and look after.

‘I do see it as a challenge. I put a bit of effort into it. We look around to source our food. After the harvest wherever you go you see fields with thousands of potatoes or onions lying around. I nip in there once in a while and fill up a sack or a basket and that will last us a couple of months.

‘I see it as a time honoured custom. The farmers are not really too bothered. You’ve got to make sure you’re not trampling on crops.’

Mr Mitchell Cotts always buys the cheapest products from shops and supermarkets, and serves unpopular and cheap off-cuts of meat such as tripe and kidneys to his children.

And he admitted he has occasionally served up wild animals killed on the roads near his house, although he does so rarely because skinning and gutting the animals is so time-consuming.

He said: ‘We’re surrounded by forests, and wherever you go you see road kill. It’s unbelievable. I think road kill has its place. I’m not against it. I have prepared and eaten it in the past.

‘But in terms of feeding a family of eight it’s pretty impractical because you have to do an amazing amount of preparation, with skinning and gutting and so on.’

Marylyn and Wilf live in Devon. Marylyn enjoys making pasties for her husband who she has been married to for over 50 years

He added: ‘When I decided I wanted to have children, I made a conscious decision that I wasn’t going to spend my life working my socks off in some far off place.

‘I know people who get up at 5am, take the train to London, come back at 8pm and see their children for a few minutes. I didn’t want to do that. I have sacrificed a more lucrative existence by deciding to be in the country and stay in the country.’

The three-part documentary – called The Kitchen – features another family who take a very different approach to surviving on a tight budget.

Warehouse worker Lee Barry and his wife Louise Powers, set themselves a budget of around £200-a-week to feed their five children aged between eight and 19.

But instead of sourcing fresh vegetables, they do their weekly shop at Iceland and regularly eat sausages, chips and beans.

Mr Barry, from Cardiff, said he would be happy to eat road kill and collect vegetables from the fields if he did not live in the city.

He added: ‘I think it’s easier to eat cheaply when you live in the countryside. You don’t get a lot of road kill in Cardiff. Organic food is too expensive for us, so we tend to buy frozen stuff from Iceland. It keeps for longer and the kids like it.

‘We eat stuff like sausages, chips, and beans. We always try to sit down together for a Sunday roast, but it is hard feeding five kids as they all want different things and they are fussy eaters.’

Other stars of the show include pensioners Wilfred and Marylyn Bradshaw, who married 50 years ago after a whirlwind romance which started at the button factory where they worked.

The couple, from Devon, eat a traditional English diet of meat pies, mash and gravy, prepared meticulously by Mrs Bradshaw.

Lunch is always on the table at 12.30pm, and dinner is served at 5.30pm sharp so he can watch the Six O’Clock News.

Whenever they go on holiday or visit friends overnight, they always pack their own food – often consisting of cheese sandwiches - so they are not a burden on others and in case they cannot stomach the local cooking.

Recalling a disastrous trip to Italy, Mr Bradshaw said: ‘It was all pizza and pasta and things like that. It wasn’t very nice.’

Meanwhile, the middle-class Garbutt family, from Gloucestershire, are passionate about feeding their three children a healthy, organic diet.

Alistair Garbutt, a solicitor, tries to live off the land as much as possible, by growing vegetables on the allotment, catching his own fish, and getting fresh cuts of meat from his father-in-law’s hobby farm.

Their children Archie, 12, Harry, nine, and Daphne, seven, are encouraged to get involved with the cooking but it is not always easy to get them to finish their food. 

The Kitchen starts next Monday on BBC2 at 9pm.
