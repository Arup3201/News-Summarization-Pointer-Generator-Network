A 16-year-old student who  stashed explosives and a gun at his home planned to carry out a shooting attack at his Maryland school, police have said.

The teenage boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was originally arrested on suspicion of a series of vehicle break-ins on York Road in Monkton, Baltimore County, last Saturday.

But during a police interview, he allegedly revealed that he had explosive devices at his home and wanted to kill people at the George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology.

During a subsequent search of his house in Monkton, Baltimore County Police reportedly found three crude, homemade explosives alongside a gun, according to the Baltimore Sun.

They then called the Baltimore County Police Hazardous Devices Team, who dismantled the devices that were made from 'readily-available components' and believed to still be live.

Now, the teenager is facing a number of charges, including the possession of a destructive device and a handgun violation. He is also still charged with theft in relation to the car break-ins.

In an online statement, Police Chief, Jim Johnson, said the first responding officer who interviewed the tenth-grader 'did an exceptional job of police work'.

He added: 'Thanks to his diligence, we intervened in what could have been an extremely serious situation' at the school in Towson.

Meanwhile, a Carver administrator told the newspaper there were no 'red flags' that could have alerted staff to the student's deadly intentions.

'At this point, nothing has been shared with us [from the school] to give us any indication that this could have happened,' said Maria Lowery.

'We had no reason to suspect we had an issue.'

Parents of students at Carver - a premier arts school that is considered one of the top-performing insitutions in the country - were being notified of the suspect's charges on Monday

The teenager, who is being held at the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, a detention center for male youths, cannot be identified because he has been charged as a juvenile,

Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger said his office is currently reviewing the case to determine whether the boy should be charged as an adult instead.

Shooting: It comes just 10 days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg (pictured) shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing three girls and injuring the three others

The unsuspecting teens were all seated at a lunch table when 15-year-old Fryberg pulled out a .40-caliber Beretta handgun and shot each one, before committing suicide.

Last week, investigators said the shooter had lured his victims to the scene by text message before launching the deadly attack.
