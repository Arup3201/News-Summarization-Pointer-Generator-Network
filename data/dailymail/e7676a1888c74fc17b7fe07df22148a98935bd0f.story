Prince George might have a rival in the cute junior royal stakes: his third cousin Savannah Phillips - the daughter of Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn, and granddaughter of Princess Anne.

The three-year-old's spirited refusal to wear her woolly hat (complete with floppy ears and a button nose) while supporting Princes William and Harry at a Sandringham football match was seriously endearing. Well, for us anyway. Might have been a different story for her parents.

Dressed in pink wellies, pink tights and a flowery top, the Queen's first great-grandchild and the 13th in line to the throne had evidently decided the cute headgear didn't match her outfit.

Savannah makes a run for it, hat half off - will she manage to escape?

Savannah wasn't happy about having to wear a woolly hat to watch Prince William and Harry play football - even if it did have a cute dog face on it

Her mother Autumn's pleas were ignored, as Savannah stamped her little Wellington boots and held her ground.

Autumn,
 wearing a beanie complete with fashionable oversized pompom, warm quilted jacket and brown suede knee-high boots, struggled with her 
daughter on the sidelines of the football pitch - to no avail.

While the players battled it out beside them, Savannah and her mother were locked in an equally hard-fought tussle. One which Savannah won. The hat stayed off, in spite of the winter chill.

Savannah,
her little sister Isla, mother Autumn and father Peter Phillips were all supporting Princes William and Harry in the 
now-traditional Christmas Eve fixture involving estate workers near the 
Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.

Peter carried one-year-old Isla, who also looked a little out of sorts. Unlike her sibling, she had been persuaded into both a hat and a hood to keep out the cold.

As the football players battle for supremacy in the background, Savannah refuses to give in on her own struggle: the gloves - and the  hat! - are off!

The two princes were playing on opposite sides in the match, which proved a competitive affair.

While the banter was relatively 
friendly, it was clear that the brothers were playing to win as they 
clattered into each other on the rain-sodden pitch at Castle Rising.

At
 one stage, Harry, 29 – still bearded from his Antarctic charity trek – 
made fun of an opponent’s corner kick. William, 31, jokingly pleaded 
with the referee to issue a card, saying: ‘Give him yellow, give him 
yellow – backchat.'

You were pointing at the wrong person, William - If anyone deserved a yellow card that day, it was little Savannah!

Peter Phillips was left in charge of Savannah's little sister Isla, who didn't look much cheerier than her sibling. Although she had been persuaded into both a hat and a hood.
