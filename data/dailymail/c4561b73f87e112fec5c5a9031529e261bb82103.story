The mistress of convicted wife-killer Gerard Baden-Clay has revealed she dreamed of a future with him and his three daughters before he murdered his wife Allison.

Toni McHugh, who was having an affair with Baden-Clay when he killed his wife in April 2012, said she wanted him to leave his wife and set up a home with her before arranging shared custody of Gerard and Allison's children.

'The future I was planning with Gerard, it actually included them. It included Allison! I thought we would all get to the point where we all, you know, shared custody, like adults and got on,' Ms McHugh told Women's Weekly, which goes on sale on Thursday.

Ms McHugh also used the interview to apologise to Allison’s children. 'I need them to know I'm very, very sorry for what's happened,' she said.

Baden-Clay was found guilty on July 15 of killing Allison and dumping her body under a bridge 13km from their Brisbane home two years ago.

Ms McHugh told the magazine she drove over the Kholo Creek bridge while Allison's undiscovered body laid during the 10-day search for the Brisbane mother.

'We drove over the bridge and she was under there, and later that day, maybe around noon, we heard a woman’s body has been found, and I knew straight away – instantly – that it was Allison.'

The real estate agent, who started the affair with Baden-Clay when he was her boss, said she considered herself Australia's Monica Lewinsky, the mistress of former US President Bill Clinton, and she planned to write a book about the case.

'I'm still coping with the damage, emotionally and financially. I lost my job, which I loved, and which I was good at. And sometimes I feel like I'm Australia's Monica Lewinski, like what man is ever going to want to come near me? So I have suffered too,' she said.

Ms McHugh told the magazine she was 'furious' when she discovered Baden-Clay had been having affairs with other women after his wife disappeared, because he had told her she was the only one he'd ever had sex with other than his wife.

'Like an idiot, I believed it. But he’d also told me previously that he’d never been with any other woman besides Allison.'

'But I was still madly in love with him. I remember after police told me, Gerard called me from a blocked number and said `I’m outside your office, I’m in a cab, I have to talk to you’ and the first thing he said when I got in the cab was `are you wearing a wire?’.’

Ms McHugh said they went to a unit in the inner Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley where Baden-Clay gave her reasons for having sex with other women.

'Because he wanted to make sure what he had with me was 'real’,’’ Ms McHugh said of his reasons.

Ms McHugh also said she only came to believe Baden-Clay was responsible for his wife’s murder earlier this year.

'If you were told that your child had done something terrible, think about how much you love your children, how long it would take you to come to terms with that?' she said.

In an interview with Channel Nine's 60 Minutes after Baden-Clay's sentencing, Ms McHugh said she was 'genuinely fearful' that she was involved with a man who was not who he said he was.

In an interview with Channel Nine's 60 Minutes after Baden-Clay's sentencing, Ms McHugh said she was 'genuinely fearful' that she was involved with a man who was not who he said he was.

'That worries me and that terrifies me,' she said.

'I believed I was in a loving, caring relationship that did have a future.

'He had told me that he would marry me one day.'

The three-and-a-half year affair between Baden-Clay, 43, and Ms McHugh commenced in August 2008.

Ms McHugh said she was devastated when she first heard Alison was missing.

'I never ever wanted harm to her… I didn’t intentionally go out to hurt Allison or her family. I honestly believed it [their affair] was going to be handled properly,' she said.

Baden-Clay had shamelessly pretended to search for his wife, and had used a razor blade to disguise what were really the marks of Allison's finger nails on his face, a court was told during his hearing
