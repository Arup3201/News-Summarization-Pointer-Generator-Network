Penny Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, said ‘c**k’ six times and ‘lay’ or ‘laid’ five times in a debate purportedly about the welfare of poultry

A Tory MP was criticised yesterday for making a speech riddled with innuendo in the House of Commons following a dare from friends in the Royal Navy.

Penny Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, said ‘c**k’ six times and ‘lay’ or ‘laid’ five times in a debate purportedly about the welfare of poultry.

It came during the Easter Adjournment debate, by long tradition a time for more lighthearted and off-beat topics.

But while the Portsmouth North MP clearly intended her speech to be humorous, many felt she went too far.

Yesterday the Mail on Sunday revealed that she was dared to say the rude words by Royal Marines at a mess dinner. 

She later contacted them to tell them that she had met the challenge.

Miss Mordaunt, a contestant on ITV’s diving show Splash! this year, was accused of trivialising Parliament. 

Labour MP Kate Hoey said: ‘She should realise that the House of Commons is not a TV reality show. The public expects debates in the Chamber to be on matters of serious concern. It is sad that she has misused it in this way – it sets a bad precedent.’

Thousands criticised her speech online, but Miss Mordaunt’s colleagues rallied around her.

George Hollingbery, a neighbouring Tory MP, said: ‘She is an absolutely cracking MP who does a huge amount in her local area.

‘She is a character. The House of Commons is full of characters and it’s a better place for it.’ Hampshire councillor John Wall wrote on Twitter: ‘Good to have a member of Parliament and minister with a sense of humour.’

Miss Mordaunt gave the speech in March 2013, before she was made a communities minister. Other topics in the end-of-term session included e-cigarettes and thanks for Commons staff.

She freely disclosed the story behind the address at the Spectator Magazine’s awards dinner last week. 

She said: ‘Some of my Marine training officers at Dartmouth thought it would be a good idea to break my ladylike persona by getting me to yell rude words during the most gruelling part of our training.

They failed, but during our mess dinner at the end of the course, I was fined for a misdemeanour.

‘The fine was to say a particular word, an abbreviation of cockerel, several times in a speech on the floor of the Commons, and mention all the names of the officers present.’ 

Her speech, which was recorded in Hansard, the official record of the Commons, and broadcast on TV, began: ‘The cause of hen and cock welfare is one raised with me by many constituents.

‘One imagines several hens and a single proud cockerel, but one strutting coxcomb will lead to many chicks and what is to become of the male contingent with not a layer among them? I encourage people to . . . think carefully about a coop for a cockerel.’

It concluded: ‘Let us have no cock-ups on hen welfare.’
