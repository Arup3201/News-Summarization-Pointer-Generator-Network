Jon Stewart has announced he is stepping down from his job at The Daily Show.

The popular host, who began working on the Comedy Central news program in January 1999, made the announcement at a taping of his show on Tuesday.

He will leave at the end of this year, most likely when his contract expires in the Fall.

'Seventeen years is the longest I have ever in my life held a job by sixteen years and five months. The upshot there being I am a terrible employee. In my heart I know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity,' said Stewart.

'I don't have any specific plans. I have a lot of ideas. I have a lot of things in my head. We're going to have dinner on a school night with my family who I have heard from multiple sources are lovely people,' he added. 

'You know, I'm not going to be here and try to sum up what this place has meant to be mover the years. I couldn't' do that. We got plenty of time.' 

Getting emotional he then said; 'What is this fluid? What are these feelings? Frankenstein angry!' 

He closed by saying; 'It's been an absolute privilege. It's been the honor of my professional life, and I thank you for watching it. For hate watching it. Whatever reason you were tuning in for.' 

'For the better part of the last two decades, I have had the incredible honor and privilege of working with Jon Stewart. His comedic brilliance is second to none,' Michele Ganeless, President of Comedy Central, said in a statement. 

'Jon has been at the heart of Comedy Central, championing and nurturing the best talent in the industry, in front of and behind the camera. Through his unique voice and vision, ‘The Daily Show’ has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.'

'Jon will remain at the helm of The Daily Show’ until later this year,' she added.

'He is a comic genius, generous with his time and talent, and will always be a part of the Comedy Central family.'

Under Stewart, the show has won 18 Emmys, taking home the award for Best Variety Series every year from 2003 to 2012.

It also won two Peabody Awards, for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004. 

The show has had two shows spin-off the program, The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert and the recently debuted The Nightly Show with Larry Willmore.

Another former corespondent, John Oliver, also hosts a similar news program on HBO, Last Week Tonight, which premiered last year. 

The show has also been the launching pad for many now A-list stars, including Ed Helms, Josh Gad, Olivia Munn, Rob Riggle, Rob Corddry and Steve Carell, who went on to star in The Office and was just nominated for an Oscar for his role in Foxcatcher.

Stewart, 52, had hinted at his possible departure from this show starting late last year in interviews while promoting his directorial debut Rosewater.

'When do you decide that even though it's this place of great comfort and you feel like you're plugged into it like you've never been plugged into anything else that you've ever done, you know ... there are other considerations of family or even in the sense of just not wanting to be on television all the time' he told Terry Gross in an NPR interview. 

'You know, you can't just stay in the same place because it feels like you've built a nice house there. And that's really the thing that I struggle with. And it is unclear to me.'

He also tole The Hollywood Reporter when asked if he still enjoyed doing the show; 'Uh, yeah. I mean, like anything else, you do it long enough, you will take it for granted, or there will be aspects of it that are grinding. I can't say that following the news cycle as closely as we do and trying to convert that into something either joyful or important to us doesn't have its fraught moments. But there will come a point where I'm sure.' 

Stewart released his directorial debut Rosewater last year, and is seen with lead actor Gael Garcia Bernal

This as his contract, with a reported salary in the $25million to $35million range per year, is set to expire.

There had also been talk of Stewart leaving when it was reported he was offered the hosting job on NBC's Meet the Press, something Stewart confirmed but a position he said he would never take. 

No doubt making this loss even more difficult for Comedy Central is that it comes on the heels of Colbert leaving his program to take over for the departing David Letterman on CBS's The Late Show. 

Almost immediately after the announcement was made, celebrities took to Twitter to pay tribute to Stewart's work on the show and state how upset they were to see him leaving.

'I KNEW WHEN JOHN STEWART LEFT TO DIRECT THAT MOVIE HE WAS GONNA TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS,' joked Mindy Kaling.

Former correspondent Gad wrote; 'Shocked & sad to see the man who gave me my big break on @TheDailyShow is ready to hang it up. #JonStewart can't wait to see what's next!'

Piers Morgan also weighed in; 'Jon Stewart quitting? Good timing. He was beginning to be eclipsed by John Oliver. This way, he can leave on a high.' 

Craig Ferguson, who recently left his late night program, said; 'Congratulations to Jon Stewart on an extraordinary groundbreaking run.'

Transparent actor and Togetherness creator Jay Duplass wrote; 'what will we do without you, Jon Stewart, oh captain our captain?' 

'Washington is rigged for the big guys - and no person has more consistently called them out for it than Jon Stewart. Good luck, Jon!' said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.

Stewart made his debut on the show January 11, 1999, taking over for original host Craig Kilborn. 

Prior to that he had hosted the critically praised but little seen The Jon Stewart Show on MTV and appeared in films including Playing by Heart, Big Daddy, Wishful Thinking and The Faculty.

He also twice served as host of both the Grammys and the Oscars while working on The Daily Show. 

Stewart released two books while at The Daily Show, co-written with his correspondents and the show's writers, America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction and Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race.

His audio recording of America won him a Grammy. 

Stewart married his wife Tracey in 2000, and the couple have a son and a daughter. 

Already there have been rumors about who might replace Stewart, with current correspondents and husband and wife Jason Jones and Samantha Bee being the most popular choice.
