But if you're going to splash out on anything, it might as well be this $1 million five-ton, 13-foot robot suit.

The real-life Transformer is available to purchase on Amazon for ￥120,000,000.

And according to the manufacturers, it's a piece of cake to use.

A click away! The machine, developed by Japanese company Suidobashi Heavy Industry, is $1m on Amazon

Incredible capabilities: At 13 feet and five tons, the real life transformer can be powered using an iPhone

The machine, developed by Japanese robotics company Suidobashi Heavy Industry, functions like an automatic four-wheel-drive, controlled by the user from inside a cockpit.

It can also be navigated using an iPhone, and moves at five miles an hour.

The decision to sell the landmark invention on Amazon.co.jp shocked tech-lovers across the world.

But you'll have to pay a premium for the exciting features: a rapid-fire BB gun and a LOHAS launcher - with can fire either water bottles or fireworks.

The team have been working on the robot since 2010.

The company also released a video where very attractive Anna gives step by step instructions of how to operate the Kuratas.

The video reminds the viewer of the security instructions on an airplane with Anna taking on the role as futuristic airhostess.

Not complete: Buyers will have to fork out more cash to get the accompanying weaponry for the machine

Easy to use! The manufacturers have made a video showing how to steer the mech suit like a four-wheel-drive

If you are not the piloting kind of millionaire, Kuratas can be operated using what Suidobashi calls the ‘Master-Slave system’ where you control the robot’s movements from outside using any device with a 3G network such as an iPhone.

‘Automatic alignment allows you to lock on your enemy target. Kuratas will not allow any targets to escape.

'With the alignment set appropriately the system will fire BBs when the pilot smiles.’

Realising that there may be a flaw with this system of opening fire, the video warns the pilot against smiling too much whilst operating the Kuratas weaponry.

Kurayas is 13ft tall and weighs four tons – not including the pilot.

The four wheeled legs ensures that it is easy to transport and the pilot will be able to drive it at a top speed of just under 6.5 mph.
