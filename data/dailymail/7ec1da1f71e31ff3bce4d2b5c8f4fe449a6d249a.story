Sickening footage has emerged of a teenage girl being viciously beaten by another girl – as fellow students did nothing to help.

Video taken on a cell phone at Massabesic High School in Waterboro, Maine, shows the attacker pinning the 16-year-old to the ground and repeatedly punching her in the face.

The assault took place while students were changing class - but the footage does not show anybody stepping in to stop the brutal onslaught.  

Sickening: A 16-year-old girl was viciously beaten by another girl at Massabesic High School in Maine in an attack that was caught on camera

The mother of the terrified victim has described the incident as ‘sickening’ and believes the attack may have been planned.

Refusing to reveal her name through fear of drawing more attention to her daughter, she told CBS 13 that the footage was ‘disturbing’ and ‘hard to watch’.

She added: ‘My daughter’s only 98 pounds. She’s a tiny little thing.

‘It’s terrifying to see your daughter go through something like that. It’s … it’s sickening.’

Her daughter needed medical treatment after suffering ‘five large bruises’ to her head and injuries to her arms where she was desperately trying to defend herself.

She suggested that those behind the attack ‘wanted it recorded’ so they could put the footage on social media meaning students from other schools could see the incident.

Bangor Daily News reported that she had been told by school Principal Christian Elkington that the attack was ‘a terrible thing’ and that the school was ‘dealing with it appropriately’.

She is said to have received a letter from Superintendent John Davis who apologised and pledged to address the incident quickly. But the victim’s mother says she does not know whether anybody has been expelled.

The website reports that the victim has a restraining order against her attacker and that the youngster still fears repercussions.
