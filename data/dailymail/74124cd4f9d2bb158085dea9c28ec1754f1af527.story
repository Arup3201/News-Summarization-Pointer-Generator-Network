Workmen spent a morning ripping up a woman's drive before realising they had been sent to the wrong address.

Julie Tworogal, 50, returned home to find her concrete and pebble driveway reduced to rubble.

At first she thought her home in Eastwood, Essex, had been targeted by vandals.

Uh oh: Julie Tworogal returned home to find her concrete and pebble driveway reduced to rubble

Then she realised the same workers were busy digging up another drive a few doors down - the one they were supposed to have done in the first place.

Sean Cane, owner of Ben Driveways, in Leigh, Essex, admitted it was his blunder and had sent the men to the wrong address.

Mrs Tworogal made a frantic call to husband, Christopher, 37, before discovering the 'culprits' had set to work on another driveway further down her road. 

Mrs Tworogal, who'd been away for five hours, said: 'I came home from work to find my driveway had been completely ripped up. 

'I simply could not believe my eyes. I called my husband and was screaming down the phone that someone had torn our drive up. 

'I went to a neighbour to see if they had seen anything.

Mix-up: Julie Tworogal thought her home in this street in Eastwood, Essex, had been targeted by vandals

'They had watched the whole thing, but thought we knew about it and didn't question it! I just wandered around in a bit of a daze and then spotted workmen down the road.'

Mrs Tworogal confronted the workers from Leigh-based Bill and Ben Driveways on Monday. 

She said: 'They had got a text from their boss asking where they were because the real client had called him saying they weren't there. 

'They replied they were there and had just dug the drive up. Then they realised they had been sent to the wrong number.'

After discovering the mistake the workers went to work at the right address, but later returned to remove all the smashed rubble from Mrs Tworogal's front. 

After the initial shock, the couple saw the funny side. 

Mrs Tworogal said: 'We finished up laughing hysterically. 

'It was just a mistake and the company is going to replace my driveway. 

'We were going to do it anyway, but just not so soon! And I've even paid a bit more to get an upgrade so I will soon have a nice cobbled driveway.'

Sean Cane, owner of the company, carried the can for the mix-up. 

He said: 'The guys just went to the wrong house after I gave them the wrong number. I got mixed up with another job. 

'When I got a call from the customer asking where we were I thought it was strange and then realised they were at the wrong house. 

'I went up there to sort it out for her. We will be putting in a new drive for her later this week and, yes, she has gone for an upgrade.'

Mr Cane, 46, added: 'She was very nice about it. Some people would have got more angry but she took it well. I don't think they guys would have dug it up if it hadn't looked so bad. I think she is pleased she is getting a new drive.'

The customer who had been expecting the company were unaware of the mix-up at the time.
