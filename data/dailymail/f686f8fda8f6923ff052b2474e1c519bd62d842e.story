Ryan McCann has been questioned by police after drugs were allegedly found in the walls of his home

A successful Brisbane real estate agent has been questioned by police after drugs were allegedly found in the walls of his home.

Ryan McCann, 36, was interviewed by police on Monday night after an operation that also included a search at his L J Hooker office in Cleveland, Channel Nine News reports.

McCann was charged with 34 drug-related charges and will appear at Cleveland Magistrates Court on Tuesday.

It will be alleged that as a result of a search warrant police located dangerous drugs at a Compass Court residence.

The Redland City Bulletin reports detectives with sniffer dogs executed six search warrants after a year-long investigation into an alleged methamphetamine ring.

In total, five men were arrested and are expected to be charged with up to 41 drug offences.

His father, Patrick McCann, told The Courier-Mail his family was 'distraught' and 'very upset' at the situation.

Mr McCann, who has represented LJ Hooker since 2007, was spruiked on the agency's website as having sold $40 million in property in the past 12 months.

But Mr McCann's profile has since been taken off the site which previously claimed he had been rated in the top 15 agents in the country based on settled sales.

The office at L J Hooker in Cleveland (pictured) was also searched as part the operation on Monday
