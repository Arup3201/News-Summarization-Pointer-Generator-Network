A terminally ill father-of-one has penned a number of heartbreaking letters to his three-year-old son which are to be opened on special occasions after being told he has less than six months to live.

Simon Langston, from Evesham, Worcestershire, has also renewed his wedding vows with his wife  of six years Kelly, 26, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.

He was told the devastating news in June, after a trip to his GP for dizziness and sickness resulted in him having a biopsy which revealed the tumour, and now hopes to hold on for one last Christmas with his family.

The 32-year-old has written the series of letters to his son, Alfie, so that the youngster will have part of his father with him for special occasions such as birthdays, the day he passes his driving test and his own wedding day.

Mr Langston also chose to renew his wedding vows with his wife on Halloween and invited 80 guests to the spooky-themed ceremony, which also raised money for charity.

The bride wore her original wedding dress, customised with jewelled spiders, while the groom's face was painted as a skull and his wheelchair adorned with ribbons and autumn leaves.

Their young son, Alfie, also wore a Halloween-inspired suit, which was decorated with spiders and inflatable bat wings.

The couple recited a poem to each other in front of the guests, who also joined in with the theme and donned fancy dress.

Mrs Langston said: 'We both had the most magical, amazing day, and were overwhelmed by the effort people made to dress up.

'It was a highly emotional ceremony, but it was lightened at points by the sound of Alfie inflating his wings, which had our guests in giggles.

'Simon did amazingly well and managed to stay for all of the day and most of the evening.

'We are just so happy at this moment in time, and cherishing every second.'

The couple married six years ago (above) but decided to renew their vows after Mr Langston's diagnosis

The couple, from Worcestershire, renewed their vows with a Halloween-themed wedding ceremony last Friday

The couple, who have been married for six years, discovered Mr Langston had brain cancer in June after he started to feel unwell following a night out with friends.

Mrs Langston said: 'Simon had been out with his friends for his birthday, but when he came home, he was dizzy and being sick. I knew he hadn't drunk very much, so I was worried.

'I drove him to the GP, and they gave him anti-dizziness tablets, but then I started to notice a slight droop on the right side of his face.

'I rushed him to an out of hours GP, and he was taken straight to Worcester Hospital. They did a scan, which revealed a tumour.'

A few days later, he underwent a biopsy at a Coventry hospital, which revealed the tumour was cancerous.

She said: 'It was in the middle of his brain, meaning it was too dangerous to remove it. I felt numb.'

The biopsy left Mr Langston with limited speech, and he is now confined to a wheelchair.

He underwent radiotherapy for two weeks, but his low blood count meant that it would be too dangerous for him to continue the treatment.

His wife added: 'It was really hard for Simon to not be able to express himself, or run around with his son.

'Simon used to be very active - he loved driving, and had a very physical job testing machinery at an AD plant, which turns food waste into electricity.

'The doctor told us that continuing radiotherapy would not make much difference, so we both decided that he would be more comfortable at home, where I could look after him, and where he would be able to spend as much time with Alfie as possible.

'It's been hard, but I used to be a care-assistant, so I have some experience.'

The couple have also chosen to freeze Mr Langston's sperm, so that his wife can one day give Alfie a brother or sister through IVF.

The couple are hoping to spend Christmas together

Mrs Langston said: 'When we had Alfie, our family really felt like it was complete.

'Simon's great with kids - he's been enjoying racing around in his wheelchair with Alfie, and he wants to see our family grow.'

She said her husband has been penning letters to the young boy so that he has something from his father on special occasions.

She added: 'Alfie's still a little too young to understand what is happening. 

'We both want to make sure that he knows how much his daddy loves him, and how he'll always be watching over him.'

The couple decided to renew their wedding vows on Halloween because of their love for the day.

Mrs Langston, who is now a full-time carer to her husband, said: 'We've always loved Halloween - Simon is a big kid really.

'We wanted something memorable - something that people could enjoy and have fun with, as well as raising money for a good cause.

'We were going to write our own vows, but when we put pen to paper, it got too emotional.

'I knew it would have been too hard to read them to each other, so we each chose a poem close to our hearts instead.'

During the day, Alfie handed out home-made toffee apples to the guests as wedding favours, with the help of bridesmaid Mia, 13.

The couple's special day was supported by Tesco and they managed to raise £1,500 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

Mrs Langston said: 'We raised over £720 through ticket sales alone, and that's not including tickets sold on the day.

'We've honestly been amazed by everyone's generosity. What started out as a small ceremony has been blown out of all proportion.

All of the 80 guests were also asked to wear fancy dress for the occasion, which raised £1500 for charity

'We are now looking forward to our next charity event, which will be a bonfire and firework display.

'All being well, this will be held on Sunday, so Simon is now throwing himself into thinking up some ideas for this.'

The family are now hoping to make the most of each day and are hastily making plans to ensure they their remaining time together is memorable.

Mrs Langston added: 'The doctors have advised us that we should take each month Simon is alive as a blessing.

'We are sincerely hoping that he makes it to Christmas, but for now I'm grateful to have him at home, where I can look after him and make him feel comfortable.

'Simon really has been given the worst diagnosis, but there's no point being sad. I just feel so lucky that we get time to say goodbye.'
