A pilot, who was about to fly a plane with hundreds of passengers on board, has been suspended by his employer after he was suspected of being over the legal alcohol limit.

The 51-year-old man, who works for holiday airline Thomson Airways, was stopped and detained by West Midlands Police at Birmingham Airport on Sunday February 10 just minutes before he boarded the plane.

Although the pilot has since been told he will face no further police action, Thomson is carrying out its own investigation into the incident.

A spokeswoman for the airline said: ‘Thomson Airways is aware that allegations of an aviation offence brought against one of our pilots have been dropped.

‘However, we are continuing to conduct an internal investigation into the situation and the pilot in question has been suspended.

‘We are not able to comment further until our investigations are complete.’

The pilot, who has not been named, 
was initially released on bail pending further inquiries after being 
arrested inside the airport on suspicion of being unfit to perform 
aviation duties due to drink.

A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed: 'A 51-year old man was arrested on suspicion of being unfit to perform aviation duties due to drink.'

It was not known where in the airport the pilot was arrested or whether it was the result of a tip-off or a random check.

All pilots and cabin crew operating in the UK are governed by the aviation section of the Railways and Transport Act 2003.

Drunk on duty: Air stewardess Stephanie Partington admitted being unable to perform her duties due to drink on a flight from Dubai to Birmingham last year

Under the legislation, they must abide by much tighter alcohol intake restrictions than those imposed on car drivers.

The limits are 9mg of alcohol in 100mL of breath - for driving it is 35 - and 20mg of alcohol in 100mL of blood, against 80 in driving.

Thomson is one of the biggest operators flying out of Birmingham, with at least six flights a day to destinations around the world.

It transports passengers to holiday hotspots in Spain, Greece, America, the Caribbean and Mexico.

The pilot was arrested less than six months after an Emirates stewardess on a flight from Dubai to Birmingham was sacked for being drunk on duty.

Stephanie Partington, aged 24 and from Liverpool, admitted being unable to perform her duties due to drink when she appeared at Solihull Magistrates’ Court last September.

She was fined £110, with £85 costs, and the court heard she had been dismissed by the airline.

The 24-year-old was so loud as she served passengers at the back of the 300-seat Boeing 777 that the purser had to ask her to 'quieten down'.

Suspicions were raised further when routine paperwork she filled out at the end of the seven-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham was illegible.

In February drunk airline pilot Radu Cristea, 38, allegedly tested positive for alcohol as he carried out pre-flight checks on his Bucharest-bound Airbus plane from London Heathrow.

Police swooped on him just half an hour before he was due to take off on the three-hour flight at 7am and state-run Romanian airline Tarom was forced to cancel the flight, with 33 passengers on board, Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in Middlesex heard.
