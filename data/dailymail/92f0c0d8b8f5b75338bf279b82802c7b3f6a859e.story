Pope Francis celebrated his first Palm Sunday Mass in St Peter's Square today, as hundreds of thousands joyfully waved olive branches and palm fronds.

St Peter's Square overflowed with 250,000 pilgrims, tourists and Italians eager to join the new pope at the start of solemn Holy Week ceremonies, which lead up to Easter.

In keeping with his spontaneous style, the first pope from Latin America broke away several times from the text of his prepared homily to encourage the faithful to lead simple lives.

Busy time: Pope Francis will be conducting several public services in Rome in the lead up to Easter Sunday when he will again take mass in St Peter's Square

The Palm Sunday ceremony recalls Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, but the Bible also recounts how he was betrayed by one of his apostles and ultimately sentenced to death on a cross.

Recalling the triumphant welcome into Jerusalem, Pope Francis said Jesus 'awakened so many hopes in the heart, above all among humble, simple, poor, forgotten people, those who don't matter in the eyes of the world'.

Francis then told an off-the-cuff story from his childhood in Argentina.

Blessing: Onlookers thrilled to see Francis handed over their children to be held by him as the 'popemobile' was driven through the crowd

Settling in: Pope Francis appeared at ease in his new role as leader of the Catholic Church, as he gave a thumbs-up to the enthusiastic crowd

Hope: In his homily, Francis made an impassioned plea to the crowd: 'Don't let yourselves be robbed of hope'

'My grandmother used to say, 'children, burial shrouds don't have' pockets'' he told the crowd, in a variation of 'you can't take it with you'.

'Don't let yourselves be robbed of hope! Don't let yourselves be robbed of hope!' Francis told the crowd, in an apparent reference to the economic downturn.

Since his election on March 13, Francis has put the downtrodden and poor at the centre of his mission as pope, keeping with the priorities of his Jesuit tradition.

His name, the first time a pope has called himself Francis, was inspired by St Francis of Assisi, who renounced a life of high-living for austere poverty and simplicity to preach Jesus' message to the poor.

Commemorative: Some 250,000 faithful Catholics waved olive branches and palm fronds to recall Jesus' entry into Jerusalem

Big turnout: Pilgrims, tourists and locals clambered to see Francis at the Vatican

Francis wore bright red robes over a white cassock as he presided over the Mass at an altar sheltered by a white canopy on the steps of St Peter's Basilica.

Cardinals, many of them among the electors who chose him to be the Roman Catholic church's first Latin American pope, sat on chairs during the outdoor ceremony held on a breezy day in Rome.

In his homily, Francis said Christian joy 'isn't born from possessing a lot of things but from having met Jesus. That same joy should keep people young,' he said.

Spontaneous: The new Pope has a friendly and open approach to meeting the public, prompting many parents to pass their children forward to him

Embrace: The Pope encouraged people to be humble and young at heart as he reached out to children in the crowd

'From seven to 70, the heart doesn't age' if one is inspired by Christian joy, said the 76-year-old pontiff.

Francis said he was joyfully looking forward to welcoming young people to Rio de Janiero for the Catholic Church's World Youth Day.Â 

At the end of the two-hour Mass, Francis swapped his red vestments for his plain white cassock and climbed into an open-topped 'popemobile' to circle through the excited crowd.

Meet and greet: Bodyguards handed babies up to the Pope, who seemed to enjoy meeting the public - young and old

Outdoor ceremony: Francis blessed the palms under a white canopy, with many of the cardinals who elected him Pope looking on

Solemn: Francis blessed the palms to mark the week leading up to Christ's resurrection on Easter Sunday

He has plans to visit Brazil in July, where he will attend the Catholic youth gathering, say Mass on Copacabana beach and pray at the Christ the Redeemer statue.

So far, that is the first foreign trip on the calendar of Francis' new papacy.

The faithful knelt on hard cobblestones paving the square, and Francis knelt on a wooden kneeler at the point in the Gospel that recounts the moment of Jesus' death.

On Good Friday, Frances will attend the Way of the Cross procession at the Colosseum and next Sunday he will conduct Easter Mass.
