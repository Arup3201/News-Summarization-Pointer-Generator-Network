Football presenter Adrian Chiles has a new expanded role at BBC Radio 5 Live as the top female presenters exit in the ‘biggest shake-up’ to the station in years.

The 47-year-old, who is currently on World Cup duties in Brazil, returned to the station last year after quitting the BBC to head to ITV.

He will now front the popular 10am show 5 Live Daily on Mondays and Tuesdays.

New role at BBC Radio 5 Live: Adrian Chiles will host a mid-morning show on Mondays and Tuesdays

Chiles, who was one of the launch presenters for the station, said: ‘Twenty years ago, I felt the luckiest man alive to land a job on the network when it launched. I feel no less delighted now to be part of this relaunch and I can't wait to get started.'

On other weekdays Peter Allen will present the mid-morning show, moving from his position as co-host of the drivetime slot.

Award-winning presenter Victoria Derbyshire is to leave BBC Radio 5 live after 16 years, along with other popular and well-established names Richard Bacon and Shelagh Fogarty.

Derbyshire, who has hosted a mid-morning show for a decade and prior to that hosted the breakfast slot, said she was moving to take up an unnamed ‘brilliant opportunity’.

The trio are moving in what the station says is the ‘biggest shake-up to its daytime schedule in years’, which will kick in from October.

Derbyshire - who was named speech broadcaster of the year at the Radio Academy Awards in May - said: ‘It's a huge wrench to leave 5 live where listeners and I have shared so many experiences, and I would like to thank them enormously for trusting me.

‘As to what I'm doing next - well I've been offered a brilliant opportunity too good to turn down.’

Afternoon presenter Bacon is leaving his show after seven years and among his future projects will be a BBC1 series hunting for amateur painters, which he will co-host with the actress Una Stubbs. 

He said: ‘It's time to have different adventures, many of which will still be at the BBC.’

Fogarty, a former breakfast co-host who now presents the lunchtime show, said she would be spending the summer ‘exploring a number of opportunities, before deciding what's next’.

A new weekday 1pm to 4pm slot, called Afternoon Edition, will be presented by Dan Walker and Sarah Brett. And the 4pm to 7pm Drive programme will see regular co-host Anna Foster joined by former newspaper editor Tony Livesey.

Newcomers to the station include former Sky Sports News presenter Georgie Thompson and stand-up comic Josh Widdicombe who will join the team on weekend show Fighting Talk.

Station controller Jonathan Wall said: ‘This autumn feels the right time to refresh parts of our schedule as we follow-on from what's already proving to be a wonderful sporting summer.’

‘Victoria, Shelagh and Richard have all played such key roles delivering fantastic live radio and I wish them every success with their future projects.’

Jason Roberts also joins the 5 live Sport team after a successful spell on the football phone-in show, 606.

And with Dan Walker moving across to Afternoon Edition, Mark Chapman will be the new Friday night 5 live Sport host, previewing the weekend’s sporting action, while Jonathan Overend will take over the reins of 5 live Sport on Sunday afternoons.BBC Radio’s chief football correspondent, Mike Ingham, who retires from commentary at the 2014 World Cup final, will present 5 live football specials throughout the 2014/15 season.

Plus, John Murray will become the new football correspondent.
