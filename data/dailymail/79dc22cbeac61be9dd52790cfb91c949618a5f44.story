Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s children have finally warmed to their father’s mistress-turned-wife almost twenty years since he announced their engagement.

When the iconic Labor leader left his First Lady and wife of 39 years, Hazel Hawke, in 1995 to marry his biographer Blanche d’Alpuget, the news shook the nation.

But what concerned Mr Hawke most was the huge family fallout. With their lives torn apart, his children were extremely vocal about their anger and upset.

In a two-part documentary for the ABC, Mr Hawke has revealed that only now are his kids finally warming to Ms d’Alpuget.

‘The kids weren't happy about the fact that I divorced and married Blanche. And they weren't as nice to Blanche as they could and should have been,’ he said.

Ms d'Alpuget said: 'They didn't want me as part of the family and they actually put that in writing.’

Australia’s ‘common man’ Prime Minister appeared in his first ever TV biography, which profiles what the  Labor legend - who drink brandy with breakfast - is really like, before he turns 85 next month.

It was just three years ago that Mr Hawke’s daughter Sue Pieters-Hawke and Ms d’Alpuget were seen arguing at Brisbane airport, indicating that all was still not well within the family.

Ms Pieters-Hawke has now spoken for the first time about how they got over their differences, explaining: 'It took a bit of time to come around I think but it’s a matter of deep satisfaction to me that the family has reformed. 

'Blanche has been a great step grandmother to my kids and a great stepmother to me.'

He was married to his first wife Hazel Hawke -  a much-loved First Lady - for 39 years

In the ABC show, her sister Rosslyn Dillon also said she disliked her stepmother so much that she didn’t want to talk to her.

‘I think I said something to Blanche along the lines of, “Oh well, if you're still around in 10 years we'll see if we can sit down and have a chat then”,’ she said.

Mr Hawke’s first wife Hazel, who he married in 1956 before he was elected as the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia on 11 March 1983, died last year from a stroke after suffering from Alzehimer’s.

They had four children together, including Susan Pieters-Hawke, Stephen and Roslyn, but their fourth child, Robert Jr, died in his early infancy in 1963.

Mr Hawke went to see his former wife before she died on May 23, 2013, and sang to her by her bedside, his grandson David Dillon told The Australian.

‘I know it would have given him amazing closure to be there with someone who committed a significant portion of her life to him with such unwavering support,’ Mr Dillon said.

The former Labor leader was known for his affair and his love of drinking but was also extremely popular

Mr Dillon told the paper while his mum Roslyn was being treated for her heroin addiction, Mr and Mrs Hawke cared for him like parents.

The admired down-to-earth stateswoman was given a public memorial at Sydney Opera House, where more than 1,600 came to show their support, including then Prime Minister Julia Gillard Governor-General Quentin Bryce and former prime ministers John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Mr Hawke.

Mrs Hawke reportedly tolerated the powerful leader’s open relationship with Ms d'Alpuget whilst he was Prime Minister.

But their marriage ended three years after his retirement from politics in 1991.

Speaking at his home in Northbridge, on the lower North Shore in Sydney, for the ABC’s Australian Story, Mr Hawke told how Ms d'Alpuget tried to build a relationship with his children and is now closest with Rosslyn Dillon.

‘She's been particularly helpful to my youngest child Rosslyn and I think from the original feelings of perhaps resentment that Rosslyn had, they've moved to one where Rosslyn really loves Blanche,’ he said.

Ms Dillon told the show: ‘Particularly since I lost Mum, we have become extremely close.

‘She's a very funny woman, very loving, very passionate, a very wicked sense of humour and her and Dad are so in love.’

Blanche told Australian Story that Bob's children once put in writing how much they disliked her

Mr Hawke is now Australia’s oldest living former Prime Minister.

He grew up in the union movement and spent a decade as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

As well as being renowned for his support from those inside the Labor party he was known for his love of beer, footy and cricket.

He famously holds a world record for seeing off a yard of ale in just 11 seconds during the 1950s.

Earlier this year, egged on by dozens of boisterous fans dressed as legendary commentator Richie Benaud, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke downed a pint of beer in 10 seconds flat at the Sydney Ashes Test. The 84-year-old didn't hesitate when challenged by rowdy fans and was previously caught on camera doing the same thing at the same Sydney Test last year.
