Police say 41-year-old Vincent Lavon Johnson is the man who so callously beat down Jessica Smith, 35, in the Pensacola store on Wednesday.

While difficult to watch, the video is part of what helped police quickly identify Johnson as the subject before nabbing him early Thursday.

Horrible: Shocking video shows a robber brutally punching a pregnant Boost Mobile store clerk in Pensacola, Florida

Arrested: Vincent Lavon Johnson was arrested Thursday following the brutal Wednesday attack after several tipster ID'd him to police as the man in the footage

Before feeling the relief of seeing the man she identified as her assailant put in jail, Smith had to first suffer the brutal attack.

Footage shows Smith as she greets the man. He fidgets for a moment, puts something in his pocket, then completely without warning he throws a punch over the counter and hits Smith squarely in the face.

The gruesome seconds thereafter show her fly through the air and hit the floor in a heap.

'Please!' she pleads. 'I'm pregnant!'

The man struts around to the employee side of the desk and demands to know how to open the register.

'Oh my God,' Smith moaned as she lay on the ground. 'There is a button.'

The man then opens the till and stuffs cash into his pants before making a hasty exit.

According to WEAR, the Pensacola Police received several tips naming Johnson as the assailant after distributing the footage for media broadcast.

Thursday morning, officers responding to a tip found Johnson wearing the same clothes as in the video, but he quickly ran from them.

Following a brief chase with a K9 unit, police arrested Johnson at a Pensacola home.

He's charged with felony battery, strong-arm robbery and burglary.

Smith was reportedly taken to an area hospital with a broken nose and is expected to recover.
