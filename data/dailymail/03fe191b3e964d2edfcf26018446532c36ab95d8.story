When Mick Jagger was faced with the tragic news of L’Wren Scott’s suicide, it was his band-mates who rallied around him.

Amazingly, after fifty turbulent years - there have been punch-ups, fall-outs and even affairs with each other’s lovers - the Rolling Stones remain tight.

So as unlikely as it might sound - perhaps there’s some truth in an unusual theory from Dr Ruth Blatt, a doctor of organisational behavior in the US, that within The Stones ' bond lies many of the qualities to making relationships last.

Charlie Watts, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Mick Jagger celebrated 50 years together in 2012 (above) and are now into their sixth decade

Her 
theory, which appeared in American magazine Psychology Today, even sites
 the band's many acrimonious moments as being key to their strength.

'They’re
 like brothers who will always be there for each other and at times of 
tragedy that’s when you really see them stepping up and expressing that 
love,’ Dr Blatt tells Femail.

'They haven't always been an example for marital bliss, but couples have a lot to learn from the Rolling Stones when it comes to how the band members conduct their professional relationships,’ she says of the rockers now into their sixth decade together.

‘The secret ingredient that’s helped them stay bonded is a priceless lesson for marriage.’

And luckily Dr Blatt has discovered exactly what that secret ingredient is. ‘It's about prioritising commitment above all else,’ she explains.

‘The Rolling Stones are a perfect example of how you can make a relationship work -- despite anything -- if you are totally committed.’ 

And in their case ‘despite anything’ encompasses a fair few misdemeanours.

They've slept with each other’s girlfriends – Mick Jagger famously had an affair with Keith Richard's long-term girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, then Richards slept with Jagger's lover Marianne Faithful, which Richards admits in his memoir Life, was pure retaliation.

‘While you’re missing it, I’m kissing it,’ he poetically puts it.

‘There’s been violence and verbal abuse too -- Charlie Watts punched Mick Jagger for calling him “my drummer” and Keith Richards and Watts called Jagger “that bitch Brenda”,’ says Dr Blatt.

'There were other hurtful moments too. Mick did a solo deal with their label without telling the band. He went on the road on his own and played Rolling Stones songs, which they saw as riding on the band's success without them.'

'That was really hurtful to the others. And when I researched it further I found there was often a clash of egos and a battle for attention and credit.

'In Richards book, Life, he's quick to point out that he created the riff in certain songs and Mick just wrote the words. He's constantly trying to even out the perception.'

‘Any one of these incidents would be enough to tear most bands apart,’ Dr Blatt points out, but it’s their ‘for better or for worse’ commitment that’s kept them together.

‘They made a choice…Are we going to let these differences break us up? But they decided “no”. They’re totally bonded to each other.’

As Richards once said, ‘The Stones are bigger than any of us.’

‘They may have arguments but they know that nothing compares to the magic they create when they’re together, which none of them could do alone,’ says Dr Blatt.

Famous bust-ups: Mick Jagger had an affair with Keith Richard's girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, (pictured above right with Richards and their son Marlon,) and Richards retaliated by sleeping with Jagger's girl Marianne Faithfull (above left with Jagger) -- but despite it all the band have remained committed to each other

In fact, Dr Blatt says the ageing rockers' many indiscretions have ironically been a source of relationship strength.

‘Their continual blow-ups have given them countless opportunities to assess and ultimately reaffirm their commitment to each other, which in the long-run has made them stronger,’ she explains.

‘Every time their relationship was tested, they remade that choice to stay together.'

Blatt’s theory is backed up by a study in the Journal of Marriage and Family, which found commitment, is more important in a marriage than doing or saying the right thing.

The Rolling Stones have stood the test of time and according to Dr Ruth Blatt are a great role model for romantic relationships

'The study found that commitment on its own is the number one predictor of marital success. If you’re not committed, you're not going to do what it takes -- which can mean forgiving and moving on even in the toughest of times.

'When you’re committed you need to forgive and forget. It's the strongest predictor of longevity.

‘If you don’t have that commitment, there will always be an easier option. When relationships get complicated it takes less effort to leave than to stay.

'But if you have that commitment ingrained then you'll do what's necessary to save it.'

‘What The Stones have is like a family love,’ she explains.

At times they’ve driven each other nuts but when it comes to it they’d do anything for each other.

As Dr Blatt concludes, 'If all married couples shared their attitude, we'd see a lot more marriages lasting.'
