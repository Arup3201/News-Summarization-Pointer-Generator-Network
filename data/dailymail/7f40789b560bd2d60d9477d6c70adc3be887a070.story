Death: William Graham, 16, has been described as an 'amazing pianist' and 'confident young man'

A 16-year-old talented schoolboy was found hanged after he was allegedly taunted by bullies ahead of his final GCSE exams.

William Graham - who has been described by friends as an ‘amazing pianist’ and ‘confident young man’ - was found dead at his home in Waterlooville, Hampshire, on Thursday.

He was a pupil at Crookhorn Community College, where he studied subjects including physical education, music, history and drama.

But the mother of a fellow pupil at the school, who did not wish to be named, said yesterday: ‘There are suspicions he was being bullied. What a waste of a young life.’

Flowers and tributes were left outside the school gates after his death. But friend Sianie Lucy Anderson said on Facebook: ‘Whoever did this, I hope they pay for what they have done.’

And classmate Kate Douglas said: ‘Will was a talented young man with so much going for him.

‘He was a kind friend, an amazing pianist and a loved member of Crookhorn College’s family. He was a close friend of mine, and we shared a lot of classes and therefore memories.’

Another friend, Luke Folkard said he had spoken to William about three hours before he died - and he 'sounded happy'. Luke added that William’s friends were now hoping to raise money for a piano in his memory.

Grahame Sammons, headmaster of Crookhorn College, told MailOnline today: 'We know that our students have been deeply affected by this sad news and we will offer support as appropriate.

'The staff, governors and students would like to express our condolences and deepest sympathies to William’s family at this distressing time.

'William was a talented musician whose skills as a pianist we will all remember with affection. 

'He was a popular student amongst staff and peers with a great future ahead of him, which makes his loss hard for all who knew him to bear.'

One message for William read: ‘Will was an amazing, strong, confident young man. He would always put a smile on your face. I will miss him dearly. I will keep hold of all our deepest memories.'

Mourning: A spokesman for the college's parents' association said its thoughts were with William's family

A memorial for William was held outside the school yesterday, attended by more than 200 pupils.

A spokesman for the college's parents' association said last night: ‘The Crookhorn Parents’ Association offers their heart-felt condolences to the Graham family after the loss of their popular and talented son William. Our thoughts are with you, may he rest in peace.’  

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said police were investigating 'the death of a 16-year-old boy inside a house in Waterlooville' after being called at 5.50pm last Thursday.

He added that the death was not being treated as suspicious and had been referred to the coroner. 

The school, council and police have all been asked today to comment on claims he was bullied.
