A fired Oklahoma City nursing home worker was arrested for threatening to cut off a co-worker's head  - the day after a Muslim convert allegedly beheaded his colleague just 20 miles away.

Jacob Mugambi Muriithi, a Kenyan native who claims he 'represents ISIS,' made the threats at Bellevue Nursing Home, in Oklahoma City hours after Alton Alexander Nolen was named as the suspect in the brutal murder at Vaughan Foods.

The 30-year-old Muslim allegedly told the victim he was going to cut her head off with a blade and then post the footage on Facebook while they were working together last Thursday.

According to The Oklahoman, the victim who has not been named, then asked Muriithi why the group killed Christians and he reportedly said: 'This is just what we do.' 

A detective investigating the case wrote: 'The victim said Jacob asked her what time she got off work and she replied by asking him in a joking manner if he was going to kill her.

'Jacob told the victim, "Yes," he was going to cut her head off. The victim asked Jacob what he was going to cut her head off with and he said, 'A blade,' then told her after he did it he was going to post it on Facebook.'

They added: 'The victim said Jacob was serious when speaking and never made any statements that he was joking or playing around.'

He was arrested the same day and is now being held on terrorism charges in Oklahoma County Jail with his bail set at $1million.

The 30-year-old is said to have told the victim at Bellevue Nursing Home, Oklahoma City, that he would cut off her head with a blade and post the footage on Facebook 

Alton Nolen, 30, is expected to be formally charged with murder following the murder of Colleen Hufford, 54 at Vaughan Foods in Moore on Thursday. 

Her and Traci Johnson, who was also stabbed but survived the attack, apparently were targeted randomly at the facility. He is said to have returned to the scene hours after he was fired from his job.

Alton Nolen was shouting Islamic phrases as he tore across the store wielding a knife, it has been claimed. 

He was trying to convince workers that Islam teaches that the punishment is acceptable on Thursday, shortly before he was fired from his job, according to local media.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also looking into Nolen's background for any potential religious ties to the attack after former colleagues said he had attempted to convert them to Islam. Police said Nolen had recently become a Muslim.  

Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado, reports suggested today.

Alton Nolen is accused of killing Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbing Traci Johnson, 43, who apparently were attacked randomly at the facility in Moore on Thursday

The 30-year-old, who refers to himself as Jah Keem Yisrael on his Facebook page, is said to have stabbed and killed a colleague hours after he was fired 

It was also revealed that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, according to the The Oklahoman.

According to records he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported. 

He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time.
