Actor Alec Baldwin was 'extremely rude to the crew' and called them 'inappropriate names' on a flight out of Los Angeles yesterday - and it led to him being kicked off the plane.

American Airlines said in a statement issued on its Facebook page today that it would provide the facts of the matter after 'an extremely vocal customer' publicly identified himself.

Game boy? Baldwin said he was playing Words With Friends on Twitter but later claimed he was dealing with important messages in his blog

The 53-year-old refused to to turn 
off his phone at the appropriate time, then stood up, took his phone 
into the toilet and slammed the door, according to the airline.

He was pictured at LAX looking agitated after being removed from the plane.

The statement reads: 'He slammed the 
lavatory door so hard, the cockpit crew heard it and became alarmed, 
even with the cockpit door closed and locked.

'They immediately contacted the cabin
 crew to check on the situation.

'The passenger was extremely rude to the
 crew, calling them inappropriate names and using offensive language. 
Given the facts above, the passenger was removed from the flight and 
denied boarding.'

Not happy: Baldwin's demeanour could only be described as annoyed

American Airlines said phones must be turned off for taxiing and takeoff.

The 30 Rock star's Twitter account 
has been deactivated today, but in earlier tweets he criticised the 
airline and vowed never to fly with them again.

'Flight attendant on American reamed me out 4 playing WORDS W FRIENDS while we sat at the gate, not moving,' he wrote along with the hashtag, '#nowonderamericaairisbankrupt'

Baldwin then updated his flight status, writing: 'Now on the 3 o'clock American flight. The flight attendants already look.....smarter.'

He later tweeted that he was finally on his way, with a dash of satirical humour.

On his way: Baldwin tweeted to his fans that he was finally on his way, with a dash of satirical humour

Flight status: Earlier Baldwin updated his flight 
status informing that he had been re-booked on another flightÂ 

'#theresalwaysunited Last flight w 
American. Where retired Catholic school gym teachers from the 1950's 
find jobs as flight attendants,' he wrote.

The actor was finally arrived at JFK in the evening, after what had this time appeared to be a drama-free trip home.

Whispers of Baldwin's America Airlines began yesterday when Michael J. Wolf, Founder and Managing Director at www.activate.com, tweeted:'On an AA flight at LAX. Alec Baldwin removed from the plane We had to go back to the gate. Terrible that everyone had to wait'

His side of the story: Alec tweeted his response after the incident exploded on the Twitterverse

Reamed: Alec was 'reamed' off a flight today, but made a 3pm departure with the same airline

Another Twitter user wrote: 'Alec Baldwin should never be allowed to fly quite frankly. His 
liberal politics represent a clear and present danger to the U.S.'

Before
 another added: 'I was on the plane and yes Alec Baldwin was kicked off 
for grabbing 2 bags of peanuts and that is clearly an FAA violation. He 
may do time.'

Baldwin has allowed his temper get the better of him in the past.

In 2007, he horrendously left a voice mail for his young daughter calling her a 'rude, thoughtless little pig.'

He later apologised and wrote a book inspired by the incident.
