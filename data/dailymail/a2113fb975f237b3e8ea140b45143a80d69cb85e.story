Passengers on board the South Korean ferry sent heartbreaking messages to their family members just moments before it sank.

Children waiting to be rescued 
frantically reached for their phones as the boat began to list in a bid to communicate with their loved ones a final time.

Twenty-four people, including five students and two teachers, have been found dead, but 272 are still unaccounted for and feared to be trapped in the vessel.

Devastated: A relative wails as she is forced to wait for news on the passengers still unaccounted for. Children sent messages to their loved ones just moments before the vessel sank

A student sent a message to his mother, revealing some of those trapped inside were still alive.

It read: 'No phone connection so there is no Internet connection. So just sending text message.

According to CNN, the text went on: 'There are few people on the ship, can't see a thing, it's totally dark. So there are few men and women, women are screaming,and we are not dead yet, so please send along this message.'

Another harrowing message, reportedly sent by a passenger to members of his school theatre club, said: 'If I've wronged any of you, forgive. Love you guys.'

One student said: 'Mom, I'm sending you this now because I'm afraid I might not be able to say it later. I love you,' according to CBC.

His mother replied a short time later, asking: 'Why..? I was wondering why you weren't checking the messenger...'

But then she said: 'Me too son, I love you.'

The student is reported to have been rescued and has since been reunited with his family.

Submerged: Only a small part of the boat is now visible above the surface of the water as rescuers desperately try to find the missing passengers

The brother of passenger Woong Gi tried to reassure him that rescuers were on their way.

'Keep calm, don't panic, take your time, stay sharp, and do as they say,' he said.

'When data works contact me again, your brother.'

Police however have said hoax messages from people purporting to be on board have begun circulating.

The captain of the ferry has been accused of abandoning the ship and could face 
charges of negligence.

Reports
 suggest Lee Joon-seok, 69, was one of the first to jump to safety from 
the stricken vessel while many passengers were told to 'stay put' by 
rescuers.

It comes as allegations suggest only one of the 46 lifeboats were deployed as the boat began to sink.Â 

Footage
 showing the white survival capsules still attached to the vessel is 
believed to have emerged as the coast guard and maritime police 
frantically try to reach those trapped on board.

As the search operation entered its second day, rescuers were hammering on the upturned hull hoping for a response from hundreds of people.

Reports said submersibles were pumping oxygen into the hull, although the coastguard declined to comment.

The vessel capsized on Wednesday during a short journey from the port of Incheon to the holiday island of Jeju.

Hundreds
 of relatives were forced to wait on Jindo Island, the nearest piece of 
land to the scene, for news of their loved ones.

Operation: Dozens of vessels, including fishing boats, are into the second day of the hunt for the missing passengers. More than 470 people were on board the Sewol when it sank

Grieving parents accused officials of being slow to react and for lack of information.

'I am really angry with the government,' said Kwak Hyun-ok, whose daughter who was one of 340 children and teachers from one school on the vessel.

One parent, Park Yung-suk, saw the body of her teenage daughter's teacher brought ashore earlier in the morning.

'If I could teach myself to dive, I would jump in the water and try to find my daughter.'

The last major ferry disaster in South Korea was in 1993, when 292 people were killed.
