Even covered in peanuts and sunflower seeds a Dalek looks menacing.

Still, all this squirrel has to do to exterminate Doctor Who’s greatest enemy is turn round... and eat it.

The pair met on a bird table in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, created by Victoria Baker, 87, using a toy Dalek donated by grandson Charlie, ten.

She used an old dalek toy from her grandson, and painstakingly covered it with hundreds of peanuts and sunflower seeds.

This squirrel clearly wasn't in fear of being exterminated as they tucked into this nut-covered Dalek

'I used melted brown sugar and peanut butter to act as glue‚' said Mrs Baker, 87, at her home in Lyndhurst, in the New Forest National Park.

'It took several hours to complete, but I‚m very happy with the result, as are the local squirrels and birds!'

Mrs Baker and 10 year-old grandson Charlie sat at the window watching, as the first grey squirrel confronted the foot-high nutty Dalek.

'The animal was very nervous to start with, but soon realised one of his favourite foods was on offer‚' she said.

'Once he knew the Dalek was not going to exterminate him, he started tucking in. Pigeons, robins, thrushes and blue tits followed quickly.'

Mrs Baker said she had watched Doctor Who since it began in the sixties, first with her children, then with her grandchildren. 

The unusual treat, on a bird table in Hampshire, was created by pensioner Victoria Baker

A hungry bird got in on the act, taking a peck at a Dalek

And this pigeon decided to drop in and go nuts for the Dalek

'We've all enjoyed it over the years.'

The hit BBC show celebrated its 50th anniversary last year.

And the Christmas Day special saw the Doctor battling the daleks once again.

New Doctor Peter Capaldi will start filming series eight of the show this month. But fans will have to wait until the autumn before it hits our screens.
