Gritters were today loading up ahead of the fortnight-long cold snap as it was revealed councils have stockpiled 1.3million tonnes of salt this year.

Arctic winds are expected to bring at least two weeks of near-freezing conditions that will make this month up to 3C (5.4F) colder than last November.

And the sudden bitter spell will also bring the possibility of snow - with supermarkets preparing for a surge in sales of snow shovels.

Prepared: David Holmes, a truck driver from Durham, waits to load his gritter in preparation for the forecast cold snap at the Chilton Depot in County Durham

Help: David Holmes loads his gritter in preparation for the forecast cold snap at the Chilton Depot, which holds 5,000 tonness of salt ready to treat roads

Temperatures are forecast to drop below 
zero today and some of the chilliest conditions of the year are expected
by tomorrow, with the mercury plunging as low as -4C (25F) at night.

The freezing winds will bring a blanketing of snow to Scotland this 
morning, with wintry showers predicted to move south as the week 
progresses.

While the snow is expected to be 
limited to a light dusting for most, the bitter temperatures mean it 
will be clear winter is here and supermarkets are getting ready for a 
surge in sales of snow shovels and de-icers, as well as winter warmers 
such as soup and hot chocolate. 

Meanwhile,
a Local Government Association spokesman said 1.3million tonnes of salt
were stockpiled last year, compared to 1.2million in 2011 and 2010.

Be prepared: An earth mover shovels mountains of road salt at a storage and distribution terminal in Middlesbrough in preparation for the cold snap, as road ice warnings are issued across the country

Salt store: The Middlesbrough terminal handles around 1 million tons of rock salt per year, which arrives by train from a coastal mine and is tipped and stockpiled before being transported around the country

He told MailOnline more than 1.3million tonnes have been stockpiled this winter, and 26 councils have purchased full-sized gritters in the last 12 months.

Some 79 per cent of councils are also recruiting snow volunteers and using community grit bins so members of the public can access salt.

Salt costs £30 to £40 per tonne in normal market conditions, but this can vary based on the time of year it is ordered, and where it is being bought from.

Most of the salt is mined in Cheshire, with the main supplier being Salt Union, which can produce 6,000 tonnes per day.

Cleveland Potash, in Middlesbrough, produces salt as a by-product of its main operations and usually produces about 3,200 tonnes per day.

Snowy stroll: Ramblers in Hartside, Cumbria, last weekend enjoyed a brisk stroll after a heavy snowfall. This November is set to be around 3C colder than average

Bitter: Horses in the New Forest, Hampshire, walk on frozen grass yesterday as the sun rises

Late shades: A family make most of the autumn colours in Micheldever woods, Hampshire, last weekend, before the expected temperature brings in the start of winter

Forecasters are predicting that the 
first flakes of snow will fall in Scotland this morning, with the snow 
showers getting heavier as the week goes on.

Broadcast meteorologist Chris Fawkes said temperatures will
drop from tomorrow to Thursday, before recovering to a below-average level for the month.

And a
Met Office spokesman said: ‘Wintry showers will continue south on 
Tuesday morning, and with temperatures falling, roads are likely to turn
icy in places.

'Sleet and snow showers may be heavy at times, 
particularly over the north of Scotland, with accumulations of more than
10cm in places.

‘Any snow cover will be patchy over low-lying areas, with sleet or rain more likely near coasts.’

Chilly: A satellite image of the cold front as of 11am this morning. Conditions are expected to become colder from the North as we head into this evening

Getting colder: Temperatures are forecast to drop below zero today and some of the chilliest conditions of the year are expected by tomorrow

Beware: Yellow weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office across northern and western parts of the UK for icy conditions that will start today

Yellow
weather warnings have been issued for most of Scotland for Tuesday by 
the Met Office.

For Wednesday, it has extended its warnings to Wales, 
North West England, Yorkshire and Humber, West Midlands and East 
Midlands.

A MeteoGroup 
forecaster said: ‘Temperatures through the week will be much lower than 
recently and generally below the November average.

'It will struggle to 
get up to four or five degrees and during the nights temperatures will 
be below zero quite widely, meaning frost across most places.

‘It will be cold for quite a long prolonged period.’
