Lazio players from Albania and Serbia have come together to set an example of how football can transcend the world of politics.

Political tension between the two nations spilled over during a recent Euro 2016 qualifier when a drone carrying an Albanian flag provoked a mass brawl that eventually saw the match in Belgrade abandoned.

Albanian internationals Lorik Cana, Etrit Berisha and Thomas Strakosha share the same Lazio dressing room with Serbia's Filip Djordevic and Dusan Basta and the group have joined hands in a picture posted on Twitter to promote a positive message.

Speaking to the club's official website, Djordevic said: 'There is no trail of Serbia - Albania, no trace of intolerance between us. With Cana and Berisha we exchanged a few words in Belgrade, in an atmosphere quite friendly.

'Lazio have a common goal: to score points. I do not know what to say about what happened in Belgrade, but I can say that when I came back to Rome, with Cana and Berisha, we said our goodbyes as happened in all the previous days.

'I am convinced that our relationship will continue to be the same. We also exchanged a couple of words about what happened, but in all friendliness,' he added.

The drone struggled to fly as players and substitutes from both sides get involved in a scuffle

Both countries were charged by UEFA after the violent scenes in Belgrade 

Lazio President Claudio Lotito said: 'This is what is happening at Lazio - Cana, Berisha, Basta and Djordjevic represent a feeling of brotherhood.

'There are no political differences, on the contrary we have a harmonious union of people and countries.

'It's a further example of what football can teach politics.'

Supporters, some dressed all in black, clashed with police and players on the pitch at the Partizan Stadium

Lazio director Igli Tare, a former Albania international himself, supported the president's views that there will be no problem between the players.

'The players have an excellent rapport between themselves. They are good people and there will be no problem.

'I'm just disappointed that sport did not win. It was a very passionately-felt game and should've united the two countries. Instead everything else happened.
