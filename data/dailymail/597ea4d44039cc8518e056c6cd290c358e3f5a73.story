One of Britain’s leading wine merchants, Patrick Sandeman, plummeted to his death after his parachute became tangled with another just as he was about to land.

The 53-year-old father of three, an experienced jumper, plunged 50ft to the ground before dozens of horrified onlookers on Saturday afternoon. Paramedics made frantic efforts to save him but he died at the scene.

The second parachutist, a Frenchman aged 28, was taken to hospital after breaking his legs and damaging his spine in the accident at Sibson Aerodrome, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Wine merchant: Patrick Sandeman, 53, plummeted to his death after his parachute became tangled with another just as he was about to land on Saturday afternoon

Friends and colleagues said Mr 
Sandeman, a father of three from Putney, south west London, was a hugely
respected figure in the wine industry – and a member of the Sandeman 
family of port and sherry fame.

Last night tributes were paid to Mr 
Sandeman, co-owner of Lea and Sandeman’s wine merchants, with friends 
describing him as ‘charming’, ‘talented’ and ‘an inspiration’.

Well-known wine-critic and friend, 
Jancis Robinson said last night: ‘I am not alone in having found Patrick
one of the most appealing and entertaining characters in the wine 
business.

She added that he was ‘devastatingly 
handsome but not intimidatingly so. Charming but not oleaginous. Well 
informed but engaging.

‘Great company, in a word - and extremely talented in his ability to hand-pick great wines. A very bright light has been extinguished.’

His devastated 52 year-old wife Katie,
who was also involved in the business, and their three children, all in
their mid 20s, were said to be too distressed to comment yesterday.

Another friend and editor of Decanter 
magazine, Guy Woodward, said Mr Sandeman was considered one of Britain’s
leading wine merchants.

'Truly terrible news about the death of Patrick Sandeman in a tragic skydiving accident. A great guy and a fantastic wine merchant'

Guy Woodward, Decanter editor

He wrote on Twitter: ‘Truly terrible 
news about the death of Patrick Sandeman in a tragic skydiving accident.
A great guy and a fantastic wine merchant.’

And wine writer Mark Wells said: ‘Hard
to believe the shocking news about Patrick Sandeman. A man I respected.
The UK wine scene will be poorer without him.’

Mr Sandeman, who as well as being 
passionate about wine - appearing on the BBC and other television 
programmes as a wine critic - was a keen skydiver, regularly posting 
pictures of himself jumping on Twitter.

Tragically on July 25, he tweeted: 
‘Blues skies today so am skiving off to go skydiving and my first jumps 
of the year. Hopefully not my last!’

Investigation: An inquiry has been launched launched into fatal accident which happened Saturday afternoon

His multi-million pound business was 
established in 1988 with partner Charles Lea, 55, and has four stores in
Chelsea, Kensington, Barnes and Chiswick, west London. It has been 
named Merchant of the Year several years in succession.

A parachuting coach said he was told two men leapt separately from the same plane and crashed relatively near to the ground in the tragic incident.  

He said: ‘As far as I know it had been a normal jump, but
parts of their parachute got tangled. The type of parachute they were 
using had to have air passing underneath to stay inflated.

‘It means you have to keep moving all the time or the canopy caves in.

‘They were moving when the parachutes hit each other and collapsed and they fell to the ground.

‘It was such a terrible shock. It was 
so sad. They were both very experienced jumpers. I think they regularly 
jumped at Sibson with each other.

‘They were free jumpers, jumping on their own and doing stunts and things in the sky.’

A spokesman for the air ambulance 
charity Magpas said: ‘The medics began treating the older man because 
his injuries were more serious. He had not managed to land on his feet, 
which meant his body had taken the full impact.

'The doctors tried to do everything for him, they spent as long as they could trying to resuscitate him, but he couldn’t be saved'

Magpas spokesman

‘The doctors tried to do everything 
for him, they spent as long as they could trying to resuscitate him, but
he couldn’t be saved.

‘Somehow the other man had incredibly 
managed to land on his feet. The bottom of his legs suffered major 
trauma and he jarred his spine. But the doctors were able to straighten 
his legs and sedate him before he was flown to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in
Cambridge.’

Sibson Airfield is one of two bases 
used by UK Parachuting, which runs skydiving courses and organises 
charity jumps. The firm refused to comment last night.

The British Parachute Association, the sport’s governing body, is investigating the cause of the accident.
