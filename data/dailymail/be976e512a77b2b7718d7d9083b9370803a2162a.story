Hope Solo's domestic abuse case may be blocked before ever making it to trial.

The Olympian goalie has been in an out of court for months, in the lead up to a trial on charges she beat up her 17-year-old nephew in a heated dispute last June.

But on Tuesday, the 32-year-old's attorney asked a Kirkland County, Washington judge to throw out the case, claiming that the alleged victims 'hijacked' the case by 'substantially' changing their accounts of the brawl making it impossible for him to prepare for the case and for Solo to receive a fair trial.

Solo remained quiet throughout the hearing, while her husband, former professional football player Jerramy Stevens, supported her from the gallery.

Charges: U.S. women's national soccer team goalie Hope Solo appeared in court on Tuesday for a hearing related to assault charges she received last June, after allegedly beating up her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew in a drunken brawl 

Off the hook: Solo remained quiet in court as her attorney asked the judge to drop the case, based on evidence he gathered that the alleged victims had changed their account of the event 

Supportive husband: Solo's husband, former professional football player Jerramy Stevens, appeared in court to support her, as he has at many of the hearings over the last few months

The incident occurred on June 21, when Solo missed a flight and decided at the last minute to attend a family party at her sister's home. 

According to court documents, Solo got into an argument with her nephew over his athletic ambitions. She allegedly said he was 'too fat and overweight and crazy to ever be an athlete'. 

That caused the teen to lash back at Solo, calling her a name and demanding she leave the home. 

Instead, Solo allegedly followed the boy and continued to call him crazy and allegedly charged at him, punching him in the face and tackling him. 

The teen's mother, Solo's older half-sister, claims she tried to intervene and that Solo attacked her her as well.

Police broke up the fight after receiving a 911 call from a female at the house saying Solo 'was going crazy and hitting people'. At the scene, authorities noted that Solo appeared to be inebriated. 

She was charged with two counts of fourth-degree assault.

In court on Tuesday, Solo's attorney told the judge that the nephew and sister changed their stories when he re-interviewed them recently, and that the case should be thrown out due to their conflicting testimonies.

'Right from the beginning, the witnesses were refusing to answer my questions when they were very relevant to the case,' Solo's attorney Todd Maybrown said.

Maybrown says the teen told him that Solo slammed his head onto concrete multiple times in the altercation - which he did not report to police at the time. 

The teen's mother also says she witnessed the entire incident, which she did not claim in her first interview.

Maybrown believes the teen may have been under the influence of medication at the time as well, and that the alleged victim refused to answer his questions about medical history. 

The judge decided not to rule on the new information, but will decide whether to throw out the case at next week's hearing on January 6. He ordered the prosecution to turn over notes on the alleged victims' depositions and medical records for the teen. 

If the case proceeds, Solo's trial will begin January 20. 

'I agree dismissal is an extraordinary remedy,' Maybrown said. 'But when they’ve destroyed and hidden evidence…the only remedy would be dismissal.'

However, Kirkland County prosecutors disagree and believe there is enough evidence to send the case to trial.

'The extraordinary remedy is not one that is appropriate here,' City of Kirkland Deputy Prosecutor Lacey Offutt said, adding that these issues should  be heard 'in front of a jury'.

The prosecution went on to accuse Solo's attorney of improperly presenting information to the court. 

Solo continues to play for the Seattle Reign and U.S. women's national soccer team, despite her current legal troubles. 

Some have called it a double standard to let Solo continue to play, in light of recent domestic assault scandals in male-dominated sports.
