A ‘baby’ star has been captured just before ‘birth’ by astronomers for the first time - a breakthrough being described as the potential 'holy grail' of stellar evolution.

The discovery provides the missing link in understanding how giant gas clouds collapse to form fully fledged stars.

The star’s swirling disk of dust and gas is the youngest still-forming planetary system yet found - and could provide vital clues as to how our own solar system formed.

How a star is born: A young star pulls material from surroundings into rotating disk (right);
generating a huge flow of jets of material (left).

 Currently about one-fifth the mass of the Sun, the infant it is expected to pull in material from its surroundings to eventually match it.

The
 disk surrounding the young star contains at least enough ‘stuff’ to 
make seven Jupiters - the largest planet in our solar system.

The infant is just 300,000 years old at most - compared to the 4.6-billion-year age of our Sun and its planets - and is more than 450 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus.

John Tobin, a Hubble Fellow student at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia, said: 'It may be even younger, depending on how fast it accumulated mass in the past.'

Currently about one-fifth the mass of the Sun, it is expected to pull in material from its surroundings to eventually match it.

The disk surrounding the young star contains at least enough ‘stuff’ to make seven Jupiters - the largest planet in our solar system.

Tobin, whose discovery is described in Nature, said: 'This very young object has all the elements of a solar system in the making.'

Called L1527 IRS, the young star resides in a stellar nursery known as the Taurus Cloud and is one of the closest examples of the earliest stage of star formation.

The astronomers used the state-of-the-art telescopes to detect both dust and carbon monoxide around the object.

They were the first observers to conclusively show the young star is surrounded by a rotating disk of material and the first to be able to measure the mass of the protostar itself.

By measuring radio waves coming from carbon monoxide in the disk they were able to show the rotation speed changes with the material’s distance from the star in the same fashion the orbital speeds of planets change with distance from the Sun.

Hsin-Fang Chiang, a post-doctoral fellow at Illinois University, said this pattern called Keplerian rotation 'marks one of the first essential steps toward forming planets.'

He said the disk is 'supported by its own rotation, will mediate the flow of material onto the protostar and allow the planet formation process to begin.'

Tobin said: 'This is the youngest protostar found thus far to show that characteristic in a surrounding disk.

'In many ways, this system looks much like we think our own solar system looked when it was very young.'

Previous observations from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii suggested the presence of a large disk surrounding the protostar.

This motivated the researchers to pursue high-resolution images confirming the presence of the disk and measuring its rotation.

The astronomers have received approval to improve their understanding of L1527 IRS by making high-precision observations with the world’s most complex telescope system ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) nearing completion in the Chilean Andes.

Tobin said: 'ALMA’s advanced capabilities will allow us to study more such objects at greater distances.

'With ALMA we will be able to learn more about how the disks form and how quickly the young stars grow to their full size and gain a much better understanding of how stars and their planetary systems begin their lives.'

David Clarke, professor of astronomy at Saint Mary’s University in Nova Scotia, Canada, reviewed the study for the journal and said it could be the ‘holy grail’ of star evolution.

He said: 'That nature has found a way to routinely bring together far-flung wisps of matter, condense it by 24 orders of magnitude, and form the nuclear engines responsible for illuminating the universe is at the same time astonishing and undeniable.

'Precisely what that mechanism is, however, is only now being understood by astronomers, and the paper by Tobin et al brings to bear a central and previously missing piece - the first detection and measurement of a truly embryonic star.

'Tobin and colleagues may not be the first to measure the mass of a protostar, but the protostar they have observed is by far the best example to date.

'With a mass 0.19 (10.04) that of the Sun its mass as a fraction of its surrounding envelope (0.2) is ten times smaller than the previous best example.

'Is L1527 IRS the holy grail of infrared astronomy and stellar evolution? That will be for historians of science to determine.

In the meantime it is undoubtedly a major discovery and future studies of it will help to broaden our understanding of how stars form.'
