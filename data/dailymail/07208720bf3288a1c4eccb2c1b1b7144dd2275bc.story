A hotelier has been jailed after he was caught flicking the V-sign at a speed camera and then pretending it was his dead father who was driving.

Vasille Georgiou, 48, was driving his Audi A4 sports car at 59mph in 40mph limit in Plymouth, Devon, when he made the gesture at a speed detection officer, a court heard.

He attempted to escape prosecution by blaming it on his father Stavros Georgiou – even though he had been dead for four years.

But the law caught up with him after a two year police investigation when officers began to ‘smell a rat’.

The former hairdresser turned publican was more camera shy when he arrived at Plymouth Crown Court today as he wore a motor bike crash helmet to cover his face.

The jury was told that Georgiou had managed to get away with two previous offences by saying his Cypriot father had been behind the wheel.

On one occasion he had been travelling at 104mph on the A38 in Devon in August 2005.

Recorder Stephen Parish said after each offence someone returned a form from Cyprus confirming that Stavros Georgiou had been driving the vehicle.

He said: ‘On three occasions over a period of seven years you attempted to pervert and in fact did pervert the course of public justice by giving the name of your father in Cyprus, Stavros Georgiou, as being the driver of your car which had been caught on speed cameras - on one occasion doing 104mph.’

During a two-year inquiry, officer in charge of the case, PC David Williams, contacted the Cypriot authorities where the truth was revealed.

Prosecutor Alistair Verheijen said the first speeding offence was in August 2005 on the A38 in Devon where he was caught doing 104mph in a Renault Clio Sport near the Devonport Interchange.

Police wrote to Georgiou as the registered keeper but he told officers it was his father that was driving – at which point he was still alive.

The Crown said because the ‘driver’ was a foreign national living in Cyprus the file was closed.

In June 2011 he was caught doing 46mph in a 30mph zone in Plymouth, again blaming his father – who by this point had been dead for three years.

He committed his third offence in January 2012 on the A374 in the city, when he was caught putting two fingers up to the camera.

Georgiou admitted two charges of attempting to pervert the course of public justice and he asked for a third count to be taken into consideration.

Defence barrister Nick Lewin said: ‘These offences are borne of arrogance and stupidity, someone trying to get the better of the system.’

He was jailed for four months and banned from driving for eight months by the court.

The Peninsula Road Safety Partnership said: ‘What Vasille Georgiou did was engage in a deliberate act which was long and protracted over a period of seven years avoiding prosecutions for safety camera offences.’
