Girls aged 14 and 15 were allegedly overheard plotting to stab maths teacher Alison Cray (pictured) at a school in Wales

Two schoolgirls arrested last week for allegedly plotting to kill a maths teacher at their school have been expelled.

The girls, aged 14 and 15, were arrested on Friday after a fellow pupil overheard them allegedly plotting to stab teacher Alison Cray.

When police searched them, they found a knife in the 15-year-old's schoolbag.

Now 1,000-pupil Cwmcarn High School, in Wales, has permanently excluded the pair, while police have released them on bail.

The schoolâ€™s chair of governors Gary Thomas praised the way in which the alleged murder plot had been acted upon 'swiftly'.

On a letter on Cwmcarnâ€™s website, he said: 'There are clear measures, policies and protocols in place to ensure that everyone is safe and everyone knows how to report any concerns.

'I am very proud of the school and particularly the way in which the pupils are educated to be responsible and report any concerns immediately.'

Ms Cray, 46, said she has worked as normal since the alleged incident which was 'all handled before it got to me'.

Police said a 15-year-old pupil from Newbridge was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill, possession of a bladed article on school premises and conspiracy to commit murder.

The 14-year-old girl from Risca was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

A Caerphilly Council spokesman said: 'We can confirm that concerns were raised about a pupil at Cwmcarn High School last week, which were swiftly dealt with by staff and Gwent Police.

The pair have now been permanently excluded from the school, and have also been released on police bail

'Support is now in place for both pupils and staff and we would like to assure parents that all appropriate steps were taken to respond effectively to the situation. We are now helping the Police with their enquiries.

'We can confirm that the two pupils have been issued with permanent exclusions and we are currently assessing their needs before recommending appropriate educational provision for each of the girls.'

Miss Cray has been at the school for more
 than 10 years and is described as being 'very kind and caring' on 
pupils social network sites.

According to the last school inspection: 
'The staff go the extra mile to provide high quality learning so that 
pupils of all abilities reach their potential.'

The schoolgirls were arrested just three days after another 15-year-old male pupil stabbed Ann Maguire to death at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds.

The RE teacher was stabbed in the neck during a lesson, and is thought to be the first teacher to be murdered in school.

Mother-of-two Mrs Maguire was credited with inspiring three generations of pupils at the school, and was just months from retiring after 40 years at the college.
