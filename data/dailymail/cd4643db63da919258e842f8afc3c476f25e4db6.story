Retailer Men's Wearhouse has fired founder and executive chairman George Zimmer, the bearded icon of the retailer's television commercials for 28 years.

Since the mid-1980s Zimmer had appeared in the company's TV commercials along with his slogan 'You're going to like the way you look. I guarantee it.'

The retailer announced Zimmer's departure on Wednesday morning and afterwards he released his own statement in which he said that he and the board had disagreed about the company's direction for several months and the board 'inappropriately has chosen to silence my concerns.'

Zimmer, 64, issued the following statement: 'Over the last 40 years, I have built The Men’s Wearhouse into a multi-billion dollar company with amazing employees and loyal customers who value the products and service they receive at The Men’s Wearhouse.

'Over the past several months I have expressed my concerns to the Board about the direction the company is currently heading.

'Instead of fostering the kind of dialogue in the Boardroom that has, in part, contributed to our success, the Board has inappropriately chosen to silence my concerns by terminating me as an executive officer.'

Men's Wearhouse gave no reason for the abrupt firing of Zimmer, who built Men's Wearhouse from one small Texas store using a cigar box as a cash register to one of the North America's largest specialty men's clothiers with 1,143 locations.

Men's Wearhouse really took off in the 1980s after Zimmer started staring in his company's TV commercials

According to Business Week, Men's Wearhouse targets the common man, with 'the neatly displayed clothes in Zimmer's stores [being] designed to cater to the unpretentious guy who wants to do as little as possible to maintain his wardrobe.'

The business currently has more than 1,200 stores under the Men's Wearhouse, Moores, K&G and Tux brands, employing 15,261 people.

Zimmer,
who handed over his CEO title to Douglas Ewert in 2011, was the 
company's personable, down-to-earth face, his slogan a cultural 
touchstone.

He was known for his usual style of 
corporate management, which was regarded as cutting-edge by some and as unorthodox by 
others.

In June 2004 spiritual guru Deepak Chopra joined the company’s board. Some executives wondered what value he would bring to the company, but Zimmer argued that he would contribute ideas on social responsibility and team-building.

The exit of Zimmer won't entirely 
delete him from the brand's image though, as the company has more than 
500 hours of footage of him and the legal rights to continue to use him 
image, analysts told Buzzfeed.com.

Zimmer opened the first Men's Wearhouse clothing store in Texas in 1973 and grew it into a business including more than 1,200 stores

George Zimmer was born in New York City to a Jewish family.

After attending grade schools in Scarsdale, New York, he received an A.B. in Economics in 1970 from Washington University in St. Louis.

Upon graduation, he worked as a substitute teacher before joining his father in the clothing manufacturing business.

In 1971 he worked as a purchasing agent and salesman in Hong Kong for six months for his father's coat manufacturing business.

In 1973, he and his college roommate opened the first Men's Wearhouse store in Texas, which sold $10 slacks and $25 polyester sport coats, in Houston.

His personal car was a van with the company logo on the side and clothing racks in the back.

The company aired its first TV commercial in the 1970s when commercials for clothing were rare.

Zimmer starred in his first commercial in 1986, in which he said the 'I guarantee it' line in his instantly recognizable gravelly baritone voice.

Men's Wearhouse kept expanding, 
focusing on large markets where business was sluggish to take advantage 
of lower real estate costs.

It also expanded beyond sports coats and 
trousers to casual sportswear in the 1980s and then went into the tuxedo
rental business in 2000.

The company went public in 1992, and the company has been cited by Fortune magazine as one of the top 100 best companies to work for.

Outside of work, Zimmer's experience caring for his mother, who died of cancer, led him to support research into the therapeutic use of MDMA, and for his efforts to legalize cannabis.

In 2010 he donated $170,500 to support California's Proposition 19.

Shares of Men's Wearhouse fell nearly 2 percent, or 65 cents, to $36.82 in early afternoon trading (store photographed in Oakland, California)

There is speculation that Zimmer may have struggled with his change of role from being a hands-on manager to executive chairman.

‘We believe that despite Zimmer's planned transition to a smaller role at the company, he had difficulty letting go of the reins and the leadership of the business,'’ Richard Jaffe, a retail analyst at Stifel & Co., told USA Today.

‘We believe that this led to a conflict with the board and his subsequent termination.'

Other experts have predicted that the time may be right for a repositioning of the brand to attract a younger audience who may have been put off by Zimmer’s aging catchphrase.

On
Wednesday afternoon, the company's website still prominently 
spotlighted Zimmer, calling him 'The Man Behind The Brand' and linking 
to YouTube videos of 'the man in action.'

The
abrupt departure comes a week after Men's Wearhouse reported that its 
fiscal first-quarter profit increased 23 percent, helped by stronger 
profit margins and an earlier prom season.

The timing of the announcement was usual - it happened Wednesday morning just as the company's annual 
shareholder meeting had been set to take place. The company delayed the 
meeting but didn't give a new date.

The
company said the purpose of postponing the annual meeting is to 
re-nominate the existing board of directors without Zimmer. It said the 
board expects to discuss with Zimmer the extent, if any, and terms of 
'his ongoing relationship' with the company.

The news shocked analysts and corporate governance experts, who tried to speculate what happened.

'This is very rare to fire a founder. 
Founders are generally entrenched in the company,' said Eleanor Bloxham,
CEO of The Value Alliance, a board advisory firm.

Zimmer owned 1.8 million shares of Men's Wearhouse as of the company's May 9 proxy filing, a 3.5 percent stake in the company.

Zimmer served as CEO from 1991 until

latest proxy, he holds a 3.5% stake.
