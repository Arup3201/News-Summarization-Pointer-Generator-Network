Should Ince move to another club in England, then Blackpool would be entitled to compensation as he is under 23.

Blackpool believe they could command £8m owing to the fact Palace paid a £1.5m loan fee in January. 

Ince has talked with Harry Redknapp's club but any pending transfer tribunal fee may have a bearing on his final destination.
