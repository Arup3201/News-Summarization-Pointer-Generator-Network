One of London's top hotels is about to set tongue's wagging, with a new dog stay experience that invites pooches into a selection of their  luxurious rooms.

ME London will offer canine visitors an ‘Aura host’ who will be on-hand to tailor their stay, organise  grooming, spa treatments, birthday parties, gifts, anniversary celebrations and any walking that they should require.

For the well-heeled, hosts can arrange personal canine shopping trips to ensure they are kitted out in the latest luxury fashion, Louis Vuitton’s leashes, Paul’s Smith’s dog collars – nothing is too much trouble.

The hotel will also treat its furry guests to luxuries including chef prepared food, bathrobes, towels and shampoo.

Last weekend the world's first dog reviewer, Napoleon, kitted out with his own video camera, took a sneak peek inside the hotel.

Napoleon was spoilt with an in-room dining experience serving delights such as terrine of bone marrow & oxtail with sweet baby turnips and fillet steak with rice and light gravy.

The property has 157 guest rooms, including 16 suites and ultra-luxurious Suite ME, a two-storey penthouse located in the turret of the building.
