In bankrupt Detroit, all sources of revenue to pay back creditors are on the table - even selling off the city's beloved art collection at the Detroit Institute of Arts.

The world-famous 60,000-piece collection includes works by Rembrandt, Matisse, Cézanne, Degas, van Gogh and Gauguin - as well as the original Howdy Doody TV show puppet.

Collectors estimate that the entire collections could be worth up to $2.5billion - a sizable payment toward the city's $18 billion long-term debt.

Doomed? The Detroit Institute of Arts and its $2.5billion collection has moved into the cross hairs after the city declared bankruptcy

Some are beginning to question whether the city can afford an estimated $2.5billion art collection when it faces dire financial straights from its $18billion bankruptcy

Prized: Two of the museum's most prized possessions include 'Self Portrait with Straw Hat,' estimated to be worth $60 million, and another Vincent van Gogh titled 'Portrait of the Postman Joseph Roulin'

Unlike most other major art museums, which are owned by trusts and operated separately from the cities where they reside, the Detroit Institute of Arts is a city-owned facility.

A spokesman for Kevyn Orr, the state-appointed emergency manager of the troubled city, said the art museum collection could become a bargaining chip in negotiations with creditors.

'We haven't proposed selling any asset. But we haven't taken any asset off the table. We can't. We cannot negotiate in good faith with our creditors by taking assets off the table,' spokesman Bill Nowling told the New York Times.

'And all of our creditors have asked about the worth of the DIA. And we've told them that they're welcome to find out.'

The art collection, housed in a grand Beaux-Arts museum built in 1927, has been one of the cultural bright points in the beleaguered city.

Expensive: According to art dealers, the most expensive piece in the gallery is Henri Matisse's 'The Window,' pictured, with an estimated value of $150 million

Wow: Frederic Church's 'Cotopaxi' from 1862, pictured, was purchased by the Founders Society with funds from several sources in 1976. the awe-inspiring 7-foot panorama has an estimated worth of $70 million

Spectacular: This 17th-Century French artist Nicolas Poussin's masterpiece 'Selene and Endymion' hangs on the DIA's walls after the Founders Society bought it in 1936. It has an estimated value of $30 million

Rothko: The Founders Society also purchased an impressive 1963 Mark Rothko, pictured, titled 'Orange Brown,' which is now estimated to be worth $70 million

Famed: Rembrandt's 'The Visitation' from 1640, which depicts Mary, pregnant with Jesus, in a meeting with her cousin Elizabeth, who is pregnant at the time with john the Baptist, hangs on the DIA wall

According to The Detroit Free Press, which consulted respected art dealers, the most expensive piece in the gallery is Henri Matisse's 'The Window' with an estimated value of $150 million.

The City of Detroit purchased the 1916 oil on canvas masterpiece in 1992. The piece is a subtle abstract interior work showcasing the French-born painter's reknown style.

Two impressive paintings in the DIA's collection are worth an estimated $100 million each - Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 'The Wedding Dance,' bought by the City of Detroit in 1930, and Tintoretto, 'The Dreams of Men,' purchased by the now bankrupt city in 1923.

Bruegel's circa 1566 oil on oak panel was snapped up by DIA director William Valentiner for $38,000 70 years ago and since then its value has increased some 2600 times.

The enormous 7-by-12 feet Tintoretto masterpiece, was installed on the ceiling of the DIA.

The next most valuable piece, according to art dealers, is Andy Warhol's 'Double Self Portrait,' which is estimated to be worth $80 million. The Founders Society purchased the 1967 work a year after it was completed.

The Founders Society also purchased an impressive 1963 Mark Rothko titled 'Orange Brown,' which is now estimated to be worth $70 million while Rembrandt's 'The Visitation' from 1640 has an estimated value of $60 million.

One of the one-of-a-kind pieces housed at the DIA is the first ever doll used on the Howdy Doody TV show

Bright spot: More than 600,000 people visited the museum last year. Seen here is 'The Wedding Dance' by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which is estimated to cost $100 million

Work: Jan van Eyck's circa 1440 work 'Saint Jerome in his Study' was bought by the city in 1925 and today is worth some $50 million

A famed Diego Rivera mural is another of the nearly priceless works of art at the DIA

Plagued by some of the highest crime and unemployment rates in the country, the once-thriving Motor City has become a shadow of itself. Hundreds of thousands of residents have fled to the suburbs. Entire blocks are blighted by abandoned streets.

But, the Detroit Institute of Arts continues to draw people downtown. The museum had some 600,000 visitors last year. Three neighboring counties - home to Detroit's wealthy suburbs - agreed to raise a tax to support the museum.

Any attempts to liquidate the museum's collection could face resistance from arts patrons, who still donate tens of millions of dollars a year to the DIA.

Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette weighed in last month and attempted to bar any future creditors from seeking the sale of the city's works of art.

He wrote a legal opinion arguing that the collection is 'held by a charitable trust for the people of Michigan' and that the city doesn't actually own the art - so the city can't sell the art.

Patrons are also upset. They say the city would be irreversibly losing a part of itself.

'We're talking about selling history,' patron Rod Spencer told CBS News. 'How can you sell family history?'

1. Henri Matisse's 'The Window,' with an estimated value of $150 million, is the gallery's most expensive work of art, according to art dealers consulted by The Detroit Free Press. The City of Detroit purchased the 1916 oil on canvas masterpiece in 1992.
