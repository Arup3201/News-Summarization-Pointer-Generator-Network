Steven Gerrard was able to laugh at himself after being taunted about his slip against Chelsea.

Fans up and down the country have sung about the moment the Liverpool captain allowed Demba Ba to score for Chelsea at Anfield last month, with the Blues' win massively denting Gerrard's side's title hopes.

Manchester City are now on the brink of a second title in three years, with a point against West Ham on Sunday enough to claim the trophy. Liverpool play Newcastle at Anfield.

And at Liverpool's end-of-season awards do, Gerrard said: 'The biggest message when you sign for this club is you never get too high when you win an award or trophy and you never get too down when one slips away - literally slips away.

'You continue to fight game by game but for me I stand here really proud of my team-mates and have a huge belief that if this group of players stick together and we can make the right additions in the summer the future is bright for the club.'

Liverpool also saw a three-goal lead slip at Crystal Palace on Monday when the hosts came back from 3-0 down to draw and all-but extinguish Gerrard's title hopes.
