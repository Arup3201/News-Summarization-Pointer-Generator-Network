Donnelly, a four-year veteran of the force, reveied the Police Combat Cross - the department's second-highest honor - on June 10 for his bravery arresting a gunman who shot at him in May 2012.

The 27-year-old was even pictured shaking Mayor Bill De Blasio's hand at the ceremony held at One Police Plaza.

Following the event, Donnelly went out drinking to celebrate and decided to sleep over at a friend's house in Woodlawn.

It the early hours of June 11, Donnelly was so drunk he 
wandered out of his friend's apartment wearing only his underwear. He then reentered the building and broke down the door of another apartment, thinking it was his friend's, the New York Daily News reported.

The unidentified 30-year-old woman woke up from the noise, and claims he proceeded to punch her more than 20 times and she tried to flee.

Donnelly eventually left and sources told the Daily News that he took a swig of milk from the woman's refrigerator before stepping out.

He was later captured on surveillance footage, and police used the images for wanted pictures before realizing the suspect was one of their own.

Donnelly was awarded the medal just over two years after he arrested a teen gunman terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood in May 2012.

He was off-duty while driving with a friend to meet his partner when several men ran from a park while being chased by a gun-wielding Javon Julien.

Julien, 19, fired a shot at the men while running past Donnelly’s car.

The cop shouted at Julien to stop, but the teen instead shot out Donnelly’s driver’s side mirror. The officer fired back, striking Julien four times before chasing down and arresting him.

Julien was given eight years in prison for his shooting spree.

The Bronx DA is still deciding whether to file charges against Donnelly.
