Blackburn winger Josh King has expressed his frustration at a lack of playing time at the club.

The 22-year-old played for Norway against England in midweek but has only started two games for Blackburn this season with one being in the Capital One Cup.

King, who joined from Manchester United, said: 'I did a very good pre-season and was surprised when I did not start the first match of the season against Cardiff. I came back from holiday in good shape and heard from people in the team that I was one of the very best players in the running.

'It is very frustrating. The situation in Blackburn is very strange. Had I scored a hat-trick at Wembley, it is still not certain I would start for Blackburn in the next match.

'The coach has his reasons. I just have to respect them and keep working hard.'
