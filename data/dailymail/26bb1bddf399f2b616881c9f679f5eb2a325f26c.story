Benefits Street star White Dee was spotted enjoying an all-expenses-paid trip to Majorca – despite claiming to be too depressed to work.

She was seen taking in the sun and splashing around in the pool at the TRH hotel in Magaluf at a private pool party before heading off on a bar crawl, where drinkers paid £25 a ticket for her company. She was not paid for her appearance. 

In one photo she appears to be enjoying a £500 bottle of Moet champagne, while in others she lounges by the poolside with a fruity cocktail.

In another she is seen laughing alongside a group of topless women.

Dee – real name Deidre Kelly – was invited to the bash by an American singer, with whom she shares an agent.

She flew out to the popular resort on 
Wednesday, and stayed for three days before she is due to  head home to 
the notorious James Turner Street.

It
 was there, on the first night of the holiday she attended the event by 
Carnage Magalluf– who insist she was no paid for the appearance and was 
only a guest.

Under the current benefits regime, Dee is allowed to undertake work and keep claiming disability living allowance.

But claimants must inform the Department for Work and Pensions immediately if their condition changes, and proof that Dee is not in fact depressed could lead to an investigation into her payments.

The DWP said that it would not discuss individual circumstances.

Alan Collinson, Carnage events manager, said he had not watched the show and didn't know Dee was 'depressed'.

He said: She's a good lass. She came across as a good laugh, and there was quite a good turnout for this time of year.

'She's off out tonight with us on a bar crawl. I don't think she is a big drinker though - she told me she prefers tea and biscuits.'

Mr Collinson said the £500 bottle of champagne that Dee was drinking had been given to her for free.

She continues to receive disability living allowance – of around £10,000 a year – on grounds of depression.

The trip was organised by her agent, Barry Tomes, who told MailOnline the holiday was a pick-me-up to battle her depression, which is preventing her from working.

He said: ‘We’re trying to give her a bit of light-hearted fun. We’ve told her that if she can conquer depression we can make you a living and you won’t be on benefits any more.

'She can’t afford a holiday – the benefits aren’t enough to pay for it’. 

‘But she still takes daily medication.
 Until we set that right I won’t sign big things. We’ve been offered TV,
 a book, record deals – which we’ve turned down.’

He
 said Dee had been invited out on the insistence of Brooke Nickerson, a 
country singer who shares her agent – and is said to have struck up a 
close friendship with the so-called ‘mother of the street’ from the hit 
Channel 4 series.

He said: ‘Brooke’s having a few days break from recording, and she said invite Dee.

'We got a big pool party going with Dee hosting – we said you’ll have to pay her expenses so they did. It doesn’t earn her any money.

Dee became the face of Benefits Street, a television series which pulled in more than five million but also shocked viewers across Britain - attracting more than a thousand complaints.

The number of viewers of Benefits Street was the highest for the channel since the paralympics was aired on Channel 4 in 2012.

Early episodes from the series included confessions from residents that they had fraudulently claimed benefits.

Another resident Danny Smith showed the cameras his shoplifting techniques which included removing safety tags without damaging clothes and how to dodge alarms.

After the episode, 200 complains were made raising concerns that the television was providing criminals with techniques to follow which launched a police investigation.

In the series, James Clarke, known as Fungi, admitted to spending his hand-out on alcohol. In the first episode of the series he also pretends to be an official Big Issue salesman in order to earn extra cash.

Fungi, 44, has now said that he was made homeless after the series and has since been sleeping rough.
