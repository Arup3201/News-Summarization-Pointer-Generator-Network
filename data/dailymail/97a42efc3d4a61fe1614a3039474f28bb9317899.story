A video of the wife of a police officer squirting tabasco sauce into the mouth of her adopted son has been shown to jurors.

Jessica Beagley stands accused of child abuse after she was filmed by the Dr Phil show using the method to punish the seven-year-old for misbehaving at school and then lying about it.

They also heard audio of the boy screaming as he was forced to stand in a freezing cold shower.

Accused: Jessica Beagley pictured in court on the first day of her child abuse trial - she is said to have punished her son by forcing him to drink Tabasco sauce

The jury was shown video from Dr Phil of Beagley administering the punishment to her adopted son

Prosecutors say Beagley, of Anchorage, Alaska, went beyond 'what would be considered reasonable parental discipline'.

But her defence lawyer William Ingaldson said she resorted to unconventional disciplinary methods because more traditional forms of punishment had not worked with the boy.

Beagley, along with her police officer husband, adopted the boy and his twin brother from a Russian orphanage after their parents abandoned them, Ingaldson said.

The boys were taken there after Russian investigators found their family living in a shack, where the boys slept on shelves in an armoire.

He said the couple, who also have four biological children, 'thought this was their chance to make a difference in kids' lives'.

Hot: Beagley squirted the hot sauce into the mouth of her seven-year-old son as punishment

Anchorage Police were notified about the case after viewers of the self-improvement talk show Dr Phil saw the footage.

It had been submitted as a nine-minute video for a November episode titled Mommy Confessions.

The video, made in October 2010, shows Beagley asking the boy what happens when he lies. He replies, in tears, saying: 'I get hot sauce.'

The video shows Beagley putting the hot sauce in the boy's mouth.

She then tells him not to spit it out.

When he admits to lying, she allows him to spit out the hot sauce.

She then explains to the child that he is going to get in a cold shower for lying about misbehavior at school.

He had been wriggling in his seat and sword-fighting with pencils.
