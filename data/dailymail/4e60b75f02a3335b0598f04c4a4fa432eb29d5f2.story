A New Jersey man who said he was high on drugs and hearing voices when he fatally beat an elderly man with a sauce pan has been convicted of murder.

The Record reports that a Bergen County jury deliberated for about 90 minutes Tuesday before convicting 22-year-old Edwin Estrada, of Cliffside Park.

He also was found guilty of weapons offenses, burglary, robbery and credit-card theft charges.

Prosecutors say Estrada attacked and robbed 88-year-old Vincent Leuzzi in the victim's Fairview home in July 2010.

Estrada claimed he was not legally responsible for the murder because he was high on PCP and marijuana and was urged on by the voice of the devil.

Leuzzi died of blunt force trauma caused by at least nine blows.

North Jersey reports he now faces possible life in prison and a minimum of 30 years.

An
 expert witness for the prosecution testified Estrada fabricated his 
claims, and that they were at odds with his presence of mind later that 
day to go shopping and get dinner before leaving town.

'I tend to agree with the state's psychiatrist that it was a manipulation and not true,' said Leuzzi's stepdaughter Filomena Mazzone.

Defense attorney John Pieroni said the appeal process could take years.

'I'm
 greatly disappointed,' he said. 'It's clear that the jurors did not in 
my opinion properly consider the psychiatric testimony as to diminished 
capacity.'
