James McArthur has moved to quell the possibility of his astonishing tussle with Nigel Pearson spiralling into a storm by insisting he took the touchline strangle as a joke.

The Leicester manager was widely condemned after placing both hands around McArthur’s throat during the defeat against Crystal Palace on Saturday. He had reacted to being accidentally knocked over by the player.

But the Palace midfielder has surprisingly brushed off the altercation, claiming it was in jest.

'Leicester City Football Club would like to clarify its position relative to its manager, Nigel Pearson. 

'Contrary to media speculation on Sunday evening, Nigel remains the Club’s First Team Manager. Reports to the contrary are inaccurate and without foundation.

'Nigel, his staff and the first team squad are entirely focused on Tuesday night’s trip to Arsenal and our continued efforts to secure our position in the Barclays Premier League.'

‘These things happen in football,’ he said. ‘He says it was only a joke. I did not know that at the time but he said it was a joke so I will take it that way and move on.’

Pearson was seen grinning while he pinned McArthur to the King Power Stadium turf and is unlikely to face any retrospective action from the FA because referee Lee Mason saw the incident.

Either way, it isn’t something McArthur wants to dwell on.

‘There is nothing in it in my part. I am not bothered by it,’ he added. ‘You have heated moments in football. Emotions are high. It is not something that is going to play on my mind.’

McArthur’s laidback attitude to the choke could save Pearson from the sack after a weekend which looked likely to be his last in charge.

The Leicester board’s patience with the 51-year-old is wearing thin, although they did stick by him on Sunday night hours after it emerged he would be on his way out.

'Leicester City Football Club would like to clarify its position relative to its manager, Nigel Pearson,’ a statement read.

'Contrary to media speculation on Sunday evening, Nigel remains the Club’s First Team Manager. Reports to the contrary are inaccurate and without foundation.

'Nigel, his staff and the first team squad are entirely focused on Tuesday night’s trip to Arsenal and our continued efforts to secure our position in the Barclays Premier League.'

McArthur and Pearson do have previous after a summer transfer saga which lasted weeks.

McArthur appeared destined to join the Foxes before their return to the Premier League but opted for a move to Palace instead.

Pearson said: ‘I have no problem with the lad. He’s a likeable lad. I’m as disappointed as he was with how things (his transfer) panned out.

‘But it’s the other football club (Wigan) which was involved in it who take absolute responsibility for anything that wasn’t quite right. And a certain manager (then Wigan boss Uwe Rosler), who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut.’
