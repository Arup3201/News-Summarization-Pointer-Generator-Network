She's an award-winning fashion designer beloved by the stars, but even Stella McCartney doesn't always get it spot on when it comes to style.

The mother-of-four went a little too wild for leopard print last night wearing head-to-toe clothing in the design, as well as matching accessories.

The outfit was all from her own spring 2013 collection and was worth a total of £2,010.

Arty crowd: The designer daughter of Sir Paul 
McCartney was attending a dinner in Miami to celebrate the launch of 
video artist Bill Viola's new exhibition

The designer daughter of Sir Paul McCartney was attending a dinner in Miami to celebrate the launch of video artist Bill Viola's new exhibition which will be on display at The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) North Miami until March.

She used the opportunity to showcase her love of animal print wearing a loose fit 'Viole' leopard print top worth £300 with matching jogging trousers, £625. She also wore £425 canvas wedges in leopard print and carried a fold over tote bag in the same design which costs £660 from her website.

Not for all: Last week Stella was crowned the 
Designer of the Year and Designer Brand of the Year at the British 
Fashion Awards but her style isn't always to everyone's taste

The trend is already catching on as today singer Jessie J was pictured wearing the top and matching leggings as she attended ITV's studios. But she didn't take the style as far as Stella as teamed the outfit with brown boots and a cream furry coat.

Trendsetter: Singer Jessie J has already embraced the trend but she didn't don the matching shoes and bag like Stella

When she launched her official Team GB kit for the London 2012 Olympics, many complained that it was 'too blue' and didn't feature enough of the union flag.

But her optical illusion collection this year has been a hit with celebs including Kate Winslet, Kate Moss and Yasmin Le Bon, who have all stepped out in the flattering design.

As Jessie J has proved, her animal print designs are also sure to be hit - but perhaps not everyone will be brave enough to wear them from top to bottom.
