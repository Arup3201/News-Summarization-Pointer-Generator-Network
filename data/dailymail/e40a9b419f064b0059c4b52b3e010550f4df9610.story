The home-to-work commute becomes tedious for all of us after a while.

So imagining the hassle of having to cross five states just to get to your job.

Such was the case for Ian Bearce, who travels from his family home in Minnesota to his office in New York City each week.

In order to liven up one of the trips, the working dad decided to film both legs of the journey and put it together as a time lapse video.

Scroll down for video 

Early start: Ian Bearce commutes from his home in Minneapolis to his office in New York City every week. He filmed the journey recently, starting with his pre-dawn drive to the airport

Breakfast: A quick bite before the flight

Work day starts: Bearce logs onto his email before take off

Plane to train: Bearce lands at JFK airport and jumps straight on the subway to Manhattan 

Hello New York: And from the subway he walks to his office in the city

Desk job: The family man's computer in Manhattan is adorned with pictures of his wife and kids

Bearce refers to himself as a 'super-commuter' in the caption of the video he uploaded to Vimeo.

He documents both his trip to Manhattan and his return to Minneapolis.

The three-minute film affectionately finishes with the father returning home to his family and building a tent fort with his children.

The businessman was no doubt inspired to put the clip together by his wife, Megan Bearce, who has written a book about couples who have long-distance commutes and how they make it work.

A trained therapist, she specialises in long-distance relationships.

The book says there are three million people in the United States who are 'super commuting'.

It also 'offers practical guidance for navigating not only the commute itself but also the ins and outs of staying together while living apart'.
