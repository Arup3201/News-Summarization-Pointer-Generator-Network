Chelsea team news

Diego Costa was one of the 22 Chelsea players who left London for Slovenia on Tuesday ahead of the Champions League Group G clash at Maribor.

Chelsea beat Maribor 6-0 two weeks ago during a four-game absence for Costa, who returned from his persistent hamstring problems to play in last Saturday's defeat of QPR.

Striker Loic Remy (groin) and midfielder John Obi Mikel (knee) are the only injury absentees, while third-choice goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer is ineligible for Champions League competition.

Striker Didier Drogba could start against Maribor if manager Jose Mourinho chooses to rotate his squad

France striker Remy is likely to be out until after the forthcoming international break.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho may rotate his Barclays Premier League-leading side, with Saturday's match at Liverpool in mind.

But he was less than impressed by the performance of his fringe players in the Capital One Cup defeat of League Two Shrewsbury last week, so he must get the balance of selection right to record Chelsea's third win from four matches in this season's competition.

The squad is the same which played QPR, plus Cesar Azpilicueta, the full-back who has now completed his three-match domestic suspension for his dismissal at Crystal Palace.

Victory may secure the 2012 winners' place in the last 16, depending on the result in Schalke's match with Sporting Lisbon.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Chelsea’s 6-0 win over NK Maribor on MD3 was their record victory in the Champions League.

Chelsea have kept a clean sheet in nine of their last 14 Champions League games.

Following his goal in the last game against Maribor, Didier Drogba has scored in his 12th consecutive Champions League season. Only Raul (14) has managed a longer such run.

Eden Hazard scored as many goals in Chelsea’s 6-0 win over Maribor on the last matchday (2) as he had in his previous 23 CL appearances.

NK Maribor have scored only four goals in their nine Champions League games.

Since winning their first ever Champions League game versus Dinamo Kiev in September 1999, Maribor have lost five and drawn three of their eight CL matches.

No goalkeeper have made more saves (17) in the 2014-15 Champions League than Maribor’s Jasmin Handanovic.

Maribor have not kept a clean sheet in any of their previous four Champions League games in Slovenia.
