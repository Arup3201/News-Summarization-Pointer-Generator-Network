Things got very harey for this tourist when she visited a tiny island off Japan that's been overrun with rabbits.

After offering them some food, she was chased down a road by a stampede of wild bunnies in this adorable video posted on Reddit.

Known as Rabbit Island, Okunoshima was used as the secret base for the Japanese Imperial Army’s lethal gas operation during World War Two.

Stampeding rabbits: Bunnies swarmed around this tourist after she offered them food

Stop rabbiting! The rabbits ran from all directions to chase after the woman

From 1929 to 1945, more than 6,000 
tons of poison gas were manufactured on the remote island, and the 
program was shrouded in secrecy.

For 16 years, Okunoshima was left off maps, and workers who produced
 the five types of poison gas - which were mostly used in warfare in 
China - were told to keep the factories a secret.

But somewhere along the line rabbits were introduced and - as rabbits tend to do - they bred fast. 

Some sources claim they were brought to the island to test the effects of the poison and released by workers when the war ended.

Others sources say that a group of schoolchildren on a field trip released eight of the animals in 1971.

Now tourists flock to the 2.5 mile wide Inland Sea island off the coast of Takehara to feed and pet the hundreds of bunnies that call it home.

And it's easy to see why.
