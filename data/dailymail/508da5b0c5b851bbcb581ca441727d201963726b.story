A sham marriage operation was uncovered after a couple who could not speak the same language had to resort to an iPhone translation app in the register office, a court heard.

The cross-Channel ‘delivery service’ scam which brought in brides from Eastern Europe was well organised and was compared by prosecutors to the retailer Amazon.

Up to ten women were ferried from Dunkirk to Dover before tying the knot.

The brides-to-be were ‘ordered’ by prospective Asian grooms with ‘questionable’ immigration status – many foreign students desperate to stay in Britain.

One bride, a mother-of-six, was said to have booked a flight back to Prague in the Czech Republic within hours of tying the knot.

Another groom was said to have used an iPhone app so he could talk to his wife-to-be. Avtar Singh and Melania Jakabova first aroused suspicion when they registered notice of intention to marry in Shrewsbury in 2013.

The officiating registrar, Paul Ainscough, said they seemed unable to talk to each other without the help of the app.

Describing the couple’s big day, on March 5, Mr Ainscough added: ‘The wedding seemed to be a choreographed performance. The hem of the bride’s dress was soiled and she wore it without any deportment or sense of occasion.’

Indian national Singh, 37, of Wolverhampton, admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and awaits sentence. His bride Jakabova remains at large.

Now two couples have gone on trial accused of taking part in the scam. Manchester Crown Court heard Hamid Mushtaq, 24, of Manchester, and Pavlina Kratka, 28, got married before going to a local KFC to celebrate.

And, just a few hours after her marriage to Waqas Hussein, 25, – also of Manchester – Blanka Farkasova, 35, allegedly booked herself a flight back to Prague.

Prosecutors told the jury at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) that one bride booked a flight to Prague within hours of tying the knot while a second couple went to KFC to celebrate their union

All four deny conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.

Registrars became suspicious when they saw that the couples interacted awkwardly.

Czech-born Klement Buncik, 43, who denies nine charges of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, was allegedly mastermind of the operation, bringing in brides between September 2012 and June last year. They were Czech nationals and therefore EU citizens, a court heard.

Darren Preston, prosecuting, said: ‘This is a delivery service, but unlike a delivery you might order from Amazon, [Buncik] is delivering women.’

The trial continues.
