Nightmare: Peter Lowe, 68, punched a pregnant woman and tried to grab her baby

A pensioner who repeatedly punched a pregnant woman in the stomach while trying to steal her baby girl has been jailed for two years.

Peter Lowe, 68, has been branded 'every parent's nightmare' after trying to grab the baby girl from her mother's arms during an attempted abduction.

Lowe punched the terrified woman and repeatedly tried to wrest the baby from her grasp, a Grimsby Crown Court heard.

On June 27 at Grimsby town centre bus station, the 20-year-old mother was leaning forward to put her 11-month-old daughter in a pushchair when Lowe delivered a hard punch to the side of her stomach. She was four months pregnant at the time.

The court heard she lost her balance and lost her grip on the baby, causing the child to fall through her arms.

Lowe, from Cleethorpes, then grasped at the baby's arm but the mother refused to let go and was able to keep a hold of her.

He then grappled with the woman, grabbing her arm and squeezing it.Â 

Struggling to free the baby, Lowe - who suffers with mental health problems - again punched the mother in the stomach, causing her to panic that she might lose her unborn baby.

The woman, whose name was not said in court, fell to her knees and Lowe grabbed at the baby's foot and hand, trying to pull the child from her mother's grip.

Chloe Fairley, prosecuting, said: 'Her daughter was screaming and crying out.'

A man who was passing by and witnessed the attack unfold started shouting at Lowe, who quickly ran away.

He was later arrested after his description was sent out by police.

Andrew Bailey, mitigating, said it was a 'nasty' incident and Lowe's behaviour was 'every parent's nightmare.'

It was a spur-of-the-moment offence and Lowe claimed he would 'probably just have held' the baby.

'He presents a risk and that needs to be reduced,' said Mr Bailey.

Jailing Lowe for two years, Judge David Tremberg said: 'It's every parent's nightmare to have a stranger try to abduct their child, particularly in a case like this when it was a young woman who was on her own and 17 weeks' pregnant, and against whom you used some violence.

'Let this be a lesson to you and let this be the last time you ever appear before a criminal court.'

Lowe had been in custody for seven-and-a-half months.

Court heard that he had shown remorse and suffered from mental health difficulties, including schizophrenia.

Lowe had worked as a street cleaner, but had to leave that job because of taunts and abuse from children.
