Tory MP Andrew Mitchell could be forced to sell his family home to pay for the costs of the legal fees he is running up over ‘Plebgate’.

The former Chief Whip is facing a £200,000 libel action by the police constable who refused to let him cycle through the Downing Street gates – and Mr Mitchell has told friends that the cost of defending the action could force him to sell his £1 million home in Islington, North London.

PC Toby Rowland, who insists that Mr Mitchell used the term ‘f****** plebs’ during the exchange in September 2012, has been backed by the Police Federation in his legal battle.

PC Rowland claims that Mr Mitchell has falsely accused him of ‘fabricating the damning allegation’ about the remark, and is seeking aggravated slander.

Mr Rowland’s lawyer has claimed the officer ‘has been very seriously injured in his personal and professional reputation and suffered great distress, humiliation and upset’.

It is understood Mr Mitchell has already incurred legal fees of more than £40,000 fighting the defamation case – and fears that if costs spiral out of control he may have to sell his house.

Last night he said: ‘I have always told the truth about the incident. I was fitted up. If it can happen to a Government Minister, it can happen to anyone’.
