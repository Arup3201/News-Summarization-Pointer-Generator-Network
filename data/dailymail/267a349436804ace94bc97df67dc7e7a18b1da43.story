An annual dance thrown by the Queen for staff at her Balmoral residence has been put back a day as she anxiously awaits the result of the referendum.

Held by successive monarchs since the days of Queen Victoria, the dance is one of the highlights of the royal calendar and traditionally is held on Thursday of this week each year.

Now estate managers have postponed the dance until Friday so that estate workers have the chance to cast their vote.

The Queen has decided to delay the traditional annual ball by one day so members of the estate can vote 

Buckingham Palace has insisted the monarch is remaining determinedly neutral over the referendum 

The Queen's deep love of Scotland is well known, with Balmoral Castle (pictured) her favourite residence 

But locals are already asking whether the ball will turn out to be a celebration - or a wake.

The party is held in the Ballroom of Balmoral Castle, the largest room in Queen’s private and most beloved residence, which is decorated with Highland scenes by Landseer and Carl Haag as well as silver statues by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm.

Invitations to the Ghillies Ball are hugely sought after – sent to estate staff, a handful of the Queen’s closest neighbours on Royal Deeside and notable members of the local community.

Unlike other royal functions, the sovereign and members of her family – which this year include Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew – mingle and dance Scottish reels arm-in-arm with their guests, washed down with copious amounts of punch. 

Few pictures exist of the exclusive Ghillies Ball but the Queen has always enjoyed a party (left at a film premier in 1957 and right during a dance on the crowed floor at The Royal Caledonian Ball in 1946)

‘It’s the most exclusive ball in the world because you cannot go there unless you are staff or, of course, a member of the royal family,’ one estate worker said yesterday.

‘You might even find yourself dancing with the Queen.

‘It’s quite a big ceilidh, with pipers and plenty of music, and is usually held this Thursday.’

Royal sources confirmed to the Mail that the dance had indeed been moved because of the vote.

‘It’s the biggest event during the Queen’s summer stay at Balmoral each year and has been in the diary for some considerable time,’ said one.

‘When it became clear that that it would clash with the date of the referendum, it was put back a day until Friday so that that staff and those involved with the estate could vote.’

Although Royal Deeside is considered to be very much a pro-Union area, several ‘Yes’ posters have been spotted outside homes and shops in the vicinity of the castle in recent days.

While Buckingham Palace has insisted the monarch is remaining determinedly neutral over the issue, her remark to a well-wisher outside church on Sunday urging people to ‘think very carefully about the referendum this week’ has been seized on by the No campaign.

Many campaigners have interpreted her words as clear support for keeping Scotland in the UK.

Last week aides released a statement saying that any suggestion the Queen would want to influence the referendum result is ‘categorically wrong’ and she would continually to remain politically neutral as she is required to constitutionally.

‘Her Majesty is simply of the view that this is a matter for the people of Scotland,’ Buckingham Palace said.
