A couple who were allegedly dragged out of a toilet cubicle of a pub and pepper sprayed after refusing to stop having sex have appeared in court.

Lee Hopps, 30 and Hayley McClory, 23, appeared at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates Court charged with resisting arrest and a public order offence at Stanley Jefferson public house in Bishop Auckland.

Both denied the charges, which followed an incident in which they were reportedly dragged naked from the cubicle of the Wetherspoons pub in front of fellow drinkers, at about 8.30pm on January 28.

McClory also denied a further charge of assaulting a police officer but pleaded guilty to the criminal damage of a police custody blanket when she was detained.

Blair Martin, prosecuting, told the court: 'A barman at the Wetherspoons was aware of some activity in the female toilets in the upstairs part of the bar.

'He goes upstairs to hear noises coming from one of the cubicles.

'Police attended because they would not come out and police had to force entry into the cubicle.

The couple waved to photographers as they left the building and are due back in court on June 10 

'The male defendant was sprayed and offensive language was used.'

Andrew Clinton, representing both defendants, said that the couple accepted they were the ones in the cubicle on the date in question.

The couple, both of Bishop Auckland, deny the public order offence of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause fear or unlawful violence.

Both were bailed to return to court on June 10.
