An Oregon couple were arrested Tuesday after a year during which they allegedly stalked and threatened mountain bike riders and their unleashed dogs on a Portland area hiking trail.

Victims say that David Gathwright, 60, and his wife Pamela Gathwright, 57, would angrily confront them and their dogs on the Sandy Ridge trail while brandishing mace and stun guns.

One mountain biker said Mr. Gathwright even threatened to shoot him with a handgun.

Must hate dogs: Victims say that David Gathwright, 60, and his wife Pamela Gathwright, 57, would angrily confront them and their dogs on the Sandy Ridge trail while brandishing mace and stun guns

Their arrest comes after a year of reports cropping up about their bizarre antics.

Authorities told KOIN in May that the investigation was taking so long in part because many victims took their stories to social media rather than to police.

But if those posts are any indication, many people had dangerous and downright weird encounters with the Gathwrights over the last year.

'Last night the crazy gun toting, bear mace your dog couple struck again to my friend m*****,' wrote Brian F. on the Sandy Ridge Trailhead Mountain bikers Facebook page.

Brian wrote that the couple maced his friend's dog and that the man had pulled his gun on two people he knows. 'They don't like dogs or bikers and hike the trails,' he wrote.

While some say the couple was motivated by an intense fear of dogs, others say they were also angered by mountain bikers in general on the trail.

Chris Hess encountered the Gathwrights along with his wife Angela, their daughters and dogs.

The alleged encounters occurred at the Portland area's Sandy Ridge trail, which is made for mountain biking. Dogs are required to be on a leash on the trail

'The lady leaned down with something in her hand and the dogs were interested, but it was a stun gun and she was sparking it, trying to shock them,' Angela told KOIN about a March 2013 encounter.Things escalated after their daughter tried defending the dogs.

'We didnâ€™t see the gun until it came out,' Angela said. 'The guy drew down right on Chris, right in his face.'

Chris remembered the moment well.

'I remember staring down the barrel of the gun,' he said.

After the Clackamas authorities spent a year or longer tracking down victims and thanks to some victims who followed the couple after an encounter to get their address for police, the Gathwrights have been charged.

Charges against Mr. Gathwright include unlawful use of a weapon, menacing and pointing a firearm at another. His bail was set at $50,000.

Mrs. Gathwright is charged with attempted harassment and attempted animal abuse, with bail set at $25,000.
