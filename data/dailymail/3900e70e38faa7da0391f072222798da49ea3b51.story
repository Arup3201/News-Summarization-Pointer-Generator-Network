LeBron James plans to wear a controversial 'I Can't Breathe' shirt before a match Prince William and Princess Kate are scheduled to attend.

It refers to Eric Garner who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold when he was being arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.

Derrick Rose warmed up in a similar shirt on Saturday before Chicago played Golden State.

A recording of the arrest showed Eric Garner gasping, 'I can't breathe' during the fatal encounter, in July.

Thousands have protested a grand jury decision not to indict the officer since the announcement on Wednesday.

'It was spectacular,' James said of the shirt. 'I loved it. I'm looking for one.'

When asked if he would wear one ahead of the game against Toronto Raptors he said: 'It's posible'.

Asked if he would wear one Monday when Cleveland visited the Brooklyn Nets, James said: 'It's possible.'

'It's a huge honour (to play in front of William and Kate),' James said at the Cavaliers' practice. 'The stuff you read about, people like them only in books growing up, and to hear that they're coming in town to see me play and they want to see me do what I do best, it's a huge honour.'
