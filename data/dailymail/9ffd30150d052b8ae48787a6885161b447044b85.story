A two-year-old boy is fighting for his life after spending a bleak night nearly naked outdoors in southern Poland.

Janusz Skalski, a doctor at the children's hospital in Krakow, said the boy's temperature was 12C and his heart was beating only once every few dozen seconds when he was brought in on Sunday.

Medics have managed to raise child's temperature to 36C - nearly normal - and a regular hearbeat has been restored, said Dr Skalski.

However, the boy, named only as Adam, is still in a medically induced coma and the condition of his brain remains to be seen.

He is still attached to a respirator, but his kidneys, liver, intestines and lungs are said to be working properly.

Police officer Michal Godyn found Adam on Sunday face down in a pile of leaves beneath a tree next to a creek in the village of Raclawice, north-east of Krakow, after he was reported missing.

The temperature had fallen to minus-7C overnight. He was wearing just socks and a pyjama top.

'I cleared the leaves off his face and carried him in my arms to the nearest house,' where an ambulance was called, Officer Godyn told the Fakt daily.

Adam and two other children had been spending Saturday night under his grandmother's care. The woman said she did not see him leave, but the house was not locked, according to Officer Godyn.

Adam was found a few hundred yards from her house, in the direction of his home, Officer Godyn said.

Medics at the children's hospital in Krakow, Poland, have managed to raise child's temperature to 36C - nearly normal - and a regular hearbeat has been restored. The boy nearly froze to death overnight

Doctors began discontinuing anaesthesia to slowly bring Adam out of medically induced coma today.

They are waiting for the slightest movement of a finger or hand to give them a signal that his nervous system is still functioning.

Polish media report that if Adam survives his ordeal it will be a world first. So far the lowest body temperature of anybody saved from hypothermia is 13.7C, Dr Skalski was quoted as saying.

However, Dr Skalski insisted the boy's recovery remains in doubt. 'It would be an absolute miracle if the child could be saved with no negative side effects,' he said.
