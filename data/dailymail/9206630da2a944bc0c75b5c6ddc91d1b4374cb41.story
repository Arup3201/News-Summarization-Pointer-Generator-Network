At just 29, Brisbane mother-of-two Yasmin Rajah is faced with the harrowing reality that she will not see her young sons grow up.

'I think to myself all day, what about my boys... what can I do to make sure that they remember me,' she said.

Ms Rajah suffers an extremely rare form of cancer that is likely to kill her, reported Channel 9's A Current Affair. 'I may not be around past Christmas and expected case is a couple of years,' she said.

At just 29, Ms Rajah could have just months to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer  

After going to a doctor believing she had a broken rib in July, tests revealed a cancerous tumour about the size of a grapefruit and squashing her heart.

Diagnosed with stage 3 cancer, mature teratoma with a malignant adenocarcinoma differentiation, it has since spread to her bones and spine, reducing her chance of survival to just five per cent despite the tumour being removed from her right lung through open heart surgery.

The form of cancer is so rare that little research has been done on it.

After learning she had the disease, Ms Rajah said her first concern was her family - partner Ryan Price and their sons Jazz, eight, and five-year-old Josiah.

The couple have been together for eight years and are now planning to marry thanks to the generosity of the community

Ms Rajah said her first concern after being diagnosed with the cancer was her family, including sons Jazz (left) and Josiah (right)

Jazz said he hoped his mum could stay clam, be strong and get rid of the cancer as quick as a 'flash'.

'We did tell the boys that mummy was going to beat cancer and going to live, but things have changed,' Yasmin said.

Her partner Ryan described Ms Rajah's condition as a sinking boat.

'There's a hole in it and no matter how much water you scope out, it's not helping - it just sinks,' he said.

'I love her with cancer, I love her without cancer, I love her with hair, I love her without hair.'

Mr Price said he loves his partner with or without her cancer

While the couple initially told their sons Ms Rajah would beat cancer, her condition has since worsened

The couple met eight years ago in a bar where Ms Rajah performed and Mr Price said as soon as he saw her, he hoped she would talk to him and they are now planning on getting married.

'It means a lot to be a complete family unit,' Ms Rajah said, regardless of whether a marriage certificate is just a piece of paper to some people.

Ms Rajah previously gave her first engagement ring to a minister who lost his home in a flood because she had no money to offer.

In in act of complete kindness, Mr Price contacted Brisbane radio station B105, which is helping the couple get married with businesses and the public donating wedding rings, a wedding dress, venue hire, hair, make-up, catering and a bucks and hens night.

Since the radio broadcast information about Mr Price's letter, businesses and members of the public have donated goods and services for the wedding

Ms Rajah said the wedding plans had been a great distraction form her illness.

Flight Centre has since teamed up with the radio station to create an online fundraiser at Givex.com so the couple can take their sons with them on a trip to Disneyland LA. 

The company has put $3,000 into the fund, which aims to raise $30,000 by the end of the month.

'This is the hardest thing I know I'll ever have to go through in my entire life,' Mr Price said.

'I hope that if things don't go as well as expected, that they (her sons and partner) know that I love them - that's it', Ms Rajah said.
