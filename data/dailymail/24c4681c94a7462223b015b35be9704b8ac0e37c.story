Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true

An FBI agent fatally shot a Chechen man in Orlando, Florida early Wednesday after the man allegedly turned violent as he was preparing to sign a written confession to his involvement in a 2011 triple homicide, according to authorities.

Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot dead at his condo near Universal Studios just after midnight, FBI Special Agent Dave Couvertier confirmed to MailOnline.

Authorities say Todashev, who had ties to Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pulled a knife on the agent, prompting him to fire his weapon in self defense. The agent was taken to a nearby hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.

'The agent, two Massachusetts State Police troopers, and other law enforcement personnel were interviewing an individual in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation when a violent confrontation was initiated by the individual,' the FBI said in a statement. 'During the confrontation, the individual was killed.'

Investigators said Todashev is not suspected of playing a role in the bombings, but that he had implicated himself and Tsarnaev in a gruesome triple slaying in 2011.

No suspects had been arrested in that case, in which three men were found in an apartment in Waltham, Mass. on Sept. 11, 2011 with their throats cut and marijuana covering their bodies.

Confession: Todashev had allegedly admitted to being involved in the 2011 slaying and that he was preparing to sign a written statement based on his confession when he turned violent and was subsequently shot dead earlier this week

Todashev met Tsarnaev while he was living in Boston because they were both involved in mixed martial arts and boxing

Massachusetts investigators had reported earlier this month that they were uncovering 'mounting evidence' that Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, were involved in the slaying. One of the victims, Brendan Mess, was a close friend of Tamerlan's.

Officials told NBC that Todashev had admitted to being involved in the slaying and that he turned violent when authorities pressured him to sign a statement based on his confession. The officials also told NBC that Todashev had some connections with radical Chechen rebels.

The FBI has been investigating Todashev for the last month, questioning him several times regarding his ties to 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by 
police in a shootout following the deadly April 15 marathon bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, has been charged in connection with the bombings 
and is being held at a prison medical center outside Boston.

Khusen Taramov, a friend of Todashev's, confirmed that Todashev and Tsarnaev knew each other. He said they had been in contact via phone or Skype about
 a week before the bombings.

Shortly before the shooting, Todashev 'had a bad feeling. He felt there's going to be a set-up against him,' a friend said

In an interview with Orlando television station WESH, Taramov said that the two met while Todashev was living in Boston because 
they were both involved in mixed martial arts and boxing.

Todashev
 'wasn't like real close friends [with Tsarnaev], but he just happened 
to know him,' Taramov said. 'But he had no idea that they were up to 
something like that, like bombings and everything, you know what I 
mean?'

Taramov says the FBI has been 
following him and Todashev since the bombings. He said that they were 
both being interviewed by agents late Tuesday before Todashev was killed.

He claims his friend is innocent and that he has been targeted by authorities because he is a Muslim.

'He was just a Muslim - that was his 
mistake, I guess,' Taramov, also a Muslim, told WESH. He said his friend
 is not an extremist and that he doesn't believe he owned a gun.

Shortly before the shooting, Todashev 'had a bad feeling. He felt there's going to be a set-up against him,' Taramov said.

Todashev gave him phone numbers for his mother and father late Monday just in case he got 'locked up.'

'We had a feeling that a worse-case scenario, that something like [a shooting] is going to happen,' Taramov told the television station.

Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011

The mother of the Tsarnaev brothers, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, also confirmed that her older son knew Todashev.

In a telephone interview with the New York Times from Dagestan, Tsarnaeva said Todashev moved from Boston to Florida about two years ago. She said she is devastated to learn that he has been killed.

'Now another boy has left this life,' she told the newspaper. 'Why are they killing these children without any trial or investigation?'

Todashev
 was arrested in an unrelated incident on May 4 for aggravated battery 
after he left a man unconscious in the parking lot of a shopping mall.

According to the arrest affidavit, Todashev had gotten into an altercation with a man and his son over parking space.

Todashev told police that the man 
'got into his face' so he pushed him and then the man's son 'got 
involved' and Todashev began fighting him.

'Todashev said he was only fighting to protect his knee because he had surgery in March,' the affidavit states.

A mall security officer arrived on scene to find the son unconscious and lying in a pool of blood on the ground just as Todashev was pulling away in a white Mercedes.

The officer chased down the Mercedes, ordered Todashev out at gunpoint and arrested him.

The son was later treated at a hospital with a split upper lip, several teeth knocked out and head injuries.
