A woman who could face the death penalty for murdering her ex-boyfriend in a jealous rage has asked for the date of her sentencing to be delayed. 

Jodi Arias admitted killing her former lover Travis Alexander in 2008, who was stabbed nearly 30 times, had his throat slit and was shot in the head, but said it was in self-defense. 

Prosecutors said the murder was premeditated, and that Arias killed Alexander because he wanted to end their affair.

She was found guilty last year but jurors could not decide whether she deserved the death penalty, so a retrial to determine her punishment was set for next month.

Jodi Arias was last year found guilty of brutally murdering her former lover Travis Alexander, but the jury could reach a decision on whether she should face the death penalty

At a hearing on Wednesday at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona, Arias, 34, asked for a delay to give her time to interview an expert witness she plans to call to testify and to review evidence.

Speaking softly while seated at a defense table alongside her two lawyers, it was the first time Arias had argued her own motions.

Arias was previously granted permission to represent herself, so long as the two court-appointed attorneys stayed on as advisers.

But yesterday Arias asked judge Sherry Stephens to postpone the penalty phase of her murder trial, saying she would no longer represent herself if one of the defense lawyers quit the case.

Kirk Nurmi, one of the two attorneys representing Arias, filed a motion last week which said that 'a completely fractured relationship between counsel (and client) now exists'.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez objected, saying that the case had dragged on long enough. 

He added that the original ruling allowing Arias to represent herself stated that there would be no delays.

'She agreed to those terms,' Mr Martinez told the judge.

The convicted murderer also wants one of her defense lawyers to be removed, which could further delay the sentencing, which is set for September 8 in Phoenix, Arizona

Arias has tried to fire Mr Nurmi several times, and he has sought to get off the case too.

Arias told the judge that she would no longer serve as her own attorney and would let her other lawyer, Jennifer Willmott, argue the case if Mr Nurmi was allowed to quit.

'As far as I know, he has not done anything' to assist in the defense lately, Arias told the judge.

Arguments were then closed to the media and public, and it was not immediately clear if the judge issued a ruling.

The prosecutor and defense attorneys left court without comment.

A hearing is set for August 22 on Arias's motion to postpone the retrial.

Under Arizona law, Arias's murder conviction stands and prosecutors have the option of putting on a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to secure the death penalty.

If a new jury fails to reach a unanimous decision, the judge will then sentence Arias to spend her life behind bars or to be eligible for release after 25 years.
