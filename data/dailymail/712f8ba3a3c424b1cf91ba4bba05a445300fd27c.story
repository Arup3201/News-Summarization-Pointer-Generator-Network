Nearly 17 years after the show ended, the neurotic New Yorkers of classic sitcom Seinfeld are being used as a teaching tool for med students at a New Jersey hospital.

The tool, 'Psy-feld,' is helping students both identify and discuss psychiatric disorders with episodes of the show as a reference point. 

Third- and fourth-year medical students must watch the 6 p.m. rerun of Seinfeld on TBS ever Monday and Thursday, then talk about what they saw over the next day's rounds.

The training was created by Anthony Tobia, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, in 2009 for what he calls 'Psy-feld'

One of third-year student Marlene Wang's observation's overheard by a NJ.com reporter: And he just couldn’t live with the idea of this person not liking him.'

The training was created by Anthony Tobia, an associate professor of psychiatry at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, in 2009 for what he calls 'Psy-feld.'

'You have a very diverse group of personality traits that are maladaptive on the individual level,' he said. 'When you get these friends together the dynamic is such that it literally creates a plot: Jerry’s obsessive compulsive traits combined with Kramer’s schizoid traits, with Elaine’s inability to forge meaningful relationships and with George being egocentric.'

He says he got the idea after talking with students about the last episodes of their favorite shows, and one mentioned using 'Lost's' characters as teaching tools.

'You cannot possibly pitch this idea to administration at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School without getting buy in from your chairman, and that’s not easy,' he said. 'Which is why most courses will start with what is traditional and allow course directors and teachers to reference film.'

He's gone so far as to create a database for every episode of the show. 

Five of Elaine's boyfriends show how men display core character traits matching delusional disorder - or at least that's what Tobia wrote in a paper on the show. 

Then there are character's like Newman, who are simply 'very sick.'

Tobia is accustomed to using television and films to make his point, screening the movie 'Fargo' for students to live-tweet thoughts on the character's disorders

'Newman’s sense of self, his meaning in life, is to ensure that he frustrates Jerry,' Tobia told NJ.com. 'We actually have talked about Newman in that context and related him to Erik in 'The Phantom of the Opera.' The Phantom, while he starts out as being the tutor to the Prima Donna, actually has his life change and he is bent on revenge and that becomes who he is… and that’s Newman.'

While some students said they had difficulty seeing beyond the comedy of the show, they said that after they were used to the idea they found more helpful than just textbooks in identifying pathology.

Tobia is accustomed to using television and films to make his point, screening the movie 'Fargo' for students to live-tweet thoughts on the character's disorders.

'In order for a surgeon to teach from a movie or TV show, there has to be surgery,' he said. 'In order for an internist to teach from a movie or TV show, there has to be the portrayal of an illness. Well, every movie, every TV show has human behavior, so a psychiatrist should be able to teach.'
