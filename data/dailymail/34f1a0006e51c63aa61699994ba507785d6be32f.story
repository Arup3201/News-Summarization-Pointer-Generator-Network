The privacy of patients’ medical records is being breached by snooping NHS staff an average of six times a day.

Personal details have been posted on social media or even dumped by the side of the road.

In one instance, a manager at a GP surgery went through the files of nearly 2,000 women for his own ‘interests’.

Other staff have been caught looking at the medical records of their friends, family and, in one case, a love rival.

Figures obtained by the campaign group Big Brother Watch show there were 7,255 ‘data breaches’ by NHS staff between 2011 and 2014, an average of 2,418 a year. 

These are when private information about a patient is seen by anyone other than themselves or their doctor or nurse.

The figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests show staff discussed patients by name on Facebook or Twitter on 50 occasions. 

There were a further 103 instances when data had gone missing, including medical files being dumped by the side of the road or left on a train.

Despite the seriousness of some of the breaches, only 61 staff were dismissed over the three years. There are no figures for the numbers who ended up in court.

The figures highlight extraordinary lapses by staff ahead of the controversial Care. Data project to harvest confidential information from patients’ medical files.

NHS officials are about to begin a pilot project across 265 GP surgeries which involves uploading information from patients medical file onto a computer database.

Eventually it will be rolled out across the country and unless patients object in writing or in person, their data will be automatically harvested.

NHS officials say the Care.Data scheme will unlock a wealth of information that will help expose poor care – such as long waiting times – and may even unlock new treatments.

But campaigners say the data will be shared too easily with private companies such as insurance firms who could use it to hike up premiums.

Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The information held in medical records is of huge personal significance and for details to be wrongly disclosed, maliciously accessed or lost is completely unacceptable.

‘With an increasing number of people having access to patients’ information, the threat of data breaches will only get worse.

‘Urgent action is therefore needed to ensure that medical records are kept safe and the worst data breaches are taken seriously.

‘If the Government wants to introduce new schemes which will make the public’s data more accessible, then this must go hand in hand with greater penalties for those who abuse that access.

‘This should include the threat of jail time and a criminal record.’ 

Yesterday ministers announced they had appointed the first national data guardian tasked with ensuring patients’ privacy is not breached.

Dame Fiona Caldicott will oversee how patients data is used and intervene if there is any cause for concern.

She has previously written two reports about the benefits of using potentially valuable information whilst maintaining patients trust.

The Government was forced to delay the Care.Data scheme in February following mounting concerns by doctors that patients had been left in the dark.

It is now being cautiously re-introduced while officials try and make patients aware of what will happen with their records and how to opt out.

And yesterday ministers promised to give patients better access to their own records enabling them to view test results and order repeat prescriptions on smart phones and laptops.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged that by 2018, patients will see their entire medical history at the click of a computer button.

Eventually ministers hope that patients will be able to download test results and scans without having to book appointments at surgeries or hospitals.

Phil Booth, of the campaign group Med Confidential said: ‘The Care.Data debacle has shown the serious consequences when proper governance is ignored, or only bolted on once things have already collapsed.

‘Meaningful sanctions would show these toxic breaches are being taken seriously, but to rebuild trust requires that every patient knows where their information has gone, and why.'
