A Maryland politician who threatened to sue his local newspaper if they used his name without authorisation has been mercilessly lampooned on Twitter. 

Kirby Delauter of Frederick County, Maryland, threatened to sue the Frederick News-Post after he was named in a story.  

Among those attacking Kirby Delauter is North Korean despot Kim Jong-un's official news agency, who tweeted: 'U.S. Senator Kirby Delauter of Maryland condemned for restricting press freedom, as DPRK press freedom is lauded by international reporters.'

Soon after Councilman Kirby Delauter issued his threat of legal proceedings, Twitter responded immediately

However, the newspaper struck back almost immediately, publishing an editorial which name checked Kirby Delauter 30 times as well as mentioning the hashtag #kirbydelauter, which is being used to mock him on the internet. 

Also within the editorial, which runs to almost 1,000 words, the newspaper ponders whether they should 'use hyphens as in the case of expletives' or possibly refer to him as Councilman [unauthorized]. 

However, the editorial is also an acrostic puzzle, with the first letter of each of the 13 paragraphs spelling out Kirby Delauter's name. 

Many of the online commentators have questioned how the Republican politician will be able to sue a newspaper for using his name without permission, given that free speech is guaranteed under the first amendment of the U.S. constitution.  

Delauter was elected to the council in Frederick County which is approximately 50 miles away from both Washington DC and Baltimore in rural Maryland. 

As well as being attacked on Twitter, dozens of people have commented on his Facebook page where Councilman Delauter pledges to 'govern like a taxpayer'. 

One commenter, Dan Sheckler asked: 'Will you grant permission for the butterknife to be renamed the Kirby Delauter? You know, since it's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.'

But on social media it appeared that Councilman Kirby Delauter was receiving very little support 

Some Twitter commentators highlighted the fact that Kirby Delauter seemed to be opposed to the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution by seeking to infringe on freedom of speech 

Kirby Delauter told the newspaper: 'Use my name again unauthorized and you'll be paying for an attorney.' 

However, managing editor of the Frederick News-Post Terry Headlee said: 'I just don't know how to respond to a request that stupid.' 

Mr Headlee said it's the newspaper's job to hold elected officials accountable by name for their words and deeds.

Knowing Councilman Kirby Delauter as we do, we weren't surprised that he threatened The Frederick News-Post with a lawsuit because we had, he says — and we're not making this up — been putting Kirby Delauter's name in the paper without Kirby Delauter’s authorization. Attorneys would be called, Kirby Delauter said.

In fact, we spent quite some time laughing about it. Kirby Delauter, an elected official; Kirby Delauter, a public figure? Surely, Kirby Delauter can't be serious? Kirby Delauter’s making a joke, right? 

Reasonable men (and women) are required to move Frederick County forward. All Kirby Delauter is doing yet again is displaying his inability to control his temper, embarrassing himself, his district, the county and those who voted him into office. If he wants to govern like a taxpayer, he needs to respect the taxpayers whose money provides his paycheck, stop this silly, inflammatory nonsense, and get to work.

He added: 'If he doesn't want to be held accountable, he needs to seriously consider whether he's cut out to serve the public.'

The Frederick News-Post has a daily circulation of 33,000, although as a result of Kirby Delauter's reaction to the original story, the scandal has now been seen by a global audience, far outside Frederick County. 

The newspaper headlined its Sunday editorial, which it published online in advance, 'Kirby Delauter, Kirby Delauter, Kirby Delauter'. 

Entering the name 'Kirby Delauter' into the search engine Google returns 128,000 results in 0.24 seconds. 

When approached by the Associated Press for comment, Kirby Delauter declined to respond to telephone and email messages. 

Also, during last night's meeting of Frederick Council Council, the politician did not address his current notoriety.  

Councilman Delauter had objected to a recent story by Rodgers that said Delauter shared another councilman's concern about a shortage of reserved parking spaces for council members at the county office building. 

Delauter wrote in his Facebook post that he had refused to be interviewed for the story because Ms Rodgers had misrepresented his comments in the past.

This isn't the first time Delauter's quick temper and belligerent style have brought him unflattering attention during his four years as a county official. 

He stormed out of a board meeting in 2012 after telling a county staff member, 'I'm not going to sit here and be talked to like some punk because I'm asking questions.'

Ms Rodgers reported last year that Councilman Delauter called another board member a 'moron' for disagreeing with him on an issue.  

Washington Post blogger Eugene Volokh, who teaches free speech law at the University of California in Los Angeles, wrote online Tuesday: 'In our country, newspapers are actually allowed to write about elected officials (and others) without their permission.'
