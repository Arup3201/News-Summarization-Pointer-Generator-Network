Alexis Sanchez and his Arsenal team-mates went on a gentle stroll around the grounds of their team hotel ahead of their FA Cup clash against Brighton.

The Chile international uploaded a video of himself and the rest of Arsenal's first team squad walking around the South Lodge Country House hotel in Horsham, West Sussex.

'Come on Gunners, important game today,' accompanied Sanchez's behind-the-scenes footage.

Arsene Wenger's side will make the 19-mile trip from Lower Beeding to Brighton's Amex Stadium in Falmer from the five-star hotel.

Arsenal will be hoping they can avoid an upset by booking a place in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

Sanchez, who has netted 18 goals in 31 games since joining the club from Barcelona, scored in Arsenal's third round win against Hull at the start of January.

The current FA Cup holders received a boost in their quest to retain their trophy as rivals Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham crashed out of the competition on Saturday.
