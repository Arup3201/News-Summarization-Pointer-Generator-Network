A law firm has been slammed for issuing a controversial advertisement that targets  young drug users and offers them legal services.

The sponsored Facebook advertisement from Sydney based firm LY Lawyers, shows a person cutting lines of white powder and reads: 'Busted with possession or supply of drugs at Field Day? Call Sydney's best drug lawyers!'.

Field Day, a popular music festival that runs on New Year's Day each year, saw a record 214 people arrested for drug offences this year, with ecstasy, cocaine, ice, LSD and cannabis all seized by police.

Using Facebook's sponsored advertisement option, the law firm's commercial would have been shown to a specifically targeted audience, most likely young adults who have 'liked' various festivals and music artists on the social media platform.

Since releasing the ad, LY lawyers has been bombarded by critics who claim the firm is playing down the consequences of drug use and normalising the consumption of narcotics.

The firm's principle, Adam Ly, told Daily Mail Australia that he has received a message from one member of the public who called him a 'f***ing filthy dog' for rolling out the ad.

'We get plenty of bad feedback all the time, it's just part of the job,' Mr Ly said. 

He insisted that the commercial did not promote the use of drugs, but rather, presented a means of contact with lawyers who could provide affordable assistance to first time offenders. 

Principle of LY Lawyers, Adam Ly, insisted that the firm's intention was not to 'take advantage of drug users', but to offer support for young first offenders 

'A lot of these kids don't know where to find a lawyer, end up representing themselves and end up with a tarnished record. They are often good people: university students or young professionals who are just experimenting with drugs,' he said of the clientèle his ad targeted 

'We're very progressive and controversial, but were not unethical or trawling and taking advantage of drug users,' Mr Ly said.

'We are not in the business of promoting drug use– we're in the business of helping those who have been charged with drug offences, and that includes people who go to festivals, and helping them find good legal affordable representation – it's just advertising.

'A lot of these kids don't know where to find a lawyer, end up representing themselves and end up with a tarnished record. They are often good people: university students or young professionals who are just experimenting with drugs.

'They're not the hardened criminals that society abhors they're just kids – they're just generally first offenders 18-23 years old, so if the impression people get is that it's not admirable way of advertising your service – that doesn't have much weight.'

'They deserve to be presented with the best legal representation possible at an affordable price, don't you think?' 

Despite this, the firm has been slammed by critics who claim they are encouraging the use of drugs

Mr Ly added that a company with the purpose of working alongside criminals, was unlikely to find a way to effectively advertise their services in an uncontroversial manner.

'We're criminal lawyers – were not exactly the most loved profession in the world. We represent people who have been charged with criminal offences,' he said.

'Any criminal lawyer who advertises is not going to have too many fans just by the very nature of the advertisement and the job we do.'

The firm commends itself for utilising social media as a means to connect with clients: an unconventional tactic in the world of legal advice.

Their Facebook page is filled with memes and links to news articles that relate to criminal convictions, including an image of a cross-eyed puppy which reads: 'I was at the airport; I sniffed a suitcase, that's the last thing I remember'.

'We've been on Facebook for some time so we can connect with clients and we thought it would be a good way to connect with younger generations and first offenders who don't know where to find a lawyer,' Mr Ly said.
