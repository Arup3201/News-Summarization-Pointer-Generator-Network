A Washington woman who was hailed a hero after saving her young son from their burning home and who lost her infant daughter just one day later has been arrested for setting the fire herself.

Melinda 'Mindie' Sayers, 37, was initially called a 'hero' by firefighters for pulling herself and her two-year-old son to safety out of a bedroom window as a fire ravaged her Puyallup home.

Now, the married mother is being held by the Pierce County Sheriff's Department on suspicion of torching her own home on April 1.

Praised: Melinda Sayers said she rescued her young son from a fire that ravaged her house on April 1

Deliberate fire: It was initially thought that the fire was accidentally sparked by a leak in these oxygen tanks, but investigators say Sayers has admitted lighting it herself

Sayers told authorities that she and her son were at home when 'thick, black smoke' suddenly came billowing into the bedroom.

She said she opened the bedroom window, kicked out the screen, threw her son out the window and then jumped out after him. “About two to three seconds later, there was a huge explosion,' Sayers said.

Sayers' 11-month-old daughter, Abigail, was born prematurely and spent most of her young life at Seattle Children's Hospital.

After five brain surgeries, the little girl was considered healthy enough to return home earlier this month.

Sayers said a leaking oxygen tank that had been set up in preparation for Abigail's return home caused the fire.

Desperation: Police say Sayers told them she was unprepared for her brain-damaged baby girl to come home and wanted her to remain in hospital

Community help: The family's plight was taken up by well-wishers, who donated more than $32,000 to help them after the fire and premature death of baby Abigail

'Now we have nowhere to live. We have nothing for her (Abigail when she is released from hospital). You know, it's really hard,' Sayers told Q13 Fox.

Baby Abigail died in hospital the following day.

The story was widely reported and many in the community who heard about the family's plight felt compelled to help them.

A charity fund was established that raised more than $32,000 for the family.

Detective Ed Troyer says officers investigating the case 'noticed that the fire was not consistent with the evidence at the scene to be an accident.'

Detectives questioned Sayers on Thursday, and she reportedly confessed to the arson. 

Explosion: Sayers threw her son and herself out this window before a 'huge explosion' rocked the house and ruined most of the family's belongings

Fraudulent behavior: Investigators discovered that Sayers was a nurse with knowledge of oxygen tanks who was charged with unprofessional conduct in 2013 for filling prescriptions for herself

'The reason that she gives is that she was busy, did not have time, or the desire, to take care of the kid,' Troyer said.

'When you eliminate the place where your child is going to go, you eliminate the problem.'

Troyer says that several other red flags were raised during the investigation, including that Sayer is a Registered Nurse with experience with medical equipment such as oxygen tanks, and that she has a past fraud on her record.

Sayers was charged in 2013 with unprofessional conduct by the nursing commission for falsifying patient records and filling prescriptions for herself.

Her husband, Chris Sayers, had no involvement with the fire, say investigators.

She's expected to make an initial court appearance Friday.
