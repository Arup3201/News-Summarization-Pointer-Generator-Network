Didier Drogba showed he's also the King of the court as Chelsea's players enjoyed a spot of basketball during training on Thursday.

Drogba, who has scored three goals in his last three games for the Blues, looked a natural with the ball in his hands as he joined his team-mates for the lighthearted session ahead of their clash with Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.

Unfortunately for some, the fun session was only for those players who had taken part in Chelsea's 2-1 Capital One Cup win against Shrewsbury Town on Tuesday night as the likes of Diego Costa were put through their paces elsewhere.

Chelsea sit top of the Premier League after an unbeaten start to the season, and have a six-point advantage over reigning champions Manchester City.

Although he didn't take part in the small-sided basketball game, Costa looked in good condition as he trained with the rest of the squad.

Costa's last Chelsea game saw him seal a 2-0 win against Arsenal, and the former Atletico Madrid striker will be hungry to add to his nine-goal tally so far.

Mourinho, who revealed on Tuesday that Costa is ready to return, recently hinted that he believes Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is the man to blame for the centre forward's recent injury troubles.

The 26-year-old began the season in prolific fashion but he has missed Chelsea's last three fixtures because of a persistent hamstring injury.

The former Atletico Madrid man had also been suffering from a cold in the build-up to last Sunday's match against Manchester United, but Mourinho revealed it was injury, rather than illness that ruled the £32million signing out of the match at Old Trafford.

Costa has been troubled by the hamstring problem for some time, but Mourinho believes it was exacerbated by Spain coach Del Bosque fielding the player for back-to-back games against Slovakia and Luxembourg at the start of October.

'The virus is fine,' the Chelsea manager said.

'It was hard, he had to go to the hospital and obviously it doesn't help him to recover from his injury. But he didn't play on Sunday because of the injury, not because of the virus.

'Diego has the hamstring (problem) because he played two matches in three days when he was not with us.'
