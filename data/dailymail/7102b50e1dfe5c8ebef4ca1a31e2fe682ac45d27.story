The long-lost remains of a 16-year-old boy who vanished 41 years ago during a camping trip with his orphanage have been identified thanks to DNA testing in connection to serial killer John Wayne Gacy.

Skeletal remains found in New Jersey's Bass River State Forest in 2000 have been identified as Steven Soden who was last seen running from the park with another boy in 1972, authorities announced on Tuesday.

Soden's family feared that he, as well as 12-year-old Donald Caldwell who has yet to be found, may have runaway from their group that April before being murdered by Gacy.

Gacy was responsible for the deaths of at least 22 teenaged boys and young men in Chicago from 1972 to 1978, the city where Soden's father lived and his family feared he may have traveled to.

In 2011, DNA belonging to Soden's sister was compared to eight of Gacy's unidentified victims at the request of the Cook County Sheriff's Office.

The testing revealed that Soden wasn't 
one of Gacyâ€™s victims but it did match the unidentified remains found near the New Jersey camp 
grounds 13 years ago, thanks to their upload into a DNA database.

Soden's cause of death is currently unknown.

Vanished: Soden and 12-year-old Donald Caldwell were last seen in these New Jersey woods in 1972 with Soden's family fearing he met his end in serial killer John Wayne Gacy

Soden's discovery has re-launched the search for Caldwell by both the New Jersey State Police and National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Gacy was executed for his crimes in 1994.

Anyone with information about the children, the trip or the group is asked to call 1-800-THE-LOST.
