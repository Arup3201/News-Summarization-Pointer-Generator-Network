Stalking: Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Matthew Ghent, 32, admitted harassing his ex-lover relentlessly

Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Matthew Ghent relentlessly harassed his ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him, booking a holiday for them both and even turning up at her office, a court heard.

Ex-England youth international Ghent was branded a 'true stalker' by a judge after he admitted harassing the probation officer, with whom he had a six-month relationship after meeting her on a dating website.

Ghent, who now sells hair and beauty 
products online, played for Villa and England as a youngster but left 
the club without making a first team appearance. He later turned out for
Barnsley, Lincoln City, Solihull Moors and Tamworth.

The 32-year-old from Tamworth, Staffordshire, bombarded his former lover with 70 emails and text messages in a campaign that drove her to the brink of suicide, Northampton magistrates heard.

Ghent, who has since posted online photographs of himself in a bath full of money, was given a 10-week suspended prison sentence, given a restraining order banning him from contacting his ex-lover, and ordered to pay compensation and costs after admitting harassment last week.

The court heard that on one occasion Ghent, who was previously convicted of attacking another ex-girlfriend, even turned up at the woman’s office and only left when her colleagues threatened to call the police.

In a statement handed to the judge, his 30-year-old victim said she was receiving counselling and had even considered suicide after she was harassed by Ghent last July.

Passing sentence, Deputy District Judge Elizabeth Harte said: 'This was an exceptionally unpleasant case of true stalking behaviour.

'This is exactly the kind of behaviour that this law was designed to combat.

'I have been made aware of the very profound effect that this behaviour has had on the victim’s life. This is not the first time you have been convicted of an offence like this and you have a previous record that shows you have engaged in this type of behaviour before.

'I must pass a prison sentence but can provide greater, long-term protection to those that need it by suspending the sentence.

'If you fail to moderate your behaviour, you will go to prison for a long time.'

Julia Barnett, prosecuting, told the court that Ghent had been 'very controlling' during the couple’s turbulent relationship.

They broke up last May and Ghent was given a harassment warning by police after a complaint by the victim.

But
the court heard he then booked a holiday for the couple, without her 
knowledge, last July and tried to convince her to go with him. He 
mounted the campaign of harassment when she refused.

Between July 10 and 25, the court 
heard Ghent sent dozens of emails and texts and also deposited money 
into her online Paypal account.

He turned up at a Probation Service office where she worked on July 18.

Mark
Moore, defending, said Ghent’s behaviour had not been threatening and 
he had suffered difficulties since the end of his football career.

Mr Moore said: 'He accepts he sent a number of emails and messages but they were not threatening in nature.

'He
has suffered from difficulties since his career ended, but he has 
always participated fully in courses ordered by the courts.

'There is now a degree of openness about his behaviour, which is perhaps more difficult to admit in the macho world he is from.'

Mr Moore asked for a suspended jail sentence to be imposed to ensure Ghent was punished but that there was 'appropriate monitoring and support in respect of him and the people he has relationships with in the future'.

Ghent was also ordered to pay the victim £750 compensation and £135 costs.

Judge Harte added: 'No amount of money would really truly reflect what has happened in this lady’s life.

'The most important part of the sentence is the indefinite restraining order.

'If you try to contact her in any way possible you will breach the terms of the suspended sentence and will be sent to prison.'

Ghent’s
latest victim told the court her life had 'changed beyond recognition' 
since they met and she now planned to quit her job and move abroad.

In a moving witness statement, the woman said: 'I have gone from being a safe, independent and confident woman to someone who is constantly looking over their shoulder.

'I have never felt so trapped and isolated while in the relationship. Everything I did and said was in an effort to placate Matthew and to avoid situations of confrontation and aggression. I was constantly treading on egg shells, left feeling confused, in fear for myself, my friends, my family and my pets.

'I was downtrodden and broken, lacking confidence and spark and I always seemed vacant and distracted.'

Her statement added that she was receiving counselling, had considered suicide and had been prescribed anxiety drugs.

And the document said her ordeal had also impacted on her job as a probation officer.

She added: 'My employers had to implement an employee safety plan, which involved the entire centre being alerted to the potential risks of the situation, at huge embarrassment to myself. It has affected the way I work with particular cases.

'I also find it particularly difficult when I am in the courts as part of my job. I am still exploring the idea of moving and working abroad, to escape and have a fresh start.'
