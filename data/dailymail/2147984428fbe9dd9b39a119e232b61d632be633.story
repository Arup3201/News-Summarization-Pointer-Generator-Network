As Britons braved sub-zero temperatures yesterday, Zara Phillips was sunning herself Down Under – on the same day she admitted that being Royal has its perks.

The Queen’s eldest granddaughter teamed a patterned dress with an eye-catching beige fascinator at the Magic Millions horseracing event on Australia’s Gold Coast, where temperatures reached a blistering 35 C.

Zara, 31, who is ambassador of the event’s Racing Women initiative, beamed as she presented the Fashion On The Field award to an elegant female racegoer. 

Hats off to you! The Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips kept cool in a loose dress and beige fascinator at the Magic Millions racing carnival at the Gold Coast Turf Club

Keeping comfortable: Zara recommended that ladies simply wear a great hat and comfy shoes to the races

Perks of the job: Zara Phillips admitted that being a Royal helps her sponsor as her name is more recognisable

Her appearance came as she admitted that her own equestrian career has been boosted by her status.

She told an Australian newspaper: ‘It is better for my sponsors that I am a Royal because my name is more noticed than anyone else’s.’

Zara, who won a silver medal in last year’s Olympic Games, added: ‘My best tip for ladies going to races would just be to wear a great hat and some comfy shoes.’

However, she didn’t appear to have followed her own advice for yesterday’s event, and was pictured in towering heels.

Style queen: Amongst the many tasks Zara had to do, judging a fashion line up was one of them

Head and shoulders: The royal was the ambassador for the event and she had plenty of duties to perform

Thanks for coming: Zara made a final speech before heading off to enjoy the rest of her day

And they're off: From left organisers Katie Page-Harvey, Michelle Lang-McMahon, Gerry Harvey and Zara pose for a final photograph
