In hiding: Salman Rushdie, pictured here just days before The Satanic Verses was released in February 1989, was forced to live in protective custody for fear that extremists would assassinate him

Salman Rushdie has revealed the scariest hour of his life when he thought that his ex-wife and young son had been killed because of his work.

In preparation for the release of his new book detailing his months spent in hiding in 1989, British Indian novelist Rushdie wrote an article for The New Yorker telling how he feared that he would have to sacrifice himself in order to save his son.

The journey begins after the release of his book The Satanic Verses in February 1989, when Rushdie went into protective custody after Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini went on the national radio and issued a fatwa, or religious order for Muslims, condoning his assassination and offering a bounty for his head.

Though the threat started in Iran - far from Rushie's home in London - it carried great weight as the author's book was considered blasphemous by many Muslims throughout the globe.

The threat was thought to be so credible that the British police deemed it Level 2, meaning he came after the Queen in the pecking order of possible targets.

Shortly after being assigned a constant security detail - which included volunteer officers because the risk attached to the duty of guarding him was so great that the police could not order officers to take on the assignment - Rushdie and his then-wife fled London in hopes of steering clear of angry mobs.

Before doing so, he visited his first wife Clarissa Laurd and their young son Zafar. They made a plan that they would check in every night at 7pm on the dot to make sure that both parties were alright.

Angry protests: On February 14, 1989, the Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini said on the national radio that a religious law- a fatwa- now existed against Rushdie because his book slandered the prophet Muhammed

The plan was to have Rushdie call Laurd's home phone, and if they knew they were not going to be there at the time, they would leave a message on Rushdie's machine in London.

It worked perfectly for months and gave Rushdie the assurance that he needed while hiding out in the countryside.

Fear: The British police deemed the degree of threats against Rushdie as Level 2, second only to the Queen

A month into his life of hiding, Rushdie called as per usual but had no response from Laurd and had no message on his machine.

An hour went by, and Rushdie was in true panic mode. He had his security detail arrange for a London squadron go check on the house to see if it looked like there had been an attack.

His fears were realized when the police reported that all of the lights were on in the home and the front door was open.

Rushdie sat with his face dripping wet with tears as he ran through options where an angry mob had killed his ex-wife during a struggle but held on to his young son in an effort to negotiate a ransom for Rushdie's head.

'You understand, that if they have 
him and they want a ransom, they want me to exchange myself for him, 
then I’m going to do that, and you guys can’t stop me doing it,' Rushdie
told his body man, Stan.

'That
thing about exchanging hostages, that only happens in the movies. In 
real life, I’m sorry to tell you, if this is a hostile intervention they
are both probably dead already. The question you have to ask yourself 
is, Do you want to die as well?' Stan replied.

The
minutes of tense waiting were punctuated only by the sound of Rushdie 
dialling and redialling the home number of his ex-wife.

Then and now: Though the fatwa has never been officially retracted, Rushdie no longer lives in hiding

Finally,
he heard his young son's voice pick up and explain that they had been 
at a school drama event that ran overtime. All was fine but Rushdie's 
calm had not returned as he feared that intruders were hiding inside the
house since police had seen that the door was ajar before Laurd and 
Zafar got home.

'It would seem, that there has been a regrettable error. The car we sent to have a look looked at the wrong house,' Stan said.

The phone schedule and the many other ways in which his life changed following the fatwa are the basis for the author's latest book, entitled Joseph Anton as an homage to his alternate identity used while he was under protection, which is released next week.
