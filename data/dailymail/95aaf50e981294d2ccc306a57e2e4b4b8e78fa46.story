On the beach: Lifeguard Charlotte Leslie in 1999 before she became an MP

From her tousled hair, to her sultry pout and that striking red 
one-piece, this athletic blonde could easily pass for a cast member from
 Baywatch.

But this beach babe - whose trim and toned figure rivals 
that of Baywatch star Pamela Anderson - is now more likely to be seen on 
the backbench than in the lifeguard’s seat.

This is none other than 
Charlotte Leslie, Tory MP for Bristol, who worked as a lifeguard in 
Cornwall in the 90s, before she went on to study classics at Oxford 
University.

The former champion said the picture, which emerged as the MP gave an interview about the importance of exercise, was taken by her mother in 1999 when she was 20.

Miss
 Leslie, 35, was brought into the party with a swathe of other young, 
attractive women who were intended to boost the Tory’s popularity among 
women.

The champion swimmer trained four hours a day as a child and was a hopeful for the British Olympic team.

She
 said: ‘I only became a lifeguard because my swimming never worked out.

'I
 realised I just was not going to make it as a swimmer, that was a real 
shock to the system.

'Most of my friends had gone off to do internships at big law firms and I felt my career had really slipped through the net.

'But although it was a summer job and was not as lucrative and important as my friends, it taught me a huge deal that I am so grateful for.

'The skills I learnt I use now in the world of politics.

'Unfortunately, people think talking is the same thing as doing in politics, when it is definitely not.

'It taught me how to prioritise and manage questions.

'You can’t press release, or statement a live incident, you just have to do it.

'Usually if things go wrong at work you can say "well no one died", but in this case someone could have done.

'I met some of my best friends through the job too. They really taught me an awful lot and inspired me throughout my life.

'I’ve always said to them they have to tell me if I become one of those ‘prat politicians’, and it’s great to be grounded like that.'

Now: Miss Leslie, MP for Bristol North West now. The image emerged as the politician gave an interview about the importance of exercise

A woman's looks are more important than her policies, say US researchers. They found that women with more feminine faces tend to do better at the ballot box.
