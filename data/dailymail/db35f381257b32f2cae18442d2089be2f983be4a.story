Police are close to making an arrest 
in the fatal shooting of the much-loved local radio talk show host who 
was known for her activism on veterans' issues.

The bullet-riddled body of April 
Kauffman was found at her home near Jersey Shore around 11:30 am on 
Thursday by a handyman who called 911, according to Atlantic County 
Prosecutor Ted Housel.

Housel said the 47-year-old had been 
shot numerous times in the bedroom of her home in Linwood, about 12 
miles from Atlantic City.

Murdered: April Kauffman had been shot numerous times in the bedroom of her home in Linwood, about 12 miles from Atlantic City

The day before her death, she 
co-hosted 'The King Arthur Show' on radio station WIBG, a show she had 
appeared on weekly for at least several months. But the prosecutor said 
the killing apparently had nothing to do with her work on the radio.

Atlantic County Prosecutor Theodore 
Housel suggested Friday that an arrest was likely, though he didn't say 
how soon or provide any information about a possible suspect.

'We have sufficient information to conduct an ongoing investigation that we believe will ultimately be successful,' he said.

Kauffman’s friends and associates said
she owned a catering business and a hair salon but was best known in 
the area for her support of veterans, including on-air.

Her husband, James Kauffman, is a practicing endocrinologist in Linwood, The Press of Atlantic City reported.

Well-known: Kauffman hosted a weekly talk radio program on WOND, where she advocated for veterans causes and other issues

Neighbours told CBS that they 
witnessed Kauffman's distressed husband arriving at 
the murder scene yesterday, saying his wife was asleep with a pillow over her face when he went to 
work early that morning.

Neighbour Lou Tate told ABC that the endocrinologist spoke briefly to his wife and kept asking, 'Why now?'

'I
think he's getting ready to retire,' Tate told the station. 'They 
bought a home in Arizona, and I think they wanted to relocate possibly.'

Kauffman, a grandmother, hosted a weekly talk radio program on WOND, where she advocated for veterans causes and other issues.

'She just had an incredible 
personality. She could never say no to any charity or anything. The kind
of person who would give you the shirt off her back,' her radio show 
co-host, Arthur Gropper, said.

Gropper said Kauffman was in a jovial 
mood Wednesday, with no indication anything was troubling her. He said 
they were celebrating progress on veterans issues and she was talking 
about wanting to work with homeless veterans.

Until February, she had also hosted a weekly talk show on radio station WOND.

Donna Clementoni, a friend and fellow 
veterans advocate from Egg Harbor Township, told The Press that Kauffman
sent her an email around 1:50 a.m. Thursday about an event the two were
planning. She said she tried to reach Kauffman about 9 a.m. but 
couldn't.

'I have no idea why anyone would do 
this. She's like a local legend. She's outspoken. She's like a bombshell
and all she ever wanted to do was help people,' Clementoni said.

Tribute: Harry Hurley, who did several radio broadcasts with Kauffman, said the 47-year-old 'Did the work of 100 people'

Harry Hurley, who did several radio broadcasts with Kauffman, told The Press of Atlantic City that she ‘did the work of 100 people.’

He was shocked that somebody who did so much to help other people could be murdered so viciously.

'I can't think of anybody that would 
want to do harm to April because all she ever did was help people and 
she didn't do it in a way that she could have garnered any enemies,' Hurley told CBS.

US Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) added to the network: 'Quite simply,
April was a patriot in every sense of the word and her tireless work on
behalf of those who served made a real difference in the lives of 
many.'

The tireless activist had recently been 
awarded the New Jersey Governor's Jefferson Award for her outstanding 
contribution to the community, according to the Press of Atlantic City.

Police tape remained cordoned around the couple's home on Friday as detectives continued to scour the area for clues.

A neighbour who did not want to be identified told the South Jersey News that the Kauffmans kept an arsenal of weapons in a vault in their basement.

Linwood police chief Robert James confirmed to the Press of Atlantic City that the family owned guns, but would not comment on weather any of them were used in the murder.

Tributes have started pouring in for 
Kauffman, who also owned a salon and catering company, and was 
well-known - and loved - in the community.

Leslie Potts wrote on Facebook: 'There
wasn’t too much I liked about living in New Jersey, but when I first 
moved there, not knowing a soul, a lady named April Christine Kauffman 
became one of my very first friends. She took me in and made me feel 
like part of her family.

R.I.P April. I will never forget ALL the wonderful things you’ve done for me.'

Another person named Katie Fleming Frassinelli added: 'It’s because of April’s tireless efforts that we now offer Wounded Warrior events at the National Corvette Museum.

'April
- you will be sorely missed. We know that you are still providing 
comfort to those troops that have been lost and are now in heaven. Know 
that your legacy will continue to live on at the Museum with our Wounded
Warrior program!'

The prosecutor's office and the Linwood Police Department are investigating. No arrests have been made.
