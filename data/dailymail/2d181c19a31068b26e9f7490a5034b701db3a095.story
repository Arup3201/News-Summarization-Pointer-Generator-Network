A female victim of a hammer attack at a four-star hotel has been left with just 5 per cent brain function and lost her left eye, police said today.

The woman remains in a critical condition after she was attacked along with her two sisters in their room at the Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch in London's West End.

Philip Spence, 32, from
Hounslow, west London, was today remanded in custody by District Judge 
Mike Snow after appearing at West London Magistrates' Court accused of 
the attack.

At the man's court hearing, police confirmed the woman's sisters remain in hospital in a less severe condition.

Philip Spence, 32, will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court today. Three others have been charged in relation to the attack, with another bailed pending inquiries

Speaking outside court, a Met Police spokesman said: 'The main victim suffered life threatening 
head and facial injuries, has lost her left eye and significant 
quantities of blood.

'Doctors have assessed that she has 5 per cent brain function, although her other organs are in good working function.'

Another sister suffered two fractures to her skull, a broken left arm and a fracture to her cheekbone.

She is expected to remain in hospital for a considerable time and will have two operations in the coming week.

The third sister has a fracture to her skull and a ruptured left eardrum.

She was released from hospital on April 8 but readmitted on April 9 with severe head pains.

The 
women, from the United Arab Emirates, had come to London for shopping 
and sightseeing and arrived in the UK between April 3 and 5.

They had visited large West End stores last Saturday and were staying near Europe's busiest shopping street, Oxford Street.

Spence was today remanded in custody today. He was charged with three counts of attempted murder and one of aggravated burglary.

Thomas
 Efremi, 56, of Islington, north London, appeared in court charged with 
handling stolen goods and fraud by false representation, while James 
Moss, 33, from Finsbury Park, north London, appeared charged with 
receiving stolen goods.

Both men were also remanded in custody and will appear together with Spence at Southwark Crown Court on April 17.

Carly
 Baker, 31, also from Finsbury Park, is charged with handling stolen 
goods and is expected to appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' 
Court on Tuesday.

All four are British nationals, police have confirmed.

A 34-year-old man has been bailed to return pending further inquiries on a date in May.
