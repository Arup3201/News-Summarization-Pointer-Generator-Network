Amazon has come under fire for listing products for sale that claim they can cure cancer.

The products, available to order from third parties through Amazon's UK website, include dried crocodile's blood pills, apricot kernels and blood cleansers.

Among their listings, they claim to be able to 'relieve' cancer and 'give cancer cells a hard time'.

The 1939 Cancer Act bans adverts that claim to offer cures or treatments for the disease.

The items were only taken down from the site after The Times newspaper contacted the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, two weeks after Amazon was told about the listings.

Pharmacology professor David Colquhoun, of University College London, told the newspaper: 'The real danger is that people will believe the hucksters and take only things like these.'

Orders for one of the products, Indian Madder sold by Ayur Organics and Herbs UK, were fulfilled by Amazon UK itself, meaning the items are posted from one of its own warehouses.

Indian Madder claimed to be a 'blood 
cleanser' while Bob's Best Apricot Kernels, sold by Karowi, said it 
gives cancer cells 'a hard time'.

In 2006, the Food Standards Agency warned that apricot kernels  can produce cyanide and could be fatal in high doses over a
short period of time.

Wanithai dried crocodile blood supplement, sold by Sabuy My Shop, claimed to 'relieve' cancer.

Professor Colquhoun called the claims about their medical properties 'absurd'.

When approached by MailOnline this morning, a spokesman for Amazon UK responded with: 'I can confirm that those items are not available for sale.'

He did not comment on why it had taken so long to remove the products from the site.
