The lead oboist of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra collapsed on stage on Saturday night after suffering a brain hemorrhage.

William Bennett, 56, was in the middle of a Richard Strauss' Oboe Concerto when he fell from his chair in front of a packed audience and lay unconscious for 20 minutes before the paramedics arrived.

The musician, who had been treated for tonsil cancer in 2004, collapsed at the Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.

He reportedly held his oboe above his head long enough for a violinist to grab it, according to the SF Gate.

A doctor who was sitting in the front row, jumped on stage to help the musician until paramedics arrived, according to the Arts Journal.

There was a longer than scheduled intermission but the orchestra completed its evening's performance.

Oliver Theil, from the symphony orchestra, told Mercury News: 'We
all think the world of Bill and our thoughts and best wishes are with 
him and his family. We're just all hoping that he's going 
to be well.'

Mr Bennett had previously undergone radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer but was given the all clear and returned to performing a year later.

The classically-trained musician, who is married, joined the San Francisco symphony in 1979 and has been principal since 1987.
