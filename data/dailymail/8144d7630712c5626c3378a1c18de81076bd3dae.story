Three Kenyans tortured by the British colonial authorities during the Mau Mau uprising can pursue their claims for compensation against the Government.

The landmark decision to allow the elderly trio to seek damages more than 50 years after the bloody conflict follows an earlier admission by the Foreign Office that atrocities had been carried out ‘at the hands of the colonial administration’.

The judgment – which was celebrated by Mau Mau veterans in the streets of Nairobi yesterday – opens the door to thousands of claims relating to alleged abuse in Kenya and other former colonies, which could cost Britain millions to resolve.

The High Court yesterday rejected the Government’s claim that too much time had elapsed for there to be a fair trial, with Mr Justice McCombe finding the three Kenyans had ‘arguable cases in law’.

The ruling means the case will now go to a full trial, pending an appeal by the Foreign Office, which said the judgment had ‘potentially significant and far-reaching legal implications’. Alternatively, the Government could opt to settle the claims and pay damages.

According to their legal team, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, 84, Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73, were subjected to ‘appalling abuse’, including castration, beatings and sexual assaults. Yesterday’s ruling, which came after a three-year legal battle, was hailed as ‘historic’ by their lawyers.

The British government has responded by 
expressing its disappointment with the decision, although it stressed 
that it did 'not dispute that each of the claimants in this case 
suffered torture and other ill treatment at the hands of the colonial 
administration.'

After the news broke today that the 
claims could proceed to trial, solicitors Leigh Day & Co said has 
warned the Government could face potentially thousands of claims from 
Kenyans who suffered similar torture.

Senior partner Martyn Day said: 'This is
 a historic judgment which will reverberate around the world and will 
have repercussions for years to come.

'Following this judgment, we can but 
hope that our Government will at last do the honourable thing and sit 
down and resolve these claims.

'There will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture, from Malaya to the Yemen, from Cyprus to Palestine, who will be reading this judgment with great care.'

The government had sought to have the case dismissed, arguing it could not be held legally responsible for the long-ago abuses and a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman has stated it would appeal.

The FCO spokesman said: 'The British Government is disappointed with today's judgment. The judgment was not a finding of liability but a procedural decision following a preliminary hearing on limitation, which allows the cases to go to a full trial.

'The judgment has potentially significant and far-reaching legal implications. The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years.

In this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened.'

Although disappointed with the decision and reiterating the decision to appeal, the spokesman told of the British Government's close relationship with Kenya and its people.

'Since this is an important legal issue, we have taken the decision to appeal. In light of the legal proceedings it would not be appropriate for the Government to comment any further on the detail of the case.

'At the same time, we do not dispute that each of the claimants in this case suffered torture and other ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration.

'We have always said that we understand the pain and grievance felt by those, on all sides, who were involved in the divisive and bloody events of the emergency period in Kenya, and it is right that those who feel they have a case are free to take it to the courts.

'Our relationship with Kenya and its people has moved on since the emergency period. We are now partners and the UK is not only one of the largest bilateral donors in Kenya, but also Kenya's biggest cumulative investor, and a key partner on security and other issues of benefit to both countries. Our people-to-people ties are and will remain strong and deep.'

In his ruling, the judge said there was 'an amply sufficient documentary base' to test what was known in London about excessive use of force in the camps throughout the period of the emergency, and what London's reaction to that knowledge was.

'On the basis of that material, if necessary supplemented by the witness evidence that is likely still to be available - either in statements or orally in court - I am satisfied that a fair trial of any question of breach of duty in respect of each of the surviving claimants is possible.

'Looking at those claimants' evidence, I think that it will be quite possible to determine sufficiently clearly where and when they suffered their injuries and the official status of those responsible for inflicting them.

'It will also be possible, on the documents arranged and collated chronologically, together with the other evidence, to determine whether or not the injuries occurred because of a breach of duty on the part of the United Kingdom government.'

When giving his ruling last year, the judge emphasised that he had not found there was systematic torture in the Kenyan camps nor that, if there was, the UK Government was liable to detainees, such as the claimants, for what happened.
