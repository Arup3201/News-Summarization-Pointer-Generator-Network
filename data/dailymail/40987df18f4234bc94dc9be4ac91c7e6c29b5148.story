A London cocktail bar has outraged 
animal conservationists after it was discovered selling a cocktail 
allegedly flavoured with whale skin.

Whale
is banned from sale in Europe as part of EU protection policies, but it
would appear the Nightjar bar in Hoxton, east London, has been flouting
those rules.

A
cocktail called the Moby Dick is described on the bar's menu as 
containing Laphroaig whiskey, Drambuie, ale and bitters - and a 'whale 
skin infusion'.

Police acted on a tip-off to raid the premises and took away a sample which is to undergo analysis.

A
Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed: 'We received an allegation in 
October 2012 that whale skin was being sold at a premises in City Road, 
Hackney.

'Officers executed a warrant at premises in City Road, Hackney, on Monday, 3 December.

'The
warrant was executed by officers from the Met's Wildlife Crime Unit 
assisted by an officer from the United Kingdom Border Force.

'One item from the premises was seized. This has been sent for analysis.'

The
accusation comes after investigators from the Whale and Dolphin 
Conservation found whale meat on sale at a shop in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Sales
in the country are allowed only to Greenland Inuits who must show ID to
be served, but the DayCatch Greenland shop sold a whale steak to an 
Irish journalist.

The furore
comes as Greenland, the only European country allowed to sell the meat 
for 'subsistence' purposes, seeks to increase its annual killing quota.

It
failed in its bid at the last meeting of the International Whaling 
Commission after it was discovered supermarkets were selling the meat to
tourists, but says it will kill extra whales anyway, raising fears of a
return to commercial whaling.

Whales used to be hunted in their thousands for oil and meat but commercial whaling was banned in 1986.

Inuit people in Greenland are still allowed to catch a number of the animals annually for subsistence, while other countries to consume the product are Canada, the Faroe Islands and Japan, which wants to end the ban.

The
Whale and Dolphin Conservation told the Sunday Times: 'We have long 
been concerned about the validity of Greenland's subsistence hunting of 
minke and fin whales as well as its annual kill of thousands of dolphins
and porpoises.

'It already 
sells whale meat in Greenland supermarkets and now this has extended to 
mainland Europe, with whale meat on sale to tourists in Copenhagen.'

The owner of DayCatch apologised for selling the product and reported himself to the Danish Government.

He said he sold the meat due to 'misunderstood good-hjeartedness' and added the shop had now stop the imports.

Nightjar
told the paper it had been unaware its cocktail contained any illegal 
ingredient and says it has taken the drink off the menu.
