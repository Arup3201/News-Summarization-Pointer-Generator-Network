It was undoubtedly the wedding of the 
year; whether or not you found it tasteless or a breathtaking evocation 
of fairytale dreams.

Now
new details have emerged that reveal the epic scale of billionaire internet entrepreneur Sean Parker's 
Lord of the Rings themed wedding to Alexandra Lenas, 24, in California's Big 
Sur this June. 

Multimillion dollar extravaganza: Internet billionaire Sean Parker exchanged vows with singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas in Big Sur in June and new pictures and details have been revealed in Vanity Fair

Perhaps
the most corny revelation is that the 33-year-old Napster founder, who 
was portrayed by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network, serenaded his 
bride Alexandra Lenas with the song Part Of Your World from Disney's The
Little Mermaid.

Considered a
sharp shooting Silicon Valley wise guy, mostly because of Timberlake's 
too-cool-for-school performance in the 2010 movie, it will probably 
surprise most people to hear that Parker knew all the words to the 
cartoon classic. 

According
to Vanity Fair's David Fitzpatrick, the happy groom earnestly looked 
into his new wife's eyes as he reeled out lines like: 'Look at this 
trove, treasures untold / How many wonders can one cavern hold?'

Fitzpatrick described the moment as 'endearing, corny, and over-the-top,' but it 
was all part of what Parker described as their 'performance art 
project.'

Vanity Fair reveal many other incredible details, including how there were so many white rose petals on the ground that Parker's ring was temporarily lost when his nervous bride dropped it; her father had to lend his own for the ceremony.

Parker,
who still disputes that the wedding cost $10 million, did concede that 
preparing the Redwoods site alone came to $4.5 million.

He
oversaw the whole shebang, from the tiniest detail to the gargantuan set dressing; and even created a 
leather-bound keepsake volume for all those attending - which tells the 'fairytale' of the
couple’s romance.

Its design was intended - rather incongruously -  to echo the invitation to 
the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, showing how grandiose Parker intended the event to be.

'Performance art': Parker, here with Alexandra while she was expecting daughter Summer, saw the nuptials as an immersive experience

But it was just one of hundreds of opulent and elaborate touches that made June 1st a very special day in this forest near the Pacific Ocean.

Fitzpatrick wrote: 'People literally gasped as [Parker and Lenas] emerged into a 
glade in which planted flowers and hanging garlands conferred a riot of 
color and a sense of undulation.

'The
newlyweds dined on salmon with beets and Napa cabbage (entrée choices: 
porchetta, chicken, or venison) while perched upon a 10-foot 
sofa-throne, their feet nestled in a bearskin rug.'

And
they really did think of everything, as the Vanity Fair writer noted 
that there was: 'A pen of bunnies was nearby for anyone who needed a 
cuddle.'

All 364 guests were dressed in outfits made by Lord of the Rings designer Ngila Dickson so nobody felt left out of Parker's all encompassing theme.

Fantasy line: The setting was beautiful, but Parker had many more of his own touches to add

They included included Trudie Styler and Sting, Twitter creator Jack Dorsey who tried and failed to get Sting 
to sign up to the social networking site, Cory Booker, Allison Williams, Kyle MacLachlan Olivia Munn, Emma Watson, 
Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl.

Sting, 61, even broke into an a cappella version of his song, I Was Brought to my Senses for the tickled bride and groom at one point.

San Francisco designer Ken Fulk was put in charge of the setting’s visual elements, which were none too subtle in scope.

You have to wonder what became of the '20-foot-high gate, with the couple’s initials 
intertwined in wrought iron' that greeted guests before they 'descended onto a path lined with 
imported evergreens.'

'God's cathedral": Set designers had constructed faux bridges, a ruined stone castle, a 10-foot Celtic cross, and two broken Roman columns that straddled the altar, beneath the largest tree in the grove

beneath the largest tree in the grove.'

Last
month, Parker wrote a 10,000-word piece in TechCrunch about how he and
his new wife were on the receiving end of criticism 'normally reserved 
for genocidal dictators'.

Parker wrote in an email to The Atlantic: 'Everything we did was an homage to nature, to the natural redwood environment which I call "God's cathedral".'

Mythical setting: The Big Sur area was ripe for turning into a fantasy land, but Parker paid for it

Parker paints a picture of a young couple, eager to exchange their vows.

'My wife Alexandria and I met five 
years ago, fell in love, and almost immediately began fantasizing about 
our wedding day, which, we both agreed, should take place deep within an
enchanged forest.'

However, Parker goes into colorful 
detail about the backlash he and his wife received the morning after 
they became husband and wife.

'Descriptions of me included the words 'douchebag' and 'pr**k,' of my wife, the words 'gold-digger' and 'whore,' wrote Parker.

'Luckily amongst the rabble were some 
unusually creative hate-mongers who managed to keep our attention by 
dispensing inventive insults like 'douchemonster,' 'jackassery,' 
'jackwagon' and, my personal favorite, 'douche canoe.'

What else but big? The couple's wedding cake was nine feet tall

Parker goes into a tremendous amount of detail explaining how he and his wife-to-be went out of their way to protect the redwood forest that they had decided to marry in.

'We wanted our wedding to begin with 'Once upon a time' and end with' and they lived happily ever after' says Parker.

However, he laments that 'life rarely works out the way it does in fairy tales, as much as we hoped it would.'

This was despite decking out the woods at Big Sure with faux bridges, which Parker wanted to be like 'Lothlorien, the mythical home of Galadriel in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings'.

Raging at the unexpected backlash, Parker says that it must be obvious he never intended any adverse ecological impact on the redwood forest.

In fact, he claims to have gone out of his way to reduce the environmental impact of the large wedding, which was in stark contrast to Facebook founder and one-time colleague Mark Zuckerberg - who married at his home in Palo Alto, California.

'Because we wanted to avoid any harm to the forest, we asked the Save the Redwoods League to send their Director of Science, Emily Burns, down to the site to advise our landscape architect on 'best practices' for working within the forest,' wrote Parker in Techcrunch.

Indeed, Parker points out that 'nobody chooses to get married in a redwood forest unless they love redwood forests.'

Going into deeper levels of detail, Parker explains that the site of his fan-boy wedding was already damaged by 'a century of logging'.

But the wedding also gained extra controversy after Parker has been slapped with a $2.5 million penalty after he failed to get the proper permits for his 'Game of Thrones' style Big Sur marriage ceremony.

The California Coastal Commission and Parker said they have reached a settlement to pay for coastal conservation programs after the Napster co-founder built a large movie-set like wedding site in an ecologically sensitive area of Big Sur.

Officials were tipped off about Parker's lavish $10 million wedding, which saw him build a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dance floor near iconic redwoods and a stream with threatened steelhead trout, when neighbors complained.

The complaints prompted a county investigation into the construction at a closed campground owned by Ventana Inn & Spa.

The Ventana is negotiating a separate settlement for allowing the construction to occur.

The Ventana is located within the coastal zone, an area regulated by the commission, an independent state agency that oversees coastal development.

Any significant construction within the zone has to be permitted.
