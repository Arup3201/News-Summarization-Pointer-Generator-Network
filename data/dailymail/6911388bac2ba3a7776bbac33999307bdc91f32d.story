The mother of a missing 14-month-old boy told police she abandoned him on a porch - then days later led police to his  his viciously beaten body that had been stuffed inside a backpack and dumped in an Ohio river, a court has heard.

When Cameron Beckford was reported missing last Friday by his father, Dainesha Stevens, 24, claimed she left the toddler on a porch because she could no longer care for him.

Five days later, she led police to the youngster's mangled body in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio, authorities say.  

Stevens and her son were staying with  a childhood friend, Kurt Flood, at his home in Columbus, after she fled the home of the boy's father in Maryland two weeks ago.

No one has yet been charged in the boy's death, though Stevens was called in front a judge after she was charged with failing to protect her son from child abuse. 

A court heard that Cameron was horrifically beaten between December 21 and 23 - a week before his body was found.

Missing: Authorities continue to search for 14-month-old Cameron Beckford, who they warn may be already dead

Mother: Dainesha Stevens, pictured during a court appearance on Wednesday, admitted she and a male acquaintance left the boy, Cameron Beckford, on Friday night because they could no longer care for him 

Stevens has now been charged with failing to protect her son 'by allowing an individual to violently spank him numerous times on several occasions.' 

Flood, also 24, is being held in the county jail on an unrelated misdemeanor and a probation violation stemming from a felony weapons charge.  

Stevens made up a story about leaving the boy on a porch and says that was her way of asking for help, said her attorney, Mark Collins. 

During a court appearance on Wednesday, he said: 'There's reasons why she said what she said, but she's trying to do the right thing and that's what she did by helping yesterday and today.'

Collins said Stevens came to the Columbus area December 15 after calling police in Maryland for help, then receiving a bus pass from the local protective services agency.

Frederick police spokesman Lt. Clark Pennington said a domestic dispute preceded Stevens' departure, however there were no details about what happened. 

'I know that they had, like, an argument on the 14th and that's why we think she went to Ohio on the 15th,' he said.

Frederick police previously said the father of Cameron and Steven's six-year-old daughter Cheyene, Shawn Beckford, called police on Sunday and reported that their mother had taken them to an unknown location in Columbus in mid-December.

Collins said he didn't know the details of what happened in Maryland.

Stevens' attorney Mark Collins said during her first court appearance Wednesday that she lied about abandoning her son on a porch as a cry for help 

The father of Stevens' two children, Cameron and Cheyenne, six, reported them missing after she had fled to Columbus, Ohio, mid-December 

Stevens on Monday reported that Cheyenne had been taken to an unknown location by a friend, and investigators determined the toddler was missing while questioning the woman, police said.

'But I haven't seen her since Christmas Eve,' Stevens of Cheyenne in a 911 call obtained by Fox 28. 'And I've been trying to get her back from the people, and they won't tell me any information about her. They won't even try to bring her back to me.' 

Cheyenne later was found at a home on the city's west side and is in good condition, authorities said. She has been turned over to Franklin County Children Services.

Stevens was staying with a male friend she knew as a teenager in Maryland, Collins said. That man is being held on misdemeanor warrants unrelated to the toddler's disappearance.

'It's our goal to keep that man in custody pending further investigation by the police,' said Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien. 

Stevens pointed police to the creek, Collins confirmed Wednesday without providing details. 

The 24-year-old mother led police to Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio, where Cameron's body was found stuffed in a back pack

A court heard on Wednesday that the child's body had been in the water for days 

Police said Stevens had legal custody of both children. 

A missing-child alert said the toddler was wearing a puffy black coat, gray pants, black and red boots and a gray elephant hat. Police said he's black with brown eyes and a Mohawk hairstyle. 

A woman who answered the phone at a house believed to be the father's residence said he wasn't home. She said Beckford was her son. She apologetically declined to answer more questions and would not give her name. She also refused to open the door to the apartment, located in a densely populated neighborhood in the city, about 40 miles west of Baltimore.

Criminal complaints obtained by Fox28 say three days before Christmas Cameron was 'violently spanked repeatedly' in a Columbus home - and his mother did not step in to save him.

The complaints also said the spanking 'caused layers of skin to be removed from the child buttocks.'

Court documents obtained by the station says Cameron's body was moved December 27 with Steven's permission for '[impairing] its availability as evidence.' 

She has been placed on suicide watch while in custody. Police are holding her and Flood in a bid to establish more about the investigation.
