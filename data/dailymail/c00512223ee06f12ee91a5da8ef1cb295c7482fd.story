Arrest: Danny Care, 25, has been held on suspicion of sexually assaulting a woman in Leeds

England rugby player Danny Care has been questioned about an alleged sexual assault on a woman in a nightclub.

The 25-year-old Harlequins and England scrum half was arrested by West Yorkshire Police officers following an incident in Leeds.

Care has already accepted a police caution for being drunk and disorderly on the same night after he was arrested for urinating outside the city's landmark Queens Hotel.

He was questioned again earlier this month in connection with a sexual assault on the woman.

The player had now been bailed pending further inquiries over the alleged incident in the early hours of Sunday March 4. His club said today he denies the allegation.

A spokesman for Harlequins said: 'Danny Care was asked to report to West Yorkshire Police in Leeds to answer further questions about the incident that took place in the city on March 3.

'On March 15 Danny attended Leeds Police Station voluntarily by appointment to assist the police with their inquiries. He denies the allegations made against him.

'Harlequins are fully aware of all the facts and will continue to support Danny as he addresses this situation.'

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'A 25-year-old man, from Surrey, was arrested in connection with a sexual assault on a woman in Leeds in the early hours of Sunday, March 4.

'He has been bailed pending further inquiries.'

Earlier this month, England coach Stuart Lancaster warned Care he risks wasting his international career following the drunk and disorderly incident - his third drink-related arrest in three months.

The player was held outside a Weybridge bar in December.

In January, Care was fined a total of Â£3,100 and banned from driving for 16 months after pleading guilty to drink-driving in the early hours of New Year's Day.

He was stopped at the Winchester services on the M3 motorway in Hampshire in the early hours, Southampton Magistrates' Court heard.

He was barred from playing for England following this conviction.
