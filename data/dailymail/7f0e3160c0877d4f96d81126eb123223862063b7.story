A grandfather was killed and his wife is fighting for her life after they were run over by their own car.

Neighbours said Iftikhar Ali, 65, and wife Hazim, 63, were crushed under the estate vehicle when it rolled down a steep hill outside their home as they loaded the boot yesterday morning.

Mr Ali is believed to have tried to stop the runaway Peugeot 406, but was dragged underneath along with his wife as it rolled more than 50 yards.

Police were called to the steep street in Brynmill, Swansea (above), where a man and woman were trapped under a car. The man was killed in the incident while the woman was airlifted to hospital

Firefighters lifted the car off the couple, but Mr Ali suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mrs Ali, who was conscious, was airlifted to hospital, where last night she was said to be in a critical condition.

It is not known whether the car’s brakes failed or there was a fault that caused the car to roll.

The couple are believed to have moved to Britain from Iraq more than 20 years ago and lived a quiet life in a basement flat in Swansea’s Brynmill district.

The residential street in Brynmill, Swansea, is on a steep hill. Police said the car 'rolled down' towards the man and woman involved in the incident at around 9.20am 

Neighbour Paul Thomas said: ‘They have been here for many years and were very private people. But they were very devoted to each other and were always together. They were very polite and always said hello.’

The car will have mechanical tests as police compile a report for an inquest into the tragedy. 

'Initial reports are that a vehicle has rolled down the street trapping a male and female underneath the vehicle,' a spokesman for South Wales Police said this morning. 

'The female has been conveyed to hospital by air ambulance. The male sustained fatal injuries.'
