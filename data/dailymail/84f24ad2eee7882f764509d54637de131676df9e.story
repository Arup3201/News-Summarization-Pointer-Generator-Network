Components originating from Britain are being used inside North Korean missiles, a UN report has claimed.

Temperature gauges, pressure gauges and generic resistors manufactured by unidentified companies based in Britain were found among debris recovered from the sea after a North Korea missile test in December 2012, the UN Panel of Experts concluded in an 127-page report.

The discovery has led to questions over how British parts found their way into North Korea's illegal programme to manufacture intercontinental ballistic missiles - especially as the country is currently under UN sanctions banning the delivery of military goods.

As well as the British equipment, parts made in the U.S., Switzerland, and China were discovered among the debris of an Unha-3 rocket that crashed after an event Pyongyang described as a satellite launch.

The U.S. said the satellite claims were nonsense however, adding that North Korea had in fact been testing intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The Panel of Experts described all the British parts found in the missile as 'off-the-shelf items that do not meet any of the specifications in the lists of prohibited items, in particular the ballistic missile-related list.'

The report said that all the British items had entered North Korea through third party countries - including Taiwan - with some of them arriving as recently as 2011.

The report did not name the manufacturers of the items.

Evidence: Although the foreign parts may have found their way into North Korea innocently, the UN report said they proved Kim Jong-un's ability 'to assemble complex systems with globally sourced components'

Only one foreign item found among the debris met some but not all of the criteria defined by the list of items banned from being exported into North Korea under the current UN sanctions.

These were radial ball bearings found inside the turbo pumps of the four rocket motors.

However the report said these items were likely to have been made in the 1980s in the former Soviet Union, so could easily have passed into North Korea long before the UN restrictions were installed.

Although the foreign parts may have found their way into North Korea innocently, the UN report said they proved Pyongyang's ability 'to assemble complex systems with globally sourced components'.

'The acquisition of components abroad for its prohibited programmes despite its Juche philosophy of self-reliance points to the limitations of its own industrial production capabilities,' the report added.

Ready for action: Earlier this week it was reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un told his military chiefs to prepare the nation's soldiers (pictured) for war against South Korea in 2015

Within the report, a number of Taiwanese companies and individuals were named as being suspected of purchasing dual-use components on behalf of North Korea.

The UN said this aspect of the report would need further investigation.

This is not the first time dual-use components have found their way an international debate about military sanctions.

In 1998 Iraq's then leader Saddam Hussein launched 'Project Babylon' - a campaign with objectives that remain unclear to this day but involved plans to build a series of 'superguns'.

Dual-use components have long been part of the debate about military sanctions. In 1988 Saddam Hussein launched a campaign to assemble 'superguns' using metal tubes built in Britain (pictured)

Many of the parts for the weapons were made from dual-use items made by various companies in Europe - including metal tubes for the barrels and gun cradles purchased from Sheffield Forgemasters in South Yorkshire and Walter Somers in Worcestershire.

The majority of the parts were seized in transit and destroyed, but the resulting debate over the export of dual-use items led to more stringent restrictions on what could be exported to countries that were under sanctions.

Earlier this week it was reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un told his military chiefs to prepare for war against South Korea in 2015.

According to South Korea's largest daily newspaper, a source has revealed that the dictator plans to invade and has ordered the army to remain 'combat-ready'.
