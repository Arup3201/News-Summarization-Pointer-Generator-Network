What is the biggest concern for a Navy veteran, with no formal managerial experience, preparing to lead another country's team out in front of 30,000 of his baying compatriots?

'Suit or tracksuit?' jokes Gibraltar's interim head coach Davie Wilson, who will attempt to guide UEFA's newest member to an historic result at Hampden Park on Sunday.

He adds: 'Growing up in Scotland, it's a boyhood dream to step out at Hampden for your country. But to step out for another country against your own country… I'm totally mixed with emotions.

'I'm massively humbled, yet there's a little devil on my other shoulder saying, 'What are you doing? People might never speak to you again'.'

But the 41-year-old freely admits it would take a very poor performance from Gordon Strachan's men for his charges to leave Glasgow with anything more than pride.

Wilson, part-time head coach, part-time exercise rehabilitation officer, was on the books at Kilmarnock during his teens, but decided the Navy offered a more realistic opportunity. After two decades at sea, Gibraltar was to be his final port of call, and he has an obvious fondness for the British territory.

'I miss the Scottish scenery but where I am now ticks the boxes,' he says. 'After 21 years travelling the world, I've found somewhere I feel is home.'

The former assistant head coach, who was handed the reins just three weeks ago, is enjoying every minute of his adventure but the national anthems will throw up an unusual dilemma. 'How do you stop a Scotsman singing Flower of Scotland? You can't,' he admits. 'If it was New Year's Eve I'd be on the table singing it like I meant it! At Hampden I'll be singing it, but I don't have to show that passion.

Scotland are heavy favourites for the clash and will be expecting to vastly improve their goal difference

'I'll be passionate during the Gibraltar national anthem. I've sung it every game for the last two and a half years and I've felt the hairs rise on my arm. On Sunday I'll feel the hairs rise for both anthems.

'Gibraltarians are close to the Scots in terms of being passionate about who they are. As a nation, Scotland feel they're not given the freedom they deserve, Gibraltar is the same.'

The debutant manager must prepare his squad with only three professional footballers. Their occupations range from policemen and firemen to solicitors and customs officers. How must Wilson have felt when his team lined up against the Germans in Nuremberg last November?

He says: 'As world champions, they were expected to trounce us. I listened to Alan McInally's commentary and, when Thomas Muller scored the first goal, he said, 'I'm fully expecting the Germans to put on a cricket score tonight'. But they didn't. (They won 4-0). You could see it in their manager's face when we had a shot at goal, and a second shot at goal and a corner. He was angry.

'We've got to build for the next 10 or 20 years. We won't find a Lionel Messi in a country of 30,000 — there will be more people in the crowd on Sunday than in our entire country.'

Wilson would clearly relish the chance to oversee Gibraltar's development on a permanent basis.

'It's starting to sit better on my shoulders,' he says. 'I feel confident in my ability and now I'm thinking, 'why not me?'. If I was offered the job I'd bite their hand off.'

But whatever happens, Wilson will always have his place in history.

'Not even you journalists could have written this story,' he says.

'If nothing happens after Sunday's game I'll always have this memory.

'I'll tell my grandkids, 'You know, your grandad managed a football team once'. They'd laugh — 'Of course you did grandad. Now tell us another Navy story.'
