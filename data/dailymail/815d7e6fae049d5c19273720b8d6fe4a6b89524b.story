Wasteful: Chair of the Home Affairs Select Commitee Keith Vaz said the figures show how taxpayer's money was wasted

The now-disbanded UK Border Agency spent more than £13 million in the last year to cover immigrants’ legal fees in cases it lost, accounts have shown.

The Agency's adverse legal costs rose by more than 44per cent compared with the previous year.

The troubled organisation, which was abolished in March, paid adverse legal costs when they lost a case and were ordered to cover the costs of the successful party.

Critics of the agency who called for it to be shut down, say the figures show who troubled the immigration system is.

Keith Vaz MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'I am astonished that these figures are so high.

'This
is a complete waste of taxpayers’ money. Ultimately, the legal fees are
the result of poor decision-making by the former UKBA.

'If the Home Office had concentrated on fixing the system rather than covering up backlogs this figure would have been less.'

The UKBA spent £2.5 million on flights originally booked to remove ineligible asylum seekers, which had to be cancelled when the asylum seekers were granted the right to appeal.

The amount was a 24per cent increase on the previous year.

The adverse legal costs come under the 'special payments' section of the UKBA accounts, which in total surged 
37per cent to £21.9 million in 2012/13 from £15.5 million in the previous year.

The figures have been disclosed in the UKBA’s final annual report.

The Home Secretary, Theresa May, split the Agency into two bodies- UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which are now under the control of ministers.

Poor performance: The UKBA was disbanded in March. Its final annual spending report shows increases in the amount spent on adverse legal costs, including a pay out of more than £240,000 to one family

Adverse legal costs in cases with a 
cumulative total of less than £250,000 added up to £12.6 million- an 
increase of 44per cent from £8.7 million in the previous year.

Special payments made in cases with cumulative totals of more than £250,000 increased by 19per cent to £1.6 million.

A
family who challenges their removal were paid £104,000 in adverse legal
costs. An extra £138,000 in adverse legal costs was paid to five 
individuals of the same family in relation to an unlawful detention 
claim.

£1 million was spent in returned appeal fees after losing challenges referred to the Immigration Appeals Tribunal.

The Home Affairs Select Committee warned it would take the UKBA 24 years to clear a backlog of asylum and immigration cases.

Flawed: The head of UK Visas and Immigration Sarah Rapson said the service will never be seen as 'perfect'

The head of the new UK Visas and 
Immigration Section recently told the committee that Britain’s 
immigration service will never be completely fixed.

Director general Sarah Rapson warned that the service will never be seen as 'perfect'.

The annual report said that in the last year, the UKBA disrupted 89 organised crime gangs, saw 4,546 foreign national prisoners deported, removed 42,429 migrants with no legal right to remain, and refused entry to a further 13,606 at port.

In addition, the Agency also decided around 2.6 million overseas applications for visas from visitors, students, migrants and other people who wanted to come to the UK.
