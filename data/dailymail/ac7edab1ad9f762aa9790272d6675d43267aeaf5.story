Prosecutors have said Osama bin Laden's son-in-law should be sentenced to life in prison for his role as al-Qaida's spokesman after 9/11, when he made 'bone-chilling threats' against America.

The US government has said a life sentence for Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who was convicted in March of charges that included conspiracy to kill Americans and providing support to al-Qaida, would send out an important deterrent to would-be terrorists. 

Prosecutors, who described Abu Ghaith's words as 'inciting, murderous and hateful', said: 'Terrorism is a crime with high recidivism rates and rehabilitation is notoriously difficult.'

Prosecutors have said Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, should be sentenced to life in prison for his role as al-Qaida's spokesman after 9/11, when he made 'bone-chilling threats' against America

Papers have been filed in the US District Court in Manhattan a month before Abu Ghaith was due to be sentenced on September 23.

Earlier this month, Abu Ghaith's defense lawyer Stanley Cohen told Judge Lewis A. Kaplan that 15 years in prison was a sufficient sentence.

Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti-born imam, married bin Laden's eldest daughter roughly five years ago. He is the highest-ranking al-Qaida figure brought to trial on U.S. soil since the 2001 attacks.

According to the papers filed by prosecutors, Abu Ghaith 'proudly sat at bin Laden's right hand' following the 9/11 attacks, repeatedly participating in al-Qaida recruitment videos.

In their papers, prosecutors wrote: 'Abu Ghayth repeatedly made unambiguous and bone-chilling threats that al Qaeda would continue to conduct terrorist attacks using airplanes.

'Simply put, the defendant eagerly supported al Qaeda and its mass murder of Americans,' they said. 

Frames of a video made September 12, 2001 (pictured) were shared in court showing Abu Ghaith seated next to bin Laden and two other top al-Qaida leaders as they tried to justify the attacks

'The significance of Abu Ghayth's spoken words is unmistakable. Inspirational and charismatic speakers like Abu Ghayth allow al Qaeda to refill its ranks of suicide operatives by driving more future terrorists to al Qaeda's murderous mission.'

In a dramatic testimony during his trial, Abu Ghaith told how he was summoned to a dark cave in Afghanistan within hours of the destruction of the World Trade Center to speak with bin Laden, who told him: 'We are the ones who did it.' 

Abu Ghaith testified that a worried bin Laden asked him how America would respond.

'America, if it was proven that you were the one who did this, will not settle until it accomplishes two things: to kill you and topple the state of the Taliban,' Abu Ghaith said he replied.

In his papers, Cohen said his client had no prior knowledge or role in the planning or execution of the 9/11 attacks or any other bombing or terrorist activity.

'His role was confined to speaking, after the attacks had already happened,' he wrote.

Cohen said a sentence of 15 years would really be 25 years, since Abu Ghaith spent a decade in prison in Iran, much of it under extreme conditions which included abuse and torture.

But prosecutors disputed those claims, saying Abu Ghaith formed a community with other Arab detainees and even married two women while incarcerated, fathering multiple children along the way.
