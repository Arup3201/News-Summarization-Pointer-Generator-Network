It was a call that changed his life. 

After a decade without speaking to her, Dan Watson was contacted by his mother Lynn from Ireland last year after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer.

The 34 year old Sydney man resolved to turn over a new leaf after hearing the shocking news and decided to hike a staggering 5,000 kilometres across Australia for charity.

‘I was in a bad place at the time. I realised the only way I was going to make it through the other end of the tunnel was to do something selfless. I had to put others first,’ Dan told Daily Mail Australia.  

Dan Watson, 34, has embarked upon a 5000km solo mega-walk from Perth to Sydney with nothing but a custom made trolley to carry the bare necessities

In a bid to repair his relationship with his mother, Dan embarked on the inspiring mega-walk from Fremantle to Sydney to raise money for the Cancer Council NSW and national mental health charity SANE.

‘My mother phoned last year from Ireland to say she needed me. She was going through her third round of chemotherapy. I knew it was very serious,’ he said. 

The Sydney advertising worker said he had blamed his parents for the anxiety and depression that has plagued him throughout his life, but the walk offered him a means of mending his familial fences.

‘The thought of losing out on the chance to settle our differences made me sick to my bones. I needed to show her I still cared.’ 

Watson arrives to Melbourne with 'Blue Steele', a trolley his friends named to give it more personal value

Watson said he had to remind himself that while trip was physically exhausting, it was trivial compared to what his mother was enduring

Dan said the biggest hurdle of the walk was the Nullarbor Desert, a vast and barren swathe of land in South Australia

Before starting the journey, Dan had a custom built trolley made to cart necessities like clothing and food.

'My friends named it Blue Steele. That way it had a human quality and I was more likely to look after it.'

He said the biggest hurdle of the walk, which is set to come to a close this weekend when he arrives at Bondi Beach, was the Nullarbor Desert - a vast and barren swathe of land in southern Australia.

‘It's extremely arid and hot. Towards the end of the desert I began to lose my nerve. I was famished, as there were virtually no supermarkets for food.’

‘I started to get this foreboding feeling of regret, that it was all a waste. I just about lost my marbles.

'But I had to tell myself it was only temporary, that my suffering was trivial compared to what my mum was going through.’

Dan said he lost over 20kgs over the journey and was left 'looking like a malnourished marathon runner'

He is set to complete the mammoth hike this Sunday when he arrives at Bondi Beach

Watson said he expects to reach his goal of raising 20,000 for the Cancer Foundation NSW and SANE, a national mental health charity

While he was lean going into the journey, Dan said he lost over 20kgs.

‘I began the journey at about 77kg. By the end of the Nullabar I was about 55kg. I looked like a malnourished marathon runner,’ he said.

He expects to reach his goal of raising $20,000 when he completes the mammoth hike this Sunday at Bondi Beach.
