The popular children's cartoon SuperTed is set to be remade following an absence of more than 30 years from Britain's television screens.

A decision has been made by the BBC, which screened the show in the 1980s, to produce 26 new episodes which will air in 2016.

However the show's characters, which featured 'a fat guy who had jokes made about his weight', will be toned down for a modern audience.

Time to say the secret magic words: 1980s children's cartoon SuperTed is set to return to television screens following a remake suitable for a modern audience

Danger Mouse - The 1980s animated TV series which featured a mouse who worked as a secret agent is set to return on CBBC in 2015.

The Teletubbies - A 1990s show whose alien characters had TV sets implanted in their abdomens will show on CBBC though it is not known when the new episodes will be broadcast.

Thunderbirds - The 1960s science fiction series which featured marionette puppetry will air on ITV in 2015.

The Wombles - TV's cute, furry litter-picking creatures that rose to fame on the BBC in the 1970s will return on Channel 5 in 2015.

Bob the Builder - Everyone's favourite handyman, which screened in the late 1990s, is being developed by Hit Entertainment and will be back in 2015.

SuperTed featured the adventures of a discarded teddy bear who is turned 
into a superhero with a dashing of cosmic dust and Mother Nature’s 
secret magic wand.

He was joined by alien friends Spotty and Blotch, who together fight villains Texas Pete, Skeleton and Bulk.

BBC producers hope original voice actors Derek Griffiths, who narrated SuperTed himself, and Melvyn Hayes, who narrated Skeleton, and will return.

Roy Kinnear, who voiced the villain Bulk, died in 1988.

However Mr Young, who broke news of the remake in the Radio Times, has warned viewers to expect some changes to make the series more appropriate for a contemporary audience.

He said: ‘Popeye used to smash people in the face. It was very funny, but no television network would let you do that now.

‘In SuperTed, we had a gun-slinging cowboy, a gay skeleton and a fat guy who had jokes made about his weight – things you wouldn’t do today. But you can still write it in a funny way.’

The Welsh cartoon is one of several classic children's programmes being brought back, which include favourites like the Teletubbies and Dangermouse.

Children's TV favourites Bob the Builder and The Wombles are also set to return to the small screen
