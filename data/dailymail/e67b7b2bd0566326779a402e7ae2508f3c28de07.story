A woman has lost an incredible 19.8st - more than half her 43st body weight - following dangerous weight loss surgery

Morbidly obese Tara Taylor, 35, developed a complex and deeply unhealthy relationship with food after being raped at the age of 26, using food to comfort herself and her size as a way of protecting herself from the world.

But after her son Darren, six, told her that all his classmates called her fat, Tara made the decision to lose weight for the sake of her children.

Tara's 43st weight meant she was mainly confined to her bed and in near constant pain

Tara dropped from 43.2st (left) to 23.4st (left) in the course of 12 months after opting for risky bypass surgery

The mother-of-two, from Lafayette in Louisiana, had tipped the scales at a staggering 606lbs (43.2st) and suffered from numerous health problems that left her bed bound and unable to care for her children.

She could barely walk and spent most of her days in bed while her mother Paula cooked her meals and cared for the children.

Speaking on TLC's My 600lb Life ahead of the operation, Tara said: 'I’m disgusted with myself. If I could cut it off I would.

'There’s a lot of things in my life that’s hard and because of my size I don’t do much of anything. Basically my day in stuck in the bed.

'I’m in constant pain. My weight has worn
 down the cartilage in my knees so when I walk it is literally bone on 
bone. My back hurts because my stomach hangs so far down. I’m just 
tired.'

Tara used food as an emotional crutch and her size as a means of protection against the world

Worse, Tara also said her children, Darren and Felicity, were missing out on being raised by their mother with grandmother Paula doing the bulk of the childcare instead.

‘She
 does everything for them,' explained Tara. 'But she’s getting too old to be doing what 
she’s doing - I should be taking care of her.

'I want to be there for my 
children. I want to see them play sports and see them grow up.

'Ever since I can remember I have been
 overweight,' she continued. 'It didn’t really dawn on me about my size until when I was
 13 years old I stepped on the scales and it read 187.5lb [13st 4lbs] but I just 
brushed it off. When I graduated high school I was 352lb [25st 1lb].

'My
 food is an addiction. Food doesn’t judge me whether I’m happy or sad, 
angry, upset- I always have food. Food has always been my safe haven.'

But although she'd always been big, the trigger for the weight gain that took her to a massive 43st 2lb was a traumatic rape at the age of 26.

After becoming pregnant by her rapist, Tara then suffered a miscarriage and in the aftermath, began eating more 'to feel safe and unattractive' to men.

Tara also felt her size meant she was missing out on raising daughter Felicity and son Darren, who had to interact with her on her bed

Although Tara's mother prepared most of her food, Tara, who admitted she ate 6 times a day, was able to cook for herself sitting down

‘When I was 26 I was raped and I got pregnant from the rape and had a miscarriage,' she revealed. 'I
 was heavy, but afterwards I just got heavier. I felt that if I got more
 unattractive no man would want to touch me and I would be safe.

'It made me not care. I didn’t care about anyone else's feelings. After I eat I feel disgusted, angry at myself. I beat myself up about it.’

Despite her size - and her inability to cook for herself - Tara's mother Paula says she felt unable to deny her requests for food.

‘I’m helping her to stay like she is 
because it is hard to serve her and tell her, "That’s all you can have",' she explained. 'I
 always end up giving into her… she’s my child.’

With dieting made difficult by her situation, Tara travelled to Texas to consult leading bariatric surgeon, Dr Younan Nowazaradan in a bid to lose weight.

Tara travelled to Texas to meet with Dr Nowzaradan, who described her condition as 'critical' and undergo surgery

Demanding that she make an effort to change her unhealthy habits on her own before undergoing surgery, Dr Nowzaradan instructed Tara – who admitted she ate at least six times a day- to lose 20lbs in a month at home.

‘Tara’s conditional is critical. If she doesn’t start to lose weight, I don’t think she will live another five years,’ he warned.

The surgery, which left her with a stomach the size of a boiled egg, was a success, although Tara admits she did have trouble adapting to her new diet at first.

‘Changing your eating habits is hard, especially when your whole life you have turned to food to make you happy,’ she explained.

Despite disappointing initial weight loss, Tara's surgery goes ahead, with her son admitting to her at her bedside that he is teased at school over her size

Tara's weight led to complications during surgery, but it was a success; reducing the size of Tara's stomach to about the same as a boiled egg

Despite a bumpy start to sticking to her diet, Tara eventually becomes committed, walking more and even starting at a gym

A year later, Tara has lost almost half her body weight, and can now walk around the supermarket instead of having to ride on a scooter, and can help her son get ready for school in the morning.

‘A year ago I was at the lowest point in my life,' she says. 'I will never forget who that 600lb person was; I will always love her but I sure won’t miss her.

‘Now I have a world of possibilities and I just can’t wait to start living my life.'
