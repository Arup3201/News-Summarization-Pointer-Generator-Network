Sauber have snapped up Marcus Ericsson to race for them next season after the collapse of the Caterham team.

The Swede, 24, made his debut in Formula One this season but is not racing at this weekend's United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas after Caterham were put into administration.

Ericsson, who matched Caterham's highest-ever finish of 11th at Monaco earlier in the season, admitted he had endured a tough time of it amid the financial uncertainty but is delighted to now be able to look forward.

'Fresh from a very turbulent week, I was suddenly given my best early Christmas present ever,' Ericsson said on the team's website. 'The Sauber F1 Team has put its trust in me for 2015, and it makes me proud, as Sauber is known to be one of the best teams in developing young drivers. It will be a great challenge.

'I will give my very best to develop both as a driver, and to be part of the challenge to put the Sauber F1 Team back closer to the front where it belongs.'

The move leaves the futures of both Sauber's current drivers Esteban Gutierrez and Adrian Sutil in doubt, with a team statement saying the second driver would be named 'at a later date'.

Team principal Monisha Kaltenborn believes the sport is yet to see the best of Ericsson.

'We are pleased to announce this cooperation,' Kaltenborn said. 'We have got to know Marcus as a highly motivated driver. He did not have an easy rookie season this year in Formula One, however, he kept calm and improved continuously, mainly in the last races.

'We are convinced that signing Marcus can give the team a fresh impetus.'
