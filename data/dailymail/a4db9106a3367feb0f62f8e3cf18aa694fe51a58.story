Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel says a new contract for David De Gea would send an important message as the Old Trafford club look to get back to the top.

De Gea's fine form this season in an otherwise shaky United side has raised fears that the Spanish goalkeeper could make a move to Real Madrid with just a year-and-a-half left on his contract.

And Schmeichel, who won five Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League title with United, says the club must tie the stopper down to show their rivals at home and abroad that they mean business after a difficult 18 months following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.

'It's very important the club's best players sign new contracts to send a signal,' Schmeichel told Sky Sports.

'It shows that they believe in the Manchester United project and believe the club will go back not only to the top of the Premier League but also European football.'

A sixth-place finish under David Moyes last season saw United fail to qualify for Europe at all but with United in fourth place and with an FA Cup quarter-final on the horizon, prospects are looking better this season.

With signings like Angel di Maria coming in, United are certainly hoping to fulfil De Gea's ambitions

However, their indifferent form makes a title charge an unlikely prospect although a new deal for De Gea would be a huge boost to their hopes next year. 

'If De Gea signs a new deal it would be a very big signal,' Schmeichel added. 'I'm sure everyone who loves the club would love that.

'Fingers crossed he will sign another five-year contract.'
