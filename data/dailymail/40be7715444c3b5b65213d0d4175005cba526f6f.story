A new female action figure is leading a campaign to encourage young girls to challenge the traditional beauty standards promoted by Barbie and other mainstream fashion dolls.

The plastic blonde heroine, which comes complete with its own construction kit and zipline, is the brainchild of toy company GoldieBlox, an independent start-up that wants to ‘disrupt the pink aisle’ and inspire girls to rebel against conformity and become engineers.

To promote the new toy, GoldieBlox has released an edgy video that is reminiscent of Apple's famous Orwellian '1984' Super Bowl ad. It features an ominous Big Sister character who drones 'You are beauty, and beauty is perfection' as a line of pink-clad girls solemnly pluck identically dressed dolls from a conveyor belt in a dystopian factory setting.

Pure heroine: GoldieBlox has created a new female action figure who comes with a construction kit and her very own zipline

'Fashion dolls teach girls to value beauty over brains. One is sold every three seconds,' the spot tells viewers.

Eventually a rebel wearing denim overalls and a toolbelt emerges from the pack with a hammer and smashes the machine, encouraging her peers to kick off their sparkly heels and have some fun.

Set to Metric's Help I'm Alive, the clip ends with the action figure emerging on the belt brandishing a tiny hammer, as the words 'In 2014, GoldieBlox breaks the mold with an action figure for girls' appear on screen.

Dressed for success: She comes in a tomboyish ensemble, consisting of overalls, red Chuck Taylors and a toolbelt

Hanging tough: The toy's ability to suspend from the 13-inch zipline is mean to improve children's spacial skills and introduce basic engineering principles

In good shape: The plastic figure has articulated shoulders, hips, knees and joints, and her hands and feet are 'designed for action'

The GoldieBlox Zipline Action Figure, which costs $24.99, has articulated shoulders, hips, knees and joints, and her hands and feet are 'designed for action,' according to the company's website.

She comes dressed in a tomboyish ensemble, consisting of overalls, red Chuck Taylors and a toolbelt.

GoldieBlox, founded by Stanford-educated engineer Debbie Sterling, generated buzz last year with a clever ad that showed three young girls creating a Rube Goldberg machine.

The company manufactured an interactive book series and construction set starring a young inventor named Goldie after a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign.

'When I spent time with families to observe how boys and girls played, I found that with construction toys, girls were asking, "Why are we building it?" or "Why should we care?"' Ms Sterling told Time in February.

Breaking the mold: The clip ends with the action figure emerging on the conveyor belt with a tiny hammer

'So my aha moment for how to appeal to girls was to kind of toss out the instruction manual and instead write stories about this girl engineer. She builds things to solve problems and help her friends.'

She added: 'By using KickStarter we were able to show that there actually was a market demand for this engineering toy for girls that initially I had been warned was very niche and wasn’t marketable.'
