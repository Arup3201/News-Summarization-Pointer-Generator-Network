A female singer staying in a hotel on her own was terrified when she turned on the television and the words 'I am going to rape you' appeared on the screen.

Songwriter Kimberly Anne from London was staying at the Whitemare Pool Travelodge in Gateshead.

She is supporting Swedish band First Aid Kit on their UK tour and was playing in Newcastle the night before the message appeared when she switched on her TV.

The hotel chain has apologised to the singer for her ordeal and launched an investigation into how its TV messaging system could be abused.

Her ordeal was revealed when she tweeted a picture of the message and said: 'Thanks @TravelodgeUK as a woman staying alone in one of your rooms this is great. Check your tv welcome messages'.

However, she later praised the hotel chain for taking her complaint seriously.

A later tweet read: 'Shout out to @TravelodgeUK for taking what I posted yesterday seriously and doing all they can to put a stop to the sick sado responsible'

Hotels often have messaging systems connected to TVs in each room - but they are usually only used in an emergency. 

A spokesperson for Travelodge said: 'We can confirm that a customer has advised

us that an unauthorised message was placed on a television in one of our hotels.

'We have already been in contact with the customer involved and apologised that such a message could appear.

'We take the security of our guests and our systems very seriously and while this is an isolated incident, applicable to only one room, we have consequently launched a full investigation with our television supplier.

'We will take the appropriate action to address any issues that are identified by our investigation and in the interim, we have reaffirmed our guidance to team-members regarding checks on the status of televisions in our guest-rooms.'
