Baggy jumpers and elasticated leggings are most mothers go-to clothes when they're just a month away from giving birth.

One mother-to-be, however, refuses to hide her eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it on social media for the world to see.

Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old lingerie model and animal rights activist, has documented her changing figure on her Instagram page - and her followers can hardly believe how far gone she is.

Sarah Stage, a Los Angeles-based lingerie model, has been documenting her changing pregnancy body and many of her 1.1m Instagram followers cannot believe she is eight months pregnant 

Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent and lives in Los Angeles, shuns baggy dresses and instead dresses her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all.

The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa, spinach and chicken.

Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah has continued to model whilst carrying.

Sarah is a lingerie model and animal rights activist and adorns billboards in the states 

Sarah's first modelling gig was at the tender age of two and the star, who is signed to Elite Model Management, has since adorned billboards and starred in countless campaigns.

According to Malaysian Digest, Sarah indulges in occasional cheeseburgers and maintains her trim frame is down to daily gym visits.

Comments from her followers include ones such as: 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'my belly after a burger'.

The model credits her svelte figure to her regular work-out sessions in the gym 

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant.

'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.'

Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman.

When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy.

Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established. 

Comments from her followers include ones such as: 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'I had to look at it for ages to notice she was pregnant'

Sarah has over 1m Instagram followers who regularly comment on her trim baby body 

Dr Venkat says women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy but Sarah is clearly keen to continue with her regular gym sessions
