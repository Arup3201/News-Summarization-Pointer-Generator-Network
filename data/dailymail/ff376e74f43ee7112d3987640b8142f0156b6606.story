Baby brothers Gavin and Declan are peacefully sleeping side by side, but the twins’ birth was a lot more dramatic.

Their mother Siobhan Anderson gave birth to her two little boys on two different highways before she could make it to hospital.

Mrs Anderson was on her way to hospital when she realised her twins were not going to wait any longer. She turned to her husband Bryan and told him to call an ambulance.

Twins: Declan and Gavin sleep peacefully in their mother's arms, together again after being born on two separate highways

The New York mother-of-three gave 
birth to baby Gavin by the side of the road on a stretcher and not long 
after paramedics had loaded her into the ambulance he was joined by 
Declan.

Mrs Anderson’s water broke nearly a week before her due date in the early hours of Saturday morning in the couple’s home in Amityville, New York.

On the way to the hospital, she said she felt a big contraction and suddenly felt the baby’s head.

She told her husband to pull over and that she was going to give birth by the wayside.

‘She kept screaming, “The babies are coming,”, Mr Anderson said.  ‘I was like, “I think we have time to at least get to the hospital”.’

However he quickly realised that was not the case and called 911.

Yawn! Declan - or is it Gavin - seems disinterested in the attention him and his brother's birth have got them

When paramedics arrived Mrs Anderson told them she would not be able move because ‘she was holding the baby in’ and as predicted gave birth to Gavin on the ambulance stretcher on the side of the Southern State Parkway.

‘As soon as I moved, he came out’ she told Long Island Newsday. ‘He was born at 7:35 in the open air.'

The plan was to drive to nearby Nassau University Medical Center in time for Siobhan to give birth to her second baby.

But little Declan had other plans.

As the ambulance was driving down Wantagh State Parkway en-route to the hospital, they were forced to pull over as baby number two was on his way.

 Less than ten minutes after his brother had been born Declan came into the world in the back of the ambulance.

The family, which also includes proud older brother Dylan, two, are all doing great and Siobhan told CBS 2 that they are considering nicknaming the boys ‘Southie’ and ‘W-3′.
