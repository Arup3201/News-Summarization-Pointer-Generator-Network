Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from up and down the country.

1. Mario Balotelli appears to drift through games but he's actually working harder than you'd think.

He covered 5.2 miles in his 79 minutes against Chelsea. That is equivalent to 5.8 miles across 90 minutes – which just happens to be the average distance covered by Luis Suarez in games against the top four last season.

Mario Balotelli may not be finding the net with the same regularity as Luis Suarez did at Liverpool, but he is running the same as the Uruguayan did against the top four teams last season

2. Geordie Paul Dummett's emergence has been a huge bonus for Alan Pardew this season - and the left back, who made his Wales debut in the summer, has now also proved he can play as a central defender.

The 23-year-old product of the club's youth system performed brilliantly alongside Fabricio Coloccini in the 2-0 win at West Brom, keeping new England star Saido Berahino to just one shot on goal.

His 13 clearances were more than the rest of Newcastle's defenders put together.

3. Gareth Barry's nasty injury at Sunderland gave Darron Gibson a chance to return to Premier League action – and the former Manchester United midfielder seized the opportunity.

The 26-year-old, out for 11 months after cruciate ligament surgery, had played just eight minutes of League football so far.

But after replacing Barry at Sunderland with just 13 minutes gone he performed like he'd not been away.

No Premier League player all weekend hit more accurate passes in the attacking half than the 52 that Gibson produced – just a shame none of them got turned into a goal in the 1-1 draw.

4. Joey Barton's appearance as a second half sub to replace the injured Sandro against Manchester City was his first action since getting injured in mid-September, and he made a compelling case to get back in QPR's starting line-up.

He won tackles to break up Manchester City's play, and got on the ball enough to hit 23 accurate passes in his 45 minutes compared to just nine achieved by former Spurs star Sandro in the first half.

He also covered more ground – 3.8 miles of running compared to Sandro's 3.3.

5. Nathaniel Clyne's elevation to the England squad is encouraging fellow Southampton full back Ryan Bertrand to match his standards.

Bertrand, on loan from Chelsea but likely to make his move to St Mary's permanent in January, has made sure the attacking flair of Luke Shaw hasn't been missed since his £30million move to Manchester United.

Against Leicester he played 73 passes compared to Clyne's 68, was accurate with 83.6 per cent of them against 77.9, and also covered a fraction more ground at 6.9 miles versus 6.8.

6. Steve Bruce said it was a tough decision to sell Scotland winger George Boyd to Burnley during the summer, describing the 29-year-old as 'the sort of lad you'd be glad if your daughter brought home.' 

Boyd was clearly eager to make Bruce regret the £3million transfer even more, playing a starring role as his new club recorded their first Premier League win of the season.

He ran 8.1 miles in the game – the most ground covered by any player in all the weekend's Premier League fixtures.

7. Middlesbrough's fans are warming to the progress being made by Aitor Karanka who on Thursday will celebrate a year in charge at The Riverside.

The crowd of 22,930 who watched their 0-0 draw with Bournemouth was the highest attendance since 23,679 saw them play Bolton shortly after the Spaniard took over.

Boro's average gates, which hit 28,428 in their last Premier League campaign in 2008-09, had fallen to 16,794 by last season.

8. Uwe Rosler is another Championship manager who will shortly celebrate his first anniversary in charge – but things are less happy for the Wigan boss.

In the relegation zone after the 3-1 collapse at Bolton, even if he wins his next two games at home to Middlesbrough and at Sheffield Wednesday he will only have the same 22 points from 19 games for which Owen Coyle was sacked last year.

9. Experienced Micky Adams has had an instant impact since taking over at Tranmere after they had slumped to 92nd place in the football pyramid.

After losing his first match in charge he is unbeaten in four now – and scored his first victory by knocking in-form Bristol Rovers out of the FA Cup despite playing the last half an hour with ten men.

One of his key decisions was to restore Welsh squad man Owain Fon Williams as first choice goalkeeper, and the 27-year-old was in outstanding form on Saturday.

10. After a week of doom and gloom in Europe for Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and to a lesser extent Chelsea, at least one English side enjoyed a Champions League triumph.

Bristol's women's team – now run under the same umbrella management as current League One leaders Bristol City – have got one foot in the quarter-finals after going to Barcelona and winning 1-0.

A Marta Corredera own goal, and some brilliant work by Bristol keeper Mary Earps, gave them a lead to take into Thursday's second leg at Ashton Gate.
