A vintage motorbike which once set a world speed record has sold for an astonishing £113,500 at auction.

The 1952 Vincent 998cc Black Shadow is a classic machine from a bygone age when Britain ruled the motorcycle world.

It was used in world record speed trials in Montlhery, France, in May 1952, where the bike set a six-hour record at more than 100mph - an incredible achievement for the time.

This Vincent Black Shadow motorbike, which once set a world speed record, has sold for £113,500 at auction

The vintage bike got its name from the fact the entire vehicle was painted black

The fully restored, ex-works machine 
had formed part of the Vincent factory's bid to set a new 24-hour speed record.

Although mechanical failures 
prevented the challenge from being successful, the British team returned home 
with eight new records.

The tiny British company was so far ahead of its time that it wasn't until the 1970s that Japanese manufacturers came along with faster production machines.

The Vincent Black Shadow - so called because the entire vehicle was painted black - was bought by motorcycle dealer George Petch, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, in 1970 and he rode it for a few years before taking it apart for restoration.

Mr Petch, now aged 70, planned to restore it to its former glory, but it remained in pieces for another 25 years.

It wasn't until he approached a motorcycle expert 11 years ago that the classic machine was restored.

His bike was the top-selling lot at the International Classic Motorcycle Show at the weekend.

It finally attracted the whopping closing bid at the Bonhams auction, held at the Staffordshire County Showground on Sunday.

Ben Walker, Head of the Bonhams Motorcycle Department, said: 'Once again, our auction at the International Classic proved to be exactly that, with interest from bidders from across the globe.'

Among other auction highlights was a 1914 Indian Model F once owned by legendary Hollywood actor Steve McQueen

Among other auction highlights was a 
1931 Brough Superior SS80 motorcycle - won in a raffle more than 40 
years ago, and a 1914 Indian Model F once owned by legendary Hollywood 
actor Steve McQueen.

The
 latter sold to a European telephone bidder for £32,200, while the SS80 
fetched £57,500 - more than a million times the cost of the 1972 raffle 
ticket.

Starting life 
as a sidecar outfit with Ipswich Police, the motorcycle was converted to
 solo trim and later offered as first prize in a fund-raising raffle at 
the Brough Superior Club.

Tickets were sold for five pence each, or 50p for a book of 10, and second and third prizes respectively were 10 and five gallons of oil.

An eclectic selection of 30 machines owned by the late Clifford Jones proved popular with bidders, selling for a total of more than £175,000.

The collection featured a number of 1950s 'cafe racers' - a favourite of Rockers in the early 1960 who would use them to travel from one transport cafe to another - as well as much modern-day racing and superbike machinery.

Meanwhile in the automobilia section, two Akai Yamaha race helmets worn by the legendary Barry Sheene in the 1980s fetched a combined total of £10,000.

Mr Walker added: 'Record-breaking machines like the 1952 Vincent Black Shadow and the movie star charisma of Steve McQueen were among the draws for the crowd, and there was fierce competition for the Ducatis in the collection of the late Clifford Jones.'
