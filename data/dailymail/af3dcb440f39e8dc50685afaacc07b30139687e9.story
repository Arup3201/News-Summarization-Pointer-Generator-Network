While initial reports claimed the man had shouted 'God is greatest' in Arabic before driving into the stand, local authorities dismissed suggestions it was terrorist-related. 

Up to 10 people 'went flying' when the car ploughed into the mulled wine stand, a police source said. 

Local prosecutor Brigitte Lamy said ther was no 'evidence of any religious motive'. 

The man, who stabbed himself after ploughing into pedestrians, is being treated at University Hospital in Nantes along with those run over.   

'His white van got into the Nantes market at around 7pm,' said a local police source.

'It was driven into a number of people before coming to a halt. Many were hit, with five requiring particular attention.' 

It comes after 13 people were injured in the city of Dijon on Sunday evening when a known psychiatric patient ploughed a Renault Clio into pedestrians while proclaiming 'God is greatest' in Arabic. 

The 40-year-old was arrested at the scene in Place du Wilson and taken into police custody where he remains. 

Last week security for police officers across France was 'stepped up' following a knife attack at a station in Joue-les-Tours.

Bertrand Nzohabonayo was shot dead after entering a police station in the central town with a knife, seriously wounding two officers, including slashing one in the face.

Nzohabonayo, who had posted an IS flagon his Facebook account, was a French national born in Burundi in 1994.

He was also heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' during the assault, as local prosecutor Jean-Luc Beck said investigators would seek to determine whether 'he acted alone or if he acted on orders.

'Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the scene of the attack on Saturday, saying he had ordered 'security measures to be stepped up' for all officers.

Nzohabonayo had previously committed petty criminal offences but was not on a domestic intelligence watch-list.

It is understood French authorities were monitoring the behaviour of his brother who had considered going to Syria. 

Authorities in France believe around1,200 French nationals are involved in jihadist networks in Iraq and Syria.
