In scenes now seared into the fabric of a nation, state troopers in helmets and gas masks stand off against crowds of young, black protesters on the roads between Selma and Montgomery, Alabama.

Seconds later they charge, tear gas flowing around them. Other frames show venerated leaders of the Civil Rights Movement marching implacably, despite the threat of harm to them and their supporters.

The images, now fifty years old, have been assembled from the work of three photographers covering the marches, and are now being displayed in a New York City photography exhibition.

Bloody Sunday: Alabama State Troopers are pictured above on March 7, 1965, confronting activists Hosea Williams, John Lewis and their supporters. Spider Martin, who took the photograph, observed they were 'beaten down like dominoes' in short order

Chaos: State troopers deployed tear gas against the marchers, drawing widespread outrage which contributed to the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year

Leaders: Martin Luther King Jr (center), James Forman (left)  and Reverend Jessie Douglas (right) are pictured above marching around the state capitol in Montgomery, Alabama

The first was Spider Martin, a staff photographer for the pro-segregation Birmingham News, who described dodging heavy-handed authorities, climbing rickety churches and scrapping with other journalists to get the best shots.

The pictures are being displayed by the Steven Kasher Gallery, which will display them until April 18.

Also featured is Charles Moore, who was working for Life Magazine, and whose images were seen around the world. Last was James Barker, a staff photographer employed by Washington State University and asked to attend the demonstrations.

Patriotic: A young man carries the Stars and Stripes over his shoulder, followed by several others doing the same on Bloody Sunday

The shots show the emotion, tension an violence of the struggles. In several, Alabama state troopers are poised to attack the protesters - which the photographers attest happened just seconds after they took their pictures.

High-quality images of the authorities' brutal response helped galvanize change and push through the Voting Rights Act just five months later.

However, the transmission of the images was far from guaranteed - Martin recalled how his editors initially tried to suppress his images.

Explaining their logic, he said: 'the largely segregationist editors thought if you didn't publish it, much of this would go away'. But, taking the lead of other news outlets, he images were released - and helped effect a profound change in the fabric of America.
