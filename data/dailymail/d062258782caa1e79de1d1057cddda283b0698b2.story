Prince William was treated to a royal command performance this evening as he watched England thrash Peru by three goals to nil.

The prince was in attendance at Wembley stadium to watch England sail through their World Cup warm-up against the South Americans, with goals from Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge, Chelsea's Gary Cahill and Everton captain Phil Jagielka.

There was a party atmosphere inside the stadium, with music, Mexican wave-style dancing, and games with paper aeroplanes keeping the guests amused before captain Steven Gerrard led the England team out for a win which looked far more convincing on paper than it did in actuality.

Daniel Sturridge curled home a stunning opener to put England ahead in their final game on home soil before the World Cup.

Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill then scored from two set-pieces after the break to give the result an encouraging appearance.

Yet it was clear from this performance that there is still much work to be done if England are to hit the ground running - as they must - when they land in Brazil to take on Italy in their Group D opener.

Wayne Rooney and Sturridge failed to hit it off as had been hoped, while Jean Deza, a 20-year-old debutant, breached the England defence on several occasions.

Had it not been for the excellent Joe Hart and some last-ditch defending from Jagielka, Peru would have scored the goal their attacking display perhaps deserved.Â

England manager Roy Hodgson said preparations for the friendly could not have gone better, but the tactical work England put in this week in Burton barely paid off in the first half.

Danny Welbeck, a surprise starter ahead of Raheem Sterling, failed to create a spark out wide while Rooney went missing for most of the match.

At some points England fans found more entertainment in making paper planes and throwing them on the pitch.

However, England will take some positives to Miami, where they will play Ecuador and Honduras in their final two warm-up games next week.

Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard performed solidly in midfield, as they did all last season for Liverpool.

Sturridge's fourth goal for England was a joy to behold, while Sterling and Jack Wilshere showed glimpses of skill after their introduction.

And, most importantly, there were no injuries.
