Southampton maintain they have 'no need to accept any offers' for their star players this summer, after England forward Rickie Lambert was allowed to leave for Liverpool.

Following the departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino to take up the Tottenham job, there has been mounting speculation the likes of World Cup duo Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw would follow the Argentine out of St Mary's Stadium.

However, the Barclays Premier League club on Monday issued a statement insisting there was not about to be a mass exodus, despite confirming a number of offers had been received, with the likes of Manchester United said to be trailing full-back Shaw and Liverpool determined to land midfield playmaker Lallana ahead of the World Cup finals.

Departure: Rickie Lambert has left Southampton for Liverpool and could be the first of many to exit

'Southampton Football Club can confirm
 that we have received multiple offers for some of our players in the 
past weeks.

'This is a confirmation of the depth of the development that 
is ongoing in our academy and of the present standing of our first team 
within the Premier League. We are staying true to our plan and vision 
and, as a result, we have no need to accept any offers." a 
statement on the club's official website read.

'We
 are deep in the process of appointing a new manager who will continue 
to move our club forward. It remains our preference not to partake in 
any transfers until the new manager is in place.

'Our
 scouting & recruitment department continues to monitor targets we 
have identified to improve our squad, and the new manager will have 
final input into our recruitment process.'

Saints paid tribute to Lambert, who helped the south coast club return to the top flight from League One.

The
 32-year-old, currently out in Miami with England's World Cup squad, 
underwent a medical on Saturday after a fee of Â£4million was agreed. 
Lambert is understood to have signed a two-year deal with the club who 
released him as a 15-year-old.

'There
 may be circumstances under which the club will feel it is right for a 
player to move on. Those circumstances have to be right for the club and
 the player. This is the case with Rickie's move to Liverpool," 
Southampton's statement continued.

'When
 Rickie Lambert requested to leave for Liverpool, the club felt it could
 not stand in the way of having him fulfil his boyhood dream of playing 
at home.

'It will be a big 
challenge to replace him and our intention is to source a quality 
replacement who will fill his shoes now, but also for many years to 
come.'

Chairman Ralph 
Krueger added: 'On behalf of the club, I would like to thank Rickie. He 
served with distinction and helped to take Saints from League 1 to the 
Premier League.

'Rickie has 
been a shining light in Saints' growth and will forever remain an icon 
in the history of the club. He leaves with the best wishes of everyone 
at Southampton and will always be welcome back at St Mary's.'

Last
 week, Krueger claimed Southampton had been inundated with calls from 
some of the 'highest quality managers in Europe' and that the club are 
in their best ever position despite Pochettino's exit, having finished 
eighth last season.

Former 
FC Basel coach Murat Yakin and Dutchman Ronald Koeman are the current 
bookmakers' favourites to take the St Mary's hotseat, while former 
Swansea manager Michael Laudrup is also said to be in the running.
