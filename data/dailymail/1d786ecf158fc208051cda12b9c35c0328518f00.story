Released: Steven Powell, 63, has been released from prison following a 2-year sentence

Steven Powell, the father-in-law of missing Utah woman Susan Powell, has been released from prison after serving more than two years for voyeurism charges.

Powell, 63, left the Tacoma, Washington prison on Sunday after serving 30 months for taking photographs of two girls, aged 8 and 10, from his house while they were in their bathroom in a neighboring home.

His release comes amid claims that he has information about his missing daughter-in-law, who vanished in 2009 and whom relatives believe was killed by her husband, Josh Powell.

But Josh Powell never faced charges in the case and in 2012, he tried to murder his sons, Charles, 7, and Braden, 5, with a hatchet before setting alight to the home, killing them and himself.

Steven Powell's estranged daughter, 
Jennifer Graves, said she believes her father has information about 
Susan's disappearance. She told KSL she was not happy about his release.

'I
 knew it was coming and that it was going to be today,' Graves said.

'It had to come, so I’m not particularly 
pleased about it, but it had to come,' Graves said. 'He shows no remorse, no intention 
of changing his ways and improving himself.'

Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her two sons, vanished in 2009 and relatives and investigators believed she was killed by her husband, but he was never charged in the case

She added: 'I 
don’t really want him back in my life at this point because I think he 
was responsible, or at least knows about Susan’s disappearance.'

Powell will be on probation for 30 months, required to wear a GPS locator and attend a sex-offender treatment program, KSL reported. He plans to live in Tacoma, according to the corrections facility.

Deseret News reported that the two girls victimized by Powell were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit.

After
 that December ruling, the judge ordered the Pierce County Sheriff's 
Office to sell off the home since it is Powell's largest non-exempt 
asset - a ruling he has been fighting.

Obsessed: Relatives have also said they think Steven Powell, pictured, has information about Susan's disappearance. His journal entries revealed that he was obsessed with her

Steven Powell's exploits gained national attention after his son Josh killed his own two sons in 2012. Until then, Josh Powell had been the focus of the investigation into his missing wife, Susan.

Susan Powell disappeared from her home in December 2009 and her body has never been found.

He had a sexual obsession with Susan Powell that was thoroughly documented in journals seized by police.

In passages from 17 spiral notebooks written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes they would be together.

He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem of her being married to my son. The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.'

He admitted 'looking at her naked body under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a 'sick' thing to do.

But there is no hint that he or his son Josh had anything to do with her disappearance and he made mention of the possibility she ran off with another man - which is what Josh Powell told police.

Following her disappearance, authorities found blood in the family home and a hand-written note in which Susan Powell expressed fear about her husband hurting her.
