The sight of a blue-clad No 8 breaking late into the box to finish off a flowing move is a familiar one at Stamford Bridge – but on Saturday things were a little different.

A week on from when Frank Lampard showed his former employers what they were missing  at the Etihad, Brazilian midfielder Oscar is going some way to making up for his absence.

The 23-year-old is still far from the finished product, as shown by Jose Mourinho’s decision to drop him in that title clash with Manchester City, but  in his showings against Bolton and Aston Villa he is starting to demonstrate the performance levels that his manager demands.

Chelsea legend Lampard was never frightened to go for goal from range – but Oscar has actually scored more from outside the box in his first 25 goals for the Blues.

Against Villa he drove a midfield that contained the quality of Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic – and outshone them all with an opening goal typical of the man whose shirt number he has taken on.

Oscar rarely tops the charts in terms of the ground he covers (5.6 miles compared with Fabregas’ 7.4 this weekend) or his pace (his top speed of 16.8mph was lower even than John Terry’s 19.3) – but what he is is effective – and with Diego Costa leading the line he now gets the room he needs to pull the strings in that No 10 position.

'I played him (Oscar) again because I think he needs the confidence that comes with matches,’ Mourinho said after the 3-0 win.

‘His performance was good; he was in important areas of our game, the connection between him, Matic and Fabregas was good, the connection between him and the attacking players was good.’

In a combination of the No 10 role under Mourinho and from wide under Roberto Di Matteo and Rafael Benitez, Oscar has produced 25 goals and 23 assists in just over two seasons for the Blues.

Lampard only had 17 goals in the same time period when he began his Chelsea career – and he was three years Oscar’s senior.

Of the Brazilian's first 25 goals for the Blues, eight have come from outside the penalty box 

Lampard became a Chelsea legend at Stamford Bridge and is the club's record goalscorer with 211

While no-one is suggesting he will reach the same heights as Chelsea’s all-time greatest player, the numbers are still impressive for a player many thought had switched off with a focus on the World Cup towards the end of last season.

Blues assistant Steve Holland spoke post-match about the importance of a Chelsea No 10 being a ‘goalscorer’ as well as a creator – and with two goals in a week Oscar is going some way towards that.

With countryman Ramires out of the side through injury he needs to prove to Mourinho he has the temperament to impact on big games – and that starts on Tuesday night against Sporting Lisbon and in even more so in Sunday’s London derby against Arsenal.
