WhatsApp has overtaken traditional mobile phone texts for the first time as users send 30 billion messages every.

The app allows people to send instant messages and photographs via the internet rather without incurring charges from their network provider.

Its growing popularity saw people send 30 billion WhatsApp messages a day last year, compared to 20 billion SMS text messages, according to research by The Economist.

WhatsApp has overtaken traditional mobile phone texts for the first time as users sent 30 billion messages every day

Messaging apps have exploded in popularity over the last few years thanks to the growth of smartphones and 3G and 4G allowing fast internet connection.

But the move is predicted to hit telecoms firms hard.

Research company Ovum found that the decline in the use of traditional text messages in favour of messaging apps was estimated to cost mobile network providers $54billion by 2016.

WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and claims it is currently registering one million new users a day

Last month, WhatsApp, which was only founded in 2009, was bought by Facebook for $19 billion- the most ever paid for a venture-capital-backed company. It was the social networking giant's biggest acquisition to date. 

In a statement announcing the deal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described WhatsApp's services as 'incredibly valuable'.

WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and claims it is currently registering one million new users a day.

It makes money by charging users a subscription fee of $1 per year, although it offers a free model as well.
