A 24-year-old male supermarket worker is preparing for a legal battle to become Britain's first single surrogate parent.

Kyle Casson, from Doncaster, who is gay, says he has been thinking about having a child for a few years, but only now does he feel 'mature and financially stable enough' to do so.

He wants to do it in his twenties, rather than wait for a partner, who may not come along.

And, determined to achieve his ambition, he is going to take on the legal system and fight to legally adopt his own baby.

Speaking on ITV's Daybreak on Monday, he said he had wanted a child for a while but now feels mature and financially stable enough to have one

Surrogacy is when a woman gives birth to a baby for - usually - a couple, who want to have a child.

The eggs and sperm of the intended parents can be used or they can be donor eggs and/or donor sperm.

While it is not illegal for single parents to enter into a surrogacy arrangement, the law currently prevents them applying for a parental order that they need to be able to raise their child in the UK.

Natalie Gamble, from Natalie Gamble Associates, UK's leading experts in UK and international surrogacy law, told MailOnline that it was more difficult for a single woman to become a parent through surrogacy in the UK.

Here she explains the law:

'It is more difficult for
 a single women because they won't have the same connection with the 
baby, whereas the man would be the biological father.

'There is nothing in the law in the UK that makes it illegal to enter into a surrogacy arrangement as a single parent.

'But it doesn’t make it easy 
either. Most parents through surrogacy (including gay dads and unmarried
 couples) can apply for a ‘parental order’ after their child is born.

'This is an order made by the family
 court which gives the intended parents a new birth certificate and 
extinguishes the responsibilities of the surrogate mother.

'Single parents are not, however, eligible to apply.

'This means it is perfectly legal 
for a man like Kyle to have a child through surrogacy in the UK, but the
 normal solution for families created through surrogacy (designed to 
give lifelong security and certainty for the child) is not available.

'He will have to get creative with 
using law designed for other purposes to secure his family and resolve 
the position of his surrogate – adoption being the best alternative to a
 parental order if the family court will agree to help.'

The law was extended, in 2008, to allow gay fathers and unmarried couples to apply for surrogacy.

Currently no single man or woman in 
Britain has been able to become a parent with the help of a donor egg 
and a British surrogate.

Some single men are believed to have travelled abroad to America or India where they have been able to father a child through surrogacy.

But in Britain the law only allows two parents to apply for a parental order for any surrogate child born this way. The law doesn’t allow a single parent to do the same thing.

Even though Kyle’s sperm will be used to fertilise the donor egg and a surrogate mother will carry the child to full-term, legally, he will still have no rights over the child even when it’s born.

Instead he’ll have to try and adopt his own baby to get full custody - something else which has never been done before.

Kyle has already found a British surrogate willing to carry the baby and a fertility clinic willing to help him with an egg donor but who will remain anonymous.

His legal case cannot begin until the child is born.

Kyle, a supermarket worker from Skellow, Doncaster said: 'The only thing I’ll be told about her is her physical features such as height, hair and eye colour but I plan to choose someone with features as close to mine as I can get.

'I’ve been thinking about it for a few years but it’s only recently that I feel I’m mature and financially stable enough to have a child.

'I own my own house, I’ve got a good job and a great family and friends supporting me.'

Kyle admits that his plan is a big gamble with no guarantee that he’d be allowed to legally adopt his own baby.

He said : 'I'm openly gay but I'm not in a relationship and I don't want to wait until I'm in a serious relationship to have a baby. 

'Everything is in place to go ahead. I
 have a close member of the family who will act as the surrogate mother I
 just have to find an egg donor.

'After that I can legally take 
custody when the child is born but then I want to legally adopt the 
baby. I know it cost me thousands in legal fees but I have the money to 
finance it and I'm determined to go through with this.

'It’s never been done before. My lawyer 
couldn’t tell me and still can’t say what will or might happen because 
this has never been tried before. But to me it’s worth the risk.

'My lawyer says the case would initially
 be heard in Doncaster but if I wasn’t allowed to adopt the case could 
end up in the High Court but I’m willing to fight this all the way.

'I just hope that by doing this that 
I’ll be able to help other single people wanting to become a parent 
using a British surrogate.'

Kyle says as the law stands would-be single parents are routinely discriminated against when it comes to using a British surrogate mother.

Kyle could take his case as far as the High Court in a landmark legal battle to gain full rights of a child born through surrogacy

Kyle was just four years old when his own mother Anne-Marie, separated from his biological father.

He said : 'My twin brothers were only nine-months-old so mum was single parent to three children all under the age of five.'

Anne-Marie later went on to marry Kyle’s dad Alan Casson, 43, who adopted all three boys and raised them as his own.

'My mum was a single parent before she met my dad so who’s to say I won't meet someone in the future,' he added.

Kyle has discussed the plan with his family and added : 'I’ve got an amazing family - everyone’s behind me.

'No one has said a negative word about it because they know how much I want this. I’ve really thought about it for such a long time.

'I’ve gone over every last detail time and time again - I’ve not taken this decision lightly.'

Natalie Gamble, Kyle's solicitor and an expert in surrogacy law, said Kyle's legal case cannot being until a 
surrogate child has been born.

She said: 'It is only then that the 
legal process can begin to challenge the provisions of a parental order.
 It is not illegal but the fact that there is no provision in the law 
for a single person to apply for a parental order.

'It is difficult to assess what a legal challenge would cost but there is no provision for legal aid in this sort of case.'We frequently see heartbreaking cases caused by the denial of surrogacy to single parents.

'A change to the law would benefit not only prospective solo dads like Kyle, but also single women who have survived cancer and need the help of a surrogate to carry their child, and widowed fathers who want to use embryos in storage, just as widowed mothers are able to do.'
