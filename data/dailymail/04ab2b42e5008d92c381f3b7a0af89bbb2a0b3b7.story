A blogger whose reflections on terminal bone cancer inspired countless followers has lost her battle against the disease.

Three weeks ago MailOnline ran extracts from charity worker
Louise Page's blog about her experience of having cancer.

Her moving and surprisingly humorous take on her bleak
prognosis triggered an outpouring of emotion from readers.

Some blog followers even claimed to have made major
life-changing decisions - such as moving across the country to be closer to
family or changing career – after reading her inspiring words.

But sadly Louise died last Sunday and her husband Alan Ainsley announced his loss by simply updating her blog with the words: 'My darling, beautiful wife and best friend 15.12.70 - 19.05.13xxxxxxxx'

Louise Page died on Sunday 19 May after a ten-year battle with a rare bone cancer. Her husband Alan announced his loss on her blog by simply posting the above image and writing: 'My darling, beautiful wife and best friend 15.12.70 - 19.05.13xxxxxxxx'

Photographer Rankin has also paid tribute to Louise on Facebook. He met her after she took part in one of his latest projects entitled 'Alive'.

'Alive: In the face of Death' is an exhibition looking at the reality of death from all perspectives – from people who work in the death industry to those, like Louise, living with a terminal illness. The show opened at the Walker Gallery in Liverpool earlier this week.

Rankin wrote: ‘I am very sad to say that Lou Page passed away peacefully yesterday morning. She was a shining light … I can't even begin to express my love and admiration for her.

'It is rare that one subject has so much influence on you, but for me, Louise really did make a massive difference. Her infectious love for life reminded us all to live our own lives to the fullest. 

It was husband Alan Ainsley that suggested Louise Page start writing about her feelings about her terminal cancer diagnosis. She has had well-wishing messages from readers as far away New Zealand

'To cherish our own mortality and not be selfish or preoccupied with it. She was plain and direct about her feelings and taught me to focus on the good things and not dwell on the negatives of the day-to-day, or my own self obsessions. 

'Talking to her made it so much easier to come to terms with the passing of my own parents.

'Her "after crying" image is one of my favourite photos ever. I'm so proud to have helped her to create it.

Rankin's image of Louise for charity project Alive is powerful and the photographer said it is one of his favourite photographs ever

'An all round lovely human being, which the world should have known for longer. It is with deep sadness that we all say goodbye to her. The word 'loss' is just not enough.

'To Al, Lou's best friend and the love of her life, I know she'll be there forever. All my love to you both. It was an honour to meet her and I'll remember her forever. Lots of love Rankin x’

Louise, 42, from Edinburgh was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in December 2012, just two weeks after her two-year wedding anniversary.

She had been fighting a rare form of bone cancer called Dedifferentiated Adamantinoma in her left leg since 2004.

Louise had a farewell party for her left leg (left) before it was amputated four years ago. She has documented much of her experience with photos, such as just before her leg was removed. The black arrow drawn on her leg indicates where surgeons should cut (right)

The cancer behaved very oddly and returned each time doctors tried to remove it, so in 2008 they were forced to amputate part of her leg.

She
underwent repeated cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 
conjunction with the surgery but doctors had to amputate a further three
times to stem the growth of the cancer.

But just weeks after her two-year 
wedding anniversary with her husband, the couple were given 
the devastating news that she only had weeks to live. The cancer had spread to 
her lungs, next to her liver and where her ribs and shoulder blade meet.

'We both kind of knew it would happen
eventually but for a couple of weeks were in a bit of shock,' said Mr 
Ainsley. 'Eventually, we pulled together and just decided to
stay positive. Louise has been positive about her situation from the 
outset.'

Alan, 45, suggested she start writing about her experiences as a means to cope with the emotions she was experiencing.

Her musings and reflections on her life - past, present and future - culminated in her blog Lou's Story, which quickly developed a worldwide following. She has had well-wishing messages from readers as far away as Nepal, New Zealand and Russia.

'One person even got in touch to say 
they'd left their job after reading Louise's blog - they decided that 
life was too short not to do something that made them happy and changed 
career to be closer their family,' said Alan.

Here, with Louise's husband's permission, MailOnline features Louise' last blog entry.

MAY - SAYING GOODBYE

Goodbye (or its many
variations) is a word we say all the time. 

When our partner leaves for work, when you leave the office
for the day.

Louise's health deteriorated but she tried to look on the bright side, saying she 'no longer needed to worry about a pension and now had more time to watch trashy daytime television'

Louise was keen to live as normally as possible despite her need for daily palliative treatment

When it’s time to leave the pub after perhaps one too many…

But it’s only when it’s a harder goodbye that we really
think about what we’re saying. 

Dropping someone you love off at the airport knowing you
won’t see them again for months. 

That
type of goodbye hits hard.  But you do
have the hope and belief that you will see that person again.

But goodbye has changed for me lately….

I still have all the daily ‘Bye, see you later’ goodbyes for
my friends and family.

But then, there are the much harder goodbyes, where I know I
won’t see that person again in this life. 

And over the last weeks I’ve had to get through a few of
those goodbyes as my friends from overseas have visited me (you know who you
are and I love you).

And it’s so painful and so hard and heart-crushingly awful
and feels so unfair. 

I’m there hugging someone and not wanting to ever let
go.  But I have to. 

And then they disappear around the side of our house and
that’s it.  And there’s no solution other
than to sob.  And then try and console
myself with the existence of Facetime and Skype.

Tender moment: Louise and Alan hold hands. She said her disease made her treasure those close to her

It all makes me wonder if we should consider our goodbyes
more carefully, treat them more seriously. 

I used to have this silly superstition that I could never
let someone go or say ‘bye to them if there was some kind of negative feeling
in the air (we’ve all slammed doors after an argument, or hung up on people
we’re angry with). 

Louise said that by getting on with daily life - such as going out for lunch - she was able to forget about her bleak prognosis

I’m not a paranoid or superstitious person at all normally,
but I hated the idea of that being our last goodbye somehow. 

So maybe that was my preparation for my current
situation.  Who knows?  But I reckon it’s worth thinking about what
bye means to us all and seeing what we discover.

Anyhow, after thinking about what it means to me, I’ve
decided I prefer the French “au revoir” as with that there is hope that I shall
see my loved ones again. 

Maybe not in this life, but, if I’m lucky, in the next.  I can but hope.
