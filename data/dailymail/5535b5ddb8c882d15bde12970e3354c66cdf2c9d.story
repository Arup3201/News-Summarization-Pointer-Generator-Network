Thousands: In an announcement at the Liberian capitol of Monrovia, Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said thousands of soldiers were arriving as he spoke

Though the Ebola virus has reached the United States, thousands of Americans are taking the fight overseas to Africa in a mission called 'Operation United Assistance.'

The mission to combat the deadly virus is stationed in Liberia where other agencies are currently battling the outbreak.

This Ebola unit is mainly made up of U.S. troops but also includes doctors, nurses, scientists, aviators, engineers, mechanics, and technicians, most of whom are volunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service, the Washington Post reports.

Many have left their families behind to be a part of the now global effort to fight the outbreak which has claimed the lives of almost 5,000 in eight affected or previously affected countries including the United States, according to a WHO report updated Saturday. 

More than 10,000 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of the virus have been reported in the eight countries.

In an announcement made Saturday from Liberia's capitol of Monrovia, Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said soldiers were arriving as he spoke.

'Thousands of my soldiers are arriving right now,' Volesky said, 'and they are as excited as I am, and ready to join this great team that you all have built so together we can stamp out Ebola.'

The overall mission is the effort of the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Operation United Assistance: Thousands of U.S. soldiers and civilians are headed to Africa to fight Ebola in 'Operation United Assistance,' the U.S.'s latest effort to combat the virus

When the mission was initially announced in early September, The USDOD officials described the mission's main goals: set up a joint force command headquarters in Libreria to support military activities and help coordinate aid from other agencies, appoint a General Officer in Monrovia, provide engineers to build Ebola Treatment Units, and establish a training site for health care providers to direct care to Ebola patients. 

The Post reports that health official's plan for the mission include building 17 Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in Liberia staffed by health-care workers, each with 100 beds.

This is to remove Ebola victims from their home, where they can easily spread the virus, and treat them at the ETUs where the risk of spread is limited and the patients can get the appropriate care.

The ETUs will reportedly not be completed until December. The first is expected to be built within weeks.

Pentagon officials have reportedly stressed that U.S. military personnel will not directly treat Ebola patients or come in contact with them.  

The 17 ETUs will in turn provide 1,700 beds to Ebola patients, but a report in the infectious diseases section of The Lancet medical journal, says that's not enough. 

The report stated that the number of beds needed to effectively control the outbreak in Montserrado County -- where Monrovia is located -- substantially exceeds the number global officials intend to have in the ETUs.

The journal based its findings on a  mathematical analysis of the outbreak and the report states that the 'findings highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak and averting a catastrophic toll of EVD cases and deaths.'

Nations: Though this mission has the U.S. military deploying primarily to Liberia, other American civilian operations are taking place in Guinea, Sierra Leone and other West African nations

Despite the journal's criticism, the mission is in full swing. The USAID is allowing health-care workers to sign up to volunteer to be a part of the mission on its website.

The post reports that more than 3,000 people have volunteered online to serve in West Africa. However, those who signed up to volunteer have to undergo and make it through a screening process.

Volunteers have been offered top-flight medical treatment in case they get sick, according to the Post, and a field-hospital near Monrovia's airport is expected to open in the beginning of November. 

The looming risk of contracting the virus is not the only difficulty presented by the mission. Also at hand is the area's harsh roads as well as mosquitos and malaria.

Also the potential New York, New Jersey, and Illinois 21-day quarantine for travelers from West Africa who have dealt with Ebola patients may be an impediment to potential volunteers.   

Though this mission has the U.S. military deploying primarily to Liberia, other American civilian operations are taking place in Guinea, Sierra Leone and other West African nations. 

Hundreds of American civilians have been in West Africa for months fighting the deadly virus.
