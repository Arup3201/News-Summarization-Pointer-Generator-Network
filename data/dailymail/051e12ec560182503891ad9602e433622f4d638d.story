Sir Alex Ferguson has shown there is no animosity between him and former managerial rival Jose Mourinho by heaping praise on him during a revealing interview.

Former Manchester United manager Ferguson, speaking to BT Sport on a show to be aired on Boxing Day, labelled his counterpart as 'good looking' and complimented his impressive trophy cabinet. 

'It is unfair really. He’s good looking, he’s got that sort of George Clooney bit in his hair now,' Ferguson commented. 'But I think he is a great example, he can speak five languages or whatever he can.

'He goes and becomes an interpreter for Bobby Robson, follows him to Barcelona, works under Louis Van Gaal; he is learning all the time.' 

Mourinho and Ferguson were embroiled in many a battle during their time at Chelsea and Manchester United respectively, but Ferguson appears to have calmed down in his retirement. 

'He (Mourinho) has got a determination, he wants to be a coach,' Ferguson added. 'He never played the game, by the way – you tell me how many presidents would give a manager a job who has never played the game? None. But he has done it.

'Then he goes and manages a small team in Portugal, then goes to Porto and wins the league, wins the UEFA Cup, wins the European Cup, goes to Chelsea and wins the league. Goes to Inter Milan. 

'That is an example to anyone who wants to do well, you shouldn’t let the barriers get in your way if you want to get there.'

Mourinho's Chelsea side have had an almost faultless start to the Premier League campaign, only losing one game in their first 17.
