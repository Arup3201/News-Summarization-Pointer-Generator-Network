The astronaut who became an internet sensation after covering one of David Bowie’s most popular songs has received the ultimate accolade – after the singer himself praised it as ‘so beautiful’.

Chris Hadfield’s version of Space Oddity – which was recorded 220 miles above Earth on the International Space Station – has racked up 13.3 million hits since it was posted on YouTube a week ago, nearly double the 7.3 million views for Bowie’s original.

The Canadian filmed himself singing and  playing guitar as a farewell message to his one million Twitter fans as he prepared to return home last Tuesday after five months in space.

And like the ISS, a partnership between
 15 nations, the version was an international collaboration.

After 
completing it using his iPad, Commander Hadfield sent the recording to 
singer-songwriter Emm Gryner, who added her own piano part in Ontario.

The video was then edited by the astronaut’s son Evan, 27, in Germany, 
before being passed to the Canadian Space Agency, which released it on 
YouTube. Miss Gryner, who was  in Bowie’s live band in 1999 and 2000, 
said: ‘David emailed afterwards, saying, “It’s all so beautiful.” ’

It's believed to be the first music video made in space, according to NASA. 

'With deference to the genius of David 
Bowie, here's Space Oddity, recorded on Station. A last glimpse of the 
World,' Hadfield said via Twitter.

Commander Hadfield has gained a huge following since blasting into space
 in December. His stunning photographs of Earth, prolific tweets, and 
numerous videos explaining how to eat and wash in zero gravity have been
 viewed more than 23 million times.

Hadfield landed safely back on 
Earth on Friday with two other astronauts after a five-month mission - and 
immediately tweeted it was 'wonderful to smell and feel Spring.'

The capsule touched down exactly as planned, and rescue crews were soon on site to help the astronauts emerge 

A Soyuz space capsule carrying the Canadian astronaut, American Thomas Marshburn, and Russian Roman Romanenko landed as planned
 in the Steppes of Kazakhstan on Friday.

Live footage on NASA TV showed the Soyuz TMA-07M capsule slowly descending by parachute onto the steppes under clear skies.

The three astronauts smiled as they chatted with space agency officials and doctors who were checking their condition.

Hadfield, who served as the space station's commander, gave a thumbs-up sign. They then made quick phone calls to family members and friends.

NASA spokesman Josh Byerly said by telephone from the landing site that the three returning astronauts were doing very well.

Hadfield, 53, an engineer and former 
test pilot from Milton, Ontario, was Canada's first professional 
astronaut to live aboard the space station and became the first Canadian
 in charge of a spacecraft. He relinquished command of the space station
 on Sunday.

'It's just been an extremely fulfilling and amazing experience end to end,' Hadfield told Mission Control on Monday. 'From this Canadian to all the rest of them, I offer an enormous debt of thanks.'

He was referring to all those in the Canadian Space Agency who helped make his flight possible.

Superstar: Chris Hadfield has developed millions of adoring fans for the YouTube videos that he has posted in his five months as commander of the International Space Station

Hadfield's most recent hit was his cover of David Bowie's 'Space Oddity'

Hadfield sang often in orbit, using a guitar already aboard the complex, and even took part in a live, Canadian coast-to-coast concert in February that included the Barenaked Ladies' Ed Robertson and a youth choir.

The five-minute video posted Sunday drew a salute from Bowie's official Facebook page: 'It's possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created.'

A three-man U.S and Russian crew is staying on the space station and will be joined in two weeks by the next trio of astronauts.
