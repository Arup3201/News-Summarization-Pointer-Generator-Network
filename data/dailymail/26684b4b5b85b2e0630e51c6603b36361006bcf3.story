A baker who was pressured into quickly drinking a lethal amount of absinthe at a party died ten minutes after paramedics refused to take him to hospital for being too drunk, an inquest heard.

Ambulance technician Ian Wilson put baker Jason Dance, 33, into the recovery position before leaving the house party in Allenton, Derbyshire, because he felt ‘claustrophobic and intimidated’.

Mr Wilson admitted to his manager he had ‘messed up’ over his treatment of Mr Dance, who had downed a quarter of a pint of the spirit to prove he couldn't be 'drunk under the table' by peers.

Death: Jason Dance, of Allenton, Derbyshire, had downed a quarter of a pint of absinthe to prove he couldn't be 'drunk under the table' by peers, before he died in August 2010

The deadly dose of the drink, which is often up to 80 per cent alcohol, left him severely intoxicated - and minutes later he stood up and collapsed in the kitchen, smacking his head on the way down.

An inquest into his death at South Derbyshire Coroner's Court heard that emergency services were called to the scene, but they refused to administer life-saving treatment because he was too drunk.

Witness Tanya Brown said: ‘We were sat 
around and someone said to Jason that they could drink him under the 
table. A quarter of a glass of absinthe was poured for him.

‘Jason was saying “no” but everyone was egging him on to do it. He said he would have it, then he was going home, and he necked it.’

She added that he got up to go to the kitchen but fell over before projectile vomiting on the night in August 2010, adding: ‘The paramedics said they wouldn't take him because he was too drunk.’

Party-goers were told to leave him on the decking at the back of the property to sleep it off, Miss Brown said. He snored for a few minutes then she noticed that his lips and ears were turning blue.

She
said: ‘People thought it was just the light but then they checked his 
pulse and there wasn't one.’ She added that a party-goer tried to 
administer heart massage and the ambulance was called again.

When questioned as to whether Mr 
Wilson and his colleague Louise Stanley were asked to leave at any 
point, Miss Brown said 'nobody asked them to leave the first time'.

Peter
Bainbridge, clinical quality manager for East Midlands Ambulance 
Service, was asked by coroner Dr Robert Hunter whether Mr Dance had 
received the 'minimum standard' of care.

Mr Bainbridge said: ‘This patient should have been taken to hospital. He was in a vulnerable situation.’

Dr Hunter was told how the duo put Mr Dance into the recovery position and left him with friends.

But less than 10 minutes later a second 
999 call was made after Mr Dance had stopped breathing and had turned 
blue. By the time the ambulance team arrived back at the house he was 
dead.

Giving evidence on the first day of the inquest on Monday, paramedic team leader Louisa Allcock told the court how she had been called to the house about an hour after the death.

She said: ‘When I arrived, Ian was standing against a wall.

'A policeman asked me if it was common procedure to attend to a patient that was not feeling coherent and then to leave them with their friends. I said no, it was not normal procedure at all.’

Home Office pathologist Professor Guy Ruttey, determined that the amount of alcohol found in Mr Dance’s system - which was 10 times the legal drink drive limit - 'would be enough to kill him'.

Partygoer Jonathan Croft also told the coroner the atmosphere was not intimidating at the event. The inquest continues.
