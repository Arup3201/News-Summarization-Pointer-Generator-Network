The under-fire editor of Newsnight acknowledged his 'boring snoring' Twitter blunder last night by having #fail written next to his name on the show's closing credits.

Ian Katz was forced to issue a series of humbling public apologies after he slurred Labour's senior frontbencher Rachel Reeves to 26,000 followers after an interview on Monday night.

At the end of the first Newsnight since the error, Mr Katz, who is only in his second week in the job, decided to run #fail next to his Twitter handle @iankatz1000.

The hashtag is often used online to describe a mistake of epic proportions.

Says it all: After a tough day and a series of apologies, Newsnight editor Ian Katz admitted his 'boring snoring' Twitter blunder was an epic #fail

Poor show: Ian Katz thought he was sending a private direct message on Twitter but it went to his followers and came to the attention of Ms Reeves

Apology: The editor, who came from the Guardian after the Savile scandal rocked the show, was forced to apologise for another blunder linked to Newsnight

Yesterday furious Labour party officials vowed to boycott the programme in 
protest warned the Opposition's 'confidence in the impartiality and 
fairness' in the BBC had been undermined.

The former Guardian deputy editor had 
thought that his post was a private message but ended up tweeting it to 
his more than 26,000 followers.

Apology: Mr Katz has now written to Labour to say sorry for the 'personal offence' caused but he maintained that Newsnight is impartial

The message, which was subsequently deleted, appears to have been meant in reply to a comment about the programme.

Mr Katz tweeted: 'Tnks ... except for 
boring snoring rachel reeves ... playout was fun tho, wasn't it? telly 
MUCH netter (sic) than snooooozepapers innit.'

The post prompted an apparently sarcastic reply from shadow treasury chief secretary Ms Reeves, who simply said 'thanks...'.

As shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Miss Reeves is effectively deputy to shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher wrote on Twitter: 'Good luck in future to @BBCNewsnight in trying to persuade Labour people to go on their frankly rather boring programme at 11 at night ...

'And whilst I'm at it ... I'm not sure a guy who worked for the Guardian (yawn) & now Newsnight (snooze) can lecture people about being boring.'

Former cabinet minister John Denham added: 'Ian Katz helped me answer whether I wanted to go from Southampton to Glasgow to appear on Newsnight.'

Last night Mr Katz quickly apologised for the 'ill-judged' comment, which he said was supposed to have been a direct message to one individual Twitter user.

He said: 'Accidentally sent v ill-judged tweet referring to @RachelReevesMP's appearance on NN.

'Thought was DM but in any circs wrong. Have apologised.'

Gaffe: Newsnight editor Ian Katz has said sorry online but Miss Reeves is said to be upset after the 'boring' jibe

As the storm over his tweet intensified this morning, at lunchtime he wrote to Labour's top spin doctor Bob Roberts and apologised again, this time 'unreservedly'.

'As you know it was intended as a private message but as you rightly say that is no excuse,' he said.

'I don't accept your implication that my tweet reflects in any way on the impartiality or fairness of Newsnight, except to the extent it reflects a determination make Newsnight as interesting as I can'.

He went on: 'I particularly regret any personal offence I have caused to Rachel and hope she will come on again soon'.

However, the Labour party made clear it was not going to let the matter rest.

The party today sent an email to Mr Katz demanding a full public apology for the 'completely unacceptable' comment.

The message said: 'We would like to express our anger and disappointment at your tweet following Newsnight's interview with Rachel Reeves.

'It is completely unacceptable for a senior BBC editor to have expressed this view, whether or not you intended for it to be made public.

'It is vitally important that the Labour Party, our shadow cabinet and Newsnight viewers have confidence in the impartiality and fairness of your programme, and the criteria on which guests and interviews are judged.

'This incident undermines that confidence and it is important that this is redressed. Although a tweet of apology has been made, a full written public apology should be made by the end of the day.'

Argument: Ms Reeves was grilled by Jeremy Paxman on Labour's links to the unions and zero hours contracts

Row: Labour's vice-chairman Michael Dugher condemned the gaffe and ridiculed Newsnight as 'boring'

Mr Katz replaced Peter Rippon who left the programme in the wake of the Jimmy Savile crisis.

He
 joined the Guardian in 1990 and has worked as a reporter, foreign 
correspondent, features editor and editor of the Saturday Guardian.

His appointment at the BBC reportedly raised eyebrows within the industry due to his lack of television experience.

Ms Reeves was appearing on the show to explain Labour's 'zero hours' policy.Â
