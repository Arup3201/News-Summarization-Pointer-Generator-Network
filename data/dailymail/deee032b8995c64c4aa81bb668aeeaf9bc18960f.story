Kitty Hope and Mark Greenwood have been making traditional British treats with a twist - think Sicilian lemon curd coconut ice, candy floss boiled sweets and chilli and ginger ticklers - for eight years and now the pair are set to teach the British public to do the same via their first TV show.

The couple already have two renowned sweet shops in London, several more in Japan, run a busy mail-order website and sell their sweets in supermarkets, department stores and smart delicatessens.

The couple from London are now set to realise their other big dream: to demystify sweet-making and get all of us whipping up gingerbread latte fudge in our homes.

Kitty and Mark - world famous London confectioners - launch their first show, Sweets Made Simple

The new four-part series, called Sweets Made Simple, is tipped to be the biggest since the Great British Bake Off.

Starting on Friday on BBC Two, the show sees the fun-loving couple put on the rubber gloves, pull out the heavy-bottomed pans and strain, squeeze, shape and lovingly craft their confections - showing you just how it's done, step-by-step.

Their passion for sweets is infectious - and they are pretty keen on each other too. 

'We met 20 years ago at a friend's dinner party, there was Boursin and a hostess trolley, and that was that,' says Kitty.

'Two decades later and we have two award-winning shops in London, lots of shops all over Japan, four recipe books and a TV series with the biggest broadcaster in the country. We're still getting our heads around it.'

'As a child who grew up in the north east of England. Sunday rituals included popping to the local sweet shop for Sarsaparilla's sweets, a Pink Panther bar and Twinkle Magazine.

'It's safe to say, I most definitely had a sweet tooth.'

Despite being a keen cook since she was 18, Kitty led a very different life before setting up Hope & Greenwood with Mark.

'I worked as a creative manager for a design agency and Mr. G was an 18th century chimney piece specialist,' she says.

'I love being in the kitchen, nothing 
excites me more than combining new flavours and tracking down new 
ingredients, and confectionery was a part of that curiosity from a young 
age.

'I had the idea to set up a sweet shop 
ten years ago. Mark and I swapped our flash company cars and sensible salaries for a life without holidays.

'On our first day of opening our first shop, the till didn't work; we spent the first week trading out of a Quality Street tin. It's hard to believe that ten years later, we are about to have our very own TV show.'

In the show, the couple will demonstrate how to recreate childhood favourites like Pulled Butter Toffee, Leather Roll-ups, Sherbet Dippers, Cinder Toffee and Turkish Delight

Sweets Made Simple is tipped to be the biggest thing since the Great British Bake Off, and starts on Friday

The sweet shop specialises in 
old-fashioned favourites; retro sweets that conjures up a childhood nostalgia

When she set up shop in 2006, Kitty wanted to create a place where everything was exciting 
and unique. And that ethos encompassed not just the products, but the decor. The shops are

'Our sweet flavours are simply amazing, from Sicilian lemon curd, to coconut ice, to candy floss flavoured boiled sweets - we champion new food trends and pride ourselves on being innovative and original.

'Service is just as important to us as our products and the shops. We provide good old fashioned service. We know our customers' names, birthdays and favourite sweet. We will pat your dog and water your petunias.'

In the show, the couple will demonstrate how to recreate childhood favourites such as pulled butter toffee, leather roll-ups, sherbet dippers, cinder toffee and Turkish delight.

They will also showcase modern treats such as gin and lime truffles, Tequila chillies, salted seashell caramels and gingerbread latte fudge.

The series sees them travelling across the UK as they seek out the best ingredients - from gin in Cambridge to the world's best butter in Country Antrim.

Viewers will learn about the apothecaries of old at St Thomas's Herb Garret in London and take a trip down memory lane to Miss Hope's childhood sweet shop in Heaton, Newcastle.

The central table in their Covent Garden store has a giant display of tempting sweet jars

'When I got the email saying Sweets Made Simple had been commissioned I called Mr. G and said, "There is good news and there is bad news… The good news is, Sweets Made Simple has been commissioned… The bad news is, you need to buy some Spanx".

'I thought to myself, "Why the heck has no one done this before?"

'I think one of the things that puts people off making their own sweets is the fear that it's beyond them. They don't realise just how simple yet exciting it can be. We really hope that Sweets Made Simple shows them just how easy and satisfying it can be to concoct your own flavour combinations and experiment with a different type of cooking. We want people to love making sweets as much as we do.

'There are a million different recipes to be made, the possibilities are endless and it's a huge amount of fun. We're showing people how to make sweets on their kitchen table and demystifying the science.'

Gingerbread latte fudge

Makes 49 splendid squares. Takes about 40 minutes to make, plus chilling.

'Every winter I look forward to the comfort and spice of a gingerbread latte so what better
 than to take the whole exquisite experience and fold some old school 
sticky ginger cake, cream and coffee into a smooth, yielding fudge with a
 frothy latte topping? Every winter I also look forward to hot water 
bottles, winceyette nighties and bed socks. Poor Mr Greenwood,' says Kitty.

Ingredients:

50g (2oz) salted butter, plus extra for greasing75g (2-oz) sticky ginger cake, thinly sliced500g (1lb 2oz) caster sugar150ml (5fl oz) double cream135ml (4-fl oz) full-fat milk1 tsp ground ginger2 tsp ground espresso coffee

Method:

●    Boldly butter a 17cm (6:in) square tin and line with baking parchment. Preheat your grill to medium.●   
 Now lay the ginger cake slices on a baking sheet. Grill until toasted 
on both sides. Allow to cool and then chop it up roughly. Taste to make 
sure it's lovely. ●    Now put the sugar, cream, milk, butter and 3 
tablespoons of water in a large deep pan (I use a 24cm (9-in) diameter 
pan) and heat gently over a very low heat for about 15 minutes, until 
the sugar has dissolved. ●    Wedge a sugar thermometer into the pan
 and turn the heat up a notch until the mixture starts to bubble. Hold 
it at this point, adjusting the heat accordingly, and cook until the 
mixture reaches 116°C (240°F). If you don't have a thermometer, cook at 
this steady pace for about 15 minutes. Give the mixture a stir every now
 and then. ●    As soon as the temperature has been reached, pour 
about a quarter of the ooze into a metal bowl and set aside. Add the 
ginger and coffee to the pan and beat it with vigour for a minute. Stir 
in the chopped cake, which dissolves into the mixture, and continue to 
beat well for 5–8 minutes until the mixture has cooled a little and 
starts to thicken round the edge. It'll be coming away from the edges of
 the pan. ●    Pour into the prepared tin. Give the plain fudge 
mixture a quick beat and spoon dollops over the top. Use a skewer to 
marble the layers – it should look fluffy like a latte. Allow to cool 
then chill for a couple of hours. Cut into squares and eat.
