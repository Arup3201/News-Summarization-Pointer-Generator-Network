Islamic extremists today said they would murder a French tourist captured in Algeria 'within 24 hours' if Paris did not halt its intervention in Iraq.

The sinister threat was made by Jund al-Khilifa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), who are using exactly the same tactics as the Iraq and Syria-based terror group IS (Islamic State), also known as Isis.

Jund al-Khilifa have released a video showing Herve Pierre Gourdel, 55, flanked by two hooded men clutching Kalashnikov assault rifles.

The footage was confirmed as authentic, and came after IS urged Muslims around the world to kill 'the spiteful and filthy' French.

France has been accused of paying ransoms to terrorists in the past, but on Friday its airforce launched bombing raids on IS forces in Iraq.

Today Prime Minister Manuel Valls said there would be 'no discussion, no negotiation and we will never give in to blackmail, even if we are of course very worried after the authentication of this video.'

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve also tried to reassure the country, saying: 'France is not afraid, France is prepared to respond to their threat.'

Jund al-Khilifa, which has pledged its allegiance to IS, said it would kill Mr Gourdel, who is from Nice, within a day.

The group said it captured him while he was hiking with friends in a mountainous region of eastern Algeria.

Algeria, which won independence from France in 1962 following a bitter war of independence, is a hotbed of Islamic terrorism.

The Tizi Ouzou region, where Mr Gourdel was abducted, has been the scene of attacks by al Qaeda's North African branch, AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb).

They have been operating in the mountainous wooded area for more than a decade, since the end of the brutal civil war which decimated Algeria during the 1990s.

On Monday, Islamic State (IS) issued an audio statement calling on Muslims everywhere to kill citizens of nations that have joined the fight against jihadist groups in Iraq.

Spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani called on followers to 'kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war'.

US aircraft have carried out more than 170 strikes since August 8, and President Barack Obama has since been creating an international coalition against the terrorist movement.

The bombing campaign was launched to protect Iraqi Kurdistan from advancing IS forces.

Jihadists who already controlled parts of neighbouring Syria captured the Iraqi city of Mosul on June 10th.

They have also enjoyed success against the Iraqi army, while carrying out a series of atrocities against non-Muslim groups, including Christians.

IS videos of the beheading of two US journalists and a British aid worker in Syria sparked international outrage, as well as calls for more action to crush them.

IS's latest web propaganda will lead to an increase in security and surveillance in France, where 'home-grown' Jihadists are as common as they are in Britain.
