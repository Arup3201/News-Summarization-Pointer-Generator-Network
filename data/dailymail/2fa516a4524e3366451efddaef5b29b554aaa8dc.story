Tragic: Logan Blake, 17, pictured, of Cedar Rapids, was found dead Tuesday afternoon after he was sucked away by the rushing currents

Rescue teams are resuming their search today for an Iowa teen after he was swept into a storm drain during a powerful weather system 
that has been pummeling the Midwest.

Logan Blake, 17, of Cedar Rapids, was playing Frisbee
 with friends in the grounds of an elementary school around
 7:20 p.m. Monday when he was sucked away by the rushing currents, city public 
safety communications coordinator Greg Buelow said in a statement.

Buelow did not explain how the teenager ended up in the drain.

One
 of the teen's friends tried to rescue him but also got swept away in 
the strong storm. The pair were carried deep into sewage drains 
underneath the city.

After a time, the friend resurfaced at Cedar Lake, a mile and a half away. He was injured but alive.

The boy walked to a hospital and was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities have not released the teen's name.

But Blake remains missing.

Early
 Tuesday, Cedar Rapids Fire Department Battalion Chief Brian Gibson said
 he still considered the operation a rescue mission.

Buelow said he expected the search to resume after 8 a.m.

His family and friends are also holding onto hope that he's going to make it however.

'He's
 a strong kid, a very athletic kid,' father Mark Blake said, according 
to ABC News.

'He's got a strong will. We have every faith in the world 
that he's hooked on and waiting for the current to slow down.'

Gibson said the storm drain feeds into an underground concrete pipe about 3 feet wide at the entrance.

Search: Late Monday, rescuers searched Cedar Lake and walked sewer line paths, but were unable to enter the underground sewer system because of the dangerously fast current, the fire department said in a statement

Hopeful? Early Tuesday, Cedar Rapids Fire Department Battalion Chief Brian Gibson said he still considered the operation a rescue mission. But it later turned to recovery  

That pipe runs about a mile and a half southwest and empties into Cedar Lake.

Late
 Monday, rescuers searched Cedar Lake and walked sewer line paths, but 
were unable to enter the underground sewer system because of the 
dangerously fast current, the fire department said in a statement.

Gibson
 said early Tuesday that conditions were still too dangerous for rescue 
crews to go underground but that they would assess that situation 
throughout the day.

The
 city of Cedar Rapids said Monday that recent heavy rainfall had 
overwhelmed the storm sewer system in many parts of the city, causing 
water to rise in the streets and rush through neighborhoods.

The sanitary sewer system also became overwhelmed and overflowed.

A
 band of strong storms washed across the Midwest on Monday evening.

Police said a man in northern Indiana was killed when a tree fell onto a
 trailer home and another died when strong winds caused a building to 
collapse in eastern Iowa.

he raging storms left hundreds of thousands of people without power across Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin.
