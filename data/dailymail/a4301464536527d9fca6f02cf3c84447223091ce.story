Pat Preston, 65, of Whickam in Gateshead used to be prim and polite but she now can't stop swearing after a stroke she suffered in January

Grandmother Pat Preston used to think of herself as a was a prim and proper woman.

The nature of her job as a bank customer service adviser demanded she was extremely polite and well-mannered.  

But now the 65-year-old can't help but swear like a trooper  after suffering a stroke that changed her personality.

Mrs Preston,  of Whickam in Gateshead shocked her husband Michael, 66, by letting rip a stream of four-letter worlds in front of her doctors, in the presence of friends.

And she has even called her young grandchildren 'little b*****s'.

The change was brought about by a stroke she suffered in January.

It left Mrs Preston unable to control her feelings, blurting out swear words when prior to her stroke she would've refrained from vocalising her thoughts. 

She now has a 'swear box' in which she adds money after using inappropriate words, and is working with a psychologist to come to terms with the changes.

Mrs Preston said: 'Before I had a stroke I would still get annoyed at things but I could control my upset, however now I just can't help it. 

'I can swear during conversations and a couple of weeks ago my grandchildren were playing up and I called them 'little b*****s'.

'My husband gets annoyed because he's a retired headteacher and gets horrified sometimes at what I say. I can get a little nervous too about what language I might use.

'If something really annoys me I am not able to keep my thoughts to myself and I'm quite outspoken. 

'If I go into a shop and don't like how the assistants are reacting to me or even someone else I will say so.

'I was not aware that a stroke could affect someone in this way and change their personality. My close family and friends still can't quite accept that I've had a stroke.'

Mrs Preston had just enjoyed a weekend of birthday celebrations in January and was in a shopping centre in Gateshead when she began to feel unwell, coming over faint, with a headache and sweating.

She immediately called her husband, but was so breathless she could not get her words out.

Yet it was only when got home and found she couldn't move her legs to get out of the car that the emergency services were called.

Mrs Preston was taken to Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital where she was assessed and treated by specialists.

She remained in the combined stroke unit for more than six weeks.

Her home has since been adapted and Mrs Preston now relies on walking sticks to get around.

Mrs Preston said her husband Michael, 66, a retired headteacher was shocked after she swore in front of doctors, in the presence of friends and even called her young grandchildren 'little b*****s'

'I would be telling lies if I said that there is not a time each day that I don't think about what happened and the impact it's had on my life,' she said.

'But I have to accept what has happened and move forward the best that I can as you only get one life.

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. 

This can damage or change parts of the brain, which is known to cause a whole variety of neuropsychological and behavioral changes.

Depression is the most common, but stroke has also been known to cause uncontrollable laughing or crying or neglect syndrome, in which people don't recognise one side of their visual field.

Last year a Brazilian man developed what doctors have called pathological generosity, after a stroke damaged parts of his brain, causing his behaviour to change.

The 49-year-old began to give away money, food and drinks excessively and even quit his corporate job because he felt he could no longer work there following his personality change.

Doctors said the stroke disrupted the part of his brain related to higher thinking and decision making.

'I am about 75 per cent back to what I was like before the stroke.

I feel very lucky that I can carry on with my life as I am and you have got to see the funny side of things or it would get you down.' 

Mrs Preston is receiving help from psychologists to come to terms with the changes in her life and has been able to regain movement to her affected left side thanks to working with occupational therapists.

Specialist stroke nurse Marie Twentyman, who works at Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said: 'Patients can have a change of personality following a stroke. 

'Sometimes words get mixed up in the brain and vocabulary that would not normally be used by a patients is.

'Stroke affects everyone differently. 

'When Pat was on the ward you could see that she would become frustrated as she had been so independent before, and it was when she became tired and frustrated that she would use language that she would not normally have used.

'It is very important that if anyone is suspected to have suffered a stroke that they seek medical treatment quickly so that treatment can be given as soon as possible.'

On Saturday, Pat is hosting a charity event to raise funds for Ward 22 at the QE Hospital to thank staff for the care she received.

She hopes to raise more than £500 to purchase six personal DVD players for patients, and Lloyds TSB in Gateshead has agreed to match donations up to £500.
