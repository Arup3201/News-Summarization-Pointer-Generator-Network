While violence rages on the streets of Venezuela, the children of former president Hugo Chavez have refused to move out of the presidential palace and turned it into a party pad.

Rosa Virginia, 35, and Maria Gabriela Chavez, 33, are reportedly holding raucous nights in the luxurious six-bedroom villa, complete with a swimming pool and private movie theater.

Current president Nicolas Maduro has a constitutional right to live there, but this problem may be low down his list of priorities, as civil unrest engulfs the country killing five people so far.

Holding on: The daughters of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez are reportedly refusing to leave the luxurious presidential palace, and are holding 'deafening' parties there

Family: Maria Rosa (left) and Rosa Virginia (right) Chavez, daughters of the ex-president who died in March 2013, are refusing to leave the palace they have lived in for over a decade

The Sunday Times reported that palace neighbors have complained of 'deafening' parties held at the compound, which is full of valuable art and antiques.

Fast food restaurants and other companies will apparently no longer deliver to the compound over unpaid bills.

The paper also stated that concert organizers are sick of giving free tickets to Chavez's children

Last November, the BBC reported the Chavez daughters had refused to leave the property that they have lived in for over a decade. 

Tragic: Meanwhile, unrest continues  across Venezuela. Beauty queen Genesis Carmona was rushed to hospital by motorcycle after being shot in the head during an anti-government protest in Valencia on Wednesday. The 22-year-old university student died from her injuries

Victim: Carmona, who was Miss Tourism 2013 for Carabobo state, was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman who opened fire at anti-government protesters

Rosa Virginia and Maria Gabriela have reportedly had 'several altercations' with President Maduro and his wife over the issue.

Meanwhile, riots continue on the streets of the country.

Paratroopers are heading to a Venezuelan border area torn by fierce clashes between police and anti-government protesters.

And
 security forces are being accused of turning many parts of the country 
into free-fire zones in their bid to silence a rejuvenated movement 
challenging socialist rule.

President
 Nicolas Maduro's opponents charged Thursday that he has unleashed the 
military, police and civilian militias against those who blame the 
administration for hardships in a country that is rich in oil but 
struggling with overheated inflation and one of the world's worst 
homicide rates.

Violence has
 escalated across Venezuela since a Feb. 12 opposition rally that was 
followed by clashes between young activists and the National Guard in 
which three people died.

At least three more deaths and dozens of injuries have occurred in protest violence since then.

Leopoldo
 Lopez, the jailed opposition leader who organized the mass rally, was 
ordered early Thursday to remain in detention to face charges that 
include arson and criminal incitement.

Embattled: It is current President Nicolas Maduro's right to live in teh palace but he has bigger problems at the moment, such as the protests sweeping the country. Five people have died in clashes with authorities so far

Violence: A student participates in a protest in Altamira this week. On Thursday President Maduro threatened to expel television network CNN from the country if it did not 'rectify' the way it has covered deadly political protests

Tensions could be high Friday in the city of Valencia, where a funeral was scheduled for a local beauty queen who was killed by a bullet this week while participating in a protest.

The death of Genesis Carmona, a 22-year-old university student who had been Miss Tourism 2013 for Carabobo state, reverberated in this country that prizes beauty queens.

Carmona was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman who opened fire at anti-government protesters.

Miss Carmona, a marketing student and beauty queen, slumped to the ground. A bystander scooped her up in his arms and put her on his motorbike.

But despite rushing her to hospital for emergency surgery, doctors were unable to save her life. On Wednesday night Miss Carmona’s family were in shock.

‘How long are we going to live like this? How long do we have to tolerate this pressure, with them killing us?’ a relative said. ‘She only needed one more semester to graduate,’ he added.

On Thursday President Maduro threatened to expel television network CNN from the country if it did not 'rectify' the way it has covered deadly political protests.

At least five people have been killed in the unrest that the government blames on opposition-led 'fascists' and that its rivals blame on the security forces.

Unrest: A demonstrator holds an iron chain in front of the riot police during a newsprint shortage protest in Caracas. Some 600 people took to the streets of the Venezuelan capital on February 11 to protest a newsprint shortage that has caused the temporary closure of dozens of newspapers

Local television networks have provided almost no live coverage of the protests against Maduro, which began last month over a wide range of complaints including inflation, violent crime, corruption and shortages of basic products.

As a result, many opposition supporters have turned to CNN Espanol, available to some cable TV subscribers, which in recent days has been the only television to offer live broadcasts of opposition press conferences.

'I've asked the (information) minister to tell CNN we have started the administrative process to remove them from Venezuela if they don't rectify (their behavior),' Maduro said on state TV.

'Enough! I won't accept war propaganda against Venezuela.'

'We do not have an official comment at this time on President Maduro's most recent comments about CNN,' Bridget Leininger, a CNN spokeswoman, said in an email to Reuters.
