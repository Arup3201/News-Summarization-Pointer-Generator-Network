A German magazine has come under fire for a front-cover photograph of Michael Schumacher in sunglasses and a winter coat with the words: 'What luck! He sits in the sun!'

The photo shows the seven-time Formula 1 champion wearing Aviator-style sunglasses and a black winter jacket.

Die Aktuelle, a women's lifestyle magazine, then writes: 'Moments that touch our hearts.'

Die Aktuelle, a women's lifestyle magazine, has come under fire for trying to deceive its readers into thinking this is the first picture of Michael Schumacher since his skiing accident - it is actually from January 26, 2013

The magazine has been accused of tricking readers into believing this is the first photograph of Schumacher since he sustained brain injuries in a freak skiing accident last December.

It claims that stricken Schumacher, 45, is 'pushed on to the terrace by (his wife) Corinna on mild autumn days' in his wheelchair.

The photograph was actually taken in St Moritz, Switzerland, on January 26, 2013.

The German news magazine Focus branded the cover 'deceptive'.

Online publication Motorsport.com said: 'How low can you go? it seems that there is no limit for certain publications.

'The majority of readers will not notice the date of the photograph which is written in small typeface.'

The German news website news.de said: 'Die Aktuelle proves once again that for the publication there's no bad taste that's too bad. The sole objective is to increase circulation.' 

When Schumacher was in a coma, a photograph of Schumacher was splashed on the front with the headline: 'Woke Up!' The article was in fact about the experiences of three other people who had awoken from a coma

Schumacher, 45, was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to Lausanne Hospital, Switzerland, in June and he is now being cared for at his home on the shores of Lake Geneva

It is not the first time that the magazine has been accused of attempting to deceive readers with Schumacher-related stories.

When Schumacher was in a coma, a photograph of Schumacher was splashed on the front with the headline: 'Woke Up!'

The article was in fact about the experiences of three other people who had awoken from a coma.

The German motoring racing legend cannot speak and has memory problems.

He is paralysed and in a wheelchair according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff.

Schumacher, 45, was transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to Lausanne Hospital, Switzerland, in June and he is now being cared for at his home on the shores of Lake Geneva.

It was December 29 when he suffered a freak ski accident in the French Alps which left him brain damaged and fighting for his life.

Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet.

He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. 

But he lost control and hit a partially-covered rock. He was then catapulted 34 feet on to another rock.

He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet.

His wife Corinna has been a constant presence at his bedside.

With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. 

This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.
