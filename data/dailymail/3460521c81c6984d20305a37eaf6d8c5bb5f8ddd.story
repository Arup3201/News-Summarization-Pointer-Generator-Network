She's tweeted about her sleepless nights attending to a teething baby but there were no signs of bags under Fearne Cotten's eyes as she returned to modelling for Very.co.uk.

The new mother - who gave birth to her son, Rex, in February - cuts a stylish figure showcasing her latest collection for the popular e-tailer.

In one shot, the 31-year-old wears a figure-hugging fuchsia disco dress and sky-scraper black stilettos, while in another she dons a floaty purple dress with matching heels.

While she was pregnant, Fearne turned to Tali Lennox and DJ Leah Weller to model her 
previous two collections.

But five months after giving birth, she returns in 
front of the camera to show off her Autumn/Winter 13 range.

Fearne has been following the Honestly Healthy diet, which is favoured by Victoria Beckham and Millie Mackintosh, and involves eating predominantly alkaline foods in an effort to keep 
the body’s pH between 7.35 and 7.45.

The starlet recently tweeted to credit the programme for her post-baby weightloss, and judging by her latest photoshoot, it worked wonders.

Sporting natural make up, tousled 
hair and a radiant glow, Fearne looks better than ever following the 
birth of her son 5 months ago.

The TV and radio presenter turned 
fashion designer may have recently dyed her hair pink, but sports her 
trademark blonde locks for the shoot.

Fearne's Autumn/Winter collection including this long-sleeve dress, is available in sizes 8-20

Available in sizes 8-20, the range includes gold embellished tops and trousers with a gothic influence, along with bright printed dresses.

The latest clothes, which cost from £22 to £69, form Fearne's tenth
collection for Very.co.uk, who she has worked with since 2009. Last 
month she unveiled a homeware collection with them too.

Jon Owen, retail director of Very.co.uk said they were delighted with their continuing collaboration with the star.

'Our customers always respond well to Fearne's collection as she is such a strong icon and great ambassador for her range,' he said.

'Fearne's AW13 collection gives our customers access to her signature style, and the ability to make it work for them.'

Fearne- who is engaged to Jesse Wood, 
son of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood- has been spending her 
maternity leave baking, designing and spending time with baby Rex.

Fearne will return to her role as a DJ on Radio One's mid-morning slot from September after Sara Cox has covered her maternity leave for the station.

She recently told MailOnline that she was unsure how she would cope when she returned to her Radio 1 gig.

She
said: 'I won't know how to do it anymore. I won't be able to use the 
desk. I'll probably talk utter rubbish but nothing's new there!'
