Sheffield United left themselves open to more criticism on Friday night after their co-chairman said he was ‘angry and upset’ that they had been forced to withdraw their offer to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train with them.

The League One club bowed to pressure on Thursday after their decision to welcome back their former striker sparked a furore, with Jessica Ennis-Hill demanding her name be removed from a stand at Bramall Lane should the club re-sign Evans, and four high-profile patrons resigning. 

But co-chairman Jim Phipps reignited the controversy on Friday night when he argued the decision was unfair on Evans, who was released from prison last month having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a woman in a hotel room. ‘I’m angry we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done,’ said Phipps.

Sheffield United co-chairman believes that the decision to do a U-turn is a defeat for principles

‘I’m upset that we are not able to do what we wanted to do, but I acknowledge that my view is not the only view. My principles and the board’s principles are not the only thing that matter.

‘The influence of mob-like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing Ched to train. I will acknowledge that our decision to not let Ched train is probably a decision that will make it harder for him to get on with his football career.

‘The people who believe Ched should be punished for the rest of his life might call that a victory. I think of it as a defeat for the principle that punishment under the justice system should be left to those that are authorised by law.

Jessica Ennis-Hill wanted her name removed from the stand named after her if Evans was offered a deal

Charlie Webster also stated on the BBC's Panorama that she would stand down as a patron of the club on the

Olympian Ennis-Hill (right) was one of the patrons of the club who openly criticised the club 

‘We are a community and family club and we had our people at each others’ throats and the promise was that things weren’t going to get better.’

Phipps’ view is sure to anger the supporters who took a stand over Evans, not to mention more than 150,000 people who signed a petition opposing the Welsh international striker’s return to football.

Evans will receive support from the Professional Footballers’ Association in trying to find a club. Having made an application to the criminal cases review commission for an appeal against his conviction, it could be Evans has to wait until after that process has been completed.

But in a statement the PFA insisted 25-year-old Evans has the right to ‘return to the job he is trained to do’.

‘We fully understand the opposing views to Ched’s return and clearly part of the issue related to him returning to the club he was previously with at the time of his imprisonment,’ said the statement. ‘It may be of benefit for Ched to look for a different club.

‘We do not agree society should impose different rules for footballers which go beyond the position of the law.’
