Ukip faces fresh claims of hypocrisy after it emerged its small business spokesman employed seven illegal immigrants in his restaurant.

Immigration officials raided the Manchester restaurant, set up by Amjad Bashir with his two sons Tayub and Mudassar, last year.

It follows revelations that the anti-EU party had leaflets printed in Germany, hired eastern Europeans to hand out flyers and used an Irish actor in poster campaign opposing immigration.

Mr Bashir is standing for Ukip in next week’s European elections and he appeared on stage alongside Mr Farage at a rally last week designed to reject claims the party is racist.

The Zouk Tea Bar and Grill in Manchester was raided on June 1 last year, The Times reported.

The family have denied any wrongdoing and party leader Nigel Farage said they are appealing and he was not going to ‘prejudge’ the case.

Three days after the raid Mr Bashir reportedly resigned as a director of the company which owns the restaurant a sister branch in Bradford.

However he remains a major shareholder and has continued to take a role in the running of the restaurant.

Mr Bashir, 61, is second on Ukip’s list of candidates for the Yorkshire and the Humber region in this month’s European elections.

The Home Office confirmed seven people were arrested ‘for a variety of immigration offences’ and a civil penalty notice was served after the raid.

Tayub Bashir told The Times that they were appealing against the notice and had not yet paid a fine.

He said the restaurant conducted immigration checks on all employees and vigorously denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Farage told BBC’s This Week: ‘His son is the director and runs that business and they had an argument and a row with the immigration people which they are appealing. I’m not going to prejudge that.’

However, Lib Dem MEP Edward McMillan-Scott said: ‘Forget the obvious hypocrisy; employing illegal immigrants is exploitative and against the law.

‘Not only are Ukip whipping up ill-feeling towards immigrants, they are supporting a man who has made money off the back of illegal workers.’

It is the latest episode which has left Ukip exposed to criticism for appearing to act against its own anti-immigration policies.

Ukip claimed its poster campaign was a 'hard-hitting reflection of reality' - but it later emerged that it had used an Irish actor to represent a British builder put out of work because of immigration

This week it emerged the party has been printing anti-EU election leaflets - in Germany. Mr Farage's party has campaigned to protect British jobs, slash immigration and pull out of the European Union.

But
 instead of using a British firm to help the party's campaign it took 
'full advantage of the European single market' to place its order 
abroad.

It follows the revelation the party had hired Eastern Europeans to hand out its anti-immigration 
flyers ahead of next week's European elections.

Latvians
 were employed by a company called Fast Leaflet in Croydon, south 
London, to hand out flyers for Mr Farage's party.

One of the stars of a Ukip poster campaign, 
who appeared to be a British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap 
labour’, was actually an Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke.
