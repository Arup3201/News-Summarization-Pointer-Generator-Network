Emma Stone is the latest actress to land the U.S. cover of Vogue.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2 actress, 25, who follows in the controversial footsteps of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, wears a leather cap on the cover and a printed Gucci dress.

And though she is usually notoriously private about her relationship, she also discusses boyfriend and co-star Andrew Garfield in the interview.

'I think I’ve 
learned a lot by being around him,' Miss Stone says of the actor, who she has been dating since 2011. 'And, you 
know, he is an incredibly important person to me.'

Indeed, it seems both have valued each others support while filming the Spiderman movies, their closeness proving more of a help than a hindrance.

Busy lady: Miss Stone reveals that she is currently working on several new projects, all top-secret, though she was forced to turn down the chance to play Sally Bowles in Cabaret on Broadway due to Spider-Man

Leading lady: The actress got her break in the film Easy A, and went on to star opposite Ryan Gosling in Crazy, Stupid Love. Now she has three major movies lined up in the next year

'It’s
 not harder,' she says. 'It’s fun. It’s been fun working with him just 
because of who he is as an actor and person. I think it would be fun no 
matter what.'

This sentiment is echoed by British-born Mr Garfield, 30, who adds: 'I thank my lucky stars 
that we’ve been able to be on this ride together. We all need companions in the mystery to get you out of your head and 
into your heart, to moan to and to take the piss out of it all with.'

Miss Stone reveals that she is currently working on several new projects, all top-secret, though she was forced to turn down the chance to play Sally Bowles in Cabaret on Broadway due to Spider-Man commitments (Michelle Williams took on the role instead).

She has a role in Woody Allen's upcoming Magic in the Moonlight, which she reveals is set in the 1920s and was filmed in France, and an as-yet untitled project with Cameron Crowe that filmed in Hawaii.

Vogue debut: This is not the first time Miss Stone has graced the cover of the fashion glossy. She has landed the prestigious spot once before, in July 2012

This is not the first time Miss Stone has graced the cover of Vogue. She has landed the prestigious spot once before, in July 2012.

And it is perhaps a canny move on Ms Wintour's part to have chosen Miss Stone for the May cover. While the May cover, featuring Kim Kardashian and Kanye West is tipped to be the title's best selling of the year, it did incite a backlash. Miss Stone - young, slender, Hollywood A-list - is a more traditional cover girl and could help win back any lost readers.
