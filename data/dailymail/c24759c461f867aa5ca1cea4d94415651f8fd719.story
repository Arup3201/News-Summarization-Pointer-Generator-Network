Extremely graphic images show the aftermath of a fight that broke out at a Jay-Z and Beyonce concert over the weekend, when one man bit off the fingertip of another.

Police say 25-year-old Roberto Alcaraz Garnica started groping an unnamed man's girlfriend, and the two got into a fight.

Garnica took the brawl to a whole other level though when he chomped town on the man's finger, taking out a large chunk of flesh.

Pictures of the victim's severed fingertip have since been released to TMZ, and they are stomach turning.
