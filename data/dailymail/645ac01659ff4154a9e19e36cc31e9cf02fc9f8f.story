Barcelona warmed up for their Champions League tie against Apoel Nicosia at their  Ciutat Esportiva training ground on Tuesday, which will be  renamed in honour of the club's late manager Tito Vilanova.

According to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona's Board of Directors have approved a proposal to rename Barcelona’s main training pitch the ‘Campo de Entrenamiento Tito Vilanova’ to celebrate the popular former coach who died from throat cancer in April, aged 45.

The club felt it was during training where Vilanova did his best work, so this was an appropriate way of remembering him.

The Spaniard was held in high esteem throughout the club, and he led Barcelona to the La Liga title in 2012-13, his only season as manager.

That campaign was interrupted by cancer treatment in New York however, and the club legend succumbed to the disease earlier this year.

Vilanova was also Pep Guardiola's assistant between 2008 and 2012 when the Catalans won La Liga three times and two Champions League titles.

The date on which the club will officially rename the training ground has yet to be announced. 

Barcelona have not won a major trophy since Vilanova's departure, but the players, including Lionel Messi and Neymar, looked relaxed in Tuesday's training session as the Catalans prepared to face Apoel Nicosia in Wednesday's Champions League clash.
