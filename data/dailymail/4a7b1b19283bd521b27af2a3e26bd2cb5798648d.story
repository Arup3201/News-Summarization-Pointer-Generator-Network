Lewis Hamilton fixed his inquisitor with his coldest stare. ‘Why would I crash?’ he bristled. ‘Have I crashed all year?’ He paused. Considered biting back again. Decided against it. ‘I’m pretty good at this, you know,’ he murmured.

Nobody asks Hamilton about crashing most weeks. But this isn’t most weeks. It is the week. Final week. Double points week. The week of truth. The week of destiny. The week of pure racing freedom. The next 48 hours, Hamilton agrees, are the most important of his professional life. ‘I’m fully aware of that,’ he adds. ‘Of course I know that.’

Crashing is suddenly on the agenda because with the stakes higher than at any time this year, the liberty to be good, or bad, when racing begins is also at its greatest.

Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg are the only drivers capable of winning the prize. With the constructors’ title long decided, instruction will now be kept to a minimum. Within the reasonable parameters of team support, there will be no limit on selfish ambition and that carries risk. Ayrton Senna took Alain Prost out at 160mph in 1990 in similar circumstances. If Hamilton did the same thing to Rosberg, he would be champion.

‘That’s not me,’ Hamilton insisted. ‘I want to win by winning.’

There’s no temptation to be naughty?

‘I want to win by winning. I’ve never raced that way.’

Ayrton Senna was your hero and he could be naughty.

Small pause. Quietly, almost a murmur again. ‘I don’t think Ayrton was naughty,’ Hamilton said.

We don’t get Lewis Hamilton, the way we didn’t get Andy Murray. We don’t get what drives them, their desires, their furies.

We wonder why they can’t be like everybody else, lose those outer prickles. We compare Murray to Tim Henman, and Hamilton to James Hunt, Damon Hill or Nigel Mansell, grouping them by sport.

Yet whiie Henman and the drivers are familiar products of their sporting culture — the way Alastair Cook typifies English cricket or Wayne Rooney has the background of many captains of the England football team — Hamilton and Murray are men apart.

World tennis champions do not come from nondescript towns north of Glasgow; grand prix greats are not born in Stevenage council houses.

Even in Abu Dhabi, when Hamilton spoke at the pre-race press conference on Thursday he was the only black man in the room. His attitude, like Murray, is that of the outsider.

Your former kart boss Dino Chiesa had a lot of nice things to say about you.

‘He wasn’t a kart boss.’

He was an adviser, or whatever role he had there...

‘He was a mechanic.’

Hamilton’s mantra this weekend is that it is just another race. Fastest in practice on Friday, he did not appear a man with weight on his shoulders. Maybe he isn’t. Maybe his spikiness — the look of disdain for Rosberg’s proffered hand in the photoshoot was priceless — is just the suit of armour he has donned through the years.

Hamilton will know he is not a natural fit with men like Bernie Ecclestone; he will know he has never been widely popular back home. Certainly, he will know playing the game will not change that. So he pleases himself. He wins — just as Murray won to change public perception.

‘I am very much aware that this is a platform,’ Hamilton said. ‘There are people turning up with my caps on, turning up with flags, people I meet at the airport or on the street who are shaking because they watch me every weekend, are nervous for me, excited for me, who are with me, wishing they could be me. I do feel like I’m living the dream for others — that’s why I like to share it through posting pictures and by saying positive things rather than just waving a bunch of cash around.’

Like Floyd Mayweather?

‘Yeah. I’ve no interest in inspiring people like that,’ Hamilton continued. ‘I want it to be more than, “Hey, here’s me by a car... here’s me by a mountain”. I want to tell them, “If I can do it, you can do it”.’

If Lewis Hamilton finishes second in Abu Dhabi he will win the title, but things have not always gone well for him in the season finale.

In his debut year in 2007, a first-lap error and a gearbox issue meant he lost the World Championship while he only won in 2008 on the final corner of the last lap. Not the best omen for Sunday’s race. 

One of Hamilton’s latest posts quotes Martin Luther King.

His dream is more mundane, obviously, but that does not make it worthless and it should be Hamilton’s prize on Sunday. He has not been out of the top two in the last six grand prix races, and if he replicates that finish he will be champion.

As this will be his second title, it will be a modern milestone. He would be the first British driver to win multiple championships since Jackie Stewart (1969, 1971 and 1973), and join an exclusive band of British racers comprising Graham Hill (1962 and 1968) and Jim Clark (1963 and 1965).

Hamilton claimed not to have considered his place in the pantheon before it was mentioned, but maybe that is a defence mechanism, too.

He already knows he has a way to fall if unsuccessful, without adding the gaze of history to the equation. There is so much that is random to go wrong in Formula One, plus the spanner in the works of arbitrary double points. If Hamilton finishes first, second or simply ahead of Rosberg, he wins. If Rosberg wins and Hamilton finishes seventh or lower, the German wins — under the scoring system used for the previous 18 races. The controversy arises if Rosberg wins and Hamilton finishes third, fourth, fifth or sixth; or Rosberg comes second and Hamilton finishes between sixth and 10th. In this situation, the German is champion because this race — and only this race — counts double.

Hamilton would still claim a place in history — but only in the most gypped category. With the randomness of technical malfunctions, a twist of fate here could have greater professional consequence than any event in Hamilton’s career. This is his to lose, and he knows it.

‘I’m excited,’ he insisted. ‘Why shouldn’t I be? I’m in the best place in my whole life. I’m with the best team, I’ve got the best car, I’m in the best shape — I’m excited, man. I’m excited. The last two times I went into the championship, I was probably nervous. It’s a lot different now.

‘I’ve got to control it but I’m good at that. I guess it’s the same as keeping pretty chilled when I get to drive a Formula One car every weekend. That’s a pretty huge thing — but controlling it is how I’m built. I can’t wait to get in the car.

‘I have a plan. I’m working with my guys, we’ve already spoken about it, all the things I need to focus on, all the things I’ve learned through the year. I don’t need to drive the race of my life; just my best. I feel I’m here like any other weekend. If you build it up that’s when the issues come.’

It is perhaps a sign of Hamilton’s resolve that he will be without his family in Abu Dhabi. Asked for the guest list, he became tight-lipped again. ‘No-one,’ he said. ‘A few friends in the grandstand. Generally, through the year, I’ve not had people come.’ Another beat. ‘I’ve got a job to do.’ He stared that cool stare. A very singular man, Lewis Hamilton.
