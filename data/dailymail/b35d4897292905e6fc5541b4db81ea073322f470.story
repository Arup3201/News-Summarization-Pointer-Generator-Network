Australian property is now the most overvalued in the world as the Spring action season continues to break records with 80 per cent of properties under the hammer selling at a record rate.

Property experts say the 'lack of supply' is driving up house prices to 'crazy levels' across the country. 

New research for Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has found that Australian home prices are higher than they typically have been when compared to rents and incomes.

9 Pyrl Road, Artamon in Sydney's north west was sold for $2,950,000, that was $350,000 above the reserve

One house that did very well at auction over the weekend was one sold by John McManus an agent for LJ Hooker Willoughby. 

It was 9 Pyrl Road, Artamon in north Sydney and it went for $350,000 above the reserve. 

Mr McManus told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was incredible, the neighbours could not believe it, it was fierce bidding and it broke all records in Artamon. 

'It caught us all off guard, we thought it would go for $2.4million or $2.5million.

'It was just crazy and it went well above the reserve we set of $2.6million.

Mr McManus for LJ Hooker Willoughby said: 'It caught us all off guard' 

The five bedroom home is very desirable with a swimming pool and is close to local schools 

It also has two bathrooms and two car parking spaces

'This is going to be one of the biggest seasons for property between September, October, November and I think it will go into December. 

'All my buyers are saying we need to buy sooner rather than later and I am doing everything I can, but there is just not enough stock.' 

Another home that went well above the auction price was 60 Phillip Street, Birchgrove, near Balmain in Sydney's inner west. 

60 Phillip Street, Birchgrove, Sydney sold for $1,227,000, that was $77,000 above the reserve price

Agent Monique Dower said: 'Buyers just need to keep looking' 

The house sold for $1,227,000 this weekend and it went $77,000 above the auction reserve. 

Agent Monique Dower for Belle Property in Balmain told Daily Mail Australia: 'There has been a lack of supply for a year and a half and it is busy with more buyer interest. 

'We are telling buyers to be be patient and keep looking because this area is only going to continue to thrive.

'Buyers just need to keep looking. The Spring market has started a bit earlier this year and we were very surprised to see this house sell for so much, it's crazy. 

'We need more of these kinds of two bedroom properties, there is a lot of demand for them. 

'We will see more three and four bedroom homes coming onto the market in a few weeks.

'The reserve for this house was $115,000,000 so it went well above. 

'The lack of supply and demand is causing the madness, any house with parking and a harbour view is going to be desirable.' 

The auction market is also very competitive in Melbourne with over 1000 homes a week being sold under the hammer.  

13 Edro Avenue, Brighton East,  Victoria, south of Melbourne, was one of the country's top sales this weekend

Recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund, the BIS has found that Australian home prices are higher than they typically have been when compared to rents and incomes.

Homes across Australia were 50 per cent higher than usual relative to rents, and around 40 per cent higher than usual when compared to incomes, according to ABC. 

The BIS has warned that overvalued markets are more likely to see prices slide in the future, especially in Australia where wages are not growing strongly.

Queensland estate agent Jan Cower for Ray White Alderley told Daily Mail Australia it was 'very unusual' for auction homes to go way above their reserve. 

She said: 'The property market is slower up here than in Melbourne and Sydney.' 

This unit in Newmarket, of five flats was sold for $1.79million, $90,000 above its reserve price

Jan Cowan said the sale was 'very unusual' because it was a rare property 

This unit in  North Street,Newmarket, north of Brisbane, sold for $1.79million, that was $90,000 above the reserve price.

Ms Cowan added: 'It was a rare kind of property and bidding was very good. There was a lot of interest with the block being just 4km from the city.'  

Robert Larocca, auction market spokesman for RP Data, told Daily Mail Australia: 'This is the best start to Spring we have had since 2010, it is very good. 

'We have got a really strong Sydney market and a very healthy Melbourne market and that is where most of the examples are across Australia.

'The state of the market will be of no surprise to people who have been following it. 

'The clearance rates we are seeing are not dissimilar to last year, 80 per cent is very strong and to see it continuing is a the sign of a very strong market. 

'Sellers price expectations are being regularly exceeded, that will encourage more home-owners to put their homes on the market.

'Melbourne's auction market is not quite as strong as Sydney but we have around 1000 homes on the auctions this week and that is a good sign.'
