Victim: Dr. Michael Davidson is currently in a 'life threatening condition' after the shooting on Tuesday morning

The cardiologist shot twice and critically injured by a gunman at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday morning had treated the shooter's mother before she passed away.

Stephen Pasceri, 55, appeared to deliberately target heart surgeon Dr. Michael Davidson and asked for the doctor at the desk of the world renowned hospital's heart unit before opening fire.

Pasceri, who is married and has children and is reported to be a resident of Milbury, Massachusetts, then turned the gun on himself in an examination room afterwards and ended his life.

According to WCVB, Pasceri was licensed to carry a gun and police have said that his family had no idea he would ever have planned to commit murder. 

One of Pasceri's friends said to WHDH the family 'are in shock and say he was the nicest guy.'

His mother, Marguerite Pasceri, died on November 15, 2014 and was reportedly treated at one point by the cardiologist who is also an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

Her obituary wrote that she 'died surrounded by the family she had loved so much in life. A light has gone from the world that can never be replaced.'

In the same obituary, it added that she will be deeply missed by her children, Stephen, Angela, Matthew, Andrew and Rebecca.

The Massachusetts Public Notices advisory states that Stephen Pasceri was also the executor of his mother’s will and estate.

The suspect entered Brigham and Women's Hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, sometime before 11 a.m. Tuesday and requested the doctor by name, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said.

Evans says police were on the scene at Brigham and Women's Hospital within seconds after getting the first calls of the shooting.

Officers conducting a room-by-room search found the Pasceri dead of a self-inflicted wound in an examination room. His gun was also found.

Evans did not disclose a motive but said earlier on Tuesday afternoon that Pasceri wasn't a patient of the doctor.

Earlier Boston police had mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody.

The shooting occurred in the Carl J. and Ruth Shapiro Cardiovascular Center on the second floor, inside another examination room.

'The shooter came into the hospital asking for this particular doctor,' Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said. 'We don't know why. That's something we're looking into.' 

'There is something in the past that upset this guy to come in looking for this particular doctor,' added Evans to reporters at the press conference.

'They found who we believe to be the suspect inside an examining room with what appeared to be at this time clearly a self-inflicted gunshot wound,' Evans said. 

Brigham and Women's Hospital president Dr. Betsy Nable said earlier onTuesday afternoon they would not be providing information on the doctor's identity, but said his injuries were life threatening.

Commissioner Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately.

'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com.

'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said. 

Police have said the situation was declared resolved at around 11.54am, but earlier there was a confusing situation. 

'There has been a shooting in the Shapiro building, and the suspect has been apprehended. The Shapiro center has been locked down, and all staff are asked to remain in place,' the hospital said in a statement.

One witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene.

'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB.

Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building.

In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event.

'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe.
