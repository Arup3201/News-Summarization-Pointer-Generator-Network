Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on some of the mad happenings during pre-season at The Hive.

FROM SERIE A TO THE CONFERENCE

We've had a 21-year-old Italian lad called Gianluca Rubin training with us who has been captain of Juventus's Under 20s.

A few years ago, there is no way any Italian would've even heard of the Conference, let alone come on trial for a contract.

He paid for his own flight and accommodation and is looking for an English club after being released by Juventus.

He's back! Mad Dog Martin Allen is raring to go as the new season gets started

Last Tuesday, he played in the centre of defence in a reserve game for us alongside an 18-year-old called Gater – his name's Joe, but I like to call him Ali.

They are two young lads from very different football backgrounds. Gianluca from Serie A champions who were regularly playing in the Champions League. And Gater who we got from Aldershot when they stopped their youth policy for financial reasons.

Well, Gianluca is a good player and very good technically, but unfortunately I don't think he will cut it as a 5ft 9ins centre-back in an away game against Halifax on a Tuesday night.

But Gater is a maniac. He heads it and boots it and is a fearless warrior.

Contrast: The Hive is rather different to the Juventus Arena, as young trialist Gianluca Rubin has found out

DRILLING FOR... WATER

It was like a scene from Dallas at our Hive training ground last month.

We've had drilling and pumping going on – not for oil, but for water to get the sprinklers on.

Our training pitches were getting dry and becoming difficult to work on for the players. It can cause injuries. So the chairman found a company who brought in a huge drill and set up a tent around it to dig down to some water pipes.

Lo-and-behold, within two minutes of the drill striking H2O, it started to rain. Marvellous.

Striking for water? It's been like an episode of Dallas at The Hive during pre-season  

OFF TO A FLYER

There was definitely something in the water on Saturday – what a result my Barnet side beating Chester 5-0 in the first game of the Conference season.

I went in to see the chairman after the game and he hugged me but was shaking his head. I asked him what was wrong.

'I missed the first three goals, Martin,' he said. He told me he'd only arrived in Chester 10 minutes into the second half due to the traffic on the M6 where there was an accident.

'I saw the fourth goal then the stadium announcer asked for the driver of a black BMW to move their car because it was blocking someone in.'

'Martin,' he added,' I missed the fifth goal as I was moving my car! The biggest away victory in all my time as Barnet chairman and I've only seen one goal. I can't believe it.'

WADDOCK 101

Since Gary Waddock left Oxford last month he has been our VIP guest down at Barnet for quite a few days.

Managers get sacked and forgotten and the phone doesn't ring. It can be very lonely, worrying and the self-esteem can drop to the floor. Self-doubt can creep in and you wonder where the next job is coming from.

VIP: Allen has been helping out Gary Waddock since he left Oxford United last month

So I got Gary in at our place. He got the sack at Oxford after winning promotions at former clubs Aldershot and Wycombe. At Aldershot, he got a record 101 points to win the Conference title in 2008.

Hopefully his days out with us will keep his mood up and it won't be long before my former QPR team-mate returns to football management after his recent shock sacking.

Wherever he goes I've got no doubt he will build a promotion-winning team.

FALLEN AT THE FIRST HURDLE

One game into the season – and the Premier League hasn't even kicked off yet – and we have our first man down in the managerial sack race.

Mark Robins paid the price for Huddersfield losing 4-0 at home to Bournemouth. That is an awful feeling in front of your own fans and it leaves you demoralised.

However, their opponents Bournemouth finished last season very well and will be close to joining the top flight at the end of the season.

They will spank many teams home and away this season. Which I guess, when he wakes up this morning with no job to go to, will be no consolation to Mark.

Gone already: Mark Robins has left Huddersfield Town after just one match of the Championship season

HARRY, HARRY, HARRY

As I was driving to work one beautiful sunny morning I saw signs warning of traffic because of a Hare Krishna festival.

It reminded me of an old Boy George track. Believe it or not he was one of my favourites.

The last track on one of his CDs is called Bow Down Mister which is about Hare Krishnas.

All the way through, he sings: 'Harry, Harry, Harry' - well, that's what it sounds like.

Seeing the funny side: Harry Redknapp enjoyed Boy George's singing of his name

One year at West Ham, we'd just lost away and were on the coach back. Our manager Harry Redknapp wasn't too happy.

He was sat on the front seat, so I gave the driver the CD and asked him to play track 20 and turn the volume up all the way.

I hid in the back corner of the bus as Boy George rattled out the chorus 'Harry, Harry, Harry.' We were all in fits of laughter as Harry turned around and grinned.

 

ALLEN'S ANALYSIS

The player I keep hearing about...

Newcastle United have got a great deal for Jamaal Lascelles.

When I saw Nottingham Forest play at Reading's Madejski Stadium on New Year's Day I made a note of a young centre-back.

He was quick, could pass well and was composed on the ball. He played with an elegance about him.

In the last minute of the game, the score tied at 1-1, Reading had a free kick. They piled everyone into the box for the 40-yard up-and-under into the mixer.

Lascelles was there surrounded by bustling Reading centre forwards, their tall centre-backs and the big units of the team.

New club: Talented defender Jamaal Lascelles has moved to Newcastle United from Nottingham Forest 

Great business: Alan Pardew has brought in Lascelles (left) and goalkeeper Karl Darlow (right) from Forest though the pair are set to remain at the City Ground on loan for the season ahead

As the ball floated in the lad – under pressure from five of them – ignored the carnage, leapt into the air and headed it 30 yards from the goal.

I circled his name and knew he would be one to sign. Since then he's one people keep talking about. It's another great bit of business by Alan Pardew.

One thing I'd change about.... Substitutes.

With seven subs now sitting on the bench, changes should be made to the rules so that two of those must be homegrown players that have been at the club for at least three years.

It's about time changes were made. This would hopefully give more opportunities to promote our young English players coming through.

On top of that, I think five subs should be allowed to enter the field of play. Why only restrict it to three, when you've got seven sitting on the bench? It's seems pointless.

The big issue...

What a nightmare at Blackpool – or is it?

My old hometown club Reading were days from going bust towards the end of last season after someone pulled their money out after promises of fortunes being paid into the club.

They were in a precarious position and after being so well-run over the years it was a shock for all Reading fans.

Testing times: Blackpool are a club in crisis as fans protest against hated owner Karl Oyston

Scratch team: Blackpool manager Jose Riga managed to scramble together a team at the last moment to face Nottingham Forest on Saturday

Well Karl Oyston, the Blackpool owner, runs a club with no debt, and have put a team together without having to pay players in June and July.

It's a smart move. Rather than the start of summer when players and agents are demanding ridiculous sums, by getting them so close to the start of the season they can call the shots.

The debts at most clubs in the Championship are huge. I can understand why Blackpool supporters were getting angry, but you have to ask yourself, do we want to be another Portsmouth or Hereford?
