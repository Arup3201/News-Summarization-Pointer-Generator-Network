A Sotheby's executive yesterday told how she felt ‘violated’ after being seduced out of £800,000 by a benefits-claiming conman posing as a Goldman Sachs billionaire.

Harvard-educated Nina Siegenthaler, 37, fell for the sophisticated charms and 'A-list acting skills' of former Charterhouse schoolboy and Cambridge University drop-out Alistair Stewart.

She branded him a sociopath and said she had believed his ‘countless lies’ about being a hedge fund manager with properties worldwide.

Target: Nina Siegenthaler with her daughter on the beach. She fell in love with Stewart before he defrauded her

She gave him her £630,000 life savings to invest, plus £154,000 for him to rent a luxury home for them in the Caribbean.

In
reality, Stewart was orchestrating his fraud from a council flat in 
Burgess Hill, West Sussex, where he lived for most of the time on 
incapacity benefits.

He blew
almost all her cash in four months on a £55,000 Mercedes, private jets,
stays at the Ritz and Hyde Park Tower hotels, chauffeur-driven shopping
trips to Harrods and jaunts in helicopters.

Yesterday,
as 53-year-old Stewart was jailed for five-and-a-half years at the Old 
Bailey, Miss Siegenthaler called him a ‘cunning predator’.

She said: ‘He is one of the most intelligent, charismatic and seemingly generous people I have met.

‘He
is also a cunning predator,  a man without conscience or moral compass.
His ultimate aim is not to rob, though he certainly will do that, but 
to control and manipulate.’

Smooth criminal: Nina was duped Cambridge dropout Alistair Stewart who swindled her of more than £600,000 by posing as a retired Goldman Sachs billionaire

She
pre-recorded the message which she felt unable to deliver in person in 
court because she was still too ‘shocked and traumatised’ to see him in 
the flesh.

She said: ‘His insatiable desire to dupe leaves a path of destruction in its wake.

‘I experienced a profound sense of violation on many levels.’

Stewart targeted her by pretending to 
be interested in buying two properties worth more than £10million in the
Caribbean tax haven of the Turks and Caicos Islands where Miss 
Siegenthaler is vice-president of Sotheby’s International Realty.

After catching her at a vulnerable 
time during the breakdown of her marriage to the father of her young 
daughter, he spent six months grooming her on Skype, during which time 
she fell in love with him.

She also agreed to let him ‘invest’ her life savings after he said her daughter’s future would be in jeopardy if she refused.

Luxury: Hartling House, a 9,000-square foot villa on the island of Providenciales, which Stewart, posing as a retired Goldman Sachs millionaire, pretended he wanted to buy

After receiving the cash, he flew to 
visit her – on a £4,800 first class plane ticket – and bought her a 
£31,000 watch as a gift.

She described him as ‘completely convincing’, adding: ‘I never met someone who could fabricate so proficiently.

‘He told detailed stories about his 
alleged tenure with Goldman Sachs. None of it was true.’ He also 
invented a wife who had tragically died, a fictional daughter, and lied 
that he  had leukaemia.

But after finally becoming suspicious,
she investigated and discovered he had previously been convicted of 
four charges of fraud, including fleecing a 73-year-old woman out of 
£27,000.

When she confronted him he told her: ‘I lie as easily as I breathe.’

Nathaniel Rudolf, defending, said Stewart had repaid the £92,470 that was left of the money.

Home: The housing association block of flats in Burgess Hill, West Sussex where Stewart lived while pretending to run a hedge fund in Switzerland

After her ordeal at the hands of Alistair Stewart, Nina Siegenthaler has urged women to look for the tell-tale signs that the man they're dating may be sociopath to avoid suffering her fate:

The list was compiled by Donna Andersen for in her book, Red Flags of Love Fraud and can be seen on her website Lovefraud.com.
