A man has told how he had to have his buttocks sewn together after repeated surgery for a painful medical condition.

The man, known only as TBoneTheOriginal, posted his story - on the site Reddit.

Readers were so intrigued by his post - entitled 'I have no butt crack' - that he has been answering questions ever since, including that all 
important question, that he 'poops just like anyone else'.

TBone explained that he'd needed the surgery to sew his buttocks together after being diagnosed with severe pilonidal cysts.

These are painful boils that occur at the end of the tailbone or between the buttocks.

It's unclear why they occur, but it's  generally thought they are caused by loose hairs that push into the skin.

Certain things can increase 
the chances of developing a pilonidal cyst, such as being obese, 
having a large amount of body hair and having a job that involves a lot 
of sitting or driving.

TBone added: 'I've had multiple surgeries on it [the cyst] and instead of the usual procedure 
which involves letting it heal, mine was so bad that a plastic surgeon 
had to close it up. But they keep coming back, and it'll probably just 
get worse as I age'.

After several operations, his surgeon decided to close the space eight years ago to try and prevent the problem from recurring.

Later, he added:  'I'm married, and she's cool with it' - and to someone else who thought they might have the condition: 'Get it checked NOW. Mine got this bad because I kept putting it off.'

He added that flair-ups could be 
prevented by 'not sitting too long on hard surfaces'.

Earlier this month, a man who claims to suffer from an extremely rare medical condition in which he was born with two penises has posted a picture on the site, attracting thousands of questions.

The anonymous man - who goes by the moniker 'DoubleD*ckDude' - claimed to suffer from a condition known as diphallia.

This is where a boy is born with two fully-functioning penises, each capable of operating independently from the other - and included two pictures with the time and date.
