A yoga teacher is trying to change the face of the discipline and in the process says she has found a new self-awareness… by deliberately gaining 40lbs.

Trina Hall, a yoga instructor based in Dallas Texas, embarked on a diet she describes as ‘see it, eat it’ to gain the weight, and blogged about her experience

The 34–year-old began to gain weight after hearing a friend and fellow yogi crying over her fear about been known as the ‘fat yoga teacher’.

Trina had a healthy, moderate diet and was a typically slim, fit yoga instructor before she began her project, and believed she didn't really care about her weight

Trina, who has taught yoga for over six 
years, says on her blog: ‘I was taken aback by this statement because I 
would classify her as beautiful, fit, and trim. I wanted to explore her 
statement.

‘I thought this would be an experiment in empowering people to love their bodies and not try to fit society’s mould.’

Instead of her usual health-conscious diet, she told US News she began to eat exactly what she pleased - which included plenty of Mexican food

At 5ft 5in, Trina’s weight soon rose from around 130lbs to about 170lbs, a move which she admits might be thought of as ‘career suicide’.

'I want to slay the notion that people who do yoga need to look like the beauties on the cover of magazines’ Trina explains. 

However, rather than the reaction of others to her changing shape, which Trina says was minimal, it was the effect of the weight gain on her own sense of self-worth that had the most impact.

On her blog she explains: ‘Guilt from eating foods I typically considered bad for me were constant companions in my thoughts. 

‘The stories I made up about what people thought of me were changing and I was emotionally affected. Suddenly, my self-worth was proving to be connected to how good I looked wearing spandex – something I completely denied caring about before this experiment – and that pissed me off. 

Tina admits: ‘My most shocking discovery through the process is that I’m afraid of not being loved. I noticed the self-talk was that my beauty is only on the surface. I feared no man would want me this way and that I would die alone, probably from choking on a potato chip.’

Tina ended her experiment in July and has resumed her usual healthy diet.

However she has refused to weigh herself - and insists she has not given up Mexican food!

When asked what lessons she had learned from her experiment she told US News: ‘I thought my identity was about how I treated people and the actions I took to make the world a better place. But those things were only a piece of my identity.

‘I learned that I was – and still am – very judgmental about physical appearance. I was afraid of dying alone – I noticed that was a thought coming into my mind.

‘I'm single, and the thought kept coming in, "You're going to die alone. You're going to die alone."

‘And so I started to see that I had that thought process, that fear of not being loved, even when I weighed much less.’
