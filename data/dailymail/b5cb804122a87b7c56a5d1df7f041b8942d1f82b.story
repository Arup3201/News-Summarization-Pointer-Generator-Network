David Cameron arrived in Brazil today on a trip aimed at boosting the British economy – and was immediately asked about Boris Johnson.

The Prime Minister has taken a 40-strong trade delegation to Sao Paulo in the hope of drumming up business while holding talks with president Dilma Rousseff.

But all the Brazilian media want to discuss is the PM’s rivalry with the Mayor of London, who was beamed into millions of Brazilian homes when he handed over the Olympic and Paralympic flags ahead of the Rio Games in 2016.

Interviewed for newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, Mr Cameron was asked: ‘With the economy in crisis, we see mayor Boris Johnson, also of your party, with greater popularity than you to the point there are rumours that he might be the Conservative candidate for the next general election.

'Do you feel your post is threatened?’

However, the Prime Minister did his best to heap praise on his much-hyped leadership rival, insisting he did not feel the pressure.

‘Not at all. Boris has been a great friend of mine for a long time and a first-class mayor of London.

‘We're very lucky to have many big hitters in our party, but Boris still has much work to do as mayor, and so do I as Prime Minister.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson became a global star after handing over the Olympic and Paralympic flags to Mayor of Rio Eduardo Paes, leading Brazilian media to wonder if David Cameron felt threatened by his Tory rival

The two-day visit to Brazil is aimed at capitalising on the Olympic connection to foster trade links with one of the world’s emerging economic powerhouses.

It comes after his appearance on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman in which his knowledge of British history- including the meaning of the Magna Carta and who composed Rule Brittania – was shown to be lacking.

But he raised applause from the audience when he hailed the successful hosting of the Olympics and Paralympics this summer.

Today Mr Cameron officially opened a new £60million digger factory at Sorocaba, near Sao Paulo.

The 350,000 square foot JCB factory will assemble the yellow excavators and diggers for the Brazilian market, providing £100 million a year in orders for components from JCB plants in Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Wales.

Mr Cameron said: ‘This visit is about British jobs, British growth and the British economy, because I want Britain to be tied up to the fastest growing economies on the planet.

‘Brazil is now a top six economy and this visit is about safeguarding and creating 3,000 jobs back at home.

‘Here we are in JCB, a great British brand now expanding in Brazil. That's going to mean £100 million of extra orders from the UK and that's good for British jobs, tying us to the fast growing economies of the future.’

Mr Cameron was welcomed by Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, who offered him a coveted invitation to the opening match of the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil,

Mr Cameron joked noted that football was 'a sport invented in Britain but perhaps perfected in Brazil'.
