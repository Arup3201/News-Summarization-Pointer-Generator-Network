It has been just two weeks since Darryn Lyons, a former celebrity photographer famous for pink hair and enhanced abs, was elected mayor of his hometown.

However his transformation from paparazzi to politician appeared complete yesterday as he shook hands with the country's new Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.

He looked particularly dapper in a blue-pinstripe suit and matching silk tie and shirt as he shook Mr Abbot's hand inside Parliament House in Canberra.

While he has appeared on reality TV shows, including I'm a Celebrity and Big Brother sporting a signature pink Mohican, that has now been dyed a more officious-looking blonde colour.

On November 25th 48-year-old Lyons won the Mayoral post in Geelong taking 29.9 per cent of the primary vote.

The Liberal party member took 70,795 votes after preferences, ahead of his nearest challenger Stephanie Asher by more than 12,600 votes.

When he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that 'every election needs a comedy candidate,' reported The Age.

His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion and change,' and he publicised his message with adverts, T-shirts, and a stream of public appearances. Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades - he arrived in London aged 22.

In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World.

In 2011 he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother during which time bragged of his bedroom antics with a series of famous faces.

He even claimed to having spent the night with 12 girls at the same time.

Lyons also appeared on Chanel 5's Celebrity Big Brother in 2010 alongside Sally Bercow, wife of House of Commons Speaker John Bercow

The paparazzo told model Bobby Sabel: 'I once shared a bed with 12 girls. Those were the crazy days.'

On the Channel Five programme in which he came in sixth place, he also debuted his surgically-sculpted six pack.

The £4,000 procedure sees fat sucked out of specific areas of the torso to make it look as if the patient has super-toned abdominal muscles without ever hitting the gym.

Talking about the procedure, Mr Lyons said: 'I had contouring done to my body.

'I had to get really fit and lose a fair bit of weight. It takes away all the fat around it and actually lets your natural abs be there.

'Basically it's the male version of a boob job.'

Big Pictures went into administration last year with a string of debts, leaving 21 of his London-based staff without jobs.

But back in Australia Mr Lyons set up Mr Paparazzi Celebrity Deals and established himself as a shareholder of another firm called BPGG Limited – which promptly bought up the assets of Big Pictures from the administrators for £164,000.

He appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in 2012 and has also appeared on a series of television shows - including the Australian version of Dragons’ Den and an ITV reality series about the magazine business called Deadline.
