 A 34-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a 27-year old woman after her two young children found her body in a car at Hackham West on Sunday.

The children, aged seven and two, were quick to alert neighbours by sounding the car horn once they realised their mother was unresponsive.

A man hunt for the woman’s partner led to the arrest of a Hackam West local who police say was known to the victim.

The man was refused bail and will appear in the Cristies Beach Magistrates Court later today.

A neighbour who was one of the first to respond to the children’s alert told The Advertiser she heard ‘bloodcurdling screams’ at about 4am Sunday morning.

She said she heard the couple arguing earlier that night and on occasion had to ask them to keep the noise down.

Investigations are underway with a 34-year-old man being arrested for the 27-year-old's murder 

Police are investigating the domestic dispute and are treating the death as suspicious.

It has been reported that police believe there was no weapon used to kill the woman who was found on the passenger side of her Holden Captiva, however, no official information has been released about the woman’s cause of death.

Neighbours say they have heard domestic disputes from inside the home
