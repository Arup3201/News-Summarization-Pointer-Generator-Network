Bed-blocking  has reached record levels as thousands of healthy people fill hospital wards needed for sick patients, official figures reveal.

Hospital beds were taken up on more than 1 million days in the last 12 months - a 19 per cent increase on the year before.

The problem - which is caused by delayed discharges - is now costing the NHS an estimated £287million a year.

In January alone, the latest month for which figures are available, discharges from hospital were delayed for a total 103,776 days, according to NHS England records.

It is the first time the figure has risen over 100,000 since records began in 2010.

A bed in a hospital costs the NHS a basic £275 per day with medicines and other care excluded, according to Department of Health figures.

And with each delayed discharge lasting an average 28 days in January, the costs quickly mount up.

Successive governments have failed to deal with the problem of bed-blocking.

But with numbers of bed days lost to the issue having nearly doubled from 55,000 a month in August 2010 to more than 103,000 in January 2015, critics have accused the Coalition of losing grip of the issue.

Healthy patients are usually kept in hospital because they have nowhere else to go.

At Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge 18 per cent of acute inpatient beds were occupied last November by people whose discharge had been delayed

This is often because councils do not have a space in a care home to take them to, or because a care package has not yet been set up in their own home.

Labour yesterday blamed the escalation of the problem on cuts to social care budgets, which have been reduced by £3.5billion since 2010.

A leading doctor recently warned that the lack of available council care risked bringing the NHS 'to its knees'.

At Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge 18 per cent of acute inpatient beds were occupied last November by people whose discharge had been delayed.

Dr Susan Robinson, an A&E consultant at the hospital, said in November: 'If we' re crowded it's because the hospital's crowded, and the hospital's crowded because they can't get patients out.

'The crowded hospital is almost bringing us to our knees.'

NHS England statistics show that from February 2014 to January 2015 1,042,434 bed days were lost due to patients being unable to be discharged.

For the same period last year 873,415 days were lost.

King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham told the Independent on Sunday: 'Many delayed transfers of care are caused by problems accessing other parts of the NHS, such as community and mental health services, while increasing pressures on social care are also a factor.

'The solution must be sought in better co-ordination and adequate funding both for the NHS and social care.'

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: 'Back in 2010 I said it would be irresponsible to safeguard the NHS budget if the way you pay for it is by raiding social care. This Parliament has borne that out completely. Care costs are the root cause of the A&E crisis.

'In their Budget assessment the Office for Budget Responsibility said there would be a 'rollercoaster' in 2016-17 and 2017-18 – far deeper cuts than we have seen in this parliament. '

The Department of Health said that although delayed transfers have risen, hospital admissions have risen faster.

A spokesman said: 'In fact, proportionally fewer patients are being delayed in hospital as the NHS helps record numbers of patients.

'We've given a record £700million this winter for thousands more NHS staff and beds, alongside £37m for local authorities to help more people go home from hospital promptly.

'We're also bringing health and social care services together for the first time next month to further reduce A&E admissions and get people out of hospital more quickly.'
