Pricey: Tottenham's £1895 season ticket costs supporters £90.24 per match

Sum: Arsenal's most expensive season ticket costs over £2000, but includes seven cup matches

Arsenal's loyal fans, meanwhile, will pay up to £78 per game this season.

The
 most expensive Emirates Stadium season-ticket costs a whopping £2013, 
but it includes seven cup fixtures in addition to all 19 Premier League 
matches. That works out at £77.42 per game over the course of a season.

Chelsea's £1250 season ticket is just for Premier League matches, meaning each Premier League game costs £65.79.

But,
 while supporters of London's top clubs fork out huge sums for their 
season tickets, fans of Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool
 only pay an equivalent of less than £50 per game.

West Brom season ticket holders, meanwhile, only have to pay a maximum of £24.16.

This
 is after more than half of Premier League clubs have hiked 
season-ticket prices — despite cashing in on the latest TV deal worth 
£5.5billion over three years.

The
 Football Supporters’ Federation (FSF) are planning a march in protest 
and their chairman Malcolm Clarke said: ‘Nine out of 10 fans already 
think they are paying too much for tickets and these figures only back 
that point of view.

‘Clubs
 are swimming in cash and the last media deal was worth £5bn. The huge 
increase would have been enough for clubs to let every fan in for free 
and they would have been no worse off.

Bargain: West Brom's most expensive season ticket works out at just £24.16 per game

‘Top-flight
 clubs need to think long-term and cut prices. Never mind all the clever
 PR strategies clubs come out with, nothing would earn goodwill like 
dropping prices.

‘The FSF will lead a march on Premier League and Football League HQ on August 14. We would encourage all fans to join us.’

With
 clubs out to maximise revenues to be able to compete in the Premier 
League within the constraints of Financial Fair Play, fans are once 
again paying increased prices and 13 sides have raised season-ticket 
prices this season.

The
 biggest price hikes have been made by Burnley and QPR, both promoted 
last season — Burnley have raised the price of their cheapest season 
ticket prices by a whopping 47 per cent. Substantial rises have also 
been announced at Stoke and Hull.

*Includes seven cup matches*** Includes two cup matches

Burnley
 chief executive Lee Hoos has defended the increases by pointing out 
that fans able to watch Premier League football this season and because 
£100 from this year’s season-ticket price will go towards the 2015/16 
season tickets when fans renew.

With the Premier League acknowledged as the most lucrative in the world, only two clubs have lowered prices this season.

Football for some fans in the North East has come down in price after Mike Ashley announced marginal price cuts at Newcastle and Sunderland kept their prices down, too.

Arsenal have instigated three per cent price rises in line with inflation, taking their most expensive season-ticket prices above the £2,000 mark, the highest in the league.

Arsenal also have the most expensive low-cost season ticket, priced at £1,014, which, with the exception of Tottenham and Chelsea, is more costly than every other clubs’ most expensive ticket.

Despite winning the league last term, Manchester City have frozen the cost of their cheapest season tickets at £299 — the cheapest in the Premier League — although the club have announced a 10 per cent rise on the most expensive season tickets at the Etihad to £860.
