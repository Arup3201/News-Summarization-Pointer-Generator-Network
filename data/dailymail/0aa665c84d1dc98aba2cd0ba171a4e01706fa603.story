Mark Clattenburg is used to a frosty reception from football fans but even he struggled with the Arctic-like conditions as West Brom hosted Manchester City on Boxing Day.

Christmas came a day late at The Hawthorns as the snow fell heavily in the Midlands during the Baggies' Premier League encounter against the Champions.

And while the visitors got the perfect festive gift with goals from Fernando, Yaya Toure and David Silva sealing a 3-1 win, Clattenburg would have wished Santa brought him some extra layers to wear as he refereed proceedings.

The 39-year-old was left visibly shivering as he officiated the match much to the amusement of City star Frank Lampard.

Lampard, a second half substitute, enjoyed a light-hearted joke during the game with Clattenburg as the snow descended thicker in the second half with the ball barely visible  at times.

And despite the difficult conditions, Clattenburg's judgement was spot on as he awarded Manuel Pellegrini's side an early first half penalty after Silva was fouled by former team-mate Joleon Lescott. Toure stepped up to the spot and duly converted to put City 2-0 ahead on 13 minutes.

Clattenburg who is likely to officiate a top-flight match on Sunday, will be hoping to do so in warmer conditions than the Boxing Day .
