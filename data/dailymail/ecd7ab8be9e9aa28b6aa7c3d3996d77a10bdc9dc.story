You can see how it might cause confusion.

Faced with the choice of just two candidates in a local election, many voters would plump for the name of the sitting councillor. But the electorate in the Great Bridge ward in Sandwell, West Midlands, will need to be a little more careful than they might have expected.

The Tories have selected a candidate who not only bears a passing resemblance to Labour councillor Derek Rowley... he shares exactly the same name as well.

The Labour group has accused its political rival of using 'dirty tricks' to try to unseat their Derek.

The 60-year-old candidate, who has 
been a councillor since 2004, said: 'This is clearly a stunt by the 
Conservative party to subvert the democratic process.

'They just want to confuse the voters 
by putting someone with the same name as me on the ballot paper â€“ it's 
just dirty tricks to try to sabotage the election.

'The other Derek Rowley hasn't been campaigning at all.

'He hasn't handed out any leaflets, 
there are no posters and he hasn't knocked on a single door. The Tories 
are trying to defraud and confuse voters.'

The Tory Derek, who is ten years older than his namesake, remained tight-lipped about his candidacy yesterday.

But the leader of the Conservatives on Sandwell Council, Ray Nock, was quick to deny his party had done anything wrong.

He said: 'These accusations are total nonsense.

'Our Derek lives in the area and has been a member of our party for ages. Labour is just clutching at straws.'

But some local residents remained 
sceptical. Ethel Hardy, 70, said: 'It's easy for us older people to get a
bit flustered in the ballot box.

'With two people of the same name presented to you many people will be getting confused.'

Andy Court, 35, added: 'If you choose the first Derek Rowley you see, you might vote for the wrong person.'
