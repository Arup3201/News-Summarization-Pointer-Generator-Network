For the second  day in a row, there has been a blast at an industrial plant in Louisiana's Ascension Parish.

The incident today occurred at CF Industries in Donaldsville, Louisiana which manufactures nitrogen products. One man was killed, and seven injured, when an 18-wheeler carrying nitrogen was pressuring another vessel and caused an explosion around 6:15 P.m. on Friday.

Ronald 'Rocky' Morris, 55, was killed in the blast. Morris, who had been working at the plant for 30 years, died instantly. Seven others were injured and taken to a local hospital where they are all in fair or stable condition.

Nitrogen blast: The blast happened shortly after 6 p.m. on Friday at the CF Industries plant in Donaldsville, Louisiana

Second blast: This was the second deadly blast in two days in the same parish in Louisiana. On Thursday a larger explosion happened in Geismar, killing one and injuring 70

Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeff Wiley likened the blast to a 'balloon popping.' Plant manager Lou Frey said that reports that there was an explosion were wrong since 'there was no fire or chemical release nor is there any threat or hazard posed to the community,' Frey said in a press conference. 

So far though, they don't know what exactly went wrong.

'We do not know exactly what happened, but we don want to find out what happened,' Frey said. ' It's very important to us, but we don't have the details.'

The fertilizer plant, run by CF Industries based in Deerfield, Illinois, had some violations in the past with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. They ere fined $150,000 for safety adn health violations after a fire and explosion at the plant killed three people in 2000. The violation cited 12 violations which posed 'substantial probability' of serious injury or death.

Geismar explosion: The blast Thursday was much larger, and actually caused a fire at the plant. The blast at CF Industries was described as being like a 'balloon popping'

Back to back blasts: With two deadly blasts in two days, many are concerned about oversight at the Louisiana plants

Yesterday a much larger explosion happened at nearby Williams Olefins chemical plant in Geismar, which is just 30 miles away from Donaldsville in the same parish. That explosion killed two people and injured more than 70 others.

In a press conference after the CF Industries blast, Wiley commented on the tragic two day events.

'The irony of back-to-back incidents has not escaped us. We express our sincere condolences to the families of the deceased and injured.'
