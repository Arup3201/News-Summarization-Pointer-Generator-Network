Mother-of-three Tracey Smalley is celebrating an amazing weight loss achievement after shedding fifteen stone in six years.

The primary school chef from Nottingham, who was affectionately known as 'Big Trace' by colleagues and friends, lost the weight after having a gastric band fitted and now weighs just 12 stone.

Tracey started to put on weight after having children, now aged 28, 27 and 13 and says that she 
tried every diet she had heard of in an effort to be thinner but finally underwent gastric band surgery after doctors told her she would die if she continued to grow.

Tracey Smalley has lost 15 stone in weight since having a gastric band fitted and now fits in to size 12 clothes

Just after her 40th birthday, medics told Tracey that she needed to lose 10 stone - or risk dying before she was 50.

She tried a series of crash diets and even weight loss pills, but despite successfully losing small amounts Tracey always piled the pounds back on.

Tracey had a gastric band fitted five years ago in a last-ditch attempt to slim down to a healthy weight.

After the surgery, Tracey's size dropped dramatically, and she now weighs 12 stone and fits in to a dress size 12/14.

Tracey, who works at Forest Fields Primary School, Nottingham, said: 'After I had the three kids I just started putting the weight on.

'I'm not a lazy person, any one that knows me knows I'm not idle but I suppose my diet didn't help.

'I'm guilty of snacking on things at home, but whatever I tried to do to lose weight it didn't work.

'And I really did try, I don't want people to think that I didn't try different ways to lose weight, but I'm not going to say that I've never eaten chocolate or fatty foods, because I have.

Tracey worked as a cook at Forest Fields Primary School but says she never ate at work, despite being surrounded by food

'I feel better now, the doctors said to me "if you don't lose 10 stone you'll be dead soon".

'I thought that I wanted to get more out of life so I decided to lose the weight any way I could.

'The idea of not being there for my three kids was unbearable, I did it for them as much as myself.

'It might sound strange but I never ate at work. Even though I was surrounded by food I never got hungry.

'It used to gorge on chocolate and crisps when I got home from work and the weight just piled on and on.'

Though her surgery was paid for by the NHS, Tracey had to spend £7,350 of her own cash to have excess saggy skin removed from her arms and stomach.

She is now saving up to have a procedure on her legs so that they match her new body shape.

According to the Department of Health, a gastric banding - where a band is used to reduce the size of the stomach - can cost anywhere between £5,000 and £8,000.

A gastric bypass - where the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach - costs between £9,500 and £15,000.
