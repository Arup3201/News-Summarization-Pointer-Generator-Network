This is the hilarious moment teachers surprised schoolchildren by bursting into a choreographed version of Let It Go from Frozen at a church service.

Groups of teachers popped up from seats around the church to join in with the flashmob-style performance to the delight of the school's 750 children.

Headteacher Paul Howieson kicked things off by dramatically reading the first verse aloud at the festivities for Baden-Powell and St Peter's Church of England Junior School in Poole, Dorset.

Wearing Santa hats and other festive accessories, around 60 teachers took part and even the rector, Reverend Michael Camp, had a starring role in the performance.

Teachers surprised schoolchildren by bursting into a choreographed version of Let It Go from Frozen at a church service

They had been working on the musical treat for three weeks and held several secret rehearsals at the school.

'We have been working on the performance for the last three weeks and did two or three rehearsals in the church and several at school.

'We had to close the curtains and pretend nothing was going on but it worked. I don't think anybody had any idea what we were up to.

'I read the first verse and the kids started to stir by the third word and by the time I got to the line 'looks like I'm the queen' they were laughing. Their reaction was extraordinary.

'I think it's good for them to see their teachers in a different way, and see we like a laugh as much as anyone.

'And it was great to get Revd Michael involved too. It's a really positive association with the church for the kids.

'We're a big school so getting everyone together for a rehearsal was not very easy but we did it and we managed to keep it a secret.

'All the parents said how great they thought it was.'

The school surprises the children with a performance each year, but this was the first time they had performed live and Mr Howieson said it was their best yet.

Let It Go is one of the most popular songs from Disney's 2013 hit Frozen, which is the most successful animated film ever made.

It is also the fifth highest-grossing film in box office history after taking £723million.

The song is performed by Queen Elsa, who has a magical ability to create and control ice and is voiced by Idina Menzel.
