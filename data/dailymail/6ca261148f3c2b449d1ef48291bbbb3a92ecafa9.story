Amanda Bynes ignited her trousers and screamed her dog had been burned after allegedly starting a fire on Monday night in a residential driveway.

The 27-year-old actress was found by sheriff's deputies about 9pm standing near the fire burning at a house in Thousand Oaks, California, said Captain Don Aguilar of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department on Tuesday.

The sheriff's department and fire department both responded to an emergency 911 call of a gasoline tank fire in a driveway, Aguilar said.

Fire incident: Amanda Bynes, pictured in July in New York City, has been placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold after allegedly starting a fire in a residential driveway in Thousand Oaks, California

The homeowner said deputies later identified the woman as Amanda and said she had burned a part of her own clothing.

'It sounded like her clothing had been sort of singed,' the resident told TMZ.

A
passerby named Andrew Liverpool said he was driving along when he saw a
woman with her 'left pant leg on fire' and after he pulled over saw the
woman grab her small dog.

Amanda tried to leave in a taxi, but Liverpool said he kept the cab from leaving.

'She was really frantic and she was like "my dog has been burned,"' Liverpool said.

A
male caller to 911 reported a piece of cloth burning on a gasoline tank
on a driveway and a second female caller confirmed a gasoline tank and 
fire, according to a report in TMZ.

Amanda was questioned by Ventura County Sheriff's Department deputies who determined she met the criteria for a psychaitric hold and she was detained, Aguilar said.

The 5150 hold is named after the California state code that allows for involuntary hospitalisation for a mental health evaluation.

A person can be held against their will for up to 72 hours under such a hold. 

Deputies asked the homeowner if she knew a shorter woman with 'fuzzy blonde hair and carrying a chihuahua' or any reason why a person would set fire to her driveway, the woman told TMZ.

Authorities told the woman that a young lady carrying a 'little red gas tank' had lit a fire in her driveway.

Amanda's
parents, Rick and Lynn, are considering going to a judge to seek 
conservatorship of Amanda, but must act to take legal control quickly 
before she is released from her psychiatric hold, a source told RadarOnline.

And according to TMZ, they are refusing to pay for the fire damage their daughter allegedly caused, saying: 'Amanda needs to pay for it.'

Amanda was born and raised in affluent Thousand Oaks, which is about 35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

She was forced to return home to Southern California after she went broke and was unable to find a place to live in New York City, according to RadarOnline.

Odd outing: Amanda shopped in a blonde wig and long T-shirt at Bloomingdales in Santa Monica hours before she was involuntarily hospitalised for a mental evaluation

The decision for Amanda to return to Los Angeles 'was made because she
had run out of money she had access to. Amanda was unable to find any 
place to live in New York City because of her bizarre behavior,' a 
source told the website.

'No one would rent an apartment to her. She does own a house in 
Calabasas (California). It’s unclear how she got to California from New 
York.' The source also said she does not carry a valid drivers license in
either state.

Shopping spree: Amanda shopping hours before being hospitalised involuntarily

Meanwhile, Amanda was pictured in a disheveled state just hours before being placed on involuntary psychiatric hold.

She was seen shopping in Bloomingdales in Santa Monica on Monday in a matted blonde wig, a long T-shirt and flip-flops.

Amanda will not face any criminal charges related to the driveway fire that prompted her involuntary confinement, Aguilar said.

Emergency medical responders were at the scene, but there were no injuries and no medical aide was rendered, Aguilar said.

Amanda's listed attorneys in an industry database, Richard Hutton and David Feldman, declined to comment on Tuesday to The Associated Press.

Amanda underwent a psychiatric 
evaluation in May after being arrested in New York City for 
investigation of drug possession and alleged evidence tampering for 
throwing a bong out of her high-rise window.

Pop singer Britney Spears was infamously placed on a 5150 hold in 2008 after a public mental breakdown.

The move to hospitalise Britney came 
after months of erratic behaviour, including a head-shaving incident, 
speaking in a British accent and other bizarre incidents.

Amanda has her own lengthy list of odd behaviour.

She
was recently evicted from her suite at a Ritz-Carlton hotel in New York
City after allegedly smoking marijuana in her room and racking up a 
$2,000 room service bill.

The
former All That star also has frequently lashed out at a wide variety 
of different celebrities on Twitter, ranging from Lance Bass to Jason 
Biggs.

Her odd behaviour commenced with her retirement from acting and move to New York.

She shaved her head and displayed bizarre antics earlier this spring while at a New York City hair salon for hours with her sunglasses on.

Amanda also was photographed in New York smoking suspicious looking cigarettes and reportedly was booted from her gym for smoking marijuana.

The Easy A star also has had several run-ins with the law in California.

Teen idol: Amanda, shown in 2001, was a popular actress on Nickelodeon

The Hairspray star in December resolved a hit-and-run case after entering into a civil settlement with the other drivers.

Prosecutors charged her last fall with driving on a suspended license after it was temporarily taken away from her following two hit-and-run cases where she was accused of leaving the scene without providing proper information.

She has also pleaded not guilty to drunken driving in a separate case.

Amanda was one of the biggest actors on children's television for about a decade.

She won four straight Kids Choice Awards for best television actress starting in 2000 for her roles in the ensemble variety show All That and for her own vehicle The Amanda Show.

The also received Kids Choice Awards for best movie actress for her roles in Big Fat Liar and What A Girl Wants.
