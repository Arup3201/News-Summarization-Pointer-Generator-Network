Text addicts? American teenagers text 60 times a day, according to a new survey - up from 50 messages a day in 2009

American teenagers text 60 times a day, according to a new survey - up from 50 messages a day in 2009.

Among American teenagers aged 14-17, 31% have a smartphone.

Younger children, who are much less likely to own the devices - just 8% of those aged 12-13 have a smartphone in the U.S. in the report by Pew Research Centre.

The figure of 60 sms messages per day is for a 'median' text user - the 'middle' number in a series of statistics.

'Teens are fervent communicators,' says Pew.

'Straddling childhood and adulthood, they communicate frequently with a 
variety of important people in their lives: friends and peers, parents, 
teachers, coaches, bosses, and a myriad of other adults and 
institutions.

The figures are based on a survey of 799 teenagers chosen as 'nationally representative.

Precise figures for UK text-messaging aren't available, but UK teenagers are significantly more likely to own a smartphone.

A recent survey by Deloitte found that two-thirds of UK teenagers owned smartphones - although Deloitte's definition of smartphone, a handheld device with an open operating system, may differ from Pew's.

Deloitte says, 'Unlike the tablet computer, which seems universally appealing, younger age groups are much more likely to own smartphones.'
