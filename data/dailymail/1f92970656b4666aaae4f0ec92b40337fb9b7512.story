At least seven people have died after police and protesters clashed in central Cairo overnight after supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi  tried to block major thoroughfares crossing the River Nile.

A further 261 people have been injured after fights broke out between Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and locals shortly after 9pm and continued into early hours this morning.

Many people on all sides are now expressing their frustration and fear at the continued unrest in Egypt since Morsi was deposed on July 3.

The head of Egypt's emergency services Mohamed Sultan said two people had been killed at a bridge in central Cairo and five more in the capital's Giza district while senior Health Ministry official Khaled el-Khateib revealed that the number of people injured reached 261.

Scenes of running street battles close 
to the Egyptian Museum, one of the country's main tourist attractions, 
may raise further concerns about stability in the Arab world's most 
populous country.

Young men, their mouths covered to 
protect them from tear gas, threw stones at police and shouted pro-Morsi
and anti-military slogans, as well as 'Allahu Akbar!' meaning God is 
greatest.

Military helicopters hovered overhead
and police vans were brought in to quell the trouble, but when that 
didn't work, dozens of riot police moved in. Medics treated men with 
deep gashes to their eyes and faces nearby.

'I've had enough of this chaos,' said Ashraf Mohamed, who watched the clashes from a distance. 'Egypt is just rubbish.'

Mohamed's frustration echoed the view of
millions of Egyptians who rallied for Morsi's resignation on June 30. 
The military said it deposed him to fulfill the wish of the people. 
Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement said it was a coup.

'It's the army against the people, these are our soldiers, we have no weapons,' said Alaa el-Din, a 34-year-old computer engineer, clutching a laptop.

'The army is killing our brothers, you are meant to defend me and you are attacking me. The army turned against the Egyptian people.'

Tens
of thousands of Brotherhood supporters gathered late on Monday at the 
Rabaa Adawiya mosque in northeastern Cairo, where they have staged a 
sit-in vigil for the last three weeks vowing to stay until Mursi is 
reinstated.

Another large 
crowd rallied outside Cairo University, and there were protests in the 
coastal city of Alexandria and the Nile city of Assiut. There also were 
minor clashes in Giza, home of the pyramids, just outside Cairo.

The
army warned demonstrators that it would respond with 'the utmost 
severity and firmness and force' if they approached military bases or 'vital state institutes'.

No rest: Many people on both sides have expressed frustration at the ongoing clashes since Morsi was deposed

At 
least 92 people were killed in the days after Morsi was toppled, more 
than half of them shot by troops outside the Republican Guard compound 
near the Rabaa mosque on July 8. Protests since then had been tense but 
peaceful until Monday night.

The
political turmoil and unrest in major cities has also fuelled violence 
in Egypt's lawless North Sinai province bordering Israel and the 
Palestinian Gaza Strip.

Attacks
in the area have killed 13 people, mainly police, since July 3. In the 
latest, suspected Islamist militants fired grenades at a bus carrying 
workers from a factory in the Sinai city of El Arish on Monday, killing 
three and wounding 17.

Egypt has become increasingly polarised by the crisis, but one thing the two sides share is a deep mistrust of the United States and its perceived role in the unrest.

It comes as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns told reporters in Cairo that Washington had no desire to meddle in Egypt, which it supports with $1.5 billion in aid each year, most of which goes to the military.

'Only Egyptians can determine their future,' Burns told reporters at the U.S. embassy. 'I did not come with American solutions. Nor did I come to lecture anyone. We will not try to impose our model on Egypt.'

Washington, never comfortable with the rise of the Islamist Brotherhood, has so far refused to say whether it views Morsi's removal as a coup, which would require it to halt aid.

The Islamist Nour Party and the Tamarud anti-Mursi protest movement both said they turned down invitations to meet Burns.

But a senior State Department official denied Burns had been shunned. 'I don't think we're losing influence at all,' the U.S. official said, adding that Burns was still in Cairo.

'I don't know what meetings he has, but he has seen a range of people in Cairo in the interim government, in civil society ... so it's hard to say he has been spurned by both sides. I don't accept that is the case.'

Morsi, meanwhile, is being held incommunicado at an undisclosed location. He has not been charged with a crime but the authorities say they are investigating him over complaints of inciting violence, spying and wrecking the economy. Scores of Morsi supporters were rounded up after violence last week.

Many of the top Brotherhood figures have been charged with inciting violence, but have not been arrested and are still at large. The public prosecutors' office announced new charges against seven Brotherhood and Islamist leaders on Monday. Burns had earlier called for restraint on both sides.

'If representatives of some of the largest parties in Egypt are detained or excluded, how are dialogue and participation possible?' he asked. He also urged those opposed to Mursi's ouster to participate in the political process peacefully.

Interim President Adli Mansour and his prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi head a transitional cabinet full of technocrats that is paving the way for parliamentary elections in around six months, in a bid to restore civilian rule.

U.S.-educated economist Ahmed Galal, as finance minister, has the task of rescuing an economy and state finances wrecked by two and a half years of turmoil.

That task became easier, at least in the short term, after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait - rich Gulf Arab states happy at the downfall of the Brotherhood - promised a total of $12 billion in cash, loans and fuel.

The new planning minister, Ashraf al-Arabi, said the Arab money would be enough to sustain Egypt through its transition period and it did not need to restart talks with the International Monetary Fund.

Egypt had sought $4.8 billion in IMF aid last year, but months of talks ran aground with the government unable to agree on cuts in unaffordable subsidies for food and fuel. Arabi's comments could worry investors who want the IMF to prod reform.

'I think it's inappropriate to be making such a strong statement, given how new he is to the position,' said Angus Blair, president of the Signet Institute, an economic think tank.
