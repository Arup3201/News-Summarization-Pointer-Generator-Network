This is the first picture of a British teenager who died after suffering a mysterious allergic reaction during a school trip to Tanzania.

Tragic Jack Burden, 18, was just two weeks into a month-long expedition in Africa with classmates when he suddenly fell into an anaphylactic shock.

Despite receiving immediate first aid and treatment with EpiPens - an emergency treatment for anaphylaxis - he could not be resuscitated.

Tragic: Jack Burden, 18, was just two weeks into a month-long expedition in Africa with classmates when he suddenly fell into an anaphylactic shock 

Yesterday Jack's father Steven and headmistress mum Alison said the family still did not know what had happened to the 'caring' teenager.

Steven said: 'We don't know what it was he had a reaction to yet. We're just waiting for the travel company to tell us what it was.'

The school boy's friends flooded social media to pay tribute to 'one of the kindest, most caring lads I could have wished to have met'.

Writing on Facebook Kieran Mckeith said: 'Absolutely devastated, Jack was easily one of the kindest, most caring lads I could have wished to have met, never had a bad word to say about anyone. Was an absolute pleasure knowing you, thoughts are with his family. RIP.'

Sammy Preston wrote: 'Can't believe the news I've woken up to. I've known you since I was 7, you were such a caring person and such an amazing friend not only to me but to so many other people. You were always there for me. It's absolutely heartbreaking knowing you’re gone and at such a young age too, but you'll always be in our hearts. RIP Jack Burden god always takes the best!'

In mourning: Sir Ken Gibson, executive headteacher at the college Jack attended, said he was 'devastated to hear the awful news'

While devastated Chlo Hobson added: 'Have woke up today with the most devastating news! Can't believe it, it just can't sink in! Rest in peace Jack Burden.

'Was so kind and funny, he never had a bad thing to say about anyone... I remember one Christmas a group of us spent a load of time together, and I started playing with your catapult when we were at your house and broke it, so I got you a special Christmas card with an elastic band in it.

'You were listed on Facebook as my brother and in school that's what you acted like. When I had trouble there and felt alone you weren't the person to walk past and say nothing, you'd make sure I was okay and ask if I was coming to class. Just can't believe it.

'Feel so selfish for not keeping in contact with you more since school. You'll be missed so much by everybody, your amazing personality has touched everybody. Love is going out to his family. RIP jack xxxxx.'

Jack was on a school expedition to the African country with a party from Harton Technology College, in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when the incident happened.

A spokesman for True Adventure, who led the trip, said the team had been completing a 28-day expedition trekking in southern Tanzania and working on a charity project

Sir Ken Gibson, executive headteacher at the college, said: 'We were devastated to hear the awful news about one of our sixth form students.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, and with the students and staff who are still in Tanzania.

'I have been in touch with the family and the parents of the other students, and will be keeping in close contact with the staff in Tanzania.

'We are hopeful that they will be flying home as soon as possible and we will have professional support in place for all concerned.'

A spokesman for True Adventure, who led the trip, said the team had been completing a 28-day expedition trekking in southern Tanzania and working on a charity project.

They had been on day 19 when the incident occurred.

They said: 'The True Adventure Operations Room in the UK were notified by satellite phone in the afternoon (UK time) of July 22 that one of the team had suffered an allergic reaction.

'The team's highly experienced and qualified expedition leader immediately administered CPR and EpiPens, but sadly they could not be resuscitated.

'The cause of the allergic reaction has not been confirmed.

'The Operations Room helped coordinate the team's evacuation from their remote location by organising for an ambulance with an international medical support agency doctor and a medic to meet them at the nearest road-head.

'The thoughts and condolences of all at True Adventure are with their family and friends and the organisation's efforts are fully focused on ensuring they are supported in any way possible.'

A spokeswoman for South Tyneside Council said: 'Our thoughts and sympathies are with his family and friends at this very sad time.

'We will be offering counselling and any other support that we can to those affected by this tragic incident.'
