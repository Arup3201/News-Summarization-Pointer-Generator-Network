This adorable set of images shows a group of playful bear cubs frolicking in the trees as their mother takes a well-earned nap.

British photographer Jules Cox, 44, snapped the brown bears chasing each other up tall pine trees, completely unaware they were being watched down the lens of a camera.

At just a few months old, the youngsters were already able to climb right to the top of the tallest tree in the great Kainuu wilderness, in Finland.

Meanwhile an exhausted mother bear snoozed on the ground below - and from the pictures of her offspring it is plain to see why she needs the rest.

Race you to the top! British photographer Jules Cox captured the cubs, who are just a few months old, dashing to the top of a tree 

Taking a well-earned nap: While the cubs clambered up the tall trees their mother took the chance to get some  sleep

Mr Cox, who has spent four seasons with the bears, saw them racing up the trees and hanging on to branches. 

The photographer, from Brighton, hid in the woods so he could catch the bears in their most natural form.

He said: 'It was an amazing sight to see the cubs climbing the tree.

'They have amazing climbing skills even at such a young age. 

'They are utterly fearless.'

The 39 stone (250kg) mother looks at ease while resting because the wilderness, which borders Russia, is a safe-haven for bears.

Up close and personal: Mr Cox, from Brighton, hid in the woods all day to take the perfect pictures of the bears in their natural environment

More than 95 per cent of Kainuu is wild forest, meaning the bears have very little contact with people.

Mr Cox said: 'At last light a cub climbed up a tree in shadow.

'Further up, the tree was still bathed in beautiful light. I encouraged him like something out of a bear version of Poltergeist.

'Just as the cub reached the patch of light he decided to come back down again. Only for the cub to change his mind again and shin up the tree again into the most beautiful patch of red light.

'I could have hugged the little fellow had it not been for his 250kg mother watching close by.'
