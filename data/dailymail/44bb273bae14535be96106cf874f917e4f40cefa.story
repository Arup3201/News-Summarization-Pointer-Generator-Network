An English Mastiff who veterinarians said couldn't have puppies has just delivered a litter of 18 miracle mutts.

The Suggs family of Holly Springs, Mississippi, were sad when a vet told them their three year old dog, Kimber, was unable to breed.

'She wasn't going to have any puppies,' Amy Suggs said of the 150lb pet, adding that because of the vet's prediction, she and her husband, Richard, 'weren't concerned with separating her from our male.'

But Kimber had other plans.

She and Magnum, the Suggs' male Mastiff, found love and before long she was pregnant.

And the surprises just kept coming.

Unable to get theÂ  dog onto the X-ray table because of her size, the vet estimated she was having 11 puppies.

So the Suggs began preparing for the mass delivery.

'I was really excited because of the experience and everything that goes along with having a litter,' Suggs told WTVA.

Last Thursday, the couple took Kimber to the vet because she looked to be unwell.

When they arrived there was another, scary surprise.

He told them he was going to perform an emergency c-section in an effort to save Kimber and save the puppies.

'I was an emotional basket-case,' Suggs said. 'I was just sitting in the waiting room not really knowing what was going on.'

Kimber nearly didn't make it, but thankfully the vet delivered the pups and some good news - they were all fine and healthy, along with their mom.

However, he also delivered perhaps the biggest surprise of all - that Kimber's 11 puppies were in fact 18.

'I laughed and thought he was playing and picking at me,' Suggs said. 'But he was telling the truth. We had 18 puppies.'

The Suggs are pitching in to help the busy mother care for her enormous litter, bottle feeding the pups every three hours as Kimber recovers from the c-section.

'The first thing I do every morning is get up and walk in and make sure they're still alive,' Amy Suggs said.

'It's just gratifying to know that you're taking care of them, giving them what they need and that they're surviving and making it to another day- very gratifying.'
