Taking paracetamol before a workout can stop you overheating, a study indicates.

Researchers found the drug helps cyclists exercise for longer in hot conditions by reducing the impact of heat exertion.

It was already known that paracetamol swallowed before exercise can lift performance through a reduction in perceived pain.

Work out pills: Paracetemol helped the test subjects perform better

The latest study shows the positive effect in hot conditions. Researchers at the University of Kent said the drug appears to reduce the body’s temperature during exercise, which subsequently improves tolerance to stifling heat.

The study involved 11 young recreational exercisers, all male, who were given three exercise challenges.

They consumed single doses of paracetamol, or a placebo, before cycling at a fixed intensity for as long as they could in temperatures of 18C and 30C.

During the exercise, measures of core and skin temperature were recorded, alongside the participants’ perception of the heat.

The results showed the drug allowed them to cycle significantly longer at 30C – by an average of four minutes.

Men had a significantly lower core, skin and body temperature and found the exercise produced less heat strain.

Tested: The study was carried out on 11 cyclists, who were given three challenges to complete

Dr
Lex Mauger, who led the study at The University of Kent’s School of 
Sport and Exercise Sciences, said the study raised questions that needed
to be settled by sports bodies, including ‘rescue remedies’ for people 
undertaking exercise in hot climates.

He said ‘Firstly, consideration
by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and local anti-doping 
authorities should be made about the use of non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in sport - on both health and 
performance grounds.

‘Secondly, the utility of paracetamol as a 
first-response drug to exertional heat illness should be investigated.’ 
The same research team have previously shown that paracetamol can 
improve endurance performance through a reduction in exercise-induced 
pain.

Dr Mauger said ‘Whilst we have found that paracetamol improves 
the time someone can exercise in the heat, and that this occurs 
alongside a reduced body temperature, we did not measure the specific 
mechanisms by which this may have occurred.

‘It is important now to 
try and isolate how paracetamol reduced participants’ body temperature 
during exercise.’ In a 2008 study, researchers at the University of 
Bedfordshire gave paracetamol to 10 cyclists before they completed a 
simulated 10-mile time trial.

On average, they completed this time 
trial 30 seconds faster after taking the drug than when they performed 
the same test after taking a placebo.

The cyclists’ ratings of 
perceived exertion were the same on both occasions, which led to the 
conclusion that paracetamol was improving performance capacity by 
reducing pain.

The study is reported in the journal Experimental Physiology.
