Accused: Carol Velasquez, 49, pictured, was arrested on Tuesday on the charges, which relate to the labor and delivery of children in Indiana during 2009 and 2010

A South Carolina midwife linked to the death of an Indiana newborn in 2010 has been indicted on 17 felony charges of unlawfully practicing medicine and obtaining and procuring legend drugs.

Carol Velasquez, 49, of Aiken, was arrested on Tuesday on the charges, which relate to the labor and delivery of children in Indiana during 2009 and 2010. She was indicted by a Marion County grand jury.

The midwife was named in a March 2011 Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department report involving the death of a baby boy. the child's mother is one of four victims identified in the grand jury indictment handed down on March 28.

It is unclear what role Velasquez played in the baby's death and the report says the case is still ongoing.

The child's parents, who MailOnline has chosen not to identify, were clearly distraught after the death of their newborn on December 20, 2010.

The father posted a photograph of their deceased son on Facebook on Christmas day 2010, with the caption: '(My wife) is home today. She is starting the healing process now. We are grateful for friends and family. We are grateful He has us in His hands. We have some pics of out boy, here is one.'

The little boy looks peaceful, wrapped in a white and blue hand-knitted blanket alongside a statuette of a couple embracing and a stone engraved with the word 'Love.'

Friends and family posted comments under the tragic photograph, comforting the mourning couple, who are in their 40s and appear to be foster parents to older children, telling them they're in their prayers.

Yesterday's indictments allege Velasquez
administered the drugs cytotec, which can induce labor; T4 and T3, 
thyroid medications; and pitocin, which can strengthen labor 
contractions and control bleeding, to women she was assisting in 2009 
and 2010.

Deputy Prosecutor Kristina Korobov said: 'The primary concern there is the prescription of drugs, essentially turning a home birth into a hospital birth except you are doing it in a home and without the proper training for it.

'These are things a doctor would do, specifically administering drugs internally to a patient. And that's extremely concerning when you see stuff like that happening.'

According to the indystar.com, Velasquez is listed on the South Carolina Department of Heath as a licensed midwife, with her license extending from October 14, 2011 until October 31 this year.

In South Carolina, a midwife is not 
required to be a nurse however Indiana's more strict rules do require 
this and if the certified nurse midwife wants to prescribe medicine, 
they must work in collaboration with a doctor.

Velasquez turned herself in and was released on $15,000 bond. At her court appearance on Tuesday, the woman looked emotional as she entered a preliminary not-guilty plea. Supporters of the midwife waved placards outside the City-County Building claiming the charges were unfair.

'I think they are completely false and not true. I've worked with Carol. I know her to be an upstanding citizen,' Angie Herzberger, Velasquez's friend, told theindychannel.com. 'I have never seen her use any illegal drugs. She uses only natural methods.'

Sarah Reeves, another friend of Velasquez, said: 'They really should be going after dangerous people, not people like Carol. She's done nothing but help people.'

Velasquez, who has been living in Aiken for the past two years, did not talk to reporters, but her husband, Marty Velasquez, insisted she was innocent. 'You can tell by the crowd around she is well-respected and well-loved,' he said.

A pre-trial conference is set for May 28 in Marion Superior Court. A jury trial is scheduled for 8:45 a.m. June 3.
