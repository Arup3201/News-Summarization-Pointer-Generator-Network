A redheaded man who was picked on throughout his schooldays for his bright ginger hair has beaten the bullies by creating a successful modelling career.

Louis Evans, 22, was nicknamed 'Rusty' by his classmates and taunted for his bright red hair and freckled face.

For Louis modelling had never been an obvious career option and his first job was in an office supply company as a cold caller.

Louis Evans beat his high school bullies and has built a successful modelling career

Since the start of his modelling career Louis has appeared on the catwalks of London Fashion Week and in the pages of British Vogue

However, once Louis reached the age of 20 he blossomed into a striking high-cheekboned model and was signed up by a leading modelling agency - Booking Models.

He has since appeared at London Fashion Week, on the pages of British Vogue, and has recently been grabbed by Milan agency - Independent Men - to take part in June's Milan Fashion Week.

Louis, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said that it is his ginger hair, which was the reason he was bullied for years, that has made him so popular in Europe where red headed models are in high demand.

Louis says his acne always got in the way of dating when he was younger, but when he reached the age of 20 it completely vanished

He said: 'In places like Milan, Spain and Greece they adore red heads and put them on a pedestal.

'I like to think it's the fact I'm slim,
 tall and have the face that's got me noticed, but I think having red 
hair does make me different.'

However, having such distinctive hair wasn't always such a gift. Louis says that growing up in Lowestoft prior to his modelling career he was targeted for the way he looks.

'It was quite difficult growing up in a small town. People are very close-minded in Lowestoft.

Louis never imagined a career on the catwalk with his first job being in an office supply company

Louis says that since moving to London his modelling career has gone from strength to strength

'Back at home there were stereotypes about gingers and I had the wrong kind of attention.

'I didn't let it affect me though and I tried not to let it affect my confidence.'

Although Louis tried not to let small minded bullies bother him, he does admit that having acne was a real hindrance in his teenage years.

'I always liked to think I was a bit 
smooth but to be honest I sucked at getting girls. The worst thing is 
that I had acne. I wished every day that it could be gone.'

Louis was always picked on as a young boy with his red hair earning him the nickname Rusty

Louis' good looks blossomed very quickly once he got to 20 and he saw a complete change in a very small amount of time.

'I've got a photo from three years ago and I still have no cheekbones.

'I got to 20 and suddenly I just had them and the acne cleared up and now my face is flawless.

'I started getting a lot of attention, especially when I moved to London.'

Despite his obvious aesthetic turn around Louis still lacked confidence and it was his mother who finally pushed him into his line of work.

'I didn't have the confidence before 
to apply to the modelling agencies. My mum kept saying I could do it and
 I just kept saying "No, I don't know"'.

Louis said it was his mother who encouraged him to follow a career in modelling once he reached the age of 20

Louis'
 mother Jo McCall - a former beauty queen - was keen to see that Louis 
pursued his modelling career. She said: 'I am just very happy that he is having all of these amazing experiences.

'He is really working hard to achieve his goals and I am very proud of that.'

Feeling he was in a dead-end job was instrumental in pushing Louis' determination to succeed.

'Working as a stationary salesman was the most boring job. It was just terrible and I walked out.

'I always had so much drive and ambition and energy but I never knew what to do with it.

'Nothing I did seemed to be the right thing and then I moved to London and it all clicked in to place.'

He
 has also taken part in the Red Hot campaign which celebrates models 
with red hair and appeared on the BBC'S The One Show as part of the 
drive to break the negative stereotype.

Louis' new lifestyle sees him attending exclusive nightclubs and parties, and he has even spent time with the Saudi Royal family.
