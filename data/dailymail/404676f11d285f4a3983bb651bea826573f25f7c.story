Two people were struck by lightning as severe thunderstorms swept through Sydney causing flight chaos and traffic delays.

Luckily only minor cases, a man in his 20s was hit by lightning in Hazelbrook, in the Blue Mountains while another person was struck in Cabramatta in Sydney's southwest, said an ambulance spokeswoman.

The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe thunderstorm warning on Wednesday afternoon for areas near Parramatta, Sydney Olympic Park and Richmond.

The bureau warned the storm was moving towards the north east and was forecast to hit Hornsby, Sydney city, the Harbour Bridge and the northern beaches.

The New South Wales capital was plunged into darkness by 5.30pm but by 7pm the worse of the storm seemed to have passed although at least 13,000 homes in the Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury, Southern Highlands and Western Sydney regions were still without power.

The commute home for many Sydneysiders was thrown into disarray with ferries stranded as they were unable to dock and traffic was brought to a standstill on the Harbour Bridge.

One driver described the scene on the bridge as a 'car park'. 

Lightning also wreaked havoc in Pyrmont - in Sydney's inner-city - with an electrical substation catching alight after it was hit.

Large amounts of dark smoke was seen billowing out of the building just after 6.30pm, but it has since been extinguished.

It took 20 firefighters around two hours to put out the fire and while authorities aren't sure what caused it, they think it may have been due to lightning.

The fire proved tricky for firefighters who were prevented from using water to extinguish the substation blaze as it had about 11,000 volts of electricity running through it, Superintendent Ian Krimmer said.
