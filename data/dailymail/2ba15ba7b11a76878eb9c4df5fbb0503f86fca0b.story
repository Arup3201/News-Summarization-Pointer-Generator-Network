Rain is the likely culprit in a pair of California tour bus accidents only miles apart that have left one dead and dozens injured.

The buses overturned in both accidents, which occurred about 30 miles and about 10 minutes apart on Interstate 15 north of San Diego- one in Fallbrook claimed the life of one passenger and left 22 injured, the one in Corona left 30 injured.

The Fallbrook crash involved seven or eight vehicles and killed one person while 22 others were taken to local hospitals â€“ the deceased is a woman who was ejected from and pinned underneath the wreckage, according to NBC Los Angeles.

Those injured in Corona were mostly minor, with one in critical condition at a local hospital, according to the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin.

Deadly: The Fallbrook crash killed one and injured 22 - many of whom were ejected from the bus

Blame it on the rain: The Corona accident happened after the bus hydroplaned on the rain-slicked highway, according to the driver

The Fallbrook bus, operated by Five Star Bus Charter, was traveling southbound on I-15 at 55mph at about 2.30pm when it began swerving, the driver told investigators, according to ABC 10.

Multiple other people were ejected from the bus, according to KABC, but only one person died, the others somehow suffered only minor injuries.

The deceased has not yet been publicly identified.

The highway was slick after it had been raining in torrents a short time earlier, which the driver blamed for the deadly accident, the station said.

The overturned bus caused massive delays as multiple lanes of the highway had to be closed during the rescue operation.

Authorities are still investigating the accident, but havenâ€™t ruled out rain as the cause. 

The bus had been traveling from Los Angeles to Valley View Casino, in San Diego, according to ABC 10.

The deadly accident happened only 30 miles from a separate accident in Corona.

The Corona accident, which occurred at 2.43pm, left 30 injured, mostly minor, according to the Los Angeles Daily News.

A California Highway Patrol Officer told the paper that it was raining hard at the time of the accident, but it is not yet clear if that is the main cause.

Kicked out: Survivors in the Corona bus accident crawled out through escape hatches in the roof and were carried out through the removed windshield by rescuers

Wheeled away: Another victim of the Fallbrook crash is loaded into an ambulance to be taken to a local hospital

A massive undertaking: Several dozen emergency workers tended to the injured and investigated the cause of the deadly Fallbrook accident

As far as the eye can see: Traffic was snarled for miles as lanes were closed and motorists slowed down to look at the deadly Fallbrook accident

All northbound lanes were closed while fire fighters pulled injured people from the overturned bus, others wriggled their way through kicked-out escape hatch on the roof, according to KTLA.

The bus was heading to nearby Garden Grove from the Pala Casino Spa & Resort, also in San Diego, according to KABC.

Both accidents resulted in massive traffic delays going in both directions as passersby slowed down to take a look.

The bus, owned by Sina Coach, was carrying mostly Vietnamese gamblers, a spokesperson told NBC Los Angeles.

Five Star Bus has had two crashes in the past two years, but Sina Coach has zero.

The cause of both accidents remains under investigation, according to reports.
