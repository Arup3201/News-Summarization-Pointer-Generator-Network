Trying to cross a river can be a dangerous task - especially if you happen to be a baby gazelle.

Sadly for this naive animal taking a flying leap across a crocodile-infested part of the Kenyan Mara River was not the best tactic.

Rather than gracefully hopping to the other side this Thomson's gazelle ending up becoming dinner for a pack of hungry crocodile.

Ensnared: This unlucky Antelope was caught mid-air by a crocodile whilst trying to leap across the Kenyan Mara River

Thwarted: Trying to cross a river can be a dangerous task - especially if you happen to be a baby Thomson's gazelle

Beginning of the end: The Antelope's legs splay out in shock as the crocodile grabs holds of its body

French wildlife photographers Michel and Christine Denis-Huot were watching antelopes crossing the river when they witnessed the dramatic moment.

'Several big crocodiles were waiting in the water for small prey in a place the antelopes regularly cross,' said 59-year-old Christine.

'When the gazelle began to cross, one baby didn't realise that the immobile things looking like trunks in the water were in fact dangerous crocodiles.

She went forward, saw the movement of the first crocodiles she met and jumped above them.

'She ended up directly in the jaws of another one.'

Michel and Denis regularly travel to Africa to document the natural world they encounter.

Some
people the couple of shown these pictures to have been shocked at 
seeing a cute-looking baby antelope being eaten by crocodiles.

'It's
not the first time we have taken pictures of crocodiles catching a 
beautiful creature like this gazelle,' said Michel, aged 60.

'Some people don't appreciate these types of images.

'But many of them understand its nature.'

Bad luck: The antelope landed directly in the jaws of the waiting predators

Final seconds: The crocodiles encircle the animal before its last moments
