A reporter covering a story about a missing boy has found the youngster in a neighbor's yard.

Cameron Polom, who works for WFTS in Tampa, Florida, discovered 10-year-old Paul Ezekiel Fagan on Friday after going to his neighborhood to cover a press conference about his disappearance.

Paul, who has a mild learning disability, was last seen playing in the front yard of his grandmother's home at 4pm Thursday. He later told cops he ran away because he needed space from his brother.

His disappearance sparked a massive search by helicopter and sheriff's dogs.

Safe: Ten-year-old Paul Ezekiel Fagan, left, was found covered in dirt in his neighbor's yard by WFTS reporter Cameron Polom, right, in Tampa, Florida the day after he went missing last week

Polom, 29, was walking through the neighborhood with his cameraman after the press conference when he saw a mud-covered child matching Paul's description behind a neighbor's fence.

'I thought to myself, "oh this couldn't be the boy, no way",' Polom told ABC News.

'I walked over and said, "Hey bud what's your name?" He mumbled "Paul" and then I asked if I could pick him up over the fence and he gave me a huge hug before we walked over to the officers parked in front of his house.' 

Polom said Paul, who looked worried that he might be in trouble, told him he had spent the night in the neighbor's backyard and had eluded police because of overgrown vegetation.  

Found: His news crew captured the moment Polom took the boy to sheriff's deputies on Friday

Heading home: An officer then took him to his grandmother (in white), who has custody of the boy

Loved: WFTS also caught the moment he was reunited with his father after he was found safe on Friday

'He told me he simply needed space from his little brother,' Polom said. 

The news team captured the moment that Polom took Paul to an officer and then reunited him with his grandmother, Hazel Epps, who has custody of the boy.

'Oh, baby. Oh, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus!' she cried as he ran towards her.

Hours later, the news crew also captured the moment he was reunited with his father. He ran towards his dad and jumped into his arms for a massive hug.

'It's like a wonderful joy - like your son first being born,' his father said. 'I love him.' 

Debbie Carter, a public information officer for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, said the boy was 'just fine' and back in his grandmother's care.

Concerns: Paul, pictured left and right when he was greeted by his father, told Polom that he needed space from his younger brother and ran away from his grandmother's house as they played in the yard

Speaking to Today, Polom said Paul might have approached him because he does not have a threatening appearance. Paul had referred to Polom as 'the skinny guy in a suit' to his relatives.

'I'm not a guy who's walking around with a gun on my hip. I don't have a badge on my chest,' Polom said. 'Maybe he just wasn't afraid to come up to me.'

Polom said he was just happy he could help and shouldn't take the credit for the happy outcome.

'I was just in the right place at the right time,' he said. 'I wasn't out there all night looking for him like the deputies were. Those guys did all the work. I just happened to be there at the right time.'
