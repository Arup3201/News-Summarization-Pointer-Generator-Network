These are the dramatic first images from inside the kosher deli in Paris where fanatical gunman Amedy Coulibaly murdered four shoppers before being killed by armed police.

CCTV footage taken from cameras inside the Hyper Cacher store shows bodies on the floor while a child's pushchair sits empty in one of the isles which is littered with abandoned shopping.

In another chilling image Coulibaly can be seen in the back of the shop wearing a bullet proof vest while a shop assistant stands against the opposite wall with his hands up.

A time-stamp at the bottom of the image shows the time as 1.40pm, almost exactly four hours before firearms officers cut Coulibaly down in a hail of 40 bullets at 5.21pm local time.

Captive: In total 19 people were trapped inside the market after Coulibaly attacked with two Kalashnikov rifles, with this group stuck inside the shop while others hid in the basement freezers

One of the bodies, pictured next to a checkout, is believed to be that of Yohan Cohen, the 22-year-old shop worker who grabbed one of Coulibaly's rifles after the terrorist placed it down.

According to witness accounts Mr Cohen picked up the gun and attempted to turn it on Coulibaly only to find it had jammed. The terrorist then shot him in cold blood and he died on the spot.

Cohen was killed alongside Yoav Hattab, Francois-Michel Saada and Phillipe Braham.

Their bodies have since been flown back to Israel where hey were laid to rest in a private ceremony  in Jerusalem yesterday after an emotional funeral attended by thousands of mourners.

In other images some of the hostages can be seen standing on stools or reaching up towards cameras on the ceiling after being instructed to destroy the devices by Coulibaly.

In total 19 people were trapped inside the east Paris store for several hours on Friday last week as armed police surrounded it.

Three people were shot instantly, while two groups fled to the basement where they hid in cold storage units in temperatures as low as -3C.

One man, known only as Ilan, was pictured wrapping his young son in a coat as they cowered in the basement, fearing for their lives.

Meanwhile, upstairs, Coulibaly was explaining to the remaining hostages that he had come from Islamic State and had coordianted his attack with Said and Cheif Kouachi.

The brothers had attacked the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo two days previously, and were at that moment also surrounded by armed police in a print works outside the city.

After murdering Mr Cohen, Coulibaly ordered some of the other hostages to come up from the freezers, which they did, before ordering one man, named as Mickael B, to call a TV station.

Coulibaly  BFM TV, justifying his actions and admitting he had killed a policewoman shot while on duty during a traffic stop on Thursday.

Secretly, Mickael then also called police. ‘A policeman told me that we should be ready to throw ourselves flat on the ground when the assault came, which would be soon,’ he said.

‘It was obvious that the terrorist was preparing to die. He said it was his reward. He had a weapon in each hand and boxes of cartridges nearby. He suddenly began to pray.’

It was at this point that the siege came to a dramatic conclusion as the gunman charged at officers as they prepared to detonate explosives at the front of the store.

A group of hostages, under instructions from Coulibaly, work together to disable one of the security cameras

The group had to shift several storage bags and use a ladder in order to reach the camera

The man is recorded by the camera as he hands a piece of equipment down to another person held captive alongside him in the kosher deli

Taking charge: Roughly an hour after Coulibaly stormed into the supermarket staff were ordered to destroy the CCTV cameras. The footage survived as it was being stored remotely

The job finished, one of the hostages leaves the room, as the man disabling the camera looks behind him

Destroyed: One of the hostages climbs on to a stool to destroy a security camera on the orders of Coulibaly, who was holding 19 people hostage inside at the time

The inside of the deli (pictured) was left in a mess after Coulibaly stormed the store, killing four people

Coulibaly was then cut down in a hail of 40 bullets fired by officers who had been on duty for more than 50 hours by that point.  

The hostages were then freed and were pictured running from the shop, the look of horror clear to see on the face of one man as he sprinted from the scene clutching his young son.

Just minutes before officers had also stormed into the print works where the Kouachis were making their last stand, ending one of the bloodiest weeks in recent memory in France.

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks solidarity marches were organised in major cities around the country and the globe, with thousands waving banners reading Je suis Charlie - I am Charlie - in sympathy with the journalists that died.

Amedy Coulibaly, pictured here in a 'suicide video' taken before the attack, was killed by 40 police bullets as he charged at armed officers as they prepared to set off explosives by the entrance

On Sunday almost two million people and 50 leaders from around the world took to the streets again in a show of both grief and defiance.

And today the remaining staff of Charlie Hebdo published their first magazine exactly a week after their offices were attacked.

It has a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front page shedding a single tear while holding a sign reading Je Suis Charlie. Above his head is the phrase: All is forgiven.

While the magazine typically sells 30,000 copies its print run was extended to three million, and has since been increased to five million after copies sold out within minutes this morning.

Safe: Armed police officers, some of whom had been on duty for 50 hours, take some of the 19 hostages away from the Hyper Cacher market

Lead away: Some of the hostages rescued from the supermarket move to safety after Coulibaly charged police outside, leading to a shoot-out in which he was killed

Chilling: Since being released the hostages have spoken of how Coulibaly behaved in a cool and collected manner, calmly issuing orders even as he was surrounded by police
