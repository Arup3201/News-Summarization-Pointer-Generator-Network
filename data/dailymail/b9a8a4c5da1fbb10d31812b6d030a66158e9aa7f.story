As a former England captain and big England fan there is nothing I would love more than to see Roy Hodgson’s team reach a quarter-final showdown with World Cup hosts Brazil.

What a tantalising prospect, facing Brazil on their own turf, in the spiritual home of the beautiful game, in a last-eight match that could feasibly happen on July 4 in Fortaleza.

But if I was a betting man I would not risk money on England getting out of Group D, let alone making it within sight of the semi-finals.

Samba showdown: England could face Brazil in the World Cup quarter-finals... should they get through their group

Uruguay: Luis Suarez

Italy: Andrea Pirlo

Costa Rica: Bryan Ruiz

Don't blame it on Rio! Ferdinand is not sure England will progress because they will be physically wrecked

I’m not damning their chances completely. But let’s have a bit of realism and accept that there are three teams in the section who have a shot at progressing, and three into two doesn’t go.

I expect Italy to win the group. They have vast experience in their ranks. They’ve got players who have won a World Cup, with Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi among them.

They’ve got big-stage temperament and high-class individuals, from Pirlo to Mario Balotelli. They’re well organised, always, and England could definitely have had an easier start than a rumble in the jungle in Manaus with the Azzurri.

A point at least from the opening game is a minimum requirement for England, in my view, or an early exit will beckon. And a point is no gimme.

So England will almost certainly need to get the better of Uruguay. That can happen, of course it can. It wouldn’t surprise me if both sides find the net in that second group game, especially if England have had a positive start. But is it feasible England could get beaten by one or both of Italy and Uruguay? Absolutely.

Challenge: Wayne Rooney is still finding his fitness after three warm up games, including against Honduras

Azzurri: With players like Andrea Pirlo (2L) and Daniele Rossi (C) Italy will be favourites to win the group

Double whammy! England could also get beaten by Uruguay, especially if  Edinson Cavani is in form

I hope that does not happen but there are gruelling fixtures ahead, mentally and physically, and we can be our own worst enemy as a country in terms of how we prepare for these tournaments.

The Premier League is brilliant; excitement every week, fantastically popular. But it lets us down as a national team because there is no winter break. We turn up for World Cups already disadvantaged because so many players are injured, bandaged up, drained. And that’s before a ball is kicked.

I’m talking now as somebody who has seen this and lived it. We all play with knocks at times. We all play fatigued on occasions. No big deal. No problem. It’s part and parcel of our profession.

But from inside experience of having been an England player at two World Cups, in 2002 and 2006, playing five matches at each, we were ending the group stages physically knackered, gone — before the knockout stage even started.

Burn out: England players such as Jack Wilshere often arrive at tournaments exhausted from a gruelling Premier League season

Walking wounded: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain faces a fitness race after picking up an injury against Ecuador

Fitness is a huge factor in performance and undervalued far too often. Heavy legs and weary bodies are a real issue when the turnover of games is so quick.

No doubt some people will say, hang on, what about all the foreign players who play in the Premier League and manage to shine? Yes, some do. Carlos Tevez famously went back and forward to Argentina and did the business. Oscar, to name one Brazilian example, plays a heap of games for club and country.

But exceptional people being capable of exceptional feats does not get away from the fact that, as a group, England’s players have a uniquely long, hard, unbroken domestic  season.

In the same boat: Chelsea's Oscar (L) will also have experienced a tough season for club and country

Rested: Didier Deschamps France (L) and Joachim Low's Germany have the advantage of a winter break

Germany have fewer games because the Bundesliga is only 18 teams, and they have a winter break. Spain and Italy: lower tempo leagues, and winter breaks. France? Winter break and arguably less intensity than England, where the pace and grinding physical demands do stack up.

This is not an excuse. But, as someone who knows, I’m telling you that it is one contributory factor and, at elite level, margins matter. We’re going out there with Band-Aids before we get started.

On a more upbeat note, the youth and vibrancy of Hodgson’s squad excite me. I was a kid myself, age 19, when Glenn Hoddle took me to the 1998 World Cup, even though I didn’t play.

Young gun: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain

Fleet foot: Raheem Sterling

Saints alive: Adam Lallana

You get that call and your dreams are made — an opportunity to go to an event most people will never experience. There’s a buzz around the country, the flags come out, expectations build and you realise the size of what is expected. And if you’ve got the right mentality you thrive on that, desperate to deliver for everyone back home. I know the lads in Rio will be full of nervous anticipation and high hopes.

If England are to deliver, though, the tournament has to start well, and that, for me, will entail stopping Pirlo’s magic. How? I recall one Champions League game against Milan for Manchester United at San Siro in early 2010 when Sir Alex Ferguson put Ji-sung Park on Pirlo. He man-marked him out of the game.

Pirlo would typically make up to 90 of his incisive passes per match. That night he was limited to 32. We joked later that Park did such a superb job that when Pirlo woke up the next morning, Ji-sung was at the foot of his bed!

Italian job: Andrea Pirlo ran rings around England at Euro 2012, including a cheeky penalty

Balotelli is also a huge talent but Pirlo is consistently brilliant and if England stop him — unlike at Euro  2012, when he cut us to pieces from start to finish — then that’s a start. In my ideal XI (see panel), I’d hand Danny Welbeck that task.

Getting something from Italy could be the platform to progress, perhaps a second-round match against Colombia or the Ivory Coast. Then maybe that quarter-final.

That for me would be a dream scenario. Over to Roy now. He’s had the courage to select a raw, young squad. Now I hope he gives them a chance to play — and takes off the shackles. Fortune favours the brave.
