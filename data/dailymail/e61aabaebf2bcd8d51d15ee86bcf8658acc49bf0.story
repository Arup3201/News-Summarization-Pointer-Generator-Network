If you think having a jacuzzi on board a yacht might be a bit over the top, check out some of the vessels being launched at the Southampton Boat Show this weekend.

More than 350 boats will be afloat for perusal in the purpose-built marina in Southampton during the annual festival of boating - with more than a handful priced at over a million pounds.

The most expensive boats at the show so far are thought to be Sunseeker's 28-metre yacht which goes on sale for a cool £4.7 million, and the Sunseeker 86 which is priced at £3.6million.

The Sunseeker 28-metre: 'A seductive combination of style and exclusivity' with a price tag to match

The new breed of super-yachts demonstrates not only the vast scale of the marine industry in the UK - but the vast sums people are prepared to pay to stay ahead of the pack.

One of the most luxurious motor-yachts ever to be showcased at the PSP Southampton Boat Show, the Sunseeker 28-metre yacht is described as a 'seductive combination of style and exclusivity' which is both 'daring and dramatic'.

Also described as 'spacious, elegant and practical, with an interior which is is superbly attractive and benefits from exquisite craftsmanship'.

Wraparound glazing and full height windows give panoramic views through an optional drop-down saloon balcony, while the dining area has ultra-modern surroundings and clever use of space.

And if the luxurious interior and sleek modern exterior isn't enough to tempt buyers: 'On the foredeck, large sunpads and comfortable seating areas are perfect for a little al fresco dining. 

'Alternatively head to the flybridge and enjoy a glass of something cold while cruising along the coastline.'

One of Europe’s largest outdoor boat shows, the event will feature more than 600 exhibitors from 22 countries around the world, including some other eye-wateringly expensive vessels.

Celebrities are expected to be out in force too, including Claudia Winkleman who will be a guest on the Sunseeker stand, and Sir Ben Ainslie, who will be there to support the British Marine Federation Apprentices.

Past years have seen Richard Hammond, Dawn Porter, Bear Grylls, Ben Fogle, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Princess Anne, Dame Ellen Macarthur and a number of other high profile personalities appear at the show.

The Sunseeker 86 Yacht (£3.6m) also makes its world debut in Southampton, offering a main saloon 'full of natural light, hand-finished furnishings and state-of-the-art technology. 

'The outstanding level of design and craftsmanship continues below deck, where both the owner’s stateroom and guest cabins offer privacy and extravagance in equal measure,' says the blurb.

With a top speed of approximately 30 knots, guests can experience an exhilarating open-air ride from the flybridge or relax and enjoy the scenery from seating areas both fore and aft.'

The motor-yachts join an elite group of boats on display at the show including  Nordhaven's N76 Spirit of Ulysses (£2million) the largest Nordhavn model ever to be displayed at a European show. 

Princess Yachts UK will debut its S Class 75ft powerboat the Princess S72 (£1.8m) with its dark wraparound superstructure glass and angled hull windows, while Key Yachting world will show its 32ft racing yacht the J/97 Evolution (£108,000) and Hanse the 575 yacht (cost upwards of £155,500).

Countryfile presenter Matt Baker will be opening the show on Friday by sailing into the harbour, and visitors to the show will get opportunities to get out on the water to try out boats and watersport activities for themselves.

'I am very passionate about the great outdoors and looking for adventure, so I’m very excited to be part of the PSP Southampton Boat Show this year,' the TV personality said. 

'As a sailing novice it’s the perfect opportunity to get some more experience out on the water.'

New attractions such as the Boat Show Eye, the chance to try an exhilarating Suzuki RIB Experience ride, having a go in the Challenge 72, or climbing aboard the historic tall ship Phoenix means the organisers are hoping there is something for everyone, children and adults alike. 

The show runs from September 12-21 with a record number of exhibitors thought to be attending.
