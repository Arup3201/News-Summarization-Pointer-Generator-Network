Her name, Pu'iwa, means surprise in Hawaiian.

And this 15-year-old female chimpanzee managed to do exactly that to zookeepers in Honolulu this week.

Pu'iwa (pronounced pooh-eeva) escaped his enclosure at Honolulu Zoo in Waikiki, moving a barrel into position and using it to scale a wall.

Measuring about 4 feet tall, the determined little creature somehow got over the 15 foot fence.

'She's out!': Pu'iwa, the youngest of the chimpanzees at Honolulu Zoo in Waikiki, managed to escape her enclosure on Tuesday

The escape prompted a code red emergency to be announced, with visitors ushered into one area as a precaution

Zookeepers say Pu'iwa used a barrel to scale the 15 foot wall of the enclosure

A visitor saw the escape and alerted staff.

The zoo issued a code red and visitors were ushered into one area as a precaution.

A worker found Pu'iwa sitting on a high wall and shot her with a tranquilizer dart.

'Chimpanzees are not only incredibly athletic but very, very clever,' zoo director Jim Wilkinson told Hawaii News Now.

'Zoos all over the world are always trying to evolve and create better exhibits that really minimize the risk of escape.'

Wilkinson said that was no serious sense of danger, but that they still took serious precaution.

'Anytime you have an incident with the escape of any animal there is a certain element of risk,' he said.

Director of Honolulu Zoo, Jim Wilkinson, tells media how the zoo handled the escape

The zoo, which sits across from Waikiki beach, issued a code red emergency after a visitor noticed the chimp get out of her enclosure

Pu'iwa was out of her enclosure for about one hour

Public safety is our number one priority here so we want to make absolutely sure that this isn't going to happen again.

Pu'iwa has since recovered from the sedation.

She is the youngest of the chimpanzees at the zoo was born at the enclosure.

In 1997, two years before Pu'iwa was born, chimps escaped from the same exhibit by climbing overhanging trees.
