The Obama family was in high holiday spirits at a Washington charity event Sunday as some little Christmas elves entertained them with their mischievous antics.

During a photo op at the Christmas in Washington concert, the president and his family were in stitches as some young patients from the Children's National Medical Center made hilarious faces at the camera.

It was a high point among many at the star-studded annual event, which was hosted this year by Hugh Jackman and featured performances by Sheryl Crow, Janelle Monae and the Backstreet Boys among others.

Say cheese! The president and first lady couldn't help but laugh as these children dressed as elves were up to no good during a photo op at the annual Christmas in Washington benefit concert

Heart-warming: The young elves were patients at the Children's National Medical Center, and received donated gifts prior to the event

Hysterical: The family was still laughing off the little rascals' antics as the real posing for pictures began. But the kids still weren't done making their faces

The Obamas met five of the hospital's young patients, who stole the spotlight dressed as elves.

‘Hey, you guys, you going to help us?’ Mrs. Obama asked.

‘Good job, elves,’ the president laughed. ‘Nice job.’

The whole Obama gang was laughing even more as they said ‘Cheese!’ and two of the little elves showed off their silliest faces.

Unscripted moment: First lady Michelle Obama seemed especially entertained by the elves' antics

Charity event: Before the concert began, the Obamas helped collect presents for patients at Children's National Medical Center in Washington

Before the concert began, Obama, his 
wife, Michelle, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, helped collect presents 
for patients at Children's National Medical Center in Washington. Mrs. 
Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, watched from nearby.

Another
hilarious moment came when Obama could not resist connecting host 
Jackman to the Wolverine character he has played in the X-Men movies.

'I
want to thank our host Hugh Jackman for keeping our safety in mind by 
leaving Wolverine's claws at home,' the president joked.

'It can't be easy to wrap presents with those things': Hugh Jackman hosted the annual event -- and the president even got in a few jabs about the actor's day job playing sharp-fisted X-Men character Wolverine

'It can't be easy to wrap presents with those things; good for carving up roast beast though,' Obama continued.

After an urging from Obama for Americans to remember Jesus Christ's lessons of charity and compassion, Jackman also urged the audience to remember those less fortunate.

'It is the season of compassion. Let us not forget those who are down and out, who are suffering and who have little hope: the Washington Redskins fans,' Jackman said. 'I can say it, I'm a Giants fan.'

The Redskins lost to the Atlanta Falcons earlier Sunday and fell to 3-11 for the season. The New York Giants also lost, though, getting shut out by the Seattle Seahawks as their record fell to 5-9.

Other performers at the concert included actress Anna Kendrick and Pat Monahan, the singer from the band Train.

Retired NBA star Charles Barkley also was on hand to talk about programs at Children's National.

The show will air Friday, December 20 on TNT.
