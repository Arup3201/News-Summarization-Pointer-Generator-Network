Paul Pogba has been urged by Nicolas Anelka to pick Chelsea or Real Madrid if he leaves Juventus this summer.

The 21-year-old midfielder signed a new £70,000-a-week contract with the Serie A giants in October lasting until June 2019.

But reports have recently surfaced claiming that Pogba is unlikely to see the deal through.

And former Chelsea and Real Madrid striker Anelka, who played alongside Pogba during his five-month loan spell at Juventus in 2013, believes that his French compatriot should move to Stamford Bridge or the Santiago Bernabeu, rather than return to Manchester United where he spent three years.

Anelka told France Football: 'My preference is Chelsea, who have really big players and [Roman] Abramovich's financial power, or Real Madrid, who are one of the biggest clubs in the world - if not the biggest.

'And I can see him doing well there, with regards to his playing style and the coach there. Carlo Ancelotti would get a lot out of him.

'In his head, Paul will already know clubs that he wants to play for.'
