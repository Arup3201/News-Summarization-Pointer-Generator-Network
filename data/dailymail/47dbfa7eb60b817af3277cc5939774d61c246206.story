Researchers are rushing to develop a pin-prick test for Ebola that could cut life-saving days off the amount of time it takes to confirm cases of the deadly virus.

Scientists say developing a test for Ebola that gives an instant result could be vital is stopping the march of the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people in west Africa so far and is spreading.

Scientists at Tulane University in Louisiana are working in conjunction with the Viral Haemorragic Fever Consortium in Sierra Leone on a simple pin-prick test to provide an instant Ebola diagnosis.

Nurses at Ebola treatment centres like this one in Monrovia, Liberia, could use a rapid diagnostic test that identifies the killer disease in minutes rather than days 

Airports around the world are introducing thermometer tests to determine whether passengers have symptoms of Ebola, such as fever

But the temperature tests do not determine whether a passenger is carrying the deadly disease 

Dr Robert Garry, professor of microbiology at Tulane, said early diagnosis of the disease is vital when it comes to preventing its spread.

Under current protocols it can take three days for a blood sample to be tested in a lab which can increase the risk of a patient transmitting Ebola to other people. 

In addition to reducing the wait time for results, the system under development uses a simple pin-prick device that dramatically reduces the chance of healthcare workers suffering needle-stick injuries associated with traditional long syringes.

'Everyone has their shoulder to the wheel to get this done,' Dr Garry told Nola.com.

He said his team has been working around the clock to increase the accuracy of the test which is designed to identify the specific proteins associated with the disease. 

The research is being backed by $2.9 million grant.

The new system is undergoing a series of tests to determine its accuracy. Once his team is convinced the test works, Dr Garry said it was hoped the US Food and Drug Administration will fast-track authorisation so the test can be deployed at airports and in the field.

Researchers hope the FDA will fast-track their diagnosis test so it can be deployed as quickly as possible 

Dr Garry said he has lost six of his colleagues battling the disease and wants the new test ready as quickly as possible. 

He said Ebola's arrival in the United States will create a greater urgency for action.

Dr Garry said: 'I think it's pretty clear to people here that we can't allow that situation to spiral and spiral and spiral out of control. We're one people — we can't say it's happening in one part of the planet and not here.'

The World Health Organisation says 4,033 confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola deaths have now been recorded.
