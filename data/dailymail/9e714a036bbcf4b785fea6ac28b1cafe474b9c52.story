Jan Filochowski, who was given the payment on top of his £245,000 salary while in charge of West Hertfordshire NHS Trust

An NHS boss was handed a £45,000 bonus – despite presiding over a scandal in which 800 suspected cancer patients were wrongly discharged from his hospital.

Jan Filochowski was given the payment on top of his £245,000 salary in the same year two people died and hundreds had their lives put at risk by the mistake.

He is one of a number of senior executives who have enjoyed extraordinary pay rewards at a time when the health service is facing unprecedented financial strain.

A damning report shows NHS directors received pay rises at four times the rate of frontline staff in the past two years.

Several earn over £200,000 a year – much more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary.

Yesterday, critics questioned why Mr Filochowski was entitled to the bonus and called for him to take responsibility for the blunders.

He was in charge of West Hertfordshire NHS trust when 810 patients suspected of having cancer were wrongly discharged between 2010 and 2013 due to administrative errors.

At least two died as a result after failing to turn up for appointments, which delayed their diagnosis.

A review by the trust – which runs hospitals in Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead – admitted patients had been let down by administrative failures spanning three years.

Mr Filochowski left to become chief executive of London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital in February last year but resigned in December, two months before the scandal came to light.

The married father of two, 62, now runs a consultancy firm called Healthcare Alliance which advises NHS trusts on how to improve their performance and leadership.

Richard Harrington, Tory MP for Watford, said: ‘He should be held to account and he should take responsibility. The public needs to know on what grounds this bonus was awarded. It was a failure of management and the person at the top needs to take responsibility. One death is one too many.’

Eleven NHS directors have been given pay rises of 15 per cent or more in the last year, said the report by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).

Meanwhile, the health service faces one of its toughest periods of financial austerity due to the cost of caring for an ageing population. Over the last four years it has frozen salaries of many of its staff.

Figures obtained by the RCN from hospitals under the Freedom of Information Act show nurses and midwives’ pay rose by 1.6 per cent over the last year, well below inflation. But executives’ average wage packets have grown by 6.1 per cent in the last two years.

The RCN found West Hertfordshire, presided over by Mr Filochowski, had one of the worst bonus cultures of all NHS trusts. Its former medical director, Dr Colin Johnston, was awarded up to £30,000 on top of his £130,000 salary. He also left last year to work for a private healthcare firm.

Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the RCN, said: ‘The Government has maintained an iron grip on the pay and benefits of frontline staff while the senior managers’ pay bill has seemingly gone unchecked.

‘This is the worst kind of double standard and makes a mockery of their insistence that fairness has been at the heart of their decision making on public sector pay.’

Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It is ridiculous that NHS managers are being given these extortionate pay rises when frontline medical staff have had their pay frozen.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We have an available budget of nearly £1billion for pay increases.

‘We have offered to look at any proposal the unions make on how to use this money. However they have not put forward any proposals to help the lowest paid.’

West Hertfordshire NHS trust confirmed Mr Filochowski’s salary and bonus, although it is not known on what grounds it was awarded.
