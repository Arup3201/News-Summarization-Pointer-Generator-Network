Harry Kane will this week be named in the England senior squad by Roy Hodgson with Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason also poised for a call — but Charlie Austin may have to wait his turn given the amount of attacking talent at the England boss’s disposal.

Kane is leading the charge of new young strikers and the Spurs player has been assured of a promotion from the Under-21s this week.

However, that does not mean England don’t want him to play in the European Under-21 Championships in June, which they have a strong chance of winning.

Kane will come into the senior squad for this month’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and the friendly against Italy so Hodgson can view him at close hand. 

But he will be available for Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate in the summer, rather than the senior squad, who have a friendly against Republic of Ireland and a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia in June.

Tottenham team-mate Mason may also be considered for his first call-up with Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain unavailable. Michael Carrick is back but has had limited game time at Manchester United.

Hodgson is expected to be at Old Trafford for United’s clash with Tottenham on Sunday. 

Austin is likely to miss the cut, even though Hodgson is impressed by the striker’s rise at QPR.

The England manager, who will be at Old Trafford to watch United take on Spurs, has a surplus of talent to choose from up front, with Daniel Sturridge back from injury and Raheem Sterling playing centrally for Liverpool at times.

Wayne Rooney will captain the team and Danny Welbeck is also available. Rickie Lambert is likely to miss out, while Berahino and Ings are set to be in the U21 squad.
