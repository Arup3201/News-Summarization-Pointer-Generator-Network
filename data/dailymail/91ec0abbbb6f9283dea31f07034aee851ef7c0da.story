Hundreds of lung cancer patients in England and Wales are to be denied a life-prolonging drug that will remain available in Scotland.

For the last five years Tarceva has been an option for around 1,000 lung cancer sufferers a year after chemotherapy has failed.

But the NHS rationing watchdog has decided to change its guidance, which experts say will send cancer care ‘backwards’.

Tarceva, a life-prolonging drug used to treat lung cancer patients, is no longer to be available to patients in England and Wales as Nice has changed its guidance on the medication

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has re-reviewed its existing guidance after the chemotherapy drug against which Tarceva was compared went off-patent, leading to a lower price. 

It is the second time in a week that Nice has hit the headlines for proposals that would impose new curbs on cancer treatment.

The prostate cancer drug enzalutamide will be limited to men who have not already tried a different medicine – potentially denying it to thousands of sufferers.

Lung cancer specialists are shocked by the latest draft guidance, saying Nice will leave patients with access to only the chemotherapy, docetaxel, which many patients are too sick to tolerate.

This will effectively leave these less fit patients with no active treatment option to fight their cancer and goes against NHS England’s policy which states that no patient will be without access to cancer treatment.

Tarceva, also known as erlotinib, costs around £1,600 for 30-days of treatment and is taken as a pill at home.

Dr Mick Peake, Consultant Physician at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and Clinical Lead, National Cancer Intelligence Network, (NCIN), said he was unaware of any similar situation in which cancer patients were to lose the chance of using a new drug after several years of approval.

He said it was a backward step that would mean hundreds of patients had to appeal to local areas for permission to use it – even though it remains available nationally in Scotland.

He said: ‘Lung cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat and the decision to remove what has become a standard of care will make our job as clinicians more difficult, particularly impacting on some of our sickest patients.

‘Experienced clinicians need more freedom to be able to choose the treatment that they think is right for each patient.

‘Erlotinib is not a cure but a lot of these patients get good quality of life from using it,’ he added.

He said it was a ‘perverse’ proposal as independent assessment showed the total NHS treatment costs of docetaxel to be higher than those of erlotinib.

This difference arises because docetaxel needs to be given intravenously in hospital, whereas erlotinib is an oral treatment taken at home.

The cost of managing treatment side effects is also greater with docetaxel, especially for life-threatening complications which normally require hospitalisation for antibiotic therapy.

Trials show patients get an extra two months of life on average - it increases one-year survival rates by 43 per cent - and the drug costs about £1,700 a month per patient.

Doctors say the decision effectively means cancer care in England and Wales is going 'backwards'

Nice said draft guidance provisionally recommends both erlotinib and another drug called gefitinib for people with non-small-cell lung cancer in specific circumstances.

However, this will rule out some patients who would previously have been eligible for erlotinib.

Sir Andrew Dillon, Chief Executive at NICE said: ‘When we update recommendations, it is driven by changes in the evidence, as we have to be confident that the benefits that drugs offer patients really do justify what the NHS will have to pay for them.

‘The ongoing review of these two treatments incorporates new evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of erlotinib and gefitinib – the revised recommendations aim to ensure that patients are offered the most appropriate treatments.’

The decision was made because the drug is more expensive than an alternative that has just come off-patent
