Tragic: Rugby star and TV pundit Ieuan Evans was left 'stunned' after his sister was found dead at the bottom of a cliff

Rugby star and TV pundit Ieuan Evans was left 'stunned' after his younger sister was found dead at the bottom of a cliff.

The body of Non Evans, 45, was discovered near the beach on the Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales.

The former Wales and British Lion hero, 48, spent today comforting his elderly parents after the tragedy.

He said: 'We are all stunned and absolutely devastated at the tragic loss of Non.

'We thank everybody for their heartfelt concern and hope that we can be allowed time to grieve and come to terms with our loss.â€™

Former athlete Ms Evans, whose married name was Thomas, had two children aged eight and five.

She went missing from her Swansea home before she was found.

It is thought she drove from her house to the Southerndown beauty spot overlooking the Bristol Channel.

Her body was discovered by a walker yesterday evening who raised the alarm.

Rescue teams recovered her body from the foot of the cliffs.

A South Wales Police spokeswoman said: 'Officers are investigating the sudden death of a 45-year-old woman from Swansea.

'Officers attended cliffs in the Southerndown area at around 7.50pm on Wednesday and assisted in recovering the body of the woman.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious. Next of kin have been informed and a file is being prepared for HM Coroner.'

Winger Ieuan played for Wales 72 times, 28 as captain.

He also won seven caps for British Lions.

He scored a record 33 tries for Wales and played for club sides Llanelli and Bath.

Ieuan, now a rugby pundit for Sky TV, was awarded an MBE for services to rugby in 1996, and retired from the game in 1999.
