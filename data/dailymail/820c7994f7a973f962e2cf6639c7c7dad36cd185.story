Goalkeeper Hope Solo has maintained she was the victim of domestic violence following a brawl at a family event - and not the aggressor, as police initially said - in her first interview since the incident last year.

The 33-year-old athlete admitted however that it was 'stupid' of her to get into a U.S. Soccer van last month after a night out with her husband, who was charged with driving under the influence, resulting in Solo being banned from the game for 30 days.

Solo was charged with two counts of domestic violence assault in June last year a family party in Washington state, following an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew, who weighs 280lbs and stands 6ft 9in, however the charges were later dropped.

In a sit-down with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America on Wednesday, Solo said that she was assaulted by her nephew.

'I was the victim': Despite police claiming she was the aggressor, Hope Solo has said her nephew assaulted her at a family function in Washington state last June, in which she was charged with assault

'It was a horrible choice': Solo admitted to Robin Roberts on Wednesday that her actions during a traffic stop in California last month - which lead to a 30-day suspension - were 'stupid'

'I am very grateful U.S. Soccer let due process play itself out': Solo is grateful to have been reinstated 

'It's still very difficult for me to talk about,' Solo said in the GMA interview.

'I'm not going to go into all the details. 

'I was a victim of domestic violence, at the hands of my 17-year-old nephew, who is 6 foot 9 inches and 280 pounds.

'He struck me over the head and I was concussed pretty severely.

'It was a very scary night.'

Solo's nephew and her half-sister were not charged in the fight, and they still maintain Solo was the aggressor.

U.S. Soccer did not suspend her after the incident, however they did following the controversial traffic stop with her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens.

In January the two were driving in southern California -  where Colo was in a training camp - when Stevans was pulled over in a U.S. soccer van and arrested on suspicion of drink driving.

Solo was said to have become 'belligerent' with police during the stop and was almost arrested for disorderly conduct.

U.S. Soccer subsequently suspended her for 30-days, which threw into doubt her chances to play in next month's Alagrve Cup in Portugal.

However Solo was reinstated last week.

'Well, clearly, I wasn't thinking,' Solo said Wednesday of the incident.

'I mean, it was a horrible choice

'I think I just wasn't in a good place, emotionally, to even make good decisions. 

'I mean, it's not an excuse but I just, it was stupid. 

'I should've called a taxi.'

Solo thanked U.S. Soccer for reinstating her and seeing her through the controversy. 

'All of us, in my opinion, have a fundamental right to be considered innocent until proven guilty,' she said.

'I know U.S. Soccer took a lot of heat.

'But I am very grateful that they let due process play itself out. 

'Those eight months were some of the worst months of my entire life.'

U.S. women's national team coach Jill Ellis announced Solo's inclusion on the Algarve Cup 25-player travel roster on Saturday.   

The United States, playing in its 20th Algarve Cup, opens with Norway.  

Solo has posted inspirational messages from fans on social media during her absence, and cheered on the national team in exhibition games in Europe. 

The United States fell 2-0 against France before beating England 1-0 with goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris starting in both games.

Solo's suspension came at a critical time for the U.S. team, which is preparing for the Women's World Cup this summer in Canada.

'The situation warranted a consequence, and we thought it was reasonable,' Ellis said about Solo before the team traveled to Europe. 

'This is important for us to be able to focus the players that we have on these games and then allow Hope some time to sort of reflect on some things.'

The goalkeeper was dismissed in January from training camp in Southern California, where the team was preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June

It was the latest off-field trouble for the 33-year-old Olympian, considered one of the best goalkeepers in the women's game. 

Earlier this year, a judge dismissed two misdemeanor counts of domestic violence against her. 

Jerramy Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California

Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial.

Her last appearance in a match with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia.

In a statement released following her suspension, Solo said: 'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.'

A representative for Solo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

The Algarve roster also includes Christine Rampone (back), Megan Rapinoe (right knee), who were injured during the team's January training camp in Carson, California, and did not play the two matches in Europe. 

Newly married forward Sydney Leroux, who had been nursing a sore ankle, was also included.

The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title, but first since 1991.
