Cristiano Ronaldo has put his World Cup heartache behind him by sunning himself on the Greek island of Mykonos - while girlfriend Irina Shayk takes part in a topless photo shoot.

The Real Madrid forward could not prevent Portugal from being eliminated during the group stages of the World Cup and has instead headed off to Greece to relax before the new season.

Ronaldo won the Champions League with Real last season but was unable to transfer club form on to the national scene as Portugal succumbed to a premature exit.

Russian model Shayk, meanwhile, posed topless for Maxim's latest edition.

And Shayk told the magazine that she and boyfriend Cristiano Ronaldo, 
the 29-year-old Real Madrid and Portugal soccer player, ignore the 
haters.

She
 said: 'I don't care about people’s opinions, and neither does 
Cristiano. Some people like you; some people hate you. You have to be 
strong.'

Contribution: Ronaldo had just one goal and one assist during the Brazil World Cup

Along with appearing topless on Maxim's 
cover, the sultry brunette also posed in just a pair of white bikini 
bottoms inside the magazine.

The
 28-year-old is eager to carve out an acting career for herself although
 she has complained that she only gets offered sexy roles such as 
strippers or bartenders.

Speaking in the July/August issue of Maxim magazine,
 for which she posed topless on the cover, Irina moaned: 'Every time I 
get a script, it’s, like, bartender…stripper… And I don’t think I would 
make a bad bartender or stripper, you know?'

However, she was thrilled to land the 
role of Hercules' love interest Megara in the new movie Hercules which 
sees The Rock play the legendary son of Greek god Zeus.

She said: 'But Greek mythology! Irina is a Greek name, so I think: Maybe it’s destiny?'
