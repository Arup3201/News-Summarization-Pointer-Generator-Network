Sir Alex Ferguson's fears were confirmed when Phil Jones was ruled out of Manchester United's Champions League clash with Real Madrid.

The England defender, 21, had been a major doubt for the second leg since damaging ligaments in his right ankle in the FA Cup victory over Reading two weeks ago.

He missed training on Monday morning and Ferguson confirmed his absence shortly after the session.

'He's not fit. He won't be fit for tomorrow,' said the Scot.

Losing Jones is a major blow for the 
United manager, who used the player in a defensive midfield role to 
blunt Madrid’s considerable attacking threat in a 1-1 draw at the 
Bernabeu.

Ferguson, who was joined by Sir Bobby Charlton at the training session, gave Jones 
every chance to be fit in time, but he had not even started 
light training until the end of last week after the club’s medical staff 
estimated a three-week lay-off.

Meanwhile, Ryan Giggs will play a part
in what will be the 1,000th game of his career.

There also appears to be a slight 
concern over Jonny Evans, who trained away from the rest of the 
first-team squad this morning, doing some light running on an adjoining 
pitch.

But Robin van Persie, Patrice Evra 
and Danny Welbeck, who all picked up knocks in Saturday’s 4-0 win over 
Norwich, trained without any problems.

A huge media presence this morning 
was a reminder of the magnitude of this fixture, with Spanish press and 
television crews turning up in numbers before heading over to Manchester
City’s Etihad Stadium, where Real will train this afternoon.

Two members of the Glazer family, 
Joel and Avi, even watched the players go through their paces from a 
balcony overlooking the pitch.

Tuesday's Champions League clash between Manchester United and Read Madrid is the match of the season so far. Sportsmail will have news and pictures of all the build-up as it happens:

They were greeted by freezing 
conditions as the United squad, many wearing hats and gloves, formed two
circles and played keep-ball with two players in the middle trying to 
win it back.

Captain Nemanja Vidic, unlikely to play if Evans 
is fit, found himself in the middle more than most.

Afterwards fitness coach Mike Strudwick oversaw some quickstep exercises over small hurdles as the intensity increased.

Overall, the mood seemed relaxed and 
even jovial at times with Ferguson – wrapped up against the cold in a 
grey anorak and hat – looking on.

The United boss is set to appear at 
his pre-match press conference alongside Ryan Giggs at Old Trafford on Monday afternoon as the build-up to the big game continues.

United midfielder Michael Carrick acknowledges nights like this are the ones that really get his competitive juices flowing.

After
almost seven years at Old Trafford - during which time he has gained four 
Premier League title-winning medals, won one Champions League and played in two other 
finals - Carrick has enough experience not to be overwhelmed by the 
biggest of occasions.

But he accepts certain matches are beyond the norm.

'These
are the nights you live for,' he said. 'It is extra special. There is 
just something in the air. Everyone comes to the stadium with a spring 
in their step.

'Every supporter is that little bit more vocal. They appreciate how important it is and what it means to get through.

'The prestige and history of the club suggests we should be challenging in the later stages of these tournaments.

'It is up to us to go out there and do it.'

Iker Casillas' presence in the 24-man Real Madrid squad that flew into Manchester on Sunday night underlines the importance being placed on the game by Real boss Mourinho given the vastly experienced goalkeeper has been missing since January, when he fractured his hand against Valencia, and only returned to training on Thursday.
