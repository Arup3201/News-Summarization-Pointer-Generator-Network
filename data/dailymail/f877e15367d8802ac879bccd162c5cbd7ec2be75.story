Police in Tippecanoe County, Indiana have arrested a man who sympathized with the Las Vegas cop killers, after he posted incendiary remarks on Facebook threatening to kill more police and cause more terror. He remained jailed on Sunday.

According to authorities, police reviewed statements made by Samuel Bradbury, 22, of Pine Village, Indiana. These statements, made on Bradbury's Facebook page, reportedly were threats to kill a Tippecanoe County judge, an Indiana Supreme Court justice and two Tippecanoe County law enforcement officers.

In his postings, Bradbury also threatened to 'blow the Tippecanoe County Courthouse to pieces.'

Police say that Samuel Bradbury, 22, threatened police in Indiana in a manner similar to Jerad Miller, who was also originally from the state

According to police, Bradbury claimed affiliation with the same anarchist group that Jerad and Amanda Miller, the shooters in the Las Vegas killing spree, belonged to, the '765 Anarchists.' Both Bradbury and the Millers are from Indiana.

In YouTube ramblings, Jerad Miller called the Tippecanoe County Courthouse 'a beautiful building' but referred to it as 'a monument to authoritarianism.'

According to police, Bradbury was also a member of alarming Facebook groups, such as 'No Tears for Dead Cops' and 'Illuminati Exposed (This is the resistance).'

On June 8, Jerad and Amanda Miller slaughtered two Las Vegas police officers, Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, as they ate lunch that afternoon - shooting both a close range.

They then ran into a nearby Walmart, where Jerad fired a shot into the ceiling and declared 'this is the revolution' and demanded everyone leave.

Joseph Robert Wilcox, 31, a shopper who was carrying a concealed weapon, tried to sneak up on Jerad. However, as he did, he passed by Amanda, not realizing the two were together.Â 

Amanda shot Wilcox at close range, killing him.

Bradbury claims that he was affiliated with the same group as Jerad and Amanda Miller, the '765 Anarchists'

Police footage recently released shows the Millers taking cover in the Walmart where their last stand took place.

The couple then fled to a back corner of the store, where they prepared to make their last stand as officers armed with assault rifles closed in.

The Walmart surveillance video shows both laying on the ground, pointing handguns at each other.

Amanda appears to fire her weapon at her husband, a moment later he goes limp.

The 22-year-old Indiana woman then turns the gun on herself. The video cuts out a moment before she fires the pistol into her own head.

Police originally reported that Amanda had killed her husband, however, autopsy results and further investigation revealed it was police officers who fired the fatal shot. All three officers who shot at Jerad Miller are on paid leave, as per the department policy on firing a weapon on duty.

The Millers frequently dressed as comic book villains from Batman. Jerad especially loved the anarchist Joker

Police also revealed that they had interactions with the Millers on three occasions.

In February, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles called Las Vegas police and asked them to investigate threats Jerad Miller had made against the office. When reached at his apartment, Miller claim he never threatened anyone and said his comment was that 'that's how people get shot.'

'The interaction was normal; there were no anti-government or anti-police statements. They did not feel through the interview that the suspects were a potential threat,' McMahill said at a press conference Thursday.

Police also visited in April and took a witness statement from the Millers in relation to a domestic violence report filed by their neighbors.

Finally, on May 31, the Millers gave a witness statement for a sexual assault that occurred in their apartment complex.

Jerad Miller, in particular, was an avowed neo-Nazi who frequently spouted conspiracy theories about the world. After he and his wife murdered the officers, he draped their bodies with a Gadsden flag, the yellow symbol of the Tea Party, and a swastika.

According to police, Bradbury shared another shared trait with Miller, having been previously arrested for marijuana possession.

Bradbury is currently at the Tippecanoe County Jail. His bond is set at $100,000 cash.
