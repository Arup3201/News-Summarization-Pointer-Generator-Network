Binky Felstead already stars in one of the UK's most popular reality shows, has her very own nail polish collection, blogs for the MailOnline and has even written her biography. But the busy Made In Chelsea star is showing no sign of slowing down.

The ambitious 23-year-old is back with her third collection for the online fashion brand Lipstick Boutique - and this time it's personal.

For her latest range the reality star takes inspiration from her own (huge) wardrobe, combining her signature style with her favourite new patterns and cuts of the season.

Binky's latest collection is based on must-have items from her wardobe

The AW14 capsule collection consists of 17 pieces including trousers, skirts, dresses and kimonos all reminiscent of Binky's laid-back approach to style.

Each piece in the collection is aptly named after London boroughs including the Camden floral print dress and the Battersea halter-neck top. 

Binky's highlights from the collection include  the leather trousers and bohemian kimono, which she says are both uber versatile.

For the 17 piece collection the reality star wanted to embrace the bohemian vibe she loves to channel, here Binky wears the Bow Kimono £55

Prices for the new range start at £40: Left Binky wears the Battersea top £40, Right, Bayswater dress £65

Each of the pieces in the new range is named after a London borough, here Binky wears the Highgate dress, £55

The collection showcases Binky's love for the swinging sixties and the shoot nods to this featuring Beehive hair and eyeliner in feline flicks.

Although the sizes only go up to 14 the designer says that she has taken into account the demands of different shaped fashion fans with the star writing in her MailOnline blog: 'I'm particularly proud of my latest collection – there's an array of pieces to suit different body shapes, styles and occasions, from glam gowns to more comfortable, casual pieces which are perfect for everyday wear.' 

Collection will be available from September 9th at www.lipstickboutique.co.uk. Prices starting at £40.
