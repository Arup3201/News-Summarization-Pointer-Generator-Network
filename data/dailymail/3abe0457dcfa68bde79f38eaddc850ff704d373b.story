Tax: Labour leader Ed Miliband wants to impose a new levy of payday lenders

Payday lenders would face a multi-million pound tax to bankroll credit unions under Labour plans launched today.

Ed Miliband set out plans to levy an additional fee on short-term lenders’ profits because too many people now face a 'personal credit crunch' at the end of every month.

The Labour leader wants to double the £13 million given by the government to extend credit unions, which currently charge no more than 26 per cent a year.

He pointed to the market for payday lenders doubling to £2.2 billion between 2008-09 and 2011-12.

Credit unions, which are not-for-profit lenders, cannot compete with the might of the payday lenders, who critics call ‘legal loan sharks’.

Labour also wants to cap interest rates charged by payday lenders – some of which are over 5000 per cent per year.

The announcement follows David Cameron’s warned yesterday that payday lenders could still face a limit on the rate of interest they charge.

The Prime Minister revealed he had not ruled out capping interest rates but Mr Miliband accused the government of not going far enough.

The Labour leader meet with victims of the industry at a credit union office in Peckham, South London today along with Stella Creasy, the Labour frontbencher who has led the campaign against payday lenders.

Mr Miliband said: ‘The cost of living crisis afflicting millions of Britain’s families is so bad that it is creating a personal debt crisis too.

‘The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid. And, as a result, the market in payday lending has doubled in just four years. Almost a third of the payday loans taken out in Britain at the moment are to cover the cost of people’s gas and electricity bills.

‘For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch.’

Labour controversially proposed energy price caps on energy firms last month.

The policy has been criticised by economists who warned that it will simply force the Big Six to raise their prices before an anticipated cap.

Mr Miliband said that Labour would cap
the cost of credit, halt the spread of payday lenders on the high 
street and force them to fund credit unions.

Miss Creasy praised campaigners who have forced payday lenders put out of football grounds and shopping centres.

She
added: ‘We are determined to see a cap introduced in the UK so that we 
can see an end to this legal loan sharking and give British consumers 
the protection they deserve.’

The
industry has been criticised for preying on vulnerable customers and 
charging annual interest rates as high as 5000 per cent.

From next April, it will come under the control of watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority.

Payday lenders will be banned from repeatedly trying to claw out money from bank accounts to repay debts.

They will also only be allowed to roll-over short-term loans twice, to ensure struggling families are not caught out by spiralling debts.

Payday lenders will already be charged a levy from next April. The money will go towards debt counselling services.

But critics want the government to do more by capping interest rates.

Mr Cameron was pressed again on a cap during Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday and replied: ‘We continue to look at the issue of a cap and I don't think we should rule that out’.

‘We do have to bear in mind what has been found out in other countries and through our own searches about whether a cap would prove effective.’

Earlier this month the FCA was criticised for not including a rate cap in its plans to regulate the industry.

Australia, most parts of the United States and some European countries have capped payday loan interest rates but the FCA has argued that such an approach could push borrowers into the hands of backstreet loan sharks.
