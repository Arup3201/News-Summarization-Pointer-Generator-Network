A teen who survived two deadly plane crashes - one that killed his mother and siblings and another that killed his dad and stepmom - has made his debut for the University of Michigan basketball team.

Three years after he was left fighting for his life in a coma following the second crash, Austin Hatch played for the Wolverines during their first exhibition game in their pre-season tour in Italy.

Hatch, who had to learn how to walk again following the second tragedy in June 2011, didn't score during his three minutes on the court on Sunday, but he reveled in his time playing for the team.

'As you can imagine it has been a heck of a journey to get here,' he told Michigan Athletics after the game.

Excitement: Hatch, pictured in his Michigan uniform, said it was 'unreal' to be playing with the team

'Playing basketball at the University of Michigan has been my goal since I was a little kid. It was unreal to be here and to have actually played a game. I really feel like I have that game under my belt now and I really feel like a Michigan basketball player.'

His astonishing feat comes after a decade of tragedy for the young player.

Austin was just eight when he survived the first plane crash in 2003 when his father flung him out of the burning plane.

But while he and his father survived, his 38-year-old mother Julie, 11-year-old sister Lindsay and five-year-old brother Ian all died in the crash.

Then on June 24, 2011, Hatch's father was flying him, his stepmother and their labradoodle Brady between the family's home in Indiana and a Michigan summer house when they smashed into a garage of the Charlevoix, Michigan airport - and only Austin and Brady made it out alive.

Second tragedy: But then in 2011, his father (pictured) was piloting a plane carrying Hatch, his stepmother and their dog, when the aircraft crashed into a garage - killing the couple and only saving Hatch and his dog

Crash: Just 10 days before the 2011 crash (pictured), Hatch had agreed to play for Michigan after graduation - but he was left with swelling on the brain, a punctured lung abd broken ribs and put in a coma

Pilot error was named as the cause of the crash.

Just 10 days before the crash, Hatch - then the 6ft 6" standout star of Canterbury High School’s team in Indiana - had agreed to play for the University of Michigan upon his graduation.

Instead, he was left in a medically-induced coma with a brain trauma and other injuries, including a punctured lung, fractured ribs and a broken collarbone. 

He needed physical therapy to help him learn how to walk again and it is uncertain whether he will fully regain the coordination that earned him scholarship offers to play basketball.

On losing his family for the second time, Hatch went to live with an uncle in California after deciding to leave his home town of Fort Wayne, Indiana as part of his recovery. 

As he fought to get stronger, Hatch kept his focus on his dream of playing basketball.

'Basketball has always given me something to shoot for,’ he said during an interview last November.

On Sunday, his dream became a reality, as his grandfather Jim cheered him along from the stands.

'It was a special moment,' Michigan coach John Beilein said. 'Austin even led us in the fight song after the game was over. It's something he has worked very hard for.' 

Hatch, who played the final three miutes of the second half of Michigan's 99-60 victory over the Perugia Select Team, said it was 'unreal' leading his team in the fight song after the game.

'I always thought to myself, "I hope someday I am in position to be able to do that",' he said. 'Just like everything else that happened today, it was just unreal to be able to do that.'
