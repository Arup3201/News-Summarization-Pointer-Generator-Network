A teenage father was fatally injected with heroin by a female friend before video and pictures of his lifeless body handcuffed to a bed were posted on Facebook, his mother has claimed.

Dylan Owens, 19, died of an overdose last October at his family's home in Goshen, Ohio while taking drugs with three friends.

Maddison Rogers, 22, of Maineville, was indicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and corrupting another with drugs this week after it is alleged that she injected heroin into the former high school football player's arm. She is being held on $250,000 bond.

However the boy's mother Tina told WLWT today that she believes there were two others who should be brought to justice following her son's death.

Mrs Owen said that her son's friends waited hours to call for help - but before they did, handcuffed Dylan's dead body to a bed frame and posted pictures of him on Facebook which began to circulate.

The mother claims that even Dylan's brother saw the despicable photographs.

She said: 'The one boy videotaped my son and took 
pictures of Dylan and posted it on Facebook. These pictures got out to 
certain individuals that were Dylan's friends. It got out to his 
brother.

'There were three people there, there were 
three people involved and they should all pay for what they did to 
Dylan.'

The Clermont County prosecutor said unless there was new evidence, the other two people who were at the home on the night Dylan died would not be charged.Â 

MailOnline was awaiting a call from the Clermont County Public Defender's Office.

Dylan Owens, who was weeks from signing up for the U.S. Army, leaves a two-year-old son Bentley.

Dylan's mom said this week that she believes two others should be charged over her son's death after they allegedly took pictures of him and posted them on Facebook
