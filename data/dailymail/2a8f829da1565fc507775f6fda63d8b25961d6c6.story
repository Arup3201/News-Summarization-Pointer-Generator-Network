Governor Brewer's book accuses President of ignoring illegal immigration problem in her state

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer dubbed Barack Obama 'thin-skinned' following a spat over her memoirs which paint a less than flattering picture of the President.

Governor Brewer greeted the President yesterday on his arrival in Phoenix and the pair could be seen engaged in an intense conversation at the base of Air Force One's steps.

Both were smiling but speaking at the same time, before Governor Brewer pointed her finger at the President.

'He brought up my book. And he was a little tense,' Governor Brewer later told KFYI radio. 'I asked him if he read my book... he said he read the excerpt and he didn't think that I was very cordial... He was somewhat thin-skinned, a little tense to say the least. I was trying to be very calm.'

Earlier finger pointing incident: Brewer had a famous argument with Obama earlier this year

However Obama brushed off the disagreement with Republican governor Brewer saying the exchange had been 'blown out of proportion'. He added that it was good publicity for a Republican to argue with him.

He told ABC's Diane Sawyer: 'This was really not a big deal. She [Brewer] wanted to give
 me a letter, asking for a meeting. And I said, ''We'd be happy to meet.'''

The President joked: 'I'm usually accused of not being intense enough, right? Too relaxed?'

Brewer
 recently published a book Scorpions For Breakfast, a 
memoir of her years growing up. It defends her signing of Arizona's 
controversial law cracking down on illegal immigrants which Obama 
opposes.

Obama was reportedly objecting to Brewer's 
description of a meeting he and Brewer had at the White House, where she
 described Obama as lecturing her.

In an interview in November, Brewer 
described two tense meetings. The first took place before his 
commencement address at Arizona State University.

'He did blow me off at
 ASU,' she said in the TV interview in November.

She
 also described meeting the president at the White House in 2010 to talk
 about immigration.

'I felt a little bit like I was being lectured to, 
and I was a little kid in a classroom, if you will, and he was this wise
 professor and I was this little kid, and this little kid knows what the
 problem is and I felt minimized to say the least.'

Controversial read: The governor's book paints a less than flattering picture of Obama

On
 the tarmac yesterday, Brewer handed Obama an envelope with a 
handwritten invitation to return to Arizona to meet her for lunch and to
 join her for a visit to the border.

'I said 
to him, you know, I have always respected the office of the president 
and that the book is what the book is. I asked him if he read the book. He said he read the excerpt,' she told reporters.

She said Obama complained that she described him as not treating her 
cordially.

'I said that I was sorry that he felt that way. Anyway, we're glad he's here, and we'll regroup.'

A
 White House official said Brewer handed Obama a letter and said she was
 inviting him to meet with her.

The official said Obama did note 
that after their last meeting, which the official described as a cordial
 discussion in the Oval Office, the governor inaccurately described the 
meeting in her book.

The
 full title of the book is Scorpions for Breakfast: My Fight Against 
Special Interests, Liberal Media, and Cynical Politicos to Secure 
America's Border.

In the 
memoir, Governor Brewer accuses the Obama administration of turning a 
blind eye to the problem her state has with illegal immigrants and an 
unprotected border because migrants will help register more Democratic 
votes.
