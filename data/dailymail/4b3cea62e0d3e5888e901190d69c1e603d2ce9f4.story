It was ridiculed by critics at the Cannes Film Festival and struggled to raise any interest in the UK.

Now, Keith Allen's controversial documentary about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed, will not be shown anywhere else in the world.

Unlawful Killing had been set to premiere in the U.S. on August 31 on the 15th anniversary of her death and was also set to open in cinemas in Spain, India, Russia, Brazil and Italy.

Allen had accused the Royal Family of masterminding the car crash that caused the death of Diana, Princess of Wales as a 'warning' to her to toe the line.

In the documentary Prince Phillip is also branded a 'Fred West-style psychopath' who 'orchestrated the murder', while the Queen was dismissed as a 'gangster in a tiara'.

Allen said the House of Windsor had 'got away with murder' because no one had been held to account over the accident.

It premiered in Cannes last year but critics dismissed it as 'absurd', 'twaddle' and 'unlawfully dull'.

Allen admitted he had struggled to get interest in the UK because of strict libel laws but insisted there was global demand for his project,

But it has now been shelved indefinitely after distributors failed to secure the necessary insurance to bring in to cinemas.

A spokesman for the film said: 
'Unlawful Killing has been sold all around the world. But there was a 
specific form of insurance needed by the U.S. distributors to cover them 
for their French and UK offices.

'This proved impossible to secure. The film has been withdrawn in perpetuity.'

Without the distributors would not be covered for the expense of any libel litigation brought through their French or British offices.

The production was backed by Dodi's father Mohammed Al-Fayed, who invested £2.5 million in bringing it to screen.

The controversial documentary Unlawful Killing, by Keith Allen, right, accuses the Royal Family of masterminding the car-crash  which killed Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed in 1997

In the film, the inquest in to her 
death is presented as a cover-up in which different arms of the British 
establishment - including the police, the Courts, and the Royal Family, 
as well as the French coroner and government - had a hand.

Unlawful
Killing opens with details of a letter penned by Diana to her Butler, 
in which she claims that Prince Charles is planning to have her murdered
in a car accident.

Dodi's father Mohammed Al-Fayed, former owner of Harrods, invested £2.5 million in the project

The production stated the 36-year-old could have been saved had she been taken to hospital quickly - and that the inquest failed to properly investigate why.

The film shows the graphic black and white close-up of Diana taken moments after the Mercedes carrying the couple crashed in a Paris underpass, for a few seconds.

The distressing image, in which her blonde hair and features clearly visible, has never been publicly seen in this UK.

Allen said: 'The photo is not used in the film for the purpose of shock. It is included as evidence, because it shows clearly that, although Diana had been injured in the crash, she was alert and very much alive. I repeat: it is not a picture of a dying woman.

'As medical evidence presented at the inquest confirmed, if Diana had been taken promptly to hospital by Dr Jean-Marc Martino, she could well have survived.

He added: 'Using the picture is not sensational - it illustrates the story.' The film features Al-Fayed accusing the Royal Family of being racist - and in particular Prince Phillip.

Allen, who authors the documentary, suggests in it that the Establishment was unhappy with Diana's relationship with Dodi, because he was a Muslim, and it would have caused problems had the pair married.

It also claims that her role in the anti-landmine campaign put her at risk from those in the arms industry, and those in power who had links to it.

In 2008, after a six-month inquest which heard evidence from 250 witnesses and cost taxpayers an estimated £12million, a jury concluded that Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed were unlawfully killed as a direct result of grossly negligent driving by drunk chauffeur Henri Paul, who also died in the crash.

The actions of photographers following the car were also cited.
