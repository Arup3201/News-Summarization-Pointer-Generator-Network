These are the images all Australia has been waiting to see - young fast bowler Sean Abbott showing that he's ready to resume playing top-class cricket tomorrow at the Sydney Cricket Ground, two weeks after bowling the ball that fatally struck Phillip Hughes on the same field.

Abbott, 22, is in the New South Wales squad to face Queensland in a Sheffield Shield match, on the same day it was confirmed that Australian captain Michael Clarke will take his place in the Test team to meet India in the First Test.

Traumatised by Hughes' death, Abbott chose to sit out last weekend's resumption of Sydney grade cricket but today, after emotional embraces from team-mates, threw himself into a full training session.

Team officials named Abbott in the side but said he would have the final call on whether he plays or not. 

Hughes collapsed after being struck in the neck by an Abbott bouncer in the Shield match between South Australia and NSW at the SCG on November 25. He died two days later.

Abbott, who made his international debut in October, returned to training with NSW last Tuesday and was among the more than 5000 mourners at Hughes's funeral the next day in the northern NSW town of Macksville.

Hughes' death sent shockwaves through the international cricket community, and senior Australian players have conceded that returning to the playing field has been a challenge.

There has been speculation Abbott may be too traumatised by Hughes' death to make a full and effective return to the sport.

 Abbott has been supported by all parts of the cricket community, including Hughes' family and Australian captain Michael Clarke.

Cricket NSW says all players, Abbott included, will be given the opportunity to decide when they want to return to playing. 

The SCG wicket where Hughes was struck has been retired by groundskeepers and will not feature again during Australia's summer of cricket.

Trauma experts say the impact of Hughes's death might not sink in for Abbott for weeks.

But they also say that returning to training and competition, if he's surrounded by supportive team-mates, could help him recover quicker from any psychological damage.

Phillip Hughes died on November 27 after suffering a head injury two days earlier while batting for his adopted state South Australia against his home state New South Wales two days earlier

The pitch on which Phillip Hughes was stricken by a bouncer will no longer be used this summer

Hughes' grieving South Australian team-mates are also yet to decide if they will play Tasmania in the next round of the Sheffield Shield.

'I wouldn't recommend (the players) stay away (from the sport) at all, actually,' said Michael Burge, director of the Australian College of Trauma Treatment.

'They just need to be taking into account that they may be a little bit awkward or not quite on their game as they were for a few weeks.'
