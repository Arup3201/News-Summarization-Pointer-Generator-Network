Napoli and former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, a Sportsmail World Cup columnist, gives his take on the key players as England prepare to take on Italy in their Group D opener in Manaus.

ITALY

GIANLUIGI BUFFON

This may be his fifth World Cup but you can see he still has excellent quality with his hands and feet. He keeps his defence calm and his experience wins Italy games. A great character and good example for everyone  to follow.

Shot stopper: Gianluigi Buffon is a fine example to follow, at the age of 36, he organises the defence well

MARCO VERRATTI

He may be small but don’t be fooled he is strong. A dynamic midfielder with great intelligence, Italians have questioned if he can play in the same team as Pirlo and a slight injury may prompt Prandelli to favour Claudio Marchisio.

Stylish: But Marco Verratti may not get in the same team as charismatic playmaker Andrea Pirlo

ANTONIO CASSANO

Very clever player who can make the difference in tight games. May come on from the bench but understands the game well and gets into positions to cause danger. Has lost weight after cutting back on focaccia but still strong.

Key sub? Antonio Cassano can make an impact off the bench in crucial games

MARIO BALOTELLI

Not had the best season but it’s always the same with him; he has great qualities and if he concentrates on his football he can be excellent.  May be used by Prandelli as a target man to help give Italy’s midfield the control.

Not the best season: But Mario Ballotelli can turn any game on its head

CIRO IMMOBILE

Has just moved to Dortmund for £15m. A confident character and real worker who will chase lost causes and won’t let any defence rest. Scored 22 goals last season and could play as a lone striker or in partnership with Balotelli.

Poacher: Serie A top scorer and new Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile could link up with Balotelli

ENGLAND

GARY CAHILL

We could see his potential at Chelsea. Has a great attitude, is willing to listen and has good feet. Champions League experience will give him confidence and he can be an aerial threat.

Potential fulfilled: Gary Cahill is a fine listener and has two great feet at the back

ROSS BARKLEY

His movement is very good. The main thing is how players like him grow; how they manage the expectation from fans and press talking about how great they are. He finds good positions but has to be careful in possession.

No fear: Ross Barkley's movement in behind the striker could mean an influential impact

RAHEEM STERLING

I remember Liverpool’s academy director Frank McParland came to me and said ‘we MUST sign this kid he has great potential’.

Normally you pay around £200,000 for teenage players but we had to pay more. He has grown with games.

Confidence, ability and pace are his main attributes and when you have confidence you do the right things. Has the ability to start but could be very influential off the bench against a tired defence.

Teen at the time: But Benitez signed Raheem Sterling at Liverpool for a hefty fee

ADAM LALLANA

You can see he has a lot of talent. He has improved a lot and looks comfortable on the international stage. His quality on the ball and invention give England something different and his movement can keep Italy thinking.

Improvement: Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana has relished the step up in class with England

DANIEL STURRIDGE

People in Italy know Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard but this season they have taken notice of Sturridge and what he has done alongside Luis Suarez. He has confidence, belief and pace — that is a vital combination for a striker.

Worth a watch: Italy has noted Daniel Sturridge's performances for Liverpool this season
