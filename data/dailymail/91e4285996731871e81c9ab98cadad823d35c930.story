Two Hollywood starlets have controversially claimed that press intrusion is comparable to war and rape - in the space of just two days.

Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron likened press coverage to 'feeling raped', just days after Gwyneth Paltrow said online abuse was like the 'dehumanising' plight of soldiers going through war.

Both sets of remarks prompted a backlash on social media, with one charity which campaigns for sexual violence victims claiming Theron had 'trivialised' rape.

Controversial: The Hollywood actress Charlize Theron has compared press intrusion to rape in an interview

Meanwhile Cindy McCain - the wife of senator and 
former US Presidential candidate, John, who was a POW during the Vietnam
 war - labelled Paltrow a 'joke'.

She said: 'Gwyneth Paltrow is a joke. Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a
 joke! My 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her.'

South African-born Theron, who is in the
 UK to promote her new film A Million Ways To Die In The West, made the remarks after she was asked by Sky News if she ever 
googled herself.

During the interview, the 38-year-old said: 'I don’t do that, so 
that’s my saving grace. When you start living in that world, and doing 
that, you start I guess feeling raped.'

Asked by the interviewer if she felt 
that strongly about the issue, she said: 'Well, you know when it comes 
to your son and your private life. Maybe that’s just me.

'Some
 people might relish all that stuff but there are certain things in my 
life that I think of as very sacred and I am very protective over them.'

Backlash: One man reacted angrily to the actress's comments on Twitter

Days earlier, Paltrow had caused fury when she told a tech conference in Los Angeles: 'You come across [online comments] about yourself and about your friends, and it's a very dehumanising thing.

'It's
 almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanizing 
thing, and then something is defined out of it. My hope is, as we get 
out of it, we'll reach the next level of conscience.

'I
 see myself as a chalkboard or a whiteboard or a screen,' the star 
mused, 'and someone is just putting up their own projection on it.'

Since both sets of comments were made, social media sites have been awash with criticism for the two actresses.

Twilight
 star Kristen Stewart was forced to apologise when she made similar 
remarks in 2010 during an interview with Elle magazine.

Angry: Another user accused Theron of being a 'hypocrite' and 'disgusting'

Criticism: Jay Sawdy said the comparison was 'ill-advised at best'

Speaking about Theron's comments, one Twitter user said: 'She should try telling that to a real rape victim'.

Another said:'How stupid to comment about press intrusion the same as being raped. Makes my blood boil!!'

Mark Merryweather said: 'How dare Charlize Theron compare press intrusion to rape - try telling a victim of rape that.'

Zenobia
 Bharmal added: 'So Charlize Theron compared Press intrusion to rape 
whilst giving an interview to a member of the press... she's a hypocrite
 and disgusting.'

Joint criticism: A Twitter uses condemns both Charlize Theron and Gwyneth Paltrow. Earlier this week the Paltrow said receiving abusive comments online was like going to war

Katie Russell from Rape Crisis England
 and Wales told Mail Online: 'To us, it is always disappointing when 
someone high profile uses that language and turns sexual violence into a
 metaphor for something else.

'It is never appropriate and it trivialises the experience of sexual violence.

'The
 experience is devastating, as we have come to learn working with women 
who have been through it, and the impact can be life-long or very long 
term.

'Press intrusion is a very difficult experience but it is not appropriate to compare it to sexual violence.

'It's particularly disappointing in this case because Charlize Theron has campaigned against sexual violence before.

'She doesn't really have an excuse and it will upset people who have survived attacks.'

Marni Mulholland, a victim of sexual violence, told Mail Online: 'Flippant use of the word 'Rape' has somewhat devalued its devastating impact and so we must all be careful how we use it.'

One user described the actress as a 'stupid woman' after comparing the 'complete opposites'

Idiotic: Another user was shocked by the remarks made during the interview

'Vain': A woman advises the actress to 'Get back into the real world' after hearing the comments

'Stupid statement': Another user joins the backlash on social media by saying: 'I'm pretty certain that press intrusion is not at all like rape.'

'No idea': One woman's reaction to the controversial statement was straight to the point

Condemnation: Gary Spence says the actress's comments were 'tasteless and shallow'

The author of Raw, a book about her 
experiences, added: 'I am sure as an intelligent and insightful woman, 
Charlize Theron understands what rape truly is.

'Unsolicited
 press intrusion is one of the downsides of fame and Charlize Theron 
regrettably used the wrong word to describe it.'

Charlize, who is mother to two-year-old 
son Jackson, recently opened up about her ‘unexpected’ romance with the 
53-year-old actor Sean Penn.

The pair began a relationship at the end of last year and flew to Hawaii to celebrate New Year's Eeve together.

There
 have been reports in the press that he is ready to propose, but in 
previous interviews she has vowed not to walk down the aisle until 
same-sex marriage is legalised in the US.

In 1999, the actress appeared in an advert in South Africa where she outlined the country's shocking rape statistics.

A
week before news of her 'conscious uncoupling' from husband Chris 
Martin broke, 41-year-old Paltrow also infuriated working women across America 
when she said they had it easier than famous mothers.
