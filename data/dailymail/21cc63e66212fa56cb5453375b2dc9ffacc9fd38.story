Jose Mourinho has provided the clearest indication yet that he will recommend Chelsea offer skipper John Terry a new 12-month contract.

It is club policy to offer over-30s only one-year deals, and 34-year-old Terry’s existing arrangement expires at the end of the season.

The Chelsea captain remains a first-choice member of Mourinho’s squad, forming a formidable partnership with Gary Cahill in central defence.

Chelsea’s manager will make his recommendations to the Blues hierarchy regarding Terry’s contractual situation nearer the end of the season. And the Portuguese has given a major hint that Terry will be offered a new deal after claiming the former England captain could play for at least three more years.

‘Every individual is an individual,’ said Mourinho. ‘There are old players at the age of 22. I know some — 22 and old. I know young guys at 36 or 37. John is one of them. I had Javier Zanetti at Inter who was already 37. When the other guys came after a day off from training, he’d run from his home to burn the energy from his day off. I don’t know (how long Terry can play). You never know when. The important thing is that, tomorrow, it’s the next match and he’s in great condition to play.’

Mourinho’s second spell in charge at Stamford Bridge has given Terry a new lease of life when it looked as if his Blues career was fizzling out under Rafa Benitez.

And the Special One, who also insisted Eden Hazard’s new contract will be settled soon, provided a simple explanation.

‘Our training methodology helps. The way he is taking care of himself is very important too,’ Mourinho said, ‘but the most important thing of everything is to be happy. I read a famous neurologist who said, “We docs always say do some exercise, eat properly, be careful with salt, be careful with this protein, but we forget to tell people the most important thing: be happy.”

‘John had a period here of so many doubts, question marks. Is he still the same player? Can he play at this level? Is he fit? Will he play or be in the stands?

‘Then, suddenly, the happiness arrives and look at him. It’s been a process. When I arrived we played a European Super Cup and he was not playing. At that moment, he was happy but he was not ready for the high level. So it was also a process. But the reality is he played so well last season and this season, too.’

Meanwhile, Belgium keeper Thibaut Courtois has been ruled out of today’s home match with Hull City with a minor leg injury, paving the way for Petr Cech to make his first Premier League start this season.

Insisting that Cech will not be leaving next month, Mourinho said: ‘He doesn’t need to prove anything to me, the club, his team-mates, to supporters. It’s comfortable to know our goalkeeper tomorrow is Petr Cech.’
