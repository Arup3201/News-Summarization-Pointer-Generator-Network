Southampton have unveiled their new third kit ahead of Saturday's Premier League game with Newcastle.  

The bright yellow strip will be worn for the first time during the match at St. James' Park. 

It has been decided that both of the Saints' regular kits clash with the Magpies' home strip, meaning that the third kit, which is sponsored by MUVI, the camera series made by the club's main sponsor Veho, will get its first run out.

Ronald Koeman's side currently sit third in the Premier League table, as they vie to qualify for next season's Champions League.

Newcastle, meanwhile, are tenth and still in the hunt for a new Head Coach after Alan Pardew joined Crystal Palace earlier this month.   

Southampton beat Newcastle 4-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in September.
