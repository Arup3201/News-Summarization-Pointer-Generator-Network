She shot to fame as the bushy-browed model with a versatile look that made every designer want her to front their campaign.

And judging by these never-before-seen snaps of Cara Delevingne's grandmother, her good looks didn't come out of nowhere.

The 20-year-old supermodel took to Instagram to share vintage and present day photographs of her mother's mother, saying 'Happy 101st birthday to the most inspirational woman in the world!! My granny Gaga #lookatthosebrows.'

So THAT's where the eyebrows came from! Cara Delevingne uploaded this vintage snap of her grandmother to Instagram; the pair look almost identical

Just one glance at the snaps show that Cara is the spitting image of her grandmother, and reveals exactly where those iconic brows came from.

In another snap to celebrate her grandmother's big birthday, she wrote: 'My granny is a legend, she knows exactly how to make me smile! #happybirthdaygaga #101.'

She also made a montage of young snaps of her grandmother as well as modern day ones of her in hospital with the caption: 'Gaga! You look the exactly the same sipping on your whiskey #Legend #101'.

Cara's grandmother, the Honourable Margo Delevingne, married Edward Dudley Delevingne in 1937.

Like Cara, she was strikingly beautiful, and the similarities between the two are obvious in the black and white snaps her grand-daughter put on Instagram.

Born Angela Margo Hamar Greenwood, she was the first of four children born to the 1st Viscount Greenwood, a Tory MP, and his wife, Margery Spencer.

While we are more accustomed to seeing her stomp down the runway or partying with Rihanna, these candid Instagram photos give Cara's two million followers a rare insight into her family life.

High society: Cara's granny Margo, who was 101 this week, was the daughter of an aristocrat and Tory MP

Just last week she was partying into the early hours at Glastonbury with the likes of Suki Waterhouse, Alexa Chung and Rita Ora.

But
clearly the youngster doesn't need any rest: she has been 
hard at work as the face of yet another high-fashion campaign.

The
20-year-old model has just been unveiled as the face of Fendi's 
Autumn/Winter 13 campaign, adding to a burgeoning list that already includes Mulberry, Saint Laurent and YSL beauty.

The campaign, named Roman Skyline, was shot by Cara's close friend and Chanel creative director, Karl Lagerfeld.

The two are said to be firm friends and the model, who is rumoured to carry a Karl doll with her at all times, recently starred in a promotional video for Chanel.

Speak to ELLE 
about Cara, Lagerfeld said: 'Cara represents the modern It girl. Some people say she’s the new Kate Moss, which I think is ridiculous.

'Cara
is different. She’s full of life, full of pep. I like girls to be wild 
but at the same time beautifully brought up and very funny.'
