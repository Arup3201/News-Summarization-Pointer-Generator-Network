A British family are being forced to sell their house after Italian authorities seized their £250,000 holiday home illegally built on agricultural land.

Brendan and Jane Crossan fell in love with the Ligurian Riviera and in 2006 bought a cottage where they planned to spend school and university holidays with their three boys.

But seven years later, the perfect property deal has become a holiday home from hell, after authorities seized the villa.

Dream holiday home from hell: Brendan and Jane Crossan fell in love with the Ligurian Riviera and in 2006 bought a cottage where they planned to spend school and university holidays with their three boys

The couple from Ashtead, Surrey, have also been charged with owning an illegal property- a criminal offence that carries in Italy a penalty of two years in prison or a 50,000 (£42,000) euro fine.

After a five-year legal battle, police yesterday sequestered their cottage, overlooking the pretty medieval village of Dolcedo, giving the family just sixty days to remove their possessions and get out.

To make matters much worse Brendan, a social housing director, 52, and Jane, an NHS nursing manager, 48, will be forced to sell their home in the UK as well, as they will no longer be able to pay off the mortgage as planned.

They had invested their entire endowment, which was to pay off the remainder of their mortgage when they retired, in the second home.

The couple have also had to take out a second mortgage on the UK home to pay almost £20,000 in legal fees

In a cruel irony, at the time of purchase, the family were featured in the travel section of a British newspaper advising others to buy second homes in Italy instead of France where prices are much higher.

The nursing manager, who works for Sutton and Merton Community Services, said they had no qualms about buying in Italy.She said: ‘From the moment we stood on that terrace and looked out we knew it was the one. It was the views, the house, the position, everything. We looked at each other and thought -this is it.’‘We weren’t worried about buying abroad. We’d seen “Holidays from Hell” and stuff but we thought that was just Spain.’

After the purchase, the Crossans integrated into the village community, making friends and learning Italian.

Holiday fun: The couple's three sons, Dan, 25, Tom, 23 and Paddy, 10, loved coming there for cycling, days on the beach, and the area¿s famous Pasta alla Pesto

Their three sons, Dan, 25, Tom, 23 and Paddy, 10, loved coming there for cycling, days on the beach, and the area’s famous Pasta alla Pesto.

But two years later, at Christmas-time 2008, the couple received an email from the previous owners, advising them to get a lawyer immediately.

The house was one of 81 properties in the area that had been built on designated agricultural land. Many of them were second home belonging to foreigners. All had been given planning permission by the council, which had now been revoked by the regional government.

‘It’s all so terribly unfair. We weren’t the people who built the house- we bought it in good faith'

Mrs Crossan said: ‘It’s all so terribly unfair. We weren’t the people who built the house- we bought it in good faith.

‘When I watch things like this on television you think “How could they let this happen? Why didn’t they do things properly?” But we did everything properly.’

The NHS manager said she ‘still loves Italy’. She said: ‘It’s like unrequited love when you’ve been finished with by a boyfriend.’

But her husband countered: ‘Given the choice, I would sell the house and never come back.’

The experience has caused the couple enormous stress. Most crushing were the criminal charges for which the experienced nurse had to fly over especially.

She said: ‘When I was served the papers I felt like I was having a heart attack. I had palpitations. I couldn’t breathe. I felt as if my hearing was going and that I was going to faint.’

She added: ‘I felt as if I was in a documentary that I didn’t want to be in.’

The couple now have ten days to appeal to Italy’s highest court. If the appeal fails the house is likely to be demolished within months. They are the only Brits involved although there are many other foreigners.

Four notaries who signed the original documents have been placed under investigation.

But incredibly, the mayor and council committee of Dolcedo who authorised the building are not facing charges, as the statute of limitations has run out for that offence.

Those affected have organised several protests.

Organiser Barbara Gibellini, who stands to lose her only home, said: 'The worst thing is that the ones that pay are the ones who are victims of the situation. We are not guilty. We haven't done anything.'

'All of us that have bought these houses have bought them on land which has not been cultivated for years, abandoned land. We have all planted things. I have 15 olive trees from which I make oil.'
