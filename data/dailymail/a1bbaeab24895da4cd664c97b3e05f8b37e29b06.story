Grainy satellite images have given fresh hope to the families of seven crew members missing after they sailed into a storm off New Zealand in June.

When the official search for the crew of the Nina, including American David Dyche, his wife Rosemary and their 17-year-old son David, was called off in July relatives enlisted a private rescue team.

Private company Texas EquuSearch spotted what appears to be the 85-year-old wooden schooner drifting about 184 nautical miles off the coast of Norfolk island, near New Zealand on September 15.

They are now trying to plot its course before doing an aerial search.

'This is what we've been waiting for,' said Robin Wright, whose 19-year-old daughter Danielle is one of the six Americans and one Briton missing.

Her husband, Ricky, told ABC knowing their only child was lost at sea was  'a nightmare I can't wake up out of'.

Despite the satellite image appearing to show a vessel the same size and shape as the historic 85-year-old Nina, New Zealand authorities have so far refused to relaunch an active search for the crew.

Officials told the New Zealand Herald they would need better quality images before resuming the search for the Dyche family, Danielle, 73-year-old Evi Nemreth, 27-year-old Kyle Jackson, and 35-year-old Briton Matthew Wootton.

Mr Wootton, a Green Party activist who refuses to fly for environmental reasons, was on the final leg of a three-year round-the-world trip when he boarded the yacht in Opua, on New Zealand’s North Island, on May 29.

His father Ian, who lives with his wife Sue in Orpington, Kent, said they had mixed emotions about the new images.

He told the New Zealand Herald: 'You get the elation of yep, this looks like a really good image. But also the downside of: How are you going to find it again?'

A MetService spokesman said weather 
patterns since the image was taken on September 15 would need to be 
traced so gauge where the schooner may have drifted to.

Once the direction of the object pictured in the image is determined, private pilots will be hired to do an aerial search.

Families
 of the missing crew have been left frustrated at the slow response from
 New Zealand authorities to the new information.

'[Authorities] have never said that the Nina has definitely sunk,' said Ian Wootten, whose 35-year-old son Matthew is missing.

'We
 feel they are not going to be convinced by a satellite photo until they
 can see seven people holding their passports up,' he added.

'We can provide them with the data and say this is what the Nina looks like - you can see it's the same shape as the image. They have to be prepared to have a look at it,' Mr Wooten said.

The last contact anyone had with the Nina's crew was a text message sent by environmental scientist Ms Nemreth which wasn't received until nearly a month after she sent it on June 4.

It read: 'Thanks storm sails shredded 
last night, now bare poles. Goining 4kt 310deg will update course info 
(at) 6PM'.

The crew had left New Zealand for Australia six days before their boat, which was built in 1928, went missing.

Voyage: The crew of Nina were attempting to sail from New Zealand to Australia

Adrift: The search for the missing schooner, which left Opua in May, has centered on the Tasman sea

The crew of the Nina, a 70ft schooner, were sailing from Opua in New Zealand to Newcastle in Australia.

On board were six Americans and one Briton.

Six days into their voyage, on June 4, the crew sailed into a storm, which shredded their sails.

A text message sent on June 4 suggested the sailors had weathered the storm.

New Zealand authorities called off the official search on July 4.

On September 15, a private search company hired by relatives spotted an object on a satellite image believed to be the NIna.

The missing crew are Captain David Dyche, 58, from Panama City, Florida; David's 60-year-old wife, Rosemary and their 17-year-old son David Jr.

Also on board is Kyle Jackson, a 27-year-old from Bassett, Nebraska; Evi Nemeth, a 71-year-old from Boulder Colorado; Danielle Wright, a 19-year-old student from Baton Rouge, Lousiana; Matthew Wooten, a 35-year-old environmentalist from the UK.

Authorities believe the
 Nina likely sank in a storm on the day the text message was sent.

They 
continued their search until July in the hope survivors may have made it
 on to a life raft or to land.

The ship had been 370 miles off Cape Reinga when the crew encountered a storm with 68mph winds and 26ft swells.

The boat's captain Mr Dyche, from Florida, was an experienced sailor who had completed transatlantic journeys in the past.

Despite her young age, Louisiana psychology student Danielle has also sailed a lot, spending two years at sea in the Caribbean with her parents when she was 16.

Everyone on board is said to be experienced in survival, giving hope that they may be alive and drifting in the Tasman sea, awaiting rescue.

Nigel
 Clifford, Maritime New Zealand's general manager of safety and response
 services, said earlier this year that the text message indicated the Nina's crew would update their position
 about six hours later.

But it was the last confirmed contact from the schooner.

'While
 it shows that Nina had survived the storm up to that point, very poor 
weather continued in the area for many hours and has been followed by 
other storms,' Mr Clifford said in a statement.

Authorities
 didn't state why the text message went undelivered.

Mrs Wright said: 'We
 have never lost hope that the crew of Nina is alive and well and that 
they will be rescued, but seeing that boat image is very exciting. It's 
not a perfect system, but it's all we have at the moment.'

The families of those on board have a Facebook page and Go Fund Me website to help raise funds to continue their private search.

'Private
 searching costs run between $10,000-$20,000 per day, and there's still a
 lot of area that needs to be covered,' Mrs Wright wrote on a page dedicated to finding Danielle.
