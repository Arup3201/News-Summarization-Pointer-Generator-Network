Two officers are to be questioned by detectives after an anti-BNP protestor claimed police broke her leg during a Unite Against Facism rally in London.

Amy Jowett, an English language teacher from east London, alleges that an officer kicked her three times with such force that it broke her leg during the rally in Parliament Square.

Now the Metropolitan Police has confirmed two officers are to be interviewed as part of the investigation into the alleged assault during the Unite Against Facism demonstration on June 1, last year.

Ms Jowett, 35, claims she received life changing injuries during the rally, having had to endure seven operations and warned by doctors that by the time she is 45 she will need to have a knee replacement.

She had been one of around 1,000 anti-fascists who blocked a road outside Parliament to stop BNP supporters marching to the Cenotaph in Whitehall.

Officers are alleged to have started pushing the anti-fascist demonstrators back in the direction of Whitehall, telling the protestors they were in breach of the Public Order Act.

Ms Jowett claims that as police approached to arrest a man she had linked arms with, another officer kicked her left leg - forcing her knee in the opposite direction.

She suffered a compound fracture and was taken to St Thomasâ€™ Hospital after being treated by police medics at the scene.

A Met spokesman said the police investigation was being overseen by watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and that a file would be prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service.

'As part of the ongoing investigation into the incident involving Amy Jowett two MPS officers will be interviewed,' she said.

'The investigation, which is being supervised by the IPCC, has involved extensive work to try to ascertain what happened. This has included specialist work on video footage to seize images frame-by-frame.'

The spokesman, who said police are still appealing for witnesses to the alleged incident to come forward added: 'Once the interviews are complete a report will be compiled for the CPS.'

On June 28 last year, Ms Jowett made a complaint that a police officer had injured her.

'Officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards are investigating and as part of enquiries have been appealing for people who were at the demonstration at around 4pm that day and saw what happened to contact them,' said the spokesman.

'To remind people at the time the injury was received efforts were being made to move demonstrators away from Parliament Square. Warnings were being issued and the crowd was surging.

'A number of officers have been interviewed who were in the vicinity at the time.

'The IPCC has been informed of the complaint and are supervising the investigation.

'The MPS is taking the allegation extremely seriously and is appealing to anyone who has any information that could aid the investigation to come forward.'

Ms Jowett has only recently gone back to work teaching immigrants in Hackney.

'I can only hope these concluding stages 
will be conducted as quickly as possible and that the man who assaulted 
me will be brought to justice,' she told the Evening Standard.

She added: 'The last year of my life has been 
completely consumed with recovery from the assault, now my priority is 
doing everything I can to prolong the need for the inevitable knee 
replacement surgery.'

Felix Couchman of legal firm TV Edwards, who is representing Ms Jowett, said: 'It remains of vital importance that the 
perpetrator of the assault on Amy, who was taking part as a peaceful 
demonstrator and who sustained life-changing injuries as a result, is 
fully held to account.'
