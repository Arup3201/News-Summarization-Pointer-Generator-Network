Usain Bolt has set the pace for Rio 2016 with a 10-second 100m win on Copacabana beach two years before the Olympics.

The world's fastest man was in Rio de Janeiro for the Mano a Mano sprint against British sprinter Mark Lewis Francis, American Wallace Spearmon and Brazilian Jefferson Liberato Lucindo.

Bolt, 27, thrilled crowds on a specially-built track on the famous beach with a time of 10.06, dancing samba after his win. His World Record stands at 9.58 seconds.

Team GB sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis, from Birmingham, came second with a time of 10.43 in his last race of the season.

He said racing against Bolt was like nothing else.

'I've known Bolt for a long time,' he said. 'It's different from racing against anybody else because he makes you feel calm and you do better when you feel calm.'

Lewis-Francis, 31, who has recently moved back to Birmingham to train for 2016 after missing out on London 2012 through injury, said he hoped to be back for Games in Rio.

'It felt good, this was a great opportunity to come out here and race, it's my first time in Rio,' he added.

'Things are looking good, I'm a bit older now, I'm focused, so let's hope I'll be here.'

Meanwhile, Bolt confirmed he had delayed his retirement for a year after his sponsors asked him to keep competing for another year.

'I think my sponsors have asked me to do one more year, so I'll do 2017,' he said.

'Then I want to try professional football to see if I'll be any good. I think I will be but you never know.

'When it comes to being a coach, no, I've seen what I've put my coach through. I don't want to go through that with another athlete. I just want to be a lazy person.

'I'm looking forward to coming to Rio. Every country has a different ways, you did an extremely good job for the World Cup so it should be easier now because you've done a big event now. For me, I've come here with an open mind. The people are great and the weather is wonderful.'

American Richard Browne won the Paralympic race while Brazilian Rosângela Santos won in front of a home crowd in the women's 100m.
