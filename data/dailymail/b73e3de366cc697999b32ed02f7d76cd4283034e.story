Russia's female prisoners are being subjected to 'concentration camp' conditions where as many as 30 inmates are forced to share one room, a damning new book reveals today.

Convicts tell of a 'devastating lack of personal space' and the 'awful' experience of having to share just two toilets with 300 fellow inmates.

Others have been punished for soiling their bed sheets with menstrual blood after their period started unexpectedly.

'Awful': Russia's female prisoners say they are being subjected to a 'devastating lack of personal space in concentration camp-style conditions, according to a new book (file picture)

Their accounts have been documented in the book Before and After Prison: Women’s Stories by a group of St Petersburg sociologists who have combined uncensored stories by inmates with a professional assessment of life behind bars.

Russia's penal colonies have been examined before, but mainly by lawyers and human rights advocates and never analysing gender differences.

One prisoner known only as Galina, whose story features in the book, said: 'There were thirty of us sharing the same room in the colony. It was awful and really felt like barracks.

'And there was only one toilet room — with two toilets in it — per one detachment of three hundred people, who had a total of half an hour in the morning to use this toilet. It was a concentration camp'.

She said they were forced to boil rainwater after being left without any drinking water.

According to The St Petersburg Times, the book also describes how the women are put through a series of ordeals designed to suppress their femininity.

Sociologist Natalya Goncharova, a co-author of the book, said: 'There are rules in jails stipulating that if you soil your bed sheets — for example, with menstrual blood — you will be punished for it.'

Galina recalled how inmates are sometimes not allowed to was or shower after having an unexpected period until the next day.

The book also dispels the myth that female prisoners are softer towards each other than their male counterparts.

'If you are ill, or weak or old, they will be sure to exploit you, humiliate you, harass you, sometimes just for fun,' recalls one prisoner called Yulia.

According to official statistics, Russia's total prison population this year was 714,000, with women representing 59,000 of them, or 8.3 per cent.
