Claims: Bill Roache pictured yesterday leaving Preston Crown Court, where he was accused of twice raping a 15-year-old girl

William Roache pushed a schoolgirl on to a bed at his family home and committed a ‘cold, calculating’ rape, a court heard yesterday.

The veteran Coronation Street star targeted the 15-year-old a second time during the summer of 1967, pinning her up against a wall and, in a ‘quick fumble’ that lasted a matter of minutes, raped her again, a jury heard.

However, she came forward only last year after watching a television interview in which Roache spoke of how ‘there have been lots of women in my life’, which she said ‘made my skin crawl’.

Roache, 81, who has appeared as Ken Barlow since the ITV1 soap’s launch in 1960, is also accused of indecently assaulting four girls more than 40 years ago, allegedly exploiting his celebrity status in the belief they wouldn’t speak out.

Wearing a dark blue suit and striped tie, he sat impassively in court as the allegations were outlined on day three of his trial.

Yesterday, the jury heard from a 62-year-old woman who told how as a schoolgirl she joined autograph-hunters calling at the bungalow Roache shared with his first wife, Anna Cropper, in Haslingden, Lancashire.

But on one evening after school in 1967, she said, she went to the house and asked about their newborn daughter Vanya, and Roache invited her into the living room where they stood chatting.

At the time, she said, she was ‘just a kid’, a 15-year-old virgin who dressed in a T-shirt, skirt and socks and enjoyed playing hide and seek and hopscotch.

She said the actor led her to a darkened back bedroom where she expected to be shown the baby, but instead he pushed her onto a double bed and climbed on top of her.

‘He didn’t kiss me, nothing,’ she said in a police interview played to the jury at Preston Crown Court. ‘He was very cold and calculating.’

She added: ‘I was a bit shocked. There was nothing to suggest that anything improper was going to happen. He was a friendly person.

‘I didn’t know what to do. I was panicking. I didn’t have to fight him. He was not aggressive in any way.’

She said that Roache put on a condom before raping her.

Unable to resist as ‘he was big, I was little’, she said she lay beneath him for as long as 45 minutes, with Roache ‘huffing and puffing’.

‘It just seemed to go on a long time,’ she said. ‘I was scared. I just remember trying to stare at the ceiling but it was dark. That awful feeling of him pinning me down.’

Afterwards, she said, ‘the door opened and I was allowed to go’.

The woman said that later that year Roache invited her into a cottage nearby to which he had a key, which proved to be a ‘big mistake’.

‘Of course, idiot that I was, I stopped inside the doorway, and before I knew it I had been grabbed again,’ she said.

This time she said Roache pushed her against the wall of the front room and raped her, only this time the alleged attack was over in a matter of minutes.

‘There was no intimacy leading up to it,’ she said, describing it as ‘just an instant thing’.

‘I can’t explain why I was so gullible,’ she added.

The woman said she had not reported the alleged attacks at the time because she feared no one would believe her.

‘I thought it had been my fault,’ she said, adding the attacks had left her feeling ‘frightened, ashamed and disgusted’.

She denied she had ‘fancied’ Roache but added ‘possibly he fancied himself’, describing how she would see him ‘with a golf club teeing off on his lawn’ when female fans came hoping for autographs.

Defendant: The veteran actor came to court with his family and security staff

She said she did not speak to the 
actor again until a chance encounter about ten years later when he was a
 judge on a baby show at a local carnival, she said.

Walking past her, 
she said he stopped and said: ‘Oh hello, I know you, don’t I?’

Following
 the Jimmy Savile scandal and allegations against the late MP Sir Cyril 
Smith in 2012, she said she was talking to her son who branded such 
claims ‘lies’, and asked: ‘Why’s this come to light now?’

She
 told him child victims would have been too scared to come forward in 
previous decades, and when he asked how she knew, she answered ‘because 
I’ve been in that position myself’, telling him she had been attacked by
 ‘Ken Barlow’.

In the dock: Coronation Street star Bill Roache is accused of two counts of rape and five indecent assaults dating back almost 50 years

Some time 
later, she said she was watching Roache interviewed on television by 
Piers Morgan.

Branding him ‘arrogant’, she added: ‘He was talking about 
the number of women in his life. He was quite amused by it all.

'It made 
my skin crawl, to be honest. It was just the way he laughed it all off.’

As
 a result, she contacted police in March last year. Her complaint led to
 Roache being charged with two counts of rape.

Following publicity over 
his arrest, four other women came forward alleging Roache had sexually 
assaulted them.

The woman 
said she suffered two strokes in 2002 which ‘wiped out’ part of her 
memory, but insisted she remembered the alleged rapes clearly.

The Crown
 say Roache ‘took full advantage of his stardom’ to sexually abuse the 
girls, confident his celebrity status would silence his ‘star-struck’ 
victims.

The widowed actor 
again attended court with his sons Linus, 49, and James, 28, and 
daughter Verity, 32.

Roache, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies five counts 
of indecent assault and two of rape involving five girls aged 16 or 
under.

The trial continues.
