As Ryan Lochte wins gold after gold at the London Olympics, finding his way into the hearts and minds of Americans, his family is wrapped in inner turmoil.

MailOnline can reveal today that his younger brother, Devon, 22, a one-time strong aspiring swimmer, was busted for allegedly selling marijuana to a police informant earlier this year in Florida.

Devon had once announced to the world that he hoped to compete alongside his brother on an Olympic relay team some day.

But those dreams were dashed when Devon abandoned swimming a year ago, leaving his teammates and coaches wondering why someone with so much potential would leave the sport he was born into.

And in another setback for the family, the brothers' father, Steve, 60, who served as their coach, was arrested for a DUI, it was revealed today.

Accused: The MailOnline can reveal that Devon was busted for allegedly selling marijuana to a police informant earlier this year, a felony in Florida

Gainesville police told the MailOnline that the incident was Devon's first run in with the law. He was living with his big brother Ryan at the time while attending the University of Florida.

'He
 sold a confidential source two grams of cannabis for 40 bucks,' Officer
 Ben Tobias, spokesman for the Gainesville Police Department told the 
MailOnline.

The confidential source, Officer Tobias said, could have been an undercover officer or a police informant.

The sale allegedly occurred on January 10 of this year, but charges were not brought until February 14. The exchange was recorded with audio and video, the complaint against him read.

Devon Lochte was accused of both marijuana possession and the intent to sell, a misdemeanor and a felony in Florida. Rather than go to trial, Devon agreed to perform 200 hours of community service, records show.

He completed 75 hours by July 5 and had to get special permission from the court to watch his brother in the Olympics, documents reveal.

But Devon isn't the only Lochte to have a run in with the law.

Steve Lochte, the father that inspired his boys to swim, was arrested in 2010 for a DUI.

Officer Tobias said that an officer saw Mr Lochte swerving all over the road on April 11 in a white Toyota Landcruiser. The car had run up against the curb and several tires were blown, the report raid.

'An officer stopped him. Lochte was 
stumbling,' Officer Tobias said. 'They conducted field sobriety 
exercises and he was charged with a DUI on the scene.'

'We have a silent goal. We never really told anyone, but we want to be in the Olympics on
 the same relay team.'

An officer described Mr Lochte as having 'very watery bloodshot eyes and very mumbled and slurred speech,' in the official complaint, adding that he also had a 'strong odor of alcohol.'

The officer then asked Mr Lochte how much he had to drink, to which Mr Lochte replied 'A couple,' according to the records.

Mr Lochte consented to a breathalyzer at the scene and blew a .207 and a .217.

'That's over double the legal limit,' Officer Tobias said. 

In
 Florida, .08 is the legal limit. A misdemeanor DUI would mean that Mr 
Lochte was stripped of his license for one year, Officer Tobias said.

With Ryan Lochte's family's 
transgressions on full view, Officer Tobias added that the swimmer is a 
true inspiration, despite his family's struggles.

'I've had the chance to meet him on a couple of occasions,' Officer Tobias said. 'He is genuinely a nice guy.'

He also said that Ryan has a perfect police record: a blank one.

'Ryan has no incidents, no arrests... He's been the victim of a couple of crimes,' Officer Tobias said. 'Just minor stuff, like thefts.'

In an interview with ESPN, Devon Lochte told of his aspirations to follow in his brother's footsteps.

'We have a silent goal,' Devon said 
in 2009. 'We never really told anyone, but we want to be in the Olympics
 on the same relay team. That would be the best.'

Ryan Lochte, now 27, believed in his brother's dreams.

'I think he's going to be better than me,' Ryan said in 2009. 'I've seen it.'

'I could see him definitely going to the Olympics and being on the same relay. That would mean the world to me.'

Just about all of the Lochtes are swimmers. Parents Ileana 'Ike' and Steve Lochte are both swim coaches and sisters Kristin and Megan swam in college. Brandon, the youngest of the family, prefers basketball.

All have cheered on Ryan's amazing successes, though they weren't always obvious.

As a young boy, Ryan didn't take swimming seriously, goofing off in the pool during his father's lessons. He started to focus on his swimming at Spruce Creek High School.

He went on to have a storied, All-American career. He holds the world record in the 4x200 meter freestyle relay and the world record in the 200-meter individual medley and the 400-meter individual medley.

He has been named the World Swimmer of the Year once and both the American Swimmer of the Year and the FINA Swimmer of the Year award twice.

With 59 medals from international competition, 39 gold, elven silver, and nine bronze, he beat out Michael Phelps this week for the gold in the 400 IM and is often referred to as 'the best swimmer in the world.'

He made headlines when it was 
reported that he wanted to wear a custom tooth grill, bedazzled with 
diamonds, to collect his first medal in London.

The younger Lochte, who lives with Ryan, had hoped to make it to London in 2012 and in a way he did - on the sidelines.

Martin Wylby, a University of Florida assistant coach, helped train both Ryan and Devon on the team.

He coached Ryan for all four years of his college career and Devon for just two.

'He could have been a decent college swimmer,' Mr Wylby said to the MailOnline. 'He'd only scratched the surface, so you never know where the potential was going to take him.'

Mr
 Wylby said that despite how close the team was, Devon retired a year 
ago, saying that he wanted to 'concentrate on his schoolwork.'

Noting that Mr and Mrs Lochte are both swim coaches, Mr Wylby said that Devon could have been destined for Olympic greatness.

'It's hard enough to make it, but for
 two siblings, it would have been very hard,' Mr Wylby said. 'It wasn't 
out of the realms of possibility.'

Devon was a freestyler, swimming both the 100 and 200 meter races - just like his older brother, Mr Wylby said.

'At some point, something's got to give,' he said, adding that he had not heard about Devon's arrest.
