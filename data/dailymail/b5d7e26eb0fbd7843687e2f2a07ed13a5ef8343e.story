Tragedy: Six-year-old Sierra Newbold's death has been ruled a homicide Wednesday with an autopsy determining she had also been sexually assaulted

Police today launched a desperate hunt for the killer of 6-year-old Sierra Newbold, who was found dead in a canal near her West Jordan home, saying that no one has been ruled out of the search.

They are warning Salt Lake City residents to be vigilant for a sexual predator, after an autopsy report revealed Sierra had been sexually assaulted.

West Jordan Police Chief Doug Diamond warned parents to be on the lookout. ‘There is obviously a predator out there that is a monster, that has murdered a child,’ he said.

Investigators said that no one is ruled out for Sierra’s murder at this point, Desert News reported.

Little Sierra was discovered one hour after her mother reported her missing in the suburb of West Jordan and following an autopsy report it was confirmed she had been sexually assaulted.

'Our highest priority now is to identify, arrest, and successfully prosecute the person or persons responsible for this crime,' said Diamond

'I share in the concern of our residents for the ongoing safety and security of our children.'

The chief said he has increased police patrols in the area and is asking parents to take precautions to protect their children.

'If during the course of this investigation an imminent threat becomes known, we will share that information with our residents immediately,' he said.

Diamond said the girl’s parents have been cooperating in the investigation.

Officers found Sierra’s body in the canal about a block from her home, just 30 minutes after her mother “discovered she was not there and called us,” police Sgt. Drew Sanders said.

Sanders declined to comment on any possible motive in the case. Investigators also are withholding a precise chain of events leading to the girl’s disappearance.

'We haven’t come to any conclusion,' Sanders said. He said police have 'tons of leads' and 'it’s paramount we find out who did this.'

Police have said there were no signs of a break-in at the family’s home, and they declined to release any more details about the case.

'We don't have any idea' how Sierra 
disappeared or whether she was taken from the bedroom, her grandfather Reed Newbold told
The Associated Press. 'It's a complete mystery.'

The
parents 'are devastated by this,' he said. No working telephone number 
could be found for the parents. The grandfather declined to provide it.

Reed
Newbold said the family isn't suspected of being involved in the girl's
disappearance with them having been fully cooperative with 
investigators.

Homicide: Signs of foul play to the girl's body were not reported prior to the autopsy results released on Wednesday

'Our contacts at the FBI have been helping us with that. They’ve been working on enhancing that [surveillance video],' Mr Sanders told Fox 13.

'Right now, we do know that there are images on there and our investigators are analyzing that and trying to determine what use those are and if any evidence exists,' he said.

He declined to say how long Sierra had been dead before discovered by police and if the autopsy was able to collect any DNA evidence, so as to not jeopardize their investigation, according to the Salt Lake City Tribune.

Mr Sanders also declined to comment on any possible suspects or a motive in the case.

'We haven't come to any conclusion,' said Mr Sanders. He said police have 'tons of leads' and 'it's paramount we find out who did this.'

The girl's dad had left for work some
time before her absence was noticed but her mother. Her younger sister and 
elder brother were also at home.

According to West Jordan Police Chief Doug Diamond on Tuesday, 'there was not a significant amount of trauma on the body,' he said speaking to the Tribune, leading to them being initially uncertain of whether foul play had occurred or not.

Mr Sanders dismissed a neighborhood rumor on Wednesday that the girl's disappearance was connected to a weekend grass fire that gutted two houses and drew onlookers to the girl's neighborhood.

Reed Newbold said the onlookers possibly widen the field of suspects.

However, police determined the house fires were 'completely unrelated' to the girl's disappearance, Mr Sanders said.

Police have said there were no signs of a break-in at the family's home, located near 2400 West and 7100 South.

She was eager to grow up, drive, and get her 'very own' cell phone. She 
loved to draw and was an incredible artist at a very young age. She 
loved dancing, hiking, and being active. She loved life and lived it to 
the fullest.

Funeral announcement for Sierra

Officers cordoned off parts of the 
neighbourhood and searched rubbish bins for evidence that may help piece
together what happened to the girl.

Dive teams were expected to be brought in to search the canal.

An announcement for the child's funeral scheduled for this Saturday described the child as quick to make friends while outgoing and a member of her local soccer team.

'She was eager to grow up, drive, and get her “very own” cell phone. She 
loved to draw and was an incredible artist at a very young age. She 
loved dancing, hiking, and being active. She loved life and lived it to 
the fullest,' it read.

'She had the amazing ability to make everyone happy with her 
big brown eyes and her beautiful smile.'

School: Sierra's family said the girl was looking forward to starting the first grade at West Jordan Elementary, pictured

The West Jordan community, where two houses burned to the ground on Saturday after a tree fell on a power line, was mourning the death of the young girl as well.

Neighbour, Claire Evenson, whose daughter was a school friend of Sierra, told Deseret News residents were struggling to come to terms with the sudden loss.

She described the girl as smart and full of life and said she loved to dance and play dress up. 'She was going to start first grade with my daughter,' Ms Evenson said.

'They were so excited for that. This is just hard for everyone to wrap their mind around.'

'We’re dedicated to trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Sierra,' Mr Diamond said during a news conference.

'Our hearts go out to the family of this young girl.'
