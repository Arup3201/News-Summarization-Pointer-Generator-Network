A woman who left her dog to starve for so long that it started eating its own faeces has been banned for keeping animals for 20 years.

Stacey Moran, 27, from Coatbridge, Scotland, admitted failing to provide proper care for her two-year-old cross breed Sasha.

When SPCA workers found the dog, she was locked in a filthy room covered in rubbish and excrement, with no available food or water.

She was so malnourished that her ribs were sticking out under her fur and she weighed just 10lb, when she should have weighed 15lb.

Stacey Moran, 27, has been banned from keeping animals for 20 years after the shocking neglect was discovered

Incredibly Moran tried to claim she had been away on holiday and left the dog in the care of a family member, and that they had neglected Sasha.

However an inspection by vets found that the level of malnutrition had developed over a much longer period.

Sasha was given a body score of just 1.5, with one being malnourished and five being obese.

Inspector Sam MacDonald said: 'Thankfully, Sasha made a full recovery in our care, gaining 2.35kg through simple, adequate feeding and we were delighted to find her a loving new home with a responsible owner.

'We are pleased Moran received a 20-year ban for the suffering she caused Sasha. She gave no reasonable explanation for Sasha's condition and therefore we considered this to be a case of gross neglect.'

Moran was sentenced at Airdrie Sheriff Court yesterday after pleading guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to her dog under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.

In another case of animal cruelty, last month a cruel owner dumped a puppy in a hedge on a freezing night with a note around its neck which read: 'Please look after me as my owner doesn't want me'.

Moran claimed she had been on holiday and left Sacha in the care of family who mistreated her, when in fact Moran kept her locked in a room in this flat block

Sacha, who has been renamed twink, has now been rehomed after being brought up to a healthy weight

The 14-month-old spaniel-pointer cross was locked in a cage and left in a bush by the roadside near Downham Market, Norfolk.

Luckily, a passer-by found the abandoned pet before he starved or froze to death, after hearing his yelps for help from the undergrowth.

Attached around his neck was the note, written in a childish scrawl, which continued: 'I'll try to do my best to keep you happy. My name is Snoopi.'
