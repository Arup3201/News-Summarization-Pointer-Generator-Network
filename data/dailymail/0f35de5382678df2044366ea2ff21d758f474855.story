The son of a sheriff's deputy has today pleaded not guilty to the brutal killing of a 16-year-old girl, despite earlier admitting to police he carried out the crime.

Robert Schwander, 17, of Traverse City, Michigan told police he did kill Carly Lewis but claimed her death had been an accident.

Miss Lewis was stabbed 10 times, the fatal blow being a near five-inch deep slash to her neck, according to a forensic pathologist.

On June 14 Schwander led police to the shallow grave site where Miss Lewis' bloodied body had been buried in sand at a public works yard.

That was after he confessed to killing the school girl following a lie detector test, police said.

Miss Lewis disappeared on June 2. She had been due to meet up with Schwander at around 6pm that day.

Police believe she was killed in a shack off the city's Beitner Street that same evening. Schwander then moved her body to the public works yard two days later, they added.

June 15 would have been the popular blonde teen's 17th birthday. Instead, an autopsy was being carried out on her body.

Miss Lewis' devastated mother Susie told the Record-Eagle that her family had known Schwander well and that he had been in the same class as her son, Mitchell.

Earlier this year she even welcomed Schwander into the family home to stay for a couple of months after he left his own.

'I brought him into my home, and that’s why it hurts so much,' Miss Lewis told the paper. 'It’s hard to fathom that somebody you know could do that. 
This isn’t easy.'

A 'Justice for Carly Lewis' Facebook group, that has so far attracted 2,835 people, turned from one of calls to find the teen to one of tributes today.

A friend of the girl put together a picture slideshow on YouTube while others took time to write heartfelt messages on the group's wall.

Lissa Velveeta Hromada wrote: 'Carly you were amazing so bright and full of life your smile would and could just brighten up a room.'

While Jaered Elwell wrote: 'Jail is meant specifically for these types of disgusting people, and honestly, he shouldn't be given the privilege to live.'

As a sheriff's deputy Schwander's father Scott, is reportedly a pillar of the community and is currently on paid leave following his son's arrest.

Schwander made his plea today via a video link from the Grand Traverse County Jail. 

His attorney Clarence Gomery said despite the teen calling Ms Lewis' death an accident, he recognises the 'seriousness and potential consequences' of it.

'You’re not talking about a hardened criminal here,' he said before Schwander's arraignment last week.

'You’re talking about confused kid who might have made a horrible mistake and is about to realise his whole life is going to be changed because of that horrible mistake.'

Schwander was denied bail and is due back in court on June 27.
