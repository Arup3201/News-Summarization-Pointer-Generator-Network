Neil Lennon quit as Celtic manager amid fears of cuts to his budget for the new season and the prospect of losing his most influential players ahead of a crucial Champions League qualifying campaign.

Just hours after Sportsmail exclusively revealed Lennon’s impending departure, the news was confirmed in a lengthy club statement.

Despite the amicable separation, it is understood there were frustrations behind the scenes.

Certainly, after leading the current Scottish champions to three successive titles and two Scottish Cups as well as a place in the last 16 of the Champions League, Lennon was left wondering how much further he could take Celtic. But those concerns were magnified by his fears he would not have the financial clout to make the Champions League group stage for a third successive year — especially if key players Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk are sold this summer.

Going out on a high: Neil Lennon has ended his four-year reign as Celtic manager

‘I have supported Celtic all my life 
and the club will always be part of me,’ said Lennon. ‘It was an 
absolute honour to play for this great club, to captain the team and of 
course to become Celtic manager, a position which I cherished dearly.

‘However, I feel the time is now right to move on to a new challenge.

‘Serving
 the club was always a privilege. I have always given my best and aimed 
to do all I can to ensure success for Celtic; as a supporter it was all I
 wanted.

‘I will assist 
the club in appointing my successor. As ever, we will need our fans’ 
support and I am sure they will give the club and the new manager the 
same great backing which they gave to myself.’

Now the search is on for a new boss with club legend Henrik Larsson strongly linked with the post.Larsson
 — currently in charge of Swedish club Falkenbergs — refused to rule 
himself out of the running last night and said: ‘I can see myself back 
at Celtic, but whether it’s now or in the future time will tell.’ 

Sportsmail
 understands, however, Celtic have also made discreet enquiries via 
third parties over former defender Malky Mackay’s availability.

Mackay joins Owen Coyle, Jackie McNamara and Steve Clarke on an exhaustive list of potential appointments.

Grateful: Lennon thanked all of his Celtic players as well as the 'magnificent' supporters

Former
 Manchester United manager David Moyes will not put himself forward as a
 candidate for the post, although Wigan boss Uwe Rosler is understood to
 be interested.

Lennon 
will fly off on a family holiday today to consider his options ahead of a
 stint as a BBC analyst at the World Cup Finals. He had been strongly 
linked with the Norwich City post but that job was last night given to 
Neil Adams, who had taken charge after Chris Hughton’s sacking.

Lennon’s agent Martin Reilly said: ‘He has nothing lined up. Neil just feels now is the time to move on to the next challenge.’

Celtic
 chief executive Peter Lawwell thanked Lennon for his efforts and said: 
‘When we appointed Neil as manager we did so knowing exactly what the 
club meant to him and knowing he would give all he had.

‘He has delivered great success to our supporters domestically and has brought us back to the table in European football.

‘He will always be a part of the club and we wish Neil and his family nothing but success in the future.’ Lawwell will be keen to find a replacement soon with Champions League qualifiers beginning in just eight weeks’ time.

‘We
 now embark on a new and exciting chapter for the club,’ Lawwell said. 
‘We are sure our fans will give us their usual support as we aim to 
bring them more and more success and continue to make Celtic a club they
 can be proud of.’

Returning hero? Henrik Larsson has been installed as favourite to become new boss

Larsson
 would be a popular appointment with the fans, although many question 
his lack of experience for filing a high-pressure post.

Sportsmail understands the Swedish icon is not a front-runner for the job despite bookmakers making the 42-year-old odds-on favourite.

‘When
 I stopped playing and went into management I knew the Celtic job was 
one that I would be linked with,’ Larsson said. ‘I have, and always will
 have, a strong affection with the club. It’s not a question of whether 
I’d be up for it.

‘At 
the moment I’m only focusing on the job at Falkenberg. I can see myself 
back at Celtic, but whether it’s now or in the future, time will tell.’

Falkenbergs
 sporting director Hakan Nilsson has already denied contact from the 
Parkhead club. Asked if he himself had held any talks, Larsson said 
enigmatically: ‘Let me put it this way, I always have had good contact 
with the people at Celtic and I continue to have good contact with the 
club.

‘That’s all I am going to say. It’s up to you to work out if there’s been contact.’

The
 Celtic legend took control of Falkenbergs in March after a spell at 
modest outfit Landskrona. Neither club compares to the scale or demands 
at Celtic and there is little in Larsson’s managerial career to suggest 
he should be appointed as Lennon’s successor.

In the running: Malky Mackay has been touted for a Celtic return too

Lisbon
 Lion Bertie Auld addressed those concerns when he said of the Larsson 
speculation: ‘Henrik Larsson is a fabulous name and the Celtic legions 
adored him as a player.

‘However, the club need a steady pair of hands at the moment, someone who can hit the ground running.

‘With the greatest of respect, Henrik is not that man.

‘Sure,
 he might put bums on seats, but my old club need a manager who can come
 in right away to take control and start to organise things.’

Meanwhile, Dundee United defender Andrew Robertson insisted his boss Jackie McNamara has unfinished business at Tannadice.

A
 former Celtic captain, McNamara has had an impressive first season on 
Tayside, and recently turned down an approach from Blackpool who were 
impressed by his work building a thrilling side packed with talented 
kids.

Yet while 
Robertson can understand why bigger clubs like Celtic would be very keen
 to land the 40-year-old, he expects McNamara to be his boss next 
season.

‘The manager is 
going to be linked with Celtic but I think he is happy at United — and 
he’s got unfinished business, as do we as players after the Scottish Cup
 Final defeat.

‘But I 
can understand 100 per cent why he would be linked. He’s had a good 
season and everyone is taking notice of his team’s style of play.’
