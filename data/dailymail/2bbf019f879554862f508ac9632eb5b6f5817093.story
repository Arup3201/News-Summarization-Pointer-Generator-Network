Fulham are signing Hellas Verona goalkeeper Nikolai Mihailov.

The 26-year-old is the son of former Bulgaria goalkeeper Boris Mihailov who played for Reading.

Fulham have held an interest in the Verona keeper since last year when his former club Liverpool were also linked with a return bid. 

Playing for keeps? Nikolay Mihaylov, playing here for Enschede, is wanted on loan by Fulham 

Fulham have held talks with free agent Timo Hildebrand but hope to agree a loan for Mihailov with a view to a permanent £400,000 deal.

Coach Felix Magath has put faith in a young squad but is under increasing pressure at Fulham after a poor start to the Championship season.

Tim Sherwood and former Celtic boss Neil Lennon are understood to be under consideration should Fulham make another managerial change.
