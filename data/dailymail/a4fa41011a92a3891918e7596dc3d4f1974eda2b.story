Once upon a time, a couple planted a rare shrub in their front garden.

For eight years, nothing happened until – lo and behold – it suddenly sprouted into this 20ft monster dubbed the Giant Beanstalk.

The agave Americana is already higher than its owners’ bedroom window and its amazing growth shows no sign of slowing.

Sharon McMullan, 54, and her 66-year-old husband Bill bought the plant at a garden centre.

It remained dormant for years, producing nothing but spiky green leaves.

But following a series of mild winters, it has unexpectedly burst into life – producing the towering stem in a matter of weeks.

Mrs McMullan, a grandmother from Paignton in Devon, said: ‘The flower prong is nearly as tall as the house. You can see it getting taller on a daily basis.

'It’s outside the bedroom window now and it doesn’t seem to have stopped yet.

‘We’re a little bit worried it could fall down in a storm and land on a neighbour’s car.

'But my grandchildren love it – they call it the Giant Beanstalk.’

She added: ‘I haven’t done anything special, I wouldn’t say I’m much of a gardener.’

Agaves – which are native to Mexico and used to make tequila – flower only once before the  plant dies.

During the flowering, a tall stem or ‘mast’ grows from the centre of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of short  tubular flowers.

A spokesman for the Royal Horticultural Society said:  ‘Normally they would be happier in hotter climates such as Spain or Portugal but mild winters here are protecting them and allowing them to flourish.’
