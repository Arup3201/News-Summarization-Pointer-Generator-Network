A multimillionaire car dealer is facing a third murder trial in connection with the disappearance of his estranged wife in 2001 - after two previous convictions were overturned.

Prosecutors described  businessman Calvin Harris from upstate New York  as callous and controlling on Thursday as he returned to court for the beginning of the case.

The 53-year-old has continually insisted he did not kill Michele Harris, 35, who vanished after leaving her waitressing job on the night of September 11 - the day of the terrorist attacks.

Prosecutors have no body, no murder weapon and a largely circumstantial case, but Tioga County District Attorney Kirk Martin told jurors that Harris, 'exercised the ultimate act of control' during a bitter divorce - from which his wife could have claimed half of his $4million fortune.

Another trial: Calvin Harris walks into the Schoharie County Courthouse in upstate New York to begin his third murder trial linked to the disappearance of his estranged wife in September, 2001 

Victim: He insists he did not kill Michele Harris, who vanished after leaving her waitressing job on the night of September 11, 2001

'Who had the motive to kill Michele? The defendant,' Martin said during opening statements. 'Who had the opportunity to kill Michele? The defendant. Who went on with their life as if Michele wasn't coming back? The defendant.'

Harris' lawyer, Bruce Barket, is set to make his opening remarks Monday.

Prosecutors have argued Harris killed his wife at their remote, 200-acre Southern Tier estate, where they slept in separate bedrooms. 

But defense lawyers contend prosecutors failed to provide a theory for how he could have killed her at the house they shared with their young children and then disposed of her body within the prosecution's time frame.

Support: Harris is pictured with his children, (from left) Taylor, 20, Jenna, 17, Cayla, 19, and Tanner, 15. The four teenagers have said they believe their father is innocent of killing their mother

Family: They are pictured with their children, who were between two and seven when she went missing

'The most outrageous thing that happened is the prosecution ignores the real evidence of who actually committed this crime,' defense attorney Bruce Barket said outside court. 'It is shocking in some ways. They're going to pursue Cal no matter what.'

Harris smiled and talked with his four children before court convened Thursday. They sat behind him at the trial.

Michele Harris worked as a waitress in 2001 as the couple was divorcing. Prosecutors contend that her estranged husband struck her after she returned from work to their home about 35 miles northwest of Binghamton on either the night of Sept. 11 or early the next morning.

Her empty minivan was found by the family's baby sitter around 7am September 12 at the bottom of the couple's quarter-mile driveway. 

Later that day, Harris told police they could search his home and his vehicles, according to court papers.

A prosecution expert later testified that small amounts of Michele's blood were found in the kitchen and garage of the house, some of it cleaned up. Prosecutors argue the blood splatters supported the theory that Calvin Harris hit his wife with a blunt object, imperfectly cleaned up and buried her somewhere in the woods.

Defense attorneys have argued that there was extremely small volume of blood and the age of the stains could not be determined.

By his side: Harris, pictured with Jenna, left, and Cayla, right, is currently out on bail after his conviction was overturned for the second time in 2012. He had previously been convicted of murder in 2007 and 2009

Emotional: In 2014, they appeared with their father as they appealed for information about the disappearance

It took a jury four hours to return a guilty verdict in 2007. Harris put his head down in court and sobbed, saying 'Oh my God. Oh my God.'

One day after the verdict, a local farmhand came forward to say he saw Michele Harris and a man in his mid-20s at the end of their driveway at about 5:30am on September 12, 2001. With that information, Harris' lawyers won him a new trial. The 2009 conviction in that trial was thrown out by New York's top court in 2012.

The Court of Appeals cited trial errors including the judge's handling of hearsay testimony and a prospective juror who acknowledged having a pre-existing opinion.

'I didn't have any involvement in Michele's disappearance,' Harris said during a news conference last year. 'I would never hurt the mother of my children, and I would never do anything to hurt them.'

Jury selection for the third trial finished this week in Schoharie County, more than 100 miles northeast of the Harris home in Spencer. Defense lawyers had argued for a change of venue, saying Harris couldn't get a fair trial where he was twice convicted.
