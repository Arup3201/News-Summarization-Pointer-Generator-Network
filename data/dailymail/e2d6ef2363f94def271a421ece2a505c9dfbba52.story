Jens Lehmann is confident Germany will win a fourth World Cup in their history when they face Argentina in Sunday's final.

The former German international goalkeeper believes Joachim Low's side have far too much for their South American counterparts even if they do boast the talents of four-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.

Too good: Jens Lehmann believes Germany will win a fourth World Cup at the expense of Argentina

Safe hands: Former international goalkeeper Lehmann won 61 caps for Germany

Fear factor? Lehmann believes Lionel Messi's talents will be overshadowed by Germany's attacking threat

'Yes, I’m sure of it,' Lehmann told FIFA.com. 'At the moment I’m frantically searching for a flight to Brazil because I’d love to be there.

'Messi is outstanding but Germany have got a more complete attack and they’ll break down the Argentinian defence, although they might have to be patient.'

The 44-year-old, who won 61 caps for Germany, has been impressed with his nation's strength in depth and believes that many of the squad's experience of playing in the Champions League will prove telling on the night in the pressure moments of the final.

'We’ve got the best team at this World Cup: we’re organised, compact and fantastic on the ball,' he added.

'You can tell that a lot of our boys, including some of the ones on the bench, are used to playing in the latter stages of the Champions League.

'You only need to look at the kind of big international games the Bayern players have been involved in over the last few years.

'That makes a huge difference because you gain a lot of experience from those sorts of encounters.'
