Take a rusty old boat, a few smoke bombs and a rather anticlimactic sinking. Put them together and, believe it or not, you have an art project that is judged to be worth £50,000 of taxpayers’ money.

Artist Simon Faithfull bought the 24ft Brioney Victoria on eBay for £75. He lit smoke bombs to make it look as if it was on fire, then opened its valves, filling it with water.

As it sank, he dived into the sea. And the point of this performance? The boat had been fitted with underwater cameras, which will film for a year as it grows into an artificial reef off the Dorset coast. Footage will be sent to a phone app so people can watch live, and will later be made into a film.

The REEF project will cost £120,000, nearly half funded by the Arts Council. The rest will come from European Union grants. Mr Faithfull, 48, the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: ‘A boat that was at the end of its life is now starting a new one.’

REEF was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, groups supported by the Arts Council. It cost £80,000 to sink the boat and consult marine experts, of which £32,000 came from the Arts Council. An extra £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton and France, of which the Council will pay half. 

The boat has been fitted with five underwater cameras which will record the 12-month journey of the ‘dead’ boat being brought back to life in the form of an artificial reef for marine life. The footage will be streamed live and a film will eventually be made and shown at art exhibitions.

But the project has been slammed by some after it emerged that nearly half of the £120,000 spent on the project has been funded by the British taxpayer through grants from the Arts Council.

It was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, two arts organisations in Brighton supported by the Arts Council.The remaining cost has come through European Union arts grants.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers struggling with rising bills will be baffled that they’ve been asked to pay to sink a boat in the name of art.

'If this project was worthwhile then private investment should have been sought. This sort of wasteful spending by unaccountable quangos and local authorities has to come to an end.'

The project, called REEF, has taken three years to come to fruition because of the level of planning and consultation from marine experts required.

Mr Faithfull, who is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: 'The idea was to take a boat and send her on a short journey to the bottom of the sea.

'I bought the concrete hull of a disused boat on eBay then added a concrete wheelhouse so it replicated a working boat. We had very strict permissions and the boat was stripped of anything that could potentially be harmful.

'I was on board the boat and we set up pyrotechnics to look like a fire so it looked like the boat was in trouble.

'Then I opened the seacocks and let water into the boat. As it went down I dived off to symbolise abandoning ship.

He explained that the boat has been rigged with five cameras that transmitted the sinking and will continue to transmit live for the next year so people can see it transform into a reef. 

The cameras will broadcast to a mobile app for a year and the film will eventually be shown at exhibitions in Brighton, Calais and Caen in France.

Of the £120,000 that the project cost, £80,000 went into buying, building and towing the boat and consulting with marine experts.

Of that money, £32,000 was funded by the Arts Council with the rest being met by grants from Interreg, a scheme funded by the European Regional Development Fund to encourage European projects to work together.

A further £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton, Caen and Calais, half of which will be met by the Arts Council and half by Interreg.

Laurence Hill from Fabrica, one of the main backers of the project, added: 'Eventually there will be an exhibition at Fabrica with an edited version of the film we took of the sinking.

'In was an amazing success and a real relief after all the planning that has gone into it. It was a relatively expensive project because of all the experts involved in it.

Mr Faithfull’s recent art projects have involved films of him walking through a burning plane and walking across the sea bed.

He also sent a chair to the edge of space beneath a weather balloon in the name of art.
