When Curiosity first touched down on Mars, Internet pranksters were quick to mock up photographs of alien life on the alien landscape.

But it seems Nasa has itself captured something very strange on camera, including a strange white light dancing across the horizon of the red planet, and four blobs hovering in the sky

While the images are certainly a curiosity, Nasa and photography experts insist that these are nothing more than blemishes on the images, picked up by the camera lens sitting on the rover at a distance of 350 million miles away.

So what are the Mars anomalies? View the videos below:

1) Some internet users claim to be able to see a speck of light rapidly traversing the Martian horizon n the images below

2) It may not look like much, but on the dry and barren Mars landscape, any movement is unexpected - and some claim to be able to see a light which apparently lifts itself off the ground below

3)
 On some returned images from the Curiosity, strange pinpoints appear in the 
sky - are they spaceships, or just abnormalities on the camera?

So far, Nasa has not commented on any of the strange sightings, but alien hunters have suggested these are alien ships monitoring our baby steps into the universe.

YouTube user StephenHannardADGUK, 
part of a group called Alien Disclosure UK, spotted the anomalies on the
 NASA images, publicly available on the space agency's website, and 
applied a series of filters to try to shed light on the mystery.

Referring to the four pin-points of light pictured in the skies of Mars (below), he
 said: 'Four objects caught by Mars Curiosity, very difficult to make 
out on original image so I have used a few filters to highlight.

'What are these four objects? UFOs, Dust particles, or something else? As always you decide.'

However video analyst 
 Marc Dantonio - who, in the interests of full disclosure, has worked on
 projects for the U.S. government - told the Huffington Post that these 
are simply 'dead pixels' in the image - a regular problem in the world 
of graphics.

Indeed, many computers and mobile phones develop dead pixel problems, as do modern digital camera.

Dantonio said: 'After watching the video, it is actually quite clear that these are one-pixel sized image anomalies.

'I fully concur at this point that these are dead pixels on the imager.

'All
 CCD [cameras] have them, and in a bland atmosphere like that at Mars, 
they would be very obvious as opposed to an active atmosphere like 
Earth, where they could end up hidden for a long time before anyone 
noticed them.'

Another video appears to show an object rising from the horizon, followed shortly afterwards by another small object.

NASA has not publicly commented on either 'sighting'.

Curiosity, a six-wheeled vehicle the 
size of a compact car, landed inside a vast, ancient impact crater near 
Mars' equator on August 6 after an eight-month, 354-million-mile voyage 
through space.

Earlier 
today, the rover was seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during 
final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars.

Engineers
 at mission control have been running a series of tests before the 
one-ton vehicle's first drive which is expected in the next couple of 
days.

The Martian motor was
 also shown flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time. The 
7-foot-long (2.1-meter-long) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a
 camera, a drill, a spectrometer, a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and
 portioning samples of powdered rock and soil.

The
 Mars rover Curiosity zapped its first rock on Sunday with a 
high-powered laser gun designed to analyze Martian mineral content, and 
scientists declared their target practice a success.

The
 robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist-sized stone nearby
 and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10-second period, NASA said in a
 statement issued from mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
near Los Angeles.

The strange shimmering lights seen by Curiosity: 

The original image from the NASA website: The 'UFOs' are faint in this image, but observable through adjusting the contrast and brightness

The YouTube video - posted by a Stephen Hannard - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence. A fourth blob can be seen to the top of this image

A close-up of the blobs: Are these glitches in the images - or something a bit more exciting?

Decide for yourself: UFOs or dead pixels?
