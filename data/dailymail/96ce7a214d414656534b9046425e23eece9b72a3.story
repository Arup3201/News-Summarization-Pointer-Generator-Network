Andy Carroll and captain Kevin Nolan face a frustrating challenge to win back their West Ham places despite returning this week from long-term injuries, boss Sam Allardyce has warned.

Carroll played 60 minutes in a practice match against Southend United at Chadwell Heath training ground on Wednesday lunchtime - his first appearance for the club since he injured his ankle ligaments on the club’s pre-season tour to New Zealand.

The club’s £15m record-signing, whose time at Upton Park has been plagued by injuries, may start on the bench for the visit of Aston Villa this weekend, but is expected to be back to full fitness at the end of this month.

However Allardyce has now stressed that given the Hammers’ outstanding start to the Premier League, he cannot promise his otherwise tried-and-trusted lieutenants, many of whom played in the club’s promotion-winning season of 2011-12, that they will get much game time this campaign.

Allardyce said: ‘Everybody faces a challenge (to start) compared to last season because of the strength-in-depth of the squad. Our squad has proven to be strong until now.

‘Even my trusted captain, Kevin Nolan, has found it difficult to break his way into the side and is extremely frustrated – as are a few of the sides.

‘Matt Jarvis, having returned from injury, is another player frustrated. So, too, Ricardo vaz Te and Joey O’Brien. These were my regular players last season. Because the other players have done so well while they have been away, it has been difficult for me to put (the regulars) back in based on our performances and results.

‘(Carroll’s availability) depends on how he feels when he gets in and trains tomorrow. That will be the deciding factor if he gets into the squad or not. Certainly, if he continues the way he is, then if not this weekend but by the end of the international break, he should be okay and ready to join the squad.

‘I have to manage any disappointment. I have to look at the individuals and make sure they stay focused and concentrated. The dynamic can change in a split-second and if players on the sidelines are not mentally or physically ready to step back into the team, then we all suffer. My responsibility is to keep the group focused and eager to wait for that opportunity to come.’

Senegal international Diafra Sakho, scorer of seven goals in eight matches this season, is expected to be fit for the Villa match at Upton Park despite hurting his shoulder in the 2-1 victory over champions Manchester City on October 25.

Allardyce added: ‘Sakho is training today for the first time. He is going to train, but it will be light training. Winston Reid came off injured so we will wait and see how his injury is this morning. 

'We will wait and see and the final decision will be made tomorrow on who is available for selection.’
