Many expectant mothers are left shocked and surprised when told they are pregnant with twins.

But that is nothing compared to how miracle mum Carla Sohdi felt after giving birth to two sets of twins in less than a year.

The 33-year-old found out she was pregnant again just weeks after celebrating the birth of daughters Rose and Sonya.

But she was left completely astonished after finding out at her 12-week scan that she was giving birth to twins yet again.

The odds of that happening are a huge 50,000 to one.

Mrs Sohdi and her husband Jag welcomed sons Antonio and Zachary into the world just three days before their sisters turned one.

Speaking to The Sunday Mirror, the mum, from Windsor, Berkshire, admitted to being 'stunned' when she was told she was having another set of twins.

'We couldn't believe it. From fearing we'd never have a family to having four children in less than a year is more than I could have wished for.

I know it's going to be hard work, but they are all worth it.'

The couple had been attempting to start a family for four years without luck.

But after just one attempt at IVF they were successful and non-identical twins Rose and Sonya were born last July.

However, shortly afterwards, Mrs Sohdi  became pregnant naturally with her twin sons.

But even after being told she was giving birth to another set of twins, there was still another huge shock.

The due date of the twin boys was Rose and Sonya's first birthday.

In the end the boys were born three days before the due date - which is perhaps a blessing for the parents.

The proud couple now plan to move into a bigger home and buy a larger car.

Ladbrokes bookmaker said the odds of giving birth to two sets of twins in less than a year would be at least 50,000 to one.
