Neil Warnock and Steve Clarke are emerging as strong contenders to become next Crystal Palace manager.

The club are still without a boss following the shock departure of Tony Pulis two days before the start of the new season.

Malky Mackay was within hours of being handed the reins but Sportsmail's extraordinary revelations regarding his controversial texts saw the move collapse.

Tim Sherwood, the other leading contender, has pulled out of the running for job leaving Palace in a hole.

But Warnock and Clarke are now viewed as viable options by club officials - with moves for both have being explored.

It remains to be seen who is favoured by the Eagles board, who are keen to have a new boss in place by the weekend.

It would mark a return to the club for Warnock should he be handed the job, having left Selhurst Park for QPR in 2010 after three years with the Eagles.

Warnock has twice come close to returning to the club since his exit.

Palace considered handing the veteran manager the job during their successful promotion winning season in 2013 after Ian Holloway side's worrying loss of form towards the end of the season.

He was also a leading contender to replace Holloway after he was sacked last season.

Clarke, meanwhile, is looking for a route back into the game after his dismissal from West Bromwich last season.
