Memphis Depay has been urged to remain at PSV Eindhoven for at least another year, despite interest from Premier League clubs. 

The winger impressed at the World Cup - playing in four of Holland's games on the road to the semi-final - and Ruud Gullit says the 20-year-old ought to stay at the club to further enhance his development.

And the former Chelsea boss highlighted two recent Dutch graduates to have struggled after landing big moves early in their careers.

Warning shot: Ruud Gullit points at Nathan Ake and Karim Rekik as players who have failed to kick on 

'His peers, such as Karim Rekik or Nathan Ake, prove how it can go if you do not play at clubs like Chelsea and Manchester City', Gullit told the Algemeen Dagblad.

'You can fall behind in just two years. Depay has clearly come back with confidence from the World Cup. But I hope that he stays at PSV.' 

Depay is discussing a new contract with Philip Cocu's side, and Gullit added: 'When I think back to my early days, when I was as young as Depay, I learned from fellow players who had children.

'These were the men who put me on the horse and also knocked me down when needed. Who will do that now with Depay? All the players he looks up to as examples all play abroad.'
