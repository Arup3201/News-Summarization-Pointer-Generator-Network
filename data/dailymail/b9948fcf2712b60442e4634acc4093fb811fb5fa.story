A website that charges for ‘tips’ on how to milk the benefits system has boosted the number of Britons claiming Disability Living Allowance.

Those using the Benefits and Work site pay a £19 fee – with a ‘money back’ guarantee if advice does not work.

The website’s ‘seven top daily DLA tips’ include: ‘When claiming DLA, relying on common sense could mean missing out on hundreds, or even thousands, of pounds a year.

The Benefits and Work site makes a mockery of Iain Duncan Smith's attempts to cut the welfare bill

'You can’t claim it for help with grocery shopping – but you may be able to for window shopping. Sounds improbable? But it’s true.

‘For example, [say] you enjoy walking round the shops [and] if you can’t get out you get “stir crazy”.

‘[Another] example, cooking: you are entitled to DLA if, because of your disability or health, you are too tired or depressed to cook, unable to make decisions about what to cook or are too confused to cook different ingredients.’
