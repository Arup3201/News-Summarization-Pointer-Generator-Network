A group of gang members involved in a botched 'crash for cash' insurance scam which led to the death of an innocent motorist have been found guilty.

The deliberately-caused accident, 
arranged as part of a plan to commit insurance fraud, led to a  
collision in which 34-year-old Baljinder Kaur Gill was killed.

Prosecutors said that the Miss Gill's death was the first fatality from a 'crash for cash' scheme in Britain.

Fraudsters: Jacek Kowalczyk, left, and Andrzej Skowron, right, were both convicted of conspiracy commit fraud and death by dangerous driving at Reading Crown Court. Their staged crash inadvertently led to the death of 34-year-old Baljinder Kaur Gill

Miss
Gill was left stranded in the fast lane of a dual carriageway after she was 
caught up in the planned collision.

Her Ford Fiesta was then 
inadvertently struck by a white van, which was not part of the scam, as she  went to retrieve possessions from inside her vehicle.

Fraudsters Radoslaw Bielawski, Andrzej Skowron and Jacek Kowalczyk had hoped to con insurance 
companies by making bogus claims for personal injury and damage to their
 vehicles as a result the initial crash.

Silence: Radoslaw Bielawski, 24, refused to testify at the trial but after the crash he admitted to police that the collision had been staged. He was found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud and death by dangerous driving

But their plan tragically backfired and a jury found the trio guilty of causing 
Miss Gill’s death by dangerous driving and conspiracy to commit fraud.

Van driver Colin Lee, 34, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving but convicted 
of the lesser charge of death by careless driving.

An Audi A3 driven by 25-year-old 
Skowron swerved in front of a Volkswagen Passat containing 'co-conspirators', Reading Crown Court heard.

Miss Gill’s Ford Fiesta was damaged in the incident and stranded in the fast lane of the A40 Western Avenue, between the Swakeley roundabout and
 Denham, heading out of London.

Skowron claimed he had been drinking in London at the time and that if his mobile phone had been
 traced to the crash scene it would have been in his jacket, which had been taken by someone else.

Jacek Kowalczyk, 32, admitted that the Audi had swerved in front of the VW but that the group had not 
realised it was the car belonging to co-accused Radoslaw Bielawski.

Bielawski, 24, who was in the Volkswagen, refused to testify at the 
trial. He gave officers at the scene a false name but later admitted to police that the collision had been staged.

Another fraudster, Artur Okrutny, 23, was at a party his home in Norbury, London, 
when he said he received phone calls from Bielawski offering him £300 to tell police it was him who had been in the car.

Bielawski allegedly told Okrutny 
to say he was drunk and had been asleep in the back of the car at the 
time of the crash and Okrutny went along with it.

The latter said he agreed to the 
lie on the basis that it would be in a police statement but maintained 
that he knew nothing about a false insurance claim.

Lie: Artur Okrunty, 23, was not involved in the crash but pretended he was drunk and had been asleep in the back of the car at the time of the crash

Kowalczyk was convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud, death by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.

Bielawski and Skowron were found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud and death by dangerous driving, while OKrutny was convicted of perverting he course of justice.

Baljit Ubhey, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said that the location chosen for the scam posed an 'obvious risk'.

Guilty: Colin Lee, who was not part of the gang, was driving the van that hit Miss Gill's vehicle. He was found guilty of death by careless driving

He warned that 'crash for cash' incidents currently cost the motor industry £1.7 million every day.

He said the gang would have only earned between £12 - 15,000 in compensation between them for the crash, plus damage costs for the vehicles.

Mr Ubhey said: 'Miss Gill
 lost her life on 11 June 2011, as a consequence of a 'crash for cash' 
insurance scam; a 
collision contrived by a ruthless gang of men, so that they could profit
 financially from the submission of fraudulent insurance claims.

'Her death was Britain's first fatality as a result of 'crash for cash'.

'An earlier report from the Insurance 
Fraud Bureau warned it was merely a matter of time before a death 
occurred on British roads - sadly prophetic words.'

Sgt Jim Upton, from the Three Mile 
Cross roads policing department, described Miss Gill's death as as a 'despicable act', adding that the gang's actions 
'were always likely to lead to death or serious injury'.

Sgt Upton added: 'They were purely motivated by greed and a determination to abuse the compensation culture that is prevalent in crash for cash.

'This is believed to be the first case
 of its kind within the United Kingdom and it has been a long, complex 
and protracted investigation. However, we were clear at an early stage 
that this was a very unusual fatal collision and we were determined to 
bring all those responsible to justice.'

The men have been bailed until February to be sentenced at Reading Crown Court.
