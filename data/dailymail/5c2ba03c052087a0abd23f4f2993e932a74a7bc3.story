The stripper who was exchanging Twitter messages with New Jersey Senate hopeful Cory Booker has tried to downplay their conversations after they were exposed on Wednesday.

Booker, the 44-year-old Newark mayor who is leading in the race to fill his state’s empty Senate seat, is an active Twitter user and regularly converses with constituents and random followers.

His social media habit raised some eyebrows this week after the website Buzzfeed disclosed that he direct messaged with Lynsie Lee, a stripper from Oregon.

Lee told The Associated Press that the interaction was 'G-rated flirting' that had been blown out of proportion. She called it a '1 out of 10' compared with some of the messages she receives.

'I flirted with him publically, as I do with a lot of people,' Lee said about Booker. 'There was nothing secret or sexy about it.' She said she and mayor never communicated outside Twitter.

Lee said she resents any implication that she deliberately leaked the conversation for fame or money.

Booker and Lee both had appeared in a documentary about using Twitter. In February, Lee wrote Booker to say the West Coast loved the Newark mayor. Booker wrote back to say the East Coast loves her, 'and by the East Coast, I mean me.'

'Well now I'm blushing,' Lee wrote back.

'It's only fair,' Booker responded.

The woman, who goes by the name 'Lynsie Lee' on Twitter, shared direct messages between her and Booker from February

Lee provided a screenshot of the exchange to BuzzFeed, which published a story Wednesday.

She said a jokey, catty feud among the girls in the documentary — all of whom, she said, had a crush on Booker — led her to post the image.

She also had fun with her newfound political notoriety.

'If you come to see me at @CasaDiablo tonight, bring your wallets. I'm prime meat for the next couple of days! ;)' she tweeted Thursday.

The playful exchange is typical of how Booker engages on Twitter, sending out cheeky answers to marriage proposals, responding to a man with a play on the lyrics to Jay-Z's '99 Problems,' retweeting people with risque usernames and regularly asking followers to send him direct messages.

Booker brushed off the exchanges with Lee on Thursday, reiterating that he communicates with 'thousands of people' on Twitter.

Booker said he doesn't care what people do for work and the 'puritanical judgment' of Lee was 'over the top.'

Unique: Johnny Diablo Zukle is the owner of the vegan strip club where Lee works

Rules: Though Lee is not a vegan herself, the strip club takes an ethical stance against animal abuse

Similar interests: Lee and Booker were featured in the same documentary about Twitter

Booker said he talks to everybody and has no plans to stop.

'You guys might have some prurient interest,' he said, 'but at the end of the day this is about extending kindness to folks.'

Lee works at a vegan strip club, making the story even more bizarre given the fact that Casa Diablo claims to be the first of its kind.

Booker is a vegetarian, though not vegan. Lee said she's also not vegan.

Playful: Lee said that her messages with Booker are far less spicy than other flirtations she has online

Self aware: She jokingly posted on Twitter that she will be 'prime meat' for the next couple days because of her new-found popularity

Booker Republican opponent, Steve Lonegan, called the tweets another distraction in a 'rather bizarre campaign of a cult personality,' complaining that the issues have taken a back seat to Booker's celebrity and use of social media.

Booker joked that the fascination had to do with more than a strip club.

'I really think it's because the press corps is obsessed with vegan living,' he said.
