A doctor desperately battled to save his wife and four children as they were killed in a suspected arson attack at their family home.

At the same time as the house blaze, a neighbour’s car was torched.

Police are investigating the theory that the five may have died at the hands of yobs who have attacked other cars on their estate.

Victims: From left Hira, 13, Sohaib, 11, their mother Sabah Usami, Rayan, six, and Muneeb, nine, all perished in the blaze. Three-year-old Maheen, on the far right, survived and is being treated in hospital

Couple: Doctor Abdul Shakoor survived with severe smoke inhalation while his wife Sabah Usmani died

Yesterday officers revealed how Abdul
Shakoor, 45, ‘fought hard’ to rescue his family after an intense fire 
engulfed their end-of-terrace house as they slept.

His wife Sabah Usmani, also a 
qualified doctor, their sons Sohaib, 11, and Rayyan, six, as well as 
12-year-old daughter Hira perished in the blaze early yesterday.

Dr Shakoor, his third son Muneeb, nine, and daughter Maheen, three, were taken to the hospital where he works as a registrar.

The two children were later transferred to a burns unit, where Muneeb died.

Maheen remains in a critical 
condition, while Dr Shakoor is being treated for severe smoke inhalation
and is ‘utterly distraught’.

Police have launched a ‘major crime 
investigation’ while they try to establish whether the fire was 
deliberately started, and by whom.

Tragedy: Four children died in the blaze, aged 13, 11, nine, and six. Fire damage can be seen at the back of the house, on the brickwork and the walls are black with smoke

Among various lines of inquiry is the
theory that the Shakoor family were singled out because of issues 
within the local Muslim community, in which they were reportedly very 
popular.

Officers stressed, however, that there is no evidence of any racial motivation.

Another theory is that the Shakoors 
were not deliberately targeted, and the fire was either intended for 
previous tenants or started by arsonists who had attacked other cars on 
the estate.

Neighbours reported seeing as many as
four people in the street beforehand, and said other vehicles had been 
previously targeted by arsonists in the area.

Firefighters were called to the Shakoors’ rented house in Harlow, Essex, shortly before 2am yesterday.

They found flames pouring from both 
front and back doors and temperatures inside in excess of 1,000 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Nearby a Ford Focus was also on fire.

Neighbours told of ‘horrible screams’
and a woman calling for help from inside. Dr Shakoor had jumped from 
the house to raise the alarm, then desperately tried to fight the flames
to get back inside to rescue his family.

Blaze: Fire damage can be clearly seen at the upstairs window and smoke has stained the brickwork of the end-of-terraced property. It is not known how the fire started yet but it's being treated as suspicious

Assistant Chief Constable Gary 
Beautridge, of Essex Police said: ‘In the history of Essex Police, 
seldom has there been an incident of this gravity, in which five people,
four of them children, have lost their lives.’

Ruling out any suggestion that Dr 
Shakoor was involved, he continued: ‘I would like to stress that the 
father of these children was in the property at the time and fought hard
to save his family in appalling conditions.

‘He, as you would expect, is in 
severe shock. Our work with Dr Shakoor to establish some of the facts of
this case will, inevitably, take time because of the emotional trauma 
he has suffered at the loss of his family.’

But he indicated that the answers to 
the mystery lay in the local community of Harlow, and appealed to anyone
with information to come forward.

Chief fire officer David Johnson said
the blaze, which started downstairs while the family was asleep 
upstairs, had developed rapidly suggesting some kind of fuel and 
accelerant may have been used.

The family are originally from 
Karachi, Pakistan, but had moved to the UK in 2009, first settling in 
Winchester and then moving to Harlow just over a year ago.

Both parents were doctors but while 
Dr Shakoor worked at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow as an 
endocrinolgist and diabetes registrar, Dr Usmani cared for their 
children.

Staff at the hospital were deeply shocked at the family’s ‘devastating loss’.

Clinical director Dr Yvonne Barlow described the doctor as the ‘kindest, gentlest person I have ever met’.

She added: ‘He is universally respected and is an extremely popular member of staff.’

Dr Shakoor’s cousin, Abdul Ishaqani, speaking from Karachi, said he did not believe the family had any enemies.

Mr Ishaqani said: ‘They are a very 
happy, loving family. They still have a home in Karachi and visit 
regularly, but they were settled in Harlow and the children were doing 
very well at school.

'The last time I saw my cousin was three months ago when he came back to Pakistan.

'His mother had been staying in the UK with them for six months and he brought her home.

‘We were told about the fire but we’re still trying to find out what happened.’

Local couple Parvez Hamid, 43, and wife Safia Anwar, 38, were good friends with the Shakoors.

Investigation: Fire investigation officers arrive at the scene in Harlow to piece together how the fire started

Officials: The fire investigation officers wear red overalls as they begin their work. One neighbour said she heard 'horrible screaming' from the house and the sound of a woman screaming 'help'

He said: ‘The family were amazing. 
They had only been living here for a while but in that time our two 
families became very close.

‘Our kids used to play together and I always used to say how well behaved and polite they were. They were the model family.

‘Abdul is a doctor and very academic.
I’ve heard he jumped from a top storey to raise the alarm which sounds 
like him as he is that sort of person. He was very heroic.

‘He and his wife adored their 
children and would do anything for them. My wife has been in tears all 
morning as she was best friends with her. The family are in our prayers 
and we just hope Maheen pulls through.’

Neighbours said all the boys loved 
cricket and attended nearby Abbotsweld primary school, while Rayyan 
would often be seen riding his bicycle near his home.

Family friend Jackie Lee said Dr 
Usmani was a ‘lovely person’, adding: ‘Her eldest son and mine were 
friends and were playing together yesterday. It is so sad. They were a 
lovely family. Always smiling.’

A spokesman for Harlow Islamic Centre
said they were working closely with police. They added: ‘Dr Shakoor and
his family were very much liked and respected in the local community.

‘This loss of life will be felt throughout Harlow and the UK.’
