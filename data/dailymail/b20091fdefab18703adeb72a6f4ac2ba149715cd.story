Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has joined Roma, after the Serie A side triggered a clause in his loan deal and agreed a fee estimated to be £5million with Newcastle United.

The club announced on their website that the France defender has departed the Premier League side, who signed from Montpellier in January 2013. 

Yanga-Mbiwa, 25, played 46 times for Newcastle but failed to establish himself at St James' Park before heading out on loan in the summer to Roma.

A statement on Newcastle's website read: 'Newcastle United defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has completed a transfer to AS Roma after meeting a contractual condition contained in the loan agreement between the clubs.

'The French defender joined Roma on a loan deal in September 2014 but it has now become a permanent move.'

The 25-year-old has thus far impressed in Italy, featuring 20 times and helping Roma to second in Serie A, just seven points off leaders Juventus.
