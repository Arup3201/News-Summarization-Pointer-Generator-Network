This little Chinese boy must go outside the lines when he tries painting by numbers, if his handiwork on this £150,000 Porsche is anything to go by.

The two-year-old toddler had got his hands on brush and paint while his parents were working nearby in Nanjing, capital of eastern China's Jiangsu Province. 

A fierce argument ensued when the owner, a Mr Wu, returned to his luxury car and found its bumper and doors covered in green doodles.

A furious Mr. Wu, said he had bought the 1.45 million Yuan (£149,000) Porsche only a few days ago and had stepped away for a short period of time. 

Mr Wu says: 'I dashed over to check, and found the kid had painted the whole vehicle into a mess.'

After consulting with a local repair shop, Wu says he was told it will cost around 80,000 Yuan (£8,225) to repaint the Porsche, something his insurance is refusing to pay for.

Mr Wu says he is now in negotiations with the child's parents in order to 'fix the problem'.
