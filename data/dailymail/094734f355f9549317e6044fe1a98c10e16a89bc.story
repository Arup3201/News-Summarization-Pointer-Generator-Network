A woman was told she was 'too fat to tan' at a tanning salon.

Kelly McGrevey said she purchased a tanning package at Aloha Tanning in Norton, Ohio on Monday after a quick tour of the facility.

When she returned to tan on Tuesday, Ms McGrevey says the man working at Aloha at the time turned her away.

Not welcome: The tanning salon that refused to say 'Aloha' to Kelly McGrevey and then refused to give her a $70 refund

He said, 'Sorry, but I'm not going to let you tan today because we've just implemented a new policy where anyone over 230 pounds can't go in one of our beds. I was just so shocked and embarrassed and humiliated,' she told WKYC news.

The previous day she had been tanning in a standup bed but the following day was informed that it was broken and that traditional beds were off-limits to heavy customers.

Policy: An employee at the Aloha tanning salon said there was a 230-pound weight limit on acrylic beds.

Ms McGrevey then asked for a refund of her $70 month-long tanning package but the salon refused saying they did not give refunds.

It was at this point Ms McGrevey called the police and filed a report against the owner of Aloha Tanning, Justin Hileman.

Concerns: The tanning salon was worried that Ms McGrevey's weight could crack the acrylic tubes and plastic on which people lay down

Happier: Ms McGrevey is pleased that more people are getting to hear her story. She says she was discriminated against because of her size and has filed a police repot

She demanded to see the salon's policy on tanning and weight but the owner refused.

A worker at the salon called Nicole said although the policy wasn't written down there was indeed a 230-pound weight limit on acrylic beds that is normally discussed with customers.

'We do have a lot of bigger people that came in here and they know that they can't go into the laydown beds because they are so, you know, they are bigger,' she said.

Fat policy: Nicole (pictured) from the salon says they do have a policy for people weighing more than 230 pounds which is told to people before they pay

Ms McGrevey has been told that she will not receive a refund and has been advised instead to dispute the charge with her credit card company.

'I'm humiliated. I'm embarrassed. I don't want to face this guy for 30 days. I just want my money back,' she said.
