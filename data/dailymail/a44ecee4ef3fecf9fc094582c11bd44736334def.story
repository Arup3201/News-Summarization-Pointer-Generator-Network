A determined Boston Marathon bombing survivor, who made the brave decision to have her left foot amputated, has taken the first tentative steps in her beloved high heels with a new prosthetic leg.

Heather Abbott, 39, decided to have her foot amputated after two surgeries and advice from doctors that keeping it may lead to a life blighted by chronic pain.

Ms Abbott walked in a pair of four-inch nude stilettos last week, five months on from the devastating attack on April 15.

Standing strong: Heather Abbott, who survived the Boston Marathon bombing in April, but had her left foot amputated is now back in high heels thanks to a prosthetic limb

Ms Abbott told WCVB: 'I'd like to get back to wearing the things I used to wear.'

She joked that she might need to leave the town where she lives because there are so many cobbled streets which are typically difficult to negotiate in towering heels.

The bombing survivor currently has a prosthetic leg which she says is a little on the bulky side.

She has also used a waterproof prosthetic to allow her to do one of her favorite activities of paddle-boarding.

However thanks to Next Step Prosthetics in Manchester, New Hampshire, Ms Abbott is being fitted for a new limb with a silicon cover which will look much more like her other leg. The artificial limb costs in the region of $20,000 and will take around a month to complete.

In one of many harrowing decisions made in the wake of the attack, Ms Abbott made the choice to have her foot amputated.

She said that her doctor 'gave me the rundown, as did several other doctors, on the choice I had, and basically it was whether to keep my leg, the rest, my foot actually is where the injury occurred, or to amputate sort of below the knee'. 

She added: 'And it certainly was a 
difficult decision, but when I weighed the pros and cons, I think this 
was the best option for me.

Boston strong: Heather Abbott is one of several victims who has bravely spoken out following the bombing. She was given the honor of throwing the first pitch at Fenway (right)

'It would likely be shorter, one of my legs would likely be shorter than the other, and I wouldn't be able to live the lifestyle that I did prior to the injury.'

On the day of the bombings, Ms Abbott and half a dozen friends took in the traditional Patriots' Day Red Sox game at Fenway Park.

They left early and headed to Forum, a bar close to the blast site.

Ms Abbott was at the back of the long line, waiting as bouncers checked IDs, when the first blast went off. Unlike many, she knew exactly what it was.

'I felt like I was watching the footage on 9/11,' said Abbott, who works in human resources for Raytheon Company in Portsmouth, Rhode Island.
