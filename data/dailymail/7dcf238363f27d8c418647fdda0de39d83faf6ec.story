The weather in Portugal certainly looked warm, so Daniel Sturridge thought he would 'chill by the pool.

Liverpool star Sturridge tweeted a picture, saying he was 'chilling' as England continue their preparations for the World Cup.

The 24-year-old is considered a key part of England's plans for the tournament and he is in pole position to be leading the line come the opening game.

The former Chelsea man was an integral part of Liverpool's title challenge this season and he finished the season with 21 league goals.

Sturridge's apparel shows him in Nike trainers and socks with the forward describing them as 'next level comfort.'

Maybe he felt the need to chill after the England players were wrapped up during training this week to recreate the sweltering heat of Manaus.

Sturridge has been hitting social media hard this week, posting selfies with his team-mates on the plane.

England open their World Cup campaign against Italy on 14 June in Manaus.
