The cuttlefish can change the colour and pattern of its skin to stay hidden from predators.

And now U.S. scientists are looking to the fish’s camouflage mechanisms in order to develop futuristic uniforms for soldiers, which could help them to blend in with their surroundings in realtime.

They have discovered new details about neural organs called chromatophores, which enable the ‘chameleon of the sea’ to virtually disappear.

Cuttlefish skin is unique for its dynamic patterning and speed of change.

The cephalopod has neurally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues.

To regulate its colour, the cuttlefish relies on a vertically arranged assembly of three optical components: the leucophore, which is a near-perfect light scatterer that reflects it uniformly over the entire visible spectrum, the iridophore, which is a reflector containing a stack of thin films and the chromatophore.

This layering enables the skin of the animal to selectively absorb or reflect light of different colours.

Chromatophores contain luminescent protein nanostructures that enable the cuttlefish to make quick and elaborate changes in its skin pigmentation.

When the cuttlefish switches on its coloration system, each chromatophore expands. The surface area can change as much as 500 per cent.

Scientists at Harvard University and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) believe their findings could also lead to new types of paint, cosmetics and consumer electronics – as well as smart uniforms for soldiers that can react to surroundings in realtime.

‘Nature solved the riddle of adaptive camouflage a long time ago,' Kevin Parker, Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) told the Harvard Gazette.

‘Now, the challenge is to reverse-engineer this system in a cost-efficient, synthetic system that is amenable to mass manufacturing.’

The cuttlefish has neurally controlled pigmented organs called chromatophores which allow it to change its appearance in response to visual cues, but scientists have had an incomplete understanding of the biological, chemical and optical functions that make this adaptive coloration possible.

To regulate its colour, the cuttlefish relies on a vertically arranged assembly of three optical components: the leucophore, which is a near-perfect light scatterer that reflects it uniformly over the entire visible spectrum, the iridophore, which is a reflector containing a stack of thin films and the chromatophore.

This layering enables the skin of the animal to selectively absorb or reflect light of different colours, co-author Leila Deravi, a Research Associate in bioengineering at SEAS explained.

‘Chromatophores were previously considered to be pigmentary organs that acted simply as selective colour filters,’ she said.

‘But our results suggest that they play a more complex role - they contain luminescent protein nanostructures that enable the cuttlefish to make quick and elaborate changes in its skin pigmentation.’

When the cuttlefish switches on its coloration system, each chromatophore expands. The surface area can change as much as 500 per cent, the scientists explained in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

The team of researchers showed that within the chromatophore, tethered pigment granules regulate light through absorbance, reflection, and fluorescence - in effect functioning as tiny light-sensitive elements, even as the chromatophore changes in size.

‘The cuttlefish uses an ingenious approach to materials composition and structure - one that we have never employed in our engineered displays,’ said co-author Evelyn Hu, Tarr-Coyne Professor of Applied Physics and of Electrical Engineering at SEAS.

‘It is extremely challenging for us to replicate the mechanisms that the cuttlefish uses.

‘For example, we cannot yet engineer materials that have the elasticity to expand 500 times in surface area and were we able to do that, the richness of colour of the expanded and unexpanded material would be dramatically different.

She explained: ‘The cuttlefish may have found a way to compensate for this change in richness of colour by being an "active" light emitter not simply modulating light through passive reflection.’

Scientists from the MBL have examined adaptive colouration in the cuttlefish and other invertebrates for many years.

MBL's Roger Hanlon said: ‘Cuttlefish skin is unique for its dynamic patterning and speed of change.'

‘Deciphering the relative roles of pigments and reflectors in soft, flexible skin is a key step to translating the principles of actuation to materials science and engineering.

‘This collaborative project expanded our breadth of inquiry and uncovered several useful surprises, such as the tether system that connects the individual pigment granules.’

Professor Parker is an army reservist who completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan, so using the cuttlefish to find a biologically inspired design for new types of military camouflage carries special meaning for him as poor camouflage patterns can cost lives on the battlefield.

‘Throughout history, people have dreamed of having an invisible suit,’ he said.

‘Nature solved that problem and now it’s up to us to replicate this genius, so, like the cuttlefish, we can avoid our predators.’
