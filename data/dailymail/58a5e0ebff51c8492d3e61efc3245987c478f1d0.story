The mother of a 16-year-old boy has described the heartbreaking moment she held her son in her arms as he died following an ecstasy overdose.

Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, 46, said her son Daniel's death was 'so peaceful', adding that her family had been able to say goodbye to the aspiring soldier, rather than him being killed in an explosion in Afghanistan.

The teenager fell ill after taking ecstasy at a rave 
in Hayes, west London, in the early hours of Saturday and, despite 
hospital treatment, died on Monday in the arms of his mother.

'He could have gone to Afghanistan and been blown to smithereens, but I got to hold him while he died,' said Mrs Spargo-Mabbs.

'It was so peaceful and we all got to say goodbye and we were all with him.'

The mother-of-two said that before Daniel's death her family had seen the negative effects of drugs through a relative who had battled addiction, and warned other parents not to be naive about their children taking illegal substances.

'We have seen at first hand the effect of addiction and the knock-on effect on the wider family, and he knew what that looked like,' she said.

'We told him just don’t even do it once. You just don’t know if that’s going to be you. But Daniel would have known people that would have done it and said it was amazing.

'However good they are and however 
much you think you know what they might be aware of, if you’ve got a 
teenager they will know people who have taken drugs. And it’s 
frighteningly cheap, it’s pocket money.'

She has been told that Daniel spent £20 on the drug, which was soluble in water.

Daniel's
 parents have left his bed unmade in his bedroom at their home in 
Croydon, south London, which has a collage of photographs stuck to the 
walls and a Prom King certificate from last summer.

His father Tim opens and closes the curtains each day.

He said: 'He is never coming back. Nobody is ever going to sleep in that bed again, he will never enter this house again.

'What used to be a lively vibrant room is now still and empty and quiet. It’s just awful.'

The couple, who also have an 18-year-old son, Jacob, said they have had messages of support from all over the world including Australia, Cambodia, India and the United States, and hope to raise awareness of the dangers of drug-taking.

Fantastic boy: Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said her son was a 'good kid with a sense of adventure'

Adult education manager Mrs 
Spargo-Mabbs said: 'I always thought Dan could change the world. He was 
an amazing boy and I always thought he was going to do amazing things.

'If
 something good can come from this awful thing and if something amazing 
can come from this awful thing then that would be Dan, he would be so 
behind us doing this.'

Keen guitar player Daniel was passionate about political issues and often asked his mother her opinions.

Mrs
 Spargo-Mabbs said: 'He was a good kid and he had never done this 
before. He was a good kid with a sense of adventure and he would have 
thought that this was going to be an amazing experience. He didn’t think
 it would be him.

'If it can happen to him, it can happen to any good kid across the land'

'If it can happen to him, it can happen to any good kid across the land.

'He was just such a fantastic boy and he was such an active part of our lives and we just feel so incredibly blessed to have had him in our lives for getting on for 17 years. He really was special. We had him all that time and we might not have had him at all.'

He was also keen to help his parents in the house and had taken up photography with his father.

Mr Spargo-Mabbs, who works with people with learning disabilities, treasures a memory of the two of them walking in Cumbria, when he took a photo of Daniel being soaked by a sheepdog.

His wife made a point of hugging and kissing her sons each time they left the house, after she heard the mother of murdered Jimmy Mizen mention the comfort she got from their final goodbye.

Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said: 'He knew that I loved him and I know that he loved me. Every time he texted me, he always put two little kisses at the end.

'I feel so thankful to Margaret Mizen for giving that to me after her awful tragedy.'

Two men have been charged with being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs following Daniel’s death.

Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, both south London, appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court yesterday and are next due at Isleworth Crown Court on February 5.
