Accused: PC Katie Murray, 29, allegedly used the police database to obtain sensitive information on Cregan while he still on the run

A policewoman leaked confidential details about the police manhunt for one-eyed mass killer Dale Cregan to her family and a former lover while he was still on the run, a court heard today.

PC Katie Murray, 29, allegedly used the police database to obtain sensitive information on the quadruple murderer and then used texts and the 'WhatApp' messaging service to pass it on to older sibling Lindsey.

The jury heard she had been in a relationship with cannabis dealer Jason Lloyd, 43, and also sent confidential information to him - even though she knew he was in contact with Cregan's family.

Cregan, 30, was found guilty of four counts of murder last June - including that of gang rivals David Short, 42, and his son Mark, 23 and two unarmed police officers during 42 days on the run.

When WPCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were shot dead by Cregan in an ambush, Murray sent sister Lindsey Murray, 33, a picture and the name of one of the dead officers three hours before she was formally identified, the jury was told.

In a WhatsApp message between the pair, Lindsey Murray said: 'Oh my God, I can't believe this s***, you better come here after work and fill me in' and Katie replied: 'I don't really know anything. He he'.

The officer, who has been with Greater Manchester Police since 2004, later filmed Cregan arriving at Newton Heath police station for interview and could be heard repeating 'Oh my God, oh my God'.

Her hospital worker sister was said to have passed on confidential information given to her to friends.

Eight days after Cregan carried out the second of his four murders, she allegedly told a friend: 'Talking to Kate last night, I know the full story about Cregan x'.

'Keep it to yourself though. They (police) are all targets our Kate said,' she added.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Katie and Lindsey Murray, both of Droylsden, deny a charge of a misconduct in a public office. The police officer also denies a data protection offence.

The jury was told the WPC had once been in a relationship with cannabis dealer Jason Lloyd, 43, and she also used the force database to get confidential information to him about police investigations into his criminality over a 20 month period. 

She was said said to have provided him with details of investigations into his criminal associates.

Nick Clarke QC prosecuting said: 'In addition to providing information to Jason Lloyd. Katie Murray has also misused police systems to gain and provide information to friends and family members without any lawful policing purposes.

'Lindsey has requested Katie to check police systems and provide information to her regarding other individuals and incidents known to her. There was no proper policing purpose for such inquiries and no legitimate basis for the dissemination of the information.'

Alleged leaks by Katie Murray included details of the investigations into the murders by Cregan of Mark Short, 28, who was shot dead at The Cotton Tree Pub in Ashton-under-Lyne on May 25 2012 and father David Short, 46, who was killed in a gun and grenade attack at his home on August 10 2012.

Mr Clarke added: 'PC Murray had no role in investigating the shootings. Nevertheless she took a particular and persistent interest in the police log in relation to that incident and in the same period she was in regular contact with Jason Lloyd.'

When Cregan and another suspect were initially arrested and questioned and bailed on their return from Thaliand on June 12 2012, Katie reviewed the arrests and looked at their custody records before making contact with Lloyd.

On the day of David Short's murder, Katie checked the incident log on several occasions before being in contact with Lloyd nine times at around the same time - even while the police screens were open in front of her, said the QC.

He added: 'Lindsey is also very interested in the information that can be obtained from Katie. Examination of call data, text and 'What App' messages between Katie, Lindsey and associates has established that Katie divulged to her sister information regarding the murder investigations including the hunt for Dale Cregan and his associates, their arrest and custody process.

'Lindsey was aware that Jason Lloyd was in contact with the Cregan family.'

Murders: The killing of PC Nicola Hughes, left, and PC Fiona Bone, right, in an ambush my Dale Cregan shocked Britain - and before they were identified Katie Murray allegedly shared a photo and name of one of them

Mr Clarke said when the two policewomen were killed on September 18 2012, Katie was not assigned to the investigation team - yet sent a picture of WPC Nicola at 12.53pm. 

Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy did not formally name the officer until 3.53pm during a news conference.

The prosecutor said: 'Not only did she constantly monitor the incident logs and activity as shown on the police computers, she was also contacting her sister then almost immediately afterwards Lloyd.

The court heard Katie also shared information about another possible murder not related to Cregan and checked up on her boyfriend's ex-lover.

She is alleged to have tipped Lloyd off on proposed police raids of his cannabis factory based in a disused mill in Stockport which had been fitted with fake walls to make crops almost impossible to find.

The link between Murray and Lloyd, also of Droylsden, was only discovered when police seized his mobile phone following the Cregan murders and texts on his mobile phone was examined.

When police raised Katie's home, they found an envelope of letters written to her from Lloyd which she kept in the drawer of her bedside cabinet.

Lloyd, from Droyslden denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and separate offences of possessing a prohibited firearm, possessing ammunition without a certificate and possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life. The trial continues.
