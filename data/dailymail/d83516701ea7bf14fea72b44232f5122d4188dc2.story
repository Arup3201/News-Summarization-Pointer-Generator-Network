St Helens captain Paul Wellens will technically play his final match for his home-town club in Saturday's Grand Final but he is far from ready to hang up his boots.

The 34-year-old full-back's contract is up at the end of the season and, remarkably, he has yet to open talks over a new deal.

The decision of head coach Nathan Brown to cut short his stay at Langtree Park and return to Australia after Saturday's game adds to the uncertainty but Wellens remains laid back, confident that he will be starting his 18th season with Saints in February.

'I'm kind of in a different situation to most players,' Wellens said. 'You'd expect it to be done and dusted but I've got a relaxed relationship with the chairman.

'I've spoken to him about it and said we'll just get this season done and sit down and talk. I've made it clear that I'd like to go around for another year and I think the chairman is thinking along the same lines.

'Because I've got that relaxed relationship and I trust him and (chief executive) Mike (Rush) and the people within the club, I'm afforded that luxury of being relaxed about it.'

Brown's departure has raised the tantalising prospect of Wellens pairing up with his old St Helens team-mate Keiron Cunningham to form a 'dream coaching team'.

Cunningham, who has been Brown's right-hand man for the last two years after 'holding the fort' with Rush for most of the 2012 season, looks sure to remain involved, either as the club's new head coach or as assistant to the new man, but Wellens insists the move into coaching right now would be too soon for him.

'You never know, maybe in the future some time,' said Wellens, who was brought onto the England backroom staff for the 2013 World Cup.

'I've made no secret of the fact I'd like to get into coaching, it's something that really appeals to me.

'But what happens with the coaching is out of my hands. I trust in the people at the club to make the right appointments.'
