Hundreds of 'lethal' fake Frozen toys and clothes have been seized and destroyed after concerns they could burst into flames and strangle children.

The dodgy Disney items, including counterfeit dolls, umbrellas, watches, backpacks and blankets, were seized at a toy shop last week.

Shockingly, fancy dress costumes and pyjamas do not conform to 'flammability' standards and are likely to catch fire.

The haul comes just weeks ago Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman's eight-year-old daughter  suffered serious burns following a horrific Halloween accident.

Some of the fake Frozen goods seized by Nottinghamshire County Council's Trading Standards team which include children's pyjamas, dolls, fancy-dress costumes, umbrellas,  watches, backpacks and blankets

Matilda Thykier's witch costume was set alight by a candle on the doorstep of a house while she was out trick or treating on Friday 31. She was taken to hospital for treatment of severe burns and Zoe Ball stepped in to host Strictly Come Dancing for several weeks after the incident as Ms Winkleman refused to leave her daughter's side.

Meanwhile hooded tops were found to have lethal cords which were deemed a strangulation risk.

Trading Standards officers from Nottinghamshire County Council seized the fake merchandise from a toy shop in Newark, Notts., during a raid last Tuesday (25/11).

Councillor Alice Grice, vice-chair of the council's community safety committee, said: 'Official Frozen merchandise is amongst this year's 'must-have' Christmas presents for children - but unfortunately, counterfeiters who want to cash-in on the craze are all too aware.

'With the high demand for official merchandise, many parents are struggling to find items for sale and may be tempted to buy counterfeit versions.

 'However, by doing so parents might be unwittingly putting their child in serious danger.

'Many cheap toys and goods from outside the European Union are often badly-made and in many cases, dangerous.

'We would advise parents to be especially wary when buying items like this from individuals or non-reputable companies on online auction or social media sites.'

It is suspected that a number of the items do not conform to EU safety regulations, including pyjamas and fancy-dress costumes that are unlikely to meet flammability guidelines 

The Trading Standards team had received a tip-off from a concerned member of the public about the counterfeit haul at a Newark toy shop

The seizure follows warnings by parents last week about counterfeit 'snap' bracelets which were made out of measuring tape and sheets of metal and had fake Frozen branding on.

Sales of Frozen toys are set to hit an all-time high, outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released.  

The storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter.

The film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion, while the song ‘Let it Go’ won an Oscar and became a social media phenomenon.

The demand for Frozen merchandise is high. With the interactive Frozen Snow Glow Elsa who sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99, tipped to be the most in demand toy this Christmas, stores such as Tesco, Toys r Us and Argos, are struggling to keep up.

Some list the item as unavailable while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves.

The demand for Frozen merchandise saw another haul of fake toys  seized by trading standards officers last week. 

The haul of 1,960 knock off toys were seized at the Port of Dover in Kent - including 426 Frozen character dolls from the blockbuster Disney film,was the biggest ever seized.
