Labour's flagship energy freeze policy was plunged into chaos last night as power companies finally started cutting their bills.

In a major U-turn, the party was forced to issue a ‘clarification’ that the plan would be converted to a ‘cap’ if energy prices continue to fall.

A senior source also warned that the idea – launched in a blaze of publicity by Ed Miliband in 2013 –may have to be ‘re-branded’ to make it clear that bills will not be frozen at a high level if tariffs are dropping. The source said: ‘The freeze was announced at a time when energy prices were rising inexorably – nobody was talking about prices coming down, or even thinking about it. Obviously, if bills are coming down at the election there may have to be a bit of rebranding to make it clear it will operate as a price cap instead.’

The move came after energy giant E.On yesterday became the first company to slash bills, announcing a modest 3.5 per cent fall in gas tariffs in response to a 30 per cent fall in wholesale prices.

Chief executive Tony Cocker said the move was a ‘risk’ with Labour’s price freeze hovering in the background, amid enormous pressure for utility firms to cut bills in line with falling wholesale costs of oil and gas.

Business and energy minister Matt Hancock last night said Labour’s shift of policy exposed the ‘nonsensical’ idea of trying to fix commodity markets. ‘Labour are in chaos and they must tell the public whether they want to freeze energy bills at higher rates or not,’ he said. ‘It underlines the massive threat posed by Labour and how they cannot be trusted with the nation’s finances.’

Mr Miliband, announcing his policy at Labour’s 2013 conference, said he would ‘freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017’.

The idea was promoted with an image of an energy bill frozen in a block of ice – and it still features prominently on the party’s website. A Tory source last night likened the policy to a ‘melting ice cap’. However a Labour spokesman denied there had been a U-turn, saying: ‘It has always been a cap, which would stop energy companies putting up prices, but not stop them cutting them.’

The party will today highlight figures showing the average household’s energy bill is now £260 a year higher than in 2010 – with the poorest families hit the hardest. But Labour was unable to produce any documentation referring to its policy as a cap. Labour will force a Commons vote on the issue today.

Mr Miliband’s price freeze has been blamed for keeping energy prices artificially high in recent months, as firms stockpile supplies at high prices. John Fingleton, former chairman of the Office of Fair Trading, warned that in any freeze ‘lower wholesale prices might not get passed on’.

A senior source at one of Britain’s ‘Big Six’ energy firms said it would have cut bills already if it had not been for Mr Miliband’s pledge.

‘We already take a risk setting prices over one year,’ said the source. ‘When it’s nearly two years, you double the risk, especially with the increasing costs of distribution and of government social and environmental policies.’

Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, warned this week that the policy acts as a ‘disincentive for them to cut prices’. He said energy firms were ‘gaming the system’ to avoid having their prices frozen at a level they could not sustain.
