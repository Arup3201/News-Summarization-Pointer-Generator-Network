Here's one way to give a drive-thru cashier the hump.

This is the hilarious moment a man took his camel through the Burger King drive through in Qatar.

Staff at the fast food chain in Doha, were stunned when stand-up comedian Hamad Al-Amari rode up to the service window on the back of a camel called Jim . . . and ordered a cheeseburger.

Don't forget the sheikh! Staff at the fast food chain in Doha, were stunned when stand up comedian Hamad Al Marri rode up to the service window on the back of a camel and ordered a cheeseburger

Camel king: At first bemused staff weren't sure what to make of Hamad when he rode up in full Arab dress aboard the even-toed ungulate

Hamad and Jim: Led into the drive-through by a similarly-dressed manservant called Jim, Hamad and his steed waited patiently in line until their turn came, singing to himself

At first they weren't sure what to make of Hamad when he arrived in full Arab dress aboard the even-toed ungulate.

Led into the drive-through by a similarly-dressed manservant, Hamad and his steed waited patiently in line until their turn came, singing to himself.

Then, with a straight face and without dismounting, Hamad leant forward and proceeded to order a cheeseburger.

'Can i have a cheeseburger please?' Then, with a straight face and without dismounting, Hamad leant forward and proceeded to order a cheeseburger

Funny side: Luckily staff saw the funny side of the stunt and, after a few giggles, processed Hamad's order as though he were a regular customer

Local police later arrived at Burger King but took no action against Hamad who asked them 'haven't you seen a man and his camel before?'

Funnyman: Hamad Al-Amari is a Qatar-based comedian. It is unclear whether he shared any of his cheeseburger with Jim the Camel

'Hello sir,' he says in English. 'I 
tried to get a drive through over there but i couldn't. Can I have a 
cheeseburger, please. Just the sandwich.'
