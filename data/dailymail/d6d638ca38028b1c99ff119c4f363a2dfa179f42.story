Three suburban Boston high school soccer players used a broomstick to rape one freshman and try to rape two others last week at a sports team-building retreat, a prosecutor said today.

The eldest suspect Galileo Mondol, 17, was held pending a hearing to determine whether he is a danger to the public.

Mondol and two 16-year-olds attacked the freshman and attempted to rape the others on August 25 in a cabin at Camp Lenox in Otis, a prosecutor said in court on Tuesday.

Violent: Mondol and two 16-year-olds attacked the freshman and attempted to rape the others on August 25 in a cabin at Camp Lenox in Otis, a prosecutor said on Tuesday

Mondol was not involved at first but joined in, Berkshire Assistant District Attorney Rachel Eramo said.

'I want to have a crack at that,' Mondol is reported to have said, according to Eramo.

The three defendants then tried to convince the accusers not to report the attack, she said.

Mondol pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated rape of a child, assault on a child with intent to commit rape, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and witness intimidation on Tuesday. His dangerousness hearing was scheduled for Friday.

The two 16-year-olds, whose names were not released because of their age, were to be arraigned in juvenile court on similar charges.

They were arrested last Friday and Mondol was held over the weekend on $100,000 bail.

A judge refused to lower bail on Tuesday even though Mondol’s lawyer 
said his client had nothing to do with the alleged assault.

'Even
the other defendants and the victims said my client had nothing to do 
with the incident in question,' William Korman said, adding that Mondol 
even tried to stop the attack. He called the bail amount outrageous.

Mondol’s
parents were in court but made no comment outside. Mondol was to start 
his junior year of high school on Tuesday, Korman said.

The
allegations have shaken the Boston suburb of Somerville, including 
Mayor Joe Curtatone, a volunteer football coach at the camp.

Somerville 
High was holding a team-building retreat at the camp for the soccer and 
football teams. The defendants and accusers all play soccer.

On August 25, Mondol and the two minors are alleged to have entered the cabin where the boys were sleeping and carried out the assault and attempted assaults.

Disturbing: Mondol is taken out of the police station following his arrest last week

‘We will plead not guilty Tuesday 
because my client is not guilty,’ attorney William Korman said at the 
time of his client Mondol's arrest.

‘He
has absolutely no criminal history. He has never been in trouble 
before. We steadfastly maintain his innocence. His parents support him 
100 per cent.’

A total of 
165 student athletes attended the camp, 62 boy football players, 61 boy 
soccer players and 42 girl soccer players, with eight coaches per team 
as supervisors.

The
school has taken athletes to the camp for the past 15 years, and makes 
them sign no-hazing pledges before taking part in the three-night trip, 
said Mayor Curtatone.

A retreat: Somerville High School has taken athletes on the three-day retreat for 15 years and this is the first known incident of its kind
