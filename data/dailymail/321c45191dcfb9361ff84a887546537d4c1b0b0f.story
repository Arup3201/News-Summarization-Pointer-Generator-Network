A police officer accused of plotting to kidnap, cook and eat women, including his own wife, has been convicted of conspiracy.

Valle bowed his head and looked 
teary-eyed when the verdict was announced on Tuesday before hugging his lawyer at Manhattan federal court.

Prosecutors said 'cannibal cop' Valle plotted with others he met on fetish websites 
to abduct, torture and eat women he knew.

Valle's mother, Elizabeth, shook her head as the verdict was rendered.

'I'm in shock and want to be left alone,' she said after her son was led away, adding: 'This is going to kill my mother.'

She also said that her son's estranged wife 'perjured herself', according to the New York Post.

Defense attorney Julia Gatto said outside court: 'It's a devastating verdict for us. We poured our hearts and souls into this.

'The jury was unable to get past the thoughts. Obviously, the case involved thoughts that were unusual and bizarre and frankly very ugly.'

She added that it was a 'dangerous prosecution when we start opening our minds and prosecuting what's in our brains and not what's in the real world'.

Valle's lawyers said he was just fantasizing and had no intention of harming anyone.

He also was found guilty of accessing a national crime database.

Valle will be kept in solitary confinement until he is sentenced on June 19.

New York City's accused 'cannibal cop' crossed the line from fantasy to reality in plotting to kidnap, cook and eat women, a federal prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments last Thursday.

Defense attorney Julia Gatto countered 
in summations that her client was playing a fantasy role online, and 
told jurors 'we don't convict human beings because of ugly thoughts ... 
even if they are police officers'.

In a case featuring grisly testimony, NYPD worker Gilberto Valle, 28, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiring to kidnap and a charge of improperly accessing a law enforcement database to gather personal information about potential targets.

The jury of six women and six men deliberated for several hours after closing arguments without reaching a verdict. They resumed deliberations on Friday morning at the District Court in Manhattan.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman 
said in her closing argument that Valle was at one point engaged in 
fantasy, but that his intentions had grown more sinister.

Pointing to his extensive online research on kidnapping, making chloroform and cooking women, she said: 'These are real searches conducted to carry out real research to kidnap real women.'

'This case is not about freedom of speech, or freedom of thought,' Waxman told jurors. Fetish websites 'are not on trial here. This is about Gilberto Valle's plans to hurt young women'.

But defense attorney Gatto compared Valle's online activity to Orson Welles' 'War of the Worlds' radio broadcast on October 30, 1938, which many Americans mistook for a real alien invasion.

Valle's role play 'was set up to sound as real as it could, sprinkled with real details,' she said.

When others come across it, Gatto said, 'panic ensues, because they think it's real ... but it's all make believe'.

Gatto told jurors that after nearly a year of fantasizing about roughly two dozen women - in many cases, discussing kidnapping with other fetishists - none of the plotters had ever met, exchanged money or committed any crimes.

Valle did not testify. The trial has brought to light a macabre community of cyberspace where millions of people discuss and exchange images and video of extraordinary brutality, much of it staged.

On Tuesday, defense attorneys took jurors on a video tour of DarkFetishNet.com, a website at the heart of Valle's case.

The website functions like mainstream social media networks and its creator, Russian Web entrepreneur Sergay Merenkov, likened it to Facebook in a videotaped deposition earlier in the week.

However, instead of family photos and cat videos, members share photos and videos of extreme cruelty - including rape and asphyxiation - with the goal of sexual stimulation.

Members dream up brutally violent scripts, said Merenkov, who has kicked members off the site when 'it seemed not to be fantasy anymore'.

Prosecutors said Valle revealed himself to be such a person when he began taking steps to act on his fantasies.
