When times are hard it's good to know where you can live a full life without hardship, or enjoy a holiday on the cheap.

Thanks to an assessment of American cities, it turns out that Omaha, Nebraska, is the best place to live if you want to scrimp on day to day items and still enjoy an active social life.

A top 10 of 'cheapskate' cities has been compiled by the magazine Kiplinger, based on a review of a basket of criteria.

Best for cheapskates: Omaha, Nebraska, came up top as the bets city for cheapskates to live in

Among them are the average cost of living, the number of libraries and museums in each city, and the frequency of free activities such as concerts, lectures and performances. The researchers also reviewed the number of Dollar General stores within a 10-mile radius of each city.

Omaha's cost of living is 12.3 per cent below the national average and the median household income is $56,346 - $3,584 over the national average.

The city has three times as many public libraries and museums than the average urban sprawl - 155 versus 56 - and it has an accessible 11 Dollar General stores.

Wealthy: Ogden, Utah, has the highest median household income of all the top 'cheapskate' cities in the shortlist

St Louis, in Missouri, is perhaps the most consistently affordable place to live, since last year it topped the same list, and this year it was ranked ninth.

It is the only U.S. city to feature on the magazine's top 10 cheapskate places to live for two consecutive years, although the publication pointing out that the criteria have varied.

Des Moines, Iowa's capital, was ranked third, with both grocery and health care expenses are about 6 per cent cheaper than average

Time Magazine did its own assessment of 2013's best cities for cheapskates and drew the following conclusions.

It noted that of all those in the list, none of them are positioned on the coast, the implication being that coastal cities are expensive to live in.

Columbus, Ohio, ranked fourth, where a gallon of milk will cost you 18.6% less in Columbus than it would in most of the country

Raleigh, North Carolina, has 100 libraries and museums, double the average, including this contemporary art museum designed by Brooks and Scarpa

This is perhaps unsurprising, Time Magazine says, since property prices are higher the closer they are to the coast.

It also noted that no big cities feature on the list; those that did had a population of around 100,000 to 500,000 people, with a few closer to 1million.

The magazine also pointed out that this correlates with recent data which revealed that big U.S. cities such as New York and Chicago also had the lowest uptake in coupon use.

Cincinnati, Ohio, was ranked sixth, where home values in Ohio's largest metro area stand 16 per cent below the national median, at $156,400

College towns and cities generally appeared to be more affordable for cheapskates, the magazine said. And Iowa, Utah and Ohio were the most more affordable states to live in, each with two cities in the shortlist.

Ogden, in Iowa was ranked the second best place for cheapskates to live where the median household income was more that $10,000 over the national average, and cost of living is 10 per cent below.

Salt Lake City, Utah, set among the mountains, was ranked seventh for cheapskates. Here, every year, cheapskates can test out paddleboards at the Outdoor Retailers Summer Market
