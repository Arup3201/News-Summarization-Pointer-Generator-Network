A gigantic line of powerful thunderstorms could affect one in five Americans as it rumbles from Iowa to Maryland packing hail, lightning and tree-toppling winds.

Meteorologists are warning that the continuous line of storms may even spawn an unusual weather event called a derecho, which is a massive storm of strong straight-line winds spanning at least 240 miles.

Wednesday's storms are also likely to generate tornadoes and cause power outages that will be followed by oppressive heat, said Bill Bunting, operations chief at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.

Batten down the hatches: The Mid-West is braced for a derecho - these long, flat clouds are often associated with thunderstorms

Widespread: Some 65 million people across 10 states could be affected by a derecho Wednesday, a storm where powerful winds stretch hundreds of miles, often causing widespread destruction

Not again? Forecasters are predicting the derecho to come from a giant wave of thunderstorms in the Mid-West. Last year, a derecho caused $1 billion in damages from Chicago to Washington

A derecho is a widespread, long-lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms. Last year's historic storm saw widespread destruction and meteorologists fear it could be happening again, possibly affecting 64 million people in 10 states.In 2012, a record-breaking derecho caused $1 billion in damage from Chicago to Washington.Over 4 million were without power after the June 29, 2012 storm across 11 states.To be classified as a derecho, the line of storms must travel at least 240 miles and include wind gusts of at least 58 mph.

2012's storm saw winds as great as 100 mph.

It can produce destruction similar to that of tornadoes, while the damage typically is directed in one direction. As a result, the term 'straight-line wind damage' is sometimes used to describe the phenomenon.

The risk of severe weather in Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, is roughly 45 times higher than on a normal June day, Bunting said.

Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Louisville, Kentucky, have a risk level 15 times more than normal.

All told, the area the weather service considers to be under heightened risk of dangerous weather includes 64 million people in 10 states.

'It's a pretty high threat,' Bunting said, who also warned that the storms will produce large hail and dangerous lightning. 'We don't want to scare people, but we want them to be aware.'

Wednesday 'might be the worst severe weather outbreak for this part of the country for the year,' said Jeff Masters, meteorology director at Weather Underground.

He said it is possible to have tornadoes and a derecho at the same time, but at any given place on Wednesday the straight-line winds are probably more likely.

Last year, a derecho caused at least 
$1 billion in damage from Chicago to Washington, killing 13 people and 
leaving more than four million people without power, according to the 
weather service.

Winds 
reached nearly 100mph in some places and in addition to the 13 people 
who died from downed trees, another 34 people died from the heat wave 
that followed in areas without power.

Derechoes,
 with winds of at least 58mph, occur about once a year in the Midwest. 
Rarer than tornadoes but with weaker winds, derechoes produce damage 
over a much wider area.

Wednesday's storm probably won't be as powerful as 2012's historic one, but it is expected to cause widespread problems

Wednesday's
 storm probably won't be as powerful as 2012's historic one, but it is 
expected to cause widespread problems, Bunting said.

The storms are the type that will move
 so fast that 'by the time you see the dark sky and distant thunder you 
may have only minutes to get to safe shelter,' Bunting said.

The
 storms will start late morning or early afternoon in eastern Iowa, hit 
Chicago by early afternoon and move east at about 40 mph, Bunting said.

If the storm remains intact after crossing the Appalachian Mountains, which would be rare for a derecho, it should hit the Washington area by late afternoon or early evening, he said.

For Washington, Philadelphia and parts of the Mid-Atlantic the big storm risk continues and even increases a bit Thursday, according to the weather service.
