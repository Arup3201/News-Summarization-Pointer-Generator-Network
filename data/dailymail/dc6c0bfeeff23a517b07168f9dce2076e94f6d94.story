It's the superhuman suit that will turn special operations commandos into real-life Iron Men.

The U.S. military is developing a new uniform for troops that will be bullet-proof, enhance the wearer's strength, heal wounds by temporarily stopping bleeding and display the soldier's vital signs.

A prototype of the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit, or TALOS - named after the mythological Greek automaton made of bronze that Zeus assigned to protect his lover Europa - is expected to hit the market next year.

Iron man: Army researchers are developing an advanced military uniform - the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit - to deliver 'superhuman strength with greater ballistic protection' to soldiers

The Army said the revolutionary armor will deliver 'superhuman strength with greater ballistic protection' by providing a 
powered exoskeleton to haul heavier equipment, built-in computers and the ability to apply wound-sealing foam.

The capabilities would make the already elite Special 
Operation Forces nearly invincible in the field.

'[The] requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armor suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armor, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that — a whole bunch of stuff that RDECOM is playing heavily in,' Lt. Col. Karl Borjes, a U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) science adviser, said in a statement.

MIT engineers are working on a liquid body armor that 'transforms from liquid to solid in milliseconds when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied'.

The U.S. Special Operations Command is teaming up with industry, universities and laboratories to see if such a suit can be created for the real world of combat.

'I’m very committed to this,' U.S. Special Operations Command chief Adm. William McRaven to a group of industry representatives at a TALOS presentation in July, according to wired.com.

'I’d like that last operator that we lost to be the last operator we lose in this fight or the fight of the future, and I think we can get there.'

The high number of extremely technical and integrated challenges means the Army will draw on a broad range of collaborators from backgrounds that may have never worked together.

'USSOCOM is interested in receiving white papers from a wide variety of sources, not just traditional military industry but also from academia, entrepreneurs, and laboratories capable of providing the design, construction, and testing of TALOS related technologies,' said Jim Geurts, USOCOM acquisition executive, in a statement.

'The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative TALOS capabilities to the SOF operator.'

However, not everyone is enamored with the idea of super-advanced body suits for soldiers.

'My sense is it is an up-armored Pinocchio,' Scott Neil, a retired special forces master sergeant and Silver Star recipient, told the Tampa Tribune.

'Now the commander can shove a monkey in a suit and ask us to survive a machine gun, IED [improvised explosive device] and poor intelligence all on the same objective.

'And when you die in it, as it melds to your body, you can bury them in it.'

Others have criticized the absence of a power source in the sci-fi suit.

'The acronym TALOS was chosen deliberately,' MIT professor Gareth McKinley told NPR.

'It's the name of the bronze armored giant from 'Jason and the Argonauts.' Like all good superheroes, Talos has one weakness. For the Army's TALOS, the weak spot is either the need to carry around a heavy pump for a hydraulic system, or lots of heavy batteries. We don't have Iron Man's power source yet.'

The Army hopes to have a prototype ready next year, with various components of the suit currently in development, according to NBC News.

However an advanced model won't be developed until at least 2016.
