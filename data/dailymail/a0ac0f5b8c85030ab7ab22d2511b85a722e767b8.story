One is a toddler who desperately needed an operation to walk, the other an aspiring topless model who wanted a ‘boob job’ to look more like Jordan.

And there are no prizes for guessing which case the NHS deemed the more urgent.

The health service was yesterday accused of showing a ‘skewed sense of priorities’ after it emerged that Oliver Dockerty, a two-year-old boy with cerebral palsy, has been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk.

Priorities: Little Oliver Dockerty, left, was refused funding for an operation which could help him walk while aspiring model Josie Cunning, right, had her breasts enlarged to 36DD at a cost of £4,800 to taxpayers

Yet just a few miles away, 22-year-old
 Josie Cunningham has been given size 36DD breasts at taxpayers’ expense
 because she convinced doctors her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’.

The two cases from Leeds have emerged 
after Oliver’s mother spoke out about how he has been denied the 
potentially life-changing procedure.

The toddler, who relies on a frame to 
move around, can have the operation only if his single mother Claire can
 raise £25,000  to have it performed privately.

Miss Dockerty, 30, said: ‘Oliver has 
splints on his legs, a flexi-stand as he hasn’t got any balance, and 
uses a walking frame to get around.

‘He wants to be jumping in muddy 
puddles like Peppa Pig. He wants to be kicking a football and he can’t 
jump on a trampoline. I’d love to see him walking unaided for his first 
day at primary school.

‘I’m a single parent and I don’t have 
that kind of money. Even if they look again at the decision, there’s 
going to be a big backlog of children like Oliver waiting to have this 
done.’ 

Turned down: Oliver, who has cerebral palsy, with mother Claire, needs a metal frame to walk

Oliver, who lives with his mother in Manchester, was referred 
for surgery at Leeds General Infirmary, which specialises in the 
procedure, known as  selective dorsal rhizotomy.

But when a surgeon applied to NHS 
England for funding, he was turned down because the procedure is not yet
 routinely covered by the health service.

The case seems particularly cruel when
 compared to that of Miss Cunningham, who had a breast enlargement on 
the NHS at nearby St James’s University Hospital, which is also part of 
the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery
 should be funded only in rare circumstances when a local trust deems it
 is needed ‘to protect a person’s health’.

Outrage: Claire Dockerty, whose son Oliver, two, needs a specialist operation in order to walk without a frame, slammed the NHS for refusing to pay for the operation

But Miss Cunningham, who works in 
telesales, convinced doctors that having a flat chest was causing her 
emotional distress. After funding was recommended by her GP and approved
 by her local primary care trust, she had a £4,800 operation, increasing
 the size of her breasts from 32A to 36DD.

She now says she has the ‘confidence’ 
to pursue her dream of topless modelling and hopes to emulate former 
Page 3 girl Katie Price, also known as Jordan.

The unmarried mother from Leeds plans 
to leave her children, Harley, five, and Frankie, two, with her parents 
while she chases her dream. She wrote on Twitter: ‘I have no regrets. My
 body is the start of my new life.’

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be stupefied that the 
same system  which funded a boob job for  an aspiring glamour model will
 not allow treatment that would enable a little boy to walk unaided. ‘It
 certainly suggests that the NHS has a skewed sense of priorities.’

A spokesman for NHS England said 
funding was granted for the operation recommended for Oliver in only 
‘exceptional cases’, adding that proposals are being considered to offer
 it more widely later in the year.’

A spokesman for the Department of 
Health said: ‘Any treatment provided by the NHS needs to be clinically 
justified, but the local NHS is best placed to make these decisions.’

Meanwhile, Claire is determined to fund the operation for her son herself and has launched her own charity page at justgiving.com/oliverwantstojoinin

Cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the NHS unless doctors decide there is a clinical need.

This decision is taken at a local level, by local clinical commissioners under the new NHS reform, on the basis of reports submitted by a patient's doctors.

Commissioners set their own criteria according to what, in their view, are the health needs of the local community.

For cosmetic surgery, the usual protocol is that the commissioners must decide there is some kind of clinical, ie health, need for the operation to be funded on the NHS. 

Simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason enough.

Leeds Primary Care Trust, also known as NHS Leeds, offers a list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website. 

They include breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), and rhytidectomy (wrinkle removal including face lift).

It says these may be available 'providing certain criteria can be met', and lists the criteria.

The criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from certain rare syndromes, severe asymmetry (more than two cup sizes difference), or lumpectomy that results in deformity.

Rare cases, however, such as Ms Cunningham's, have to be go through the Individual Funding Request process, in which each case is decided upon its individual merits.
