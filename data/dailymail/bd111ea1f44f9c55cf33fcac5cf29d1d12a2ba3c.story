A 14-year-old New Hampshire girl was filmed telling her school board off after they had her father arrested for breaching a two minute rule for speaking.

Marina Baer told the Gilford School Board ‘I don’t trust you’ only minutes after watching father William Baer being handcuffed and hauled off by a police officer at the board’s request.

The arrest came after William Baer became upset while being told to be quiet during a discussion about the book ‘Nineteen Minutes,’ which includes graphic sexual content he felt was inappropriate for a classroom.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

'I don't trust you': Marina Baer told the school board how she really feels after they had her father arrested

‘I honestly don’t feel safe around you people,’ said the high school freshman in a video of her bold stand. ‘I just watched my father get arrested because he broke the two minute rule, at a board of education meeting.

‘This just shows that you resort to force at the first turn of conflict and I am appalled,’ the teen continued. ‘So I don’t trust you.’

Her comments came after a police officer hauled her father out of the room, slapped handcuffs on him in the hallway and led him out of the school, as shown in video from WMUR.

The man was arrested for objecting to a book that includes a graphic sexual content describing rough sex between two teenagers, according to WCVB.

The sexually-charged read culminates with: ‘semen, sticky and hot, pooled on the carpet beneath her,’ according to the website BizPac Review.

‘This is ridiculous,’ William Baer said in response to another parent arguing in favour of allowing high schoolers to read the novel.

‘Why don’t you have me arrested, why don’t we do that as a civics lesson?’ He continued. ‘Nice First Amendment lesson right?

‘Nobody’s talking about censoring the book, nobody’s talking about banning the book or burning the book,’ William Baer continued as he was asked by a moderator off camera to be respectful of other people in attendance.

‘Like you’re respectful of my daughter right?’ He fired back as an officer confronted him.

Cuffed: He is then arrested and led outside before his daughter's outburst

‘You’re going to arrest me because I violated the two minute rule?’ He asks the cop.

‘This is ridiculous,’ William Baer says when the cop says he will be arrested. ‘This is the civics lesson.’

The father is then led out of the board meeting with his young daughter running behind him into the hallway and watching him being handcuffed shortly before returning to chide the board members.

His wife Barbara Baer stood by her man when interviewed by WCVB.

‘I fully understand how he feels. It really is a huge violation,’ she told the station. ‘Why should those ideas be put in their mind. They can discuss this some other way. They don’t need that kind of imagery.’

The school sent notifications home to parents, but only after students had already received the book.

It is not exactly clear what crime William Baer was charged with, and MailOnline was not able to immediately reach local authorities.
