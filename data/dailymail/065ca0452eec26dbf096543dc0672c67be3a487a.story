Privacy: Conservationists at London Zoo have been giving seahorses their own private 'honeymoon suite' in a bid to encourage breeding among the fish

Seahorses at London Zoo are given their own private 'honeymoon suite' in a bid to encourage breeding among the fish.

Conservationists have managed to boost the numbers of the protected species at the zoo by giving courting seahorses a bit of privacy - separating them from the rest of the group when they look like they are about to mate.

The zoo's work in boosting the numbers of native short and long-snouted varieties has for the last 17 years been taking place in a warehouse behind the public aquarium. But a special exhibition which opened yesterday has now made it available for all to see.

Brian Zimmerman, curator of the aquariam at London Zoo, said: 'We noticed when we kept the seahorses in bigger groups, a pair would start a courtship dance, and another male - or sometimes a female - would try to muscle in and disrupt their ability to complete a courtship.

'Now we put a mixture of males and females in a larger courtship tank, then, when we observe a couple pairing off, we give them their own individual tanks. It's their honeymoon suite.'

The work is being carried out as part of Project Seahorse, a worldwide breeding and conservation programme which aims to address what conservations believe to be the rapidly dwindling population of the fish.

Seahorses, who mate for life, perform an elaborate flirtation dance when they choose a partner, giving very clear indications before they mate.

It is when staff at the zoo see the fish carrying out such behaviour, which includes them entwining their tails, they remove them to a private breeding tank.

London Zoo also uses spherical tanks with a current running through in a bid to keep more of the offspring alive.

The tanks look to replicate ocean life for the young fry. When they are born they are removed straight away to allow their mother and father to start mating again.

When they are a little older, the young fish themselves are moved into tanks where they can select mates.
