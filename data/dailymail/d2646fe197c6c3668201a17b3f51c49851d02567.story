This year, royal baby fever saw mothers-to-be copy everything from the Duchess of Cambridge’s haircut to her maternity style. 

But they have drawn the line at the baby’s name.

The desire not to be seen as a ‘Kate copycat’ has led to a decline in the popularity of royal names, according to website BabyCentre.

Its list of the top 100 baby names for 2013 puts Olivia at the top for girls. Oliver heads the boys’ list, gaining three places from last year.

George, which had been rising in popularity since 2010, was at number nine in the boys’ chart in June 2013 – but was pushed out of the top ten after July, when Prince George was born.

Other royal names, such as William, Harry, Charles, Kate, Catherine and even Prince George’s middle name Louis also dropped in popularity this year.

It seems parents have looked further afield for inspiration.

Inspiration: Arya, the name of a character in Games of Thrones left, rose in popularity by 183 per cent, while Skyler, right a character in Braking Bad increase by 70 per cent

1920s chic: Daisy and Jay - the two main characters in The Great Gatsby, pictured - have increased in popularity by 20 and 60 per cent respectively

Skyler, the name of a character in US
 television drug drama Breaking Bad, rose in popularity by 70 per cent. 
The girl’s name Arya, from US TV series Game of Thrones, was a new entry
 to the top 100, and its popularity rose 183 per cent. 

From television show Homeland, the 
name Brody was up by 40 per cent and entered the top 100 boys’ names for
 the first time, while Nicholas was up by 11 per cent. Carrie and Dana 
also shot up, by 200 per cent  and 66 per cent respectively.

Popular
 names from the 1920s are making a come back, thanks to the film 
adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel The Great Gatsby which 
came out earlier this year, and the period drama Downton Abbey.

The names of Great Gatsby characters Daisy and Jay were up 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively.

Girls’
 names from Downton Abbey, also set in the 1920s, such as Violet, Elsie,
 Ivy, Rose, Cora and Mary, also increased in popularity too.

This
 year’s biggest risers within the top 100 girls’ names were Francesca, 
Bella and Mila while the highest new entries were Thea, Ivy, Eloise and 
Lottie.

For baby boys, the 
names that jumped the most places within the top 100 were Finley, Elijah
 and Mohammed. The highest new entries were Ollie, Jackson, Brody and 
Nathaniel.

Top pick: The name Brody, the character from Homeland right, was up by 40 per cent, entering the top 100 first time. Carrie, left, shot up by 200 per cent

The chart is based on 21,000 babies born this year and registered to the BabyCentre website.The baby name chart ranks the names chosen by over 21,000 BabyCentre.co.uk members who gave birth in 2013.

Sarah
 Barrett, of BabyCentre, said: ‘Speculation about the royal baby and 
regal names could be responsible for the decline of many names 
associated with our royal family.

'Parents fear being labelled Kate copycats but will take inspiration from well-known characters.’

The chart is based on 21,000 babies born this year and registered to the BabyCentre website.

Ms Barrett added: 'Inspiration for your baby’s name can come from anywhere, which is why a show like Breaking Bad, which has been hugely popular, has influenced naming choices this year.

'Parents fear being labelled Kate copycats but will take inspiration from well-known characters in popular TV shows or films.'
