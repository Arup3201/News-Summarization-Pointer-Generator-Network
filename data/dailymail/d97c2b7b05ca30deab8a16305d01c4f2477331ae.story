Ravel Morrison is set to return to the starting XI for West Ham’s Capital One Cup semi-final on Tuesday, despite Sam Allardyce saying he may have had his ‘head turned’ by relegation rivals Fulham.

West Ham rejected a bid for the 20-year-old, thought to be £4million, but Allardyce suggested the promise of money and agents’ advice had affected Morrison’s mindset.

Morrison came off the bench in the defeat by Newcastle on Saturday but has not started a match since the 5-0 FA Cup defeat by Nottingham Forest on January 5, when Allardyce used several of his youngsters.

Tuesday evening's match with Manchester City will be his first in a strong line-up since the game at Manchester United on December 21, when a groin injury began hampering his progress.

Morrison is said to be keen on a move to Craven Cottage, even though Fulham are only one place and one point above West Ham in the Barclays Premier League.

Contract talks have stalled to extend his £15,000-a-week deal, which has 18 months left.

Asked why a switch to Fulham would appeal to Morrison, Allardyce said: ‘It’s like everything. This window creates a hysteria.

'People will tell you somebody is going to come and get you.

‘That could then turn your head, probably based on the money that people say you’re going to make.

‘I would probably think that at every club there is a player unsettled because of mad January, this lunatic transfer window that creates havoc throughout the game.

Tale of the tape: How the teams might line up

‘You can offer the advice but whether 
they take it or not, they’re going to listen to the advice of agents 
more than they are to the manager.’

Allardyce railed: ‘Some players will act and react in a different way, to whatever they feel is best for them.

'Sometimes it’s the wrong thing to do but that’s the way they go about it.

‘Sometimes it gets handled quietly and it’s done; sometimes a player will not turn up; sometimes a player will refuse to play; sometimes a player will accept that he’s got to continue to play well for the football club if it hasn’t happened.

‘He’s a young man and a young man with not much experience. You have to give a bit of leeway for that scenario.’

‘It’s difficult for a manager to give 
advice to a young player about that as they see you probably working for
 the club rather than working for them.

He added: ‘He’s not an experienced man 
in life, never mind in football.

'And inexperienced young players can 
react in many different ways.’

Not impressed: Allardyce branded Fulham's bid for Morrison as derisory

Allardyce labelled Fulham’s bid for Morrison, West Ham’s top scorer with five goals this season, as ‘derisory’ but stopped short of declaring him ‘not for sale’, adding he had yet to achieve ‘consistency’ in his standard of play.

Allardyce said West Ham were ‘playing for pride’ against City after losing the first leg 6-0 at the Etihad.
