Atletico Madrid midfielder was rushed to hospital after suffering a 'traumatic brain injury' after colliding with a team-mate. 

The 28-year-old went up for a header with Cristian Ansaldi during a friendly win away at Wolfsburg but was knocked unconscious. 

Suarez was taken off on a stretcher before making his way to hospital where they performed a CT brain scan. 

Atletico confirmed that the Spaniard has stayed in Germany under observation as the rest of the squad travelled back. 

Ansaldi's hip appeared to clatter into Suarez's head and he was left motionless on the ground. 

But luckily he regained consciousness and should be on the mend. Suarez played five games in Diego Simeone's side's run to the Champions League final against capital rivals Real in Lisbon last season. 

Mario Mandzukic scored during the rout as Atletico won their final pre-season game before the Spanish Super Cup clash against Real.
