Loving parents from Utah who lost their disabled son when he was just 10-years-old decided to create a touching tombstone in his memory.

Ernest and Anneke Robinson welcomed Matthew to the world in 1988 and due to a lack of oxygen he was blind and paralyzed from the neck down and couldn't speak more than a few words

The Huffington Post reports that when Matthew died, his father decided to design a tombstone for him depicting the happiness he wanted for his son in both life and death.

Reaching for the sky: Ernest and Anneke Robinson built a beautiful tombstone in memory of their disabled son Matthew

Challenges: Due to lack of oxygen Matthew was blind, paralyzed from the neck down and spoke only a few words up until when he died at 11

The beautiful tombstone built in 2000, is Matthew in a wheelchair standing up and reaching for the sky.The statue stands out in the Salt Lake City cemetery.

In order to further their son's memory and help others who faced similar struggles, the Robinsons established a non-profit organization called Ability Found.

The organization helps people with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, stroke, cancer, spinal cord injuries, and multiple sclerosis to get rehabilitation equipment they might not otherwise be able to afford.

'Instead of sadness, the statue makes our son Matthew's grave a place of happiness,' Ernest told Enjoy Utah.

'Many others have found that true also.'

By helping disabled children and adults to get the equipment they need to help them lead more normal lives, the Robinson's are honoring their son's contribution to their lives.
