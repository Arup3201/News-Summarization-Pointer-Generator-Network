Eastern Europeans will help win the independence vote for Alex Salmond, according to one SNP campaigner

Eastern Europeans will vote 'Yes' in the upcoming Scottish independence referendum winning the campaign for Alex Salmond, according to one political campaigner.

Ania Lewandowska, 29, who works for SNP MEP Alyn Smith has said she is confident the party will win the referendum - thanks to the help of 'new Scots' from eastern Europe.

Ms Lewandowska said: 'Poles know that change can be for the better - they are not afraid of it.

Speaking with The Times, she added: 'Of course, some are still undecided - that's true of any sector of Scottish society - but in my mind most Poles will decide yes.'

According to the 2011 census, 55,000 Poles are thought to be living in Scotland.

About 30,000 are thought to have registered to vote so far.

However, John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said just 8 per cent of the population were EU citizens - and the likelihood of them engaging in the vote was debatable.

He said: 'EU citizens are less likely to be on the register - partly it's motivational, partly it's circumstantial. How much they engage in politics is debatable.'

Polls this week suggested the Yes campaign, which once trailed by a wide margin, was now only three points behind the No campaign.

Earlier this week, Alex Salmond marked St George's Day by speaking positively about England in a desperate bid to boost support for the break-up of Britain.

The First Minister ventured over the Border as far as Carlisle to make a speech claiming a 'strong and enduring friendship' will still endure across the British Isles if Scotland votes to leave the UK in September.

In a speech at Carlisle Cathedral, Mr Salmond said people could still live in England and work in Scotland if there is a Yes vote - ignoring warnings of passport controls and separate currencies.

He said: 'The ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after Scotland becomes independent.

Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech on St George's Day urging people to vote for a continued union

'You will remain Scotland's closest friends, as well as our closest neighbours ... people would still live in Annan and work in Carlisle, or live in Penrith and work in Lockerbie. Friends and family would continue to visit each other.'

Meanwhile, David Cameron used the day to urge his countrymen to embrace both Scots and the Union.

The Prime Minister issued his own St George's Day message - stressing England's role in creating the enduring 'family of nations' that is the UK.

In a video message, he said: 'Let's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations. Because no matter how great we are alone, we will always be greater together.'
