A university lecturer showed the strain today after he admitted drug possession following the death of a schoolgirl during a party at his house.

Isobel Jones-Reilly, 15, died after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party at Brian Dodgeon's west London home in April.

And leaving court today after admitting having a cocktail of drugs in his home, Dodgeon -  who seriously injured himself 
in a failed suicide attempt following the girl's death - showed signs of the ordeal having taken a considerable toll on him.

The 61-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of possession, including the party drugs ecstasy, LSD and ketamine, when he appeared at West London Magistrates' Court.

The 61-year-old pleaded guilty to owning a number of drugs, which were valued between £735 and £2,435

The University of London research fellow also admitted keeping psychedelic drug 5-MeO-DIPT - better known as Foxy Methoxy.

Around 30 teenagers attended the party, at Dodgeon's home in North Kensington on April 22 this year and were drinking cider, wine and spirits and smoking marijuana, magistrates were told.

Dodgeon and his partner Angela Hadjipateras were away at a party in Hastings at the time.

Prosecutor Nisha Dutt said that Dodgeon's daughter Beatrice Hadjipateras, 14, told party-goers that she had previously found a stash of cannabis in her father's drawer.

Three of the teenagers went to an 'out-of-bounds' bedroom in a bid to find more drugs.

They found a canister containing a selection of drugs including capsules, plastic containers and bags.

Ms Dutt said: 'Isobel took two tablets. Mr Dodgeon's daughter and two other youths took one each.

'By 3am Isobel had shown signs of deterioration. She had started hallucinating and became very hot and red-faced.

'Her friends wanted to call ambulance but she insisted that they did not because they would get into trouble.

'After about an hour she lay on the bed frothing at the mouth, went pale and was motionless.

'She stopped breathing and friends could not find a pulse.'

Her friends called for an ambulance and attempted to perform mouth-to-mouth and CPR.

Isobel was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington but was pronounced dead at 6.30am.

Dodgeon's 14-year-old daughter and two 14-year-old boys were also detained in hospital after the party.

Dodgeon, a former social worker, was arrested at the hospital and questioned by police.

He told officers that he was a recreational drug user and described himself as an 'old hippie', the court was told.

He said he had accumulated the drugs over a number of years.

In 'the most dramatic exhibition of remorse' Dodgeon leapt from a bridge in a suicide attempt a week after the incident, said Rhona Friedman, mitigating.

He required brain surgery, broke 
numerous bones - including a femur, an elbow and a a heel - and 
fractured his skull after he jumped off a flyover on the North Circular 
Road in Walthamstow, east London.

In court, he used a crutch to make his way to the dock and was wearing a navy suit and a white shirt.

Magistrates
heard that he did not supply the drugs to anyone and they were stored 
in his bedroom, which was off-limits to party guests - who were invited 
to the event through Facebook.

Dodgeon,
whose research subjects have included health inequalities and alcohol 
consumption patterns, told police that it had 'never crossed his mind' 
that someone would find the drugs, which were valued at between £735 and
£2,435.

But Dodgeon and his partner of 25 years knew that the party was going ahead and had warned neighbours in advance, the court was told.

Ms Friedman said that Dodgeon, who had previously worked for the National Council for Single Parent Families and as a social policy officer for the Citizens Advice Bureau, was full of 'remorse and regret' and has been abstinent since the incident.

The court was also told that Isobel, a pupil at Chiswick Community School, was going through a 'challenging' period at the time of her death.

'At the time, it was said her behaviour was being increasingly challenging,' Ms Dutt said.

'Her attendance had been poor, she had been known to smoke, drink and use cannabis.'

She added that the school had referred Isobel to drug and education services.

An inquest into the death of the teenager, who lived in South Acton, was opened and adjourned in May.

Ms Dutt told the court that the cause of her death was listed as MDMA - more commonly known as ecstasy - ingestion.

Dodgeon will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on November 18.
