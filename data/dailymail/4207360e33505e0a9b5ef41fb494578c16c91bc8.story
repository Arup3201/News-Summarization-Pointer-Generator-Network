The grieving family of teenager Conner Marshall, 18, who died following a brutal assault at a seaside caravan park have paid tribute to a 'unique and caring' son.

A man from the South Wales area was arrested in Scotland yesterday after  Conner, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, died following the assault at Treco Bay caravan park in Porthcawl.

Conner was found with multiple injuries in the early hours of Sunday March 8 but tragically died six days later at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

His grieving family have paid tribute to their 'unique, caring and compassionate' son. 

They said they were proud of Conner, who had wanted his organs to be donated.

His family released a statement which said: 'We are immensely proud that Conner chose to help others in his belief that "life goes on" by deciding to donate his organs.

'As a family we take great comfort knowing that Conner was a unique, caring and compassionate young man with a warm, infectious smile complete with a cheeky wink.

'We draw strength in the knowledge that Conner was and is brave, protective and loved unconditionally by all of his family and friends.'

Conner was a pupil at Ysgol Gyfun Bro Morgannwg in Barry until 2012 - the same school which was attended by 17-year-olds Rhodri Miller and Corey Price, who died following a crash on the A470 in Brecon on March 6. 

A statement on the school's website said: 'We received the news about Conner Marshall with sadness.

'We extend our sincere sympathies to his family and friends.'

Police said Conner had been staying in the caravan park with friends and they spent the evening on of Saturday March 7 in bars in and around Porthcawl.

The group returned to the caravan before midnigh, which is when detectives believe Conner decided to walk to the beach.

Conner was rushed to hospital after being found with multiple injuries but  died six days after the attack

At 7am the following morning he was found with multiple injuries to his body with limited responsiveness.

Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'We have a distinct time line of midnight to 7am on Sunday morning and I am appealing for anyone who may have seen anything during these hours to come forward.

'Conner was wearing a purple shirt, black skinny jeans, grey Adidas trainers, a blue/grey jacket and was carrying a grey Nike shoulder bag.

'Our officers are continuing to conduct inquiries to establish the full circumstances of what happened; however, we have identified a suspect and arrested a local South Wales man in Scotland.'

He stressed that the suspect was not part of the group of friends staying in the caravan with Conner that evening.

He said: 'Parkdean Trecco Bay Management are continuing to work closely with South Wales Police.

'Our thoughts are with Conner's family and all those affected by this tragic incident.

'This was a brutal attack and I believe the suspect may have shared information with friends, relatives or neighbours.'

South Wales Police are urging anyone with any information to come forward following Conner's death
