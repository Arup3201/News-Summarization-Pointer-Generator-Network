Appointed: John Witherow takes over as acting editor of the Times after 18 years at the helm of the Sunday Times

A new interim editor of The Times has been announced despite opposition from the newspaper's independent directors.

John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times for the past 18 years, takes over from James Harding, who stood down last month.

Mr Witherow is understood to have been the choice of Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The Times's parent company, who is thought to want to merge both titles in a seven-day operation.

Such a move could mean waiving legal undertakings Mr Murdoch signed in 1981 to keep the titles separate.

The deputy editor of the Sunday Times, Martin Ivens, has been made its acting editor.

Mr Witherow, 60 tomorrow,Â  will start at The Times immediately subject to formal approval by The Times independent directors, said News International chief executive Mike Darcey said in a statement

He added: 'Following a meeting of the independent national directors yesterday we welcome their clear understanding of the very difficult financial position of our newspapers and therefore the need to address the undertakings given in 1981.

'A thorough assessment of the undertakings will enable them to make recommendations to us and to government as to how the newspapers can be structured in order to reduce their costs and become economically viable.

'However, during this interim period of continued consultation over the undertakings, we still have a responsibility to provide these two newspapers and their journalists with strong and stable leadership.'

Backing: Corporation chief Rupert Murdoch with new Times acting editor John Witherow

Mr Harding left his post last month. 
He said it had been made clear to him that the publishers wanted to 
appoint a new editor.

Mr Witherow was seen as the favourite to succeed him, but the reshuffle
has been delayed amid rows over the possible merger of the two 
titles.

Talks between News International and the paper's independent directors are now effectively at a stand-off, according to the BBC.

News International management had expected Mr Witherow's appointment to be formally approved at a meeting two days ago.

The six independent directors include Veronica Wadley, a former editor of the London Evening 
Standard; Rupert Pennant-Rea, a former editor of the Economist and 
deputy governor of the Bank of England; and Stephen Grabiner, a venture 
capitalist who previously held senior commercial posts at the Daily 
Telegraph and the Daily Express.

Mr Murdoch signed legal undertakings 
with Margaret Thatcher's government that The Times and Sunday Times had 
to be kept separate.

The appointment of The Times editor had to be approved by the paper's 
independent national directors to protect editorial freedom.

But other newspaper groups like the Daily Telegraph are now moving to seven-day working, to cope with 
tougher financial conditions in the industry.

The
BBC said that it understood News International has taken informal 
advice from the Department of Culture Media and Sport, over whether the 
government might allow the undertakings to be lifted and how that might be done.
