A motorist was caught drink-driving - while parking his car near a court where he was due to stand trial.

John Graham, 58, left his Toyota MR2 illegally near Plymouth Magistrates' Court, where he was supposed to face a jury on charges of fraud.

But a passing police officer spotted the vehicle obstructing an entrance and Graham failed a breath test.

John Graham, 58, was caught drink-driving parking his car near a court where he was due to stand trial 

He then appeared in two courts on the same day – standing trial over the bogus sale of a £38,000 Range Rover before appearing before city magistrates on a drink-driving charge.

After the trial Graham, of Wadebridge, Cornwall, was convicted of fraud and jailed for two years. 

The drink-driving case, which had been adjourned, resumed on Thursday when lawyer Alan Harris said Graham had ‘combed the streets’ in June as he rushed to find a parking space.

Graham had heard that another defendant had been lambasted by the judge for being late, he added. 

The case was adjourned until Monday.
