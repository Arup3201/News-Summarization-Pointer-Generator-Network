Police are searching for three people who bashed a young woman in her bed after breaking into her home in the middle of the night.

The 26-year-old woman was sleeping at 3.30am on Sunday in her Fairfield flat in Sydney's west when the intruders, believed to be three men, entered her apartment by smashing a window. 

One of the men attacked her viciously until her nose and mouth was bleeding, whilst two other people looked on.

'I really thought I was going to die that night,' the victim, who is too scared to reveal her identity, told Nine News. 

'I really thought they were going to come in, sexually assault me and murder me.'

It's understood the men climbed over two fences and smashed her window with a brick to gain entry into the young woman's room.  

A man sat on top of the young woman in her bed and repetitively punched her face. 

'He got on top of me, pinned me down because I was struggling and trying to get away.

'He just started hitting me and hitting me.

The terrified victim hopes those responsible are found before someone else suffers the same awful treatment
