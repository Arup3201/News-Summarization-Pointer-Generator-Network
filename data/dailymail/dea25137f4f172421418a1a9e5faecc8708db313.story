A man who robbed an Illinois convenience store on Friday apparently donned a clear plastic bag in an attempt to hide his identity.

The robbery took place at a Circle K store in Belleville, KMOX reported.

Security camera footage released by Belleville police and shared with the affiliate station shows the plastic covering the bottom half of the man's head.

His face and glasses, however, are clearly visible through his disguise.

It is not clear if the man's mask was actually meant to protect from inclement weatherÂ  - the day of the robbery, Belleville experienced .05 inches of rain, according to Weather.com.

The suspect has not yet been identified. KMOX's report did not say how much he stole from the convenience store.

Belleville police did not immediately return a request for information from MailOnline.

Friday's incident is not the only Circle K robbery to occur in Belleville.

In October 2013 London Brown pleaded guilty to robbing a Circle K twice last summer, the Department of Justice said.
