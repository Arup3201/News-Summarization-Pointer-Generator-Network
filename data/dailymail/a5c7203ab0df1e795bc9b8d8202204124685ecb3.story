British women are hoarding a staggering 4.67 billion pounds worth of clothes in their wardrobes which they will never wear, according to a new study.

The typical woman has six items of unworn clothing in her wardrobe - with the tags still on them. That’s 162 million pieces nationwide.

And they have an additional 15 items of clothes and shoes they’ve worn just once and will never put on again.

Most confess it’s because they got carried away in the sales, while 28 per cent have bought items too small as inspiration to slim.

These women were typically aiming to lose a stone in weight to squeeze into their tops and dresses.The result is that the typical British woman admits harbouring 173 pounds worth of clothes they have no intention of wearing but can't bear to throw out.

The research, by British Heart Foundation (BHF) Shops, suggests the main reason for splashing out on clothes or shoes which will never see the light of day is the irresistible appeal of a bargain.

A third of women (36 per cent) got carried away and snapped something up in a sale, before realising it was quite unsuitable.

A quarter of the women polled bought clothes or footwear without trying them on, only to find they did not fit

A quarter (23 per cent) bought clothes or footwear without trying them on, only to find they did not fit.

And one in six (17 per cent) are clinging on to clothes they bought too small in the hope it would spur them on to slim down - to no avail.

Half of women (45 per cent) admit to having clothes which remain unworn because they are too tight.

Meanwhile, 25 per cent leave items in the wardrobe because they are unflattering and 12 per cent keep hold of unwanted gifts in case they need to show they still have them.

The unworn items most likely to be packing the nation’s wardrobes are high heels, tight dresses, bright or logo T-shirts, skinny jeans, low-cut tops, miniskirts, bikinis, hot pants and crop tops.

Office worker Lorna Rousewell, 25, of Portsmouth, Hants, said: 'I’ve got unworn tops and dresses hanging in my wardrobe which still have the labels on.

'I love a bargain and tend to get carried away in the sales. Then you get home, try them on and they don’t look as good. But if they were bought in the sale you often can’t a proper refund. It’s such a waste.'BHF Shops, which surveyed 2,274 people, is appealing for bags of unwanted things this September as they launch the Great British Bag-athon in the fight for every heartbeat.

It found a quarter of women (28 per cent) have purchased an item of clothing in a size too small as inspiration to lose weight.

Meanwhile 20 per cent admit the clothing looked great in the shop, on a celebrity, model or friend - but not so hot when they got it home.

Diane Locke, BHF Deputy Retail Director, said: 'We’re all guilty of hanging onto clothes we’ve barely worn or in many cases, never worn at all.

'It’s interesting women have so many items they’ve not worn at all and that these are worth as much as £173.

'BHF shops have the perfect solution for the items cluttering your wardrobe this month - the UK’s biggest stock donation appeal, the Great British Bag-athon.'Fashion expert Hilary Alexander said: 'People often buy items on impulse, without trying them on properly, and only realise once they get home that they’re not flattering or don’t fit well.

'We all have to accept that if we haven’t worn an item after owning it for six months it’s time to move on.'
