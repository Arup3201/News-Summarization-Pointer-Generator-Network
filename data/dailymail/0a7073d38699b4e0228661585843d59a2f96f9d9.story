VIDEO Team Profile: Germany highlights

Key clash: Karim Benzema (France) v Per Mertesacker (Germany)

Benzema is likely to be paired with Antoine Griezmann, who has looked a much more natural partner for the frontman than Olivier Giroud. That should allow him to run at defenders through the middle and while Mertesacker has had an excellent season at Arsenal, Benzema could exploit his lack of pace on the ground.

One to watch: Thomas Muller (Germany)

The attacker has nine World Cup goals to his name in just two tournaments. He will hoping to add to his tally of four at the current tournament to propel his side into the last four.

Head-to-head record: Played 25, France Wins 11, Draws 6, Germany Wins 8

Boot room bet: HT Draw, FT Draw, 7/2 

Powerhouse: France striker Karim Benzema is likely to cause a serious threat to Germany's defence

No nation has ever made the last four in four successive tournaments.•    Germany are unbeaten in 15 internationals (W10 D5), longer than any other side still involved at the World Cup.•    On the last five occasions that France have progressed past round 1 in the World Cup, they have reached the semi-final stage (1958, 1982, 1986, 1998 and 2006).•    All of France’s goals during this World Cup have come from inside the box (10).•    France have lost only one of their 10 games played on Brazilian soil (W6 D3).•    France are the first team to benefit from two own goals in the same World Cup.•    Les Bleus have hit the woodwork more often than any other team at this World Cup (6), which is the highest tally for a team since Poland and Argentina in 1982 (both 6).•    Thomas Müller (four goals, two assists) has been directly involved in six of Germany’s nine goals (66.7 per cent) at this this World Cup.•    Karim Benzema (19) has fired in 12 more shots than any other French player during this tournament.•    André Schürrle has scored five goals in his last five competitive matches for Germany.•    Miroslav Klose needs one more goal to be the World Cup’s highest scorer.

Supersub: Veteran Germany striker Miroslav Klose needs just one more goal to break the World Cup record

Team news:

Germany have been hit by signs of the flu in their camp, with Thomas Muller one of several players feeling under the weather. But Joachim Low insists that his players will all be fit to play, minus Shkodran Mustafi who will miss the rest of the tournament with a hamstring injury. Low's biggest headache is whether to play Phillip Lahm in midfield or right-back, with Sami Khedira potentially taking his place in the middle of the park. Mats Hummels is set to return in defence after missing the win against Algeria with a fever.

France look set to bring Antoine Griezmann in to the side in place of Olivier Giroud, who was unable to forge an effective strike partnership with Karim Benzema against Nigeria in the last 16. Didier Deschamps will bring back Liverpool’s Mamadou Sakho, who has recovered from a leg injury, in central defence at the expense of Arsenal’s Laurent Koscielny.
