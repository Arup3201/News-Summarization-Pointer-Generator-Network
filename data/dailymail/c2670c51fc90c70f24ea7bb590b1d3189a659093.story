Andy Murray is so determined to maintain his positive start to the tennis season that he is shelving any plans for a honeymoon until the end of the year in November.

And the world No 4, who is marrying Kim Sears on April 11 in Dunblane Cathedral, has not entirely ruled out playing in the Monte Carlo Open in the week immediately afterwards.

He thinks that unlikely, but as one of the most momentous days in his eventful life looms he is adamant that he can compartmentalise such questions and focus on the Miami Open, his last tournament as a single man.

After reaching the semi-final in Indian Wells last week Murray is now the second highest points scorer on the ATP Tour this year, albeit some way behind the dominant Novak Djokovic.

He now arrives at the event hosted by the city he considers a second home – where plays either Donald Young or Yen Hsun Lu – and is not finding it hard to separate the two biggest things in his life, happy to discuss the forthcoming nuptials with Kim when relaxing at his downtown apartment.

'Tennis is important but we also have lives to live as well,' he said on Tuesday. 'When I'm on the court I'm not thinking "I'm getting married in a few weeks" but back at the apartment there's time to do that. I can concentrate on both. 

'As long as it's not in the forefront of my mind when I'm training then it's fine. It hasn't been a problem for me yet and I don't see it as an issue.'

Whatever happens at this tournament the 27 year-old Scot will not rush back across the Atlantic: 'Hopefully it won't finish for me here until a week on Sunday and then I'll go home after that,' said Murray, who is having not just one but three best men: brother Jamie, former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins and an old friend from Spain, Carlos Mier.

'If I don't do well I'm going to stay here anyway and train on the clay and get used to playing in hot conditions. Regardless of how I do I'll be here for the next ten days.'

With his 28th birthday looming time is short and Murray's first few weeks as a married man will involve getting stuck into the clay with little luxuriating in his new status. He will play in Munich, Madrid and Rome before the French Open, and might even take his new bride straight to the Riviera. 'Depending on how I feel after the wedding there's potential to play Monte Carlo, but I'd say that's unlikely. The honeymoon won't be until the end of the year.'

It was this time last year that he split from Ivan Lendl in a tumultuous week when he cut a distraught figure, and he now feels far more settled with the Czech's replacement Amelie Mauresmo.

'My mind is a lot clearer and I think that's shown,' he said. 'Last year I came here and had struggled for the first three months and physically I was still not feeling great after surgery. I hadn't seen Ivan much, probably for only three to four weeks since my surgery (in late September) and there wasn't much direction. That carried on for a bit after I finished here.

'I was disappointed with how I played against Novak on Saturday but otherwise I felt I played well at Indian Wells. I hadn't played well there for about five years and this was by far the best in that time.'

A look at the 'Race for London' confirms this has been a decent start to the year for Murray, with him ahead of Tomas Berdych, Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, in that order.

The perception that he has stuttered might have been inflated by the loss to the imperious Djokovic. The world No 4 took one of his near three million followers on Twitter to task on Monday for questioning his methods in a curiously long exchange – you never know what you are going to get from Murray on social media, but at least he does not leave his account to others for mere PR puffs.

In the hot mid-day sun on Tuesday he went well beyond the call of duty doing pictures and autographs, having also discussed his hiring of Jonas Bjorkman as assistant coach.

The Swede cannot join him until he is knocked out of his country's version of Strictly Come Dancing. 'We spoke on the phone for two and a half hours,' Murray revealed. 'The time went very quickly. He has also spoken to Amelie on the phone and apparently they also got along very well.'
