Sam Allardyce accused Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic of trying to con referee Michael Oliver into awarding a penalty during West Ham’s 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge.

Ivanovic collided with Andy Carroll in the first half and was abused by furious Hammers’ players when he went down the tunnel at half-time.

Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho claimed it was a clear penalty and went on to accuse Enner Valencia of ‘diving’ after he attempted to win a free-kick in the first half.

Allardyce said: ‘I thought he went down looking for a penalty. Entitled? I don't know about entitled. They try and make the referees' mind up for them. ‘Staying on your feet does not get rewarded if you're fouled. We all know that.’ 

Asked if Ivanovic should have been booked for going down so easily inside the penalty area, the West Ham chief replied: ‘You'll have to ask him. Knock on his door. I'm not paying any more money to the FA.’ 

Chelsea’s players are beginning to get a reputation within the game for diving after Gary Cahill, Diego Costa and Willian were all accused of trying to win free kicks against Hull on December 13.

Mourinho continues to insist that the Barclays Premier League leaders are clean and accused Valencia of cheating.

The Chelsea chief added: ‘I think it's a penalty. The other guy grabs him if you look at it on television. ‘But it was an isolated situation. The game was good, aggressive but correct. The only guy who dived was Valencia, not in the box, and no one reacted negatively.

‘This was a good victory for us, a good performance from the referee, a good performance even if it was a defeat for them.’
