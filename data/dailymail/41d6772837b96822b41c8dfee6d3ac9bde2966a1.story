These are some of the stunning images of the heavens submitted by astrophotographers looking to win the Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2014.

The competition which is run by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich features an amazing selection of images from the night sky.

The winners will be announced on September 18 and will be featured in a special display at the museum in Greenwich. The competition is currently in its sixth year.Â
