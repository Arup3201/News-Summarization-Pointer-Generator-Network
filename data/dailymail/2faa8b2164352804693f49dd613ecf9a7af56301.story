Kieran Crump-Raiswell was stabbed to death on his way to hand out CVs

A man is being questioned on suspicion of murder after a 'caring and quiet' teenager died when he was stabbed in the heart in broad daylight.

A 26-year-old man from Bracknell, 
Berkshire, was arrested last night on suspicion of murder and remained 
in police custody for questioning, a spokesman for Greater Manchester 
Police said.

The family of 18-year-old Kieran Crump-Raiswell said he 'had his whole life ahead of him', and may have been intending to hand out his CV to shops and businesses in Manchester city centre when he was attacked in Whalley Range on January 16.

CCTV footage released by police shows Mr Crump-Raiswell walking along Upper Chorlton Road just minutes before he was killed, listening to music on his headphones, carrying his rucksack and apparently 'oblivious' to what was about to unfold.

Seconds later his killer emerged from bushes on a side street and attacked him from behind with a knife at 2.20pm before running off.

He was given first aid by a passing fire crew but his injuries proved too severe and he later died in hospital. A post-mortem examination concluded he died from a stab wound to the chest.

Kieran was a former student at Loreto Sixth Form College in Manchester, and previously a pupil at nearby Chorlton High School.

He had successfully completed his A Levels in politics, history and physical education last summer and was taking a gap tear before going to Sheffield Hallam University to read history.

The teenager had recently returned from the USA where he had been coaching football for three months.

The youngster 'had his whole life ahead of him', his family said, and was due to start university in September after finishing his gap year. The day before he was killed he had been handing out his CV to local businesses.

Police have discounted robbery as a 
motive and said they simply have 'no idea' why he was targeted in an 
apparently random attack.

Football fan: 18-year-old Kieran supported Manchester City and had recently coached football in the US

Kieran had a Manchester City season ticket and had met his football idol Carlos Tevez

Detective
Chief Inspector Peter Marsh, from Greater Manchester Police's Major 
Incident Team, said: 'We have made an arrest but the investigation is 
continuing.

'I still want to
hear from you if you saw Kieran walking along Upper Chorlton Road on 
Wednesday afternoon or if you saw anyone acting suspiciously.'

Mr Crump-Raiswell lived with his 
father, an interpreter, and mother, a council worker, along with a 
younger brother and sister in a £220,000 terraced property the affluent 
Chorlton area of south Manchester.

Grammar school educated Mr Crump works
as an interpreter having earlier been employed as a German and French 
teacher and a local government housing officer and also a tour guide.

A Manchester City season ticket 
holder, Kieran played for a local amateur football club, coached 
youngsters at his younger brother's football club and played cricket at 
Sale Cricket Club.

He was a right-handed batsman for Rostherne Cricket Club first team in the Cheshire village of Rostherne near Knutsford.

He was due to go to Sheffield Hallam University in the autumn to study history.

In a statement, the family described him as a loving, caring, quiet and easy-going young man.

The statement said: 'Kieran was our eldest son and a caring brother to his younger brother and sister.

'He was a loving grandson, nephew, cousin, friend and he was loved by all who knew him. He had his whole life ahead of him.'

The family’s next door neighbour Nick Dearden, 44, solicitor and law lecturer said: 'There’s no understanding to what happened to Kieran. He was an excellent young man and I can’t imagine how his family are going to cope with his death.

'He was the eldest, Anna was 16 and Paddy 13 and they were always looking out for each other. He always looked after them. He was a football coach and he was always practising and kicking out the back and on the street.

'I am just so shocked he was a very quiet lad very family orientated and most of the time you would see them out as a family. he was going to university this summer he was a bright lad I think he was studying either politics or politics and history.

'He had got a place at Sheffield Hallam University and was looking forward to it. As neighbours we all looked out for each other they are fantastic neighbours he was such a lovely quiet lad I’m not sure whether he had a girlfriend or not.

'He was a keen footballer and cricketer and a massive Manchester City fan I think he had a season ticket too. He only came back from America a bit ago after a few months coaching football in America in Virginia.

'I believe he was very talented to be coaching football at such a young age.

'He had his life ahead of him it wasn’t like he was waiting around with no plan. One of the surprising things was that he did not ever seem to go through that stroppy teenager faze and never lost interest with his younger siblings.

'I used to see him kicking the ball in the street I was told he had a massive talent.

Det Chief Insp Peter Marsh: 'I still want to hear from you if you saw anyone acting suspiciously.'

'It really makes no sense at all I can only imagine that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I walk up and down the street in broad daylight you just do not expect something like this to happen.

'There really is nothing to point in the direction of him being involved in anything untoward. I can’t imagine him being involved in anything that would be improper.'

Aidan Bruce Assistant Principal Loreto College said: 'The college community is shocked to learn of the news of Kieran’s tragic death.

'He was a most gentle and friendly young man, who was liked and admired by everyone who met him.

'He successfully completed his A Levels in Politics, History and Physical Education in summer 2012 and he was taking a Gap Year before going to Sheffield Hallam University to read History.

Appeal for witnesses: Officers said the area would have been very busy at the time of the stabbing

'He had recently returned from the USA where he had been coaching football for 3 months. In the preceding year he had visited the USA with the college’s History/Politics Department.

'His teachers and friends are devastated by this news and our deepest sympathy goes to his family and friends.'

In tributes on Twitter, friend Cara Kerr, 18, said: 'Just thinking things over and over and it doesn't make sense. He is an amazing guy who in 11 years I only heard swear once.

'Unbelievable, he wouldn't of stood up for himself. It's disgusting, couldn't of happened to a nicer person.

'Can't believe such an amazing person has been taken so soon'

Rhys Bailey said: 'I can't get my head round it, the guy wouldn't hurt a fly. Some horrible people out there.'

Rizwan Anjum said: 'Can't believe it.. RIP Kieran, he was such a quiet kid and kept himself to himself.'

Adam Keyworth said: 'Another young lad taken too soon.'

Hamza Limbada said: 'Nobody deserves to go like that, especially someone so nice and quiet, RIP Kieran. The good die young.'
