An obsessed TV producer who hounded a former classmate for eight years was branded 'the stalker who wouldn't stop stalking'.

Elliot Fogel, a freelance producer for Sky Sports news, has been convicted of breaching a restraining order for the third time. He was jailed for four months last year for a previous breach.

He Googled therapist Claire Waxman more than 40,000 times in one year, broke into his victim's car and made hundreds of late-night phone calls to her home.

Fogel, 36, of Edgware, 
north-west London, first developed an unhealthy obsession with Mrs 
Waxman while they were students at a college in St Albans, 
Hertfordshire.

After repeatedly telling him to leave
her alone, she heard nothing more until she received a dinner 
invitation from him ten years later - which she declined.

A few months later, in December 2003,
Fogel was spotted jogging on the spot outside Mrs Waxman's home and began spending more and more time around her workplace. 

After his arrest, a police search of 
his computer revealed he had Mrs Waxman's wedding photographs and a 
Google Earth aerial map of her home. 

He had also paid for background 
searches to be carried out on both her husband, Marc, and her father, and had
posed as a prospective parent at the nursery her daughter attended.

A restraining order was put on him in
2006, which he breached the following year.

He was jailed for sixteen 
weeks in January last year for a further breach, but he went on to 
breach it again and has now appeared before a court for the fourth time.

The original order banned him from 
going to her home address, her parents' address or within a mile of her 
work after she told the court she felt like a 'sitting duck'.

She said she suffered a miscarriage, developed an eating disorder and had to move
home five times as a result of her ordeal.

On February 1 this year Fogel 
entered the exclusion zone again on the same day a court dismissed a 
civil case brought by the stalker against his victim, who he claimed had
waged a Facebook 'hate campaign' against him.

Giving evidence from behind a screen 
at Wood Green Crown Court, Mrs Waxman said she left her office on 
Station Parade, Willesden, and walked to her car parked in Blenheim 
Gardens nearby on her way to pick up her son from nursery - a routine 
she followed the same time most days.

The 36-year old said: 'Halfway down I
felt a car slowly driving next to me. I was on the phone to my husband 
to tell him about the results of the case and felt the car next to me. 

'I walked over and was shocked. I 
could see Mr Fogel looking at me. I recognised his car and I recognised 
him. He was right by the kerb and I was on the pavement right next to 
him. 

'I shouted to my husband, "I have to 
go", because I wanted to take a picture of him on my phone. But he saw 
me and drove off. I rang staff at my work because I was shaking. 

'It was slow enough for him to stop and look at me. He gave me a very strange smirk.'

Fogel claimed that while he was aware
he was going through the exclusion zone, it was the easiest route for 
him to reach Willesden Green County Court, where the legal proceedings 
were taking place, and it was a chance encounter.

Nevertheless, Julie Whitby, prosecuting, said 
it was simply an attempt to force Mrs Waxman
to court so he could see her. 

Speaking when Fogel was originally jailed for the breach she said: 'This is a case of the 
stalker who will not stop stalking. This is a man who has a history of 
harassing Claire Waxman. He is an intelligent young man who knows what 
he is up to. 

'If you have an obsession with someone, bringing them to court is one way of seeing them, of coming into contact with them. 

'It is another form of stalking. Make
sure she is there and have contact with her. She thought there was a 
restraining order in place to protect her. 

'We have a young man who is without 
regard for the order and with every intention of keeping up his campaign
of harassment against Claire Waxman. It is a case of "chip, chip 
chip".' 

Elliot Fogel is to be sentenced next month.
