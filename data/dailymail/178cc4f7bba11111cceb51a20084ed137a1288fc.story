Jim Davidson has today denied he sexually assaulted two women and declared: 'I'm a real gentleman'.

The five-times married comedian was speaking for the first time since he was arrested by police investigating the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal.

He was detained at Heathrow Airport last 
Wednesday after landing to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, which he says left him 'completely gobsmacked'.

Denial: Jim Davidson, pictured with his fifth wife Michelle Cotton, and insists the Met has got it wrong and that he is a 'gentleman'

The comedian ‘vigorously denies’ the allegations, which date back around 25 years and insists: 'I've never forced myself on a woman in my life'.

Speaking about a 'really beautiful dancer' who drank too much after a panto performance he said: 'She was very, very drunk and I didn’t want her to go home in a cab on her own late at night in that state,' he told a friend, according to The Sun.

The comic said he put her in his hotel bed and he slept on the floor.

'I never laid a finger on her even though she was completely comatose and wouldn’t have had a clue what was going on,' he went on.

'That’s what kind of bloke I am — I’m a gentleman.'

Mr Davidson said he was being picked up by a car taking him to Big Brother when the police called him on his mobile.

He said he couldn't digest that they were planning to arrest him.

Missing: With the show now in full swing, the Big Brother House is without Jim Davidson after he pulled out

Mr Davidson is believed to be in hiding after his arrest, and may already have flown out of the country to Dubai after being released on bail last week.

Sources say that Mr Davidson may now have gone back to the Middle East, where he spent two weeks over Christmas.

The Met Police told MailOnline they would not discuss his bail conditions.

There is no suggestion Mr Davidson has absconded.

On January 2 Davidson was taken to a 
London police station and questioned for hours on suspicion of 
committing sexual offences before being released on bail until March.

He
was going to be on Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother but at the last 
minute they agreed to re-jig its line-up at the last minute after talks 
with the comedian.

Investigation: Police officers arriving at Jim Davidson's home after his arrest over alleged sexual offences

In October Davidson, who formerly 
hosted BBC shows Big Break and The Generation Game, publicly labelled 
the Savile investigation a ‘witch hunt’.

On his blog he wrote: ‘The Savile 
witch hunt is going a bit silly now. We all are starting to speculate 
and accuse ... even in jest. So no, I don’t know who’s next.

‘Everyone has had the nod. Everyone is
an expert. Just pick someone you don’t like and say it’s them.

'As odd 
as he was, Savile can’t defend himself. The bloke’s dead for God’s sake.
Let’s move on.’

Several plain-clothed police officers 
spent more than four hours searching Davidson’s £1million Georgian home 
in the picturesque village of Stockbridge in Hampshire.

They left the property carrying boxes which appeared to contain plastic evidence bags and brown envelopes.

Arrests: Davidson and an unnamed 53-year-old were on the same day as police investigate accusations made in the wake of revelations about disgraced Jimmy Savile

Davidson has often courted controversy by telling offensive jokes about ethnic minorities, homosexuals and the disabled.

He has divorced four times and in 2011
married his fifth wife, Michelle Cotton, 17 years his junior.

Davidson and the 53-year-old man are 
the ninth and tenth arrests made in the Savile investigation, called 
Operation Yewtree.

Detectives are working through an arrest list of 
people who could be questioned about allegations made by victims of 
Savile or others associated with him.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A 
53-year-old man was arrested at approximately 8am at an address in 
Hampshire and taken into custody locally.

‘A 59-year-old man was arrested at approximately midday in West London and taken into custody at a London police station.’

Scotland Yard said a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far.

And 589 people have come forward with 
information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints 
against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse, 
police said.

Ten weeks after the launch of 
Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which
Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape.

Others who have been arrested include 
former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr and publicist Max 
Clifford. Those three are on police bail.

The
investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly 
involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against 
associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.
