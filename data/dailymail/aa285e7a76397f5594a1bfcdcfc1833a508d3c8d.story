David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust jumpsuit and hand-written lyrics are among items chosen from the singer's vast collection of 60,000 objects set to go on public display for the first time.

Bowie, 65, gave curators at London's Victoria and Albert museum rare access to his huge personal archive in New York for what is being billed as the first museum Bowie retrospective.

More than 300 objects have been selected for the show which opens next spring and will feature instruments, sketches, musical scores, diary entries and album artwork.

London

The museum, which plans to hold an academic symposium on the singer, picked out 60 stage costumes as well as photography, film, music videos, set designs and storyboards.

The show has been curated by the V&A and Bowie recently took to Facebook to deny that he was directly involved in the exhibition.

'Contrary to recently published reports relating to the announcement by the V&A of an upcoming David Bowie exhibition, I am not a co-curator and did not participate in any decisions relating to the exhibition,' he said.

'The David Bowie Archive gave unprecedented access to the V&A and museum's curators have made all curatorial and design choices.'

Organisers said the show would trace the star's 'reinvention across five decades', the way he inspired others to 'pursue freedom of expression' and his influence on movements in art and culture.

Curators said Bowie's influence was not just cultural but political and that he was a worthy subject of a university doctorate.

Co-curator Geoffrey Marsh said: 'We're aiming for a ground-breaking exhibition to reflect a ground-breaking artist'.

He
 added that it had an 'almost impossible task' of appealing to the 
'dedicated fan who already knows everything' and its general audience.

He said: 'Bowie has played a crucial role in the shaping of modern society because of his focus on personal self-expression.

'He
 might not have intended to do this ... but help change the world he did
 and the ripples of those changes continue to move outwards around the 
globe today.'

Costumes include the Ziggy Stardust 
jumpsuit (1972), designed in collaboration with Bowie and inspired by 
Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange.

Bowie appeared on Top Of The Pops with
 flame-orange hair, make-up, multi-coloured clothing and red patent 
boots to perform Starman, the first single from the album The Rise And 
Fall Of Ziggy Stardust, on July 6, 1972 in a 'watershed moment' for rock
 music and youth culture.

The
 show, which organisers plan to tour the UK and overseas, will also 
feature the Union flag coat designed by Bowie and Alexander McQueen for 
the Earthling album cover (1997).

Bowie,
 who now lives in the US, was born David Robert Jones in 1947 in 
Brixton, south London, and adopted his stage name in 1965.

His most famous creation, Ziggy Stardust, a human manifestation of an alien being, was created in 1972.

Visitors will also be able to see the set
 model for the Diamond Dogs tour and the contact sheet from the Aladdin 
Sane (1973) album cover shoot, which featured Bowie with a 'lightning 
flash' design on his face and which has been referenced by celebrities 
from Lady Gaga to Kate Moss.

The show will feature excerpts from the film The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976) and music videos Boys Keep Swinging (1979) and chart-topper Let's Dance (1983) as well as recently uncovered footage of Bowie performing Jean Genie on Top Of The Pops in 1973.

David Bowie Is, sponsored by Gucci and Sennheiser, runs from March 23 to July 28, 2013.
