Dylan Farrow's brother has broken his silence to dismiss claims that his father Woody Allen sexually assaulted her - instead saying that their mother Mia Farrow poisoned their minds against him.

'Of course Woody did not molest my sister,' Moses Farrow, who is estranged from Dylan and Mia Farrow but remains close to his father, told People magazine.

Moses, 36, spoke out on Wednesday - four days after Dylan, 28, penned an open letter in the New York Times claiming Allen sexually assaulted her at age seven, reigniting a firestorm of speculation about the nature of the award-winning director's relationships with his children.

Dylan has angrily responded to Moses' new claims - including that Mia Farrow hit them - lambasting him for turning against the family, and saying: 'My brother is dead to me.'

Moses, like Dylan, was adopted by 
Allen and Farrow, but unlike his sister, he remains close to his father 
and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and 
another partner.

He has not spoken to his mother in years - and blames her for Dylan's claims about sexual assault.

'My
 mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the 
family and sexually molesting my sister,' he told People magazine.

'And I hated him for her for years. I see now that this was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.'

Moses,
 a family therapist, claimed that his sister was also exited to see 
Allen when he visited, and only started hiding from him when Mia Farrow 
successfully began turning her children against him.

He added that, on the day Dylan claims she was sexually assaulted by Woody, no one went into separate rooms and 'my mother was conveniently out shopping'.

'I don't know if my sister really 
believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother,' he added. 
'Pleasing my mother was very powerful motivation because to be on her 
wrong side was horrible.'

He
 said that although Mia - who has a total of 14 biological and adopted 
children - was portrayed as a caring mother, the reality was quite the 
opposite.

'I was often hit as a child,' he claimed, saying her rages were 'intimidating' and 'often horrifying'.

Family split: Moses Farrow, in 1992, was adopted in 1980 and he remains close to Allen

Dylan
 told People magazine that she was shocked by her brother's claims. She 
denied that their mother hit them or coached her to make accusations 
against her father.

'This
 is such a betrayal to me and my whole family,' she said. 'My memories 
are the truth and they are mine and I will live with that for the rest 
of my life.'

She added: 'I will not see my family dragged down like this. I can't stay silent when my family needs me and I will not abandon them like Soon-Yi and Moses. My brother is dead to me.'

in response to the firestorm, Mia Farrow, tweeted: 'I love my daughter. I will always protect her. A lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me. But this is not about me, it's about her truth.'

The continued swipes on Wednesday came as TMZ unearthed a 1976 interview with People magazine in which Allen described a hypothetical orgy involving him and 15 12-year-old girls.

Then 41, Allen said: 'I'm open-minded about sex. I'm not above reproach; if anything, I'm below reproach. I mean, if I was caught in a love nest with fifteen 12-year-old girls tomorrow, people would think, yeah, I always knew that about him.'

He added: 'Nothing I could come up with would surprise anyone ... I admit to it all.'

Dylan Farrow's gut-wrenching 
first-person account, which was published online on Saturday, marked the
 first time she directly addressed the alleged sex abuse.

She
 explained how, at age seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led 
her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house.

Denial: Allen, pictured Monday, has denied the accusations, which he found 'overwhelmingly sad'

Defense: In a tweet on Tuesday, Mia Farrow said the issue was not about her relationship with Woody Allen

'He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set,' Miss Farrow wrote.

'Then
 he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering 
that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go
 to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.'

Farrow went on to describe how the 
award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan' would always find
 a way to touch her and do things to her she did not like, including 
sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her to get into bed with him 
and placing his head in her naked lap.

'Anger': Farrow, pictured, and Allen split after she found naked photos he took of another daughter

'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said.

What
 followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from 
one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again 
to see if she was lying.

In 
the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a 
Connecticut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there 
was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he 
was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state.

Farrow and Allen separated after Farrow 
found nude photographs that Allen had taken of Farrow's adopted daughter
 from a previous relationship, Soon-Yi Previn, when she was 20.

Allen, 78, has always denied the 
allegations of sexual abuse against Dylan. He was never charged with, or
 convicted of, a crime in this case.

Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart, said the director read the article 'and found it untrue and disgraceful'.

Allen, who has stayed largely silent throughout the recent allegations, performed at a jazz concert on Monday in Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel - where he raised eyebrows with his choice of song.

He played 'When You're Smiling' - which features in the final credits of 'Mighty Aphrodite', a film with incestuous themes, RadarOnline reported.

As he left, one guest told him to 'hang in there', to which he responded: 'I intend to. Thank you.'

Denial: Woody Allen's attorney Elkan Abramowitz told the Today show the filmmaker's adopted daughter only accused him of sexual assault because the idea was planted in her mind by her mother Mia Farrow

On Tuesday, his attorney, Elkan Abramowitz, blamed Mia Farrow for planting stories in Dylan's head.

'I think it's part of Mia Farrow's desire to hurt Woody Allen,' Abramowitz told the Today show.

'His
 reaction is one of overwhelming sadness because of what has happened to
 Dylan. She was a pawn in a huge fight between him and Mia years ago. 
The idea that she was molested was implanted in her mind by her mother.

'[Dylan]'s not lying, she truly 
believes this happened. That's what the vice of this is - when you 
implant a story in the mind of a fragile seven-year-old... it never goes
 away.'

Abramowitz added 
that the accusations were resurfacing now, 20 years on, because Allen's 
Golden Globe lifetime achievement award had 'revived the anger [Mia 
Farrow] has towards him'.

Despite Allen's vehement denial, the 
accusations have caused outrage and division among Hollywood including 
Lena Dunham, who urged her 1.3 million Twitter followers to read 
Farrow's letter.

'To share in this way is courageous, powerful and generous,' Dunham wrote

Spirited: The women of The View talked about the story - with Barbara Walters, right, defending Allen

Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have also been unwavering in their support of her.

On the night of the Golden Globes 
ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's 
alleged assault in a scathing tweet.

'Missed
 the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly 
confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?' the 
newly hired MSNBC host wrote.

But on Monday, Barbara Walters came to Allen's support on The View.

The
 84-year-old co-creator of The View opened the discussion after Whoopi 
Goldberg introduced the topic. Walters, a friend of Allen's, pointed out that the statute of 
limitations had run out.

'I have rarely seen a father as 
sensitive, as loving and as caring as Woody is and Soon-Yi to these two 
girls. I don't know about Dylan. I can only tell you what I have seen 
now,' Walters said.
