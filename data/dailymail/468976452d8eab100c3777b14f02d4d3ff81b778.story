The Montana Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the one-month-jail sentence that teacher Stacey Dean Rambold received for raping a 14-year-old girl and will now be re-sentenced for his crime.

To national outrage Rambold, 54, was handed the staggeringly light sentence because Yellowstone County District Court Judge G. Todd Baugh said that his victim was somehow complicit in the rape because she was 'in control of the situation.'

Victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending and in his verdict, Judge Baugh, who has since admitted his grave error, said that Moralez 'seemed older than her chronological age.'

In their decision, the court found that statements made by Baugh at the original sentencing in August 'reflected an improper basis for his decision and cast serious doubt on the appearance of justice.'

Rambold, who was 47 at the time of the crime will be sentenced by a new judge after Baugh's failure to re-sentence him in September.

Rambold has been free since completing his sentence last fall. Prosecutors for the state say he should serve a mandatory minimum of four years prison.

His attorneys had argued that the original sentence was appropriate.

A disciplinary complaint against Baugh from the Judicial Standards Commission is pending with the state Supreme Court. Justices say that will be dealt with separately.

In March, Rambold repeated his claim that Moralez led him on and was as much to blame for their encounter as himself.

Under state law, children younger than 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse.

'Rambold continues to perpetuate the myth that a 14-year-old girl should bear responsibility for her sexual victimization by a 47-year-old teacher,' Assistant Attorney General Tammy Plubell wrote in court filings chastizing Rambold.

'The law, though, rightly defines her as blameless.'

Rambold's attorneys have argued that the original sentence from state District Judge G. Todd Baugh was appropriate. In a brief submitted to the state's high court last month, they urged justices to reject the appeal.

Citing Moralez's statements in interviews with law enforcement recorded before her death, Rambold attorneys Jay Lansing and Nancy Schwartz said there was 'no rational basis' to conclude a 14-year-old could bear responsibility only as the offender in a rape case.

Stacey Dean Rambold was only given a one month prison sentence for his rape against a 14-year-old victim he said 'looked older than her age'

A 14-year-old victim can bear responsibility, too, the attorneys suggested.

The interviews are under court seal and have not been made public.

Lansing and Schwartz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have turned down previous interview requests.

Moralez was a freshman at Billings High School when she was raped. Rambold was her business teacher. She committed suicide in 2010, an act her mother said was driven largely by the rape.

The girl's death took away the prosecution's main witness, and Rambold initially avoided prison under a deferred-prosecution agreement that included sex-offender treatment.

He violated the agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives' children and having a sexual relationship with an adult woman, according to court documents.

That re-opened the case and led to the August sentence from Baugh of 15 years in prison with all but one month suspended. Rambold was released in September.

Baugh unsuccessfully sought to impose a longer term after coming under criticism for saying during the sentencing hearing that the victim 'appeared older than her chronological age.'

Montana's Judicial Standards Commission has asked the Supreme Court to censure Baugh for imposing an unlawful sentence and blaming the child victim.

The panel investigated the case after receiving hundreds of complaints about the judge, including from mother, Auliea Hanlon.
