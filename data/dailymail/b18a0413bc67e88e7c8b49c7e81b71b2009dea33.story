Where the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson, Terry Venables and Alan Pardew have failed, Sam Allardyce has succeeded.

It’s hard to believe Teddy Sheringham has spent the past six years out of the game. But here he is back at West Ham United, wrapped up to the nines in his training gear after leading a coaching session at chilly Chadwell Heath.

The former England striker is back in football. Not that he looks like he has ever been away.

Teddy Sheringham reveals why he decided to take time away from football following his retirement 

TEDDY on... BIG SAM

I couldn’t have asked to work with a better boss for my first real impression of what managerial life is like. He’s been very open with me and I’ve got the utmost respect for that. He’s very experienced.

TEDDY on... CARROLL

It’s not now or never for Andy. He’s getting there and he’s a still very young man in footballing terms. He has surprised me in how good his finishing is. But he’s got to take that on to the pitch. With a cool head, he’ll get goals.

TEDDY on... DOWNING

I’ve loved working with him. I can’t believe he only had one goal last year and one the previous season. He’s an outstanding talent... phenomenal. He’s got every finish in the book, so he should be scoring goals.

Sheringham still looks as fit and sharp as he did throughout the golden years of a career in which he played until 40, a record age for an outfield Premier League player. West Ham fans drool at the way Sheringham zips the ball around during pre-match warm-ups. Up in the stands the talk turns to whether he could still do a job on the pitch.

So what has kept Sheringham away so long? ‘It’s all about timing,’ he says.

‘I saw Alan [Pardew] out in Germany last summer - West Ham and Newcastle crossed paths as we were in the same tournament - and he was like, “What are you doing here?” So I said, “I don’t know, what am I doing here?”

‘Quite a few managers have tried to get me on that path of taking my badges and doing coaching. Terry Venables always told me that I need to be involved, not just for myself but for football. Sir Alex always said to me “get your badges done because you’ll love it”. 

'It was the same with Pards when he came to West Ham. My view was that I was either a player or a coach or a manager. It’s black or white for me. But the gaffer’s call in the summer was just perfect timing and the scenario was, too — on a part-time basis.’

Sheringham spends two days a week working with West Ham, three if there is a home match. And having just returned from a sun-kissed week in Dubai, it’s an arrangement that suits him to a tee.

Despite their defeat by Everton last weekend, West Ham have started this season with a bang.

They have scored twice as many goals (20) as they managed last season in the opening 12 games and sit just one point below the top four. Survival is no longer up for discussion. The talk is of Europe as they eye the ultimate send-off before moving to the Olympic Stadium.

Sheringham, 48, who had three years as a player at West Ham, refuses to take the credit, but ultimately he wants to be the man calling the shots at the top.

‘I’m loving it. Really loving it,’ he says. ‘It has been very different. I’m on the other side of the fence and it’s a big change. The situation with myself and Sam was: “Look come in two days a week and see what happens and if you don’t like it, we’ll part our ways”.

‘But if I’m going to do it, I want to be the best I can. I’m an all or nothing type of bloke. And I hope that will take me into management. That’s the way I’m feeling. I want to go full steam ahead.

‘I’m a coach at the moment but I’d like to be a manager.’

So how has he it found it working with the likes of Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing and Enner Valencia?

‘The players have been very good towards me,’ says Sheringham. ‘I’ve played here, been around the place before and scored goals. But it’s a little bit different trying to explain that to other people.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce called Sheringham in the summer to ask if he would return as a coach

‘It’s about getting to know those players. It’s not just about putting on a session. It’s about talking to the players and finding out where they are - discover their mindset - because that’s crucial. I was a little bit apprehensive about coming in and putting on my first session because I don’t know how it’s going to go.

‘They’re looking at me and probably thinking, you’re this ex-player who’s been around and knows his stuff. Well, go on then... show us what you can do. And it’s a bit like, well I’ve never put on a session before!

West Ham are currently sixth in the Premier League table with 18 points from 12 games

Sheringham believes West Ham winger Stewart Downing is an 'outstanding talent' 

‘It’s a little bit of trial and error. If you put on two or three bad sessions, they’ll soon be saying, “No thanks. I’ll go and do my shooting with someone else”. Touch wood, it has not been like that.’

Sheringham draws on the experiences of playing under George Graham, Brian Clough, Venables, Ferguson, Glenn Hoddle and Harry Redknapp.

‘Cloughie and Fergie were great, but didn’t really coach much. But then there’s George Graham. At Millwall, he would put on a shooting session and show us exactly what he wanted.

‘It was unbelievable at the time for a 19-year-old boy. I was like “Oh, wow”. Shooting, heading, volleying. He was fantastic. And you’d think, “Right, so that’s what you want me to do,” and you’d try and emulate it.

Sheringham believes Sir Alex Ferguson was the manager he played under, but 'didn't really coach much' 

Sheringham believes the way some Newcastle fans treated Pardew was 'disgusting'

‘I’ve tried to take some of that experience into it.

‘I was lucky to have so many great coaches, great managers that I worked under and at the right stage of my career as well.

‘You try and think about what would they have said to me at that particular time - what would he have done. But I’ve had a few bad ones along the way too. I’ve seen first-hand the wrong way to do things. You can’t have it all good.

Despite fans calling for him to be sacked, Pardew's side are now on a run of six successive victories

Sheringham admits that he will have to be thick-skinned if he is to take up a management role

Andy Carroll is on the cover of West Ham's programme for Saturday's game with Newcastle

‘And this is the thing with the boys at Manchester United. They worked under Sir Alex Ferguson and that’s all they know.

‘He was the best, without a doubt, as a manager. But they’ve not sampled the bad managers. They’ve not sampled the ups and downs. I’ve been in and around pretty much every scenario in football.’

Pardew’s Newcastle visit West Ham on Saturday looking for their seventh straight win — all on the back of heavy criticism from supporters who campaigned for him to be sacked.

‘Some of it was disgusting,’ says Sheringham. ‘You wouldn’t wish it upon your worst enemy.

‘It was the same for Sam with some of the stick that he’s taken. But they are thick-skinned these managers. You look at them and think, “How are you taking that?” In no other job in the world would you get people barracking in your ear.

'They’ll be trying to concentrate on the pitch but all they can hear is thousands of people all around screaming, “You’re useless”. How does that work? So you have to take your hat off and applaud them for doing a good job.’

One day people may applaud Sheringham, the manager, for doing a good job too.

The full interview with Teddy Sheringham appears in the Official West Ham United programme for the game against Newcastle. Also inside, Andy Carroll talks about how he has changed his lifestyle and Les Ferdinand looks back on his career with both clubs.
