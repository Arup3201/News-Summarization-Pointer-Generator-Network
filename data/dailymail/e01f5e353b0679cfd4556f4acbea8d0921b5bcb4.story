Principals are struggling to deal with the students and parents who are falling under the sway of radical Islam, according to a group representing educators.

The Australian Principals Federation has welcomed the Victorian government's move to introduce new measures to deal with the growing problem in schools.

A state education spokesman said the department was working closer with police and had nominated staff in regional officers to work with Victoria Police counterparts 'to provide advice and support to schools'.

The Australian Principals Federation says principals are having trouble dealing with the radicalisation of parents and students who may turn out like Abdullah Elmir

It comes after one principal told Fairfax Media of his struggles to help two children whose parents have left Australia to Syria to fight with Islamic State in the Middle East at his state-run primary school.

'We have to work extra hard to ensure students don't take up their parents extreme beliefs,' he said.

'I have them singing the national anthem with the Australian flag and say what a lucky country they live in.'

The school is made up of a lot of children from the Shiite, Alawite and Sunni Muslim communities.

Since then, there had been a rise in suspensions of students as they fought at school.

'What's happening in the Middle East does impact here - the families are divided in their beliefs,' he said.

The Australian Principals Association branch president Peter Kearney told Daily Mail Australia 'several issues' about 'social cohesion' had been raised with the group by principals.

'One thing we see is that where there are tensions in the community then there are tensions in the school,' he said.

Mr Kearney said radicalisation in students and children had been 'a battle for principals' but they were unsure about how to deal with it.

'What are the guidelines, where do you go? What do you do when children behaving extremely? It's quite complex for principals to make a decision without rules,' he said.

'Kids, for example, who come from different religious groups have different ways to wear uniform. Boys might like to have their ankles exposed deliberately. And [principals ask]: "Is that is they way we like to wear our uniform?"

'Parents like the fact that children show their strength, it's what their beliefs are, that is required for what they do for their religion. 

'We might not thing its important but it's the start of all sorts of wedges.'

The former principal's comments come after concerns grow for the vulnerability of teenagers being recruited by terror group Islamic State.

Elmir - who is known as the Ginger Jihadi - has appeared in a number of terror group recruitment video since he made his way over to Syria

Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadi - who went missing from his western Sydney home has appeared in a number of recruitment video for the extremist organisation in Syria.

Another teenager who was suspected of having ties to terrorism was Numan Haider who was shot dead by police last year after he stabbed two officers in Melbourne.

But Mr Kearney stressed this behaviour was not isolated to one religion.

'Most of the stuff schools deals with, it's confronting because of the ability to recruit other kids,' he said.

'The culture of schools is always open to challenge. The last school I was principal of had 64 nationalities.'

A Victorian Department of Education spokesman said education was key to ensure young people were not marginalised and 'embrace the values of respect, diversity and tolerance'.

'Schools, like other areas of the community, can be environments in which children and young people may become marginalised, or the victims of racial, cultural or religious intimidation or bullying,' he said.

'The department has strengthened its relationships with Victoria Police, and has nominated staff in regional offices to work with their counterparts in Victoria Police to provide advice and support to schools.

'The department has appointed one of its senior advisers to work with government and non-government schools on initiatives to promote racial and religious tolerance and social cohesion, and to identify how best the department can support these initiatives.

'The department's nominated staff in regional offices are always available to advise and support school principals who may have concerns about a student’s safety or well-being.'
