Andy Murray is prepared to forgive and forget when he faces the man who criticised his groundbreaking appointment of a female coach last summer.

The British No 1’s second-round opponent at the Australian Open will be local hope Marinko Matosevic, who expressed some fairly unreconstructed macho views when Murray teamed up with Amelie Mauresmo after the French Open.

Asked what he thought of the idea, the Australian known as ‘Mad Dog’ declared publicly what some of his peers or former players were only prepared to say in private.

‘I couldn’t do it because I don’t think that highly of the women’s game,’ he commented. ‘It’s all equal rights these days, politically correct. Someone’s got to give it a go, but it won’t be me.’

Now Murray has set up their first encounter since Matosevic brought the furies on himself. It is his reward for a sometimes laboured 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 victory over Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri.

The world No 6 does not bear a grudge after Matosevic, with whom he has always got on well, swiftly moved to make amends last year.

‘He came and spoke to me immediately about it when it was in the papers and apologised, and spoke to my mum about it and apologised, and apologised to Amelie,’ revealed Murray.

Matosevic said he didn't think highly enough of the women's game to hire a female coach after Murray appointed Amelie Mauresmo last year

‘He’s the sort of guy, he can say something and he doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad with it if that’s his opinion. If he doesn’t want to work with a female coach then that’s absolutely fine and that’s the case with many players. I’m not offended by it and I get on absolutely fine with him.’

The extrovert Matosevic, 29, let out an animalistic scream when he finally edged out Russian Alexander Kudryavtsev in a deciding fifth set, but insists he is mellowing and trying to avoid controversy. ‘I guess I’m definitely maturing in my old age, I’m a late bloomer,’ he said. ‘I guess mentally-wise I’m a late developer in that department as well.’

He described Murray’s skill levels as ‘probably second only to Roger (Federer)’ and that is why the Scot’s subtle ability to break down an opponent will probably prove too much for him when they meet.

One of the many fascinating questions to be answered this year is whether the Australian’s original take on the Mauresmo arrangement proves to be correct or if she can coax Murray back to the heights achieved with Ivan Lendl.

They have had a chance to work together in Miami and, judging by yesterday, have altered his service action with particular reference to the ball toss which was a nagging issue through 2014.

What does not appear to have changed is Murray’s tendency to show frustration and communicate angrily with himself when things are not working out, as they sometimes failed to do against Bhambri.

Murray admitted this is a natural tendency, saying: ‘When things don’t go people’s way, it’s normal. If I went to play five-a-side football with my dad’s friends and someone misplaces a pass, everyone’s reaction when they do something wrong is to want to say something.

‘It’s about making sure you aren't letting those things affect you... it’s not something that necessarily comes naturally to everyone.’

Murray feels his back is now in such good shape and he looks to be moving as well as ever. It is difficult to see Matosevic piercing his defences.

They actually met the week before last at the Hopman Cup in Perth, with no ranking points at stake, and Murray won easily.

But, as his demeanour against Bhambri sometimes showed — he needed to recover from 1-4 in the third set — the pressures are very different in a Grand Slam.
