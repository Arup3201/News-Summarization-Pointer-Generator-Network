Nico Rosberg is on pole for the Belgian Grand Prix after edging out Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton at Spa.

The championship leader was 0.228 seconds faster than the Brit as Mercedes were once again in a class of their own.

Relive all the action as it happened. 

14:08: In the meantime, I will leave you with our report from qualifying HERE.

14.01: NICO ROSBERG ON POLE FOR BELGIAN GRAND PRIX.

Lewis Hamilton has to settle for second place, Sebastian Vettel is in third.

Thumbs up for Rosberg. He is primed to extend his advantage in the drivers' championship. Make sure you join us in the race tomorrow from midday.

Hamilton with a scruffy final lap with a couple of small errors that left him 0.228 seconds behind his team-mate.

Vettel leads the rest of the field in third place, 2.1 seconds off pole.

Here are your top 10:

1. Rosberg

2. Hamilton

3. Vettel

4. Alonso

5. Ricciardo

6. Bottas

7. Magnussen

8. Raikkonen

9. Massa

10. Button 

13:52: The sun is out now again in Belgium, and that means the track will be drying all the time. Rosberg has set the initial pace on 2:05.698 on the intermediate tyres, over two seconds faster than Vettel and Alonso.

13:42: At the end of Q2, it was all plain sailing for Mercedes with Hamilton a tenth ahead of Rsoberg and then a gap of over a second to the rest of the field.

The drama occurred lower down the field when Button needed to produce a good lap lying in 11th place. The 2009 world champion did that, and knocked reigning champion Vettel into 11th. But the Red Bull driver also delivered a flying lap, and that means that Kvyat is the man who is eliminated in 11th place.

The men who are out then...

11.Kyvat

12. Vergne

13. Perez

14. Sutil

15. Grosjean 

16. Bianchi

Spray: Championship leader Nico Rosberg competes during a wet qualifying session in Belgium

13:36: Lewis Hamilton goes a second faster than anyone with a 2:07 on the intermediate tyres. Rosberg is second but a lot closer to the rest of the pack.

The rain is showing no signs of easing up as we head into the final five minutes of this session. 

13:29: It is raining again in Spa and Romain Grosjean's race engineer has just told him over team radio that the track is getting wetter. It looks like the full wets could be coming back for this session. 

Sportsmail's Jon McEvoy reports: 'Raining now, at the start of Q2. Getting in a good early lap could be key. Max Chilton, after the hoopla about whether he would drive or not – contractual problems – was eliminated in Q1, a second a half slower than his team-mate Jules Bianchi.'

13:27: Just to run through the men who are out after Q1 as we head into Q2 

17. Pastor Maldonado

18. Nico Hulkenberg

19. Max Chilton 

20. Esteban Gutierrez

21. Andre Lotterer

22. Marcus Ericsson

13:21: HULKENBURG OUT! The Force India driver exits in Q1 in 18th place.

Pastor Maldonado also doesn't make it through as he finishes 17th. 

13:17: Hamilton and Rosberg in a class of their own out in front, over a second faster than the rest of the field. Rain starting to fall again. 

Host commentator

Hamilton goes fastest with just over nine minutes remaining on 2:07.5.

The Brit is on the intermediate tyres and they look like the way to go at the moment.

Ferrari have pitted their drivers to put the inters on their cars. Alonso is 3.6 seconds off Hamilton using the full wets.

Rosberg second, two tenths behind Hamilton at the moment.

A divide in opinion at the moment among the teams. Ferrari have sent both Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen out on full wet tyres while Lotus pair Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado are both on inters.

A lot of spray visible at the moment. Leading mark is Ricciardo with a 2:10.6, one tenth ahead of Bottas.

The clock is ticking and we are underway in Q1.

A queue of cars waited at the end of the pit lane for the session to start. 

Intermediate tyres for a lot of the drivers, including Lewis Hamilton.

Right, it looks like the track is fit for action, and Q1 will be underway very shortly.

What the top teams must be careful of in this session is being caught out by a drying track that will result in some faster times towards the end of the session.

Here is an update from Jon McEvoy at Spa:

'The safety car is going round, throwing up quite a bit of water. It has stopped raining though. Christian Horner made it back to the Red Bull motorhome from Mercedes with the help of a Mercedes member of staff holding his umbrella – a kind of chauffeur service.'

It's brightening up at Spa!

After that torrential downpour, the sun is out and there is blue sky over the track at the moment.

No update yet on whether the stat of qualifying has been delayed. There is a lot of water on the track after that downpour.

'Throwing it down with rain. Team principals huddling in Mercedes after a meeting. First to run out of the building is John Booth - that's Yorkshire for you.'

These downpours are very heavy and it looks like we could have a delay to qualifying.

No word just yet, but I'll keep you informed of any announcements.

In the meantime, enjoy some more rain pictures...

And here we go. It is now raining at Spa and quite heavily as well.

Hail stones as well now, according to Sky Sports' Simon Lazenby.

Once again in Belgium, F1 rolls into town and there are more than a few anxious glances to the sky.

It's no different today. The forecast says that rain will arrive at some point during qualifying, that should spice things up nicely.

The skies are already cloudy with some dark clouds in sight.

11 races down and eight to go in this 2014 season.

It's been a two-horse race all the way with Mercedes duo Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton seconds faster than anybody else on the track.

The gap between the pair is 11 points at the moment but there is a very, very long way to go yet in the title race.

Welcome to Spa, and our coverage of the Belgian Grand Prix.

It's been a long summer break, but F1 is finally back this weekend in Belgium and all eyes are on the title battle.

Lewis Hamilton and championship leader Nico Rosberg resume their battle for the title in Spa with the German leading by 11 points.

Who will steal a march in qualifying today ahead of the race tomorrow afternoon.

All the action coming up in an hour from now.
