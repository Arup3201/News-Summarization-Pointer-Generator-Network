Henri Canning, 25, harvested hundreds of cannabis plants in his flat to fund his big day

A groom who amassed a £15,000 drug empire to pay for his wedding has been jailed after electricity engineers spotted a 'hot wire' to his factory.

Henri Canning, 25, harvested hundreds of cannabis plants in his flat to fund his big day.

But the railway worker was foiled by EDF power engineers who spotted the wire leading to his makeshift factory in Folkestone, Kent.

He was then arrested and charged with producing the class B drug.

The father-of-one was jailed for 32 months at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting the production of cannabis and illegally taking electricity.

Jailing him, Judge Heather Norton said: 'These are serious offences and you are a man of previous good character and someone who so many people speak so highly of you.

'Why you should find yourself doing these things to pay off debts, one of the reasons I am told, is because of your wedding debts.

'If that is right, then it is tragic that you should have got yourself into so much debts that the only way you thought you could pay them off was in the way you tried was running a cannabis factory.'

Jim Harvey, prosecuting, said Canning had racked up thousands of pounds worth of debt after his marriage starting his new life his wife.

He continued to rent his empty flat for three months and spent £3,000 setting up the factory to cultivated mass quantities of cannabis.

Mr Harvey told the court the newly wed father made as much as £15,000 from the sale of the drug.

The plot was only foiled when staff from EDF, who were working nearby, went to check a nearby electricity metre and found it had been tampered with.

When detectives at Kent Police raided the property they found 113 of the plants - that would have landed the crook more than £20,000.

Mr Harvey added: 'Fortunately an electrical company had been carrying out work in the area and engineers became concerned about the prodigious amounts of electricity coming from the house.

'Police officers attended the property and discovered a small cannabis factory and later officials at the power company estimated that Canning had taken more than £2,100 worth of electricity illegally.'

Niall Doherty, defending, said Canning 'deeply regrets' what he has done and has agreed to repay the electricity firm.

He said Canning faced mounting debts as a result of his wedding and 'stupidly and naively' thought growing cannabis was a way to pay 'everything off'.

As well as his custodial sentence Canning was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120.
