The U.S and Canada may have witnessed a curtain-raiser for the spectacular Eta Aquarid meteor shower.

What looked like a fireball was caught on camera racing across the sky in broad daylight across western New York and Ontario, Canada, just a day before the Eta Aquarid event takes place.

Two car dashboard-mounted cameras filmed the object, with the footage subsequently uploaded to YouTube.

Light fantastic: A police dash-cam captured what appears to be a fireball streaking across the sky above Canada

Now you see it, now you don't: The object was gone in a split second, but witnesses said its brightness rivalled that of the sun

A very bright light appears against the blue sky, then quickly vanishes.

Some people reported hearing an explosion as the ball of light streaked away from them.

The American Meteor Society is urging members of the public to submit reports of the fireball to it.

Spectacular: The Eta Aquarids, seen here over Florida Keys in 2013, takes place when the earth dissects the debris trail of Halley's Comet

Goodness gracious: The great ball of fire's trajectory, according to the American Meteor Society

Here we sort through the space rubble and explain the different sorts of rock floating around in the solar system.

ASTEROIDThese are fragments from the formation of the solar system 4.6billion years ago and can range in size from half a mile to hundreds of miles wide. They generally lurk between Mars and Jupiter.

COMETThese too are also leftovers from the
 formation of the solar system and are made up of ice, rock, dust and frozen
 gases, with the core being up to 40 miles in diameter. They can leave a 
spectacular trail that's hundreds of millions of miles long as they orbit the sun.

METEOROIDThese are the result of asteroid collisions or comets breaking up.

METEORSThese are meteoroids that burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere.

METEORITESMeteors that survive the fiery entry to earth and hit the ground.

It said that judging from initial reports, the object had a brightness rivalling that of the sun.

The Eta Aquarid meteor shower is created as the Earth passes through the debris trail of Halley’s Comet, according to Nasa, and this year it peaks between May 5 and 6.

About 30 meteors will be visible an hour in the northern hemisphere and around 60 per hour in the southern hemisphere.

Nasa explained that the objects in the debris trail are moving at around 148,000mph.

To view the Eta Aquarids, Nasa suggests finding an area well away from city or street lights, prepared with a sleeping bag, blanket or chair.

‘Lie flat on your back with your feet facing east and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible,’ the space agency advises.

‘After about 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors. Be patient - the show will last until dawn, so you have plenty of time to catch a glimpse.’

Slooh astronomer Bob Berman said: ‘What makes this shower somewhat special is that the meteors stem from the most famous comet in all of history, Comet Halley.

‘As Halley goes around the sun in its 76-year orbit, pieces of it, little chunks of ice, slough off the comet and we intersect that every year around this time, in early May.’
