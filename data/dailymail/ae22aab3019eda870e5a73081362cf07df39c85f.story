Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has said he would welcome the chance to speak to ex-manager David Moyes.

Ferdinand has been critical of of the Scot's methods at Old Trafford in his imminent autobiography but rejects the idea that Sir Alex Ferguson should be blamed for United's downfall.

The 35-year-old, who is now at QPR, said Moyes' approach last season unintentionally created a 'negative vibe' and some of United's play  was 'embarrassing'.

Moyes was relieved of his duties by Manchester United at the end of last season

Ferdinand ended his 13-year association with United in May after being allowed to leave the club 

Moyes succeeded Ferguson in the Red Devils' hotseat in the summer of 2013 but lasted just eight months.

Ferdinand has not spoken to Moyes since but asked if he would like to, the former England centre-back told CNN World Sport: 'Yes, of course. I've got nothing against him as a person.

'As I said, I'm saying that he's a gentleman, a great man. As I said, I've never had any bad words to say about him at all in that respect as a person.'

United won the Barclays Premier League in Ferguson's final season in charge but then slumped to seventh last term and failed to qualify for the Champions League.

New manager Louis van Gaal has since overseen a £150million facelift in the hope of pushing United back up the league.

But even though such a spending spree has been deemed necessary, Ferdinand resents suggestions that Ferguson allowed the squad to grow stale.

He said: 'I don't understand how people can say (that). You've got some great players throughout the squad. You win the league by 11 points. You've got to be a top team to do that.

'So he goes and then it all falls apart? So that's his fault? How can people say that?

'I don't think the buck stops with Sir Alex Ferguson at all. I think you leave and you win a trophy. There's not many better ways to go out than that.'

Ferdinand left United when his contract expired and he was released at the end of last season.

Asked if he was frustrated about how it ended, he said: 'Yes. But you can't keep looking back and thinking like that.

'I think, yes, I've had thoughts like that but at the same time it's been really nice to see a lot of the young lads getting their opportunities.'
