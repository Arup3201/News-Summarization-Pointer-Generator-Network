The App Center will feature apps that designed for PCs as well as for mobile devices such as Apple iPhones and Android smartphones. If a mobile app requires installation for the mobile device, Facebook said it will direct users to Apple's App Store or Google Inc's Play store to download the app

If Apple and Google can do it, so can social network Facebook - the site is to launch an 'app store' to showcase the games and apps that earn the site much of its revenue.

The app store will also allow developers to sell apps direct to consumers for the first time via the network.

It's the latest in a series of moves to 'spruce up' the number one social network in advance of a flotation on the stock market expected to take place later this month - and to convince investors it CAN earn more money.

Apps such as games - particularly Zynga's titles such as Cityville - are a major source of Facebook's revenue, a fact the network is keen to hammer home.

The App Center will, for the first time, allow software developers to sell apps to consumers directly on Facebook.   

'Many developers have been successful
with in-app purchases, but to support more types of apps on 
Facebook.com, we will give developers the option to offer paid apps. 
This is a simple-to-implement payment feature that lets people pay a 
flat fee to use an app on Facebook.com,' says Facebook's Developer blog.

'For the over 900 million people that use Facebook, the App Center will become the new, central place to find great apps like Draw Something, Pinterest, Spotify, Battle Pirates, Viddy, and Bubble Witch Saga,' said the site's developer blog.

The apps will be 'rated' by users, as they are on Google's Play and Apple's iTunes - which should help weed out apps that exist only to spam people via the site.

The new App Center, which Facebook said will launch in the next few weeks, comes as the company is preparing an initial public offering that would value the company between $77 billion and $96 billion.   

A key concern for investors is Facebook's slowing revenue growth, due in part to the widening trend of consumers accessing its service on smartphones, where Facebook provides limited ads.  

In an amended prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Facebook said the popularity of mobile devices has caused its number of daily users to grow faster than the number of ads it is delivering.   

Facebook makes the vast majority of its revenue from online ads, although it also collects fees when consumers purchase goods from within social apps, such as Zynga's Farmville.   

If Apple and Google can do it, so can social network Facebook - the site is to launch an 'app store' to showcase the games and apps that earn the site much of its revenue

Consumers will need to use Facebook Credits, the company's payment system, to purchase the apps and Facebook will take a 30 percent cut of the revenue as it does with in-app purchases, said Facebook spokeswoman Malorie Lucich.   

Facebook is introducing the app service to give software developers additional options, but the company expects in-app purchases to remain more prevalent on the social network, said Lucich.

Apps, ranging from social games to music services, are popular activities on Facebook, the world's No.1 online social network with roughly 900 million users. According to the company, 200 of the apps that are available on Facebook have more than 1 million users.   

The App Center will feature apps that designed for PCs as well as for mobile devices such as Apple iPhones and Android smartphones.

If a mobile app requires installation for the mobile device, Facebook said it will direct users to Apple's App Store or Google's Play store to download the app.   

Apps such as Marvel Avenger's Alliance already allow users to buy in-game items using 'Facebook Credits' - linked to a credit card

Earnings: With the IPO, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will place him in the top 30 richest people in the world while retaining stock valued at $17.6 billion

Mark Zuckerberg will become one of the worlds' richest people, worth $17.6 billion (£10.8 billion) when Facebook floats on the stock market on May 18.

Zuckerberg,
27, will be worth more than technology rivals such as Microsoft's fiery
CEO Steve Ballmer, who at 56 is twice Zuckerberg's age, according to 
official documents filed by Facebook yesterday with US financial 
regulators.

He will 
also be richer than Michael Dell, 47, and Russian steel billionaire 
Vladimir Lisin, who at 55 is also twice Zuckerberg's age.

The CEO will also maintain about 58% of the company's voting power.

Facebook has set a price range of $28
to $35 for its initial public offering of stock - potentially valuing 
Facebook at $79.3 billion, by far the biggest IPO in Silicon Valley 
history.

The IPO could raise as much as $11.8 billion in Silicon Valley's largest IPO ever.

Investors are expected to 
flock to the highly anticipated IPO, though some have voiced concerns 
about the social network's longer-term growth.

Last week, Facebook reported its first 
quarter-to-quarter revenue slide in at least two years.

Investors took it as a sign that the 
social network's sizzling growth may be cooling as it prepares to go 
public in the biggest ever Internet IPO.

'It was a faster slowdown than we would have guessed,’ said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.

‘No
matter how you slice it, for a company that is perceived as growing so 
rapidly, to slow so much on whatever basis - sequentially or annually - 
it will be somewhat concerning to investors if faced with a lofty 
valuation,’ Wieser said.

Facebook's IPO 
has been highly anticipated, not just because of how much money it will 
raise but because Facebook itself is so popular. The world's largest 
online social network has more than 900 million users worldwide.

If
the underwriters sell the extra stock reserved for overallotments, the 
IPO will value Facebook at $79.3 billion at the high end of the price 
range.

That's much 
higher than any other Internet IPO in the past, even Google Inc. in 
2004, which raised $1.9 billion. The range came in a regulatory filing 
Thursday.

After that, Facebook will go on an 
'IPO roadshow,' where executives talk to potential investors about why 
they should invest in the stock.

If all goes well, Facebook's stock is expected to price on May 17 and make its public debut on May 18.

The indicative price range, which is lower than first expected, can be 
adjusted depending on Wall Street's response.

Ticker: Listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker 'FB,' the IPO expects to raise as much as $11.8 billion after its public debut on May 18

CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who turns 28 
this month, has emerged as a wunderkind leader who's led Facebook 
through unprecedented growth from its scrappy start as a hangout for 
Harvard students.

Zuckerberg will keep tight control over the company even after the IPO.

He
will control about 58 percent of the company's voting power, through 
stocks he owns or because other shareholders have promised to vote his 
way through shares that they own.

This means he will have final say over the biggest decisions facing the company even after it goes public.

Zuckerberg will own 31.5 per cent of Facebook's outstanding stock after the IPO.
