We have all come home from a night on the town and fancied a bite to eat.

However, new research suggests that this could be more dangerous that it might appear.

A study shows that 17 million Britons have risked starting a fire by cooking while they are drunk.

In the last year 34 per cent of people risked starting a fire by cooking after consuming more than two alcoholic drinks

The researchers claim that in the last year 34 per cent of people cooked after consuming more than two alcoholic drinks.

They warn that these people risk falling asleep and leaving their oven on which could cause a fire.

And it seems that celebrity chefs who are seen glugging glasses of wine while whipping up culinary delights might be partly to blame for the trend in drunken cooking.

But it is professional workers who are the biggest offenders as they are less likely to visit a take away on their way back from a night out, and prefer to cook when they get home.

The Direct Line home insurance research suggests that this is not the only drunken pursuit that Britons engage in.

It revealed that one in ten people admit to gardening after hitting the bottle.

TV chef Keith Floyd was well known for being fond of a drink while cooking - TV chefs are being blamed for the rise in drunken cooking as they are regularly seen glugging wine while cooking

This means that some are operating potentially dangerous machinery while over the legal drink drive limit.

Paul Braithwaite, home insurance claims manager at Direct Line, said: ‘While people may think they are fine to fire up the fryer or trim the hedge after a couple of beers, they need to remember their ability to operate this equipment will be impaired after just a couple of alcoholic drinks. 

‘People are putting themselves at increased risk of injury in the kitchen, or setting their home on fire if they fall asleep with the cooker on, after consuming alcohol.’
