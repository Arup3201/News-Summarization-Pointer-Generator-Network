Royal protection officers who failed to stop naked pictures being taken of Prince Harry in Las Vegas last month cannot intrude into the private lives of royalty, Britain’s most senior policeman said today.

Metropolitan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs that police protecting high profile individuals cannot cross ‘the golden line’ by getting involved in their personal life.

He was questioned by Commons Home Affairs
Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz about the naked photographs of the 
27-year-old Prince in a hotel room, first published on a US
website.

Having fun: Britain's most senior policeman today insisted that royal protection officers cannot intrude into the private lives of royalty

Mr Hogan-Howe, 54, said today: ‘We’re already in the process of reviewing that particular incident.

‘Our role is to maintain the security of our protected individual. They have to lead a normal life and we have to strike a balance between intrusion into their life and keeping them safe.'

Days before pictures of his naked body spread across the internet, Prince Harry was photographed relaxing in a jacuzzi at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas with his best friend and his bodyguard.

On his right was his longtime companion Tom 'Skippy' Inskip, and to his left was one of his royal protection officers, who has worked with the Royal Family since 1995, laughing and joking with him.

Keeping back: Metropolitan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs that police protecting high profile individuals cannot cross 'the golden line' by getting involved in their personal life

It raised questions for the Metropolitan Police about why one of their employees, sent entirely at  taxpayers’ expense, was spotted having fun with the man he was meant to protecting.

But Mr Hogan-Howe added: ‘There is a golden line that cannot be crossed, which is getting involved in the social lives of the principals. There was nothing inappropriate and what appeared in photographs to be wrong was not as appeared.’

The embarrassment raised fears about the Prince’s protection, despite Met sources saying that there was no security breach and that officers were not there to protect his reputation.

It is believed two of Prince Harry’s most high-ranking protection officers were interviewed by bosses back in London last month after accusations that they failed to stop the naked photos being taken.

Global headlines were generated when pictures of Prince Harry frolicking in the nude with a naked woman during a holiday in the Nevada city emerged on celebrity gossip website TMZ last month.

One shot showed the Prince holding his genitals and another featured him with his bottom exposed. Only the Sun newspaper defied a request to UK newspapers not to publish the pictures, made by St James’s Palace via the Press Complaints Commission.

The newspaper watchdog has since said that it would be ‘inappropriate’ to open an investigation into the publication of the shots, because Prince Harry’s representatives had not made a complaint.

The Prince moved on from the embarrassing incident with an appearance at the London Paralympics before a military deployment to Afghanistan to fly an Apache helicopter for four months.
