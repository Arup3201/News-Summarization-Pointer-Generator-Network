Sydney's skies were full of whales, sharks, fish and other colourful characters as they flew over Sydney's famous Bondi Beach for the annual Festival of the Winds.

The festival was accompanied by warmer weather, attracting families who enjoyed the bright and colourful entertainment at Bondi Pavilion.

There was not a cloud in the sky as kite enthusiasts from around the world gathered at 11am showing off their kite-flying skills to the crowds.

Young children were full of excitement as they watched the hand-made kites of all shapes and sizes flying high in the sky. 

Organisers said the annual event was a 'huge success' as record crowds flocked to the beach pavilion in the 23C sunshine.

But the entertainment did not stop there; international food stalls, free dance workshops, children's rides, puppet shows and art exhibitions made up a full day of entertainment for the Bondi festival-goers. 

The 36th annual festival was presented by the Bondi Pavilion in association with The Australian Kiteflyers Society.
