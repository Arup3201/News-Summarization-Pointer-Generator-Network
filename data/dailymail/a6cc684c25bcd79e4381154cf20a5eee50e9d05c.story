Two teenage brothers were charged with murdering 12-year-old Autumn Pasquale after luring her into their house so they could steal parts from her BMX bicycle, authorities said today.

Autumn, whose body was found stuffed in a household recycling bin late Monday night after she vanished over the weekend, was promised parts for her bike by the two, authorities said, but the teenagers were really plotting to steal parts from her model.

The stunning development in the case came after the boys' own mother turned them in when she noticed a suspicious posting on one of her son's Facebook pages, Gloucester County prosecutor Sean Dalton said at a news conference.

The brothers, aged 15 and 17, have been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, disposing of a body, theft, as well as tampering with a body.

Mystery: The body of Autumn Pasquale, 12, was found in a recycling container on Monday; two teenagers were arrested in conjunction with her death today

Evidence: An investigator loads into a police van a BMX bicycle in Clayton, New Jersey, removed yesterday from the house where the body of Autumn Pasquale was found

The same? Authorities did not confirm the bike was the one belonging to Autumn, but it matched the description of the white BMX she was seen riding Saturday afternoon before she disappeared

Police also revealed they believe Autumn
 was killed by strangulation, and there were no signs of sexual assault.
 Dalton added Autumn, who was riding her bike at the time she 
disappeared was lured to the boys' house, where belongings including her
 bicycle were found.

Tragic end: Autumn Pasquale's body was recovered late Monday night from a recycling bin

Three teenage brothers live at the 
home, neighbouring teens told the Associated Press. Neither of the two arrested were named by Dalton.

The house was a place where teens frequently hung out and had parties, some neighbors said, and one of the brothers often bought and sold BMX bicycle parts, the teenagers said.

Autumn's body was found around 10 
p.m. Monday in the bin just blocks from her house and from Borough Hall,
 where thousands of people gathered earlier in the evening for a tearful
 candlelight vigil to pray for her safe return.

'The search for Autumn is over,' 
Dalton said Tuesday. He called Clayton a safe community but said parents
 should continue to keep close watch on their children.

An autopsy released today revealed that Autumn died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent with strangulation,' Dalton said.

Members of the town had spent long hours searching for Autumn. The girl's great-uncle, Paul Spadofora, thanked the community for its help in the search. The victim's parents did not attend the vigil.

'There's evil everywhere, even in the small town of Clayton,' Spadofora said.

Crime scene investigators arrived shortly before 9 a.m. in the neighborhood where the body was found.

an automated truck that picks them up and dumps the contents into the 
back.

Police barricaded the block, and 
friends and neighbors came by to see.

Some mothers said they were 
keeping their kids out of school for the day.

Even before the body was 
found, students reported that Spirit Week had been canceled because of 
the sorrow.

One young man rode a bike up, sat on a porch of a home and cried, then biked away.

Clayton Mayor Thomas Bianco walked to 
the scene, cried, hugged a police officer and gave a brief statement to 
the gathered reporters.

'You hear about it in other places but never think it would happen in our little town,' he said.

Howard Kowgill, 60, who lives in town 
and, like many, knows members of Autumn's family, said the discovery of 
the body changes the nature of the town.

'Until they find out who did it, you don't let your kids out,' he said.

Autumn
was reported missing from her home on Saturday evening, 
and had been the subject of a large search over the last two days until her body was found last night.

An
 autopsy to further confirm the body's identity will be conducted this 
morning by the Gloucester County Medical Examiner's office.

Coming together: Residents of Clayton take part in a candlelight vigil for Autumn on Monday night, shortly before it was announced that her body had been found

Dalton said: 'This is a very sad 
day for the Pasquale family. Our hearts go out to the family and to all 
the residents of Clayton who stood together in support of this young 
girl.'

About 200 law enforcement officials and hundreds more volunteers searched for Autumn yesterday.

Dalton yesterday said that 75 people had been interviewed in connection with what-was-then a missing person case.

'You hear about it in other places but never think it would happen in our little town.'

Just before 4pm yesterday, investigators entered a house behind a Franklin Township bar after a K-9 dog supposedly picked up a scent.

The owner told the Daily News he got a call from police at work in Mount Laurel and was asked to come home. 'They said they wanted to search my house,' the man said.

Though they left 20 minutes later with nothing, the man said he had nothing to hide but understood why he might be considered suspicious as his back window was recently broken and he is friends with a lot of young girls on Facebook because of his teenage sister.

At that point on Monday afternoon, Investigators did not 
have any suspects or a sure sense of whether Autumn was left on her own or was the victim of foul play.

Her parents - Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell - did not 
speak at the news conference. Both wept during the evening vigil.

Autumn, whose 13th birthday would have been next Monday, was last 
seen around 12.30pm on Saturday pedaling her white bicycle away from the
 Clayton home where she lives with her father, her two siblings, her 
father's girlfriend and the girlfriend's children.

A
 friend, DeAnna Edwards-McMillen, 11, said Autumn was at her 
house on Friday night and they exchanged text messages on Saturday.

She 
said she received the last one at 1.22pm and didn't believe it was 
intended for her. She said it read, 'don't be like that'.

DeAnna
 said her friend was nice and easy to be around: 'She didn't hate 
people and
 people didn't hate her.' DeAnna's mother, Debi McMillen, said that Autumn was often at their house and that she always went home before her 8pm curfew.

The
 last known communication was in a text message she sent at around 2.30pm.

Mr Dalton would not say who received 
the message or what it contained, but he added that there was nothing 
alarming or unusual about it.

It
 wasn't until about 9.30pm that she was reported missing - 90 minutes 
past her 8pm curfew, said Paul Spadofora, a family spokesman, the uncle 
of Autumn's father and the girl's godfather.
