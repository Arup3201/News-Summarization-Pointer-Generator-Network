Martin O'Neill circled the wagons around Roy Keane, insisting his assistant manager was fully entitled to speak his own mind.

‘He (Keane) has got a mind of his own, he can say what he wants,’ said O’Neill in defence of Keane, who claimed Everton were bringing pressure to bear on their Irish players around internationals.

Keane has generated more headlines than O’Neill in the past 13 months with his words and actions, but a terse O’Neill is publicly backing his No 2.

Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty

‘Every single time that you mention Roy, it either seems to be a distraction or another issue. Let me tell you straight: I’m delighted to have him,’ he said.

‘Unless what he says is absolutely and utterly in contradiction with what I am saying to you, then I do not have a problem with it. It is not an issue,’ said O’Neill.

The Irish manager said he wasn’t aware of Keane’s provocative Sunday comments, nor was he briefed about the reply by Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman, to Keane’s allegations. 

‘I’m a big fan of Roy Keane’s but he does say some stupid things,’ said Kenwright. 

‘That is just totally, totally unfair, we absolutely love our players going on international duty and we never ever get in the way of them and Roberto Martinez will be as shocked as everyone at Everton.’

O’Neill said he would reflect on the Keane and Kenwright comments before ‘taking a view’ on things. 

The Everton episode aside, O’Neill shares Keane’s stance on the Jack Grealish pursuit. 

‘I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me — but I’m not going to go and chase him (Grealish), I am not chasing him, said O’Neill.

‘The situation is there for everyone. I have spoken to Jack Grealish’s father, I have spoken to Jack Grealish and it’s really up to them.’

On Monday night, the Aston Villa winger tweeted, ‘Whatever you do whether it’s posting tweet or making a life changing decision your (sic) going to get judged, so at the end of the day do what makes you and your loved ones happy.’
