The gilded lives of premiership footballers and their families are often a source of fascination: a dizzying whirl of flash  cars, sprawling houses, and lurching from one luxury holiday or swanky nightclub to the next. 

Yet the material trappings of success mean refreshingly little to  West Bromwich Albion defender Steven Reid.

While many in his position may lavish their children with the sort of lifestyle few can imagine, he is simply concerned with helping his son Harry to hold a pen and draw.

The four-year-old has the sight condition nystagmus, which causes the eyeballs to move uncontrollably – often described as a wobble or flicker. It results in a range of problems with vision, balance and co-ordination, depending on the severity.

Those with nystagmus may have trouble negotiating uneven ground or stairs as their depth of perception can be impaired.

Children may need extra time for reading and exams to allow their eyes to focus. And if you’re dining with a sufferer, it will probably take them longer to peruse a menu.

Steven knows his son will never follow him into elite sports, or even hold a driving licence.

Yet he and his wife Kathleen, 31, are absolutely determined that the condition will never stop Harry from being a success.

‘Although Harry’s eyes aren’t the same as other children’s, he doesn’t need to wear glasses and is doing  all the things he should at his age,’ says proud father Steven, who recently became patron of the charity Nystagmus Network.

‘He’s inquisitive and he loves to draw pictures and read books, both of which encourage his eyes to focus. He can hold a pen nicely and writes really well.’

Like all new parents, he and Kathleen were besotted with Harry the moment he was born in April 2009. But one thing concerned them – when Harry tentatively opened his eyes for the first time, his eyeballs wobbled constantly from side to side.

‘The midwife and health visitor told us he was probably just learning to focus and not to worry,’ says Steven, who was playing for Blackburn Rovers at the time. ‘But when Kathleen took him for his three-month check-up, she saw a different health visitor who picked up on it straight away and asked if Harry had nystagmus.’

Steven was in Austria for pre-season 
training but flew home immediately to be with Kathleen while Harry had 
more tests with an ophthalmologist in Manchester.

Like many of us, the couple had never 
heard of the condition before then. Yet nystagmus is common  – it is 
estimated it affects up to  125,000 Britons.

Typically, children are born with the 
condition, although adults can also develop it due to injury or  
illness. It is incurable, and varies  in how much visual impairment  it 
causes, but usually doesn’t get worse after childhood. Sight will be 
blurred, with poor distance vision.

Historically, those with nystagmus – and, for that matter, most other serious visual impairments – were excluded socially.

Statistics provided by the Royal 
National Institute for the Blind reveal that in 2004, nine out of ten 
employers rated blind and partially sighted people as either ‘difficult’
 or ‘impossible’ to employ.

A study two years later concluded 
that nearly half of blind and partially sighted people felt ‘moderately’
 or ‘completely’ cut off from people and things around them.

Another report in 2012 showed that 
two-thirds of working-age people with sight problems experience 
‘restriction in being able to access and fully participate in 
employment’.

Such statistics make grim reading. 
But they disguise the fact that a major sea change has taken place  in 
recent decades, as Steve McKay, trustee of Nystagmus Network and himself
 a sufferer, has found.

‘As a child, I was sent to a special 
school for partially sighted kids, which gave out the message that we 
wouldn’t be able to achieve the same things in life as those without 
sight problems,’ he says.

‘That changed in the 1980s when it was
 realised that, with the right practical support, children with 
nystagmus could thrive in mainstream schools and should be given the 
chance to do so.

‘Now that diagnosis frequently happens in
 infancy and parents  are provided with support for  their children, we 
see countless sufferers go on to achieve university degrees and 
professional careers  in the likes of banking and the  civil service.’

Nystagmus is a complex condition with numerous variants, though essentially there are two types.

It can be present from birth or acquired later as a result of a  head injury, stroke or brain tumour. It also commonly occurs in people with albinism.

Experts think the involuntary movement of the eyeball occurs because the sensors in the  brain that control eye movements are malfunctioning.

Many patients will have impaired vision requiring glasses or contact lenses – although these won’t correct the blurring that nystagmus causes.

Those with severe  problems will need to register as partially sighted or blind, and many will never be able to drive

Patients may benefit from medication. The epilepsy drug Gabapentin and the neuroprotective drug memantine can help reduce eye movement, but they don’t work for everyone.

Surgery works well and  involves weakening two of the eye muscles by moving them further back on the eye, while shortening the two opposite muscles to strengthen them.

A newer operation removes and reattaches extraocular muscles –each eye has six extraocular muscles which work to move the eyes in different directions of gaze.

One of the experts Steven Reid’s son saw recently is Irene Gottlob, Professor of Ophthalmology at Leicester University and a consultant at Leicester Royal Infirmary. She agrees that optimism is key and that it’s highly unlikely Harry’s condition will worsen as he gets older.

‘On the contrary,’ she says. ‘In babies the eyes move wildly at first, but this calms down in the first two years as they learn to control and focus their eyes, just as in Harry’s case.

The condition should settle down further between now and his teenage years and is unlikely to deteriorate after that. Children with the condition should be encouraged to live as normal a life as possible.

‘In most patients their nystagmus is “quietest” when they look in a certain direction. This is the position at which it’s easiest for them to see well. If the nystagmus is quietest to the right, the patient will naturally turn their head to the left so they can turn their eyes to the right where their vision is best.’

Steven and Kathleen have worked hard to dramatically improve Harry’s condition.

‘Under the guidance of our consultant, we did daily exercise sessions at home for the first two years of Harry’s life using special light cubes in a darkened room to encourage his eyes to focus and track the light,’ Steven explains.

‘Before that, if we moved a toy in front of him or waved our hands he didn’t respond. But we noticed a big improvement quite quickly.’

Harry has been going to nursery at the school where his big sister Isla, six, is a pupil, and he will start reception class there next month.

‘As a parent, the one word you don’t want to hear is that your child is coping at school,’ Steven continues. ‘Coping isn’t good enough – you want them to thrive.

‘It’s simple things that will make a huge difference to Harry’s confidence and development at school, such as having a coat peg at a height he can focus on, and a seat that affords him a good view of the teacher and the board – all of which we’ve put in place with the school.

‘Our greatest hope is that Harry can achieve his maximum potential in whatever it is that interests him or he is good at, and that he develops into a happy and confident young man.

'My biggest concern is that he doesn’t suffer socially because of his constant eye wobble. Kids can be very cruel if they spot that there’s something different about another child.’

For Harry, it’s now a case of having check-ups every three months and doing the things that most other little boys love to do, such as spending the summer holidays enjoying rough and tumble and a game of football in the garden with his dad.
