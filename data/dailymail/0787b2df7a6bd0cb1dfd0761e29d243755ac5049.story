Stella McCartney never has a problem filling her front row. Her shows are easily some of the most hotly anticipated over the fashion week period.

In fact her shows have become so exclusive and well respected that the 42-year-old British designer has taken to presenting her collections at Paris Fashion Week rather than in her home town of London.

And yet despite her relocation fans of the brand are still prepared to travel far and wide in order to catch a glimpse of her sought-after SS15 creations with today's front row including Coco Rocha, Bar Refaeli, Salma Hayak and of course, the illusive American Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

Cara Delevingne appeared more sophisticated than ever on today's Stella McCartney catwalk

Loyal fans of Stella's are sure not to be disappointed with her latest line as today's models sauntered down the runway in a collection that stayed true to the designer's relaxed yet elegant style.

Models wore lose-fitting dresses in elegant silks. The theme for the collection was clearly oversized as billowing shirts and parachute trousers proved that bigger is better.

Other, more feminine pieces included sheer slips printed with intricate patterns and decorated with structured embroidery giving the dresses body and shape.

Fans of the brand can rejoice as the 42-year-old designer presented her usual relaxed designs

Oversized outlines and muted tones were on the menu at the show in Paris this morning

Stella embraced the much appreciated SS15 trend of flat shoes on her catwalk today

The designer hasn't completely forgotten her British style routes as she gave a nod to the bare nipple trend that consumed the catwalks of London Fashion Week.

Naked breasts appeared across the catwalks of Christopher Kane,  Burberry and Erdem during the London shows and they were seen again today peeping from under the delicate slips and tartan silk dresses.

As well as following the trend for exposed chests, Stella embraced the (much appreciated) fashion for flat shoes with models taking to the runway in various leather sandals, fastened with leather thongs snaking up their ankles. 

As well as flat shoes, Stella also seemed to give a nod towards the bare breast trend that was seen across the catwalks of London Fashion Week

Cara seemed on her best behaviour today (right) following last season where she caused quite a stir (left) when she led models astray by skipping down the catwalk

Although the collection seemed to be consistent with her previous collections with her AW14 line featuring the similar shapes to today's offerings, there was one element to the show that differed greatly from last season and that was Cara Delevingne.

Last season saw the 22-year-old model causing a stir during Stella's catwalk when she skipped down the runway leading other's astray as she closed the show, however today she appeared to be on her very best behaviour.

Cara appeared on the catwalk looking more serious and sophisticated than ever in palette of black and dark grey as she wore an oversized embellished coat and lace shorts.

Her sleeked back hair and solemn expression provided a complete turn-around from the previous season that saw the usually goofy Cara taking centre stage.

It appears that the 22-year-old is growing up in the world of fashion and what better place to do it than on the runway of one of the world's most sophisticated designers. 

The illusive American Vogue Editor, Anna Wintour refused to miss this morning's catwalk
