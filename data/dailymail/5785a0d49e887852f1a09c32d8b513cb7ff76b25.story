A timelapse showing the first design changes to an EasyJet aircraft since 1998 has been released to celebrate the company's 20th year of flying.

There are two main design changes. EasyJet's trademark orange has been extended from the tail fin on to the fuselage to create a larger space for the easyJet logo which is 15 per cent bigger than before. 

Secondly, an orange stripe reflecting the design language of easyJet's advertising has been introduced on to the fuselage.

It's the first easyJet re-design since 1998 as the company moves into its 20th year of flying

This enables the easyJet logo to be reversed out of that colour - in accordance with brand guidelines - and to give the plane a sleek, more modern look.‎ 

Finally, the '.com' has been dropped.

Peter Duffy, easyJet's commercial director, said: 'EasyJet's aircraft livery is one of the most recognised in aviation. 

'As we approach our 20th birthday in November, we felt a refreshed livery would complement the many changes already made to easyJet including allocated seating, transparent prices, flexible tickets and our award winning mobile app.'

The airline currently has a fleet of 226 Aircraft – a mixture of A319s and A320s. The new livery will feature on all new easyJet aircraft deliveries from April 2015. 

EasyJet has 197 Airbus A320 aircraft on order, the majority of which will replace older A319 aircraft currently in the fleet.

In addition, younger planes in easyJet's fleet will have the new livery applied when they ‎are scheduled to be repainted, typically every six years. 

Taken together this means 29 aircraft will be flying with the new look by the end of 2015 and 50 per cent of the fleet will sport the new livery by the end of 2017.

A specialist team is needed to repaint an aircraft which takes around seven days on average.

During easyJet's 19 year history there have been only two aircraft styles. The first, seen in 1995 on easyJet's first aircraft, was different to anything else flying as it advertised the booking number along the fuselage in giant lettering. 

Imagine if all planes looked like this? Thankfully this is only half-way through the design process

The final design was selected by a poll of 4,000 members of easyJet staff

The second, which entered service in 1998, displayed easyJet.com across the fuselage which reflected the important move the airline made to online booking. 

Alex Wood at Holmes Wood design agency who worked with easyJet's in house engineering team on the new livery said: 'We have spent a lot of time getting to know the personality and attitude of the easyJet brand and this new livery design was a direct translation of that. 

'EasyJet's recent brand update reflected their growth from low cost airline to one of Europe's largest carriers and with this came a new attitude and a new confidence - one that wasn't reflected in their current livery. 

EasyJet's trademark orange has been extended from the tail fin on to the fuselage to create a larger space for the company logo

Out with the old and in with the new! This design will slowly disappear from the easyJet fleet

'This new livery is a carefully considered design evolution that is both confident and fresh and we feel it reflects easyJet's ethos of modern simplicity. '

Andreas Ossenkopf, head of aviation at Mankiewicz, who provide the coatings for the aircraft added: 'Mankiewicz is very proud to be the chosen coatings supplier to easyJet. 

'We take great pride in the manufacture and supply of the most high quality and innovative Aerospace Coatings. EasyJet and Mankiewicz have the same philosophy to combine quality with efficiency and we are delighted to support the high quality image of easyJet.'
