Two pilots have surpassed the world distance record for a flight in a helium balloon after crossing the Pacific Ocean, according to their team.

American Troy Bradley and Russia's Leonid Tiukhtyaev have flown more than 5,260 miles (8,467km) since leaving Saga, Japan last Sunday.

They are now expected to arrive somewhere in Baja California, Mexico, tomorrow after unexpected weather forced them to change course from their original landing zone in the US.

Troy Bradley of New Mexico and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia have flown more than 5,260 miles (8,467km) since leaving Japan last Sunday.

Dubbed the 'Two Eagles', the pair rocketed past the distance record of 5,209 miles (8,383 km) for human flight in a gas balloon on Thursday, which had been set on the only previous manned trans-Pacific flight, in 1981.

When they eclipsed the distance record, a round of applause broke out in the mission control room at the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum in New Mexico with people posing for pictures with the mile counter. 

Art Lloyd Jr, a mission support control worker at the site, said: 'We're really excited and just now concentrating on getting them to a nice safe landing.'

To set new distance and durations records the team needed to beat the existing records by one per cent.

Yesterday the Two Eagles team tweeted: ' The pilots have just surpassed the distance needed to set a new record. 5261 miles or 8467 km.'

'We're not taking any time to celebrate,' Steve Shope, head of mission control, told My Fox Atlanta. 'We have a lot of work we have to do, and we're just taking this flight one hour at a time.'

The pilots are also trying to break the flight duration record of 137 hours, five minutes and 50 seconds, set in 1978 by a team of three pilots in Double Eagle II- the first to cross the Atlantic by helium balloon.

In 1981, the Double Eagle V, manned by several members of the same team, was also the first gas balloon to successfully cross the Pacific Ocean and set the record for  distance.

Bradley and Tiukhtyaev, who named their balloon in honour of the the Double Eagle team, should pass the existing record at about 3.50pm GMT after staying aloft for about 138 hours and 45 minutes.

The balloon, which relies solely on an enclosed chamber of helium gas for lift, is different from hot air balloons and so-called Roziere balloons, which rely on both hot air and lighter-than-air gas.

The pair, who have been equipped with cold weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater, are suspended beneath the balloon in a tiny, cramped  capsule

The huge helium-filled envelope, made of Kevlar and carbon-fibre, carries the team in a tiny capsule which sits beneath and is designed to stay aloft for up to 10 days.

Lloyd said the cramped conditions of the capsule has not affected the pilots, who have subsisted on a diet that includes fresh fruit, freeze-dried hikers' meals, beef jerky and the occasional hot meal from a small stove. They are equipped with cold-weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater.

The team says the very last task will be a safe landing since there's no certainty about where the balloon will touch down although they estimate the balloon will land in Baja California, Mexico.

A network of balloonists has been established across the US and in southern Canada who can serve as chase crews, those who are on the ground to help with tethering the capsule and rounding up the balloon's envelope as it deflates.

The volunteers are ready to travel within a 200-mile radius once the landing spot becomes clear.

Their records must be officially certified by the National Aeronautic Association and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, which can take months.
