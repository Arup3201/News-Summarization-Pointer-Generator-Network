A chip shop in the French skiing village of Val d'Isere has been forced to shut down after the former chairman of L'Oreal  complained about the 'nauseating smell' of chips wafting up his luxury lodge.

Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones - a Welsh-born Oxford graduate who stepped down as head of the cosmetics giant in 2006 - had demanded the eatery close because it was an 'olfactory nuisance'.

The multimillionaire - who received an £83million pay-off upon leaving L'Oreal - said the smell of the mobile snack stall represented 'an abnormal disturbance' to his life in Val d'Isere, adding that he felt it had also decreased the value of his luxury ski lodge.

Now a French court has demanded owner Valerie Maerten close the stall, despite her lawyer having argued that his client's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman's 'precious nostrils' over the course of seven years of legal wranglings.

Sir Lindsay was finally successful in having the chip shop closed today, having previously launched six other legal cases demanding that it cease operating. 

When the legal action was launched six years ago, he and three wealthy neighbours demanded damages for a decrease in the value of their homes.

His lawsuit argues that the stall, which is extremely popular with skiers who buy chips there throughout the day, produces 'a very important olfactory nuisance due to the cooking and frying odours that rise up into their flats and on to their balconies'. 

What's more, it adds, the stall spoils the 'view and exceptional tranquility' of the apartment, as there are 'numerous chairs… multi-coloured parasols, dustbins and vehicles' in front of it, the paper said.

However, Ms Maerten's lawyer, Maitre Francois Bern, retorted that multi-millionaire Sir Lindsay, whose former company makes world-famous scents, is engaging in 'judicial harassment' to protect nostrils accustomed only to inhaling fine aromas.

During the trial he added: 'This is a lawsuit brought by rich people who live in silk and comfort, who only inhale perfume and who want to stop this lady from living.'

Prestigious: Val d'Isere - the French Alps resort where the chip shop is based - attracts a well-heeled crowd

Responding to the decision, Ms Maerten told WWD: 'I don’t know whether I will appeal the decision. This has been going on since 2008. I am financially and physically exhausted.'

'There’s been seven rulings, and they lost the first six, but not the last one,' she said, adding that the ruling has left her unemployed, although she confirmed that she has been given until the end of the current winter skiing system to wrap up the business.

But she said that once the chip shop closes, it will be demolished within days. 

When the matter went to court in 2012, Ms Maertens said: 'I'm angry and I feel persecuted. For rich people, it's certain that a chip stall in front of them is going to be annoying but us, we have to work for a living.

'They complain about the noise and the smell of chips, but if you want peace and quiet, you don't buy an apartment at the foot of the slopes.'

When Sir Lindsay took over L'Oreal's in the mid-1980s, annual sales were $3.7 billion, and when he stood down they were $14.5 billion. Much of the success was based on brilliant marketing, including slogans like 'Because You're Worth it'.

As well as skiing, Sir Lindsay, who is now 68, is passionate about numerous sports including motor racing and sailing. 

He was knighted in 2005.
