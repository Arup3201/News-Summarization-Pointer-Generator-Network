Mario Gotze knows how to celebrate being a World Cup hero in style, as the Germany midfielder relaxed with friends and lingerie model girlfriend Ann-Kathrin Brommel in Ibiza.

Less than a week after scoring in extra time to seal a 1-0 win over Argentina in the final, Gotze found himself in some very different surroundings to that of the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.

The 22-year-old was spotted putting his £240,000 World Cup winnings to use by taking in the sun with Brommel and Co on a lavish boat - and really, who could blame the Bayern Munich star?

Last Sunday, Gotze came
 on in place of Miroslav Klose minutes from the end of the 
regulation 90, and made himself the hero that Lionel Messi couldn't.

The
 substitute was cool enough to put the ball past goalkeeper Sergio Romero to earn the 1-0
 win in the 113th minute, and save the nail-biting scenario of a penalty shootout.

His girlfriend, Brommel, was by his side there, too, taking to the pitch to give her man a kiss after he won the World Cup.
