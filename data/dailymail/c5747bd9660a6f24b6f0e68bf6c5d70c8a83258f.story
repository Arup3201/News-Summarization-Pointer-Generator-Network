Support: MP Stella Creasy has been one of the most vociferous critics of payday loans

MPs and experts have hit out at a promised crackdown on payday loan firms after it failed to cap extortionate interest rates.

The new government watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, yesterday announced controls to tackle irresponsible lending and bully boy tactics.

They will include mandatory ‘affordability checks’ and limits on how many times the lenders can raid the bank accounts of defaulting customers.

But critics said the FCA should have announced a cap on interest rates, which can top 5,800 per cent, or even an outright ban on the industry.

One MP who has campaigned vociferously on the issue, Stella Creasy, warned that concerns over payday loans could turn into a scandal to match the mis-selling of payment protection insurance unless more urgent action is taken.

There were hopes that the new FCA, which takes over regulation for consumer credit from the Office for Fair Trading in April next year, would have used its stronger powers to impose tougher controls on loan sharks.

Payday lenders have flourished on the back of a cost of living crisis by offering expensive short-term loans to millions.

The industry has grown from virtually nothing five years ago to lending more than £2billion a year, despite the extortionate interest rates involved.

Top lender: Caps would have applied to the likes of market leader Wonga.com which has faced fierce criticism in the past

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has condemned the damaging impact of companies such as market leader Wonga.com.

A study published by the Government yesterday revealed that the lenders have failed to abide by promises to treat customers fairly.

One in five borrowers reported that when they took out an initial loan their lender did not ask about their finances to make sure they could afford repayments.

Nearly one in four came under pressure to extend their loan, which can dramatically increase the cost, while half said lenders did not explain the risks.

Borrowers are required to fill out a Continuous Payment Authority form, which allows the lender to effectively raid their account to grab repayments.

Nearly one in three customers reported that the CPA system was not clearly explained, while 60 per cent were not told how to cancel CPA.

The new regime, which does not come into effect until after April next year, will make affordability checks on borrowers mandatory and limit the number of loan roll-overs to two.

It will also restrict the number of times lenders can use the CPA system to tap into a customer’s account to two.

Miss Creasy said the new rules should have included a cap on interest rates. Caps have been imposed in Australia, Japan, and several European countries, while most states in the US have effectively banned payday lenders.

Miss Creasy said: ‘The reason people get into problems is because of the cost of this credit and what that does to people who are already struggling.

‘The evidence from other countries is that capping works. We see lower levels of personal debt and lower levels of illegal lending.

‘People are lying awake at night panicking about how they pay the escalating cost of these debts.’

She
 likened the scale of the problem to the mis-selling of PPI by the big 
banks, when billions of pounds worth of useless insurance policies were 
sold.

‘If we don’t act now to change this, this is going to be the next PPI scandal – I am convinced of it,’ she said.

Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, said: ‘The regulations do not address the  usurious rates of interest charged. Nor do they ask whether the industry should exist at all.’

However, the chief of the new FCA, Martin Wheatley, insisted the firms do provide a useful service. ‘Many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch, so we don’t want to stop that happening,’ he said.

But, he warned: ‘This type of credit must only be offered to those that can afford it.’

The Consumer Finance Association, which represents the interests of payday loan businesses, said a cap on interest would lead to more illegal lending.
