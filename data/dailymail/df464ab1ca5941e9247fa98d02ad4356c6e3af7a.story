China and America's defense chiefs faced off over a territorial dispute about islands in the East China Sea, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wagging his finger at the Chinese and telling them that they don't have the right to unilaterally establish an air defense zone over the islands.

And he said on Tuesday that the U.S will protect Japan in a dispute with China, as laid out in U.S. treaty obligations.

Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan said his country will not take the initiative to stir up troubles with Japan, but Beijing is ready to use its military if needed to safeguard its territory. And he warned that the U.S. must ‘stay vigilant’ against Japan's actions and ‘not be permissive and supportive’ of Tokyo.

The U.S. has criticized Beijing's 
recent declaration of an air defense zone over a large swath of the East
 China Sea, including disputed islands controlled by Japan.

In
 their remarks, the two men aired their countries' well-known positions 
about the territorial disputes, although doing it for the first time in 
China, shoulder to shoulder after nearly two hours of meetings here.

‘Every
 nation has a right to establish an air defense zone, but not a right to
 do it unilaterally with no collaboration, no consultation. That adds to
 tensions, misunderstandings, and could eventually add to, and 
eventually get to dangerous conflict,’ said Hagel, poking his figure 
toward the television cameras and photographers at the back of the room,
 as shutters clicked.

For 
his part, Chang said China stands ready to resolve the disputes 
diplomatically. But he made it clear that China is always ready to 
respond to threats.

On the 
issue of territorial sovereignty, Chang said, ‘we will make no 
compromise, no concession, no trading, not even a tiny ... violation is 
allowed.’

On a broader 
scale, the meeting focused on how the U.S. and China can build stronger 
ties, in the wake of years of frosty relations over Beijing's military 
buildup, persistent cyberattacks against U.S. government agencies and 
private industry, and aggressive Chinese territorial claims in the East 
China Sea.

There are eight disputed islands altogether lying around 120 miles northeast of Taiwan, 200 miles east of China and 450 miles from mainland Japan, though they are only 200 miles from the Japanese island of Okinawa.

In Chinese they are known as the Diaoyu and Japan calls them the Senkaku islands.

They are significant because they lie near undersea oil and gas reserves, rich fishing waters and punctuate strategically important shipping lanes.

China says they have been part of its territory since 1534, but they were officially assimilated into Japan in 1895 after it surveyed them and established that they were uninhabited.

In 1951, under the terms of the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan relinquished several territories, including Taiwan - but the Senkaku islands moved to U.S control.

It was only a temporary arrangement, though, with Japan taking ownership once more in 1971.

China, however, says that the Treaty of San Francisco should have returned the islands to its territory.

Japan hit back, saying that China didn't make any complaints at the time and that protests only began - from Taiwan, too - once oil reserves were discovered nearby in the early 1970s.

It also disputes that the islands were ever part of China's official territory.

The biggest island measures just 1.66 square miles - and the smallest is really just a big rock.

Beijing's recent
 declaration of an air defense zone over a large swath of the East China
 Sea, including disputed islands controlled by Japan has raised 
complaints from the U.S., deepening concerns that it could spark a 
confrontation.

Washington 
has refused to recognize the zone or follow China's demands that its 
aircraft file flight plans with Beijing's Defense Ministry and heed 
Chinese instructions. China has warned of unspecified retaliatory 
measures against aircraft that do not comply, but has so far taken no 
action.

He also said the 
U.S. and China must be more open with each other about their cyber 
capabilities, saying that greater openness ‘reduces the risk that 
misunderstanding and misperception could lead to miscalculation.’

Hagel
 pointed to the ongoing threat from North Korea, which recently 
threatened additional missile and nuclear tests. And he said the U.S. 
and China have a shared interest ‘in achieving a verifiable, 
irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.’

In
 recent weeks the North has conducted a series of rocket and ballistic 
missile launches that are considered acts of protest against annual 
ongoing springtime military exercises by Seoul and Washington. North 
Korea says the exercises are rehearsals for invasion.

‘Our
 vision is a future where our militaries can work closely together on a 
range of challenges, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
 missions. However, to reach this objective, we must be candid about 
issues where we disagree,’ Hagel said.

Hagel also said the two countries have agreed to conduct a joint military medical exercise, although not date was set.

The islands lie closer to China than Japan, but both countries have claimed them

And
 he said they will set up new formal procedures that will allow their 
armies to better communicate and also set up an Asia-Pacific Security 
Dialogue between the assistant defense secretary for the Asia Pacific 
and China's director of the Ministry of National Defense Foreign Affairs
 Office so they also can more easily exchange views.

The
 United States' campaign to encourage China to be more open about its 
military growth and intentions got a symbolic boost Monday as Hagel got a
 rare tour of the country's first aircraft carrier, but efforts to get 
the Asian giant to be more transparent about cyberattacks and other 
defense operations has been less successful.

In
 a speech planned for later Tuesday, Hagel will point to cybersecurity 
as an area where the U.S. wants the Chinese to be more transparent, said
 a senior U.S. official, who was not authorized to talk publicly by name
 about the speech so spoke on condition of anonymity.

Hagel
 arrived in Beijing after a stop in Japan, where he told reporters that 
China must be more open about its military buildup and better respect 
its neighbors - a pointed allusion to the territorial disputes.

During
 unusually forceful remarks during his stop in Japan, Hagel drew a 
direct line between Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and 
the ongoing territorial disputes between China, Japan and others over 
remote islands in the East China Sea.

Calling
 China a great power, he added that ‘with this power comes new and wider
 responsibilities as to how you use that power, how you employ that 
military power.’
