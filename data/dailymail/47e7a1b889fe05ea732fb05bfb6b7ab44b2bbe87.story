Jeremy Mathieu has lifted the lid on the row between Lionel Messi and coach Luis Enrique at Barcelona.

In a turbulent week in Catalonia, Messi seemed to agitate for a move away from the Spanish side, with the fuss he caused eventually resulting in president Josep Maria Bartomeu calling the club elections a year early.

Following that controversy, Barcelona have been on a strong run of form, beating champions Atletico Madrid three times.

The 31-year-old, in action for Barcelona against Elche, says the argument was resolved immediately after

After Wednesday night's 3-2 Copa del Rey quarter-final victory over Diego Simeone's side, Mathieu spoke to French radio station RMC and explained how the row started.

He said: 'It happened when we returned from holidays. Suddenly, because of a foul that didn't get called [in training], Leo threw a tantrum. There was some friction, some things were said.

'Afterwards, the coach spoke to him in the dressing room and that was that. It happens at every club, but because this is Barcelona it's big news. And that's the problem.'

While Mathieu claims the issue ends there, the Spanish press reported several other points of tension between Messi and the coach.

Speculation fuelled that Messi could be on the move after he then followed Chelsea's Instagram account

Barcelona-based newspaper Sport reported that Messi was angered by Enrique on the day the Asturian coach arrived at the club, declaring that he was the team leader.

He was also upset by the club firing kitman Txema Corbella, a great ally of the players, while two other companions, Cesc Fabregas and Jose Manuel Pinto had already left in the summer.

After the row, which Mathieu claims was sparked by that incident in training, Messi was dropped by Enrique for the clash against David Moyes's Real Sociedad, which Barcelona lost 1-0.

Messi skipped the club's open training session the day afterwards and all hell broke loose, with the Barcelona No 10 following Chelsea on Instagram to add to the confusion.Â
