Film star Keira Knightley admits she can't quite believe how well West Ham have done this season.

Knightley is a lifelong Hammers fan and shared her love for the east London side with US chat show host Seth Meyers - also a West Ham fan - last week.

Speaking On Late Night With Seth Meyers she said: 'I should just say we are not the sort of team who win very often! I'm really glad you (Meyers) picked West Ham.

'They're having an amazing time this season though. I'm almost watching with my hands over my eyes because I fear it's not going to last, but maybe it will last?!'

Knightley, who features in newly released film The Imitation Game, admitted she wasn't surprised that West Ham have struggled over the years, considering one iconic song all the Hammers fans resonate with, which effectively crushes your dreams. 

'The song that is played before the game is great. You just have all the crowd blowing bubbles - the song's called I'm forever blowing bubbles. 

'The problem I have with it though is that the song is really sad!

'The song is about not winning and in fact your dreams fading and dying the whole time, so in reality it's not a surprise we lose all the time!'

Host Meyers also expressed his love for Sam Allardyce's side revealing just how he got into following the Hammers.

He said: 'I was in London one time and wanted to go to a Premier League game so I went to a ticket agent and had the option of going to Arsenal, Charlton and West Ham. 

'I thought that this was the only time in my life that I was going to go to East London so why not?'
