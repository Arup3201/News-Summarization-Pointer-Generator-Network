A gypsy family squatting in a Premier League football team's car park has cost taxpayers £120,000 after the local council agreed to build them a toilet block and hire a liaison officer.

The family-of-five moved their two caravans into the car park used by Swansea City for big matches seven years ago and have refused to budge.

They have set up picket fences and even scrawled a Keep Out warning on a large boulder placed outside the site.

Expensive: Taxpayers have been forced to spend £120,000 on 
services for a single gypsy family who set up an illegal site in Premier
League side Swansea City's car park

Now the cash-strapped local council 
is being forced to pay £90,000 for a toilet block next to their caravans, plus an additional £30,000-a-year for a traveller liaison officer.

Since March more than £3,000 of taxpayers’ cash has also been spent cleaning human excrement off the land.

Neighbours living near the car park next to the club's Liberty Stadium are furious at the 'waste of money' just for one family.

Father-of-three Peter Jones, 42, said: 'This is the Liberty Stadium - but it is the gypsies who are taking a liberty with our money.

'It is just ridiculous that the 
council is being forced to fork out all this money just because these 
people won’t get their caravans out of the car park.'

Traveller Kieran Joyce and his family moved into the car park seven years ago.

In 2009, the Joyce family won a court battle for the right to stay on the land while the council found a permanent site.

Swansea Council was contacted by Children’s Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler after receiving a letter from one of the traveller children - about the lack of toilets.

He instructed the authority to build toilets on the site at a cost of £90,000.But local people say the car park in now a 'filthy no-go zone'.

Councillor Dennis James said: 'A lot of people are afraid of what happened in Essex at Dale Farm. People are saying if they see this site, the Essex travellers could come here.

'There is excrement everywhere. This was a lovely area for walking but people won’t walk there now.'

The blitz unearthed 54 tonnes of waste - more than four tonnes of recycled material and 106 tyres. The clean-up cost a further £6,100.

A council spokesman confirmed it was installing the toilet block and appointed the traveller liaison officer to help tackle the problems.

He said: 'We are in the process of arranging the installation of amenities such as toilets and running water for one family.

'We hope to complete this work by the end of 2011.

'The site has been subject to continued fly-tipping which is blighting the area and requires clearance at a cost to the council.

'Our aim is to clear the site, make it secure and enable the park and ride site to be reopened.'

Traveller Mr Joyce was unavailable for comment at the car park.
