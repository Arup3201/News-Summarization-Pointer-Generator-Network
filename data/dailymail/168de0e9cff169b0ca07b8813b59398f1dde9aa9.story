A woman has died and six other people have been injured, one critically, when a tourist bus left Victoria's Great Ocean Road and plunged down a ravine.

The bus carrying Korean tourists came to a stop at the bottom of a 20-metre gap.

The woman, a passenger, died at the crash site at Princetown.

'We believe that most of the patients are Korean nationals. They were on a sightseeing tour on The Great Ocean Road,' Ambulance Victoria spokesman Paul Holman told Fairfax Radio.

The mini-bus reportedly plunged down a 20-metre ravine

The accident happened at Gellibrand Lower, approximately three hours south-west of Melbourne

'It is quite a remote scene and getting resources in there has been difficult.'

Emergency crews have freed the survivors and a critically-injured male passenger is being airlifted to Melbourne's The Alfred hospital.

The male driver and one passenger with serious injuries will also be airlifted to hospital, police say.

Three other passengers have minor injuries and are being taken by ambulance to Geelong Hospital.

The Great Ocean Road, a popular tourist drive, was closed to traffic between Princetown and Gellibrand River roads after the accident, which happened about 1.40pm on Thursday.
