An eight-year-old boy who was told he could have life-changing surgery to allow him to finally play football with his friends, has had the opportunity snatched away because of an ‘NHS shake-up’.

Joseph Hill suffers from spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs and means he has to rely on a wheelchair.

But he was given hope after being offered pioneering surgery - called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy - on the NHS.

Joesph (with his mother Angela) has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs. He was told he could have surgery on the NHS but then got a letter saying the operation had been cancelled

The operation would involve cutting the nerves in his spine to relieve the severe tightness in his legs.

The procedure, which was only previously offered in the U.S., became available at Joseph’s local hospital, the Leeds General Infirmary.

Joseph’s mother Angela Hill, 36, said: ‘We were delighted.

‘We were starting to think about raising more than £50,000 to get to America to let him have the operation and then it became available just down the road.

‘We just couldn’t believe our luck.’

But after assessments and consultations in which doctors helped Joseph plan for his upcoming surgery, his hopes were promptly shattered by a letter delivered to his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

As a result, Joseph's family (parents Allan and Angela, and sister, Emma) were left with no choice but to try and raise the £20,000 needed for the surgery themselves

The Primary Care Trust, who had organised the operation, was abolished and NHS England who took over shattered the hopes of Joseph, and five other children, by cancelling their operations.

Mrs Hill said: ‘One minute they were booking him in for the operation and Joseph was looking forward to being just like his friends, and the next a bog standard letter came through the door saying it had been cancelled.

‘He was really upset, and it was heart-breaking to see.

‘He thought he had everything coming to him and it was taken away from him in a heartbeat.

‘We are desperately trying to raise the money so he can have the operation before his ninth birthday.’

Joseph's story appeared on MailOnline on Monday, at which point the family had raised half of the target. Donations flooded in from generous readers and by Wednesday they had reached the target

The operation is now only available to Joseph if his family stumps up a staggering £20,000 for the crucial surgery, as well as paying further bills for his post-operative treatment.

They must try and raise the money in less than six months, as it is necessary for Joseph to have the surgery before his birthday in January, while he is still young enough to benefit.

Joseph was born prematurely at 34 weeks by emergency caesarean when his mother could no longer feel him moving.

At six-weeks-old, his parents were told he had suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen and he was later diagnosed with spastic diplegia.

Joesph needs to have the surgery before his ninth birthday in January or he will be too old to get the full benefits. He hopes he will eventually be able to play football with his friends

He has a walker to help him get around but he struggles with it, and needs a lot of physiotherapy to keep his muscles as loose as possible.

Mrs Hill said: ‘He loves watching football but he can’t run around and play football with his friends.

‘He’s getting to the age where he’s starting to notice he’s different. He doesn’t like sports day because he can’t compete properly to win anything and he feels left out when he doesn’t get picked for things.’

The surgery would mean Joseph could finally have complete movement in his legs.

Up until hearing about the surgery, families around the world have travelled to St Louis in America where experts routinely carry out the operation.

‘Trying to raise over £50,000 seemed like a very hard feat, and although £20,000 is obviously a big snip, it’s still a hard task,’ said Mrs Hill.

‘We’re doing everything we can, and Joseph is brilliant at thinking up fundraising ideas. He is having a game-athon soon to try and raise money.

‘We just want him to be able to run around with his friends and not feel like he is being held back.’

A spokeswoman for NHS England said they did not discuss individual cases but added: ‘NHS England’s current commissioning policy means that this procedure is not currently being routinely funded for patients in England.

‘Individual funding requests will continue to be considered where there are believed to be exceptional clinical grounds in an individual case.’

She said that NHS funding may be provided later this financial year for a small group of patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment.

Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut.

Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.
