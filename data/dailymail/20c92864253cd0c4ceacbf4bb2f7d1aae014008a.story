Twelve people died today during the bloodiest day yet of protests in Afghanistan over the burning of Koran copies found in a rubbish pit at a NATO military base.

Back in the U.S., GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich lashed out at President Barack Obama for saying sorry after copies of the Muslim holy book were found burned earlier this week.

Riot police and soldiers are braced for more violence after the Bagram compound burning deepened mistrust of NATO as it struggles to stabilise the nation before foreign combat troops leave in 2014.

Anger: Afghans shout slogans during a protest against the Koran burning in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Friday

Hundreds of Afghans marched toward the palace of their country’s President Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Friday, while on the other side of the capital protesters hoisted the white flag of the Taliban.

Chanting ‘Death to America!’ and ‘Long live Islam!’, protesters also threw rocks at police in Kabul, while Afghan army helicopters circled above and mosques in the capital drew large crowds.

Armed protesters took refuge in shops in the eastern part of the city, where one was killed, police said. In another Kabul rally, police were unsure who fired the shots that killed a second protester.

Seven more protesters were killed in Herat, two in Khost and one in the relatively peaceful Baghlan province, health and local officials said. In Herat, around 500 men charged at the U.S. consulate.

President Obama's apology was announced on Thursday and a few hours later it was reported that an Afghan soldier killed two U.S. troops and wounded others in retaliation for the Koran burning.

Campaigning in Washington state, Mr Gingrich said President Karzai now owes the U.S. an apology.

'There seems to be nothing that radical Islamists can do to get Barack Obama's attention in a negative way and he is consistently apologising to people who do not deserve the apology'

‘There seems to be nothing that radical Islamists can do to get Barack Obama's attention in a negative way and he is consistently apologising to people who do not deserve the apology,’ he said.

‘Candidly, if Hamid Karzai, doesn't feel like apologising then we should say goodbye and good luck, we don't need to be here risking our lives and wasting our money on somebody who doesn't care.’

President Obama apologised to President Karzai for the unintentional burning of the Korans at NATO's main Bagram air base after Afghan labourers found charred copies while collecting rubbish.

White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to counter criticism, telling reporters on board Air Force One: ‘It is wholly appropriate, given the sensitivities to this issue, the understandable sensitivities.’

‘His primary concern as commander in chief is the safety of the American men and women in Afghanistan, of our military and civilian personnel there. And it was absolutely the right thing to do.’

Muslims say the Koran is the literal word of God and treat each copy with reverence. Desecration is seen as one of the worst forms of blasphemy. Afghanistan wants those responsible on public trial.

In neighbouring U.S. ally Pakistan, about 400 members of a hardline Islamist group staged protests. ‘If you burn the Koran, we will burn you,’ they shouted.

To Afghanistan's west, Iranian cleric Ahmad Khatami told state radio that the U.S. purposely burned the Korans. ‘These apologies are fake,’ he said. ‘The world should know America is against Islam.’

‘It (the Koran burning) was not a mistake,’ he added. ‘It was an intentional move, done on purpose.’

Most Westerners have been confined to heavily fortified compounds, including at the sprawling U.S. embassy complex and other diplomatic missions during protests that have killed a total of 23 people.

The embassy urged U.S. citizens to ‘be safe out there’ and expanded movement restrictions to relatively peaceful northern provinces, where large demonstrations also occurred on Thursday.

The Taliban urged Afghan security forces on Thursday to ‘turn their guns on the foreign infidel invaders’ and repeatedly urged Afghans to kill, beat and capture NATO soldiers.

Germany, which has the third-largest foreign presence in the NATO-led war, pulled out several weeks early of a small base in the northern Takhar province on Friday over security concerns.
