A strict limit on sugar in pupils’ lunches is to be scrapped in a major overhaul of school meals, it emerged yesterday.

The
 decision, which provoked an outcry from health and obesity experts, 
comes less than a day after World Health Organisation chiefs demanded a 
sharp cut in children’s sugar intake.

Critics warned ministers against ignoring the WHO advice and wasting a chance to slash sugar intake.

Sweets for my sweet: A strict limit on sugar in pupils' lunches is to be scrapped in a major overhaul of school meals - less than a day after the World Health Organisation called for a sharp cut in children's sugar intake

One MP described the school lunch 
proposals, which are almost certain to be implemented,  as ‘puzzling to 
say the least’. Prescribed levels of fat and salt – as well as vitamins 
and minerals such as iron and calcium – are also set to be abandoned 
under the Department for Education plans.

Separate rules which dictate how many times certain items such as chips can be served during the week will remain in place.

Those
 rules will be expanded and updated, for example to specify that 
wholegrain food must be offered each week to provide fibre to children.

But
 more than a quarter of primary schools which trialled the proposed new 
system exceeded the old sugar limit – of four teaspoons per meal – by 
more than 10 per cent.

Nutritionists
 said ‘robust’ action is needed to meet a new target from the WHO, a 
subsidiary of the UN, to reduce adults’ sugar intake to 12 teaspoons per
 day and children’s to six.

On
 Wednesday UN health chiefs went even further, and said adults should 
aim to halve this to six teaspoons and children to less than six.

Unveiling
 its draft advice, WHO officials said sugar may pose the same threat to 
health as tobacco. It is increasingly implicated in obesity, heart 
disease and a range of other serious illnesses, they warned.

A
 single fizzy drink serving could exceed the six-teaspoon daily limit. 
At present, schools in England must comply with two sets of catering 
standards: one covering the frequency that specific items must be served
 during the week and another prescribing the levels of 14 nutrients in 
school lunches.

These 
nutrient standards stipulate that an average lunch in a primary must 
contain no more than 15.5g of sugar – equivalent to just under four 
teaspoons. In secondaries the limit is 18.9g, or four-and-a-half 
teaspoons.

Maximum limits 
are also set for fat, saturated fat and sodium, and minimums for key 
nutrients such as iron, fibre, zinc, protein and fibre.

The
 Department for Education, which commissioned chefs Henry Dimbleby and 
John Vincent to review school food, said caterers find current rules 
‘over-complicated’.

A 
consultation paper published yesterday said they were ‘difficult to 
understand’ and led to schools paying £20 for each recipe to be 
privately analysed. ‘The nutrient-based standards can restrict cooks 
from being creative,’ it added.

Under
 the plans, schools will no longer be required to prove they meet 
nutrient standards and will instead use new food-based standards to 
devise menus. These state, for example, that desserts, cakes and 
biscuits must be served only at lunchtime.

But in a trial of this approach, half of secondaries and a third of primaries failed to stay within the maximum sugar limit.

There
 would be ‘strengthened practical guidance on portion sizes for 
desserts’, in addition to existing limits on the quantity of fruit 
juices children can drink. Schools remain barred from offering fizzy 
drinks.

Professor Susan Jebb, an
 Oxford University nutritionist who helped draw up the new rules, said: 
‘If a school meets all of those food-based standards, it ought to be 
pretty close to meeting the nutrient standards we previously had. 
Schools can be confident they will be close to them.’

She
 said sugar consumption was already higher than the limit in some 
schools since cooks found the nutrient rules difficult to implement.

Newly-established academy schools will also be required to comply.

Tam
 Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘These guidelines come just
 days after the Chief Medical Officer [Sally Davies] confirmed sugar is 
the real disaster. The WHO report was our signpost to crack down on 
sugar.’

Katharine Jenner, a
 nutritionist at Queen Mary, University of London and Action for Sugar’s
 campaign director, said the WHO’s target was ‘such a long way from 
where we are’.

She added: 
‘Challenging taste preferences in childhood is vital because it affects 
the rest of their lives. We would want to look at this in detail and 
whether a child’s diet at school will be worse than it was before.’

Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘I believe parents will be extremely  disappointed by this decision.

‘Why
 the Government would want to reduce the healthiness of school meals is 
puzzling to say the least. The Government is going in the wrong 
direction.’
