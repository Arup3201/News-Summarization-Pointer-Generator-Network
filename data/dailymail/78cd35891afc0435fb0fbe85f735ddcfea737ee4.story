A cat was nearly killed after it was bitten by a false widow spider.

The fluffy tabby cat, called Hades, was attacked by the venomous spider in the bathroom of his home in Dover, Kent.

Owner Dawn Stephenson rushed her beloved pet to the vets where he spent two days fighting for his life on a drip while he recovered from the poison.

The 42-year-old said Hades, named after the Greek god of the underworld, usually lives up to his name and is 'a bit of a devil' but she became concerned when he started acting strangely.

She saw the feline chasing the spider in the bathroom then he leapt at it but quickly retreated and skulked back to his basket.

She said: 'He’s usually very active and is always out in the garden, but he wasn’t interested in interacting with anybody after the bite.

'He had a very high temperature and a very tender stomach.'

Hades, who had been bitten on the face, was taken to Maison Dieu Veterinary Centre.

Puzzled vets couldn't work out what had happened as they couldn't see the bite through his fur but after x-rays and tests they concluded he had been poisoned by the false widow spider bite. 

The lucky tabby pulled through and is
now recovering at home with Mrs Stephenson and twin daughters Rebecca 
and Kathryn, 13. She has been left with a bill of nearly £700 for his 
treatment, the Dover Express reports.

British Veterinary Association says although cases are rare, pet owners should be aware of the signs their animal may have been bitten, a spokesman said.

'Lookout for signs such as changes in behaviour, unwillingness to exercise, lethargy, lameness, swelling, loss of appetite and if your pet is showing any of these symptoms - seek veterinary attention as quickly as possible.' she added.

She said: 'Speed is of the essence and the sooner treatment can be given, the better. The important message is to seek veterinary attention quickly.'

The
false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider 
known to be in Britain and cases of people being bitten by the venomous 
creature have been on the rise.

Earlier this month, a rabbit in south Wales was killed by a false widow spider bite.

One-year-old Molly was found dead in her hutch which was infested with the poisonous creatures. Humans have also suffered after being bitten by the arachnid.

John Catlin, 66, from Bromley, Kent, is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down. Bodybuilder Gary Meadows from Teesville, Middlesbrough, required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since.

Layla Benton, 14, was off school  for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in Basildon, Essex. And last month Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire, had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there.

The spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or, to some eyes, a skull.

They have long, spindly legs and are easily confused with the black widow, a far more venomous cousin not found in Britain.

As with most species of spider, it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with.

Males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres, while females reach up to three centimetres.

The first false widow is thought to have come to Britain  from the Canary Islands or Madeira in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas. The first recorded sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

According to experts at the National History Museum, the false widow is not an aggressive creature, but prod it or intrude accidentally on its territory and it will give a defensive bite. How dangerous that bite is, seems to depend on the victim. Most will experience nothing worse than a short stinging pain, much like a wasp or bee sting.

But other symptoms can include numbness, severe swelling and discomfort or burning sensations.

Some victims have reported chest pains.

Others report swelling, tingling fingers and occasionally a general sense of feeling unwell and fever with symptoms lasting for a couple of days.

Advice from spider experts is to see a doctor immediately if you have an allergic reaction from a bite.

Pip Collyer, secretary of the British Arachnological Society said: ‘Try to take the spider with you so someone can identify it.

'But don’t, of course, touch the creature again.'
