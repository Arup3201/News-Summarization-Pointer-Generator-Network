Hand-carved from luxurious 75 per cent Tanzania Origin chocolate and measuring approximately 38cm high, this Easter bunny took two days to make … and costs a whopping £33,000.

The sumptuous sculpture, which weighs in at approximately 5kgs and contains 548,000 calories, has eyes of two solitaire diamonds with a combined value of £25,000, nestled into the chocolate.

The luxury chocolate rabbit was carved by award-winning Chocolatier and International Pastry Consultant and former Chef Décor of Harrods, Martin Chiffers.

Its two 1.70ct Round Brilliant diamonds - that are G Colour and GIA certified and boast VS clarity - are from luxury jeweller 77 Diamonds who possess the largest selection of diamonds in the world. 

They were chosen exclusively for inclusion in this exceptional never done before Easter creation.

Martin Chiffers said: ''I'm delighted to be working with 77 Diamonds on such a glamorous item which is certainly a culinary phenomenon. 

'Whilst I am very accustomed to teaching about and creating extravagant luxury chocolate pieces, incorporating diamonds is a first!'

The creative chocolate carving took two days to make and is extremely labour-intensive.

The truly a one-of-a-kind Easter delight has detailing which includes three solid gold-leaf decorated chocolate eggs at the foot of the bunny. 

Tobias Kormind, Managing Director of 77 Diamonds said: 'We are delighted to match exceptional diamonds to this decadent creation. We are also happy to create a bespoke piece of jewellery featuring the solitaires free of charge, once the bunny has been devoured.' 

Marcel Knobil, founder of VeryFirstTo, Superbrands and Cool BrandLeaders said: 'Whilst the detailing of the carving in this exceptional chocolate bunny is enough to make it truly special, 77 Diamonds has enabled us to catapult it into the top echelons of Easter gifts'. 

VeryFirstTo is also catering to those who wish to purchase the Bunny with different coloured diamonds and gems, or with lower cost gems.

And don't worry if you don't think your waistline could withstand the calories; the decadent delight can be displayed for two years, as long as the temperature is regulated to around 16 degrees.
