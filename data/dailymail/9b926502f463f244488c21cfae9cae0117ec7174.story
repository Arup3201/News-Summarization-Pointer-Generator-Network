Ivan Rakitic and Stephane M’Bia took post-match shirt swapping to a new level on Wednesday night as the pair decided they also wanted each other's shorts after Croatia defeated Cameroon.

Despite Rakitic's Croatia thrashing M'Bia's side 4-0 and eliminating the Indomitable Lions from the World Cup, the two former Sevilla players could still share a friendly chat before stripping down to swap kit.

Both players were vital to Sevilla's Europa League success last season, but Unai Emery's will almost certainly lose both players with Rakitic signing for Barcelona and M'bia returning to parent club QPR.

Croatia eased to victory against a poor Cameroon side as goals from Ivica Olic, Ivan Perisic and a double from Mario Mandzukic secured three points for Niko Kovac's side.

Cameroon started the Group A match without the injured Samuel Eto'o, and finished it without midfielder Alex Song.

With the score only 1-0, Song was given a red card in the 40th minute for elbowing Mandzukic in the back in an off-the-ball incident.
