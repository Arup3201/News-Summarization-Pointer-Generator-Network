This past year has provided us with a catalogue of major sporting incidents - with the World Cup in Brazil being the highlight of 2014 when it comes to football.

Manchester United's decision to sack David Moyes was big news in April and our coverage of the summer transfer window also attracted an impressive amount of readers to our website. 

Away from football and Jules Bianchi's horror smash at the Japanese Grand Prix was a major talking point in October. 

Here, in descending order are the top 10 articles on MailOnline in 2014:

10 - Jules Bianchi's horror smash at the Japanese Grand Prix

Back in October 2014 Jules Bianchi suffered a serious head injury following an accident at the Japanese Grand Prix.

The Marussia driver required surgery following the collision with the back of the recovery vehicle on lap 43 of the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka.

The 25-year-old is currently having rehabilitation therapy, and while he remains unconscious he is breathing unaided.

9 - Serbia vs Albania match abandoned by Martin Atkinson after drone used to fly flag over the pitch leads to violent scenes 

The match between Serbia and Albania was called off after home defender Stefan Mitrovic pulled down a flag carried by a drone - leading to chaos on the field and in the stands of the Partizan Stadium.

It led to the arrest of the brother of the Albanian Prime Minister and Serbia were handed a 3-0 victory after their opponents were deemed to have forfeited the match.

The visitors were also fined £78,000 for the incident on October 14, despite their claims of leaving the field due to being physically assaulted by Serbia fans, players and security staff.

 8 - David Moyes SACKED as Manchester United manager after ill-fated stint

He was proclaimed the chosen one after he took over from arguably the greatest manager of this generation - Sir Alex Ferguson - but things didn't quite pan out for David Moyes at Old Trafford.

The former Everton boss lasted just 10 months at the helm, getting sacked on April 22 2014, with United languishing in seventh place in the Premier League.

While United now lie third under new boss Louis van Gaal this season, Moyes is rebuilding his reputation in La Liga with Real Sociedad.

7 - Club-by-club guide to all the business done in the January transfer window

After the end of the January transfer window we tallied up all the deals from each club and put together individual tables for you to easily access.

The transfer which stood out from most in the January 2014 window was Juan Mata's £37million move from Chelsea to rivals Manchester United.

Then United manager Moyes would have hoped the Spanish playmaker would give his side a much-needed lift going into the second half of the campaign, but it wasn't enough to save the Scot's job as he was sacked later in the year in April.

5. Brazil thrashed by Germany in epic World Cup semi-final clash

The host nation were eyeing a spot in the World Cup final ahead of this match against the Germans, but those hopes would soon crumble as Joachim Low's men ran rampant.

Brazil were already 5-0 down before the clock hit 30 minutes in one of the most extraordinary World Cup games of all time.

Chelsea playmaker Oscar hit a consolation deep into stoppage time for the hosts, but it was too little too late as the Germans ran out 7-1 winners - eventually going on to win the tournament.

When Neymar went off injured against Colombia in the World Cup, Brazil's World Cup dreams were left in tatters.

Although they won the quarter-final 2-1, there was an air of despondency around the hosts after their star man was ruled out of the rest of the tournament.

Then, of course, it got worse against the Germans...
