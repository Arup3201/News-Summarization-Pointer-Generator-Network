Precariously balanced 2,000ft above a Norwegian fjord, there's no question that one slip would see Eskil Ronningsbakken plummet to certain death.

But despite bitter winds and a vertigo inducing drop, Eskil performs what he claims is the highest ever one-handed hand stand with graceful aplomb.

The extreme artist performed his jaw-dropping feat on Preikestolen, a rock perched high above the Lysefjord in Norway.

He managed to hold the one handed pose despite exerting his lower and upper arm to extreme pressure.

Taking acrobatics to new heights: Eskil performed part of the handstand using just one hand. He claims his feat is a world record for the highest one handed hand stand

Eskil, from Stange, Norway, said: 'Preikestolen is one of the coolest pulpit rocks I know about. I did my first performance here.

'It is 600m above the fjord all the way down, so if you fall there is no way back.'

Eskil, who began performing aged just five, added: 'When I started to balance at height, people didn't believe in me, they didn't believe this would ever become a job.

'They used tell me I was crazy and that one day I would fall down and die.Â

Nerves of steel: Eskil says the key to performing his death-defying stunts is to visualise the outcome - and taking it step-by-step

'Today the situation is different. I am travelling all around the world to perform and people love to watch and talk about what I do.'

Eskil says the key to performing his death-defying stunts is to visualise the outcome - and taking it step-by-step.

He added: 'The way I work is to always envisage an image of the action before I undertake it.

'This image follows me all through the working process. It is the drive behind everything I do. I want to create art and see a picture, see a dream coming true.

'Every time I start a project I begin safe on the ground. Then gradually I move step by step taking on bigger heights until I reach 600 meters where my goal lies.'

Stuntman: Eskil, pictured right, has been performing stunts since the age of five - though probably not quite as death defying as his latest, left

Doing handstands on the edges of skyscrapers and bridges, it seems that nothing fazes Russian parkour enthusiast Alexander Rusinov.

The 19-year-old stuntman has become an internet sensation in Russia after posting his videos online and hopes that his stunning acrobatic feats will come to the attention of the rest of Europe.

The teenager started practicising parkour after watching films of other daredevils on the internet and started training in a playground and in the school gym just a year ago.

Since then he decided to up his game and take advantage of some of his hometown Saratov's impressive architecture and began doing handstands on bridges over the Volga River jumping between rooftops and scaling walls.

He has since amassed an army of fans after posting his videos on YouTube.

Known as the Saratov Spiderman, he has said in the past that instead of fearing death, he prefers to imagine that he is safely on the ground while performing stunts.

Naturally, his worried family disapprove of his rather dangerous hobby.
