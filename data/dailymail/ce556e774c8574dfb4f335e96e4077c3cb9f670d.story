Exposed: Dressed in his finery, Thomas Lee Hornsby's wife discovered he was a bigamist after seeing this picture of his second wedding on Facebook

A husband was exposed as a bigamist after his wife saw photographs of his second wedding on Facebook.

Thomas Lee Hornsby, from Sunderland, split with his first wife in February 2011 after an affair with Joanne Henderson, who he then married without getting a divorce.

Hornsby, who has bipolar disorder, wed again in a ceremony on April 4 this year but his crime was revealed shortly afterwards after he posted pictures online.

The 37-year-old, from Sunderland, was exposed by his first wife after she spotted the images of him and Ms Henderson celebrating with guests.

Sunderland Magistrates' Court heard that Hornsby, from Pallion, Sunderland, had lied to a city registrar about being married when planning his new nuptuals.

Rebecca Laverick, prosecuting, said: 'A registrar at Sunderland Civic Centre said that she had had a meeting with the defendant and his new wife prior to the wedding ceremony.

'She said that they met on February 26 and went through the formalities.

'She questioned him about whether or not he had been previously married and he said no.'

A decree nisi was put in place in May 2012, but was not made absolute.

In trouble: Hornsby lied to the staff at the Sunderland Civic Centre (pictured) about still being married, and was sentenced today

Hornsby's first wife contacted the police after seeing the photographs of her husband with his new bride.

Caught: The 37-year-old's first wife said she was 'shocked' about the pictures especially as they were never divorced after they split in 2011

She said she was 'shocked and embarrassed' to find out about the deception via Facebook.

Hornsby admitted in a police interview that he had gone ahead with the ceremony knowing he was still married.

He had also pleaded guilty to the charge of bigamy at an earlier hearing.

Gavin Sword, defending, said: 'There was no financial gain in this case and no immigration issues.

'I don't think it (the wedding) can have come as any great surprise. They had been in a relationship for at least a year at this point.

'Whilst there was a deception to the registrar, I don't think there was to either of the two ladies in this case.'

Hornsby's marriage to Ms Henderson was deemed void after the deception was uncovered.

Magistrates sentenced him to eight weeks in prison, suspended for six months.

Sentencing Hornsby, chairman of the bench Eric Reay said: 'The reason for this is the deliberate deception you put about in the lead up to your second marriage.

'You deceived the registrar, you deceived your first wife and your new wife.

'This was deliberate.'
