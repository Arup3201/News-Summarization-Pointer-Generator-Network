Restraint: Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes, pictured, said show bosses could have shot a more graphic rape scene than the one which was aired on Sunday

Julian Fellowes 
has defended the airing of a rape scene in this week's episode of Downton Abbey.

Answering criticism that rape scene had been sensationalist, the Oscar-winning writer said he supported ITV's decision to screen the sex attack of a maid by a visiting valet.

In the episode, aired on Sunday night, Joanna Froggatt's character, Anna Bates, was attacked by Mr Green, played by EastEnders actor Nigel Harman.

It sparked more than 200 complaints to ITV and Ofcom with many saying it was too strong for a Sunday night.

However, Mr Fellowes said the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic.

He told the BBC: 'The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously. We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people.

'If we'd have wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down 
in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out.

'The
point of our handling is not that we're interested in sensationalising 
but we're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional 
damage.'

Joanne Froggatt has also defended the storyline, saying she is 'proud' of Downton Abbey for tackling the controversial subject.

The star said it was a 'brave' move by programme-makers to feature such a difficult scene in the normally gentile Sunday night series.

ITV
warned viewers about upsetting scenes before the start of the period 
drama, but it still received 'around 60 complaints' by Monday .

'Brave move': Joanne Froggatt has defended Downton Abbey after the rape storyline that featured on Sunday night's show caused complaints from shocked viewer

Froggatt said during an interview on BBC1's Breakfast on Tuesday: 'I was really proud of the show for tackling a subject like this. It's a really brave thing to do and I really do believe that Julian's written that in a way that is not gratuitous at all, he does very much go on to explore the emotional journey of Anna and Bates.

'He's done a beautiful job of hitting the right note with it. I think we all just felt a big responsibility to get it right.'

Froggatt, who was made aware of the storyline by producer Gareth Neame a week before she was given the script, said creators of the show did not want to show graphic violence on screen.

Research: The actress said she looked as testimonies from women who had been in similar situations to prepare herself ahead of shooting the rape scene

She said: 'Julian, and this is a credit to him, was adamant that we wouldn't depict that kind of violence against a woman on the screen and that's something that he didn't want in a show of his, that he's a part of, and that's an incredible thing in this industry in this day and age.

'And the shock value was there without having to depict anything graphic. The story is shocking enough, as it should be for a story of that essence.'

She said she had prepared for the role by looking at the testimonies of women who had been through a similar ordeal in those days - as well as modern women who had been reluctant to report attacks.

Disturbing: Despite a warning from ITV, many viewers were left stunned by the violent scenes of Joanne's Anna Bates being raped by Mr Green

In advance: Froggatt was made aware of the storyline by producer Gareth Neame a week before she was given the script

'I did a lot of research on the internet reading through people's stories of women who have been through similar situations, and women that hadn't gone to the police in this day and age because they were in a situation that came across as being vague when they were going to explain it - maybe they were at party or it was someone they knew and they were very confused by what had happened to them.

Defense: Harman also defended the show as he appeared on This Morning on Monday

'Now what I wanted to do - I wanted to get into my head as an actress - was to bring that to this time period.'

She said the programme's historical advisor had pointed out that women still had few rights back then which made them reluctant to report such an attack.Â 

'All you had was your reputation, your career, possibly if you had a job, and your family. There was still such a stigma attached to any sort of attack like this, that you were very much in danger of losing all of that.

'If a woman lost her reputation, that would bring shame upon the house - she could lose her job, she could lose her husband and society still saw it as no smoke without fire - "he's only a man, he couldn't help himself". it's very interesting to see that was only a hundred years ago,' Froggatt added.

Froggatt's comments come after Nigel Harman, who plays Mr Green in the show, also defended the storyline.

He said on This Morning on Monday: 'For a show like Downton Abbey it really leaps out as a bold and risky idea.'

The episode was seen by an average audience of 9.2 million according to overnight figures.
