Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has confirmed his interest in Galatasaray midfielder Wesley Sneijder but has revealed the south coast side would not be able to afford his wages.

Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that Premier League duo Manchester United and Southampton were planning to tempt the Holland star away from Turkey during the January transfer window.

Sneijder is desperate to quit Galatasaray at the start of the year and they are said to be keen on offloading the 30-year-old playmaker, who earns around £90,000-a-week.

Newly-appointed chairman Duygun Yarsuvat has been handed the task of easing the club's precarious financial position and Sneijder's apparent £2.5million wages are said to be an issue.

However Koeman, who shares the same agent as his fellow Dutchman, has stressed Sneijder's hefty wage demands are out of Southampton's budget.

Koeman, speaking ahead of the Saints' Premier League encounter against Everton, said: 'I am interested but we can't pay him.

'I know that because his agent is my agent. There is nothing in that. Seriously.'

Southampton's stance will boost Manchester United's chances of signing Sneijder if Louis van Gaal wants to link back up with the Dutchman.

It is understood Galatasaray will demand in the region of £9m for Sneijder.
