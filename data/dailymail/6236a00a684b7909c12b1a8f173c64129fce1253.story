Nine confirmed the investment in Quickflix was not a licensing agreement at this stage, but it was a small and opportunistic financial investment, which it believes offers an attractive risk-reward profile.

HBO, the maker of programs including Game of Thrones and True Detective, spent $10 million on its investment in Quickflix in 2012, soon after signing a licensing agreement with the streaming company.

Quickflix's market value has plunged since early 2012, with its shares falling from 13.8 cents to one cent prior to Monday's announcement.

The preference shares now held by Nine are not quoted on the share market, but can be converted to normal shares at a discount rate.

Quickflix offers streaming of movies and TV shows, from networks including HBO, the BBC and ABC to laptops, mobile devices and game consoles.

Its customer numbers fell during 2012 and 2013, but improved in the first three months of 2014 to almost 120,000.

Quickflix made a loss of $6.4 million in 2012/13, and a loss of $4.2 million in the first half of 2013/14.

Last week, US entertainment giant Time Warner - owner of the Warner Brothers movie studio and HBO - turned down an US$80 billion takeover offer from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, Fairfax reports. 

21st Century Fox's sister company News Corp Australia controls half of Foxtel, while Telstra owns the other half.  

The Quickflix investment will be held by Nine Entertainment alongside other minority investments.

HBO and Quickflix have been contacted for comment.
