Luis Suarez's summer move from Liverpool to Barcelona looks set to be the most costly deal in 2014.

The Catalan giants may have only had to pay a figure of around £75million for the Uruguayan but when taking into account the range of additional fees during his five-year contract, Suarez's move could potentially cost Barca up to £199m.

This far from princely sum eclipses the 2013 calculated total for Gareth Bale's move to Real Madrid, which looks likely to cost the La Liga leaders around £158m during the Welshman's stay in Spain.

Luis Suarez to Barcelona - £199m

Angel Di Maria to Manchester United - £190.4m

James Rodriguez to Real Madrid - £133.5m

Alexis Sanchez to Arsenal - £113m

Luke Shaw to Manchester United - £103.5m

Diego Costa to Chelsea - £102.7m

Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea - £100.3m

Juan Mata to Manchester United -£96.4m

David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain - £90.9m

Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City -£87.7m

Although Barca stand to spend the most on a single player, the 2014 Goal Transfer List, calculates that Manchester United's busy transfer windows in 2014 will eventually see the Old Trafford club having to part with close to £400m on the likes of Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw and Juan Mata.

Elsewhere, Di Maria's £60m move to United sees the Argentine in second place in 2014's most costly transfers, potentially commanding a figure of £190.4m once considering details such as original fee, tax, salary and length of contract.

Arsene Wenger, who has been accused of being reluctant to splash Arsenal's cash in recent years, will see his club fork out around £133m during Alexis Sanchez's time at the Emirates.

Gunners faithful will argue, however, that the diminutive Chilean has been worth every penny of his £35m fee after nine goals in 16 Premier League games so far this season.

Alexis Sanchez has already scored nine Premier League goals, but his deal could cost Arsenal £113m

The top 10 list, compiled by Goal, also includes four Chelsea deals with their Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas moves eventually costing the Blues over £200m while the £50m summer sale of David Luiz could cost Paris Saint-Germain up to £90.9m with Mata's January move eventually taking around £96.4m from United's pocket.

The 2014 list also shows the increase in club spending across Europe, with the combined cost rising by 27 per cent compared to last year's compilation.

Interestingly, nine of the top 10  deals in 2014 include at least one Premier League club while not a single club from Serie A or the Bundesliga feature in the big money moves.

James Rodriguez's move from Monaco to Real Madrid is the only transfer to feature on the top 10 list which didn't involve a Premier League club

Diego Costa came to Chelsea for £32m, but could cost the club close to £102.7m during his time in London
