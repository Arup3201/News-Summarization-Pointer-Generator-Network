Up to 15 gold miners in Australia have reportedly been sacked after they performed global dance craze the Harlem Shake and posted it online.

The men, who worked on six-figure salaries at the Agnew Gold Mine in Western Australia, made the video last week in a dripping underground vault surrounded by heavy machinery.

It begins as all Harlem Shake videos do, with one mask-wearing member dancing alone, before the film cuts to a group of 15 burly men - many topless - gyrating wildly to the beats of DJ Baauer's viral hit of the same name.

At one point, a miner performs the 'caterpillar' dance move in a muddy puddle as his colleagues cavort around him brandishing orange cones and poles.

But Barminco, the firm which owns the mine, unceremoniously relieved the men of their duties for breaching the companies 'core values of safety, integrity and excellence', according to a dismissal letter seen by newspaper The Western Australian.

One of the sacked workers, who would not be named, accused Barminco 
of being too heavy-handed, telling the paper the tradesmen were simply 'having a 
bit of fun'.

The letter stated that the workers have now not only been barred from the Agnew mine, but have been blacklisted by Barminco 'at any site domestically and globally'.

The sacked Australian miners are not the first 'Harlem Shakers' to land themselves in hot water for performing the rambunctious dance routine and posting it online.

On Friday, dozens of students were charged with violating the Egypt’s decency laws after they danced in their underwear to the song outside the headquarters of the north African nation's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in a light-hearted political protest (pictured).

A few days earlier, Tunisia’s Education Minister threatened to expel students and sack teachers at a school in the country's capital after they created a version of the meme.

Also last week a group of American college students were placed under federal investigation after they organised a performance on a Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to San Diego.

It is yet unclear what will happen to them or the air stewards who helped them rally passengers via the on-board intercom to take part.

Earlier this month University of Alabama freshman Nojan Radfar was facing expulsion for his attempt to create the largest Harlem Shake video ever by gathering hundreds of students on a central part of campus to stage the dance.

A Facebook page has since been set up in defence of the miners, sparking furious online debate.

'An
underground mine is no place for cowboys, clowns or fools. It’s an 
inherently dangerous place to work and workers are entitled to expect 
those working alongside them to respect the risks and abide by rules and
regulations,' wrote Greg Harris on Facebook.

But Stacey Hughes replied: 'Miners work their asses off for up to 4 weeks at a time, away from 
their family!! A bit of fun to pass the time and they get sacked.'

According to the firm's website, the Agnew Goldmine produces over 160,000 ounces of gold a year.

It says most low-level workmen typically operate on an eight-days on six-days off rotation, while more senior employees spend seven days below ground before a seven-day furlough.

As well as its mines in Australia, the company also has pits in Mali, Ghana and Egypt.

Up to 4,000 videos of "Harlem Shake" variations are uploaded on the Internet daily.

The concept is simple -  the videos are about 30 seconds long and set to Harlem Shake by New York DJ Baauer.

Each clip typically begins with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them.

Then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild, doing crazy dance moves around the room.

The song belongs to the trap genre of music and every video has put a different twist on the dance routine.

Many
of the performers wear facemasks or helmets, strange costumes and fancy
dress - there is commonly someone dancing in their underwear.
