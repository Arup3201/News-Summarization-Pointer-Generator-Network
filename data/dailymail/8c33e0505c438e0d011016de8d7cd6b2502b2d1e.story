Britain is set to enjoy the hottest Halloween on record this week after days of flash flooding in some parts of the country which saw a group of schoolchildren risk their lives by larking around on a flooded road.

Despite the heavy downpours which have blighted several regions over the last few days, temperatures are set to remain within the high twenties for the remainder of the week.

The Met Office said much of England and Wales will enjoy the above-average temperatures, which will see the mercury hit 21C - making Britain hotter than several European cities including Athens, Rome and Crete.

It comes after a weekend of downpours in some areas of the country, including in Dudley, West Midlands, where a group of schoolchildren risked their lives by playing in floodwater on a busy road.

The pupils, from Castle High School, could be seen dangerously joking around in the filthy floodwater, with one even lying down in a huge puddle in the middle of the road.

Wearing their school uniforms, the youngsters could be seen jumping off the pavement and splashing each other in the face as vehicles passed just inches away from them.

The worrying scene on Ednam Road - less than 400 yards from the school - took place while teachers nearby tried to keep traffic moving following torrential flash flooding.

Dudley councillor Khurshid Ahmed said he was worried the children's behaviour put them at 'unnecessary risk'.

He said: 'It's very dangerous. They do need to be more careful, especially as there is a big bend in the road making it more difficult for drivers to see.

'They shouldn't be putting themselves in danger like that and certainly shouldn't be lying down in the water or trying to have showers and messing about with their friends.

'I will be passing on my concerns to the school and also speaking to the highways department to see what can be done to prevent the road from flooding.'

One local resident, who did not wish to be named, added: 'Their behaviour was very stupid. There were teachers nearby who did nothing, these kids could quite easily have been killed.

'One of them was actually lying in the road, it looked like he had gone for a swim in his uniform. His parents would not have been happy when he got home, that's for sure.'

Castle High School headteacher Michelle King said she was trying to identify the pupils involved.

She said: 'If I can reveal the pupils identities I will deal with them appropriately and speak to their parents. I wasn't happy about what those students were doing.

'We had teachers getting saturated, trying to move the traffic along as it was gridlocked round the school, so I would like to thank them for their dedication.

'We did not receive any complaints about children from drivers in the area, and I have heard that some of the people involved were from other schools too.

'Traffic is always a nightmare on the roads around the school and then you add in flash floods and it becomes very difficult.'

Kicking back: As temperatures soared, a group enjoyed the sunshine with a boat trip on Swanbourne Lake in Arundel, West Sussex

Serene: The group made the most of the first day of the half-term holidays with a trip out on the water in Arundel, West Sussex

Tranquil: A group enjoyed punting down the River Cam in Cambridge today as temperatures soared to 21C in some parts of the country

Brave: Swimmers made the most of the above-average temperatures in London today by taking a dip in the Serpentine in Hyde Park

Chilly: Several members of the Serpentine Swimming Club joined swans in the Hyde Park lake in central London for their afternoon swim

Despite the flash flooding, temperatures started to soar across the country today – and the unseasonably favourable weather is set to remain until the weekend.

As temperatures reached 21C in parts of southern England today, families enjoyed splashing around in punts and rowing boats on the River Cam in Cambridge while others enjoyed the autumnal sunshine by relaxing in London's parks.

Forecasters at the Met Office said tomorrow is also expected to be unseasonably warm and sunny, with the mercury hitting 20C in the South.

After a brief respite of cooler weather and downpours on Wednesday, temperatures are expected to again soar on Thursday.

It means Halloween on Friday could become the hottest one on record, with the current record for October 31 standing at 19.4C in Margate, Kent, in 1968.

Laura Young, a Met Office spokesman, said: 'It is unusually mild for this time of year and it has been a really good start to half term week in the South.

'Parts of the South East could see 20C or 21C today, so it is very mild and there is lots of sun around.'

Plucky: One man tried to avoid the swans in the Serpentine in Hyde Park as he went for an afternoon swim despite it being October

Taking a dip: The swimmers enjoyed the serene conditions in Hyde Park as they dusted off the cobwebs in the favourable warm weather

Refreshed: The swimmers ventured into the water as temperatures reached 20C in some parts of the country today

However, despite the balmy weather forecast for England and Wales, it is a different story in the North West and Scotland, which will see two days of cloud, wind and rain.

The Met Office has issued an amber warning for rain in the Highlands until midday tomorrow and a yellow warning for Strathclyde, Central, Tayside and Fife.

The village of Kinlochewe in the Northwest Highlands has seen 172.8mm of rain in the last 60 hours.

The rain is set to move south on Wednesday, with showers in the South East, while the Midlands and North will enjoy a clearer day with a mix of sunshine and cloud.
