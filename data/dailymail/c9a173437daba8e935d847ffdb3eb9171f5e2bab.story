McQuen Forbush, 18, died Saturday in Nampa, Idaho

A young Marine died on Saturday in his sleep after his apartment filled with deadly carbon monoxide gas.

McQuen Forbush, 18, from Nampa Idaho, was discovered by his girlfriend just before 1 p.m. in the bedroom of the borrowed apartment where they were both staying.

The Marine was lying on his stomach at the end of the bed, cold and non-responsive, according to his distraught girlfriend.

‘I was shaking him, trying to wake him, I kept checking for a pulse because I didn't want to believe it,’ said Bre Halowell, who now wears Forbush's dog tags around her neck.

‘He was so still already ... When the police came they said he’d been gone for a while. I just shattered,’ she said.

Halowell told local reporters that she and Forbush had stayed up late the night before watching movies in their friend’s apartment. 

Both of them started complaining of headaches and dizziness, but neither realized that colorless, odorless carbon monoxide was seeping into the bedroom, courtesy of a faulty water heater.

"I asked him if he was OK and he said 'I'm fine - I'm just dizzy,'" Halowell told KBOI-TV. 'It didn't trigger in my mind that something was wrong.'

The young couple fell asleep, but when Saturday came, only Halowell opened her eyes.

'When I woke up in the morning, I couldn't wake him,' she said.

When emergency responders arrived at the apartment, they found Halowell performing CPR on Forbush.

Halowell was transported to a nearby hospital and kept overnight for treatment.

Forbush enlisted in June after graduating from high school and was sent to Camp Pendleton, California.

He was on his first leave since joining the military and had surprised his mother by showing up at her door Friday night.

The two had a joyous reunion, which turned out to be their last.

‘I got a call Saturday afternoon from Bre, his girlfriend, that I needed to get over to the apartment complex because they couldn't wake him up," Gretchen Hymas, his mother, told KTVB7.

McQuen Forbush, 18, died on his first trip home since enlisting in the Marines in June.

But she got there way too late.

'His blood levels were 57 when the fatal is 30, so he was way over that,' Hymas said.

His girlfriend said she knew something was wrong as they prepared to go to bed Friday, but was already too muddled by the poisonous gas to react.

Sagecrest Apartments near Nampa, Idaho, where McQuen Forbush died Saturday from carbon monoxide.

'My mind wasn't even registering what had happened all night,' said Halowell.

The owner of the complex, Sagecrest Apartments, told reporters they are still looking into exactly what went wrong.

Authorities have yet to release an official cause of death.
