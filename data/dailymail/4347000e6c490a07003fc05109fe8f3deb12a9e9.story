Front Row host Mark Lawson stepped down after disagreements with management

The BBC maintained a wall of silence yesterday over 'bullying claims' against its arts presenter Mark Lawson.

The Front Row host has stepped down from his Radio 4 programme after editorial disagreements with management.

But bosses refused to give any details of the issues or say if he will return to radio. The 51-year-old works for the BBC as a self-employed freelancer so he cannot be fired by the Corporation. Next week, the new series of his BBC4 show Mark Lawson Talks To... will go ahead as scheduled.

Lawson has not spoken publicly about his departure since the news was revealed  yesterday. Neighbours at his Northamptonshire farmhouse said he decided to ‘escape for a while’ rather than answer the allegations. However, some of the broadcaster’s friends have already leapt to his defence and accused the BBC of overreacting.

Writing on Twitter, author and journalist Tony Parsons – who wrote the bestselling novel Man and Boy – said he was ‘shocked and saddened’ by the news.

He added: ‘He is a real gentle giant and the BBC are starting to get hysterical. I worked with him for six years and I have never known anyone less like a bully than Mark Lawson. Total pro: respectful and friendly to all.’

During a two-decade long career in which he has had more than 3,000 guests on his show, Mark Lawson was proud of what he called his sensitive questioning technique.

In an interview last October, he said he was particularly keen not to encourage his guests to become too emotional.

‘I’m always uneasy both as a viewer and an interviewer with tears on TV because it is one  of the most private reflexes becoming public,’ he said.

But some production staff at the BBC Radio arts unit that produces Front Row claim to have seen a very different side to the presenter, labelling him a bully who was capable of reducing women to tears. According to one insider, the response by BBC management until now was to move any staff who claimed to be unhappy rather than to confront Lawson, because it didn’t want to risk upsetting one of its stars.

But with the recent launch of a BBC confidential 24-hour ‘bullying and harassment’ telephone line for staff and freelancers, the situation changed.

The BBC’s human resources department emailed staff, asking if anyone had been subjected to harassment. Within days of the email, a letter signed by 15 current and former production staff was sent to Graham Ellis, the deputy head of BBC Radio, which described a ‘culture of bullying and a failure of management to protect staff’.

Tony Hall, the BBC’s director-general, had also pledged a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to bullying after a critical report by a QC in the wake of the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal.

The report uncovered 37 complaints of sexual harassment and highlighted problems involving ‘known bullies’ and identified complainants who had been working in ‘a climate of fear and anxiety’. Lawson was not identified as one of the culprits, even though it is believed that management knew there had been ‘issues’ with his behaviour.

Bosses were not thought to be keen on action because Lawson was regarded as a ‘brilliant presenter’ – having interviewed some of the biggest names in the arts world, including Robert de Niro, Woody Allen and Helen  Mirren. But a senior BBC source said yesterday that after the  letter of complaint, an internal inquiry was launched last October involving two managers from Salford and two members of the human resources team.

Their conclusion was that  ‘Lawson’s position had become untenable’.

Lawson was born in St Albans, where he attended a fee-paying Catholic school before studying English at university in London.

He lives with his wife Sarah, two sons and daughter in a £500,000 detached stone cottage in Towcester. During the week, Lawson stays in a rented one-bedroom flat in fashionable  Notting Hill, west London.

As a freelancer, the BBC pays him through a service company, Wilanben, of which his wife is a director.

As he is taxed as a company director rather than an individual, the corporation tax he pays on profits is up to 20 per cent lower than income tax paid by other high-earners on PAYE. He has also been a columnist on The Guardian newspaper.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We don’t confirm or comment on human resources issues.’

An earlier version of this article said there had been a petition signed by 15 employees accusing Mark Lawson of 'browbeating' junior staff. We have been asked to point out that a letter signed by 15 employees criticised 'failures of management' and not Mark Lawson's conduct.
