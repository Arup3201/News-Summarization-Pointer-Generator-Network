However, as social media is meant to be a spontaneous snapshot of life, many people are not freely admitting to using technology to make themselves look better.

While countless selfies are posted on social media networks such as Twitter and Instagram every day, relatively few people disclose they have used photo touch-up technology by using a hashtag such as #Perfect365.

According to The Huffington Post, just 50,000 selfies on Instagram have been marked with the tag but the Perfect365 app has been downloaded a staggering 17million times since its launch in 2011.

‘You don’t know how long that photo is going to live or how long the impression that you’re putting out there will last,’ she said.
