Paul Lambert is contemplating handing 18-year-old Jack Grealish his first start for Aston Villa in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup tie at home to Leyton Orient.

But the Villa manager insisted he will not put any pressure on the talented winger to make a call on his international future one way or another.

Grealish has played 18 times for Ireland at various youth levels and is in the Under 21 squad for a UEFA qualifier against Germany on September 5 – but still qualifies for England having been born in Birmingham.

Decision maker: Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert must decide whether to start Grealish

Despite Roy Keane’s presence on both the Villa and Ireland coaching staff, Lambert has promised to let the teenager make up his own mind.

Grealish, who spent last season on loan at League One Notts County, has two substitute appearances for Villa – and came on for the final 19 minutes of the 1-0 win at Stoke on the opening day.

He would have got minutes against Newcastle before Aly Cissokho limped off with injury but it set to start his first match against Russell Slade’s team.

'I was going to put him on on Saturday and then Aly got hurt,’ said Lambert. ‘There’s a chance he’ll start, I don’t have a problem throwing him in. He’s growing up a lot and is still 18 years of age.

'He’s done ok and he's got miles to go in the game. I don't talk about his international career. It’s not something we talk about. I can’t influence that. He’s gonna have to get used to it but its a great problem for him to have.’
