A British father has died of a suspected heart attack after heroically rescuing his sons caught in a riptide off an Australian beach

The 44-year-old man, who has yet to be named, is believed to have suffered a heart attack when he dived into the water to help his sons at Burrill Beach, near the port of Ulladulla, south of Sydney, yesterday.

Witnesses said he ran into the water when he realised the boys were in trouble, believing they were caught in a rip - a strong undercurrent.

He managed to rescue his sons from the water, but then suffered a cardiac arrest.

He was pulled onto the beach where attempts were made by locals to save him with CPR, reported the Milton-Ulladulla Times.

Paramedics who arrived also applied CPR, but the Briton was pronounced dead on arrival at the Milton-Ulladulla Hospital.

According to the paper, this was the second death at Burrill Beach within a month.

A Filipino national drowned there last month.

Police said a report was being prepared for the coroner, while the man's family, who were with him on the beach, have been offered counselling.

Burrill Beach is a popular spot among holidaymakers at this time of the year, the height of the Australian summer.

But the Beachsafe website warns that Burrill Beach and a nearby sandy area are rated as 'highly hazardous' due to the persistent rips.

'However both are popular with 
holidaymakers in summer, so stay in shallow water...and avoid the rips 
and feeder currents; and in the south use extra caution near the inlet 
entrance,' says Beachsafe.

The beach is backed by 10 to 20m high dunes and a central caravan park with a walking access to the beach.

Rips are found every 300m and against the nearby headland, Beachsafe warns.
