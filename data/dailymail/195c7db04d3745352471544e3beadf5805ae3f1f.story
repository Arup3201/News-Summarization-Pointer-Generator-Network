Fred lit the fuse for another Brazilian victory as the World Cup hosts signed off preparations with a sturdy but certainly not spectacular 1-0 win over Serbia in Sao Paulo.

Six days away from opening the World Cup on the other side of the city against Croatia, Luis Felipe Scolari's side endured a frustrating first-half that ended with the crowd on their backs.

But a much improved showing after the break - with Chelsea's Willian shining after replacing the unimpressive Oscar - saw them narrowly home.

On a sodden Sao Paulo afternoon when a
 subway strike crippled the metropolis of 20 million people, World Cup 
cheer wasn't exactly flowing freely on the streets.

But at Morumbi, the 
67,042 packed into the home of Sao Paulo FC formed a yellow wall of 
noise to welcome their front-liners, six days before they begin their 
quest for history.

One of 
the few criticisms of Scolari is that he can be loyal to a fault but 
with this staring XI - the very definition of tried and trusted - it is 
hard to criticise.

Sculpted during last summer's barnstorming run to the
 Confederations Cup title, Scolari could have named it for the opener a 
full year out.

The wonder is that the 2002 World Cup winning coach, who 
has always had a lucky streak, has made it to six days out without a 
single injury concern over any of his starters.

Being
 able to reunite Thiago Silva and David Luiz at the heart of the 
defence, after the skipper missed Tuesday's romp against Panama, would 
have been a relief too. Scolari's Brazil have never lost under the 
pairing, winning ten of the previous 12 and keeping six clean sheets.

Challenge: Brazilian forward Neymar is closed down by Chelsea's Ivanovic

But
 vital as captain Silva may be to the cause there was no doubting who 
the near full house were here to see. Neymar left his home of Sao Paulo 
after the Confederations Cup to try to do in Europe what he had done 
here for five years previously with Santos - electrify. If his first 
season at Barcelona only featured glimpses of that talent, his adoring 
masses here didn't care.

From
 his first touch, the roars rolled around Morumbi's bowl. It took just 
five minutes for him to make a first opponent look silly, Milos Jojic 
hacking him down after being outfoxed.

There
 were to be only intermittent moments like that in the opening period as
 the World Cup hosts struggled to find the rhythm and incision that 
carved Panama to pieces. It was left to Manchester City's Aleksandar 
Kolarov who fired the game's first shot in anger wide of Julio Cesar's 
post 11 minutes in.

Another 
of the visitors' Premier League contingent, the giant Nemanja Matic, was
 making his presence felt in midfield and when the Chelsea man crossed 
for Aleksandar Mitrovic soon after the half hour, the lone frontman 
should have done better instead of flashed his header wide.

Save
 for a nice turn and shot from Fred at the other end and and a David 
Luiz free-kick that sailed high into the Sao Paulo sky, there was little
 to cheer for a crowd that are notoriously fickle. The jeers that rung 
around the arena at Enrike Kaseres' half-time whistle left Scolari's 
crew in little doubt that six days before they face Croatia in the same 
city, this was not good enough.

Two
 days after the birth of a baby daughter, the out of sorts Oscar was 
withdrawn at the inter Willian on the other hand is a man in form, well 
out of national team contention just 12 months ago, he now finds himself
 the go-to guy off the bench. And he immediately added some much needed 
spark to proceedings. The crowd were still not convinced though, 
bizarrely chanting the name of Sao Paulo FC striker Luis Fabiano - long 
since out of national team reckoning.

Maybe
 that was the spur for current No.9 though as less than five minutes 
later it was Fred who finally broke the deadlock.

Thiago Silva angled a 
ball to the edge of the box where the Fuminense man outmuscled Branislav
 Ivanovic and Dusko Tosic, controlled and in spite of losing his footing
 and fired into the far corner.

It
 was a goal that was all down to strength and endeavour, what the 
sometimes criticised frontman is all about. It was also the cue for a 
festa in the stands, Mexican waves and chants ringing around the place 
in the last half hour.

Message: Serbia players held up a banner as the two teams lined up before the game

Jojic
 almost broke up the party on 69 minutes but missed a great opening with
 a poor header and Lazar Markovic tamely shot at Julio Cesar soon after.

At the other end Hulk had a
 second wrongly disallowed for offside after a superb through ball by 
Neymar but it did little to delate the atmosphere. The biggest roar of 
the night went up on 80 minutes as Neymar was withdrawn.

It
 might not have been a vintage night from him and it may not have been a
 vintage night from his team but Brazil still got it done. They will 
return here on Thursday with momentum. The world have been warned.
