Great Britain's Desiree Henry and Ashleigh Nelson will vie for 100 metres gold on Wednesday night, although Asha Philip missed out on the European Championships final by less than a hundredth of a second.

On a blustery night in Zurich, Nelson and Henry secured automatic progress to the final by finishing second in their heats.

Teenager Henry equalled her personal best of 11.21 seconds as she finished behind overwhelming Dutch favourite Dafne Schippers, who she will again line-up alongside in the final later this evening.

'I can't believe it,' the 18-year-old told the BBC. 'I just had a relaxed approach and I was determined to enjoy it.

'Dafne Schippers, we're virtually training partners and she's always encouraging me. I'll get ready for the final now, I can't wait.'

However, British hopes of a three-pronged attack in the final were dashed as Philip missed out by the smallest of margins.

The 23-year-old, former champion Verena Sailer and Celine Distel-Bonnet were all tied on 11.24 secs, with the latter taking the fastest loser spot when it went to thousandths of a second.

'I'm extremely disappointed,' Philip said. 'I don't know how I didn't get myself into a European final.

'After the Commonwealths and World Indoors where I've come out and done that, there are not many words that can describe how I'm feeling. I'm disappointed and feel like I've failed.'

Flying the flag: Ashleigh Nelson also finished second in her semi-final to set up a gold winning opportunity

There was to be no shock exit in the 400 metres semi-finals as world champion Christine Ohuruogu booked an automatic place for Friday's final, finishing just 0.02 seconds ahead of Poland's Malgorzata Holub in her heat.

Great Britain will be without a representative in the men's 400 metres hurdles later that night, though, as national champion Niall Flannery, Tom Burton and Sebastian Rodger all failed to make it through the semi-finals.

The latter's season's best of 49.47s was not enough, while Ireland's Thomas Barr also missed out.

There looks a strong chance of success in the men's 400m after Great Britain won all three semi-finals, with 32-year-old Conrad Williams winning the first from lane eight.

Martyn Rooney crossed the line in 45.40 in the next, before exciting prospect Matthew Hudson-Smith went quicker still in reaching the final.

The 19-year-old was the fastest of the qualifiers, winning in 45.30 to put him in with a good chance of adding to the 4x400m gold he won at Glasgow 2014.

'I got out this time which I'm actually quite proud of because I was a bit nervous,' Hudson-Smith told the BBC. 'This is all new to me, a real experience and I'm learning from it.

'I've done exactly what I want to do so far. To get three of us in the final is great. A British one-two-three would be the dream but it's one step at a time.'
