Levi Stevens, son of Jon Stevens, posted a cryptic message of support on his Instagram on Monday following his father's arrest for allegedly assaulting his fiancée Jodhi Meares.

The heavily tattooed 21-year-old, who follows in his father's footsteps and works as a performer describing himself as an 'MC', posted the quote just hours after the former Noiseworks singer was picked up by police in Sydney's exclusive Point Piper.

'When you're mad at someone you love, be careful what you say because your mind gets angry but your heart still cares,' the post read.

The New Zealand-born star and brother of New Zealand Idol judge, Frankie Stevens, was released on bail and is reportedly set to appear in Waverley Local Court relating to the incident on Thursday.

Levi has previously taken to his social media three months ago on November 15 to post a picture of Chris Brown alongside Rihanna along with the message:

'Sometimes u love people so much that despite what they put you thru, you'll always be there.'

Chris attacked Rihanna at a pre-Grammys bash in 2009 leaving her bruised and battered.

He was charged with assault and continues to face a public backlash against his domestic violence actions, but famously did get back with Rihanna for a short period in 2013.

 Levi also took to his social media three months ago on November 15 to post a picture of Chris Brown alongside Rhianna

All together: Levi appears to have a healthy relationship with his step-mother-to-be, joining her and his dad on holiday in Hawaii last month

Levi seems to have a healthy relationship with his step-mother-to-be, joining her and his dad on holiday in Hawaii last month, while Jodhi regularly takes to her own social media account to share snaps of him.

In January, she shared a picture of Levi's tattooed hand with a tiny lizard crawling on his fore finger and another of him getting a substantial 'Polynesian tattoo' on his leg.

'Levi Jay- finishing what he started two years ago- finally made it back to Hawaii to complete his tattoo with the incredible artist Donavan. #levijay #donavan #tattoo @dazed_tnr #polynesiantattoo,' she captioned it.

Ex: Jon split with his wife of 20 years Tracey in 2007 before he moved into realtionship with Jodhi

New man:  She has since moved on from the marriage and is dating a man called Jonny

She also often likes snaps posted on social media of Jon's two grandchildren Summer and Leo from his daughter Millie.

Jon split with his wife of 20 years Tracey in 2007. 

She has since moved on from the marriage and is dating a man called Jonny. 

Message of support? The designer's company The Upside posted this quote, which appears to  reference the situation

According to Channel Nine, the incident between Jodhi and Jon allegedly occurred after the former wife of billionaire James Packer discovered text messages on 53-year-old Stevens' phone. The Daily Telegraph reported claims the messages were in emails and were from an ex-girlfriend.

Jodhi is alleged to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist.

Police confirmed that officers arrested a man in his 50s at a Wolseley Road property in the early hours of Monday morning before charging him with assault. 

Incident: The assault is the second incident for Jodhi in just eight months after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June last year, recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181

Crash: Jodhi collided with three parked cars when she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi on June 21 last year

The Sydney Morning Herald reported police were called to the couples' exclusive Point Piper home after the alleged fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. 

The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault. It is believed the AVO could be dropped.

The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds.

'Haunted' by marriage: Jodhi married billionaire James Packer in 1999 and split from him in 2002

A-list: Jodhi and then husband James in 2001 at a Channel Nine function 

The assault is the second incident for Jodhi in just eight months after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June last year, recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181.

In the wake of that event, The Upside posted similar inspirational quotes, apparently in relation to Jodhi's situation. 

Attributed to Kurt Cobain, it read: 'I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not.' 

Moment of pride: Model Jessica Gomes paraded Jodhi's label The Upside down the catwalk at the David Jones Autumn/Winter launch last week, with the founder watching on from the audience 

Just last week, an account in the name of Jon Stevens didn't take well to some people on social media criticising Johdi for last year's drink driving incident.

One user commented: 'Hope she doesn't get p***** & stack her 4wd afterwards.' Stevens hit back, writing: 'Hope you don't choke on your own vomit.'

He wasn't finished there, the rant posted in the early hours of Thursday continuing:

'Your poor taste just shows what a pathetic person you must be ... as with everyone makes mistakes and nobody got hurt in Jodhi's accident thank god ... and she completely put her hand up and took full responsibility for her actions which I reckon you don’t know how to do that coz you must be perfect? But I doubt it very much as clearly you are a very boring person that has never made a mistake in your life...'

The user replied: 'No I'm not perfect Jon but I have lost a family member through the actions of a drink driver.'

Stevens recently showed support for his fiancee by slamming users on Facebook who criticised Jodhi for her car accident
