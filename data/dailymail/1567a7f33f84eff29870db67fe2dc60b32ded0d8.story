Some 350 stores in the Clinton Cards business are to close.

The firm of administrators brought in to run the businesses after it was unable to repay loans totalling £35million announced the decision this  afternoon.

As well as 200 Clinton Cards outlets, 150 stores from the sister chain ‘Birthdays’ will also close.

Closures: 200 Clinton Cards stores and 150 Birthdays stores will close

The stores are across the UK and employ some 2,800 people who will soon be looking for work.

The closure programme, which will leave the group with 438 outlets, will begin next week and continue through into June.

The company has made losses of £130 million since 2004.

Its takings are insufficient to cover the cost of staff, rent and rates.

Joint Administrator and Partner at Zolfo Cooper, Peter Saville, said the closures are necessary under a plan to try and sell a slimmed down version of the greetings card business as a going concern.

Gloomy predictions: The company announced in March that it had slumped to a first half loss and warned that its prospects for the second half were worse than originally anticipated

Clintons's announcement follows a turbulent period for Britain's high street.

Last month Mothercare axed 100 job when it closed 100 stores.

Another of the U.K's iconic stores Woolworth's, folded in 2008 under huge debt.

It was the first in a wave of closures that rocked the country's high streets.

News of Woolworth's demise came on the same day as furniture chain MFI said it would be closing its doors.

Store closures have become familiar news for the retail sector while a number of shops have announced plans to slim back their operations.

Chocolate retailer Thorntons recently announced it is to close 180 of 579 stores over the next three years.

The alcohol market has also been hit with off-licence group First Quench, which owns Threshers and Wine Rack, announcing it will close more than 750 stores in 2009 with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.

Plus-sized womenswear chain Peacocks collapsed into administration in January, which will lead to 1,400 jobs across its stores.

  

He said: ‘Given the sheer size of the Clinton Cards retail estate and the overall performance, we were left with no alternative to today’s difficult decision.

‘I am hopeful that the action we have taken will allow us to preserve value in the core underlying business, thereby allowing us and potential buyers to focus on a profitable and viable retail estate going forward.’

Clinton has suffered dire trading in recent months as it comes up against stiff competition from supermarkets and online retailers such as Funky Pigeon and Moonpig.

It recorded a pre-tax loss of £3.7 million in the 26 weeks to January 29, compared with a profit of £11.7 million in the previous year, and warned that the second half of the year would be below expectations. Its shares had lost more than 80 per cent of their value since the start of 2010.

Last week, it revealed more poor trading for the 14 weeks since January 29, with same-store sales down 3.5 per cent.

Chief executive Darcy Willson-Rymer carried out a strategic review over the past six months, which is understood to have included a fruitless search for a buyer for all of the business or its Birthdays chain.

The group was the UK's largest specialist retailer of greetings cards and was founded by current chairman Don Lewin in Epping, Essex, in 1968.

Its collapse is another blow to the high street after recent high-profile casualties, including video games retailer Game Group, fashion chain Peacocks and outdoor specialist Blacks Leisure.
