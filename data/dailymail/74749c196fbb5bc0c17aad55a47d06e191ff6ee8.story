The only survivor of a Kentucky massacre last week has been charged with the murders of his parents, his veterinarian sister and a family friend. 

Ryan Champion had claimed to police that one of his alleged victims, his friend  Vito Riservato, 22, was responsible for the horrific killings in Cadiz, Kentucky, on October 26. 

He was taken to a hospital for shock and police at the time said he was being treated as a witness and a crime victim. 

Champion, 36, was arrested on Friday and charged with shooting dead Riservato, along with Lindsey and Joy Champion, 62 and 60, and 31-year-old Emily Champion.

Sole survivor: Ryan Champion claimed in a TV interview that he 'turned the tables' on Vito Riservato. Police now say Champion murdered his friend Riservato

Victim: Police named Vito Riservato, 22, as a suspect in the horrific murders. They now say he was a victim and was gunned down by his friend Ryan Champion

Within hours after discovering the four bodies - spread across the Champions' horse farm, police named Riservato as the suspect in the murders. 

Champion, after his release from the hospital, even gave an interview to local media. 

He told  WSMV-TV that he 'was able to turn the tables' Riservato after the 22-year-old killed his family. 

'He got close enough to me that I could turn the tables, and that was it. Every minute the entire thing was going on, that's all I was waiting for. I was waiting for an opportunity,' he claimed. 

Police have not offered a motive for why Champion allegedly murdered four people. 

He worked as a contractor in town and had recently been evicted from his apartment.  

Immediately after Riservato was named a suspect, his friends and family said that the young father could never have been responsible for the horrific crimes.

'Anyone who knew Vito knows he's not a killer. He was a loving father and a good friend. I don't want his name to be tarnished just because someone can't own up to what they have done, its so sad how someone has to pin it on someone who is no longer with us,' his ex-girlfriend Bekah Kuser said on Facebook.    

In his TV interview, Ryan Champion claimed he was spared because the killer did not see him as a threat. He declined to elaborate further on the killings, citing the ongoing police investigation.  

The Champion family was attacked after returning home from the Cadiz Church of Christ, where Lindsey Champion is an elder.
