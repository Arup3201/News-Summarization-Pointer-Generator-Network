Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after fracturing his foot against Swansea.

The England youth international, 19, was taken off on a stretcher during the 1-0 victory in Wales.

Ward-Prowse had played in every Premier League fixture for the Saints this season, and boss Ronald Koeman admits his absence will be a blow.

'We're very disappointed, but that's football and that can happen,' Koeman told the BBC. 'It's unlucky but OK.

'The boy has to keep going and it's difficult because he had a great start to the season, but it's part of the football and he will come back.'

The injury also rules Ward-Prowse out of England's opening European Under 21 Championship play-off against Croatia.
