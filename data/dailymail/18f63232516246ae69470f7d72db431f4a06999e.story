Sinead Dewar, 25, was jailed after a vicious attack which left Jessica Moran, 34, with multiple head injuries after attacking her with a stiletto heel

A strip club dancer who stamped on a colleague’s face with her 6in stiletto heel after arguing over a glass of wine has been jailed.

Sinead Dewar, 25, left 34-year-old Jessica Moran in 'continual pain' from her injuries after punching her five times in the face at Room 32 in Preston, Lancashire.

She then repeatedly kicked and stamped on the victim's head as she tried to crawl away.

Preston Crown Court heard that Ms Moran suffered a fractured cheekbone and eye socket following the attack in the dancers’ changing area of the club.

Dewar launched the 'sustained attack' after Ms Moran, who was working her first shift at the venue, confronted her about a glass of wine she claimed was taken before she finished drinking it.

The court heard that the argument broke out in the customer area of the bar on June 28 last year.

The head dancer stepped in and said they should sort things out away from the customers.

Downstairs in the changing area, Dewar launched the vicious attack with a 6in pair of cream stiletto heels.

Ms Moran, who has been forced to leave her job since the attack, now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as nightmares and anxiety attacks.

Jailing Dewar, Judge Niclas Parry said: 'You used persistent and repeated violence using a very dangerous form of footwear.

'She asked if you had taken her glass of wine and an argument flared up. You punched her in the nose and, having been shaken by that, you punched her again, causing her nose to bleed.

The 'sustained' attack took place at Room 32 in Preston, Lancashire, after a row erupted over a glass of wine

'You threw four or five punches and you gripped her by the neck as you punched her in the face.

'You proceeded to kick and stamp on her several times. With the heel, you stamped on her head many, many times.

'She
 tried to crawl away and you stamped on the back of her legs. You used 
your foot and for the most part a very large stiletto heel.'

He added: 'Her left eye was completely closed up from the abrasions. It took four days before she could open it.

'She
 cried through the night and she was terrified that in the morning her 
infant son would wake to see the state you had left her in.

'Her son saw her the the following day and saw her face which was injured by you.

'Once a bubbly person, she now suffers flashbacks and anxiety attacks. She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and struggles sleeping.'

Sarah Johnston, prosecuting, told the court that the attack on Ms Moran, who now has a constant shadow in her left eye, has also impacted upon Ms Moran’s family and her social life.

Dewar, who suffers from Asperger syndrome, denied the offence but was convicted by a jury of causing actual bodily harm in March this year.

Dewar, from Blackpool, Lancashire, cried in the dock as she was jailed for 16 months.
