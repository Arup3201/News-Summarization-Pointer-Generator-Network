It may be the tallest obelisk and stone structure in the world. 

But the Washington Monument - standing opposite the Reflecting Pool and Lincoln memorial - has shrunk.

Government surveyors have determined a new height for the US capital's landmark - about 10in (or 25cm) shorter than it was 130 years ago.

The Washington Monument has shrunk by about 10 inches since it was built to honour George Washington

The new official measurement, which will be unveiled today, puts the monument at 554ft, 7in (169m) as measured from the floor of the main entrance to the top. 

Ever since the stone pillar was completed in 1884 to honour the nation's first president George Washington, the historic height has been recorded at 555ft, 5in (169.2m).

The only observable height change was the pyramid-shaped tip had been rounded off over time. 

Surveyors in 1934 also noticed the peak had been rounded and attributed this to frequent lightning strikes that melted the aluminium tip.

The graphic shows how the Washington monument was built over the years - it ran out of funding in 1858

But experts now dispute that and say the difference is down to where the base point is measured from. 

Dru Smith, chief geodesist with the National Geodetic Survey, said: 'The building didn't change height because of anything; it is just where you start from,'

The original measurement conducted in 1884 used four brass markers as a base for measurement. 

Those markers remain in place 9in (22cm) below ground – and it is possible the markers were at ground level in the past.

A new plaza was installed around the monument more recently, also likely changing ground level. 

Despite the new measurement, the Park Service said it would stick to the existing height and would not change any brochures.  

When the monument was completed in 1884, it was the world's tallest structure until 1889 when the Eiffel Tower was built.

It remains by far the tallest structure in the nation's capital, which strictly restricts building heights.  

The monument was damaged during the Virginia earthquake and Hurricane Irene in 2011 and remained closed to the public while it was assessed and repaired.

After 32 months of repairs, it reopened  to visitors on May 12, 2014. 

The monument has shrunk in size by 10 inches since 1888, as the graphic demonstrates
