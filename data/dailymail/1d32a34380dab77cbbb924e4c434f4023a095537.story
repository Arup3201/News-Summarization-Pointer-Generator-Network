Tim Hauser, the founder and singer of the Grammy-winning vocal troupe The Manhattan Transfer, died Thursday from cardiac arrest, band representative JoAnn Geffen said Friday. He was 72.

Hauser founded Manhattan Transfer, who released their debut album in the early 1970s and launched hits such as 'Operator' and 'The Boy from New York City.' They went on to win multiple pop and jazz Grammy Awards. Their critically acclaimed album, 1985's 'Vocalese,' earned a whopping 12 Grammy nominations.

Alan Paul, Janis Siegel and Cheryl Bentyne — who joined in 1978 and replaced Laurel Masse — rounded out the foursome.

'It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of Tim Hauser’s passing with you all...,' they said in a statement. 'As many of you know, Tim was the visionary behind The Manhattan Transfer. We spent more than 40 years together singing and making music, traveling the world, and sharing so many special moments throughout our lives... 

'It's incomprehensible to think of this world without him. We join his loving wife, Barb, his beautiful children, his family, and the rest of the world in mourning the loss of our dear friend and partner in song. 

'Love, Janis, Cheryl and Alan.'

Hauser first formed Manhattan Transfer in 1969 with Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, Gene Pistilli and Pat Rosali. They disbanded and Hauser met some of the band's new members as a taxi driver in New York City. He met a conga player while driving who introduced him to Siegel and he also met Masse while driving.

Hauser once described a 1956 experience to The Asbury Park Press in which 'This little kid comes over to me with makeup in his hand and it was Frankie Lymon. He asked, "Do you know where the dressing rooms are?" and I did, because I used to go to the Boy Scout jamborees that were held at Convention Hall.'

'[Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers] sang 'I Promise to Remember' a cappella and I was maybe 18 inches from them if not less sitting there — I could literally reach out and touch them,' he also told the newspaper. 'I swear that was my turning point. That was God's way of saying, 'Here's your gig, son and if you don't get it, it's not my fault.'

Hauser was born in Troy, New York. He is survived by his wife Barb Sennet Hauser, his son Basie and his daughter Lily.

Manhattan Transfer will continue their upcoming tour despite Hauser's death. Their next show is Oct. 23 in Manchester, New Hampshire.
