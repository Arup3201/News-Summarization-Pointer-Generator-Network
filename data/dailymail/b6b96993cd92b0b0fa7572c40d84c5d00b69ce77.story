An unlicensed drunk driver who killed a 16-year-old boy in a horror crash last month and then posted a picture of his totaled vehicle with a smiley face on Facebook days after the tragic accident, has been jailed. 

Michael J. Vanwagner, 24, of Coon Rapids, Minnesota, caused two crashes on July 22 along Highway 252 in Brooklyn Park.

Although he has yet to be charged in the two accidents, he has now been jailed for violating terms of his probation from a 2013 felony conviction.

Abstaining from alcohol and remaining law-abiding are among the many conditions of Vanwagner's probation stemming from a June 2013 conviction for knife-wielding terroristic threats he made against a romantic rival

Michael J. Vanwagner, 24, of Coon Rapids, was arrested Friday and is being held without bail before a Monday court hearing.

A warrant for his arrest was issued a day after Jason McCarthy, of Brooklyn Center, died from injuries suffered when his car was struck July 22 by Vanwagner on Hwy. 252.

Abstaining from alcohol and remaining law-abiding are among the many conditions of Vanwagner’s probation stemming from a June 2013 conviction for knife-wielding terroristic threats against a love rival.

On the day of the accident, the 24-year-old ran into  McCarthy's in his second car accident, slamming into his car at around 60 mph.

On the 
Saturday before McCarthy died, Vanwagner posted the insensitive photo of
 his car on his Facebook page with the caption 'That's her front end 
after I got done with her lol.'

Under a second photo, he commented: 'I'm all good slept a day in the hospital then came home and did yard work lol.'

He acknowledged posting the picture but said he didn't even know he hit somebody.

'I just thought I hit something,' he said. McCarthy died just a few days later and the photos were removed shortly afterwards.

The State Patrol said it suspects Vanwagner had been under the influence of alcohol when he hit one car, took off and then struck McCarthy’s vehicle.

After last month’s crashes but before McCarthy died, Vanwagner posted photos of his severely damaged car on his Facebook page. He removed them after the teenagers' death

An eyewitness, Roy Peterson, saw the entire episode play out including both accidents.

Speaking to the Star Tribune he says Vanwagner was driving recklessly.

'He was in his car after the initial wreck, heading down Hwy. 252 with no regard for anything else around him,' he said on Tuesday.

'Then he came to a complete stop in the middle lane,' Mr Peterson said. 'Everyone was aware of him.'

Peterson said he pulled up next to Vanwagner and saw 'his head rolled over to the left on the seat cushion, and his eyes were rolled back in his head.'

He called the police but before anyone could stop Vanwagner, he had driven off.

Peterson watched Vanwagner’s accelerating car 'go all the way down the left-hand turn lane. There was no sign of brake lights' before the collision with McCarthy’s stationary car unleashed enough force to 'lift both of them up.'

He rushed to help but there was no response from the teenager.

Vanwagner was conscious in the aftermath 'but he had that blank look. … He was in a fog.'

Officers suspected he had been drinking and could smell alcohol on his breath.

Tragic: The teen victim, Jason McCarthy, pictured, was rushed to North Memorial Medical Center where he clung to life for days before dying on Tuesday

Jason McCarthy would have been a junior 
at Champlin Park High School. He was an honors student and played bass 
guitar in the high school band and with friends in a rock band called 
the Crak Pots, his aunt Brigid Klaysmat told the Star Tribune.

'He loved trying everything and had a very adventurous spirit and a wonderful sense of humor,' Klaysmat said.
